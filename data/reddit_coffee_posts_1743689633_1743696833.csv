""I don't know what you're doing with these thugs,"" Shadow Wing said. ""But you’re not going to work this part of town. Go get your ass handed to you by the new hero and leave this neighborhood well enough alone.""

""No need to pull the tough guy routine,"" I said.

I was a little annoyed, but I was also impressed. I avoided Shadow Wing professionally, but he had a pair on him. It wasn’t every day a hero got a chance to go up against the great and powerful Night Terror, and it really wasn’t every day they stood up to me when they got that chance.

It would’ve made for an interesting evening of toying with him if it weren’t for the fact this wasn’t the hero I needed to find tonight, damn it.

Those glowing eyes narrowed. Now that was an interesting trick. How did he manage to pull that one off? There was no rational explanation for how the infrared illuminators on a pair of night vision goggles would narrow like that. 

Maybe it was a special modification? I wasn’t one to talk when it came to modifying tech exclusively to do something that looked cool.

“What are you doing in my territory?” he growled.

Now it was my turn for my eyes to narrow.  ""Not that it’s any of your business, but I'll tell you exactly what I was doing here.”

The unspoken promise there was I was willing to tell this wannabe hero what I was doing out here tonight because he wasn’t going to survive this encounter. I know people liked to mock villains who got caught up in doing a monologue and then got their asses handed to them, but that wasn’t how I operated.

I found it far more efficient to gloat about my genius plan just long enough that a hero thought they might have a chance to defeat me and then vaporize them.

It was a hell of a lot easier to keep a hero from trying to foil my plans if they were free floating molecules that had been a person in a hero suit of wildly varying build qualities moments before.

“I was fishing for a hero.""

Shadow Wing brushed a speck of dirt off of his suit. ""Fishing for a hero?""

""Sure,"" I said. ""I was hoping I could lure Fialux with a little damsel in distress routine, but I'm assuming since you're out here she's not going to be found on the side of town, which is really putting a cramp on my plans and…""

The attack was almost faster than lightning. The only problem is I was ready for it. The instant he darted forward I activated the anti-Newtonian stasis field and his fist stopped an inch from my face. 

It wasn’t exactly catching Fialux off guard, the power involved in the punch this wannabe threw was orders of magnitude less than anything Fialux could throw around, but it was a start.

At least that proved I could stop someone with the stasis field if they weren’t putting out the kind of power Fialux was capable of. After all, this guy was obviously a mere mortal for all the impressive gadgets he had.

And now that he stood there in the glow of the stasis field? I could get a good look at the hero behind the mysterious shadowy figure who was so terrifying to the criminal element in this alley that they'd almost peed themselves when their buddies started disappearing.

I could appreciate that. I was all about putting on a show while I worked, and I felt a kindred spirit in this hero. I could respect someone who spent all their time working around the fringes of the law, for all that Shadow Wing was doing it in service of vigilante justice rather than outright breaking the law.

Shadow Wing glared at me. And when he glared at me it was a glare that seemed personal. I didn’t bother asking when I’d pissed in his Wheaties, though. There were a lot of people in this city lined up for a ticket on the Night Terror train.

Occupational hazard when you were the best worst villain the world had ever seen. I’d stepped on a lot of toes on my rise to the top. Maybe this one even got into heroics because of something I’d done. Swore revenge and all that.

It wouldn’t be the first time I’d gone against someone who got into the hero business because I’d done them wrong. Not that it was going to do him a damn bit of good.

The guy looked to be in pretty good shape, which I knew from the stories I’d heard. I suppose that's to be expected for a normal who kept himself in good enough shape to go out and tangle with criminals on a nightly basis.

I walked in a circle and gave him a good once over. He wore a dark gray form fitting suit very similar to what I wore. Though it looked like the asshole had taken the time to sculpt abs and pecs on the thing rather than just working on the abs and pecs and having them show through the suit.

No cape. Which was a sensible choice for a mortal hero. Fialux could get away with a cape since she was impervious to practically anything and it didn't matter if she got tangled up for a few minutes while a giant death robot pounded her with every weapon in its arsenal, but a mortal hero had to worry about that sort of thing.

“So you’re Shadow Wing?” I asked as I came back around to his front and planted my hands on my hips.

“I am,” he growled.

It was weird. His voice sounded slightly distorted coming out of the field. Which made sense, but I hadn’t exactly had a conversation with Fialux while she was trapped in the field intent on kicking my ass.

I looked up to the sky overhead. Not that there was much to see in the sky up there. For a place called Starlight City there was enough light pollution that the only thing you could really see in the skies was occasionally the moon when it was full.

Well, the moon when it was full and all the various spotlights with heroic silhouettes projected up into the light pollution and adding to the problem. That had gotten really out of hand ever since the Supreme Court ruled that displaying a spotlight like that was technically free speech and now it seemed like every other rooftop in the parts of town that were good enough to afford it but bad enough to have some crime sported one.

At least until the hero behind the light gave up or got themselves killed. That was the problem with projecting your personalized hero spotlight from a building where you lived instead of waiting on the police to need you enough that they put it on the roof of headquarters. It was a good way to advertise to any villains in the area where you lived.

Not that I’d taken advantage of that to track down a hero who was annoying me and ruin their life to the point they had to leave the city. I’d totally never even consider doing something like that.

“Wasn’t that name already taken?” I asked. “Some low level chick who got herself splatted against the side of a building fighting a giant irradiated lizard?”

Odd, that. Most lizard species reacted to radiation the same as every other multicellular thing that was exposed to radiation. They died. Either via rapid cell death or slow cancers depending on how great the exposure was.

Of course if there was going to be a species of iguana that reacted to radiation by growing to gargantuan size and going for a stroll through downtown it would be in Starlight City. This place was like a beacon for weird shit like that.

The asshole tensed when I mentioned the former Shadow Wing. It was enough to make me wonder if maybe there wasn’t something going on there. Maybe a personal connection.

It would be really sad if this guy was out to avenge his dead wife who got it in her head she was going to be a hero and found out, too late, that there were consequences for trying to sit at the big kid table when you weren’t ready to give up the sippy cup.

Not my problem though. This guy was about to learn the same lesson. If for no other reason than there was something about him that irritated me more than anyone had ever irritated me before.

Well, maybe not as much as Rex Roth, but it was close.

“I’m Shadow Wing,” he growled.

I rolled my eyes. “You’re going to have to do more than repeating your hero name if you want to impress me. I know you’ve made a name for yourself beating up street level criminals, but I’m in a totally different class of bad guy.”

""Whatever you have planned, you won't get away with it,"" Shadow Wing said. “You won’t defeat Fialux.”

“Actually I’m pretty sure I am going to get away with it,” I said.

“Never!”

“Will so!”

“No you won’t!”

I stomped. “Yes I will! Because right now my evil plan doesn’t extend past vaporizing you and I’m pretty sure that’s going to be pretty easy to do with a cut rate wannabe!”

Yeah, this guy was really irritating me. Who the hell did he think he was challenging me? I was at the top of the A list and he was strictly bush-league.

I leaned in until I was inches from his face. The glow from his night vision goggles disappeared and his eyes appeared beneath his mask. I felt like I'd seen those eyes before somewhere, but who knew? 

The city was lousy with secret identities, and who was to say I hadn't run into this Shadow Wing's secret identity at some point? Hell, he could be the barista where I got my coffee every Friday, or a cop I avoided vaporizing on a regular basis. There was no telling.

Pity he had to cross me now while I was on the job and in a more vaporizing mood. Especially if it turned out to be the nice guy who made that wonderful coffee at the Starlight City University coffee shop.

I put a hand under his chin. One of the fringe perks I’d discovered with my newly developed stasis technology was that whatever I wanted not moving definitely couldn't move, unless it was Fialux of course, but it was keyed to my biometrics. So if I needed to manipulate the field all I had to do was reach out and touch whatever I’d caught in my web of super science. 

Something happened, but it wasn’t the vaporizing I was expecting. No, his eyes turned a dark black and I staggered back.

Huh. That was unexpected.

How can someone maintain such unwavering positivity and feel the need to spread it to others? It’s not that I don’t experience joy or enjoy simple pleasures. I, too, can feel happy and optimistic when savoring a delicious croissant with a cup of coffee at a French bakery, eating mcnuggies while binge watching my favorite anime to escape reality, or falling in love. I’m not saying it’s impossible or wrong to feel this way from time to time, nor is it that I don’t want others to experience happiness or be optimistic about certain things. But for some, their existence seems to be wrapped in relentless positivity, no matter how painful and insignificant their reality may be.

When you think about it, in the grand scheme of the universe, we are infinitesimally small. We don’t know what awaits us after death, if anything at all. And all the suffering, inequality, and countless hardships in the world are just impossible to ignore. How can someone be overly optimistic and happy all the time in the face of such realities? There is no inherent law or order in the universe, no karma or sacred force restoring balance as many people believe or hope. The universe, and hence our lives, is chaotic, unpredictable, and likely to remain so. In contrast, those who are excessively optimistic tend to believe in concepts like order, karma, or some deeper meaning, which I see as detached from objective reality. From my observations, many of these individuals rarely question anything. They don’t ponder their existence, their lives, the future, state of humanity or the universe itself. Even among those who do, most lack the capacity to fully grapple and comprehend with such ideas. Some who come close to understanding seem to cope by turning to religion or other comforts to dull their unease, all while maintaining their optimism.

Considering all this, how is it possible for me to not to feel disdain for those who remain overly optimistic in the face of the visible chaos, pain, and disorder that define our existence?",0,1743696212.0,nihilism,0,0.5,False

1jqmap7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humanitystory/comments/1jqmap7/the_days_of_love_and_service_the_vocation_of/,The Days of Love and Service: The Vocation of Caretaking,"Millions of Americans know firsthand the joys, responsibilities, and hardships of caregiving.

[In the United States, 53 million people are caretakers. Biba Kayewich](https://preview.redd.it/j46o62m3pkse1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d6aba21f74006007a1772623a61cf3c3d2ddf6f)

The alarm sounds every morning at 6 o'clock, but as Anne Wagner explained, no one’s off to work or school in this Mocksville, North Carolina, household. Since 2022, Anne has been the primary caretaker for her husband, Ric, who retired in 2019 as the CEO of Piedmont Federal Savings Bank.

“It’s time for the first medication, and then I do early morning exercises with Ric. When you have Parkinson’s, you have to think big and act big, because one of the characteristics of Parkinson’s is that everything is small. Your writing is small, your voice smaller. So we do the big exercises first, moving our arms and shouting out when we do that about four times.”

Using a walker, Ric then makes his way to the bathroom, where Anne helps him into the shower. After starting breakfast preparations in the kitchen, she helps her husband dress.

“He has trouble bending over, and I help him just so he can get moving faster in the morning,“ she said. ”Then I prepare breakfast. We also begin the morning with prayer and reading. One of the things Ric does is he reads to me in the morning, and I read to him in the evening, a devotional that’s all Scripture.”

According to the online [article](https://www.guardianlife.com/reports/caregiving-in-america) “Standing Up and Stepping In,” 43.5 million Americans in 2015 were caring for a spouse, a child with special needs, or an elderly parent, relative, or friend. Today, that number has jumped to 53 million. The average time spent caregiving has also taken a bounce, with about three-quarters of these people spending 10 hours to more than 30 hours every week assisting loved ones.

Anne is just one of these caretakers who every morning begins a new chapter in a special story of care and deep affection.

# Excursions

Although routine—exercises, timed medications, and the necessities of living—commands their days, Anne spices up this regimen with some fun and adventure.

“Ric and I bought a golf cart, and since he can’t go very far with the walker or the rollator, we drive through the countryside—we live in the country—and that really helps him,“ she said. ”Occasionally, he’ll drive the golf cart with me in it, because he can no longer drive a car.”

Anne also plans outings farther away from the home and the neighborhood. On Wednesdays, for example, the couple goes out to lunch or dinner at a restaurant, and every 10 days or so, she plans a day trip for them, driving into the nearby mountains or even just to another area of town.

“It gets us out of the house, like a date,” she said.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, a caregiver comes to the house for four to six hours. While there, he takes Ric to the local Rock Steady Boxing, which is part of a chain of gymnasiums using the pugilistic arts to ease the symptoms and slow the progression of Parkinson’s. On these days, the caregiver frees up Anne to go shopping, pick up prescriptions, and occasionally have lunch with friends.

These are also the days that she can spend more time with her 94-year-old mother.

# A Vocation of Love

Beginning in 1990, Anne and her family lived as next-door neighbors to her parents. During that time, with her own two children still at home, she helped care for her father, who suffered ill health and Alzheimer’s disease before he died in 2021.

“It was during COVID, and I couldn’t even be with him,“ she said. ”It was beyond terrible.”

When her mother suffered a stroke in 2002, Anne assumed responsibility for her care as well. She helped with the cooking, shopping, housekeeping, and medications. After her mother and father entered an assisted living facility in 2015, she made visiting her parents a part of her routine. She continues to visit her mother regularly.

“There are occasions where I get Ric into the car, and we go together,“ she said. ”Sometimes, he’ll wait in the car, and sometimes, he uses his rollator to go into the room where we both encourage my mom.”

If life gave out degrees for such accomplishments, by now, Anne would likely have earned her doctorate in caregiving.

And millions of other Americans would qualify for that same degree.

# Invisible Volunteers

Many of these caregivers also work at jobs outside the home. The combination of caregiving and employment results in added stress and expenses, and it negatively affects the U.S. economy because of absenteeism and the loss of jobs. Moreover, busy caregivers are less inclined to attend to their own health needs, which then creates additional problems and expenses.

This stress and overwork can quickly become a mental burden as well. Forty percent of caregivers reported that their duties negatively affected their stress levels.

# 4 Caretaking Essentials

Well aware of the toll that these responsibilities take on caregivers, Anne counters with four main strategies: physical exercise, personal time, perspective, and faith.

# Physical Exercise

In addition to joining her husband for his exercises, Anne works out on her own.

“When he’s in the kitchen in the morning, shaving and having his quiet time, I do online exercise so I can stay in shape and fit, and he’s excited for me to be able to do that, to just have that time,” she said.

# Personal Time

In addition to her Tuesday and Thursday hours when she shops or meets a friend for coffee, Anne makes sure that she takes some extended time for self-care. When she spoke to The Epoch Times, for instance, she was taking some rest and relaxation at Emerald Isle on North Carolina’s Outer Banks.

“I really have some ‘accountability friends’ that I’m down here at the beach with who pray with me all the time back home,“ she said. ”These gals are bringing me coffee in bed, which is just awesome to be cared for by others, knowing that you have to replenish your caregiving batteries.”

# Perspective

Our attitude regarding any situation, Anne said, also heavily influences how we handle it. For more than 40 years, she and Ric had crossed paths, but it was only when Ric was widowed and Anne divorced that a nudge from a mutual friend brought them together. They fell in love, and marriage followed in 2015.

Seven years later, Ric was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Anne immediately took on the role of primary caregiver.

“You know, in sickness and in health, till death do us part,“ she said. ”We were all in, 100 percent all in. So there’s a whole new chapter being rewritten with God as our anchor. He’s always my anchor. And he was even in the time before Ric, and it was for Ric the same way.”

# Faith

That mutual faith is a powerful bond.

“We greatly appreciate each other and the Lord bringing us together, and so there’s been just great joy in the midst of the difficulty, and Ric is as kind and compassionate and loving to me,“ she said. ”That keeps me going, and we sing a song, ‘This is the day that the Lord has made,’ back and forth to each other almost every day. Ric is truly a champion. He encourages me and is a joy to care for.”

Alongside that image of God as an anchor, Anne applies a different metaphor for caregiving.

“I’m a keeper of the springs,” she tells people. “A keeper of the springs is someone who keeps the trash out of the water source, which is the life source, and keeps the water flowing so that their family can be nourished and healthy. That was and is my job, to provide the food and the home as the keeper of the springs.”",1,1743696119.0,Humanitystory,0,1.0,False

Or maybe just carb addiction?,"I’m on 1.0mg of Sema and have lost about 25 pounds since starting my weight loss journey on December 22. Despite this, I don’t find the Sema to be a complete failproof solution for weight loss.

Although I’m not often physically hungry, I’m still obsessing about food. A lot. This is my first time losing weight with an old-fashioned calorie deficit — previously I have done low-carb diets to lose weight, and had good success doing that, losing 100 pounds on two separate occasions. I feel like perhaps because I have kept sugar in my diet, I haven’t been able to break free of that addiction. Because make no mistake, sugar is an addiction. I think consuming sugar/carbs makes me have this constant food noise of what I’m going to eat next.

The only time I found that that food noise went away, was when I was eating very low-carb (under 20 net grams of carbs/day) and forced my body into ketosis. Only then did food become something that was not constantly on my mind. I started making food choices based on health rather than pure taste. Food was finally just fuel — not entertainment. My next meal was no longer a constant preoccupation.

It’s just crazy to me how strong carb addiction is. I’m assuming that’s my problem rather than the Sema being ineffective at its current dose (that seems unlikely since I am losing, albeit slower than I did when I was in ketosis). 

The ongoing food noise is getting to be annoying because I’ll order ingredients to cook something I’m craving, or order some particular food I think I’m craving, then I take one bite and realize I don’t even want it because (thanks to the Sema) I’m not physically hungry. Then I waste food/money.

If nothing else Sema gives me the extra help to be able to stop myself from one of these food binge episodes where I act like it’s life or death until I get a particular food. But you still have to have enough motivation to put the fork down and step away yourself. It doesn’t happen automatically.

I should mention that my last bloodwork came back slightly prediabetic, so in all honesty I probably *should* be eating low-carb, but I’m truthfully too addicted to my fancy sugar-laden coffee to make the switch completely.

I wish I could get the courage to just go low-carb again. I felt so much better doing that way of eating, and if I’m going to be taking these drugs, I might as well try to maximize their effects, right? Taking my eating more seriously than “I’ll just eat less” might behoove me, who knows.

Anyone here have experience with keto, Atkins, or another very low carb diet? Did you have only moderate weight loss on Sema until you eliminated sugar?",1,1743695772.0,Semaglutide,2,1.0,False

1jqm26l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqm26l/unravelling/,Unravelling,"I don't know how long the pair of us stood there staring at the door, listening to the knocking, and the barely heard voice that whispered. I think, maybe, each one of us - those of us still able to listen and focus - heard something different in those whispers. Me? I heard an offer, a choice. My name, my \*self\* and I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore, I wouldn't have to hurt anymore. I could be at peace.



I knew that was a lie though, Adam - that was his name, the man that had pulled me in here - confirmed those suspicions when I told him what it was whispering.



""There's no peace in oblivion, you'd have to exist, to be real to feel that. If you listen to that thing, if you take that offer, there won't be a you around anymore to care.""



The thought of death...I don't want to die, but it wasn't frightening to me. I've always viewed it as just another part of life. Not something I want to happen, not something pleasant, but inevitable and necessary all the same. But being unmade? Having everything about me erased? To never have existed? The thought of that terrified me, made me nauseous, and made it easy to resist the whispering voice.



""Has this happened before?""



It was my voice that broke the silence once the knocking and whispering had finally ceased. Adam's only response was a single shake of the head, his gaze remaining locked on the door. I tried to get something more out of him, anything more, but he remained quiet and still. He didn't seem afraid, though, more so that he was deep in thought, and slowly becoming resigned to whatever he was considering.



""When did you first notice things were changing?""



His question, out of the blue and completely ignoring my own threw me off guard as I blurted out the answer, ""Just a few days ago, maybe two, maybe three?"" I replied...and immediately wished I hadn't as I watched the dread slowly overtake his features.



""Too fast, they're never this fast."" He muttered, I don't know if he intended me to hear that, I think he was more talking to himself, but there was no way I was going to ignore that.



""What do you mean too fast? Is this something you've seen before? Who the fuck even are you?"" My questions were hissed out in rapid succession, I was frustrated, afraid, and needed answers like I needed to breathe, but I remembered to stay quiet. They couldn't get in, the previous...however long had proven that, but I didn't want to draw the thing attention back to us.



""Adam's not my name, you know?"" Out of all the things I thought he might say, that wasn't one of them. Not even close. ""I don't think it is, at least. I don't remember what it might have been. I took the name Adam because..."" He hesitated here, a look of frustration and despair crossing his features, ""I think it had something to do with whoever was here before me.""



At that I glanced back to the people clumped around the room. Even those who were faded and faint were paying attention now as Adam spoke.



""These things, they've always been around. And someone has always had to be here. In this place. I don't know what it was before, I don't know what it'll be in the future. Right now it's an empty store with a breakroom that has shit coffee on tap, and me. I've been here...I can't remember. It feels too long, and it feels like it's not been nearly enough time, but I've been here. I remember the ones that have faded, I forget myself, and I keep them at bay. Mostly."" 



As Adam fell silent, the entire room stared at him, those that were faded, those clinging on, and me. I stared and tried to poke holes into his story, tried to find some way for it to be a ruse, a lie. But what sane person would go to the lengths I had experienced for a trick, a joke? Not to mention what I'd experienced. Pieces of myself just...vanishing, like they'd never been there. My cat....my cat. It hurt that I couldn't remember their name. I could remember the feel of the fur under my hands, the sensation of them purring as they laid on my chest at night. I could remember these little, wonderful things, but not their name.



""What..."" I tried, and had to clear my throat with a ragged cough that held the notes of a sob, ""What do you mean you remember the ones that faded? How does any of that keep...keep whatever that thing was, things like it, from doing whatever they want?"" I asked Adam. There was no demand in my voice, just a wavering request hidden in the words, begging for answers, for a solution, for a way to just magically fix it all. He had none of that to give me, though.



""This place... it can’t hold together without an anchor. Without something that remembers, holding everything in place. I don't know how it does it, or why... I only know that it works, why I have to be here, because the person before me knew this and told me, and the person before them, and so on."" He paused then, looking at me with something akin to pity in his eyes.



""It's for that reason I know, too, that if this happening so fast now, if they're getting so bold, my time is running out. You could say I'm...degrading, and it come time for someone else to stay here."" As he spoke, in the background I could hear one of them speaking, just a name, repeated over and over again. I don't know who's it was. Maybe they didn't either. But in the quiet, the name was repeated.



""Someone else? Who, exactly?"" I asked him, dreading the answer. Knowing what it would be, and praying I was wrong.



""You already know who. Everyone here, look at them...us. Even the one's fighting to stay real, they're too faded. But you? You have most of yourself, you've lost pieces but not nearly as much as the rest."" He paused then, stepping closer to rest a hand on my shoulder. The weight somehow both solid, unyielding and at the same insignificant in a way that left me wanting to recoil from the touch.



""For what it's worth, I'm sorry.""



At that I finally grew angry, angry that this was happening to me, angry at his assumption that I'd just take his spot in this fucking purgatory, ""What the fuck do you mean you're sorry? I don't have to do this, I don't have to be here, I can leave! I can go..."" All the built up anger, the steam I had vented dissipated in a rush, leaving me feeling unsteady without it holding me together as I realized there was no home for me to go to. There was no job waiting for me, there was no cat. Soon, if he was telling the truth - and it seemed like he was - there'd be nothing left for me...and eventually there'd be no me.



Adam just stood there as I yelled, looking as if he'd been expecting that exact reaction. As I went quiet, he just nodded, as if following along with my train of thought - though by the look on his face it was clear he wished he didn't.



""If you leave, what's happening to you will continue to happen. Bigger and bigger pieces of your life will vanish until..."" He trailed off, but his words echoed my thoughts. Leaving meant being unmade, ultimately. But staying? It didn't feel like a better option.



""Will I end up like them, if I stay here?"" I asked, my voice small and meek, like a scared child asking a doctor if the shot was going to hurt.



""No, not like them. You'll take my place, be the new anchor. You’ll lose your name, your edges - but some part of you will hold. Maybe not clearly. Maybe not knowingly. But it will hold."" His words were meant to be a comfort, I think. If so, they were a old one, at best. When I didn't reply, he watched me, looking me over as though searching for something. Whatever he sought, he must have found. Adam gave a nod to the others in the room, the faded and not, and they all began to draw close, forming a tight circle around the pair of us.



""You don't have to do anything."" He told me as he reached out to grab my hand, ""Just listen, remember. That's all."" 



""What happens to me?"" I asked as I clutched to his hand like a lifeline.



He gave my hand a squeeze, offering me a sad smile. “You stay. You remember. Until you can’t anymore. Until someone who needs to finds this place, and you pass on the burden. And you rest.""



The way he said rest, I knew he meant a genuine rest. Not oblivion. Not an unmaking. It was strange how much that filled me with relief, the knowledge that while I might die, I wouldn't be unmade in the end. When my turn was up.



""Right. Right."" Was my only reply, what else could I say that would sum up what I was feeling. Nothing could come close, everything I could think to say fell short. I gave a nod then, and that was when a woman came up, faded, flickering on the edges, and began to speak, “My name was Emily Muir. I liked the rain. I worked in a flower shop that smelled like wet dirt and crushed petals. I was engaged. His name was Lyle. He forgot me first.”



Her voice started faint, like an echo, but grew stronger as she spoke. Steadier, more grounded. As she finished the woman, Emily, reached up to press gentle fingers against my forehead. As her skin brushed against mine she flickered -gone for a heartbeat- and then returned, solid and sharp, like she’d finally been remembered, and was remembering in turn. As she did so I began to \*remember\* as well. I could remember the pride I felt watching my flowers grow. I could remember the brush of Lyle's lips against mine the first time we kissed. I could remember the way I cried, happy tears, when he proposed in the middle of the flower shop.



""Emily Muir,"" I croaked out without understanding why, but knowing it needed to be said, ""You mattered."" 



As I spoke I felt a sensation like burning spreading through my insides, it hurt, god, it hurt like nothing I'd experienced before. But when Emily smiled at me, and gave me the faintest of nods before dissolving, I knew I'd done the right thing. As I heaved in a breath, tightening my grip on Adams hand, another stepped forward.



""My name was Jonathan Reed. I loved to go fishing with my uncle. I read my little sister stories when she went to bed. I died such a long time ago, and no one ever noticed."" 



On it went like that, each person sharing what was left of themselves, the small pieces they clung to. And each piece burned inside me like a brand, etching into me with a permanence it felt like nothing could erase. Slowly, the gathering of people dwindled, each one dissolving as they shared their memory, until only Adam remained.



""I lied, you know. I think my name might have been Michael...or maybe that was just someone I tried to save. If it was, safe to say I failed."" He said with a bitter laugh, ""I remember a brother though, I know that for certain. So much of me has faded, but I remember a brother. Day's spent chasing frogs...coffee that always burned my tongue."" He clasped my shoulder then, squeezing tight and reassuring, ""I've been here a long, long time I think. It'll be nice to finally rest...and remember, you've still got a name. You've still got so many pieces of yourself, and now you have mine as well.""



He faded then, dissolving as the others had before him. I knew, without knowing how, that they hadn't been unmade as the thing had wanted. they'd passed on, in a very literal sense, to a knew place. Somewhere, I hoped, was restful. 



Sinking down into a rickety, plastic seat at the break room table, I remained quiet for a long while. Processing the memories I now held, the pieces of other people that lived in me. Eventually, I drew out my phone, and I began to type. 



That's where I am now, typing out this story for all to see and hear. Don't forget them. Don't forget me. My name is Daniel. I matter. I had a cat. She loved... I can’t remember. But I know she mattered, too. And someday, when the time comes, someone will come to this place afraid and confused, and I'll say to them what Adam said to me 'You got it's attention, didn't you?'.

1jqm1ka,https://i.redd.it/8prv7pt06nse1.png,Baliscon's Friday the 13th - One Long Weekend at Camp Blood,"Original runtime - 6 hours, 8 minutes (Friday the 13th parts 1-4)  
Fanedit runtime - 3 hours, 29 minutes

I find the Friday the 13th series interesting because out of 12 movies, only a couple are what I'd consider to be good.  That's not to say that I don't enjoy the series, no - there's something hypnotic about marathoning these movies, with groups of teens being periodically introduced and summarily picked off before a single survivor encounters an ever-changing Jason Voorhees.  Unlike my approach to the films in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, I wanted to combine separate installments of Friday the 13th in order to highlight the strongest moments from the series and place a stronger focus on Jason's development throughout.  I decided to tackle the first four films in the series since Jason is only a somewhat supernatural killer at this point and not a full-fledged reanimated zombie.  Combining the four films resulted in an original runtime: 6 hours, 8 minutes.  I started by cutting away from any flashbacks that films 2-4 opened with:  
\- Cut 14 minutes from Part 2's opening  
\- Cut 8 minutes from Part 3's opening  
\- Cut 5 minutes from Part 4's opening  
  
That's a total of 27 minutes cut so far, 5 hours 42 minutes remaining  
  
From there I started digging into each individual film.  The first in the series is not a great movie.  Its meager 95 minute runtime is so incredibly padded out by meandering shots and scenes that don't advance the plot.  Worse than that, there's no suspense in the killer's identity, largely because she's not mentioned prior to her appearance on screen, but also because there are no red herrings set up.  Steve is the closest candidate for a possible culprit but is clearly depicted away from the camp while the murders occur.  I worked to omit and rearrange many sequences to help first time viewers question who the killer is, and to improve overall pacing as a whole  
  
From there, here's my change list:  
\- Added a new opening credit after the Paramount logo, along with a title showing a new date for the prologue - I set this during 1971 rather than 1958 in order to help explain Jason's growth from teen to adult between the events of the first and second films   
\- Condensed the murder in the prologue   
\- Added a second new date after the prologue  
\- Cut the hitchhiker from Part 1  
\- Shortened Steve asking for help cutting trees  
\- Cut Ted's drowning prank  
\- Cut the snake-killing scene  
\- Removed the cop's intervention during Steve's breakdown, removing the set up for Crazy Ralph's immediate appearance  
\- Moved the scene with Steve at the diner once strip monopoly is introduced  
\- Cut a strip poker monopoly vignette from before Kevin Bacon's death  
\- Shortened the lead up to Marcie's death  
\- Cut Brenda going to the bathroom after monopoly  
\- Removed scenes with the police officer helping Steve back to camp  
\- Shortened the lead up to Brenda's death  
\- Shortened Alice and Bill's search for their friends  
\- Removed Steve's ride with the cop, which is a shame because it's the only time Friday the 13th is ever mentioned - so I included that bit of dialogue over the opening Paramount logo and credit  
\- Cut Alice making coffee before looking for Bill  
\- Removed Alice barricading the door  
\- Cut Pamela's line, ""What monster could have done this?""  
\- Removed the first and second acts of the conflict between Alice and Pamela  
\- Cut everything once Jason pulls Alice into the water  
  
At this point the edit was 4 hours, 44 minutes long, and I had cut 45 minutes from the first movie alone, which isn't surprising. Now I'm onto Part 2, which is a surprisingly strong entry - it's certainly a better film than its predecessor.  While some segments linger, the overall story is stronger and the characters feel more well-defined.  Ginny is a standout protagonist in the series and her finale against Jason serves as one of the strongest.  
  
Part 2 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- After the opening credits, removed Alice's inclusion entirely  
\- Shortened the truck towing gag  
\- Removed the camp walking right before Muffin wanders off  
\- Cut Terry looking for Muffin  
\- Removed the sequence with Jeff and Sandra wandering off while the others stay at the beach, along with the following sequence of the cop who found them getting killed by Jason  
\- Shortened the section at dinner where Paul tells Jeff and Sandra to stay behind  
\- Removed the first cutaway to the bar once half the group leaves  
\- Cut Vickie's line, ""Wanna toke"" and Jeff playing harmonica afterwards  
\- Cut the fade to white transition after Mark's death  
\- Shortened Jason's ascent up the stairs before killing Jeff and Sandra  
\- Cut the next bar vignette short once Paul and Ginny leave  
\- Removed the rat sequence that causes Ginny to pee under the bed  
\- Shortened Ginny's run to Jason's cabin  
\- Faded to black once Jason jumps through the window, removing the ambulance taking Ginny away, implying that Jason killed her and Paul  
\- Created an effect show the head of Pamela Voorhees opening her eyes  
\- Added the shot of Jason crawling off from the start of Part 3  
  
That amounts to 33 minutes cut with 53 remaining for part two, and the overall edit is 4 hours, 34 minutes at this point.  Unlike the last film, the third is padded out worse than the first two entries, and all for the sake of supporting a 3D gimmick.  I haven't been lucky enough to see the film in its original 3D presentation, but since I haven't, all the shots of objects being held in front of the frame make for a painful watch. On top of that, the protagonist's connection to Jason is tedious at best, and his appearance in a flashback doesn't gel with the progression of his ever-changing appearance.    
  
Part 3 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- After the opening credits, cut the opening scene with Jason killing the couple drying laundry  
\- Shortened Shelly's first prank, eliminating the lines where Chris mentions her past history at the lake  
\- Cut the entire sequence with the group eating all their pot in the van when the police drive by, along with their encounter with not-Ralph  
\- Shortened the conversation Chris has with Rick once he assaults her, removing mention to her history with the camp  
\- Cut the entire gas station sequence with Shelly and the bike gang, along with the preceding scene with Chris and Deb, the 3D yo-yo gag, and the following scene with Chris and Rick  
\- Cut the bikers siphoning gas and getting killed off in the barn  
\- Removed the start of Rick and Chris's heart to heart, along with the start of the 3D juggling gag  
\- Cut Deb and her boyfriend getting undressed before having sex in the hammock, since the last we saw them in the edit, they were only in bathing suits  
\- Removed the fake out sequence with the potheads in the barn  
\- Cut Vera's death scene  
\- Cut Chris looking outside for Rick before finding the dead biker  
\- Cut Chris saying ""You"" when Jason is unmasked  
\- Fade to black after Chris takes Jason out, eliminating the final sequence with Pamela Voorhees  
  
And that brings us to 3 hours, 46 hours for the total edit so far.  Part three resulted in 36 minutes after cutting out 59.  Part 4 is the first movie in the series that I'd call good.  Other than one or two ancillary deaths, the story and characters feel better constructed, much like Part 2, and Jason's conclusion is one of the strongest in the entire series.    
  
Part 4 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- Cut the flashback sequence and opening credits  
\- Shortened the nurse's supply closet scene  
\- Removed the scene of Trish and Mrs. Jarvis running  
\- Cut the hitchhiker scene  
\- Cut Trish saying good night to her mother  
\- Cut Sam and Sara's Strip and Dip gag  
\- Shortened Sam's swim  
\- Cut Mrs. Davis's death  
\- Added a shot of Rob's sister Sandra to help remind the audience which victim she was  
\- Cut Tommy alone at the house when Tish and Rob discuss his backstory  
\- Shortened Jason's final onslaught overall, trimming the padding around each death  
\- Cut Trish talking to the doctor and officer before Tommy comes in  
  
That's 67 minutes left for Part 4 after its original 1 hour, 31 minute runtime.  The edit concludes with 9 minutes worth of end credits that I salvaged from each film, resulting in a total fanedit runtime of 3 hours, 29 minutes after a total 6 hours to edit from.  I'd approach this film as if you were watching an anthology horror movie like Creepshow, only with Jason Voorhees as the constant theme running throughout.  Up next will be Jason's Odyssey, opening with Part 5 and concluding with Jason Goes to Hell.

I've never had a panic attack before.

Last Sunday marked the beginning of what's become a terrifying pattern. I had two cups of Black Rifle coffee that day—one at 8AM, another at noon. While I sometimes have two cups, what followed was entirely new territory for me.

Around 2:30PM, driving home from my son's soccer game with my husband at the wheel, we were having a slightly stressful but normal conversation. Suddenly, I started feeling tingly and disoriented. Every turn felt like the vehicle would tip over despite my husband's careful driving.

What followed was 6+ hours of living hell: gasping for air, pacing the house, nausea, extreme thirst, uncontrollable trembling, and impulsive movements. I was overwhelmed by the sensation that I would pass out and never wake up again. My husband finally took me to the ER around 5:30PM, where I could barely communicate with staff. Relief only came when they gave me Ativan. We returned home around 8:30PM, where I briefly reassured my kids and mother-in-law before showering and collapsing into bed to sleep off the rest of the panic attack.

The next day (Monday), I had work at my retail job. The ""fear of fear"" was threatening to overwhelm me again. I called my doctor as the ER suggested and thankfully got a same-day appointment. My assistant manager was incredibly understanding, letting me leave with nothing but compassion. I returned to work about an hour later with a follow up in six weeks and prescribed Ativan. Having the medication as a safety net helped me get through my shift. Ironically, running the register and helping customers was therapeutic—keeping my mind occupied.

I felt fine after getting home. Victory, right?

The next day (Tuesday), I made a critical mistake. Wanting to force normalcy, I brewed coffee like nothing had happened. Three sips later, while driving to work after dropping my youngest at school, the dreaded tingling returned. Then chest tightness. Then overwhelming doom.

At work, I immediately dumped my coffee and chugged water. I tried breathing exercises and the 5-1 sensory technique. When my assistant manager asked how I was, all I could manage was a smile and thumbs up. Five minutes before opening, I realized I wasn't getting better. I called him over the intercom, my voice only wavering slightly (small victory). When he arrived, I tried to explain but could only gasp like a landed fish. He understood immediately and sent me to the break room.

I tried calming down without medication but was failing terribly. The assistant manager popped in to drop off my Snapple and water. If he said anything, I couldn't hear/make out the words. I'm guessing what he saw looked bad, because our team lead came in after he left and silently sat nearby, witnessing my neck spasms, limb tremors, and desperate attempts to breathe. He watched my violently shaking hands struggle to take a single pill with water. When I could finally speak, I apologized for the humiliating display and for disrupting work. His response: ""You don't have to be sorry. We just want to see that you're okay."" He stayed with me for 40 minutes until my husband arrived, sharing his own experiences with panic attacks and coping techniques. Although I felt terrible about what he witnessed and how it affected work, I was grateful for his understanding.

Since Sunday, I've had a panic attack every morning. Yesterday at work (no caffeine), I took the pill at the first sign of trouble. I suffered silently for about 30 minutes while mechanically stickering candy until it passed. Again, customer interactions surprisingly helped, which is ironic given my history of social anxiety.

This morning I'm home and managed to talk myself down from an oncoming attack.

I have tomorrow and the weekend off, which hopefully gives my system time to reset—if that's how this works. But if this pattern continues where every morning brings an episode of varying intensity, I don't know what I'll do. I primarily run the front as a cashier and don't have the freedom to walk away like our stock employees. Calling for backup takes time from their duties. I can't go home every time, and waiting in the break room until it passes could take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. In six weeks I see my doctor again, and we'll decide if I should go back on Lexapro. (Most likely, and most likely sooner.)

These panic attacks are completely new to me, so please excuse my ignorance. I understand they affect everyone differently—some people recover after one episode, while others develop ongoing disorders.

I'm ready to give up caffeine completely, but in this economy, I can't afford to lose my job.",2,1743695505.0,PanicAttack,2,1.0,False
1jqm14p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqm14p,"Tea-side.com: 20% discount on newly arrived tea 2024 Gui Fei Dark Roasted. Until April 9, no coupon needed.","We covered the classics last time, now for something unusual. Presenting our newly arrived [well-roasted Gui Fei](https://tea-side.com/gui-fei-dark-roasted-oolong-tea/).

Despite the fact that deep roasting is nothing new—Lao Cha Wangs, Dong Dings, or Wuyi oolongs—Gui Fei of such processing is a rare find in our region, as strong fire is not usually applied to this kind here. And that makes it even more exciting, since it’s been done skillfully and delicately. This is a bold bug-bitten material that has been “polished” with a deep roast.

Tasting notes

The fruity-honeyed note of Gui Fei is clearly present but doesn’t dominate the entire profile as in a classic Gui Fei. Instead, there’s burnt sugar, caramel, and chocolate in the latter half of the taste, followed by a light coffee note and an unexpectedly bright floral finish. This tea drinks like a fine cognac or brandy and would likely pair well with them.

At the beginning of my tea journey, I didn’t have much appreciation for deep roasting—I simply didn’t understand it. But at some point, I saw its beauty, felt it, and grew to love its cognac-like elegance.

Deep roasting is a true art. The tea master has to push boldly to the right level and stop at just the right moment. Few can roast with such precision, ensuring the tea doesn’t end up tasting like “burnt sunflower seeds” or “pickled cucumbers.”

What’s more, the roasting in initial processing is not linear but rather follow a spiral: roast, roll, unroll, roast again with different parameters. Lao Cha Wang oolongs, of course, are baked after they’ve been fully processed, while [this tea is still young](https://tea-side.com/gui-fei-dark-roasted-oolong-tea/). 

Here, the high fire slightly mutes the fruitiness and gives this tea a cognac-like elegance—you can still sense the grape notes, but far less than in grape juice. But who would trade a fine glass of cognac for a glass of juice?

This tea should age beautifully, gradually shifting toward a Lao Cha Wang profile even without additional roasting. The fire will slowly fade, giving way to chocolate tones and pastry-like richness.",1,1743695505.0,teasales,0,1.0,False
1jqm0w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jqm0w9/should_i_open_a_0_apr_credit_card_and_transfer_my/,Should I open a 0% APR credit card and transfer my credit card debt?,"Hi, 26F here with a little less than $7,000 in credit card debt. (Please don’t say I shouldn’t have gotten myself into CC debt because I am well aware of this) I have a plan, but before I put it into action I would like to know if it’s a sound plan.

I take home $4,800 a month after taxes, and work at a restaurant on the weekends which brings in roughly $800 extra a month, which I usually keep in cash for emergencies and coffee and deposit a bit if my checking gets low. I had $2,000 in savings but had to take out $1,700 recently to pay for mechanic bills.

My bills (rent, electricity, water, wifi, student loan, car insurance, car note, tv scrips, and gym) come out to $2,500 a month. So, excluding my cash from the restaurant, I’m left with $2,300 a month. This may seem like a lot, but after groceries, gas, credit card bill, and life in general, I’m not left with much in my checking at the end of the month. I also pay a lot for my hobbies and extracurriculars which I’m okay with because they keep me happy, and I recently moved into a new place and have been spending some extra on furniture.

I’m currently paying around $1,000 a month towards my credit card, with a $100-150 interest charge monthly when my balance is anywhere from 5.5-7k. This past month, I didn’t make any charges on my credit card and I reconfigured my whole budget, only paying about $700 on my card so I could put some money back in my savings. 

It seems like there’s no end in sight with my credit card, I feel like I’m barely chipping away. Although I do put a good amount of money towards my balance each month, I’m left with less in my checking and end up living month to month off my paycheck. Then I run the risk of having to put charges on my CC again.

I’m thinking of transferring my balance to a credit card with 0% APR for 21 months with a 5% balance transfer fee. There are other cards with lower balance transfer fees, and one specifically that I can apply for with a free balance transfer fee, but the first card I mentioned may be easier because I’m already pre approved and won’t have to go through the whole process. 

If I did this, I would pay $350 a month for 21 months ((7,000 balance + 350 fee)/21) and have the debt paid off. I can live with just my take home each month without needing to charge to a CC and I can put some money in savings.

Is this a good plan? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the CC debt off faster after transferring it to a new card? I can always pay a higher monthly payment towards the new card, since I think there is some wiggle room in my budget. Another option is to find a card with a cheaper transfer balance fee with 12 months 0APR for example, but my monthly payments would be a bit higher to pay it off in 12 months and I’d be putting a bit less in my savings. Also, the cash I take home, should I be keeping it in my little drawer at home for emergencies or fun spending, or should I be depositing and paying straight to my CC balance?

I started Wegovy last June and was doing fine with it. Since October (when I started 1.7 mg) I have lost around 30 lbs (yay!). I had very few side effects and stayed on 1.7 for an extra month because it was working. In December I began 2.4 and on my third dose I began experiencing terrible nausea/diarrhea/vomiting. It subsided after a few days, and then it began happening once a month (with nausea/diarrhea that lasts 24-72 hrs after injection). Sometimes I go weeks without issues, but the past three weeks it has been consistent. I have also missed my period (which has never happened in my life), I’ve taken pregnancy tests to confirm that my symptoms are not related to pregnancy, but I’m definitely not pregnant. I’m eating healthy meals, and trying smaller and more frequent meals, and I only drink water, 1-2 cups of coffee/day, and herbal tea. I’m using ginger gravol and immodium to try and manage the symptoms.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have found wegovy life changing and hate the idea that it may not be a fit for me. I’ve thought about maybe reducing my dose back to 1.7 to see if that helps? 

I would appreciate any advice or stories from people who have experienced something similar.

1jqlzpm,https://i.redd.it/pro574l85nse1.png,Baliscon's Friday the 13th - One Long Weekend at Camp Blood,"Original runtime - 6 hours, 8 minutes (Friday the 13th parts 1-4)  
Fanedit runtime - 3 hours, 29 minutes

I find the Friday the 13th series interesting because out of 12 movies, only a couple are what I'd consider to be good.  That's not to say that I don't enjoy the series, no - there's something hypnotic about marathoning these movies, with groups of teens being periodically introduced and summarily picked off before a single survivor encounters an ever-changing Jason Voorhees.  Unlike my approach to the films in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, I wanted to combine separate installments of Friday the 13th in order to highlight the strongest moments from the series and place a stronger focus on Jason's development throughout.  I decided to tackle the first four films in the series since Jason is only a somewhat supernatural killer at this point and not a full-fledged reanimated zombie.  Combining the four films resulted in an original runtime: 6 hours, 8 minutes.  I started by cutting away from any flashbacks that films 2-4 opened with:  
\- Cut 14 minutes from Part 2's opening  
\- Cut 8 minutes from Part 3's opening  
\- Cut 5 minutes from Part 4's opening  
  
That's a total of 27 minutes cut so far, 5 hours 42 minutes remaining  
  
From there I started digging into each individual film.  The first in the series is not a great movie.  Its meager 95 minute runtime is so incredibly padded out by meandering shots and scenes that don't advance the plot.  Worse than that, there's no suspense in the killer's identity, largely because she's not mentioned prior to her appearance on screen, but also because there are no red herrings set up.  Steve is the closest candidate for a possible culprit but is clearly depicted away from the camp while the murders occur.  I worked to omit and rearrange many sequences to help first time viewers question who the killer is, and to improve overall pacing as a whole  
  
From there, here's my change list:  
\- Added a new opening credit after the Paramount logo, along with a title showing a new date for the prologue - I set this during 1971 rather than 1958 in order to help explain Jason's growth from teen to adult between the events of the first and second films   
\- Condensed the murder in the prologue   
\- Added a second new date after the prologue  
\- Cut the hitchhiker from Part 1  
\- Shortened Steve asking for help cutting trees  
\- Cut Ted's drowning prank  
\- Cut the snake-killing scene  
\- Removed the cop's intervention during Steve's breakdown, removing the set up for Crazy Ralph's immediate appearance  
\- Moved the scene with Steve at the diner once strip monopoly is introduced  
\- Cut a strip poker monopoly vignette from before Kevin Bacon's death  
\- Shortened the lead up to Marcie's death  
\- Cut Brenda going to the bathroom after monopoly  
\- Removed scenes with the police officer helping Steve back to camp  
\- Shortened the lead up to Brenda's death  
\- Shortened Alice and Bill's search for their friends  
\- Removed Steve's ride with the cop, which is a shame because it's the only time Friday the 13th is ever mentioned - so I included that bit of dialogue over the opening Paramount logo and credit  
\- Cut Alice making coffee before looking for Bill  
\- Removed Alice barricading the door  
\- Cut Pamela's line, ""What monster could have done this?""  
\- Removed the first and second acts of the conflict between Alice and Pamela  
\- Cut everything once Jason pulls Alice into the water  
  
At this point the edit was 4 hours, 44 minutes long, and I had cut 45 minutes from the first movie alone, which isn't surprising. Now I'm onto Part 2, which is a surprisingly strong entry - it's certainly a better film than its predecessor.  While some segments linger, the overall story is stronger and the characters feel more well-defined.  Ginny is a standout protagonist in the series and her finale against Jason serves as one of the strongest.  
  
Part 2 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- After the opening credits, removed Alice's inclusion entirely  
\- Shortened the truck towing gag  
\- Removed the camp walking right before Muffin wanders off  
\- Cut Terry looking for Muffin  
\- Removed the sequence with Jeff and Sandra wandering off while the others stay at the beach, along with the following sequence of the cop who found them getting killed by Jason  
\- Shortened the section at dinner where Paul tells Jeff and Sandra to stay behind  
\- Removed the first cutaway to the bar once half the group leaves  
\- Cut Vickie's line, ""Wanna toke"" and Jeff playing harmonica afterwards  
\- Cut the fade to white transition after Mark's death  
\- Shortened Jason's ascent up the stairs before killing Jeff and Sandra  
\- Cut the next bar vignette short once Paul and Ginny leave  
\- Removed the rat sequence that causes Ginny to pee under the bed  
\- Shortened Ginny's run to Jason's cabin  
\- Faded to black once Jason jumps through the window, removing the ambulance taking Ginny away, implying that Jason killed her and Paul  
\- Created an effect show the head of Pamela Voorhees opening her eyes  
\- Added the shot of Jason crawling off from the start of Part 3  
  
That amounts to 33 minutes cut with 53 remaining for part two, and the overall edit is 4 hours, 34 minutes at this point.  Unlike the last film, the third is padded out worse than the first two entries, and all for the sake of supporting a 3D gimmick.  I haven't been lucky enough to see the film in its original 3D presentation, but since I haven't, all the shots of objects being held in front of the frame make for a painful watch. On top of that, the protagonist's connection to Jason is tedious at best, and his appearance in a flashback doesn't gel with the progression of his ever-changing appearance.    
  
Part 3 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- After the opening credits, cut the opening scene with Jason killing the couple drying laundry  
\- Shortened Shelly's first prank, eliminating the lines where Chris mentions her past history at the lake  
\- Cut the entire sequence with the group eating all their pot in the van when the police drive by, along with their encounter with not-Ralph  
\- Shortened the conversation Chris has with Rick once he assaults her, removing mention to her history with the camp  
\- Cut the entire gas station sequence with Shelly and the bike gang, along with the preceding scene with Chris and Deb, the 3D yo-yo gag, and the following scene with Chris and Rick  
\- Cut the bikers siphoning gas and getting killed off in the barn  
\- Removed the start of Rick and Chris's heart to heart, along with the start of the 3D juggling gag  
\- Cut Deb and her boyfriend getting undressed before having sex in the hammock, since the last we saw them in the edit, they were only in bathing suits  
\- Removed the fake out sequence with the potheads in the barn  
\- Cut Vera's death scene  
\- Cut Chris looking outside for Rick before finding the dead biker  
\- Cut Chris saying ""You"" when Jason is unmasked  
\- Fade to black after Chris takes Jason out, eliminating the final sequence with Pamela Voorhees  
  
And that brings us to 3 hours, 46 hours for the total edit so far.  Part three resulted in 36 minutes after cutting out 59.  Part 4 is the first movie in the series that I'd call good.  Other than one or two ancillary deaths, the story and characters feel better constructed, much like Part 2, and Jason's conclusion is one of the strongest in the entire series.    
  
Part 4 Change List:  
\- Added a new card showing the date  
\- Cut the flashback sequence and opening credits  
\- Shortened the nurse's supply closet scene  
\- Removed the scene of Trish and Mrs. Jarvis running  
\- Cut the hitchhiker scene  
\- Cut Trish saying good night to her mother  
\- Cut Sam and Sara's Strip and Dip gag  
\- Shortened Sam's swim  
\- Cut Mrs. Davis's death  
\- Added a shot of Rob's sister Sandra to help remind the audience which victim she was  
\- Cut Tommy alone at the house when Tish and Rob discuss his backstory  
\- Shortened Jason's final onslaught overall, trimming the padding around each death  
\- Cut Trish talking to the doctor and officer before Tommy comes in  
  
That's 67 minutes left for Part 4 after its original 1 hour, 31 minute runtime.  The edit concludes with 9 minutes worth of end credits that I salvaged from each film, resulting in a total fanedit runtime of 3 hours, 29 minutes after a total 6 hours to edit from.  I'd approach this film as if you were watching an anthology horror movie like Creepshow, only with Jason Voorhees as the constant theme running throughout.  Up next will be Jason's Odyssey, opening with Part 5 and concluding with Jason Goes to Hell.  
Thank you very much for taking the time to read and watch!

During his stays, he would do shit like move my furniture around, use my playstation without asking and ignoring me while I was there (like not even trying to suggest we play something together, just using my stuff as his own), ordering food for himself and leaving the trash in my apartment, organising parties and never helping with any cleanup after the parties. Stuff that I consider pretty disrespectful. Oh and also very often when I paid for something with the pretext that we're splitting afterwards, he would not pay his part and just shrug it off or ask me if I'm in financial trouble that I'm asking him for money... Also, most of the time he brought along his friend, always asking last moment whether he can come. I tried to confront him about the stuff that bothered me, he was like yeah, yeah, but nothing really changed. Then I discovered that during the last party, either him or his friend went through my freezer and drank about half of a bottle of alcohol I had there without asking or without saying anything. Last time we met, I confronted him about it, once again that using my stuff without asking is a bit off the limits, but he just said it wasn't him, must have been his friend.

Cue to the morning after this confrontation, besides that they ate all the snacks I got myself for breakfast ( we were in the shop together, they could have gotten sth for themselves, but decided not to ) he decided to make coffee. I had about 6 or 8 different packs of coffee, most of them large packs from a local brand, but there was one small colourful pack with the rest of a very special coffee (limited edition, sold out, not possible to buy anymore) that I got as a present. Of course he served himself this precious thing I was keeping for a special occasion. 

When I found out, I was absolutely furious, I totally lost my cool, shouted at him, trying to explain once again that he is not at his place, that he really shouldn't have used that coffee in particular or like to take any of my stuff at all without asking first. He was shrugging it off once again that he didn't do anything and that it's normal to serve himself as a guest. At some point during my shouting, I gave him a light slap, really just a gesture, the way you slap people to wake them up, along with saying something like wake the fuck up, you're not at your place (again, without any force or harm caused). After that, I closed myself in my room, trying to calm down because his responses just kept pissing me off more, but they got the message and left my apartment.

After a month of not speaking, I tried to reach out to him, saying I was sorry for the reaction, but his behaviour was totally out of place. He basically just said that it's unacceptable to be this explosive and to lay your hand on a friend, while repeating that he did nothing wrong, that he wanted to be nice to make morning coffee for everyone and whether I do not know the saying ""make yourself at home"". Also that he is only responsible for himself, not the friend he invited and I should not blame him if his friend served himself my alcohol behind my back.

I think ""make yourself at home"" means rather ""feel free to ask for anything I can do to make you feel comfortable"" rather than literally ""behave like you own this place"". And I do think that you are partly responsible for the actions of people you invite to someone else's place.

**Ever feel like you're racing against the clock, but the clock is winning?** Yeah, me too. A few months ago, I was drowning in obligations, convinced there just weren’t enough hours in the day. But then I stumbled across a game-changing concept that saved me a whopping 15 hours per week. Yep, 15! Want to know the secret? It's the magical combo of **daily rituals** and **time blocking**. 🎉    

Now, before you roll your eyes and think, ""Oh great, another productivity hack,"" hear me out. I was skeptical too. But once I figured out how these two strategies suit different vibes of my day, it was like finding cheat codes to life. 😎    

**Here's how it panned out:**  

- **Daily Rituals:** Think of these as those cozy habits that bring your day some rhythm and calm. For me, it’s sipping coffee (ahhh ☕️) while jotting down a ‘win’ from yesterday. Keeps my spirits high and motivates me to kickstart the day on a positive note.  
   
- **Time Blocking:** This one's the Batman to my Robin. Every evening, I'd map out the next day into chunks (or blocks). **Spoiler alert:** It's not as rigid as it sounds. It’s more like penciling in an ""appointment"" for deep work or even my Netflix binge. Yeah, balance! 😄  

Wondering how to kick off your own routine without becoming obsessive? **Start small.** Seriously. Choosing just one daily ritual, like a 5-minute morning meditation or that delightful cup of coffee contemplation, can make a world of difference. And, for time blocking, maybe just block out the first hour of your workday for focused tasks.    

**Real talk:** It’s about finding what fits into your groove without creating more stress. Some days I nail it, other days, well, I’m human. 🤷‍♂️ The key is not to beat myself up when things don't go as planned.   

And get this, once these little rituals become as natural as breathing, you'll be amazed at how much smoother your day flows. It's like a secret handshake with Father Time! ✨    

So, my fellow time-travelers, does your day flow like an endless ocean of tasks or like a gentle, manageable stream? Let’s chat about what’s working (or not) for you. Or if you're ready to shake things up, join me in redefining how we dance with time. 🌊🕺",1,1743695129.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

The taste of coffee feels as if I'm licking wood, and the aftertaste of it is even worse than that, it's feels like something burnt in my mouth, I only drink coffee when I want to avoid drinking energy drinks which are not healthy and I'm trying to limit generally, coffee is just a healthier option that's the only positive about it and it still depends.

And even as a pre workout it's overrated asf not only as it's taste, I've tried drinking coffee before training and I barely felt better or stronger or whatever, people told me it's the best pre workout which I don't get the hype around it there are literally so many better pre workouts again the only thing coffee does better here is being healthier.

It's not that I want to vomit when I drink coffee, but it's kind of getting there, and regardless of what coffee it is that's what it seems to me like, cold, hot, sweet, without sugar, machiatto, cappuccino, espresso, Starbucks it's all the same I've asked people what do they like about it and the fact that people tell me they enjoy it boggles me.",0,1743695002.0,unpopularopinion,30,0.5,False

At this time no cars are around in the neighborhood and I hadn’t seen a soul that early, all week. I see headlights and immediately turn my brights off and as the car passes me I see that it’s an MP. Then I see him turn around and I am like no way am I going to get pulled over. He follows me to my job and as I pull into a parking spot he turns his lights on.

It’s the same choice I’ve had every day since I turned 21, yet I keep making the same decision. I’m 30 now. Almost ten years of drinking. Almost ten years of poisoning my body. It started as a way to feel ***more*** \- more social, more creative, more fun. Somewhere along the way, I’ve found myself drinking to feel ***less*** \- less pain, less grief, less pressure, less dysregulation. 

It’s not too hard to see where this could go from here. If I get lucky, and things don’t get worse, life will go on as it’s been - waking up every few days feeling the effects of the night before. The poor sleep, the waking up in a panic, the feeling of my heart beating just a little too hard and fast, the dizziness and headache, the discomfort and gurgle in my gut. I have no choice but to start the day, saying a silent prayer that Advil, coffee, and a shot of Pepto will save me. Maybe I learn my lesson for the next day or two and abstain completely, then I get confident that I can handle a beer or two or splitting a bottle of wine. Fast forward another week or two and I’m back where I was when this story started, waking up full of shame and a desire to never make myself feel like this again. The cycle repeats. Over and over again, forever. And that’s the best possible outcome. 

If I’m less lucky, it gets worse and escalates over time. Perhaps it’s a daily drink, or three. Perhaps it starts earlier in the day. Maybe I start feeling the need to sneak booze or stash bottles. Hell, I already do that sometimes. Maybe my body stops whispering and finally starts screaming at me to stop. It could be a liver or kidney issue, it could be my blood pressure or something with my heart, maybe it’s cancer, my greatest fear. Of course, most of these illnesses can’t be tied directly back to alcohol, but it doesn’t take a genius to know that poisoning your body every few days for ten, twenty, thirty years will catch up with you eventually. Maybe some day I make a choice I can’t take back; I get behind the wheel of my car thinking I’m okay. Hell, I’m sure I’ve driven when I shouldn't have. But maybe this is the time I don’t get home safely. Maybe I get arrested and slapped with a fancy new DUI. Maybe it’s much worse, and I hurt myself or someone else.

There’s no reason this wouldn’t be my path. I’m not special. I’m not stronger than the generations of alcoholics that came before me.

by Preston Dennett

A face-to-face confrontation with an extraterrestrial humanoid – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. It happens to a lot of people all over the world, and has been going on for a very long time. While many of our governments are now saying that UFOs are real, they still are saying nothing about firsthand humanoid contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? Is it because these cases prove that we are not alone? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids of all kinds. These include multiple witness cases, some with compelling physical evidence pointing towards the reality of the experience. Now is the time for truth and transparency with this subject!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was watching his sheep-herd in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Without warning, all his sheep scattered, and a large saucer-shaped craft landed in the field next to him. Ernst watched it for several moments, and when nothing happened, he approached it, then reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids in jumpsuits and helmets. The beings spoke a strange language then returned into their craft which took off. Afterward, Ernst found burned patches of ground where the craft had rested.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railroad worker Georges Godbout and two others were working on the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a top-shaped metallic craft appeared over the tracks. It moved towards them, stopped andthen  a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out from beneath it. He started to look around, but spotting the witnesses, it quickly climbed back into the craft. As the UFO moved off, it made such a loud noise that the three men became physically ill and had to stop work for the day.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, eleven-year-old Anssi Hakala had attended a cousin’s birthday party, and was bicycling along a forested road back to his home in rural Marttila, Finland. Suddenly a tall greenish humanoid figure appeared, floating above his head. And following him. Anssi biked away in fear. The being quickly disappeared into a craft, and the craft now began to pace Anssi on his bike. As it hovered over Anssi’s head, it sprayed him with a weird liquid which caused a tickling sensation. Anssi returned home nearly frantic with fear.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) went out to the rural area near his home in Bedarrides, France to pick some edible mushroom near his home. Bending down to pick some mushrooms, he observed what first believed to be two small children. But he changed his mind when he saw that they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted silently away. Skeptical of UFOs, Antoine wondered if they might have been Chinese spies.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of children from a youth camp by Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia noticed a silver flying saucer hovering at treetop level. Lights blinked around the perimeter. A light flashed on the bottom of the craft, and also on the top of the dome. There were several portholes around the edge, and through one of the portholes, the kids saw a strange humanoid with a very large head looking down at them. The craft accelerated rapidly away and was gone.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (two eleven-year-old deaf boys) were walking up to the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway. Simultaneously they both noticed a glowing orange object just above the nearby treeline. Seconds later, it glided towards them, stopped, and landed a short distance away. They could now see a weird humanoid looking out at them from one of the portholes The craft took off, leaving behind unmistakable landing traces in the field.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10:00 pm on the night of August 31, 1978, at the same time as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias were amazed to see a solid, oval-shaped craft with portholes hovering near their farm. After moving around the area, it then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who floated a few inches above the ground, approaching the farm. The two figures circled around their sheds, seeming to inspect the farm. They remained on the property for nearly an hour before finally leaving. It was one of more than twenty encounters in the area both before and after this event.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an unnamed boy was walking through a construction site near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the landscape around him lit up like daylight. As the light faded, he saw a craft sitting on a hill a short distance away. On top of it stood a strange humanoid figure. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He ran, tripped and fainted. When he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He jumped up and tried to fight them, but fainted again. When he awoke, they were gone. He noticed that the house next door had lost power.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund sat in the kitchen of his home in Daviken, Sweden drinking coffee, when he noticed a very weird-looking, short figure in his yard. The figure stood with legs spread wide and arms outstretched. It wore a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate this strange figure, Rune watched as it disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer was stopped in his car as a UFO flew over him not far away and on the same night. Also, one year earlier, Rune’s neighbor said that he observed a short humanoid outside his home, which also disappeared into thin air.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 and a fourteen-year-old girl was in the second story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Suddenly, sheard a deafening screeching noise right outside her window. Looking outside, she saw a very weird-looking, three-foot-tall creature with grayish skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, ran into the bedroom, and saw the creature. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how truly strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts are only a tiny portion of the huge number of documented cases on record. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are not alone!

So of course my anxious ass had to ask for her number before she left. And I've only met her twice irl, just to add on.

Only problem is that I've never had the upper hand in social situations :/ I've been working on my charisma and overall being less dense, but I'm not where I need to be either. Should there be any awkward silence, I'm bringing a strategy game just in case.

But what do I do to carry the conversation? I def don't initiate conversation unless I'm already close to the person. Which I'm obviously not in this case. And unless she turns out to be a yapper, I'll be responsible for maintaining the peace bc \*I\* went out of my way to set this up. Yk? I can't just expect her to carry the conversation, that'd be fcking rude.

I've considered playing 20 questions with her, or literally asking her 20 questions like ""if you could live anywhere, where would it be"". And hopefully one of those questions could spark an intellectual conversation. For context I like down-to-earth things, especially deep conversations, and I'm thinking she might be the same way. My problem is that I'd have to write the questions down and bring them with me because I have the memory of a goldfish, and I'm concerned it might rube her the wrong way.

Also, I hardly wear the shirts bcos GOD FORBID I spill coffee or something and regret it the rest of my life. 
Thank you kindly!


•I’ll hand wash w/ cold water- I have a detergent for babies, assuming it’s the most gentle. I have a feeling when I hand wash I tend to use too much detergent- what amount would you recommend for around 3 shirts at a time? Also, should I wash inside out? Does that make a difference?

•When I rinse, I run the item through cold water, never wringing it. Then rinse the basin then fill it back up w cold water and let it sit abt 15-20 mins, then come back and rinse once more. I don’t know if the sitting helps? But since I’ve started doing that, clothing doesn’t end up with that stiff feel 

• To get the water out I kind of press and fold press and fold until most water is out- anyone have something that works better? I have a drying rack also

• I have an oxyclean dark color booster- would you “risk” using it? I believe all of the shirts are either fully cotton or extremely high percentage (90%+). Where do you draw the line w dark clothing in terms of separation- I have a medium tone, earthy red one- I guess I wouldn’t use it for that? But then I also have a blue one that is a few shades lighter than navy. Would you use it then? Or again just never at all 

• I don’t have any items off the top of my head that require stain removal. I typically use *Shout* set in stain removal. It has removed everything I’ve ever applied it to without any issues, for anyone interested. Never used it on a vintage tee bcos I have the fear of God in me for the slightest thing happening to them. But if there are some tried and true methods enthusiasts use for general stain removal, I would love to know!

• That being said- I recently acquired a very prized (for me personally) vintage tee that has a faint spot. I can tell it is oil based. Shout also has a remover for oil based marks- does anyone have experience w this?

• I am just hanging them in my closet- but since I don’t wear often- should I get maybe a breathable garment bag? This is intense I know lol

I was in the middle of college, supposedly “the best years of my life” and I couldn’t bring myself to train, eat clean, or focus consistently.

I’d have good days, then fall off for a week. Wake up groggy. Caffeine crash. Rinse and repeat.

Eventually after experiementing with a ton I found system that helped my brain and body feel ready to go every day. The key was finding the right ingredients, from high quality sources, and the actual right dosages. This was the most important and difficult part and I think its overlooked a lot.

My favorites:

* **Creatine (5g/day):** Solid cognitive and recovery benefits
* **Adaptogens (Lion’s Mane, Rhodiola, Cordyceps):** Subtle at first, but over time they really help with mental clarity and stress resilience
* **Green tea caffeine + L-theanine:** Cleaner energy, less jittery than coffee, no crash

I’ve been taking this combo for a few months now and honestly it’s the first time I’ve felt locked in day after day. I recently noticed there’s actually a brand trying to combine these into one system, which is interesting—I’ve been mixing it myself until now.

1jqliw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightgain/comments/1jqliw1/how_i_got_my_appetite_back_in_over_a_week/,How I got my appetite back in over a week,"Hey I hope this can help some people. I lost a lot of weight due to depression and because of that it messed up my appetite so bad I was only eating one meal a day. It got to the point when I wanted to fix it, it was too much because I would get sick or feel full after a couple of bites. So I tried some tips and tricks to help me.

1. Protein shakes. I liked the Boost shakes meant for seniors to gain/maintain weight even though I'm 29. Never got any weird looks or glances when getting them. But either way, if they were less than 300 calories they were not worth it for me, including the ones I made at home as premade Boost shakes get expensive. If I couldn't finish a meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) I would have one of the shakes. The trick is to have them after you've already eaten, as while liquid calories help a lot, we need solid foods to gain weight too. And it was making up for the calories that I could not eat as it was easier to have liquid calories. I think this also helped stretch out my stomach more, as over time I was able to eat more during my meals and quickly did not need the protein shakes as much. My general advice is to never try a protein shake as a 'meal replacement' as it will make you feel full, thus you won't eat as much. Even if you can only handle a couple bites of food, you are doing great and trust the process.
2. Eat every 4 hours. At least. The average person eats about every 2-3 hours. I have ADHD and all my life even as a small child I struggled with being under weight because I honestly 'forget to eat'. It is very hard to describe but I can get so focused in my hyper fixations for the day that I don't even realize that 5-7 hours have passed. So I have set up a timer for every 4 hours, reminding me to eat, starting after my first meal of the day. I hardly get hungry in the morning ever since I was a kid, but I try to eat something within 2 hours of waking up. If I am hungry before my timer goes off, I just eat anyways and do not reset the timer. Over a week I noticed I was naturally getting hungry again every 2 hours, which was a huge improvement for me.
3. I like black coffee and don't like sugar bombs in my coffee, but if you like black coffee/tea like me and don't get as hungry in the morning, try adding a tablespoon of honey to every cup. It's a good way to add about 60 calories per cup if you aren't already adding creamer/milk to it. I also sometimes make a cold brew shake with protein powder if I'm in a rush. My favorite foods that you can add to basically anything and calorie dense, are chia seeds, honey, butter, and olive oil.

This also helped me from relapsing as much, as there was times I got stressed out and felt terrible for losing weight and my appetite again after some dental work made me eat mostly liquids, no sugar, and soft foods again for 10 days. But then I went back to these two steps and it came back again within a week.

Feel free to comment your own tips and tricks as well.

Edit: Oh also forgot, try more water. Ideally, after you've eaten a big meal. Not only does it help with hydration and digestion, it can rule out other drinks that are killing your appetite with things like caffeine, alcohol, sugar, artificial sugar, and aspartame.

1jqlfxd,https://v.redd.it/jgxdoqfu1nse1,Issue maintaining pressure during shot [Breville BES820xl],"Recently got a used Breville BES820xl, changed the gasket to proper 51mm size and descaled with water/vinegar solution. Yet I continue to see this problem where coffee and water sprays out as pressure starts to build (sometimes with a more pronounced “sneeze” than in this video). I don’t think the issue is with grind size, as (1) same grind size works fine on my separate BBE and (2) when I go coarser to avoid this, my shot runs very fast (<20 seconds to get to 1:2 ratio). In this example, I used 16g of coffee, but I’ve tried with more and with less and get same results. The puck is very wet after, usually with some standing water on top. 

I’m wondering if (a) the seal between the portafilter and gasket is not tight enough, (b) there’s some problem with pressure creation/release in the machine, or (c) something else entirely?

Any suggestions as to what is happening and how to fix it are greatly appreciated. Thanks!

There are problems with still using gold as a measurement of value due to gold no longer being as scarce as it was when humanity were limited to Earth, but I don’t know how else to proceed. If on average a ton of gold is worth 55,000 credits. This would make 55,000 credits worth about $100million today. An average drink today in America costs let’s say $2, converting this to credits would make a drink cost 55,000/50million = 0.0011 credits. 

This feels like an extremely crude method of translating costs between commodities today and in Elite Dangerous. The economy of a spacefaring humanity would drastically alter the value of things in ways  that at least I’m not able to anticipate. 

Does anyone have any ideas for working out how many credits a coffee at the space station would cost in Elite? I’d be intrigued to know how much and also just generally considering how the economy in Elite would realistically work. Maybe there are monetary units below credits particular to different systems maybe that deal with lower values or something like that.

1jqlatk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1jqlatk/bpd_ruined_my_relationship/,BPD ruined my relationship,"Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that causes instability in moods, behaviour and relationships. In this post I'd like to share my personal experience about dating someone with BPD. There are certain characteristics of BPD that I will highlight as I go along. My aim is not to offend anyone, only to tell my experience.

I'm going to start with some of my personal background. I was engaged to a woman I had been with for 10 years, unfortunately over time the relationship had become stagnant and neither of us were happy, and after some counselling we parted on mutual terms. However, we kept a healthy friendship afterwards. Over the last few years of this relationship, we both started seeing other people as she landed a job which required her to live away from home. Because of this we agreed to an open relationship - this is when I met the girl with BPD. 

This girl was nice, quite pretty and when we started talking it was as if we had known each other for years, we hooked up then that was it, she disappeared for a year, so I saw other people. A year later, she reappears and we get back to talking and we met up again. We both shared our current situations, I was now single and didn't want to commit to a full relationship and I was still seeing other people. 

(At this point I was completely broken from splitting up with my ex, especially when I saw her for the last time just before I moved out of our home. I needed time to heal, and I slept with many people as a way to cope).

She told me she had met another guy and was dating him, which I was cool with. We spent time together I'd see her after work, or she'd come over, it was a nice familiar feeling. (I am still unaware that she has BPD at this point). She reveals that she overdosed on ketamine as a result of being dumped by another guy she had been seeing because he was ""abusive"" and she had started seeing another guy who was in a poly relationship. In hindsight, this should have been the point where I walked away, this was a girl who was into drugs and I'm not.

When I found a new place to live, the BPD girl actually helped me and my mother move my stuff, however; she decided (unbeknownst to me) as I was moving into my new home, she was also moving in. Now I had signed a lease agreement that stated that it was me and me alone moving in and paying rent and she knew this. (She never paid any rent).

So a few weeks go by, and we both agreed that she'd come over a few times a week. I had arranged to meet/see people on some days, because I wanted ""live life"" a little bit and I didn't want a full relationship because I wasn't ready. On other days I wanted some me time because I have a lot of hobbies.

This girl did not go home. She didn't want to go because she didn't trust me, so I had to basically force her to go so I could have some space. To remedy this she told me if we were to be in an official 'open' relationship, she would be able to trust me, if not she wasn't going to wait around for me and I would lose her. So to make her happy; I agreed, which was to be the biggest mistake of my life. (She had told her friends and family that we were already in one prior to this). (Making out to others they are ""better"" and don't need help is another sign of BPD).

I had set some very rigid ground rules, the biggest thing that she must never do, is contact any of the other people I was seeing (I put this rule in place to prevent any drama between these people, they all knew I was seeing other people but didn't care to know who). Not only that but never to message my ex fiance.

She told that was fine as long as I told her who I was seeing, which I agreed too. Not long after this she started doing awful things that prevented me from leaving her out of fear she'd do something lethal. She would self harm (with stolen Stanley knife blades), pretend to go into trance like states called ""disassociation"" collapse on the floor and become aggressive. I had no idea what to do and I was scared I had never experienced anything like this before. This is when I found out she had BPD. A condition I had never heard of.

**Now I know that this is a manipulation tactic typically used by BPD affected people, to isolate and entrap their partners because they often have abandonment issues or other trauma, which spiral out of control when they feel uneasy or paranoid. And she faked/weaponized it a lot of it to get what she wanted.**

She became so paranoid and so distrustful, that she broke the very rules we had put in place, thus starting drama. She started messaging a couple of people I had been seeing that I was cheating on her, so she'd look like a victim. Then asked to meet up, so she could hook up with them. (Jealouy is another BPD trait) After a while SHE decided I was not allowed to see anyone, but she could, so we stopped having an open relationship.

I started to feel trapped at this point, I never wanted this, and her paranoia grew by the day and she broke my biggest rule - messaged my ex fiance. She apologised to her for how awful of a person I was, all in a ploy to gain sympathy and an ""ally"" an attempt to control everything in my life. I warned her months prior that my ex would not appreciate this, and I was right: my ex told her to ""fuck off"" and never speak to her. In floods tears, she calls me, begging for forgiveness after it didn't go the way she wanted, I laughed at her, but stupidly forgave her. I should have walked away here.

I gave this girl WAY too many chances! I began to realise how delusional she was, she was obsessed with 'the honeymoon phase' and how she never wanted it to end, which for every relationship it does, but the parts afterwards are better. I told her, if you don't trust me why are you still here? She responded ""I like the idea of you"", this hurt a lot, she didn't want me, she wanted this made up version of me from her own head!

Week by week she grew more and more paranoid, she began messaging my friends and family a load of personal things so she could look like a victim. Sadly, through her I lost a lot of friendships, including my ex who I had known for 11 years. Fortunately my family started to realise what was happening, especially my mother and were on my side, which she did NOT like. 

To gain more control she forced me to give her the names of the ALL people I had ever seen so she could tell them all how evil I am. (Another trait of BPD is that if you do something wrong - you are evil, there are no grey areas) She even posted my photos on a private Facebook page to get people to message her. (I had stopped seeing these people months prior). 

One of the worst days was when we went away for a day trip and fought the entire time, because I asked if I could meet up with a friend for coffee the next morning. For the entre day she was ballistic, screaming at me in the street which was so embarrassing. When things had finally calmed down, she it kicked off when we got home. This was the first time I completely lost it at her. I am not an aggressive guy and I absolutely hate confrontation but if I'm pushed around too much I lash out. I felt awful screaming at her, but it also felt good to finally share out loud how I really felt, there was so much pent up frustration and resentment that built up over 11 months. Afterwards she told everyone that I verbally abuse and play mind games with her on a daily basis.

I had had enough by this point and in order to gain a little bit of control in my life I went behind her back and cheated on her, I felt terrible because I knew that it was wrong, but I needed freedom. I felt like she had taken it all away.

By the end of the relationship I had no friends, I was not allowed to go anywhere, do any of my hobbies or text anyone without her consent, she'd go through my phone when I was asleep, she called my work to make sure I was there, and she brought more and more of her stuff over to my place which was already cramped. It was suffocating and I felt like a prisoner in my own home. Not only that but she convinced me that I wasn't good enough and she was the only one who would tolerate someone like me, (""I'm your angel"" she'd say) and made out I had mental issues myself, she even made go to a sexaholics anonymous.

When she found out that I cheated on her, she came into my work and ended things in front of all my colleagues. As humiliating as it was, it was honestly the best thing that could have happened, people saw her for what she was, an attention seeking abuser. I wasn't able to end things prior because she wouldn't allow it. She'd threaten me with slander or self harm. 

After a while I found out that all of her past relationships ended the same way, isolating her partners and mentally abusing them, just like me. If there was a word to describe her, I'd say 'Succubus' her entire nice personality is a facade. She is an abuser. I was in an abusive relationship.

To conclude; I'm not a saint and I'm not looking for sympathy. I never wanted this relationship, and I was made to believe I had no choice. You do have a choice, you must choose your own happiness before anyone else. I wanted to share my experience in dealing with someone who has BPD, I know that somewhere someone out there has had a similar experience to me and I want you to know that you're not alone and if you want to walk away - you can and should. 

There was a LOT more that happened than what's written (like how she wanted couples counseling 3 months into the relationship, her getting actual counselling for her personal trauma, not taking her medication because she didn't think she needed it anymore, ect) but I purely wanted to share my experience with anyone willing to read.

Where should I stay ; Tam Coc (as it has more restaurants) or Trang An? I also read that most people prefer the Trang An boat tour - route 3. What do you think?

Here is what I am thinking - let me know your thoughts: 

* **17/4**: Arrive at 20pm, go to accommodation, relax (anything to do in the night?)
* **18/4**: Grab to Trang An boat tour, do the tour route 3, visit also the Bai Dinh Pagoda. In the afternoon, climb Mua Cave (Hang Mua).
* **19/4:** Tam Coc boat tour (does it worth it?), or bike ride around Tam Coc rice paddie, visit Bich Dong Pagoda, duck leader (perhaps?). In the evening go to take the sleeper bus. 

Also, can you do any water activities there? Anything like ziplining or more adventurous? 

And any recommendations for accommodation or places for food/coffee?

I'm a 24-year-old Chinese guy looking to make new friends and maybe hang out weekly. I found this nice café along Del Monte, QC, and thought it’d be cool to meet some fellow Chinese peeps around the area.

Not rich, not poor—just cruising through life, so don’t hit me with the “all Chinese are rich” stereotype lol. But I am interested in connecting with fellow business owners too! Would be nice to have a circle where we can chat, exchange ideas, and help each other grow.

Someone once said, “Surround yourself with only people who will lift you higher.” (No clue who, but it sounds solid, and I’m down for that vibe.)

If you’re in QC and looking for new connections, hit me up! Let’s grab coffee and see where things go. 😃

1jql9ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jql9ik/psa_exercise_helps_a_lot/,PSA: Exercise helps a lot,"I want to share something that has been helping me a lot recently: exercise. 

I was extremely sedentary during the final year of my relationship with my ex. My ex came to me and told me that he wanted couple’s counseling because he wanted to try fixing some conflict. I was happy to do it, but it also scared me because I realized that if my ex is trying to seek counseling as a couple, then he’s having doubts. 

I was so anxious, so worried, so depressed about the current state of my relationship, that it got into my mind that my ex was going to breakup with me if I wasn’t improving, if I wasn’t being a better me. And that pressure, that intensity, it bedded me. I couldn’t get out of bed some days because of how much anxiety I felt. 

My ex boyfriend would go to a volleyball meetup and would invite me all the time. I told him that I just needed sleep, but deep down, I was scared. I was mentally preparing myself for therapy because therapy was always right after volleyball and I was so scared. During the breakup, he told me that now I’m going back to volleyball again and why didn’t I do it when I was still in the relationship? Deep down, it was because I was so nervous of therapy. I was so nervous of screwing up. It messed with me royally. 

Therapy sessions were a mix. We argued a lot. We got some useful tools, but I kept telling my boyfriend over and over again that all I really needed from him was reassurance. Was to be told that I was loved. To be told that I was handsome. Or to get peptalks. To be able to get opportunities from him that he was still here and that he wants to be here, not that he’s frustrated. 

I never really got that. He got distant. He waited until therapy to argue with me. It was a slow dim. He was so withdrawn. Therapy felt more like a crutch than an actual solution. During this time, I also gained a lot of weight. Belly weight, arm fat, I grew two pants sizes up. I was tired all the time. Moody. Depressed. I would drive to gas stations and get a medley of candy like twix, skittles, lifesaver gummies, 100 grand bars, chocolate milk, M&Ms and just eat all of it in my car before going to hang out with my ex. Sometimes I would go and get chocolate shakes, whatever the largest size was and drink it at night on the way home from my ex if he didn't want me to sleep over. I would raid my pantry and just snack at 2 AM. I was insanely unhealthy.

After the breakup, (he broke up with me), I started going to the gym. I signed up for OrangeTheory during a promotion period. Exercising has changed my life. I try to go there or to the gym in general as often as I possibly can. 

Every time I feel depressed, getting some exercise in takes the emotions away. 

And being in a place where everyone is equally trying to improve or heal, it’s empowering.

When it comes to diet. I try to eat cleaner. I have coffee and bananas for breakfast. For lunch I switch between a salad or a soup. For dinner, I try to change it up but always try low carb. I don't feel bloated anymore. I skip gas station visits. I don't get chocolate milkshakes anymore. When I get cravings, I try to drink atkins chocolate protein shakes. Pour that over ice and it tastes great.  

So consider this your wake up call, or your own sign that if you are feeling down, depressed, anxious, or anything at all - maybe even worse. Go to the gym. Sign up for a free class workout somewhere. Go do OTF, or CrossFit, or Vasa, or lifetime. Just go do something. Anything. 

It will change your life. And stay consistent. Show up for yourself. Just keep going. Go every day if you can. If we did recess and gym class every day in school, then we can do a daily workout. 

I’m still not over my relationship, but my relationship with fitness has changed entirely. I’m 2 months in, and I don’t want to stop. I miss my ex a lot. I've been making a lot of healthy changes. And regardless of what happens, I am healthier now.

Thanks for reading this, and please stay healthy. Even if every braincell and your heart in your body is telling you to give up on life. Go. Just try it.

For clarification, it's not a date. Just a hangout. I think she's an INFJ, but I've only met her twice so I could be wrong. We met at a Bible study, and we just....vibed. We didn't talk much to each other considering we were there to learn, but she seemed legit and worth getting to know. So of course my anxious ass had to ask for her number before she left. 

Only problem is that I've never had the upper hand in social situations :/ I am the copy and paste definition of INTP, with a few exceptions. I've been working on my charisma and overall being less dense, but I'm not where I need to be either. Should there be any awkward silence, I'm bringing a strategy game just in case.

But what do I do to carry the conversation? I def don't initiate conversation unless I'm already close to the person. Which I'm obviously not in this case. And unless she turns out to be a yapper -- and that has not been my experience with INFJs -- I'll be responsible for maintaining the peace bc I went out of my way to set this up. Yk?

I've considered playing 20 questions with her, or literally asking her 20 questions like ""if you could live anywhere, where would it be"". And hopefully one of those questions could spark an intellectual conversation. My problem is that I'd have to write the questions down and bring them with me because I have the memory of a goldfish, and I'm concerned it might rube her the wrong way.

This a good idea? Kind of overthinking it. Any tips you have to offer would be very appreciated.",1,1743693610.0,mbti,0,1.0,False

What could this be?,"( sorry if the English is shitty, its not my first language and my keyboard sometimes skips letters.)

  
*Edit since the last post got removed: I take no medication; I don't smoke, do drugs or drink alcohol and I rarely drink coffee. The medical information I can think of that could be relevant is: I somewhat have a tendency to step wrong on my foot and roll my ankle (usually doesn't result in injuries, I can just walk it off), I am around 20kg overweight, I eat kinda shittily ( I eat mostly snacks and ready made food, but I do eat healthy home cooked food about every other day. ) and I pretty much spend all my time in my room on my phone or computer. I do bike to and from uni, which is like 30 min a work day. I would bike or walk for a hour or two a day as a form of exercise when my leg was good. I don't do sports.*

I was just standing, putting something away, when my knee decided to rotate to the left, make 3-4 cracking sounds and just buckle while my foot stayed in place. I fell to the floor and couldn't move my foot for the next few seconds. I couldn't walk at all for the next 3 days and even moving my knee or ankle would hurt. Afterwards I could walk for short distances with A LOT of limping. My parents were planing to take me to the doctor on day 3, but that evening I managed to walk and straighten my leg out by relaxing it and using my hands, so they said its not a broken bone and it will heal by itself. It didn't rally hurt when I straightened it like that, I was just really scared, but there was this weird uncomfortable feeling I don't really know how to describe. You know that feeling you get when you are about to bend your normal joints too much? Something like that. Well, now that I try to actually bend my healthy joint too much, I see its not exactly like that, but that was going thy my head when I tried to move my injured leg. There was some swelling for a few days but I don't remember for how long.

Over these 3 weeks it got better and better. Now I can walk pretty much perfectly, but cant run or jump and it kinda hurts if I rotate my leg. I made a bit of a setback by sanding too hard on my straightened out leg like a week ago, but its back to healing now.

As its healing more and more every day, I will most likely not go to the doctor, I'm just curious to know what it is. Also to know how to prevent it in the future, cause I cant think of anything that could have caused it. I would understand if I steeped weird or on something, but I was just standing in place on fčat ground",1,1743693599.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jql7h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1jql7h3/ive_been_causing_my_insomnia/,I've been causing my insomnia,"Sort of. I didn't start it but I've been keeping it going.

TLDR; nicotine intake from my vape in the evening & night has been stopping me from being able to fall asleep for the past month where I've been getting 4 hours on average. 

In April 2020 I stopped benzos and this began 2 weeks later. At one point in April 2020, a few weeks after not being able to sleep, I stayed up for 7 nights straight, didn't get even an hour. Thought I was going to die because at the same time I had athlete's foot on 1 foot which was causing a feather-like touching sensation all over my body and I couldn't figure out why as I was told it stays on the foot. At the same time I got heart-failure. At the same time me and my gf were attacked in a home invasion. 

My nervous system has been shot ever since. 2020-2024, I got 1-3 hours a night. It very much derailed my life. My weight shot up from 240lbs to 310lbs.

I eat a balanced diet that looks like a garden+handful of meat, I only drink water and tea/coffee, I'm losing 6.5lbs/month, I don't eat seed oils, I walk my dog for an hour a day when the weather is nice. I do a lot of healthy shit. I was going to buy blue light filtering glasses and L-Theanine. I don't have much stress.

I'd notice that when I can't sleep I develop athlete's foot again. Immune system takes a dive, this makes sense. When the athlete's foot clears up I still have insomnia. I thought it was athlete's foot causing insomnia and doctors said that wasn't the case.

I was sleeping well from August 2024 to March 1st 2025. 2 minutes to fall asleep, sleeping for 2-4 hours at a time. It was grand. I had trouble moving past the 7 hour mark, though. In July 2024 I started biking every day, a calorie deficit. I've lost 57lbs since July. I suppose exercising helped me sleep. Then winter came and I've been indoors since.

I had suspected that due to being stressed out at night I would vape a lot more nicotine then - I've been at 6mg/ml, using a dripper at 100w for the last 10 years. I previously never suspected this to be a problem because I've been doing it for 10 years without issue but what changed was vaping at night because I used to never bring my vape to bed because I'd sleep 8 hours straight.

Over the last 3 months I've reduced nicotine by 1mg/ml per month so now I'm at 3mg/ml. It didn't help me sleep.

What did help me sleep was reducing to 0mg nicotine using non-nicotine e-juice. Yesterday I stopped using nicotine at 2:30pm, in bed at 9pm. The half life of nicotine is 2 hours so after 2 hours it's 50% and around 12 hours it's reduced by like 97.5%. Screens all day, I fell asleep by 9:05. I can't even remember what position I fell asleep in. I didn't get up out of bed after tossing. I can't remember anything. I picked a position and I was OUT. I slept for 3.5 hours, woke up for 30 mins, then slept for 4.5 hours. Doctors would tell me that it's probably not a nicotine thing, that it's because I'm fat and have high blood pressure. I think I have high blood pressure due to insomnia. In 2019 I was 240lbs, had normal blood pressure and slept 8 hours straight. They always look past that fact and ask if I want to be put on statins. 

All month I've been taking magnesium biglycinate, melatonin sometimes, ashwagandha, vitamin D. They all calm my muscles and make me feel better but didn't have any effect on sleep.

Sunlight seems to make me yawn more in the evening, I was facing the sun in the morning for 3 days but it has been cloudy since. At this longitude in Northern Canada Chatgpt says that my skin isn't able to convert much UVB light into vitamin D3 if at all and said I should supplement. I actually noticed a big difference with my eyesight, it seems easier to read and process information after an hour of taking D3 but I can only speculate as it's fat soluable and should take awhile just to absorb.

I got a blood test the other day to check cortisol, glucose, cholesterol and electrolytes and I'm waiting to go back to see the results... but I'm pretty sure that I've been vaping so much at night that it has stopped my brain from being able to nod off. I've been smoking thc: cbd in a 1:1 for 3 weeks and it does work fairly well but at the cost of being uncomfortably high. I lay there and deal with it, it wears off and then I crash. That works... but it sucks.

In order to go back and see my family (on a ticket I can afford) it is a 20 hour flight including all the layovers.

My father and I have always had a tumultuous relationship. He’s just always been very belittling or unkind.

He once compared me to a famous actress, I said thank you, that the actress is very pretty. He countered that the actress was smart too, but I only looked like her. 

He makes comments like that to belittle me or dismissive behavior to put me down all the time. But he’s my dad and I love him.

It made a little bit more sense after Christmas (2024) after I took a 23 and Me test.

My father isn’t my biological father. 

After I was done processing I called him and told him. I felt that he had a right to know, and keeping it secret felt dishonest.

I thought it was going to be a really hard conversation, but it turned out great.

He said that he always suspected, but despite that he always considered me to be his daughter. That I shouldn’t worry and he would always be my dad. That if I wanted to he could do a legal adoption. It was sweet and kind and one of the best communications we’ve ever had.

I thought it would be good to go back home and visit. So many things had happened! It felt like my relationship with my dad has turned over a new leaf and I really wanted to see him. My best friend and husband had a baby that I wanted to meet, and I wanted to meet my biological father and siblings.

With the time it takes to travel it shakes out to only actually having 4 days to see people, but the tickets were cheaper than usual so I decided to go for it.

I was going to spend two days with my friend and the baby, one day with my dad, and one day meeting my biological father.

For the meet up with my dad I asked him if he could think of a couple things he felt comfortable doing because he had knee surgery 8 months before and he is still recovering.

It’s also worth noting that my friend (who I was staying with) doesn’t want my father inside their house. So we weren’t able to veg out and watch tv, which is my dad’s preference. I tried to pick out small activities that were about spending time together. 

He refused to be involved in planning anything telling me that he just wanted to go with the flow.

I decided on going to a coffee shop, a small walk on a scenic path with a lot of benches, a restaurant, bird watching in the park. If we still had time after we could go to another restaurant or an art museum or movies. 

I did my best to make it work and find options that he has always liked in the past.

I knew he would want to head back early to avoid driving in the dark, so we decided to meet early in the morning so we could still have a full day together.

He lives about 5 to 7 hours away now depending on traffic and drove in the day before. He stayed with a friend so we could meet in the morning.  But he didn’t show up. 

When I messaged him about it he hadn’t even started getting ready. He blamed me saying he didn’t have the address of where I was staying, but he had been there so many times through my childhood I hadn’t thought he would need it. (My friend purchased their childhood home from their parents).

He didn’t show up until noon.
We met up went to coffee, a small walk then the restaurant for an early lunch. 

When we were leaving the restaurant he only left a two dollars for the waitress. When I added some more cash to the table he got upset with me, told me that I smelled bad, and pointed out spit up on my shirt from my friend’s baby. (I hadn’t realized it was there) 

He brought me back to my friend’s house so I could change. 

The most I could have been inside was five minutes. 

When I came back out he said he was leaving. 

That if he left now he would be able to avoid rush hour and that the extra time with me at the park wasn’t worth getting a hotel.

We had only spent two hours together.

I asked him if he was sure. I asked if he wanted to do something else together. I told him that it’s really hard for me to come out. I wasn’t sure when I would be able to see him again. That I missed him.

He responded by saying he wished I brought the grandkids, and that he was glad they had my husband as a parent. Then he left.

I went back inside and sobbed. 

Since then I’ve been low contact. Having my husband send messages, or replying only with the bare minimum.

My heart just feels broken. And so confused. I tried so hard to make it a nice visit so he would be comfortable and I’m not sure where it all went wrong. 

My sister says it’s been enough time and that I should make more of an effort to reach out to him.

btw - i bring up comparison to zoe sugg, not because i'm obsessed with zoe's content, but because i think it's closest to the millennial energy and homemaking vlog style content that michel has that i personally watch. 

1. ""i often wait too long to make dinner, eat three chomp sticks and a protein bar."" based on her vlogs, she is usually just... home? so it's a little odd to me that this is a habit of hers, especially given that cooking is her passion and she's taken culinary classes. why don't her and jordy eat dinners together? i wouldn't mind seeing her set up an actual \*sit-down\* dinner with her husband, with place settings, candles, actual date vibes. i've mentally bookmarked this as a yellow flag, but i don't know her personally and i'm not a doctor. 

2. jordy is never there. i know he's busy, touring, in the garage, but it strikes me that michel is always in her kitchen, opening the blinds in sweats and her apple airmaxes, making a nespresso, home alone. always. it feels very empty and isolating to me. outside of her family, where are and who are her friends...? and can we see them more? 

3. and when jordy is there, it's awkward. what was the day date from the most recent vlog? no conversation, walking to a cafe while she talked to the camera about going to the cafe, and ordering coffee, tasting it, and going home, which she does without jordy all the time. at one point, she mentioned going to the next cafe, and his 'response' was his perpetual rictus and a shrug. that's a day date with your spouse? compare that to zoe sugg's most recent vlog 'brunch date' with alfie - flower shopping, coffee, brunch, flower arranging, gardening together, actual interaction, joking, and conversation. 

4. i love espresso but she is only ever coffee tasting. i feel that if that is the most interesting activity she can find on any given day, something is amiss. i'm at a point where i keep watching her videos out of the fascination, but feel bummed out the entire time. pls no more surface-level cafe latte review (""mm that tastes so good!"" ""mm not bad but not good""), again. 

5. ""coastal lifestyle"" is on her youtube banner, and it's been puzzling me for months (see #6). other than living by the beach and finding shells sometimes, i'm not getting how the coastal lifestyle thing is her brand. she's mentioned wanting to move to vermont, and, well, that did not happen because of jordy and this house. if she was unmarried, i imagine she would be there by now. 

6. ""coastal lifestyle"" idea time. if her passion is cooking and ""coastal lifestyle"", then i want to see beach vlogs, learning how to surf, how to cook great seafood. if her passion is also coffee (same!), then why not show people how to make great tasting lattes at home? how to make homemade coffee syrups? can she think of her favorite latte OUT and try to replicate it at hOME (she mentioned a snickerdoodle-y drink somewhere that sounded good)? why not share the tips she's supposed to be learning in her culinary class (is that happening offscreen still, i'm so confused)? since caroline winkler has been shared a lot here (not my personal favorite creator, but she seems genuine), can't michel share some coastal interior design tips? actual ones, not just shopping at ikea and doing another handy thing that jordy isn't helping with and decluttering a closet again? like, thrifting and flipping, goodwill hauls, how to hang wall art, organization tips, etc? maybe doing seasonal re-decorating? what about local farmers markets and making meals from great produce? what about boating? slow-living? GARDENING??????? flower arranging??? what about a cookbook review? can we get a video where she talks about what she loves about where she lives? nothing about the vlogs themselves scream coastal lifestyle other than following the aesthetic trend of it. ""coastal lifestyle"" but she's always indoors. she says only personal things get her views, but i would beg to differ, i would enjoy her content if it was less repetitive and more varied. 

7. pls, no more try-on clothing segments and asking us to comment what we think. they are the same 3 colors, the same 3 items of clothing, always quince, revolve, or everlane. 

8. she is only ever in her kitchen or bedroom. at-home vlogs can be fun, but she doesn't seem to make anything fun for herself. like, i would even take a rot day vlog, as long as it was interesting with an interesting person... face mask, tea, cookie baking, movie night, how to make good stove popcorn, etc.

I have nearly 400 hours into it and play it every morning with my coffee. However, I have a small list of things that could be improved and features that should be added to enhance the player experience of this game.


1. Tractor speed

I feel the tractor speed is a little slow. My character can run just as fast as the tractor on grass, sand, etc (minus on walking paths). Even a 5% speed increase would help tremendously as these farms are pretty large. Automatic mode also seems a little slow when harvesting flowers, animals, and trees, but I think it's current speed is good for harvesting / planting / watering crops.

2. Mass recycling by plot

When the player goes to their map, plots should be outlined when hovered over. The user can then click on the plot, and press X to recycle everything in that plot (should be double confirmed). This would make clearing newly unlocked plots a lot faster. If a user wants to redo their tree or flower section, they don't have to spend hours and hours deleting everything, or mass recycling their entire farm. This could be implemented with an upgrade purchase of the landscaping shop.

3. Swap item function

This would be nice if you want to change the position of a row of flowers or trees. The user can select a row of flowers, press the swap button (may need to be implemented?) and select a different row of flowers, then press enter to swap their positions. It would really help when rearranging things and dealing with a tight space, especially when new items are added. This could also be an upgrade for the landscaping shop.

4. Mushrooms

I used the donations I've recieved and bought not only coffee, but it also paid for half of my upgrade to a Fenix 8 :)

I just released a v2.0 of the watch face. All the rendering is rewritten resulting in much less memory and CPU usage. Battery life should improve. It's now also feasible to do more layouts changes for some settings (like when hiding labels, or different text alignment).

Having a AMOLED watch to test on will also mean visual fine-tuning. More of that to come. 

Finally I have some early plans for a Nixie tube inspired watch face.

I will admit that in the beginning I wasn’t taking the dieting part very seriously and I wasn’t making the necessary changes. Now for the past 2 months or so I have been seriously tracking everything I eat. According to multiple TDEE trackers my calorie deficit amount is around 1770 calories per day for weight loss. I know for a fact I’m way below that. Most of my meals are less than 500 calories. My breakfast is 265 (always have the same thing) lunch is typically around 350 to 400 and the same for lunch. The only drink I have besides water is a morning coffee with monk fruit and a little bit of 2% milk. If I’m feeling like snacking I’ll have a slice of ham or a fruit. Now I haven’t noticed any change in the scale at all for the past month. Every time I weight myself it’s between 186.3 and 186.9. My mom does say she sees I’m losing fat because she says my face looks a lot slimmer but that may just be her because I don’t notice a difference. That being said I do go to the gym 5 to 6 times a week, my split being 2 days upper, 2 days lower and 1 or 2 days of cardio. I don’t lift much on upper days but I do lift pretty heavy on lower days.

So, I'm about to be 30 and I've decided I need to focus more on my health. I've realized I can't simply eat anything I want without consequences. For example, I would eat two to three times per day and snack in between with chips and junk food. So I've been focused on a one-meal-a-day regimen. I work 9 to 5 without eating breakfast or lunch. I make a coffee with 1 teaspoon honey and a cup of oakmilk mixed with espresso. Then, for dinner, I'd go with heavy carbs and high protein, which would be around 1500 calories. Later in the day, I'd work out and have 60 g of protein shake. That will be it, however. This is where I need to exercise self-control. I like to munch on small chips or snacks. So I was curious what your tricks are for controlling your urges. I want to attempt to stick to 2000 calories and at least 200g of protein. I weigh 230 pounds, stand 6 feet 1 inch tall, and have a BMI of about 25%. I'm pretty fit, working out 4-5 times per week for 2 hours each.

Thanks for creating such a great community and I am happy to share that I made it three months into blogging.  It has taken a lot of work and been a blast to finally start. Wooohooo!

I had wanted to start for a number of years and always had an excuse to not.  There was no big 'Ah-ha' moment that got the ball rolling.  I just decided to finally give it a go and began typing away on a word document.  Then deleted what I had written, wrote again, deleted, etc. till I finally got a post going.

It's not a crazy blog chasing after money, SEO understanding, or probably really ever going to grow to be serve a large audience.  My main tool I use to help supplement my writing is coffee and the backup is popcorn which brings enough joy for me. 

As a small blogger, I totally feel happy about that. It means that I get to call myself a blogger and a writer! Do I make mistakes? Certainly.  Do I make money? Hahaha. Do I care about feedback? As long as it's positive but hey, one step at a time.

It's a hobby blog that focuses on running.  No big motivation outside of sharing some of my running stories and get more involved with the online running community.  It's something I have enjoyed doing my whole life, even though I am slow, and a great place to document my journey!

What I am most proud to share though is that I hit my big milestone of telling someone I started a blog, my wife! She is so supportive in what I want to do and I had a lot of nerves to share with anyone that I was going to be writing.  It feels vulnerable to have my words out there and it opens the doors to feedback which I tend to be more on the emotional side of things.  I tend to not put myself out there in things I do but hey, I am happy to go through this growth.

I’ve been on dates before but never in a relationship, and afterward, I felt something I’ve never felt before — like, that’s her, that’s the one I’ve been waiting for. But now, I’m afraid I might have messed it up.

We started with coffee and later went for a walk. From the very beginning, we really hit it off. At one point, she even started holding my hand. When it was time to say goodbye, we shared this beautiful moment — holding each other close and agreeing we wanted to see each other again. It was perfect.

Then, for some reason, I leaned in for a kiss. Which is totally unlike me. I’m usually charming and a gentleman, but I’ve never done that on a first date. She moved away and said, ""Uh, I don’t really do that on the first date."" I immediately told her it was okay — but looking back, I worry it might have come across as if it was her fault. After that, we chatted for another minute said goodbye.

When she got home, she texted me (which I had asked her to do), and I told her again how much I enjoyed our time together. I also mentioned that if she was free before next Sunday, she should let me know, since I’d be away for a week after that. She replied she'll definitely(!) do that — with no weird tone or hesitation.

The next day, I texted her to ask how her day was. But afterward, I felt like I might have been overdoing it. We’re both not really texters, so maybe I should have just waited for her to reach out first. After a quick back-and-forth, I sent a message that naturally ended the conversation — nothing awkward, just nothing that invited more messages.

Now I’m sitting here, seemingly only waiting for the ""Let's not meet again"" message and wondering: Can I come back from this, or did I screw it up? I figure the best way to best and only way to recover is to see her again, so let’s assume that happens — should I mention the kiss-that-wasn't at all? How should I act on the second date? Are any of these topics off-limits?

My bf (30m) & (25f) have been together for 5 years. We have had some ups and down but in general we have an amazing relationship. I get on with his family and he does with mine, we go on lots a travels together. 

However, I really need some advise.

I’ve having a bad week with my anxiety but will managing to go the gym and make sure I eat but I feel like my boyfriend hasn’t been there for me. 

I’ve told him I was struggling, that I wasn’t sleeping well and that I just been feeling low but he’s been busy all week and not really made any effort to see me - even if it’s just an hour. He has called and texted and asked how I am but that was really it.

We do have plans on Saturday night to see each other but I felt given I texted him on Tuesday, want to do something - I am struggling a bit. He should have seen me for an hour or so one of the days before Saturday.

I don’t wanna get into too much detail about the specifics but he’s had a bad last year and half due to a horrible unexpected death in the family, it’s been horrible to see it happen but he is doing a lot better now which is amazing. 

He has a new mindset on trying to better himself with the gym and make more money but I feel with this mindset specially this week, I’ve been a second thought almost ?

I know I can be over critical / it is something I am working on myself, but I just feel that maybe I might be valid here?

He’s taking it as I’m always complaining about issue to him, instead of having conversations about the issue. 

Please can someone give me some advice ? Or am I the asshole for expecting this ? 

Edit to add:
My anxiety only gets bad to when I have panic attacks, I have panic disorder and it can feel like everything is very overwhelming. This can come from work or worrying about career or life choices etc 

It helps when someone closes to me can be there for like a walk or for a coffee. 

I do things to manage my anxiety, like go to the gym five times a week, eat healthy and make sure I go on walks alone with my dog. I also journal. 

My bf can be there for me even when he is having a bad time himself, for him - he likes to be in own space and he will talk to me about his feelings. We both have different coping styles.

I don’t expect him to be there all night/day but an offer to come see me would be nice after I’ve asked and he’s said he’s busy. 

Edit 2:

When he went through the loss of someone very close to him, I was there for him non stop. I made sure he ate, I was hanging out with all the time - I baked stuff for his family and I sent stuff to his and got him little stuff. 

He’s a private person so I don’t wanna go into too much details but he likes to be on his own when he deals with stuff and then talks to me about his feelings and loves our relationship as a break from the grief. 

I on the other hand, I can deal with anxiety alone, I am capable of doing this - all I needed was “hey, would you wanna go for a walk or come over for a bit?” ",0,1743692564.0,TwoHotTakes,41,0.47,False

1jqkiu5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqkiu5,Need an advice,"Good day,

I’ve tried to post it on DIY subreddit, but they deleted my post because it was off topic. So I will try my luck here.

I have a question for you all. I’ve been watching a guy on TikTok who was making a coffee table that looked really cool to me. Everyone was asking how he made it, but since he was selling it online, he probably didn’t want to share his secret.

I spent a couple of hours digging and found some videos on how to make something at least similar. Now, here’s the problem—I don’t have much knowledge about construction and materials.

Could someone please help me identify what kind of material he was using to coat the foam? I know it’s hard to determine from a photo, but maybe you could give me some advice on what kind of products I should use to achieve a similar result.

1jqkfbk,https://i.redd.it/bc1br7dtumse1.png,Are veneers my only option to fix my chipped front tooth?,"Hello!

Quire self-explanatory I guess?

As you can see, I have braces, and treatment will take at least another 12 months - but as my front teeth are a big insecurity of mine, I want to understand my options for when the braces come off!

So, I chipped my front teeth around 5 years ago, and since then, there's been some wear and tear to that tooth as well, making it much shorter than my other front tooth.

Here are the options I'd like to explore;

1. Veneers on both front teeth (and only my front teeth)
3. Composite bonding - but I feel like veneers would be a better option, I've heard that composite bonding is not very durable

So I guess I am indeed leaning towards veneers - but I'm not sure I love the idea of having to file down my own teeth... it's also a financial commitment because veneers aren't cheap and if they break, I imagine it being costly.

Based off this picture, would it be possible to put the veneers in without any filing maybe?

Lots of new things to report since my last update. My wife and her FWB have been on lots of dates and things are going well between them. I've met her and I like her. My wife is happy and I often see her smiling at her phone. I have no regrets about opening.

As for myself, about a month after my wife and her FWB started dating I went ahead and made my own profile on Feeld and matched with a nice married woman within the week. We spent a week or two talking, then met for coffee, a movie, lunch, and after about a week had our first hookup. Currently we have lunch together about once a week, and hang out in the evenings once or twice a week. My wife has been incredibly supportive and happy with everything, and there's been no problems with my FWBs husband either. 

I feel incredibly fortunate.

""I don't think this is a good use of our time, Shea.""

""This is a great use of our time, Marcus."" The Dryad barked back, still dragging him along through some alleyways.

For a reason he could not yet understand, Shea thought it was absolutely imperative that they find whoever stole their money- his money which she has claimed as theirs. They have been at this for a little over two hours now, scouring every corner and side-road of Southsworn only to have searched about one forth of the city.

""Shouldn't we, I don't know, warn anybody about this goblin invasion thing?""

""You're still on about that? I told you it's going to be fine- plus I don't think anybody will believe it.""

""Kh- You're a Dryad for Deus' sake! Shouldn't that be enough?!""

""Marcus."" She paused briefly, turning her head to him. ""Have you heard of a thing called 'lying'?""

""What's that got to do with anything??""

Shea continued dragging him along. ""I'm saying why won't people think I won't be lying?""

""That... does not matter at all! Come on, Shea!"" Marcus started reaching the end of his patience, a thing that he felt was happening way too often with her around.

""Uughhhh..."" Even with her facing away, Marcus could feel the gigantic roll her eyes did. ""I'm still hungry thouuughhh.""

""Can't you like, photosynthesize or whatever it's called?""

""First of all, rude, second of all, how do you know what that is but never heard of a doughnut??""

""Agh, uh... I think it may have been a touchy subject to my teachers?"" Ever since he has laid eyes upon the round pastries, he's begun noting an eerie similarity between them and Providence's Guardians, somehow. ""Anyhow, my question still stands.""

""I..."" The Dryad looked a bit embarrassed. ""I can, okay?!""

""Great, then we don't need money for food!""

""And how about you?""

""I still have some reserves. You don't seem like the type to eat dry-cooked squirrel though.""

""Blegh, damn right."" Shea stuck out her tongue in recoil. ""But where will we sleep then- and do not say outside or something, I already had enough of that.""

""Uhhh... I can sell some of my extra stuff?"" Marcus coyly suggested, looking for any excuse to stop loitering in the backstreets of Southsworn.

""That's a great idea!"" Doing a sharp U-turn, Shea dragged him back to the main streets and to the nearest shop.

""Gah, hey! Easy now!"" The duo burst through the door, causing a new bell to ring roughly. A blonde woman with a ponytail behind the counter straightened up and fix her white uniform. Shea spun Marcus around, putting him face in face to the green-eyed woman. He could smell faint cigarettes smoke coming off her and he just notice her weird cap with a red plus on it. ""Uhm, hello? I'd like to...sell some of my stuff?""

The blond woman's smile faded and she sighed. ""This is a nursery, not a merchant's. I heal people here"" She rested her elbows over the counter and rubbed her forehead.

Marcus turned around and gave the Dryad a sharp glare. ""Did you just really enter the first shop you saw?"" He folded his hands and shook his head disappointingly.

""Oh come on, they all look the same!"" Shea protested, pouting back at him.

Turning back around he looked very apologetic. ""I'm so sorry for this, but can you tell us where the nearest merchant place is?""

""Yeah, down the road like ten houses on the left, you can't miss it."" The healer woman waved her hand with defeat in her voice.

""Thanks, also, where could we- I notify some authorities that, uh, don't ask where I know this but, the goblins may-""

""Cooomeeeee ooonnn, Marcussss, you heard her."" Like an impatient child, the Dryad pulled on his arm to get him to move on. The Nurse, however, seemed a bit surprised.

The hooded adventurer was about to tell his partner off, but the blonde got ahead of him. ""Wait, Marcus...? This may sound a bit weird but... do you know a man named Willard?""

Marcus immediately forgot he was angry at Shea. ""Wha- Yeah, an older guy traveling merchant with a blue overcoat...""

""Oh Deus, it really is you! Willard told me a lot about you- Ah, where are my manners, I'm Claire!"" The gloom on her face immediately got replaced by an excited smile.

""Willard talked about me? Oh wow, I guess he must visit here often then. Nice to meet you!"" Marcus also found himself pleasantly surprised.

""Hey, don't forget about me."" Shea poked him.

""Oh you already know"" Claire quipped back. Both of them then laughed, totally ignoring the Dryad.

 

...............

 

Stuffy clothes, pompous food, an air of elitism so thick you could choke on it- Yeah, Willard hated it here. He was happy for Isaac, as much as he could be realistically, but he really, really disliked the atmosphere at the wedding party. Why did he come then? Arthur himself invited him, and Deus knows he couldn't say no. Still wouldn't stop him from complaining. All this brooding though made him fail to notice the young woman approaching him.

""You stick out like a sore thumb, y'know?"" She had a long black dress, not the most elegant he's seen so far, a deep red-ish brown hair that reached to her shoulders and pale blue eyes. What did catch his attention were the pair of goggles hanging from her neck.

""You yourself stand out too, miss."" The older merchant chuckled.

""Then, what brings you here? You don't strike me as some big entrepreneur or royalty Brianad wants to coax into business relationship."" She crosses her hands over her chest.

""Eh, you could say I'm an acquaintance of Brianad."" Willard said with a slight pang.

""Wow, coulour me impressed then."" A slight smirk appeared on her lips with her sarcastic comment.

""Already making friends I see, William?"" Out of nowhere, the devil they spoke of appeared.

""I told you... to not call me that."" Willard scowled.

""Hahah, sorry, I forgot... Ahem, let me introduce you. Willard, this is Verity, an executive at Draehab. Verity, this is Willard, a man with a long story to tell."" Arthur spoke.

""Draehab? That steampunk city all the way in Atrotia?"" Willard, already trying to push past the awkward introduction Arthur gave him, asked her.

""Damn right! The technological capital of Terraria, baby!"" Verity put her hands on her hips and puffed her chest proudly.

""Ahh, explains the goggles."" The merchant pointed to her neck.

""These bad boys? I've had then since I was a little lass still working with wooden toys. I carry them everywhere I go.""

""That's very nice, haha\~"" Arthur clapped his hands. ""But, William, I was actually looking for you."" He called him over to a secluded corner

With an suspicious look shared between them, Willard did just that.

""I have gotten some worrying news from down South."" He whispered. ""The goblins are preparing for an assault and their main target seems to be Southsworn.""

""That is worrying indeed but what do you need me for?"" A bit impatient, Willard asked.

""I need you down there. The Southsworn military will be caught unaware and the losses will be too great.""

""How did you know before them?"" The traveling merchant grimaced.

""I have connections, do not worry."" Arthur lightly sighed.

""So? Tell them instead!"" Willard barked, nearly catching the attention of other party-goers.

""Why should I, when I have you instead? Nobody will know."" He patted him on the shoulder. ""Nobody found out last time either, right?""

""That's not even remotely-""

""Great, you better take your leave now, unless you want to be late. Wouldn't want that now, would we?"" Arthur left Willard alone to simmer angrily.

After grumbling some curses under his breath, the travelling merchant took his trusty coat from the chair it was sitting on and ran off like the wind.

\-

""Huh, I wonder what's that guy's deal."" said Trevon, sipping on some really expensive coffee, along with Rossetta and her exquisite tea.

 

...............

 

""So like, you built everything in your little camp?"" Claire asked curiously.

""Heheh, basically so."" Marcus, now leaning on the counter, tried to sound cool to hide that he's very flattered by the attention.

""Hgnnn...."" Shea was sitting down next to a wall, knees up to her chin and legs wrapped in her arms.

""What's up with her?"" The Nurse pointed to the sad sack of living leaves.

""Oh, I don't know. Anyhow-""

""AGH! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"" Suddenly springing up to her feet, Shea starts pulling at her vine-like hair. ""You. If you like talking with Marcus so much just move to his damn home! Look-"" She pulled out the map (https://disco.pics/ge05.png) from his backpack. ""I-It's right here! Please!"" She pointed desperately to the X that was noted with 'home'

""I-"" Claire tried to speak up, but it failed.

""Great! It's decided! Goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!"" Grabbing Marcus by the arm again, she drags him out of the blond woman's shop. She continued dragging him up until they were in front of the pawn shop.

""Rude."" He let himself get pushing inside and up to the counter. ""Uhm, yeah, hello, I want to sell some stuff..."" The merchant looked a bit surprised but eventually got to business.

""Ah, hello let's see- Guh?!"" The man's eyes widened in awe when Marcus took out some shadow scales and demonite. ""S-Sir, where do you have these?!""

*""Oh yeah, the whole goblin thing.""* Marcus scratches his chin. ""Uhh, I have some connections...?""

The shop's merchant scrounged his nose and raised and eyebrow. ""Is that so... And you want to sell them to me, sir?""

""I'm younger than you, m-mister, but yeah.""

""Doesn't matter! You are a sir!"" He leaned back behind the counter and searched for something. After a while, he got back up and threw two gold and half a dozen silver coins on the counter.

""Woah, isn't that a bit much?"" He said, even though his old coin pouch had roughly five times more money.

""No, sir! Demonite is a good material! It's a shame there's so little of it to go around.""

""Great!"" Shea swooped in suddenly to take the coins. ""Let's go!"" And once again dragged him out.

""Ah-! Uh, thanks-"" His goodbye was cut off short by the door slamming behind him.

""Hmm... Wait, was that a Dryad?""

\-

Cutting through crowds without a care in the world, Shea continued dragging and yanking Marcus around the streets of Southsworn, stars swirling in her eyes as she spotted in front of a stand who served some sort of chicken with veggies and sauces all wrapped in flat piece of bread

""Ooooh, finally!"" Shea skipped gleefully over, pouch of coins in hand. ""I haven't had something like this in- agh, hey! Watch where you are going! Damn humans.... Ah, mister I'd like-..."" Patting the spot where she had the pouch, the Dryad's face goes pale. ""MARCUS!!! IT'S THEM!! THE THIEF!!!!!!!!"" At the top of her voice she screamed, turning to the stranger she bumped into.

Marcus was right after them. *""Same hat, same vest, same hair- It really is them!""* The Shield of Cthulhu, which was hidden by Vanity so far, materializes as Marcus dashes forward, similarly hidden Spectre boots launch him in the air to gain a better vantage. People gasp and move, pushing and bumping into each other. ""I got you!"" Pulling out the first thing to enter his hand, the Bee Keeper and comes crashing down with a swing aimed at the thief. However though, they only get maimed and soon just simply vanish within the crowd. *""What? I blinked and they disappeared. What in Deus' name?""* He rubbed his eyes to confirm it was true, no blood, no marks, nothing. Marcus looked around and the stunned crowd looked at the scene aghast, mostly because of him.

""Marcus!"" Wedging herself through the wall of spectators, stepped through. This seems to break the people out of their stupor and they also begin moving. ""Did you get them?!""

He shook his head. ""I did manage to hit the thief though, but there's no blood.""

""Wha- How?! Did they use stealth...? Oh Silva..."" Shea looked on the verge of tears for being denied food twice in a day.

""But I hit them with this."" The hooded adventurer gestured to the sword still in it's hands

""And?"" Miffed she crosses her arms.

Marcus smirked in response

\-

*""Hahaha, what fools, I robbed them twice.""* Jade pulls down their mask and undoes stealth after entering an hidden away alleyway. *""What a big haul, this may make up for my losses with that camp.""* They felt the two pouches clink with coins. *""Ah, let's- Sound.""* Jade immediately went flush with the wall, triggering stealth again. *""Hm... It's a... buzzing...?""* They couldn't believe their eyes as two bees rounded the corner. *""Wha-? No, shoo, go away, stop flying near me.""*

""You just have to trust me on this one"" Another voice, masculine, ringed out from the corner where the bees came.

""It better work!"" And together with it, a feminine one.

*""They found out my location already? How? I trained as a rogue so much even my blood gets hidden by stealth.""* Jade grimaced. *""Gah- These bees, why are they hovering so close to me-""* They stood as still as possible as the two rounded the corner. *""Oh, Deus, why must I be so unlucky!!""*

The lady in dressed vines puts her hands on her hips with a satisfied smile on her face. ""Well, I'll be damned, Marcus, it actually worked.""

The armored guy, obviously using some vanity spell, rolled his eyes. He just took a few more steps towards Jade, looked at the spot they would be in were it not for the stealth. *""Of course, he's checking out the bees. Calm down Jade, of course it would be suspicious if some-""* Any hopes of being unnoticed would fade, along with their stealth, as the Marcus guy nailed a sharp jab in their gut. *""Oh... This might be my unluckiest week yet.""*

Instead of offering a replacement for the tarnished piece, corporate gifted her a coffee table book that goes deep into the technicalities behind manufacturing the Alhambra motif. I honestly think her disappointment was justified; she didn’t buy a luxury bracelet for it to tarnish so easily, and she seemed really polite and willing throughout the process.

1jqk2sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1jqk2sj/kendu_the_true_crypto_cult/,Kendu - The True Crypto Cult,"**Kendu Introduction**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million and Kendu has went through several redistribution periods.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.

Kendu has a heavy focus on IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

https://preview.redd.it/cwit3qtdrmse1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1dfb7c4b105a6ac70c371fa6312bac65290d605

**Current market conditions**

This is for sure worse than we expected at this point in the year, it is April tomorrow and things are well for lack of a better word….. fucked. However “All Things Must Pass” (I hope someone gets this reference) and things will get better, the cycle looks delayed but no one really knows. I believe 100% that there is a bull run coming and even if not, Pepe achieved a market cap of 11 billion without a bull run and Kendu can too. There is far more money in crypto now, so 11 billion mc is equivalent to probably double that now and 20 billion is a 2000x from here for Kendu.

In terms of the market:

As Satoshi Nakamoto said “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

However I will try and convince you to buy Kendu :)

**Why Kendu is organic**

Kendu is organic because organic memecoins tend to generate more results, whilst KOL based memes have a ceiling, organic memecoins are decentralised. Example of organic memecoins are Pepe, Doge and the one and only Shib.

Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion market cap in 36 days, you could have turned $1000 to $1,000,000 in 36 days.  
Current market cap is not the most important, since crypto moves so fast.

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.

https://preview.redd.it/cr1nz4qhrmse1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=36695aac3b32397a50571f96ce6304398b371b35

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far

Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy), merch and I am pretty sure a new mural

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

Just Look at these tattoos

Kendu also has many tattoos and one that I cannot show, which show ultimate levels of conviction, Kendu has overtaken people's lives and is not to be missed out on. In my opinion at least put $50 in Kendu. This could buy you a new BMW or Mercedes in the future.

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

Always remember, to never bet against a community

My wife and her parents (in their 70s but have no known mobility issues) are heading to Italy for our first time. We've been watching endless YouTube videos, reviewing blogs from Italy with Jenna, checking out Rick Steves' recommendations, and chatting with friends who have gone before. We feel we have a base level of knowledge now but still have some questions. We are aware that this is a Jubilee Year and Italy, especially Rome, will be busier. Though we know it would have been more efficient to fly into a city and out of another, we were not able to make that work so we are flying into and out of Venice. We are staying from June 12-25. We have already booked accommodations in Venice from the 12-14 but no other accommodations are booked, but we need to finalize that by this weekend if possible as we know we are cutting it close. Here are some questions we have and would greatly appreciate any insight or guidance on:

\- To us, going to Venice, Cinque Terre, Florence, and then Rome in that order seems inefficient because of having to backtrack to Venice. We know that, due to the flights we chose, that we do need to backtrack, but we're curious. Would it be worth it/doable to do a day trip to Cinque Terre from Florence and if so, then we could hit up Tuscany after Rome so that our backtrack isn't a straight shot to Venice. Basically, we primarily are interested in Venice, Florence, and Rome, but we would like an opportunity to see a coastal town even if just for a day.

\- Based on your experience and knowledge, how many nights would you spend in each of these stops?

\- My wife's parents are more so the tourists who want to hit the main touristy stops, my wife and I do enjoy seeing these, but we also like to explore off the beaten path. Our thought is to get up early and hit up the touristy spots earlier than later, and spend the second half of the day exploring less crowded spots. What are your thoughts on this and any recommendations on neighborhoods or areas in any of these cities that provide a more ""off the beaten path"" / more local feel?

\- Based on your interests, what would be 2-3 must-see sites or attractions in these cities?

\- We love food and we do not drink liquor so no ""bar"" recs but we do love coffee. Italy with Jenna gave us great tips on finding non-touristy restaurants. Could you please share any of your favorite restaurants or meals you had in these cities? No dietary restrictions. I've learned that ""bars"" are where you can go to grab pastries and coffee, so any favorites in these cities that you would recommend?

\- Lastly, my wife's parents speak very little English and we are in the search for a private Chinese tour guide who can help them during their time. Are you familiar with any services that offer this or any companies that offer even group tours in Chinese and English?

- **Adaptogenic Smoothies:** Blend your favorite adaptogenic powders into smoothies. A tablespoon of ashwagandha or maca can elevate your drink and enhance its benefits.
- **Herbal Teas:** Infuse your day with adaptogenic teas. Brands often offer premixed herbal blends that target energy, relaxation, or immunity.
- **Cooking and Baking:** Add adaptogenic powders to your baking recipes. They can blend well into muffins, energy bars, and even soups.
- **Capsules and Tinctures:** If you prefer a no-fuss method, try adaptogenic capsules or tinctures for a quick health boost.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogens for You

When selecting adaptogens, think about your specific goals. If you’re looking to enhance energy and reduce fatigue, rhodiola might be a good pick. On the other hand, if you want to manage stress and improve sleep, ashwagandha is an excellent choice. Research the benefits of different adaptogens to find the ones that suit your lifestyle.

Also, consider consulting a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have health concerns or are taking medications. They can help guide you to the right adaptogens for your needs.

### Final Thoughts

Stepping away from traditional coffee can be a refreshing change. Adaptogens offer natural, potent benefits that not only improve energy levels but also help your body manage stress better. Experiment with different adaptogens and discover what works best for you. By adding these powerful tools into your daily routine, you can unlock a more balanced and vibrant life.

So, are you ready to ditch regular coffee and embrace the world of adaptogens? You might just find the healthier, more energizing alternative you've been searching for.

By exploring these unique herbs, you open the door to a wealth of benefits that go far beyond your usual caffeine fix.

**1. this one breathing video that doesn’t talk down to you**  
i hate the ones that go “just breathe” like you’re not already trying 😭 but this one genuinely resets me when i’m buzzing:

**2. this snack: roasted peanuts + a tiny square of dark chocolate**  
the protein + crunch slows my chewing and the chocolate gives my brain a fake little dopamine win. doesn’t fix life, but it makes me less shaky and weird.

**3. swapped coffee**  
i used to rely on caffeine to “get things done,” but it made my anxiety 10x worse.  
i tried something called calm & clarity a friend sent me — it’s like a functional drink but without the jittery chaos. Sharing the link here: [https://elvd.co](https://elvd.co)

**4. this journaling prompt that keeps saving me**  
“what’s one thing that *is* going okay, even if it feels small or boring?”  
i used to scoff at that kinda stuff but now i keep a list on my phone. “my tea tasted good,” “i didn’t cry at work,” “someone sent a ‘you okay?’ text.” i reread it when i forget who i am.

**5. a youtube loop of rainy café + lo-fi + mild clutter**  
this one is my go-to: [https://youtu.be/c0\_ejQQcrwI?si=Jz9YPx5iA9BjxK9-](https://youtu.be/c0_ejQQcrwI?si=Jz9YPx5iA9BjxK9-)

My wife and her parents (in their 70s but have no known mobility issues) are heading to Italy for our first time. We've been watching endless YouTube videos, reviewing blogs from Italy with Jenna, checking out Rick Steves' recommendations, and chatting with friends who have gone before. We feel we have a base level of knowledge now but still have some questions. We are aware that this is a Jubilee Year and Italy, especially Rome, will be busier. Though we know it would have been more efficient to fly into a city and out of another, we were not able to make that work so we are flying into and out of Venice. We are staying from June 12-25. We have already booked accommodations in Venice from the 12-14 but no other accommodations are booked, but we need to finalize that by this weekend if possible as we know we are cutting it close. Here are some questions we have and would greatly appreciate any insight or guidance on:

\- To us, going to Venice, Cinque Terre, Florence, and then Rome in that order seems inefficient because of having to backtrack to Venice. We know that, due to the flights we chose, that we do need to backtrack, but we're curious. Would it be worth it/doable to do a day trip to Cinque Terre from Florence and if so, then we could hit up Tuscany after Rome so that our backtrack isn't a straight shot to Venice. Basically, we primarily are interested in Venice, Florence, and Rome, but we would like an opportunity to see a coastal town even if just for a day. 

\- Based on your experience and knowledge, how many nights would you spend in each of these stops? 

\- My wife's parents are more so the tourists who want to hit the main touristy stops, my wife and I do enjoy seeing these, but we also like to explore off the beaten path. Our thought is to get up early and hit up the touristy spots earlier than later, and spend the second half of the day exploring less crowded spots. What are your thoughts on this and any recommendations on neighborhoods or areas in any of these cities that provide a more ""off the beaten path"" / more local feel?

\- Based on your interests, what would be 2-3 must-see sites or attractions in these cities?

\- We love food and we do not drink liquor so no ""bar"" recs but we do love coffee. Italy with Jenna gave us great tips on finding non-touristy restaurants. Could you please share any of your favorite restaurants or meals you had in these cities? No dietary restrictions. I've learned that ""bars"" are where you can go to grab pastries and coffee, so any favorites in these cities that you would recommend?

\- Lastly, my wife's parents speak very little English and we are in the search for a private Chinese tour guide who can help them during their time. Are you familiar with any services that offer this or any companies that offer even group tours in Chinese and English?

Please feel free to share anything more you believe we should know. Sorry for the essay. Appreciate you!",3,1743690622.0,TravelHacks,3,0.81,False

1jqjvsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jqjvsz/softwave_trt_with_biocidin_has_been_a_big_game/,Softwave TRT with Biocidin has been a big game changer for me,"Hey all, methane Sibo/IBS C haver here. Want to preface this with saying this is my own experience and not medical advice. Always ask your doctor before starting a new treatment.

TLDR is using softwave TRT and Biocidin together has made treatment faster and more effective for me personally, to the point where in just a month of using both concurrently I am able to handle fodmaps much better. Read further for more details.

Been trying to kick this Sibo crud for several years now. Have tried several rounds of rifaximin with mixed results. Last year at the suggestion of my ND who specializes in gut issues I decided to do a longer herbal antimicrobial treatment with Biocidin. It was about 5 months of being at the full dose before I felt it was really effective at reducing my symptoms.

The Biocidin did get me to a point last year where I was symptom free with FODMAPs for several months, but I fell off the wagon during the maintenance phase of treatment. I was supposed to take a half dose once a day so the Sibo didn’t recur but I was dealing with a lot and wasn’t taking great care of myself. I ended up not taking it at all for over a month at one point. Of course, because I didn’t do the maintenance the Sibo came back.

In January of this year I got back on the Biocidin and while it was helping, it takes a long time for it to help. In February I decided to try softwave TRT therapy (  https://softwavetrt.com/  ) for treatment of my abdominal adhesions that are likely the root cause of my Sibo. I had no idea before starting treatment, but as it turns out softwave can also help break up biofilm that Sibo likes to hide in besides just breaking up adhesions.

I won’t lie it was a little rough, but I could tell a major difference in how the Biocidin was working while doing the softwave. Had major herxheimer effects, and felt like crap for several days after each treatment. It was more intense the higher power the provider used, which we worked up on over time.

I have had 6 softwave treatments over the course of mid February to mid March and am still taking the biocidin at full dose, but symptoms with fodmaps have reduced significantly compared to before starting the softwave. Not 100% symptom free but I’d say 90% and improving by the week. 

I have been having foods with onions and garlic, all kinds of fruits, veggies etc the past few weeks with only the occasional burp. My movement is more regular and I am able to use less magnesium to keep regular, and I’ve found I no longer need caffeine to stimulate movement every day.

Compare that to when symptoms were at their worst and I couldn’t tolerate any fodmaps at all or I’d be doubled over from gas pains. At that time I also had to take 2000mg+ of magnesium and coffee every day or I’d be painfully constipated. Now I am only taking 800mg of magnesium and staying regular.

I will note that in studies on biofilm infections in rats it showed that softwave alone does not treat the infection; it was necessary to have an antibiotic along with softwave to treat the infection. In this same study the antibiotic on its own had little effect. It really is the combination that is the gamechanger; it is hypothesized that the shockwave from the softwave device breaks up the biofilm and allows the antibiotic to treat an otherwise hard to treat infection.

I am taking a little break from softwave as I’m out of the country for 6 weeks, but I do intend to continue the treatments for my abdominal adhesions. I am not sure it would be necessary if I didn’t have the adhesions and was just trying to treat Sibo; but honestly I’m my own guinea pig here and there’s no set protocol for Sibo or infections in humans.

I am sticking with the Biocidin this time in the maintenance phase to make sure it stays away this time. My ND says I need to stay in maintenance for 6+ months to really lessen the chance of recurrence, as well as working on my microbiome to strengthen it.

I will note: both Biocidin and softwave aren’t cheap, and are not covered by insurance. My softwave provider charges based on how much electricity is used by the machine, which ranges from $100-$150 a session. The Biocidin is about $70 a bottle.

Still, personally I would say both were worth it for me. I’m so happy to be able to go out to eat again without having to feel like a burden to my friends, family and the restaurant staff!!

Feel free to ask me any questions about my personal experience and I will try my best to answer; but please remember I am not a professional and can’t give you any advice for yourself. Can only talk about how things have gone for me personally.",3,1743690453.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

There’s two women who often linger in the Central Station near the depature board, and in Pelikaanstraat on the side of Panos - Capri Coffee - and the Louis Delhaize. They have a buggy with them, sometimes with sometimes without a child in it. They will approach you (kindly at first) and ask you to buy groceries for them and the baby because they “have no money”. They do this during the week usually between 2-5 pm. 

Scam tactic:

They take you to the grocery store and they start grabbing a bunch of expensive things like energy drinks. If you question them they become very hostile. They then pressure you to pay for the groceries. After you leave, they go back into the grocery store and refund the groceries for cash. 

Who do they target:

Women walking alone, and older tourists. They almost never approach men or groups. 


Description of the women:

Woman pushing the buggy
- Late 20’s, early 30’s
- 1.55m
- overweight
- pale skin, quite a bit of redness in the face
- long, wavy frizzy hair usually in a low ponytail
- Usually dressed in bodycon dressed


Woman that usually accompanies her:
- 40’s
- 1.50m
- dark hair, usually in a bun
- chubby
- Pale, dull skin
- Usually dressed very casually, sweater and jeans

Yes, it’s the same women/group that used to do this at Stadsfeestzaal.

It hasn’t happened to me, but it’s happened to lots people that I know. I’m in the station daily and they have approached me multiple times, and I see these women loitering all the time. If I have time before my train comes, I sit and observe them and they’re always using the same tactic. 

Please don’t get scammed by these people, look out for yourself and the people who are really in need 🙏🏼

If you were trying to design a policy to get 100% disapproval from economists, it would look like this. Anyone trying to backfill a coherent economic reason for these tariffs is deluding themselves. As of April 3rd, there are [tariffs on islands with zero population](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tariffs-australia-liberation-day-2054649); there are tariffs on goods like coffee [that are not set up to be made domestically;](https://usafacts.org/articles/where-does-americas-coffee-come-from/) the tariffs are comically broad, which hurts their ability to bolster domestic manufacturing, etc.

Even ignoring what is being ta riffed, the tariffs are being set haphazardly and [driving up uncertainty to historic levels](https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-cost-of-tariff-chaos). Likewise, it is impossible for Trumps goal of tariffs being a large source of revenue and a way to get domestic manufacturing back -- these are mutually exclusive (similarly, tariffs can't raise revenue and lower prices).

I’ve been texting a potential SD for about four weeks now. And previously, I was texting him on and off on SA for about 2 1/2 weeks.

We have great banter over text. And a few few weeks ago he actually sent me some money to DoorDash some food.

He would offer to get me groceries or coffee things like that.  

For the past few weeks, I’ve honestly just been waiting for him to bring up a time that we can meet or even talk on the phone. He has not done that and I’ve gotten suspicion that he gets off for me texting him. So I asked him like when can we talk on the phone? When can we do a meet and he just always says he’s super busy.

I hate when POT’s use the excuse that they’re busy. In this day and age everyone’s busy. But who are you gonna make time for? Why are you on the site looking for something you don’t even have time to meet me. And that’s what I basically told him so I gave him an ultimatum.

When you’re ready to call, let me know, but no texting in between then.

Is this too much? He has broken his boundary multiple times.

Honestly, I feel like the fact that he hasn’t asked to speak to me on the phone or do an M&G. And his excuse is that he’s too busy he has kids which I’m a nanny. I know what it’s like to be busy with kids, but it’s who you make time for it’s what you make time for.

Let me know if I dodged the bullet or if I’m overreacting I feel like if a POT doesn’t want to see you in like the two weeks you’ve been texting then it’s kind of suspicious unless they’re out of state of course.

Things have improved recently, and I’ve started therapy, but my issues have impacted my healthy relationship of three years.

I moved abroad last year. Before I arrived, I began talking to a girl (let’s call her Girl A) about general stuff like visas—nothing serious, just a bit of banter. We were both heading to the same university. After we got there, I started hanging out with her friend group (Group A) while settling in. I didn’t share full details of this with my girlfriend, though I mentioned some of the people I was spending time with. Eventually, I distanced myself from Girl A. There was no physical contact between us, just some lengthy conversations at times.

I had mentioned to Group A that I had a girlfriend, but I didn’t go into specifics. Eventually, I stopped spending time with them regularly.

Later, at a party, I spoke with another girl (Girl B from Group B). We were chatting in a corner, and I had already told her that I was in a relationship. I was also heavily drunk at this moment. Later, I found out someone from Group A had claimed I was kissing Girl B at that party. That wasn’t true. Afterward, I spoke to Girl B about this situation, we agreed we need to distance a bit and told my girlfriend, who was understandably upset and asked me to stop talking to Girl B. I agreed.

However, I still hung out with Group B. I met up with Girl B one-on-one for food or coffee a few times (maybe three), and a couple of people from her group visited my apartment once and she did too. I didn’t mention this to my girlfriend. The conversations were general—life, relationships—and I did talk a bit about my own. There was some banter, but nothing flirtatious. That said, in hindsight, there were some gray areas, like joking that may have crossed lines. I eventually stopped because I felt boundaries were being overstepped—by her and also by me.

A few months ago, I confessed everything to my girlfriend(partly due to guilt of lying and partly due to remorse), though not all at once. I told her bit by bit about both Girl A and Girl B. She was hurt each time I revealed more (which I fully understand), and I know I broke her trust. I’ve also opened up to her about our past relationship problems—how I used to feel judged when talking about my depression and trauma, how I was scared to tell her the truth, and how I avoided discussing things that hurt me. I realize now how wrong I was—not only for how I behaved around these other girls but also for not being honest in our relationship.

That said, I’ve committed myself fully to my partner. I’ve started opening up more and setting healthy boundaries. I’ve talked to her about my experiences with sexual assault, bullying, and depression. I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, though it’s improved—and she’s seen some of my panic attacks.

I’m not trying to use my trauma as an excuse. I completely own up to my mistake/crime or whatever maybe be appropriate. I am a scum for doing this but I am looking to improve. I am deeply regretful and working hard to grow and improve—for myself and as a partner. I’m in therapy now because I know I have unresolved trauma and unhealthy patterns that I need to fix.

Should I step away from this relationship to protect my girlfriend from further hurt, even though I love her deeply? Or do you think it’s possible for us to move forward? We’ve discussed everything over the past month. I asked her if she wanted to continue, and she said yes, but she understandably still has trust issues.

I'd like to test using a commercial robot for our coffee shop (around 80sqm) that vacuums and mops our floors (cement) daily.

  
What would you say is the best robot for that?

The price doesn't really matter as long as it does it's job properly.

ILL BUY YOU A COFFEE

Would anyone have 1-2 extra tickets for the CHSS degree celebration on May 16th at 9:30??? Or know anyone that would have extras.  

I was going off of the assumption that we’d have 12 (I graduated with my BS last year, MA this year) since we had 12 last year, but apparently there are only 7? People have already made plans to come down 😭 this is my MA graduation so a big deal.

I’d appreciate it 😫 PLEASE AND THANK YOU THANK YOU

I made from the coffee maker and I said it was good with the creamer. He took a sip of black coffee and said it was the worst coffee he ever had and said why couldn't I make it with the percolator in a nasty tone. I worked yesterday and sleep with the baby every night and too tired to stand there and make from percolator plus I had to had wash it and then make it. I just wanted to sit down before I spend the rest of my day doing chores. He said what? Are you upset you made dog ass coffee? Why dont you learn how to make coffee good? You also need to play with the child right now I dont feel like it. Even though I've spent 2 hours just playing with her. I told him he's nasty and being abusive and a bully. He told me why am I picking a fight with him. Isaid you upset me and being nasty. He said why dont I just shut upand sit there. Lol I was. ,36,1743689851.0,breakingmom,23,0.95,False
