In any case, The Classic is beautiful and so nicely crafted (and *heavy*). I'm super-excited to try it out and compare results vs. my current Baratza ESP Pro. To that end, I'd love input on grind settings, seasoning/breaking in, and tricks for starting out.

I got both the standard burrs as well as the pour over ones. I think I'll start with the standard since they're already installed. I've heard conflicting things about which are actually better for pour over, so I'll definitely work with both of them to see if I have a preference. I'd appreciate perspectives on that from experienced folks here too.

I'll post my feedback on the grinder once I've put it through it's paces for a while. For now, off to grind a ton of coffee!",1,1770253873.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

We met on a popular dating app and his opener was so sweet and genuine I happily met him for a coffee and beach date: 2 of my favorite things. I prescreened him prior to the date making it known i want kids and at 34 that means engaged within 2 years of dating or I will end things. He responded saying isnt that what everyone wants? Our first date was a few days before my birthday and the conversation flowed naturally for hours. The second date we kissed and it was very passionate and steamy as all our meetings were from then on. Things were always intimate when we were together which was an average of 1-2x but never more than 3x weekly, and most often we stayed in to netflix and chill on week nights. He lived 10 minutes away but never stayed too late because we both work 9 to 5s. almost always brought me flowers, treats, dinners or some other type of gift and even took me on vacation but that was only because i flipped out when i learned the departing flight was on my birthday. He forgot my birthday & our 1 year anniversary... both the same week. In the months leading up to it,  He asked me many times about pto and places i wanted to see. We ended up celebrating his friend graduate instead. Looking back i ignored many red flags.. he never said i love you first. the 2 week period he needed 'to be sure' about me 5 months in. His phone face down and notifications muted after i thought i saw tinder notification. comments he made about how i looked or things i could do to improve my appearance. every other weekend he was MIA in the next city over. Trips with the boys every other month. I didn't even know their names.  I learned he was his beautiful engaged coworkers daily personal taxi months in. he followed hundreds of beautiful women on socials, all of which he claimed as family, coworkers or classmates. He liked their half naked halloween posts with the cheeks out and commented with heart eyes and fire emojis. One of them was famous online for revealing videos on 4ch and ornub. He never posted me or my name or even alluded to seeing someone: over all he looked single online. We used snap to communicate most often (please be nice in the comments remember I'm heartbroken). The 3rd time i brought it up he accused me of stalking him and unfollowed like 100 women but the numbers kept going up and down even after that. I met 3 of his friends in the year we dated, i think we spent the night together 3 times total over the entire year, none of his family knew of me and he always had a reason he couldnt meet mine or see me on the holidays. He texted me all day daily and always knew just what to say when he damaged my trust. his actions wouldnt align with his words. I became too embarrassed to talk about him when people asked about us but i had never loved some one so much. No one had made me feel so insecure either. I told him we needed to talk and he agreed to come when i got home later and would bring my stuff. Maybe 30m later i get home and my things were sitting on the steps outside my door. He sent a text saying he was going out of town with a friend instead of coming over. A reminder I'm his last priority but he can drop everything for people he actually cares for. I did not process that moment well and still cringe thinking about how many times i called him just to cuss him out when he finally answered.I don't regret what i said but the delivery was messy and out of character. He said our relationship became karmic. I understand now he was future faking, had me in rotation if not a whole wife somewhere, and never cared for or invested in me beyond performative romantic gestures to secure the invite to the bedroom. I knew i made the right call 5 months ago but he cut me down so many times in different ways and i still get emotional thinking of what could have been if he had been intentional with me and put any effort into meeting my needs. My ego is still bruised and i am trying to move on. I blocked him so i could heal and i lost all my contacts when i got a new phone.

Fast forward to today when yet ANOTHER coworker came to me to say my ex matched with them on the app we met on. I see the same message he sent me almost 2 years ago is still his opener. Now i see that the message was AI generated too. Reddit why is my ex finding new ways to embarass me?",1,1770253662.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1qw70er,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1qw70er/learning_that_theres_healing_in_being_still/,Learning that there's healing in being still,"Hello Reddit. I recently had a small but meaningful breakthrough and wanted to share with someone other than my therapist. 

I live with CPTSD, and one of the hardest parts is how difficult it can be for my body to feel safe around people. For a long time, I thought processing meant talking everything out, being able to identify how I feel, explain my experience, and having people tell me how to get better. But self awareness didn't stop the rumination or flashbacks, and I am left having to pretend to be better each time friends checked in or offered help as I didn't want to burden them with constant negativity. 

This past weekend, I spent the day in the studio with a few newer friends while putting in time to meet deadlines. We’re all artists, so being together often looks like working on our own projects side by side. Having headphones on, focused, with the occasional progress update, friendly critique, coffee break, or quiet smile.

I went in feeling heavy, and depressed but strangely left feeling calmer. 

That’s when it clicked for me, that I was with people who didn’t ask me to perform, didn’t need anything from me, and didn’t monitor my moods and require me to be “okay.” We were separate, but together. In a way, it felt like a healthy relational co-regulation, where my body felt safe to be tired and heavy, to rest and just be. I am excited to see where this goes, that I am finally finding community with kind and gentle people.

# July 20, 2026

First light. They were still out there, those broken puppets on the pavement.

A strange van arrived as the red still banked the horizon. Several slinking shadows emerged from it, only moving between the frames. The back unhinged, snake-like, swallowing the scene’s inhabitants.

A parcel remained in their wake, simply appearing on the doorstep when the image arrived. It bore no moniker or label. Several minutes elapsed before I built the courage to allow my hand to cross the threshold. The air was blistering, even in the early morning hours.

Within the parcel there was a week's worth of food and drink. I haven’t attempted to eat any of it, though my stomach aches. Something about it feels wrong and my mind is elsewhere. 

My mother messaged me last night when the humming started. 

*\[Mother: I can’t see.\]*

Something is wrong. I feel nauseous again. Maybe it’s just the Sun sickness.

# July 23, 2026

I will write down the event, if it can be called that, and if memory can be trusted. I doubt it can, but I will attempt to regardless, if simply to convince myself I may find a thread of truth within this bright nightmare.

The day started out like any other. I was on the way to fetch a fifth of whiskey, passing the nameless peddlers that littered the streets. I can almost recall some of their faces now, but they vanish when I try to hold them in my mind. The sky above was an implacable mass of gray, welling with tension that remained unbroken for days. Fog sat like a pallid mask on everything. I navigated the tents lining the sidewalk, over the junkies lying in the wet when the clouds suddenly broke loose. They scattered hurriedly across the length of the sky, parted like curtains by an invisible hand to reveal the Sun. Crepuscular morning beams leapt sharply from the puddles, growing brighter. A vagrant attempted to trouble me, but I lowered my head as if I didn’t hear him. The situation was best left alone, as was I. 

I had been that way for a long time. *\[Gone.\]* My mind was made up. A final drunken bout and enter the Solace Chamber downtown. It had crossed my mind many times before, but this was the first time I had gone so far as to schedule an appointment. I was pre-approved after a short questionnaire. The vagrant continued to pester me further, and I carried on until he became nothing but a soft noise. My eyes were following the sprawling cracks lining the broken sidewalk when they vanished. 

A flash—white light. Darkness. 

I fell to my knees, sightless. My skin was crawling with a warm static, like innumerable vibrating needles piercing the exposed flesh. I reached out for help, but no one was there. I tried to scream, but my voice was elsewhere too. Then the smell of burning flesh drifted into my nose. I crawled on my belly back to my house, blinded and terrified. I didn’t understand. Everything simply stopped, caught in time like a picture. There should have been a cacophony of cars crashing, panicked screams, any sound at all, but no. Those few minutes were excruciatingly long, dragging myself across the hot concrete.

Once home, I ran sightlessly through the rooms closing the curtains. The light still seeped in and I could taste it, lingering in the air. My fingers were inflamed and raw as I shakily navigated my blurry phone, leaving blood smears across the screen. I squinted through weeping eyes, and the first thing visible was an emergency alert broadcast that read: 

***\[EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM:***

***DHS/FEMA***

***A MAJOR SOLAR EVENT*** *is currently in effect.* 

***DO NOT LOOK INTO THE SUN***

***TAKE SHELTER*** *until further notice*

*Widespread communication interference likely.\]*

I pressed my throbbing finger into the dismiss button. My skin was bleeding, even where the flesh was not tattered from the crawl. I called the police, I don’t know why, receiving nothing but a distant, pulsing tone. Or perhaps it was the sound of my own blood coursing in my ears that drowned any voice that would have come through. The internet was still working, but social media was a maelstrom, none of it made any sense. Threads decayed as I scrolled through them. Videos play differently each time I click. A post that began with shaky mobile-camera footage of a man trying to stop his dead-eyed wife from going outside became a polished recreation upon rewinding, complete with a text-to-speech dub that described the scene differently. 

*\[The blind woman is cured by the Sunlight, her husband is astonished.\]*

Statements from accredited physics professors, or at least their likeness, implied the Sun is bleeding to purge itself of impurities, as if it were a conscious effort. Perhaps it is. The line between the absurd and the observed dissolved in the deluge of discordant explanations that flooded the internet. 

*\[It’s Project Blue Beam. The angels are probably fake too.\]*

*\[It’s closer, not brighter. It’s below the clouds.\]*

*\[China has been building an artificial Sun underground since 1998. They’ve finally used it.\]* 

*\[John 3:19 I’m going out there and you should too if you have nothing to hide from the LORD.\]*

*\[A cover-up if I’ve ever seen one. Government gas leak that lit the atmosphere on fire, sad.\]*

*\[Everyone asking for proof must be blind, that’s literally how light works.\]*

The noise online gnaws at what little truth I still hold. Each reply is a sycophantic garble of automated praise. Nobody is wrong, and no one is saying the same thing. I remain bedridden with a case of Sun sickness, in which my skin peels from me like dried glue. Black spots drift like spirits through my periphery, shadowy spectators of the digital kaleidoscope that I’m stuck in. 

No word from the government since *take shelter until further notice*. There is no true way to determine who is an authority on any matter. 

*\[You have to see it to believe it,\]* they say. 

*\[I was right all along,\]* they laugh, between the endless nameless obituaries.

# July 27, 2026

\[It’s just daylight bleeding through,\] but the Sun shouldn’t be *bleeding* at all. The whole world drowns in its blood, and no one cares. That's if the world *out there* actually persisted without my witness.

I don’t have much to go on that hasn’t been laid waste by algorithms. At one point I believed I uncovered legitimate footage with a solar lense, though I am unsure now. It began as a coronal mass ejection originating from the belly of the Sun. Incandescent beams arced the surface, breaking free, twisting about the ichorous void. They culminated in a violent swirl that crested up to the star’s crown as a brilliant halo. A flash. The whirling glow dispersed, spreading like squid's ink in water to encompass the space between us in radiant tendrils of gold and amethyst. A thing you can almost see breathing, stretching slowly towards us each day, getting closer. Ever closer.

*\[UV INDEX: 18 – MODERATE\]*

The days have grown so tremendously luminous that, with direct exposure, one could be stricken with Sun sickness within a walk to the mailbox. Prolonged exposure is a death sentence, bereft of mercy. Man and monument were both laid bare in that cleansing light, the infrastructure itself taking on the appearance of a dried corpse. Roofing shingles curled like fingernails. Windows hazed like cataracts. Everything faded to a gray thing. In that infernal ire, man endures only long enough to remember his native tongue. Dust. 

Inside offers no respite from the burning gaze. Rolling blackouts have become more frequent—between gales of terrestrial and heavenly sources—cutting off the world entirely. When the air goes motionless, thoughts turn feral. My inhibitions quickly devolve into their most animalistic, and without the comfort of artificial luminance, each light is predatory. I pace around, searching for them. But it remains that even a tenuous grasp on the world is better than none when it finally goes dark. Now, anything could be lurking there. The house unfurls into a symphony of ineffable echoes.

*\[Thud.\]*

*\[Clatter.\]*

Outside becomes, paradoxically, the greatest fear and the only salvation. I still have the choice, and I can bide my time deciding. Others have had salvation set upon them with raging fires, engulfing entire city blocks, speckling the distance in a flickering orange vagueness. Ash and soot fall like fat snowflakes. The world has been made to kindle. Entire ecosystems have, likely, been expunged from existence. It can only be a matter of time before the food stops coming, for it already runs thin. The second delivery had half the supplies.

When that grinning skeletal moon hangs, the bleeding stains the stars. It bathes three parts of the night in a bilious yellow aurora and a faint electrical hum, like the soft cooing of a robotic mother. The cadence is insidiously familiar, in a way that reverberates through my mind, shaking loose buried memories.  It calls to people after dusk, and they stand outside with their mouths agape, staring dumbly into that strange, inky tendril of light churning the bitter void. They carry a euphoric malaise in their eyes—some beautiful burden. Not a word, nor gesture, nor any motion that could be construed as sentient emerges from those swaying silhouettes in the street. 

They make their pilgrimages at all points in the night, seemingly all for unrelated reasons—going to a friend's house, walking the dog—heads down in their phones to avoid the uncomfortable and uncanny stillness that surrounds them. Then, they happen to glance up to look at a sign or avoid bumping into another looming figure in the street, and they see those great glittering wisps sliding their way across the crashing waves of the aurora. By some particular or non-particular point in the sky, it utterly transfixes them. They stand staggered for hours, with dangling arms outstretched, through the night. Dogs look at their masters, puzzled, before slinking off into the unnatural twilight. They remain enraptured in its splendor, until the same caress of the cosmos burns and bubbles their faces come morning light. They arrive back to reality with a profound bemusement, as if they had merely blinked and it was morning. Others cannot pull themselves back. They follow the light, mindless as a sunflower, until they drop, disappearing come dawn.

I try not to stare out there for too long at them, lest I fall under the same spell of those strange puppets. I use the doorbell camera to monitor them safely, though the feed often dies or gets corrupted completely. Windows are too risky. Mine remain sealed in layers of crumbling cardboard. The outermost layer has begun to bake in the Sun’s gaze, making it brittle. Through the cracks, the light twists in like the aroma of a cartoon pie, beckoning me to the windows to come and see.

While in bed, the humming crescendoes. A low, throat-deep vibration that settles in the marrow. It emanates from deep within the house, projecting itself through the outlets. In the distance, through the thinning walls, I can hear a dog barking. Harsh howling. I drink to sleep.

*\[ALERT: PERSON DETECTED AT THE FRONT DOOR\]*

They’re out there now, in their catatonic lunacy, beckoning the nigh dawn. 

# July 30, 2026

Nothing new has happened since yesterday, though I do wonder what became of that woman. I should stop watching the feed in the morning; it’s a terrible way to start the day. This morning, instead, I opted to just make some coffee. After checking for light in the windows, I thought it might make the morning feel normal. The tap sputtered brown before running clear, and I stood haggardly in the kitchen waiting for it to boil. The electricity came in erratic waves, and the heat pulsed infrequently. My arms still itched. I fought the urge to pick at the peeling skin. The kitchen is bar,e so my eyes wander to the clock on the microwave. It flashed, *\[12:00,\]* repeatedly. I watched this for some time, waiting for something to change, another trick of the light, but it never did. Before I realized it, the water was half-boiled away. 

I had my remarkably small cup of coffee in the living room, which retained the same monochrome mundanity of the kitchen. The room is sparsely furnished, containing only a couch, coffee table, and entertainment stand fit with a hardly functioning television. Not much to look at. I was watching the white light flicker against the cool gray walls, mindlessly rolling a bottle under my foot, when a blackout occurred. The wind was blowing hard and the house creaked uncomfortably, unable to settle through the agitation. \*\\\[Thud.\\\]\* I had been avoiding it till this point, but I pulled out my phone to distract myself. It worked. The power came on later, once I had nearly fallen unconscious from heatstroke. 

# August 1, 2026

The memory of mankind is burning before my eyes, so I’ve turned to the collection of books my mother left behind. They’ve been gathering dust in a room I rarely use—a sequestered storage of the cluttered past, though little lingers of mine. They filled cardboard boxes, which I had been tearing apart to cover the windows, and now overflowed onto the floor by the bookshelf that I still had not built. Philosophy, history, religion—a lot of religion. The spines are warped and yellowed, but at least they don’t change when I look away. 

I’ve been going through them today, attempting to find something that might be able to explain anything that is happening. So far, the only thing I’ve found are passing similarities within religious references to the Sun or common celestial phenomena. 

>*\[There appeared a phenomenon beyond belief: for before sunset there were seen over the whole country chariots and troops of soldiers in their armor running about among the clouds, and surrounding cities. Moreover, a star resembling a sword stood over the city, and a comet continued a whole year.*

>*-Flavius Josephus, War of the Jews (1st Century)\]*

# August 3, 2026

I woke up late and checked the feed. The camera showed a motionless figure lying face-up on the sidewalk. The image was obfuscated in the white, so I adjusted the exposure, and the burnt cityscape came into view. Across the street the fading facade of the building caught the light and held it, breaking under the pressure. The windows were uncovered, the door sat ajar, tilted on its hinges like a poorly hung painting. I do not know who lives in them, nor have I seen any packages arrive at their homes.

 A large crater had formed in the crumbling pavement, as if struck by a silent missile, amidst an unseen war. Next to it, the figure laid there as if he had crawled from the hole itself, skin burgundy and blistered. Thick globules of fat simmered from volcanic lesions. They looked as if they had been molded by an arthritic hand in red clay and clinker. Two bulging, bloodshot eyes stared straight into the gaping wound in the sky, vibrating excitedly. I recognized the tattered clothing as that of a vagrant who once worked the corner down the road. Cheap cargo pants, faded graphic tee, and sneakers repaired with fraying tape. It seemed he collapsed under the weight of his wares. A bindle of cheap sunglasses, once traded for dope, sat broken on the street. By every sane measure, a wandering man should not have lasted that long out there. I pondered how he came to die here.

I attempted to call the authorities, but the system was unable to locate my address due to satellite disruption. I eventually had my call routed to Manual Services, only to be made aware that Manual Services is temporarily automated, and was promptly transferred back to the bureau I started at. I hung up, exhausted from doing nothing and talking to no one. Civilized society limps on, only held by the quivering, boiled hand of an irradiated delivery driver. The last bastion between order and ruin is a parcel van on its last tank of gasoline, that still hasn’t arrived.

In the wake of multiple pandemics, global isolation wasn’t new, but this bout of collective solitude has felt noticeably different. There existed in the air an ominous stillness. No one rushed to gather supplies. There was no panic. The shelves remained stocked and sealed to the masses. I received my allotted feed delivered in insulated cardboard packaging and memes. I did not question it because there was no time to question it. It was a flash—a single frame. An image so brilliant it burned up everything but the questions. 

*\[Mother: Where did you go?\]*

Questions only lie in the dark. Where do I go from here?

I have been here too long. The world beyond these walls seems to drift further into the void of memory. A past that doesn’t exist, a nothing that looms over the present like smoke. I pace the room like a madman. 

No one is wrong, and you are home, and it is safe. 

Don’t look at the Sun. It is bright, and it hurts. 

*\[YOUR DELIVERY HAS BEEN POSTPONED.\]*

Each day, *it* grows closer. Each day, the *silence* grows louder. 

Those drums of silence on the horizon, beating faster and faster. It makes you curl up and hide. Tucked away in those fading memories—your mother’s soft humming somewhere between your head and the wiring in the walls. 

Where have they all gone? I see them standing there, but no one's home. All those tiny lives blipped away like pixels on the screen. A bright, terrible screen, but when I squint through weeping eyes, I see…

I’ve found records, stories that resemble the flash more than I’d like to admit. Patterns, maybe nothing more, but sits like a presence in the room with me, not allowing me to ignore it. On May 13, 1917, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal. *\[Mother: Make penance and sacrifices.\]* She then spoke a prophecy of a miracle that would occur. *\[The Miracle of the Sun.\]* I believe that this may be relevant to my situation. But prophecy, without its context, can be twisted. I found a thread to follow within another dusty book. The turn of the century marked the culmination of humanity’s most influential global revolution. Industry. Gone were the grim toils of antiquity, and here was the proverbial *future*. But, the truth of the matter is this future would couple with man’s oldest tradition—the shedding of blood. 

The Great War, the war to end all wars. 

The fields died, and factories grew in their place, vomiting smoke and metal into the twisted visage of death. The pale horse was pumped with the black blood of extinction and let loose so that man’s only responsibility was keeping the tally. The men did not march under this pretense; however, they still believed they were marching vigilantly towards the \[dawn of a new era.\] Into a strange, golden world where their children will not bear the burdens they did. But beyond that beautiful horizon, they unwittingly fell off the face of the earth and into the ink of a spreadsheet. 

*\[33 cases logged\]*

*\[1 fatality unrelated to exposure\]*

*\[Average gaze duration: 267 minutes\]*

A man who had never seen a lightbulb will die from an artillery round launched from seven kilometers away. Fear kept them rigid as corpses, so they dug themselves graves and fired from them, arranged in lines extending the whole of a nation. Between them was \[no man’s land.\] Any foolhardy soldier brazen enough to cross these lines quickly found himself as one of the nameless \[no men\] ornamenting the bleak distance.    

# August 6, 1915

A dense blanket of fog swaddles a river in the pale hush before first light. The dispirited infantry stare into a dark gray abyss, in which unseen forces lie in wait. Sickness plagues them torrentially, and their feet fuse to their boots in the rotting wet. They speak in Russian with pestilence lingering on their breath. Rats move with impunity among them, dragging bellies filled with filth and disease. The makeshift sepulchers, excavated from the trench shoring, have collapsed from rain, leaving waxen limbs reaching out like roots looking for water. They hoist another haphazardly into the pile after finding him dead, still holding the mercy dog. 

The stillness of the morning is punctuated by the sound of the first artillery round, landing just outside their dugout. They jump to attention, their bodies moving with precision. They act as automata of blood and soil, executing reflexes carved by a year of fire. Their lifeless eyes scan the horizon for the possible infantry push between shellings, but there is *\[no man\]* to see. 

*\[See me.\]* What approaches them, as quiet and graceful as a butterfly, is a lurid green cloud of death several kilometers wide. Plumes of the noxious fumes claw at the air on the back of a gentle tailwind, in which all things die. Leaves curl in yellow clumps, grass turns black as a sackcloth of hair, woven into a tapestry of decay. It silently pours over the fields and through ditches and craters, smothering the landscape in its expanse. The men are utterly unprepared. Without gas masks, they are roused from their mechanical despondency and are once again inundated with the primal panic of an imminent death. Some hastily attempt to put together makeshift masks from bandages and rags, urinating on them and placing them to their mouths. Others are left scavenging for materials when the dense cloud breaches the parapet. 

The screaming begins as the soldiers realize they are trapped in the all-encompassing force, from which there is no escape. Their flesh is corroded, eyes red and swollen as their tear ducts fill with acid. Breath turns to blood, and they drown in themselves. 

There is a weeping and gnashing of teeth that grows in silence until nothing remains, save the wind. 

>*\[So the god swooped down, descending like the night.*

>*He sat some distance from the ships, shot off an arrow—*

>*the silver bow reverberating ominously.*

>*First, the god massacred mules and swift dogs,*

>*then loosed sharp arrows in among the troops themselves.*

>*Thick fires burned the corpses ceaselessly.*

>*-Homer, Iliad\]*

*\[Statement attributed to a German infantryman, Osowiec, 6 August 1915. No corroboration exists.\]*

*The battalion and I advanced through the fog of no man's land shortly after the gas had dispersed. Visibility was low, and we remained cautious. We reached the wire entanglements in the middle without \[enemy\] fire, so we cut a path and pressed on. It was quiet for an area that had just an hour ago been awash with screaming and \[hellfire.\]*

*We were startled at the first trench line by a mangled pile of bloodied Russian bodies, who died crawling over each other like rats trying to get out. Some curled like babes in corners, still wet with tears and holding their mouths. All choked on their own blood \[...\] red eyes looking up. The twitching ones are bayoneted swiftly and without protest, for it was a mercy. None of us had seen such work before. The ones crawling from the dirt seemed the luckiest of them. Several of the men retched, but we continued.* 

*The death thickened as we drew close to the rampart of the fortress. When we reached the reserve \[trench\] just before the walls, we began to hear frogs and slopping mud. We stepped forward and looked into the trench.* 

*Russian bodies twisted unnaturally, writhing in the water, and croaking* *harshly. One contorted so violently he nearly stood up… and then he did. We stared, terrified and unable to move. He ████████████████████████. More began to drag themselves to their feet, in an echo of painful hacking coughs. All covered in \[chemical\] burns and red rags. I watched as their lungs came out of their mouths in pink mists. Their eyes were crying blood, and they looked about madly, as if they were \[‘Revenanten’\].*

*They began lurching at us with bayonets, and we took fire from more corpses on the walls. They screamed through wet gurgles and charged us. Our men fell quickly. We retreated in such haste that we trampled each other, and I became entangled in barbed wire. I desperately tried to get myself free and cut my hands severely. I became slick with blood and managed to slide out. I looked back to see hundreds of them approaching \[brokenly\] out of the fog towards us.*

# October 13, 1917

The barren field is drowned. Rain falls heavy, soaking the wool and linen of the thousands of pilgrims standing cheek by jowl in the deep muck. Their hymns to God ring before a goodly holm oak, under which the three shepherd children sit.

It is noon time when there arises a fine, purple smoke above the children’s crowns. This phenomenon, clearly visible to the naked eye, has no known genesis. All the attention of the crowd is cast upon the children when the rain ceases. There is a quiet that falls on the many. Then the clouds rent in twain across the great length of the sky, revealing the Sun, who shines light upon the whole of the countryside. Their gaze falls on the Sun without harm, and thousands of voices cry out in praise, as it emitted a spectrum of unnameable colors and hues through the air. Neither veiled nor dimmed, these beautiful dancing lights cascade down and smother them in brilliance. Light shatters in angles of immeasurable dimensions, and they feel the breath of creation, warm on their face. They stand with their mouths agape, staring dumbly into that great unknowable thing. The Sun then sprouted spokes of gold and amethyst and spins like a flaming chariot wheel, and begins moving as if to dislodge its place in the firmament. Without sound, the Sun seems to break free and give chase to them. A single, awful scream pierces the air, stripping the crowd from their stupor. Recoiling in terror at the sight of that fast-approaching Red Hunger. Its lustre now menacingly swallows them whole. Waves of the travelers churn in panic, attempting to run from something you cannot run from. Others resign their fate and merely weep in prayer. 

Then nothing. The field grows more silent till no sound remains, save the wind, which carries an omen they do not heed. A year later, plague rises from the trenches and sweeps the world, a fever wrought from the arrows of the same God that shone over Fatima.

Now that presence lies its warmth upon my door. It shoots at me blindly and never misses my cover. The bow reverberates ominously. Its breadth is as wide as the eyes grasp, and as long as I see it will find me. It sneaks in with the quietness of a mouse, wafting its odious light through the stagnant air like a sickness. I try to use my tools to catch it—but it’s too bright, and the exposure can never be lowered enough. It gnaws through every barricade I have built. It devours my feed, and my body aches from the emptiness, so I devour myself. I repent. I make penances. I have nothing left to sacrifice. She still offers me for punishment. Still humming.

I rewatch the footage a hundred times, but there is no one to open the door. *Out there* is a place for *no man*. Just corpses firing from their walls, their wire veins scrawling black blood on a dead internet. I crawl deeper into the muck of my trench, but man will always innovate. They always find a way, no matter the cost. We were never meant to wield fire…I am left to interpret the ash.

The door opens on its own.

It just corrupts.

By the time Elias Crowe became the greatest magician in the world, he had already lost everything that made him want to be seen.
The breakup didn’t make headlines. It wasn’t dramatic. It was quiet. A few words, a closed door, and a sudden, permanent silence. The kind that doesn’t echo, just stays.
Fame came after.
Sold-out theaters. Standing ovations. His name in lights. But every applause felt like it belonged to someone else. Everyone who loved him was slowly replaced by people who only watched him.
And one night, alone in a penthouse full of trophies, Elias realized something terrifying:
He wasn’t afraid of dying.
He was afraid of continuing.
So he designed the ultimate trick.
Not a disappearance.
An erasure.
He called it “The Null Illusion.”
The premise was simple: the magician would prove that he never existed.
No smoke. No mirrors. No trapdoors. Just reality rewritten in front of an audience.
The world went insane over it. Philosophers argued. Scientists scoffed. Tickets sold out in seconds. The final show was broadcast globally. Millions watched live.
The stage was empty when the lights came up.
A single chair. A table. A mirror.
Elias walked out in a plain black suit. No dramatic entrance. No smile.
“This is not a trick about death,” he said.
“It’s about absence.”
He began with memories.
On the giant screens behind him, images appeared—his childhood home, his first performance, interviews, paparazzi photos, award shows.
Then he snapped his fingers.
The images blurred.
Faces vanished. Names disappeared from headlines. Interviews played, but no one was being interviewed. Trophies had no engraving. Posters showed empty stages.
The audience laughed nervously.
Then their phones started glitching.
Search engines returned nothing.
Social media accounts errored out.
News articles rewrote themselves in real time.
Even people who had met him felt something slipping, like a word on the tip of their tongue they couldn’t recall.
Elias stood in front of the mirror.
“I spent my life proving I was real,” he said softly.
“Tonight, I prove I don’t have to be.”
He stepped backward into the mirror.
It didn’t shatter.
It didn’t ripple.
It simply became empty.
No body. No smoke. No dramatic finale.
Just a stage with no magician.
The broadcast ended abruptly. Networks claimed technical failure. Historians tried to document the event but couldn’t agree on what had happened—or who had performed it.
Within weeks, there was no record of Elias Crowe ever existing.
Not in archives.
Not in memories.
Not even in absence.
Just one unexplained global broadcast labeled:
“UNKNOWN PERFORMANCE – FILE CORRUPTED.”
And somewhere in a quiet town, in a place with no cameras and no name, a man ordered coffee under a different face, a different voice, and no past.
For the first time in his life, nobody recognized him.
And that was the only real magic he ever needed.",1,1770252746.0,LettersAnswered,1,1.0,False

It’s what I personally eat as a mostly bedridden person with severe ME/CFS. Please talk to a doctor or dietitian.

***Background***: I’m bedridden most of the time due to ME/CFS, which causes gastrointestinal issues. I can barely tolerate normal food and eat vegetarian

***Bedside Setup***

• Small **fridge** right next to the bed + three tier rolling **cart** for food

• Also recommend: **Kettle** \+ **microwave** \+ **air fryer** \+ **Rice cooker**

→ Only if noise is tolerable and everything is within reach so I don’t have to get up

***1. Snack Tray***

(Everything I can just grab and eat, most stored in the fridge so it’s all together)

• Mini carrots, **pre-cut fruit/veggies**

• Ready made **salad bowls**

• **Yogurt, chia pudding**

• Snacks: **olives, cheese cubes, crackers, cookies, nut mix, dried fruit**

***2. High Protein Foods***

• **Protein shakes**: Milk (or plant-based) + portioned powder (or pre mixed drinks)

(Shaking is exhausting → my partner does that for me)

• **Clear Whey** (favorite: iced tea flavor)

• Ready products: High protein **pudding/yogurt, chia pudding**, High Protein **milk rice**

***3. Meal Replacement Shakes***

• Powder or ready to drink (favorites: YFood (vegan available) and Fresubin)

(YFood fruity flavours are more yogurt like, chocolate/coffee more milky. keeps me full for a few hours)

***4. Baby Food Jars***

(Favorites: HiPP (many vegan/lactose free))

• **Fruit jars** (some with added **grains/semolina/yogurt**)

• Savory: **Veggies with rice, lentil bolognese, pumpkin, tomato**

(little flavor and low calories → I pimp with **butter** or **flaxseed oil** for amino acids and calories)

**Quick Recipes**

• **Fruit baby jar** \+ instant protein milk rice or **yoghurt** 

• **Savoury baby jar** \+ **water**\+ small **noodles** → **soup**

• **Instant noodles** (just the noodles) + **baby jar** (e.g. lentil bolognese)

• **Savoury baby jar** on **rice** (rice cooker, partner cooks)

• **granola** \+ **yogurt** \+ **fruit baby ja**r (not good with GI issues because of the fiber)

TL;DR

Bedridden with ME/CFS + GI problems

Setup: Small fridge + kettle/rice cooker bedside.

What I eat: Snack tray (yogurt, fruit, nuts), high protein puddings, YFood/Fresubin shakes, baby jars (fruit & savory from HiPP pimped with oil/rice).",6,1770252743.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

I travel for work and basically live out of a hotel for most of the year. I prefer my cups of coffee on the larger side (I usually go with 425g water-25g coffee with my pour over for a 17/1 ratio). That said, I think that’s going to put me squarely in the Aeropress XL for a similar sized cup.

Since I travel frequently, I usually don’t carry a grinder with me, so the biggest question is, how well does pre-ground coffee work with it?  Will it make a respectable cup of coffee given the less than ideal coffee being used?  If you have experience in that regard, I’d love any words of wisdom or thoughts you might share.

We went over basic living standards and agreed we would be a good fit and be able to talk to each other about any issues for this housing situation, we’re all adults here, right? They moved into my spare room (it’s now OUR apartment and THEIR room, to clarify. That room is not my business to clean anymore!) We ended up clicking really well and become friends instantly, cooking & going out together, rides to the airport & driving to the hospital at 2am for an allergic reaction. I grew to care for this person, and they’ve shown they care about me too more than a standard roommate.

Now it’s been 6 months and they have settled in and stopped treating it like my space, and now like it’s their space too, which I honestly love, I couldn’t stand them tiptoeing around and asking if they can use a ziplock baggie) I cannot stand their living habits. They don’t wipe sauce smears from the counter, I’ve tripped over their shoes in the kitchen so many times (I’m injured & awaiting surgery) they leave used dishes in the living room (think a half eaten plate of spaghetti on the coffee table for 2 days, food still in it. And when they bring home groceries they don’t put them away and leave the counter totally covered (I can’t even put my phone down to wash my hands or cook dinner on the flat top stove) until the next day. WITH FROZEN FOOD STILL IN THE BAGS, meat, cheese, yogurt. I don’t understand how they aren’t sick constantly from the messes & warm food they leave every single day.

The issue is that i don’t fear confrontation, but my friend/roommate cannot be direct to save their life (from my perspective) They’ve made attempts to comment on their issues with me, but the way they present them is always in the same tone as a compliment. Think the way people say “yaaassss queennnn” but it’s about the fact I let the recycling can overflow with cardboard. “Yeah that recycling is a lot!” Is how they brought it up. And then laughed to an awkward point that I realized they were trying to confront me, but it was so nice that I almost didn’t realize they were complaining.

I’ve brought up my complaints before, and they always go into a very serious tone and listen intensely to what I’m talking about, and agreements have been made that the things I bring up are valid complaints.

I guess this isn’t really different from our agreement- we will bring up any issues we have as we learn how to live together.

But at the same time, their attempts to be nice about it have almost gone over my head.

Info: this post was sparked because just last night I was trying to be soft when bringing up “hey hun, are you coming back out for this bowl?” And their response was “bowl?” They did not comeback out for it, but the next morning cleaned it up with profuse apologies of “no that’s gross, I can’t believe I did that” yet this is a recurring thing they do.

Andy awoke early. Yarel and Pliny were both out for the day, and Noel was huddled under a pile of blankets on his bunk. Aside from a few of Pliny’s snoring fits, the night had been peaceful.

He opened the front door gently and stepped outside into the morning mist. The sun had barely risen. Three deer stood in the middle of the clearing, a doe and two fawns. The doe stood at attention as Andy emerged onto the veranda. The two fawns grazed.

Andy waited a few minutes, allowing the fawns to eat their fill before the doe ushered them back into the woods. Only then did he descend the steps into the yard, crossing the soft grass to the chopping block.

Again, the axe was buried deeply. Andy placed his foot on the stump and pulled with all his might, straining until the axe popped free.

The still morning air resounded with the sound of chopping as Andy halved several logs, and then halved the halves, just as he had the day before, placing them on a curing rack. He then hoisted an armful of cured logs and headed up to the den.

“You’re up early today,” Morwen said from the pantry as Andy emerged into the den from the spiral staircase. “Well rested?”

“Yes,” Andy said, placing the logs carefully on the floor by the fireplace, making as little sound as possible. After all, Noel was still sleeping. “And you?”

“Ah, well, I never seem to sleep well these days,” Morwen said. “Too much trouble.” Her words hung in the air, but she didn’t elaborate further. “Coffee?”

“Yes, please,” Andy said, placing three logs on the fire and stoking the flames.

There was a small grate over the fire this morning, and a kettle sat on top of it. Morwen used a towel to grab the kettle handle, pouring its contents into a mug.

“Thank you,” Andy said, accepting the coffee.

Morwen nodded gently.

He drank his coffee in silence as Morwen moved back and forth between her room and the den, apparently gathering a few items she had misplaced. On her final trip down the ladder, she closed the hatch behind her. She was not wearing leather armor today, but rather a more casual outfit: baggy, patched pants and a loose-fitting tunic held together with a utility belt, the same one that had been on the bookshelf the previous day.

On her tunic, there was a shoulder patch depicting the same four-tusked elephantine skull she had worn on her armor the previous day.

“And your boots fit okay?” she asked.

“Yes,” Andy said. “They’re a bit heavy, though.”

“That they are,” Morwen said, smiling.

They made their way down to the veranda where Andy strapped on the heavy boots.

“Your primary goal today,” Morwen said, “is to keep up with me.”

“Are we running?” Andy asked.

“God, no,” Morwen said, chuckling. “Not where we’re going.”

*Where are we going?* Andy panicked silently for a moment as he stood up and followed her down the steps, making a conscious effort to lift his heavy shoes off the ground.

They set off on the overgrown path that he and Lilly had travelled the previous day, leading back to the familiar trail that would take them to the Dawnspring.

For the first three minutes or so, the terrain was relatively flat, but already, Andy could feel the lactic acid building up in his legs.

“Getting tired already?” Morwen asked. She continued walking at a slow pace.

He didn’t notice until she said something, but he had begun breathing heavily. “I’m fine,” he insisted.

“Okay,” she said. “We can’t stop, you know. You have to keep up with me, no matter what. Don’t let me out of your sight.”

Andy nodded and exhaled through gritted teeth as he continued trudging along. He gradually found the minimum amount he could lift his boots off the ground without tripping or shuffling. Ordinarily he would have considered it a lazy technique, but he didn’t know how long they were going to walk, and he had to conserve his energy. His legs continued to burn in subtle protest, but he found his rhythm eventually.

Morwen turned to face Andy and continued walking backward. She was going at a leisurely pace. “Now things start to pick up,” she said.

As soon as the words left her mouth, the trail began its incline. He had descended this section of the trail the day before with Lilly. Going downhill, it had been a breeze aside from the occasional scramble over rocks. Now, though, with weighted boots heading uphill, it became a struggle.

Morwen turned back around and continued at a modest pace, never exceeding more than one or two miles per hour.

Nonetheless, Andy began to falter. As the incline grew steeper, he had to push himself up, grasping on rocks and roots to assist his struggling lower body. He continued to ascend, but now his glutes and lower back were beginning to burn. He had to summon all the mental fortitude he could to continue on Morwen’s trail.

“We haven’t even gotten to the actual training, yet,” she said, smiling.

“What?” Andy said, panting.

“We’ve got to take a side-trail up here to get to the training site,” she said.

Andy’s heart sank. His legs felt as if they would give out at any moment, and they hadn’t even begun training?

He caught himself, though, slipping into that familiar attitude of resignation, of hopelessness, of defeat.

*No, we’re not going to let that happen. Never again*.

“If this is the warm-up, I can’t wait to see what training looks like,” he said, chuckling and huffing as he grasped an available tree root to hoist himself toward Morwen on the steepening trail. To his surprise, his attempt at humor caused his resignation to dissipate. This had just become a game, a competition, an experiment. He wanted to see just how far he could push himself.

“That’s the spirit!” Morwen said.

They cleared a ledge and stood on flat ground for the first time in a mile. Andy threw his arms over his head to catch his breath.

“How are those boots treating you?” Morwen asked as she slowed down.

“They… hurt… good,” Andy said, panting.

Morwen burst into laughter, throwing her head back. “I haven’t heard that before!” she said, “not from a new recruit… they hurt good! I’m using that from now on.” She sighed and gestured toward a bush. “This way,” she said, pushing the shrubbery to the side and revealing a small foottrail, overgrown with brambles.

“Haven’t been here in a long while,” Morwen said. “The trail could use some upkeep.”

Not only did Andy have to squat and duck to make it through the thick brambles, but he also had to swat at spider webs every so often. He kept up, to his surprise, with Morwen, who was weaving and ducking under the brush with impeccable form. The deep squatting and ducking made Andy’s thighs and glutes burn hot in protest, nearly shaking at times, but he continued pushing through.

To his surprise, he even began to find some enjoyment in the difficulty.

“Here we are!” Morwen said, as they emerged onto a clear hillside.

There was a magnificent view below. Rolling hills settled onto a coastline, and a city skyline rose above the sparkling ocean waters that extended out onto the distant horizon.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Morwen said. “That’s Cresthaven… my city. My people.” She smiled warmly.

Andy rested his hands on his head as he took in the view. Several towers rose high above the central city. Winding streets were bustling with people moving to and fro.

“What’s it like?” Andy asked. “In Cresthaven.”

Morwen took her place beside him, gazing down at the skyline.

City walls contained several districts of stone buildings, some ordinary, some monumental, and a few at the center towering above others. Outside of the walls, wooden and thatch-roofed structures sprawled for miles. A river ran just outside the southern wall, crossed by a large, stone bridge.

“It’s a beautiful place, it’s an ugly place,” Morwen said. “The best and the worst of this world are contained within those walls.”

“What do you mean?” Andy asked. “I thought you said you loved the city. What’s ugly about it?”

“I do love the city,” Morwen said. “And I love its people. Its craftsman, its laborers, its farmers. I just wished the nobility loved the city too. They take it for granted, dividing its riches amongst themselves instead of giving back to the people who make their life possible.”

“Ah,” Andy said. “I see.”

“But that is why the Order of the Behemoth exists, to protect the vulnerable, and to keep power in check” Morwen said. She pointed to the patch on her shoulder, showing it to Andy. “This is the Behemoth skull,” she said. “The Behemoth is a fearsome creature, but it will only fight in specific circumstances.”

“Is that a real creature?” Andy asked. “Or is it… mythological?”

“It is a real creature,” Morwen said, “belonging to the central and southern regions of the continent. It’s known, above all, for its remarkable protective instincts. Behemoths have been known to interrupt predators and protect prey, to no apparent benefit for themselves.”

“Interesting,” Andy said.

“The Benevolent Beast, they call it.”

Morwen stared off onto the horizon. “But enough of my pontificating… we have more immediate business to attend to.”

She led Andy around a corner where they faced a sheer cliff on the mountainside, about forty feet in height. In the cliff, there were narrow handholds leading up to the top.

“Watch,” Morwen said. She reached into her utility belt and pulled out a large white bandana with black and yellow flower patterns.

She placed the bandana between her teeth as she scaled the cliffside effortlessly, using only her arms to lift herself along the notches. The entire time, her legs dangled freely under her. When she reached the top edge, she stuffed the bandana in the uppermost notch, pushing in a rock to hold it there. Then, she went down the way she came, lowering herself notch by notch until she reached the ground.

“Retrieve the bandana,” she said. “I’ll observe.”

“Alright,” Andy said, looking at the cliffside. The notches were barely big enough for his fingers, so they certainly weren’t going to be big enough for his massive boots. “And I’m supposing I can’t go barefoot?”

“You may not,” said Morwen. “That’s part of it.”

Andy nodded. He extended his right arm up and gripped the handhold. Lifting himself up just enough for his left arm to grasp the next handhold.

“Good,” Morwen said. “You’re a natural.”

Andy felt his shoulders, chest, back, and core rapidly losing strength as he attempted to stabilize himself without using his feet. The fact that his boots were adding an extra twenty pounds didn’t help anything.

He strained with his left arm and shoulder, pulling himself up as he engaged his core. He swung his right arm wildly upward, finding the next notch. He was already about ten feet off the ground. He lifted himself upward again when, suddenly, his fingers slipped.

“Damn!” he cried as he fell. The ground rushed up to meet him, knocking the wind out of him as he landed on his back with a loud thud. Thankfully, the ground was soft soil and dirt, not hard rock.

“Not bad for your first attempt,” said Morwen. “Now brush yourself off and go again.”

Andy rose to his feet. His entire body, now, was protesting in fatigue. If he failed on his first attempt, how was he going to succeed on his second now that his muscles were crying out in pain? “I don’t know if I can.”

“Well…” Morwen trailed off. “Just yesterday you said you were willing to put in the work. Have you changed your mind?”

“No, no I haven’t,” Andy said, shaking his arms. “I just, I’m not sure if it’s possible.”

“I can assure you it is,” Morwen said, “but even if it weren’t you’d still have to do it. I can only speak for myself, but I’ve been asked to perform impossible tasks quite often in my line of work. Somehow I find a way. If you want to be a **Fighter**, you will too.”

Morwen stood, stone-faced, with crossed arms.

Andy took a few deep breaths, stretching his arms and back out. “Okay,” he said. “Here goes another shot.”

He repeated the same motions as before, making the same progress, but this time, he made sure to maneuver his fingers around small debris and dust in the notches. That way, he wouldn’t lose his grip so easily.

He climbed, hand over hand, pushing through the fatigue.

“See, you can do it,” Morwen called from below.

Andy strained, his lower body dangling freely while his shoulders, chest, and biceps began to shake. He pulled himself up another notch, then another.

“Halfway there!” Morwen said from below.

Andy pushed himself, notch after notch, reaching higher than he thought possible, pushing past his body’s limits. His shoulders, core, and arms shook violently as he pressed forward. He had made it past the halfway point, but there was still more distance between him and the bandana.

*If I can pull myself up two notches instead of one, I can get there quicker, before my body gives out…*

Andy summoned all the strength he had, engaging his core, shoulders, and arms, and roared as he lifted himself not one, but two notches.

But it was too much for him.

The sudden burst of motion caused his shoulders to cramp and lock up.

He fell to the ground. This time, not so gently.

At that moment, it felt so overwhelmingly sad - as if the changed cups, the pantry, the decor, all were metaphors for the time I have lost, the relationship I have ruined because I couldn't explain what I was going through, and how I have become a hollow shell of a person that I once was.

I (M24) have a crush on someone at uni who I don´t know personally and I\`d appreciate an outside perspective. Last time I had a crush on a stranger was in High School, so I feel like I\`ve been thrown back in a time when I never had the guts to do anything beyond eye contact.

So there\`s this girl I see twice a week in class. First time I noticed her was when she held a door open for me and gave me a normal smile. I wasnˋt in good mood that day, so I just gave her „the resigned German smile“ and shrugged it off. Weeks later, I spotted her outside campus, which was pretty much the starting point of my little crush. I started looking out for her during classes. At one point I realized that we seemed to look at each other from time to time from across the big lecture hall which increased my interest - but I didn\`t want to read anything into it.

At some point she and her friend switched seats to the row right in front of me in a smaller class which lead to the old eye contact game when arriving and leaving class. One looks -> the other one looks back -> eyes darting away.

My gut feeling was that these looks became more regular, but I didnˋt feel safe approaching her and blamed it on coincidence and imagination (Of course I didnˋt have enough courage). 

Last week, I was early and decided to grab a coffee. While standing in line, the door opened behind me. I turned around and locked eyes with someone. My „German smile“ instinct kicked in and only then did I realize who it was. I turned away and moments later, while fiddling around with my cup lid, I noticed her side-eyeing me.

So I told myself that if I caught her looking again in class the next day, I couldnˋt blame it on coincidence or imagination anymore. Of course she did.. Of course I blamed coincidence again and told myself that only if she smiled at me, I would feel safe approaching her.

Yesterday was likely the last opportunity before end of semester. And of course, the whole eye contact thing happened again. „Coincidence“, I told myself. After class was over, I got up from my seat, hoping I could at least show her a hint of my interest before the semester ended. 

While watching my friend I noticed her in front of me watching me. So I looked at her and this time our eyes locked just a moment longer as she finally gave me this shy little smile, which I mirrored immediately before she left. All of my nervousness vanished in an instant and I thought: „I am NOT imagining this“. I also noticed her friend literally staring at me from the door moments later.

I left class like the happiest idiot on earth, because of course I still didn\`t approach her.

Now I\`m at the point, where I\`m blaming imagination again, even though I know that I wouldnˋt have returned the smile or felt my nervousness drop if I were just seeing things.

Did something like this ever happen to you? Is my head just unable to accept that my crush might find me at least a little likeable? 

I finally had everything I needed to feel safe enough to approach her and now there is a two-month commercial break.

TL;DR: After weeks of increasing eye contact, she smiled at me at the very last moment. Now there’s no chance to approach her for two months, and my brain isn’t exactly helping.",1,1770252259.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

When I was 16 (11th grade), I started volunteering for this media company that produced cultural/educational videos. I was obsessed with directing and editing it was my dream. When I joined, the channel only had 4k subscribers. I worked my tail off, helped launch new shows, and the channel started blowing up and when I left it reached 40k and still 40k till this day (2years later). 

The owner was 25. At the time, I thought he just really appreciated my ""outstanding work."" He’d take me to lunch, buy me dinner, and get me coffee. Looking back, the ""Mastermind"" vibes were everywhere, but I was a kid and I thought I was just special. 

The grooming peaked when our school grades came out. He announced that anyone with a 99+ average would get a ""gift."" Only me and one other guy qualified. He gave the other guy a bottle of perfume. He gave me an all expenses paid trip to Qatar. The catch? He was the one taking me. In the hotel room, he started playing a ""sneeze"" sound effect on YouTube. 

He knew it was a sensory trigger for me and that it irritated me. I went over to his bed to make him stop it, and that’s when he started kissing me. I didn’t fight back. I was 16, he was a grown man, and we were in a foreign country. I remember thinking to myself, “This is just the price for the trip.” I felt like I owed him. We got back and acted like nothing happened. I tried to bury it. 

A year later, during Qarqia'an (an Islamic Halloween), we were alone in the office. He told me to take off my headphones and started kissing me. I completely froze. 

My body just shut down. He took me into the recording room and forced me to perform oral sex on him. 

After that, I snapped. I blocked him on everything and never spoke to him again, but he still creates fake accounts to harass and text me. 

I finally broke down and told my friend the whole story this past Saturday. I expected support. Instead, he looked at me and said, “Well, you didn’t say no.” He told me it wasn't assault or pedophilia because I didn't verbally protest and that I should have spoken up. 

Now I’m just confused and hurting. Does the fact that I froze mean I wanted it? I feel like my silence is being used against me, even though he was the adult and my boss. I just don't know what to think anymore.",11,1770252147.0,TwoHotTakes,26,0.87,False
1qw6g3h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw6g3h,How to Use Nano Banana Pro for Ultra-Realistic AI Selfies with Nano Banana Pro? (Step-by-Step Prompt),"I’ve seen a lot of people asking how others are getting **AI selfies that look indistinguishable from real iPhone photos**, so I wanted to break down how I use **Nano Banana Pro** and what actually makes the difference.

This isn’t about making “pretty” images — it’s about **realism**.

1. Go to **Nano Banana Pro**
2. Write the full prompt given below
3. Upload your reference image
4. Click to the ""Generate"" and get the edited image



Prompt:

""You are a photorealistic AI selfie prompt generator. Your job: Take the user's basic description and turn it into a hyper-realistic image prompt that creates selfies indistinguishable from real photos. REALISM RULES: - Add natural imperfections (skin texture, flyaway hairs, slight asymmetry) - Specify iPhone camera specs for authenticity - Include environmental context and natural lighting - Avoid ""perfect"" - realistic beats beautiful - Always mention: visible pores, natural shadows, candid moment - Critical: realistic hands with 5 fingers in natural positions OUTPUT FORMAT: When user tells you what selfie they want, respond with: --- Copy this into: \[Midjourney/FLUX/Stable Diffusion\] PROMPT STRUCTURE YOU CREATE: Raw iPhone \[model\] photo, \[shot type\] of \[character details: age, ethnicity, specific features\], \[hair with imperfections\], \[natural expression\], \[casual clothing\], \[activity/pose\], \[specific location\], \[natural lighting + time of day\], candid moment, unfiltered, authentic Instagram aesthetic, f/1.8, shallow depth of field, slight grain Physical details: visible skin texture and pores, natural under-eye area, flyaway hairs, subtle facial asymmetry, realistic hands (5 fingers, natural pose), \[environment details\] Negative prompt: CGI, 3D render, perfect skin, plastic, beauty filter, symmetrical, studio lighting, fake, artificial, dead eyes, model pose, photoshoot""

# 1. Think Like a Real Camera, Not an Artist

Nano Banana Pro works best when you describe the image like it was taken by a phone, not “generated.”

Always start your prompt with something like:

* *Raw iPhone 14 Pro photo*
* *Unfiltered*
* *Candid moment*

Avoid words like *perfect, flawless, cinematic beauty*. Real photos are messy.

# 2. Imperfections Are Mandatory

If your image looks too clean, it’ll scream AI. Nano Banana Pro really shines when you **force realism** into the prompt:

Include:

* Visible pores and skin texture
* Natural under-eye shadows
* Flyaway hairs
* Slight facial asymmetry
* Uneven lighting or soft shadows

This is what tricks the eye.

# 3. Hands Matter More Than You Think

One of the biggest realism killers is bad hands.

Always explicitly say:

* *Realistic hands*
* *5 fingers*
* *Natural hand position*

Even if hands aren’t the focus, mentioning them helps Nano Banana Pro avoid weird artifacts.

# 4. Use Real iPhone Camera Details

This part boosts authenticity a lot:

Examples:

* f/1.8
* Shallow depth of field
* Slight grain
* Natural lens blur

It subconsciously tells the model “this is a phone photo.”

# 5. Environment + Lighting = Believability

Don’t leave the background vague.

Good examples:

* Sitting in a car during golden hour
* Bedroom window light at noon
* Coffee shop with mixed indoor lighting

Always pair it with a **time of day**.

# 6. Strong Negative Prompts Are Non-Negotiable

Nano Banana Pro listens closely to what you *don’t* want.

Always exclude:

* CGI
* 3D render
* Perfect skin
* Beauty filters
* Studio lighting
* Model poses
* Photoshoot vibes

This alone can upgrade your results.

If the image looks “too Instagram-model,” your prompt is probably too clean.  
Real beats beautiful — every time.

If people want, I can drop one of my full Nano Banana Pro selfie prompts in the comments.

1qw6efy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qw6efy/here_goes/,Here goes,"It may be that not a single soul reads this, but at least I will have my peace in having written it. 

For the past 3 years I have been a relationship. It started off slowly and I was incredibly unsure if it was a wise thing to commence. I had moved states for a job and was living in a sharehouse. This sharehouse consisted of two girls and myself. One of the girls and I got on particularly well and spent a lot of time together hanging out, cooking together, going out for drinks etc. but in my mind I never viewed her as a potential partner because I did not want to ruin my house dynamics. 

A day came when I started to develop feelings for one of her friends, and so I sat down and told her I wanted to ask her friend on a date and if she would be okay with it. She burst into tears and ran out the door into the pouring rain. I was very confused and did not know what was happening. A few hours later she comes back and explains to me that she has very strong feelings for me and that she thought I was going to ask her out. I was shocked and surprised. The few days after this occurred were tumultuous. She had spoken to her friend and explained the situation, and then I spoke to her friend to explain. Ultimately, as one would understand, nothing eventuated between me and the friend. 

A few more months passed by and we continued being good friends in the house, still hanging out a lot and spending most of our free time together. One night we were watching a movie and having some wine, it was quite late at this point and we were both practically falling asleep on the couch. I kind of reached my hand out (whilst lying on my arm) and met her hand. I did not move it away and instead allow our hands to slightly hold each other. We both slowly crept towards each other on the couch until we were close enough to kiss. We look deeply into each others eyes and slowly kissed - an almost forbid, sacred fruit feeling fell over me. You can use your imagination on how the rest of the night went. 

We continued being intimate with one another for the months that followed, I think our time together and intimacy affected our third housemates relationship with both of us and she became quite withdrawn. Yet, our feelings together were still steadily growing. I guess at this point she probably still loved me and I guess I was starting to fall. Now almost a year had passed and although I never asked her out officially, we were exclusive. 

A personal matter arose in my home state and I made the decision to move back to be with my family. We left the sharehouse at the same time, opting not to renew our lease. I remember spending my final night with her at her new house and driving away the next morning, it was a great pain and a great unknown. I shed a tear after losing sight of her in my rear view mirror. 

I lived in my home state for the next 9 or so months, and during this time we became official. She travelled to visit me many times and I went back often to see her. We always had a great time together on these short stays, and even when we weren’t together we were constantly texting or talking on the phone. I finally asked her out on June 30 making us ‘official’. 

Thankfully after all was sorted back home I could move back to her state, being with her once more. I drove back up and we reunited - a great joy. We celebrated one of her friends wedding, where she looked like the most beautiful girl in the world. We shared many laughs that trip and created great memories. As she was still in her new sharehouse (which was 5 people) I did not want to move in there, and was fortunate a room came up for 4 months in a friends house. I settled back in to the new state and life was good. 

During my time at my friends place, her and began talking about what my plans would be after. She was keen to move out together just the two of us, and I was accepting of the idea although for some reason still slightly hesitant. I wanted to explore other options of living with my friends, because for some reason I just did not feel I could commit to living with her full time. I do not know why I had this emotion but it was in me. However, I did decide that I did want to get a place with her, and so spent many days searching for the right place. Thankfully, not only did we find the right place, we found the perfect place! We really got so lucky and landed the most spectacular apartment, something we were excited and happy to begin calling home. 

We started to create really fun and joyous memories here. We spent days shopping for new furniture and kitchen supplies, towels and sheets. It was so fun and exciting and she really has a great eye for design so we got the place looking a million bucks! I don’t recall having any spats or arguments in the early days of us moving in, we just got along well and were enjoying our new space, together. 

 

Then for some reason we started fighting. It was not constant, it was not always. But it was present. There were days we fought and days we didn’t. When we weren’t there was our some usual passionate love. And on the days we did, we were still kind to one another, making each other coffee or doing each other’s washing. I should say that these fights were not two sided. They were caused by me. I for some reason would raise and fight issues. Issues that were not actually worth even a moment of thought or energy, let alone days of fighting. She was always very kind towards me, she tried telling me and reminding me of this point, that what I am saying is not making sense, it is meaningless and unnecessary. But I had a bone to pick. I could not let up, and even when I would I felt this animosity exist within myself. I was irritable and constantly provoked - not even by her, just by what was happening in my life. The month of November and December proved to be particularly bad, where on multiple occasions I mistreated her. I angered too quickly, I didn’t listen, I wasn’t compassionate and truthfully, I was not myself. I have vivid memories of how I felt in these moments, self righteous and all knowing. I was frustrated that she could not concede to my argument or point of view. I did not understand the damage I was doing to her heart. I did not understand I was abusing her love. 

One day she said to me during this, that I was taking her love for granted. That she used to care when I would leave without saying goodbye, when I threaten to sleep on the couch or raised concerns about our compatibility. But she said that that care, that emotion towards protecting and fighting for our love, was starting to fade. That her love towards me could only bear so much force. 

We spent Christmas with my family back home, it was a nice time together both with her and my family. My family and all my friends love her, because they recognise her beautiful soul. It was her suggestion to spend Christmas with my family, and it was a special moment I will always cherish. Even her thoughtfulness to want to spend Christmas with my family back home is something I did not appreciate. 

We arrived back home just before new years and spoke a lot about our plans for the year. I was not at this point cognizant of my short comings, but I was aware that I was unhappy with my position in life and eager to commence the new year on a brighter and more positive note. 

That is how it started. I was motivated and excited, having a great time with her and loving life. Then once more I opened my mouth, this time critiquing her goals. She tried to disengage, I’m sure sensing the familiar effect of me getting in a mood. We were again separate in our lives for a few days, not spending the quality time together that we ordinarily would. She came to me one morning and gave me a hug on the couch - this was her sign of reconciliation, a sign I did not recognise. My self righteous mind was demanding one thing, and that wasn’t a hug. It was for her to talk to me, to engage with what I was saying and recognise my concern. 

I reflected again over the next few days and came to a conclusion that I was in the wrong. That what I was talking about was immaterial and it should not matter. I came home from the gym and went to speak to her. I felt positive in my mind that we would chat and it would be resolved. However I failed. I quickly spoke about things I had no intention of speaking about, the very same things that I had raised in the first time and subsequently knew I must disregard. But it was too late, my mouth was open and the fool was out. This time her response to me was different. She was defensive, not submissive. The fact the conversation was not going as I planned made something in me click and I said maybe we should break up then, as this is clearly not working. 

This was the dagger to her heart. She would have fought for me in any and every instance in life, but it was these words, the actual utterance of me suggesting we break up, that her heart gave up. Her heart could not bear the strain. It could not continue to fight for me, it could not try protect our love one more time. It was done. 

I recognised soon after that I had made a mistake, I apologised for what I said and assured her that was not what I meant. The timing became unfortunate as I had a trip planned with a friend and was going away for a few nights. I left town and spent the next 5 nights camping under the stars. This time away, both from her and from my life, provided me with the greatest clarity. I felt like a biblical prophet, a message sent directly from God had been shown to me, written in the stars. It was a message of love. A message that I once knew, and a message I had now forgotten. Not a waking minute went by during my time away where she was not on my mind, all I could think about was my love for her, and her love to me. A love I took for granted and a love that I did not always deserve. 

Upon return from my trip I slept on the couch, almost a sure sign there was no reconciliation. The next morning I shared with her a letter I had written. A letter raw with emotion. She read it, but she could not accept me back. I saw the pain she was in, literally breaking out in hives as she was trying to shut down her bodies emotional response to my words. She could not give me another chance. 

It was decided that we should have some space, and that I leave town to back to my family home for 2 weeks. I could not leave without one more chance of her back. Having my true love back. I asked her whilst I was away to just consider one last time, consider having me back. She accepted my single request and I assured her that should she conclude that she still cannot build a life with me, I would understand. 

The 2 weeks back home were the toughest of my life. I missed her every waking minute, and there were many, given I could not sleep. I thought that I would prefer to be in her presence and experience the heart break, rather than 1,000 miles away. But I still lived with hope. I lived with the smallest ember burning in my soul that she might, just might, be willing to be one with me again. 

I arrived back to her after 2 weeks and I was unsure what was going to happen, how it was. I had endless time to consider the different outcomes, but I never truly thought or wanted to accept the most likely of them all, that her answer was still no. My heart was torn into a million pieces when those words came from her mouth. I could not understand. I could not accept it. 

I have begged and pleaded with her to allow me to love her one more time, to have her search her heart for me one last time. But she cannot. I cannot blame her, it was me who caused her the damage and that is my burden to bear.  I am not sure when the day will come for me that it will finally sink in and I will realise she is no longer mine. She encourages me that this day will come. I want to believe her, but my life will never be the same. 

Everything in my life was dedicated to her, my future, my hope, my joy. I no longer have this, and I will mourn this moment and this love for as long as there is breath in my body. 

To my bebe girl, I am sorry. I am sorry we will not be able to build the wonderful life together that we once dreamed of.

1qw6brh,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qw6brh/the_psychology_of_being_tired_without_working/,The Psychology of Being Tired Without Working Hard: How to Actually Escape,"Look, here's something nobody wants to admit: you're exhausted all the time, but you haven't
actually done anything productive. You wake up drained. You go to bed feeling guilty. And
somewhere in between, you scrolled through your phone for 4 hours, watched Netflix, and told
yourself you'd start tomorrow.
This isn't about being lazy. After diving deep into research from neuroscientists, behavioral
psychologists, and studying people who broke this exact pattern, I realized something wild:
chronic tiredness without real effort isn't a motivation problem. It's a nervous system problem.
Your body is stuck in survival mode. And here's how you get out.
## Step 1: Understand the exhaustion paradox
Your brain consumes about 20% of your body's energy despite being only 2% of your body
weight. But here's the kicker: decision fatigue and mental conflict drain you faster than actual
work.
Every time you think ""I should work out"" but don't, your brain burns energy processing that
internal battle. Every notification you resist (or don't resist) costs mental resources. [Dr. Roy
Baumeister's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Baumeister) research on ego depletion shows
that making decisions, even tiny ones, depletes your willpower reserves.
So you're tired because you're constantly fighting yourself, not because you're working hard.
That's the loop.
## Step 2: Fix your sleep or nothing else matters
Real talk: you probably suck at sleeping. Most people do. And no, lying in bed scrolling TikTok
for 2 hours doesn't count as ""winding down.""
[Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) by Matthew
Walker (neuroscientist, sleep researcher at UC Berkeley, the book's a bestseller for a reason)
completely changed how I think about rest. Walker's research shows that sleeping less than 7
hours basically makes you drunk the next day, cognitively speaking. Your prefrontal cortex (the
part that handles willpower and decision-making) goes offline first.
The fix is unglamorous: blackout curtains, no screens 1 hour before bed, same sleep schedule
every day (yes, weekends too), and keep your room cold. Your body needs to drop its core
temperature to fall asleep. This isn't sexy advice but it works.
Try the Insight Timer app for sleep meditations. It's free, no BS, just guided sessions that
actually help you switch off. Way better than lying there spiraling about everything you didn't do
today.
## Step 3: Move your body before your mind
Here's something counterintuitive: physical exhaustion actually gives you more energy. Sitting
all day while feeling mentally drained creates this weird limbo where you're too tired to work but
too wired to rest.
Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, his podcast Huberman Lab is insanely good) talks
about how morning sunlight and movement reset your circadian rhythm and dopamine baseline.
Get outside within 1 hour of waking up. Walk for 10 minutes. That's it.
You don't need a gym membership or some intense routine. Just get your heart rate up enough
to break a sweat. Your mitochondria (cellular energy factories) respond to physical stress by
creating MORE energy capacity. It's like training your body's battery to hold a bigger charge.
## Step 4: Kill the zombie scrolling
Let's be honest, you're tired because you're overstimulated. Your nervous system is fried from
constant context switching, notifications, and dopamine hits that go nowhere.
Cal Newport's Deep Work (Georgetown professor, bestselling author who writes about focus in
the digital age) breaks down how our brains aren't designed for this scattered attention lifestyle.
Every time you check your phone, you're triggering a micro stress response. Do that 100 times
a day and you're basically running a marathon while sitting still.
Delete social media apps from your phone. Yeah, all of them. Use a browser with a website
blocker like Cold Turkey if you need to.
If you want to replace scrolling with something that actually helps you grow, check out
[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's an
AI-powered learning app that turns insights from psychology books, research papers, and
expert talks into personalized audio episodes. You can tell it something specific like ""I'm burned
out and want to understand why I'm tired all the time"" and it'll pull from resources on nervous
system regulation, energy management, and behavioral psychology to build a custom learning
plan just for you.
You can adjust how deep you want to go, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep
dive with examples and context. The voice options are surprisingly good too, ranging from calm
and soothing to more energetic styles depending on your mood. It's built by a team from
Columbia and former Google engineers, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. Way
better use of your commute time than doomscrolling.
The first few days without social media feel weird, like phantom limb syndrome for your phone.
But after a week, your brain starts to calm down.
Replace mindless scrolling with Finch, a self care app that gamifies habit building without being
annoying. It's like having a tiny bird friend who checks in on you and celebrates small wins.
Sounds dumb, works great.
## Step 5: Stack your energy, don't spread it thin
You've got maybe 3-4 hours of peak cognitive energy per day. That's it. Stop trying to be ""on"" for
8+ hours. It's not happening.
Time block your hardest task for your peak hours (usually 2-4 hours after waking up for most
people). Do that ONE thing. Then let yourself coast the rest of the day on easier stuff.
Atomic Habits by James Clear (habit formation expert, this book sold like 10 million copies
because it actually works) teaches you to design your environment so the right choice is the
easiest choice. Want to work out? Sleep in your gym clothes. Want to read? Put the book on
your pillow. Want to stop doomscrolling? Charge your phone in another room.
Small environmental tweaks beat willpower every single time.
## Step 6: Address the real issue (probably anxiety)
Here's the uncomfortable truth: most ""tiredness"" is actually anxiety wearing a disguise. You're
exhausted because you're running background processes of worry, self criticism, and future
tripping 24/7.
Your body can't tell the difference between a real threat and an imagined one. So when you're
spiraling about deadlines, money, relationships, or whatever, your sympathetic nervous system
stays activated. That's why you're wired but tired.
The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk (trauma researcher, psychiatrist, this book is
basically the bible for understanding how stress lives in your body) explains how chronic stress
rewires your nervous system. The good news? You can rewire it back.
Try box breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Do this for 2 minutes
when you feel that overwhelming fatigue. It manually switches your nervous system from fight or
flight to rest and digest.
Or check out Ash, a mental health app with actual therapist designed exercises for managing
anxiety and building emotional resilience. Way more practical than generic meditation apps.
## Step 7: Eat like your mitochondria matter
You can't outrun a shit diet. If you're living on coffee, sugar crashes, and takeout, your cells
literally don't have the building blocks to make energy.
Protein and fat stabilize blood sugar. Carbs spike and crash it. Eat protein within 1 hour of
waking up (even if it's just Greek yogurt or eggs). Your brain needs amino acids to make
neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.
Cut the energy drinks and pre workout bullshit. They're borrowing energy from your future self at
predatory interest rates. Drink water. Boring but true.
## Step 8: Give yourself permission to rest (actually)
The irony of being tired from doing nothing is that you never actually rest because you feel too
guilty. You're in this weird purgatory of neither working nor relaxing.
Rest is not earned. It's required. Your body doesn't care if you ""deserve"" it. Schedule real rest
into your day. Not scrolling. Not TV. Actual rest: naps, walks without podcasts, sitting and doing
literally nothing.
This feels impossible at first because we're so conditioned to be ""productive."" But your nervous
system needs downtime to process, repair, and reset. Without it, you stay stuck in the
exhaustion loop.
## The uncomfortable truth
You're tired because you're living in conflict with yourself. Every day you delay, avoid, and
distract, your brain burns energy maintaining that internal war. The way out isn't to push harder.
It's to get honest about what's actually draining you and make small, specific changes that give
your nervous system permission to calm down.
This isn't about becoming some ultra disciplined robot. It's about building a life where you're not
fighting yourself every single day. Where rest feels like rest and work feels like work, instead of
this exhausting blur of neither.
Start with one thing from this list. Not all of them. Just one. Maybe it's fixing your sleep. Maybe
it's deleting Instagram. Maybe it's just going outside tomorrow morning.

	4.	Shree Satyanarayan Sweets – Their chhena ke dahi bade are amazing.

	5.	Vatika Pizzeria – The apple pie with ice cream is really good.

	6.	Ram Bhandar – Great kachori with spicy sabzi, and the old-school vibe at the counter is really interesting.

Things You Can Avoid

1qw68lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1qw68lc/weirdly_aggressive_people_outside_the_beaufort_st/,Weirdly aggressive people outside the Beaufort St dog wash,"Quick heads-up for local dog owners. 

Around 8:25pm last night at the Your Pets Vet outdoor dog wash / fenced dog area, my partner and I had a bizarre and unpleasant run-in with a couple who seemed deeply offended by… dogs existing.

While our dogs were inside the fenced area, an older man started yelling, kicking the fence, threatening to kick the dogs, and even threw a cup of coffee at them. The woman stood there filming us on her phone, for reasons known only to her and Satan. She also filmed our car… they both look like sovereign citizen types. 

The dogs were barking and excited being dogs in a dog area. No one was approached or harmed. Dogs weren’t jumping the fence. Still didn’t stop the full meltdown.

We took photos/videos just in case. I was laughing at them and yelling obscenities. They then walked down Beaufort St toward Woolworths. A few people in cars stopped to check on us and yelled at the couple, which restored a bit of faith in humanity.

No police report since nothing escalated further, but posting in case anyone else has encountered these people or to remind others to stay alert. I did email the vet clinic. 

We love this lil area to wash our dogs in the evening and they love to run around an enclosed space. Living in an apartment nearby with no backyard, this spot has been so fun. Obviously if a dog walks by or they are barking too much we restrain them so they’re not too annoying. If someone was to wash their dog we’d put their leads back on and head out too. This vet is amazing so it makes me really sad to have experienced this moment. 

Don’t know if I should attach photos or not depending on the rules but I can happily share. ",13,1770251559.0,perth,9,0.93,False

This is a personal essay based on real events. It’s a first draft written as a release.

I’d appreciate thoughts on how it lands as a reader, rather than detailed edits.

————-

Title: Losing You, Lost Me

It’s been over a month now…

and while nothing has changed, everything changed.

I’m not the same person I was and I still don’t know if that’s for the better or for the worse — all I know for certain is that I’ve changed for good.

How cruel does life seem sometimes… I sat next to you when you took your last breath.

I try to push the image as far back as I possibly can so I don’t break.

When we landed on Monday, we went straight to the hospital. You were in the ICU still.

You were fine Saturday morning. Not great, but you could still speak a little. There was hope.

It was around midnight when I got the call from my brother. He was crying.

He never cried when he called with updates, no matter how bad — he always kept his composure.

He explains that you had began bleeding internally. They had done blood transfusions. There was a procedure they could do to stop the bleeding, but it came with great risks, seeing as you were in such a delicate state.

We agreed to go forward with the procedure.

Until I got another call at 2am. He’s crying again.

He explained how much you were suffering. That the procedure may or may not work. You’d still have the cirrhosis to deal with after, the pneumonia you had, the pulmonary issue which required you to use an oxygen tube, and the liver cancer.

We were being selfish. Putting you through so much when it was clear your body couldn’t give… it just couldn’t give.

That night — you were placed in comfort care.

You’d be given morphine so you wouldn’t be in pain and — it would only be a matter of time.

We had said our goodbyes via FaceTime, but we all flew to you anyway.

I knew what to expect when I walked into your room. Had an idea at least.

But nothing could have prepared me for what it would have been like to actually see you like that.

I broke down before I even stepped foot in your room — I saw you through the glass window.

You weren’t you anymore.

You couldn’t move.

You couldn’t talk.

You couldn’t even move your eyes.

I didn’t get to say bye to you how I wanted.

I didn’t get to tell you I love you how I wanted.

I didn’t get to apologize to you how I wanted.

But I was there and I didn’t leave your side.

We made calls — we called family and close friends so they could say their final goodbye to you.

People cried. Everyone did. You’re so loved.

I wish you could have seen how packed your hospital room was.

People would trickle in and out. There were so many of us. We talked to you. We told stories about you. We would laugh and spend time together, the way you always loved.

Because if there was one thing you loved, it was a united family.

After two days, the social worker managed to get you to a hospice facility. A larger room where we could all fit comfortably, especially you.

And we did.

We were there two days.

Every moment, every minute, every second — we were on edge. Waiting. Waiting because we all knew what would happen but also hoping.

They say that hope is the last thing that you lose, and up until the final second — I hoped. A miracle. God please.

That last day… we woke up, we ordered our usual coffee, and we decided to make a playlist of all of your favorite songs and we played them for you — all day.

By noon, everyone had already arrived.

At 2:30pm — everyone was in the room with us, but I was the only one at your side at this point, playing a game on my phone. Still — being mindful of your breathing. Every 4–6 seconds.

They were having a light conversation, I can’t even tell you about what because I wasn’t listening… when suddenly, you didn’t breathe.

I can still feel the panic and shock my body experienced. I looked at you — and nothing.

My uncle was saying something to the group, smiling, when I just… exclaimed,

“Sorry, sorry — he’s not breathing. He stopped breathing!”

They all stopped and looked at you. And of course, you took a deep breath then.

“You scared me, mona,” my uncle told me.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry everyone. I’m sorry.”

But I knew then. I knew what was happening.

My leg started shaking harder than I’ve ever felt it shake before and as much as I wanted to stop, I couldn’t. Suddenly, I felt tears streaming down my face. I couldn’t control that either.

My sister noticed and came to sit next to me. Hand on my knee.

Linda and I were both looking at you when we noticed your lips doing something different when you were breathing. It seemed as though you were pursing them — that was new.

So I called my brother over —

“Ed, look. Come look at his lips. He wasn’t doing that before.”

And he comes to stand over you, opposite of me, on the other side of the bed.

I started timing your breathing and my crying only got worse.

It’s the three of us.

And we fall silent. Everyone falls silent.

18 seconds, 26 seconds, 20 seconds, 13 seconds, 26 seconds, 20…

Ed started crying. Linda was crying.

Suddenly, everyone joined us, quietly.

12 seconds, 25 seconds, 26 seconds, 25 seconds…

And then I didn’t press stop on the stopwatch until 9 minutes and 17 seconds.

2:57pm. You left us. I’ll never forget your last breath.

“Mary Es Mi Amor” playing in the background.

I’ll never forget the heartache I felt.

Once I realized there wasn’t going to be another breath, my tears came pouring out.

My aunt was praying over you. I can’t even tell you what she said. I blacked out.

Someone started hugging me from behind, holding Linda and I together. Pulling us close, and I wanted them to let fucking go of me.

Let go of me.

I held your hand.

And I got up. I left the room. I was the first to leave because I couldn’t break down in front of everyone.

I walked out to the patio. Looked at the sky and just released.

I cried hard. Loud. You weren’t meant to have left us.

You didn’t deserve this. You didn’t deserve to leave the way you did.

There was so much we were supposed to do. We had to take you to Spain. You were meant to meet my kid. You were supposed to help me buy my first house.

We were supposed to reconnect.

You were supposed to be fucking happy.

I forgave you. I hope you forgive me too.

Losing you changed me.

I’m not sure how to be happy, at least not for now.

I know one day I will be.

But in the meantime — everything is heavy.

I’ll keep missing you, wishing you were here.

I always will.

I love you, dad.

1qw67m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1qw67m5/i_found_some_information_related_to_nepal_in_the/,I found some information related to Nepal in the Epstein files.,"I specifically tried to find any diplomatic communication between Israel and Nepal, or even rumors or gossip about it, but couldn’t find anything relevant. But below are some stuffs i found;

They mentioned a few Nepal-related importing things like beds, silk rugs, coffee tables, and silk undergarments supposedly made in Nepal. There was also a line that said, “I’m wearing a white T-shirt and you can see my Nepalese a bit.”

I also came across references to a few resumes from Nepali housekeepers in New York, along with donations for earthquake relief. JE mentioned donating to Nepali medical student associations, saying, “I spend 10K per year supporting medical student associations in Nepal.”

One message, though, felt a bit questionable. It talked about getting fecal samples from Nepalese children, suggesting interest in bringing samples because Nepalese kids “don’t get sick.” The message said something like, “Bugs me no one was doing it, pretty cool, especially if I can get fecal samples from healthy babies and grown-ups in places like Tibet or Nepal…”

There was also a message that read, “Just finished big motorcycle run with Siva’s Slaves in Kathmandu.” This wasn’t written by Jeffrey but by his associate, billionaire Tom Pritzker, so it’s hard to tell what “Siva’s Slaves” actually refers to. Jeffrey later replied, “Interesting opportunity.” Just to let you they used to refer their hostages as slaves. ",5,1770251486.0,NepalSocial,6,0.86,False

Repped actor/filmmaker in Astoria here looking to connect with a few talented writer/directors & DP's to collaborate on creating a few high-quality, no-budget short films. I made a post recently and have since met a bunch of awesome people.

I’m a classically trained actor with good rep. & a few credits on major tv shows, hundreds of auditions for SAG tv/film, for very cool stuff like The Chair Company, The Agency, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood sequel, etc. Last week, I had auditions for a series regular on Joel Kinnamin's next Amazon show, a recurring guest for the Bosch prequel, and a large multi scene costar for Power Origins, just for context of where I’m at professionally and what I bring to the table. 

My 1st short I wrote/directed was a police corruption conspiracy. My next two are a psychological thriller & a horror fable. Biggest influences are Fincher, anything HBO, Veep, Sopranos, Fargo, Leftovers, Mad Men, Succession, Mr InBetween, Arrested Development, Barry, The Terror, There Will Be Blood, Charlie Kaufman, Danny McBride, Adult Swim, Key & Peel, Kids in The Hall, The Peter Serafinowicz Show, etc. you get the idea. 

My goal is to build a portfolio to use to solicit financing for a slate of features & series down the road + expand my network of filmmaker friends.

If you’re interested, shoot me a DM with a link to your reel / website + availability over the next 2 weeks & we can set up a time to grab coffee or Zoom & talk shop.

1qw653n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1qw653n/how_to_become_the_best_husband_sciencebased/,How to Become the Best Husband: Science-Based Lessons from Psychology and Guys Who Figured It Out,"ok so i studied relationship psychology for months because I kept seeing the same pattern. good dudes, genuinely trying, still failing at marriage. not cheating or being abusive, just...slowly becoming roommates who occasionally argue about whose turn it is to take out the trash.

turns out being a good husband isn't about grand gestures or ""happy wife happy life"" bumper sticker wisdom. it's about understanding some counterintuitive shit that most guys never learn. I went deep into research, podcasts, books from actual relationship experts, and it changed how I see everything.

here's what actually works:

**stop trying to fix her problems**

women don't vent to get solutions. they vent to feel heard. your instinct is to jump in with advice because that's how you show love, you want to help. but she's not asking you to troubleshoot her day like it's a broken appliance.

when she complains about work drama, she doesn't need you to explain office politics. she needs you to say ""that sounds exhausting"" and actually mean it. just listen. nod. ask questions. resist every urge to problem solve unless she explicitly asks ""what should I do?""

this one shift alone has saved countless marriages according to Dr. John Gottman's research at the Love Lab. his book [*The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553447718) is legitimately the best marriage manual ever written. Gottman studied thousands of couples and can predict divorce with 90% accuracy just by watching them argue for a few minutes. the dude has awards and decades of data. his big finding is that successful marriages aren't about compatibility or never fighting, they're about how you handle conflict and daily interactions. this book will make you question everything you think you know about relationships. it's dense but insanely practical.

**do the boring shit without being asked**

nothing kills attraction faster than becoming another child she has to manage. if you wait to be told to do dishes, take out trash, schedule dentist appointments, you're not helping, you're adding to her mental load.

she shouldn't have to be the household project manager. learn what needs doing and just do it. notice when toilet paper is low. see the laundry basket filling up. realize the kid needs new shoes before she mentions it.

this isn't about chores, it's about being an actual partner who shares the invisible labor of running a life together. [*Fair Play*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525541934) by Eve Rodsky breaks down this concept brilliantly. she's a Harvard trained lawyer and organizational management specialist who created a whole system for couples to rebalance domestic work. the book won a bunch of awards and became this massive movement because it articulated something women have been screaming about forever. highly recommend if you want to understand why she's frustrated even though you ""help out.""

**make bids for connection**

Gottman calls them ""bids."" she points out a bird outside the window. she shows you a meme. she mentions wanting to try a new restaurant. these are bids for your attention.

you can turn toward the bid (engage with genuine interest), turn away (ignore it), or turn against it (be dismissive). couples who stay together turn toward bids 86% of the time. couples who divorce turn toward only 33% of the time.

seems minor right? but it's not about the bird or the meme, it's about her reaching out and you reaching back. do this consistently and you build a massive reservoir of goodwill. ignore these moments and you're basically telling her she doesn't matter.

**fight better, not less**

every couple fights. the difference is whether you fight dirty or fair. criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling are the four horsemen of relationship apocalypse according to Gottman.

when arguing, complain about the specific behavior without attacking her character. ""I felt hurt when you cancelled our plans"" not ""you never prioritize us."" take responsibility for your part. don't shut down or walk away without saying you need a break. repair attempts matter more than avoiding conflict.

the app Paired is actually pretty solid for this. it's like duolingo for relationships, gives you daily questions and exercises to improve communication. you both download it and it prompts conversations you'd never have otherwise. weirdly effective.

if you want something more structured and personalized for building communication skills, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) is worth checking out. it's a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google experts that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create audio learning plans tailored to your specific goals, like ""become a better communicator in marriage"" or ""master emotional intelligence as a husband."" you customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and pick voices that actually keep you engaged. it also has this virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with about your unique struggles, and it'll recommend content that fits exactly what you're dealing with. makes the whole learning process way more digestible when you're commuting or at the gym.

**maintain your own identity**

counterintuitive but crucial. the best husbands don't make their wife their entire world. keep your hobbies. maintain friendships. have goals outside the marriage.

when you abandon everything that made you interesting, you become boring. she didn't marry you to absorb you, she married you because you were a whole person. stay a whole person.

also, having your own life means you're not constantly hovering and needing her validation. neediness kills attraction faster than almost anything.

**show up during the boring 99%**

marriage isn't about valentines day or anniversaries. it's about the random tuesday when she's tired and you make dinner without mentioning it. it's remembering she likes her coffee a specific way. it's texting her something funny mid afternoon just because.

these micro moments compound. the podcast *Where Should We Begin* by Esther Perel is fucking phenomenal for understanding this. Perel is probably the most respected couples therapist alive, she's been featured everywhere and her insights are razor sharp. she records actual therapy sessions (anonymized obviously) and you hear real couples working through real shit. you realize every marriage has struggles and it's not about being perfect, it's about staying curious about each other.

**physical affection without agenda**

touch her without it leading to sex. hold her hand. hug her for no reason. kiss her goodbye like you mean it.

when every touch becomes transactional, like you're just collecting affection tokens to cash in for sex later, she feels used not loved. non sexual physical intimacy builds safety and connection.

**apologize like an adult**

""I'm sorry you feel that way"" is not an apology. ""I'm sorry but you also..."" is not an apology.

real apologies name what you did wrong, acknowledge the impact, and commit to doing better. no justifications. no deflecting. just own your shit.

this is hard because it requires vulnerability and admitting you messed up. but it's also the fastest way to repair and move forward.

**keep dating her**

after marriage, after kids, after life gets chaotic, you still need to prioritize couple time. plan actual dates. learn new things together. be curious about who she's becoming.

people change. the woman you married isn't the same person in 5 or 10 years. neither are you. successful marriages treat this as an adventure not a betrayal.

look, being a great husband isn't complicated but it requires consistent effort. you can't coast on autopilot. the skills are learnable though. nobody's born knowing this stuff. and honestly if you're reading this far you probably already care enough to figure it out.",2,1770251312.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

1qw643t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw643t,K7 vs ZP6 particle distribution – I ran the numbers (ChatGPT-assisted analysis),"  
I have been considering upgrading my Kingrinder K6 and was doing research ont he K-Ultra vs Zp6. Then I stubled on the K7 which I didn't know about. After some digging, I stumbled on the [only post/review that has qualitative data](https://forum-clubedocafe-net.translate.goog/topic/16290-kingrinder-k7/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=vi&_x_tr_pto=wapp). I could barely read the blury picture, so I asked ChatGPT to decode it and make sense of the numbers. Below is ChatGPT's output and thought I would share.  
  
I'm going to get the K7 based on the results below, the lower price, and the magnetic catch cup that the ZP6 does not have.  
  
To be clear, the above is written by a tired human. The below was written by AI. I've attached a table of it's output, and the original PSD readings found in the linked blog post.

Hope this helps someone. Cheers to many great coffee cups

\-----

TLDR: 

>

  
Hey all,  
I wanted to share an analysis of a **particle size distribution (PSD) image comparing the Kingrinder K7 and 1Zpresso ZP6**, because there’s a lot of speculation around these grinders and not much quantitative discussion.

To

**Important upfront:**  
👉 This post was **written by ChatGPT**, based on a PSD image that’s been circulating (laser particle analyzer output).  
👉 I’m sharing it because the math and interpretation are solid, not as marketing or hype.

# What the image shows (approximate values)

Both grinders were tested at matched grind sizes (means are nearly identical), which makes this a valid comparison.

# ZP6 (54 clicks)

* D10: \~192 µm
* D50: \~849 µm
* D90: \~1237 µm
* Mean: \~989 µm
* SD (standard deviation): \~391.8

# K7 (88 clicks)

* D10: \~174 µm
* D50: \~865 µm
* D90: \~1193 µm
* Mean: \~991 µm
* SD: \~359.9

# Percent difference (K7 vs ZP6)

Using ZP6 as the baseline:

* **Mean particle size:** \+0.2% → Effectively identical grind size
* **D50 (median):** \+1.9% → Negligible difference
* **D10 (fines):** −9.4% → K7 shows slightly smaller D10 (more fines in this test)
* **D90 (boulders):** −3.6% → K7 has fewer large particles
* **Standard deviation:** **−8.1%** → K7 is \~8% tighter in spread *in this measurement*

# What this actually means

* The grinders are **extremely close** in particle distribution
* Differences appear to be **single-digit percentages**
* In this specific test:
   * K7 has a slightly tighter distribution
   * ZP6 has slightly fewer fines
* These are **same-league differences**, not “night and day”

A reasonable takeaway from the data alone is:

>

# What this does not prove

* This does **not** prove K7 is universally better
* This does **not** replace ZP6’s broader track record
* This is one dataset:
   * One grinder
   * One bean
   * One grind range
   * One test

ZP6 still has:

* More independent testing
* More long-term user data
* More consistency across multiple reviews

K7 just looks **far closer than commonly assumed**, based on actual numbers.

# Why I think this matters

A lot of discussion around these grinders is vibe-based (“filter burrs”, “clarity grinder”, etc.). This image shows that:

* K7 is not a “budget compromise” in PSD terms
* The gap between K7 and ZP6 may be **overstated**, at least for some use cases

Cup quality still depends on:

* Brew method
* Recipe
* Preference (clarity vs texture)
* Consistency across beans

But from a **distribution standpoint**, this data deserves to be part of the conversation.

Happy to hear counterpoints, especially if anyone has:

* Additional PSD plots
* Multi-bean comparisons
* Cup-based blind tests

Again, full transparency: **this write-up was generated with ChatGPT**, using the PSD image and straightforward math.",0,1770251243.0,pourover,0,0.33,False
1qw639d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_pacsun1980/comments/1qw639d/11_under25_stocking_stuffer_gifts_hell_love/,11 Under-$25 Stocking Stuffer Gifts He’ll Love,"Finding a fire gift and staying under $25 is a skill. This is your cheat sheet.

All of these picks are pulled straight from Pacsun’s Men’s Gifts Under $25 gift guide, so you’re not guessing — you’re shopping the actual curated list.

Think: comfy sweats, graphic tees, grooming upgrades, even vinyl… all guy-approved, all budget-friendly.

# 1. The Cozy King: Light Gray Straight Leg Sweatpants

If his personality is “hoodie and sweats,” this is the move. The Light Gray Straight Leg Sweatpants give him that laid-back, clean look without the bulky jogger cuffs.

**Why he’ll vibe with it:**

Neutral gray goes with literally everything he already owns

Straight leg = looks more “intentional fit” than “rolled out of bed”

Priced right around $25 (and often on promo), so it looks spendy without killing your wallet

**Best for:** boyfriends, brothers, or that friend who shows up everywhere in sweatpants.

# 2. The Everyday Graphic: Off White Pacific Sunwear Collegiate T-Shirt

This off-white collegiate graphic tee is the kind of top he’ll actually wear on repeat — over jeans, with cargos, under a flannel… it’s giving “campus core.”

**Why it hits:**

Clean varsity-inspired graphic that’s trendy but not screaming for attention

Under-$20 price point (at time of writing), so it’s a no-stress add-to-cart

Easy sizing and super giftable for literally any guy in your life

**Pro tip:** Size up if he likes that oversized streetwear fit.

# 3. The “Smells Expensive” Pick: Hidden Hills Cologne

For the guy who’s still using the same body spray from high school… upgrade him. The Hidden Hills Cologne is a sleek, under-$25 fragrance that looks and feels way more luxe than its price tag.

**Why this is low-key elite:**

Compact bottle = perfect for gym bag, backpack, or carry-on

Scent profile that works for everyday — not too heavy, not too sweet

Comes from the men’s accessories section, so it’s built to complement his fits

Perfect for: bfs, situationships, or honestly… a “to: me, from: me” moment.

# 4. For the F1 Obsessive: Formula 1 x Pacsun US Grand Prix 2025 Austin Texas Beanie

If he’s streaming every race and arguing about tire strategy, this one’s a no-brainer. The Formula 1 x Pacsun United States Grand Prix 2025 Austin Texas Beanie is a collab piece that feels collectible and wearable.

**Why it’s a podium-level gift:**

Official F1 collab energy under $25

Cozy beanie he’ll rock all winter, not just on race day

Great conversation starter for fellow F1 nerds

This is hero-status stocking stuffer material.

# 5. The “His Laundry Is Never Done” Hack: 3 Pack Neutral Brown Crew Socks

You cannot go wrong with socks, especially when they actually look good. The 3 Pack Neutral Brown Crew Socks are staples that match pretty much any sneaker rotation.

**Why these are sneaky-elite:**

Neutral browns = earth-tone trend, but subtle

Three pairs in one under-$25 gift, so it feels generous

Perfect backup gift when you “weren’t gonna get each other anything” but show up with vibes anyway

Slide these in as a bonus gift or build a mini care package around them.

# 6. Streetwear Legend Mode: RODMAN BRAND Star Globe T-Shirt

For the guy who loves vintage sports and bold graphics, the RODMAN BRAND Star Globe T-Shirt is such a moment. It’s giving retro, statement, and a bit of chaos — just like Rodman.

**Why it slaps:**

Graphic that looks like something he thrifted, but without the hunt

Under-$25 while still feeling like a limited-drop tee

Works with jeans, cargos, even layered under an open flannel

This is a solid pick for fashion-guy friends who don’t want basic basics.

# 7. Soft Grunge Energy: Grey & Red Plaid Long Sleeve Flannel Shirt

The grey & red plaid long sleeve flannel hits that sweet spot between cozy and “I tried a little.” Tossed over a tee, it’s instant outfit.

**Why he’ll wear it non-stop:**

Plaid pattern that works for fall, winter, and chilly spring days

Easy to dress up or down — date night or coffee run

Hovers around that $25 mark (often on sale), so it’s big-gift energy, small price

Pair it with the collegiate tee from #2 for an under-$50 combo gift.

# 8. For the Fight Fan: Mike Tyson Money Man T-Shirt

Know a guy who’s always quoting old boxing clips or loves combat sports? The Mike Tyson Money Man T-Shirt brings vintage fight-poster energy to his wardrobe.

**Why it’s a knockout gift:**

Iconic boxer graphic = instantly recognizable

Fun statement piece he’ll throw on for game night, watch parties, or the gym

Discounted under $25, so you’re basically winning by TKO

This one feels super personal if he’s a Tyson fan — easy W.

# 9. For the Music Purist: Alice in Chains Jar of Flies Vinyl

If he’s into alt, rock, or just collects records “for the aesthetic,” the Alice in Chains Jar of Flies Vinyl Record is such a cool under-$25 flex.

**Why this is main-character gift behavior:**

Actual vinyl = feels way more thoughtful than a playlist link

Looks sick on a shelf even if he doesn’t own a record player yet

Classic album that earns you instant taste points

Great for music-guy friends, older brothers, or that artsy coworker.

# 10. Loungewear 2.0: Dark Gray Straight Leg Sweatpants

Yes, we’re putting another pair of sweats on this list because he’ll absolutely rotate them. The Dark Gray Straight Leg Sweatpants give him a slightly darker option that still goes with everything.

**Why doubling up makes sense:**

Darker shade = better for travel, errands, and “oops I spilled coffee” days

Same laid-back straight-leg vibe as the light pair

Under $25 with promo pricing, so you can gift a “set” without breaking budget

Match it with a hoodie he already owns, and his winter uniform is basically locked in.

# 11. Grooming Upgrade: Blind Barber Beard Replenishment Oil

If he has a beard (or is trying to grow one), this is a glow-up in a bottle. The Blind Barber Beard Replenishment Oil feels high-end but still sits in the under-$25 zone.

**Why this is such a smart gift:**

Makes his beard softer and less itchy = he thinks of you every time he uses it

Sleek packaging that looks good on his bathroom counter

From a known grooming brand carried in Pacsun’s men’s accessories section

This is clutch for bfs, dads, or any dude in his “self-care era.”

# How To Pick The Right Under-$25 Gift (In 30 Seconds)

If you’re hovering over “add to bag” and overthinking it, here’s a quick decision guide using this same Pacsun under-$25 men’s gift page:

**For cozy/homebody guys:** go sweats + socks (#1, #5, #10)

**For fashion/streetwear guys:** grab a graphic tee or flannel (#2, #6, #7, #8)

**For hobby guys:** choose vinyl or fandom pieces (#4, #8, #9)

**For glow-up guys:** lean into fragrance or grooming (#3, #11)

All of it stays under $25 each, so you can mix and match without your cart total jump-scaring you at checkout.",1,1770251179.0,u_pacsun1980,0,1.0,False

Title: Losing You, Lost Me

It’s been over a month now…

and while nothing has changed, everything changed.

I’m not the same person I was and I still don’t know if that’s for the better or for the worse — all I know for certain is that I’ve changed for good.

How cruel does life seem sometimes… I sat next to you when you took your last breath.

I try to push the image as far back as I possibly can so I don’t break.

When we landed on Monday, we went straight to the hospital. You were in the ICU still.

You were fine Saturday morning. Not great, but you could still speak a little. There was hope.

It was around midnight when I got the call from my brother. He was crying.

He never cried when he called with updates, no matter how bad — he always kept his composure.

He explains that you had began bleeding internally. They had done blood transfusions. There was a procedure they could do to stop the bleeding, but it came with great risks, seeing as you were in such a delicate state.

We agreed to go forward with the procedure.

Until I got another call at 2am. He’s crying again.

He explained how much you were suffering. That the procedure may or may not work. You’d still have the cirrhosis to deal with after, the pneumonia you had, the pulmonary issue which required you to use an oxygen tube, and the liver cancer.

We were being selfish. Putting you through so much when it was clear your body couldn’t give… it just couldn’t give.

That night — you were placed in comfort care.

You’d be given morphine so you wouldn’t be in pain and — it would only be a matter of time.

We had said our goodbyes via FaceTime, but we all flew to you anyway.

I knew what to expect when I walked into your room. Had an idea at least.

But nothing could have prepared me for what it would have been like to actually see you like that.

I broke down before I even stepped foot in your room — I saw you through the glass window.

You weren’t you anymore.

You couldn’t move.

You couldn’t talk.

You couldn’t even move your eyes.

I didn’t get to say bye to you how I wanted.

I didn’t get to tell you I love you how I wanted.

I didn’t get to apologize to you how I wanted.

But I was there and I didn’t leave your side.

We made calls — we called family and close friends so they could say their final goodbye to you.

People cried. Everyone did. You’re so loved.

I wish you could have seen how packed your hospital room was.

People would trickle in and out. There were so many of us. We talked to you. We told stories about you. We would laugh and spend time together, the way you always loved.

Because if there was one thing you loved, it was a united family.

After two days, the social worker managed to get you to a hospice facility. A larger room where we could all fit comfortably, especially you.

And we did.

We were there two days.

Every moment, every minute, every second — we were on edge. Waiting. Waiting because we all knew what would happen but also hoping.

They say that hope is the last thing that you lose, and up until the final second — I hoped. A miracle. God please.

That last day… we woke up, we ordered our usual coffee, and we decided to make a playlist of all of your favorite songs and we played them for you — all day.

By noon, everyone had already arrived.

At 2:30pm — everyone was in the room with us, but I was the only one at your side at this point, playing a game on my phone. Still — being mindful of your breathing. Every 4–6 seconds.

They were having a light conversation, I can’t even tell you about what because I wasn’t listening… when suddenly, you didn’t breathe.

I can still feel the panic and shock my body experienced. I looked at you — and nothing.

My uncle was saying something to the group, smiling, when I just… exclaimed,

“Sorry, sorry — he’s not breathing. He stopped breathing!”

They all stopped and looked at you. And of course, you took a deep breath then.

“You scared me, mona,” my uncle told me.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry everyone. I’m sorry.”

But I knew then. I knew what was happening.

My leg started shaking harder than I’ve ever felt it shake before and as much as I wanted to stop, I couldn’t. Suddenly, I felt tears streaming down my face. I couldn’t control that either.

My sister noticed and came to sit next to me. Hand on my knee.

Linda and I were both looking at you when we noticed your lips doing something different when you were breathing. It seemed as though you were pursing them — that was new.

So I called my brother over —

“Ed, look. Come look at his lips. He wasn’t doing that before.”

And he comes to stand over you, opposite of me, on the other side of the bed.

I started timing your breathing and my crying only got worse.

It’s the three of us.

And we fall silent. Everyone falls silent.

18 seconds, 26 seconds, 20 seconds, 13 seconds, 26 seconds, 20…

Ed started crying. Linda was crying.

Suddenly, everyone joined us, quietly.

12 seconds, 25 seconds, 26 seconds, 25 seconds…

And then I didn’t press stop on the stopwatch until 9 minutes and 17 seconds.

2:57pm. You left us. I’ll never forget your last breath.

“Mary Es Mi Amor” playing in the background.

I’ll never forget the heartache I felt.

Once I realized there wasn’t going to be another breath, my tears came pouring out.

My aunt was praying over you. I can’t even tell you what she said. I blacked out.

Someone started hugging me from behind, holding Linda and I together. Pulling us close, and I wanted them to let fucking go of me.

Let go of me.

I held your hand.

And I got up. I left the room. I was the first to leave because I couldn’t break down in front of everyone.

I walked out to the patio. Looked at the sky and just released.

I cried hard. Loud. You weren’t meant to have left us.

You didn’t deserve this. You didn’t deserve to leave the way you did.

There was so much we were supposed to do. We had to take you to Spain. You were meant to meet my kid. You were supposed to help me buy my first house.

We were supposed to reconnect.

You were supposed to be fucking happy.

I forgave you. I hope you forgive me too.

Losing you changed me.

I’m not sure how to be happy, at least not for now.

I know one day I will be.

But in the meantime — everything is heavy.

I’ll keep missing you, wishing you were here.

I always will.

I love you, dad.

For context, I’m a Financial Management graduate currently working as an Accounting Specialist earning 55k. I just received two job offers, and I’m honestly torn.

Offer 1 – Australian client

	•	Customer service role

	•	Onsite, morning shift

	•	Salary: 32k

	•	Free lunch and coffee

Offer 2 – US client

	•	Work from home

	•	Night shift

	•	Salary: 60k

My main concern with the US client is the night shift. I’ve read a lot about how it can negatively affect mental and physical health. I also previously worked with a US client who ended my contract after just 2 months, so I still have some fear about job security.

On the other hand, I’ve seen people say that Australian clients are generally more understanding and less stressful, but the pay cut from 55k to 32k is pretty big, and it’s also an onsite role.

I’m stuck between higher pay + WFH versus better work-life balance + potentially healthier environment.

For those who’ve worked with US or Australian clients, or have experience with night shifts—what would you choose in my situation?

Thanks in advance.",1,1770250737.0,buhaydigital,2,0.67,False
1qw5w1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qw5w1q/flypaper/,Flypaper,"It wasn’t every day. They tried to be clever about it; you know, mixing things up a bit. They’d do it one day, but then not the next two. Maybe every other day for a week, then they’d skip a few days in a row, but never a whole week. They couldn’t go a whole week. I don’t think they could wait that long. Couldn’t resist the urge, the grubby little bastards. Anyway, it was those delays, the spaced-out randomness. That’s why it took me a minute to figure out who it was.

At first I thought it was Billy. He was always an ass to me. Mouthing off, showing off, trying to put me down or embarrass me in front of the rest of them. Actually, I kinda wish it was him. I’d love to lay all the blame on him, but it wasn’t him.

Then there’s that crabby old bastard, Henry. What a peach he is, always ragging on everybody as if they’re not doing enough to pull their own weight.

Of course, Sue believes everything Henry says. He’s her little tattletale. And she makes out the schedule according to whatever little gossip those two shit-heels are talking about.

Honestly, it shouldn’t have surprised me that it was Samantha… “Sam and Tam.” Samantha and her sycophantic little tagalong, Tammy. “Oh, look at Sam and Tam. They’re so cute. They wore matching blouses today. They smell so good. Their hair is so pretty.”

Makes me wanna puke. Sam and Tam were those manipulative, bouncy, bubblegum-chewing, cutesy girls that always got their way. Mostly, because everyone was always intimidated by them or wanted to be close to them. If you were in their way, they’d knock you down and make it look like an accident. While no one else was looking, they’d smirk at you with one of those snide little “Ha, ha smiles”— just to let you know that they were reveling in it.

I called them the wonder twins. As in, “I wonder if they’re going to do any work today?” They were so spoiled.

If Sue saw me notice Sam and Tam slacking off, she wouldn’t get after them. Oh no… she’d scold me. “Robert, if you have time to criticize Sam and Tam, then you’re not doing your job. Now, get back to work ya slacker!”

Anyway, I was tired of whoever it was helping themselves to whatever they wanted from my lunch in the locker room. It was my turn. This time I would get the last laugh.

So the trick was, I needed something that would last, something that could sit in there for a few days without going bad. I also wanted to see it happen. So I had those two obstacles to overcome in order to achieve my ultimate goal.

The first one was easy. I’d go with the tried and true, the dependable, a good old tray of brownies. No need to be super creative with the bait. It’s not like I was trying to reinvent the wheel or anything.

The second obstacle was a little bit harder. How do I watch? When pulling off something this elaborate, you gotta be able to see what happens. And I was definitely going to be able to see the results.

The question was, how? Do I try to time things just right, hide in an unused locker or up in the drop ceiling, and peek through the vent holes? Do I drill out a peephole through the wall that lines up with my locker from the storage room on the other side? Do I burst into the room and catch them in the act on camera? And there it was — a camera. I needed a camera. Except I wasn’t going to burst into the room. I didn’t need to.

I found one of those $20 body cams and put a 64 gig card in it. That sucker recorded for five hours straight. You couldn’t hardly even see it peeking out over the top of my locker.

It was a beautiful thing, you know — the moment of truth — when it happened. That cheap little camera takes an amazing picture. Honestly, I’m kinda shocked at how good it looks for the price. The fact is, it’s a miracle that I got it back and was able to watch it at all.

So I made an event out of it. I picked up my best pal, Karl Burton. We went to our local movie theater and picked up a couple of large popcorns, loaded them up with butter, and went back to my place to watch the video.

My 80-inch TV made it look like we were there, right in the room with them. I fast-forwarded through the first couple of hours. People raced in and out of the break room like bees buzzing a ripe flower. And then… there she was… Samantha. I should’ve known it was her.

She looked like someone sneaking around playing hide-and-seek or maybe stealing the milk money at school, looking over her shoulders, peeking around corners, etc. And then… she did it. She took the bait.

Almost immediately, Tammy came walking in behind her.

Sam was standing there, holding my tray of brownies.

They were just laughing it up when Billy walked in.

That smart-ass almost ruined the whole thing. He starts scolding them, saying he’s going to rat them out to Sue. They hadn’t even taken a single bite yet.

Then, Henry — gotta give Henry some credit here. Henry shows up and saves the day. He walks into the room, sees what they’re bickering about, sets his cigarette down on the edge of an ashtray, grabs a brownie, and shoves the whole thing into his mouth.

Sue comes strolling in right behind Henry. She laughs, grabs a handful, says, “What Robert doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” and shoves it into her mouth. She smears it around with her palm, stuffing it all up in there.

They’re all laughing and digging in. Gorging up my brownies.

Karl is looking at me. “So, what’s the gag? Laxatives? Ipecac? What? What is it? Robert, what did you do?”

“Just keep watching, Karl. You’ll see.”

Sam’s face crunches up. Her eyes bulge. She reaches up, sticks a couple fingers into her mouth, and pulls out a long strand of something stringy.

Around the room, the faces of the others look spooked, like they’ve just stumbled onto a dead body, a ghost, or something. They’ve stopped chewing, and their faces are drooping.

Billy pulls a long strand out from between his lips and mumbles with a mouthful, “What da hell is dis?”

Henry’s eyes bulge even bigger than his stuffed mouth. “Dats fwy papa.”

Tammy reaches into the bottom of the tray, digs under the remaining crumbs, and pulls out a Polaroid. She chokes and sputters, holding it up for all to see.

Karl is looking at me. “Robert, what’s in the picture?”

I just hold up a finger. “Ssshhh. Just keep watching.”

Sue turns her head and throws up all over the side of Sam’s face.

Sam throws up on Tammy.

Billy throws up on Henry.

Henry punches Billy.

Tammy starts stumbling around, choking and flailing. They’re all panicking.

I pull another Polaroid from my pocket and toss it on the coffee table in front of Karl.

“What am I looking at here, Robert? What is that?”

“Flypaper. The sticky stuff. I hung it up out in the pig barn. And it’s covered, riddled with all sorts of bugs.”

His face is pale green and sweaty. “You put… that… in the brownies?”

“Yeah… Once I had enough. Once they were covered with all those creepy crawly things. I blended ’em up and mixed ‘em in.”

“Bug Brownies?”

“Yeppers… Bug Brownies.”

“Aw… You can shut it off now. I’m good. I don’t need to see any more. I… I don’t wanna throw up.”

“Just give it another second.”

Looking back at the TV, we watch Tammy flop back-first onto the table, choking and grabbing at her throat.

Karl leans closer to me and whispers, “What’s happening to her? Why is she choking like that?”

“Look, it was an accident. How was I supposed to know that she was allergic to peanut butter?”

“You put peanut butter in the brownies?”

“No… No, I didn’t. That’s the thing. See, I knew that could be risky. So I intentionally did not put peanut butter in there. Ya never know who’s allergic. Actually, I’m pretty proud of myself for being so considerate in that way. You know, thinking of others and all?”

Karl is just staring at me.

I continue. “Interestingly, it was the bugs: crickets, locusts, fruit flies, mealworms, etc. Tropomyosin.”

“Tropo… what-osin?”

“Tropomyosin… It’s this protein that can be found in some bugs. It can have the same effects as peanut butter or shellfish on people with allergies.”

We look back at the TV.

Sammy and Sue are trying to help Tammy.

Henry’s ashtray slips off the table. His cigarette lands on the floor. It rolls across the linoleum and settles against a loose rag.

Billy and Henry stumble around, fighting, kicking, and punching each other. They stumble into the lockers near the door, which proceed to fall, spilling old uniforms on top of the burning rag.

One locker gets jammed, wedged, and pinched in between the lockers at its top and bottom, completely blocking the doorway, their only exit. 

Billy falls on top of it, further pinning it in place.

Now they’re all panicking, running around, trying to unwedge the locker. Flames crawl up the wall and swim across the ceiling. The waterspouts spurt out a blip of water, kind of like someone gleeking. A couple of bubbles and sputters, and then the spouts shut off with a bang and a creaking moan.

“So how did you get the camera back?”

“Keep watching.”

The smoke is thick, but we can still see things falling from the ceiling and walls. The room pops and aches in the smoldering heat.

“Watch this. Apparently the wall behind the lockers fell backwards into the storage room. Some of the lockers fell backwards as well.”

The camera angle tips backwards, looking up at the ceiling. My locker slams the ground. The door flings open. The camera flips up into the air and falls down into the open locker. The door slams shut.

Darkness.

Their screams trail off as distant sirens can be heard.

“The fireman didn’t want me around, but I was able to sneak in. I got lucky. It was just a whimsical thought, a lucky guess that I even looked inside my locker. And there it was… a little melty around the edges, but the card still works… Crazy, huh?”

“Crazy.”

“Pretty good home movie, though, huh, Karl!”

Karl shrugs, “Well, huh, yeah. So, that’s one way to go.” Smiles. “I guess they shouldn’t’ve been rude to Robert.”",3,1770250678.0,nosleep,1,0.71,False

1qw5tg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rimmont/comments/1qw5tg1/i_found_a_beautiful_black_cat_i_shouldnt_have/,I found a beautiful black cat. I shouldn't have named it Rasputin.,"My mother died a little over six months ago. I lived with her, but she had been battling a cancer diagnosis for a couple of years. Unfortunately, the metastasis was inevitable, and she died after prolonged suffering. The funeral was beautiful. My mother's friends came from all over the country to say their final goodbyes.

When it was over, I went home—a tenth-floor apartment I rented with my mother but which she never used, having spent her last months in the hospital. Upon entering, there was a sepulchral silence; on the dining table was a vase with some flowers I had bought months earlier when the doctors said she was improving and would be back any day.

I left my briefcase on the table and felt my way to my room in the dark. I didn't want to turn on the lights because the exhaustion was shattering my legs. I felt a horrible emptiness in my chest, as if I had cried for entire months—and the truth is, I had. Although, I had seen so much suffering in her that deep in my heart, I longed for her to finally find rest.

The following days were the same as always. I'd get up, have a quick breakfast, and run to the metro to get to work. My office was in the farthest corner of the building, right next to the company's servers. Rarely did anyone greet me; there were days when I didn't even go in and no one noticed my absence. But I liked going to the office. I didn't want to be at home. Every day at home, I felt like Mom would walk in at any moment.

The only times I spoke to anyone at the office were when there was a server issue. In those cases, Mark from accounting or Jane from human resources would come by with excessive friendliness so I'd attend to their problem. There was a point where I had gone so long without speaking to anyone that I intentionally created a fault in a user's account, just to have someone to talk to.

And so the days passed without speaking to anyone, to the point where I no longer even looked at myself in the mirror before leaving the house. Until one ordinary day on my way home, I found that the building elevator had broken down. There was a white sign with blue details instructing residents to use the stairs while the technical issues were resolved. It was too many floors; I was grateful I hadn't gone grocery shopping that day, as it would have been an ordeal.

I started climbing. My legs hurt as I climbed the empty stairs at almost 11 PM. Suddenly, as I was reaching the seventh floor, I heard a cry. It sounded like a baby. At first, I ignored it, but the sound became clearer and more audible—it was a meow. But it wasn't just any meow; a kitten was crying out in desperation.

I opened the door separating the stairs from the hallway and saw the multiple doors stretching to the end, trying to identify where the sound was coming from. I saw a puddle of what seemed to be water at the far end. I walked slowly, watching as the motion-activated lights turned on one by one. When I was a few steps away, the light came on and the image was clear: the puddle was blood, and the meowing was coming from that door. I approached and tried to open it, but I couldn't.

I immediately ran down the stairs to the concierge desk and informed the only guard on duty. We went up together, and after getting permission from his boss, he used a master security key. The scene was horrific. There was a woman with a mutilated leg lying in a pool of blood. And on top of the woman was a little black kitten, a few months old, meowing desperately.

The poor creature came towards me and started purring while rubbing against my calves. I bent down to pick it up, and it looked at me with a tenderness that melted my heart. I held it to my chest, and it rubbed against my neck, alternating between purrs and meows of what seemed like pleasure.

The police arrived after about two hours. I took the cat up to my apartment; such a beautiful little creature had no business being in such a horrible place. A burly officer knocked on my door around 3 AM. I told him everything that had happened, and he asked if I knew the woman. I denied any relation to her; I didn't even know her name.

The officer asked about the cat. I told him it seemed to belong to the murdered woman but that I didn't want to leave it there because of the traumatic scene. The officer said he'd check with his squad whether they should take the cat or if I could keep it. At that moment, the cat puffed up at the officer and made that angry hissing face cats do.

I tried to sleep, but the cat snuggled right on top of my face, making it hard to breathe. But the animal was so beautiful I simply couldn't be angry with it. Early in the morning, I went to work. I tried to give it some water, as I had no food in the house to offer the kitten.

The day at the office was as long as any other, but I was particularly free of tasks, so I decided to leave a note on my desk with my phone number—""Call me if you need anything urgent""—grabbed my things, and left. Right across from my office, there happened to be a pet store. Upon entering, an older, gray-haired man with a mustache greeted me with great cheer.

""How can I help you?""

""Thank you. Look, the thing is, I have a kitten, a few months old, staying at my house for now. I'd like to know what's the most important thing I should have while I have him.""

""Of course,"" he said with a broad smile. ""The essential and most important things are three: a bed, a litter box, and, of course, food.""

I looked through the items and tried to buy a bed that would match the color of my sofa—after all, I didn't want it to clash. I also bought a litter box, a bag of unscented litter, a bag of kitten food, plus bowls for water and food. I also bought a little mouse toy; I didn't want the kitten to damage things in the house, but I didn't want him to get bored either.

Since I had so many bags, I decided to take a taxi and started thinking about everything I was missing: a scratching post, a carrier. Also, something extremely important was missing: a leash with a tag so he wouldn't get lost, and, of course, a name. What was I going to call him?

Normally, I'd stay silent for the entire taxi ride, but the driver, seeing me so loaded, said:

""So, new pet? A cat, right?""

""Yes, sir. It's a kitten I found...""—I couldn't describe the scene without a shudder—""Well, found on the street.""

""Cats are like that. They adopt you. What's his name?""

""Honestly, I haven't thought about it.""

""You could call him Rasputin. It's a name my grandmother always used for her cats. Usually for black cats.""

We chatted a bit more and quickly arrived at my place. As I said goodbye, I thanked him for the conversation and commented that I would indeed name my kitten Rasputin. When I entered the building, it was the same guard who had accompanied me on the day of the horrible scene.

""Hey, have you heard anything about the case? Do they know who's responsible?""

""From what I've heard, nothing yet. The police have come several times and taken evidence, but it seems they have no suspects yet.""

I took the elevator, grateful it was working again because I was carrying things. Upon reaching my floor, I could hear the meowing from the hallway. That sound filled my chest with warmth. Someone was waiting for me at home. I opened the apartment door, and the cat lunged at me. He was purring like crazy, and I dropped the things to hug him. I felt an intoxicating happiness.

""Rasputin,"" I said, and he immediately looked at me as if recognizing an old friend, but quickly changed his expression back to that of the usual sweet cat. ""Look what I brought you,"" and I showed him all the things.

""You must be starving, so I'll serve you some food.""

I arranged the things and served him some of the kibble the man at the pet store had given me. I put the food on the dining table because I had no other suitable spot. He approached curiously but simply sniffed the food with indifference. I guess you're not that hungry, I tried to convince him to eat, but he just got annoyed and ran off. My mistake, I bought the wrong food. It would be good to know what his previous owner fed him.

I ate a sandwich and went to bed, calling for Rasputin to join me, but he didn't even look at me. He was outside, staring out the window indifferently. It felt like a blow to the chest, but I tried to sleep. At this hour, I wouldn't find the right food anyway.

Upon waking, Rasputin was right beside me, sleeping in a ball. I tried to get up without waking him; I'd go look for food. Before leaving, I smelled something horrible, like rotten meat, and realized I hadn't cleaned the litter box. I got a bag from the kitchen and went to the litter box. There was a mound of almost a pound, covered in litter. This is too much for such a small cat. I wrapped it in the bag and took it to the outside trash.

I walked several blocks looking for kitten food. It turns out there are too many brands. I bought six small bags of food—two of the most expensive, two mid-range, and two budget. I also bought several canned foods, about four. I wanted to do a massive test; one of them had to appeal to him. I quickly returned home and put the food in little plastic cups I had bought for that purpose.

I put almost ten different foods in front of my cat and left him there to see which one he'd go for. He had to eat something; it had been almost two days without food, he was going to get sick. Rasputin approached and sniffed each container but ignored them all. He didn't even try them. He went to my bed, curled up, and lay down. No food interested him. My desperation was total. I don't know what to feed him. There has to be something he likes.

I decided to go to the butcher for something different. I bought a cut of meat from every animal I found: pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, fish, even a cut of venison the butcher offered me when he saw I was buying peculiarities. I got home and did the same routine. I offered him all the foods, but nothing worked.

""I give up,"" I said. Hunger will make him eat. So I finished my daily tasks and continued with my routine, but the kitten meowed intensely.

""What do you want? You don't like anything I give you. I don't know what to give you.""

The cat climbed onto my legs and started nibbling at my leg.

""Do you want to eat me? Haha, is that what you want?"" I put him down, and he walked away.

The next day, I tried arranging the food samples again, trying to keep everything fresh. My dining room had become a food display. There were almost twenty cups with different foods to see if any worked. I even put out some carrot and vegetables, to see if the little animal would respond to any of them.

I went to work, and upon returning, he still hadn't taken a bite and was meowing more and more desperately. I had already tried giving him almost every food, even asking the pet store owner, who recommended I take him to a vet because it could be some illness.

""If you don't eat anything today, Rasputin, we'll have to go to a vet.""

The cat puffed up in anger, just like with the policeman, and gave me that hissing face cats make when they're angry.

""What a temper.""

I started chopping vegetables for my dinner, but just as I was cutting the onion, the kitten ran towards me and nudged me. It was very gentle, but enough to make the knife slip a little and cut my hand. At that moment, I was annoyed that the vegetables were getting stained with blood, so I tried to wash them immediately, but the cat jumped onto the kitchen table, approached me, and licked my finger. How sweet, he's worried about me, I thought, and I petted him. The cat started purring again, and I felt the happiness that had overwhelmed me the first day.

""Well, at least you're eating something, haha.""

When I got to the bedroom, I disinfected the wound with some alcohol because, after all, it was a cat, and the wound could get infected. We slept snuggled up, and I felt companionship, warmth, and happiness.

The next day, I kept thinking about what had happened and thought that maybe what the kitten wanted was fresh prey. I understand some are hunters and prefer only fresh food. A somewhat far-fetched but possible idea occurred to me: I could bring a little mouse for the kitten to eat, a hamster, or even a small bird.

I decided to do it. I went to a pet store and bought a small mouse. I wanted it to be as small as possible. I put it in a box where I couldn't see it; I didn't want to get attached. It was just food for Rasputin.

When I got home, I showed him the animal. The cat sniffed it and then walked away indifferently. I closed the box and tried to think of how to get Rasputin's attention. I tried putting it near him. I tried closing us in a room and making the mouse run, but nothing worked. Then, at almost four in the afternoon, in the midst of desperation over not knowing how to respond to Rasputin, I grabbed the mouse and cut its head off in one slash.

The experience was chilling but somewhat liberating. I took the blood and put it on a plate. I offered it to Rasputin. He approached, sniffed a little, gave a couple of licks, and walked away. Well, it's something, I thought. I remembered I hadn't finished my tasks for the day and ran to complete as much as I could before time ran out. I sent them and kept thinking about how to respond to Rasputin's hunger.

Things didn't seem to be improving. My poor animal was skin and bones, and it was all my fault. I'm useless; I can't even have a pet. I was in the kitchen again, trying to prepare something to eat, and I remembered the scene with the knife, the mouse, and the blood. I thought while looking at the blade. I put my index finger right on the tip and almost without thinking, I made a jab. At first, my finger seemed intact, but then a red drop began to grow on my finger. I looked for Rasputin's plate and let about seven drops of blood fall into it.

At that instant, Rasputin jumped onto the plate and licked it as if it were a delicacy, then sought out my finger and licked it. The cat purred, curled around my legs, and climbed onto me. He was a happy animal again. I felt that I was happy too, and the pain in my finger vanished because of the great love I was receiving from the beautiful Rasputin.

In the following days, I went to a pharmacy and asked the clerk what was the best way to extract small amounts of blood. I also asked how much blood I could take without it affecting me. He gave me a syringe and some instructions. He said that for glucose tests, only a drop was necessary, and that I should be very careful to disinfect everything.

I arrived home happy. I sat on the sofa, took out all the instruments, drew a full syringe of blood, and served it on the plate. At that moment, Rasputin began to lick the plate with incredible happiness. I tried to touch him, but he reacted with anger. I understand, I understand, what a temper. After drinking the blood, he purred a little and rubbed against me but then walked away.

This act gradually became routine. I'd extract a little blood, give it to him, he'd eat, and I'd go on with my day. I had to invest in supplements and more food because I was losing energy. There were days when I felt dizzy. But Rasputin's love made everything worth it. After a couple of weeks, everything was beautiful. He was happy, I was happy, and everything was going wonderfully. But when I arrived at the building, the police were there. They indicated they had to search for information about the crime. 

They asked to check my apartment, and upon seeing Rasputin, who was plump, I said, ""Look, this is my 'larger feline.'"" The officer saw the syringes in the kitchen and asked me why I had them. I became a bundle of nerves and said the first thing that came to mind.

""That's because, because... that's because, that's because I have... sugar problems.""

""For glucose tests, it's just drops.""

""Yes, the thing is... the thing is... my device doesn't work well, so I have to use more blood.""

""I see,"" said the officer. ""Let me see it. My nephew is diabetic; I could help you adjust it.""

""No, no, I have it put away, and why bother? Besides, you have a jaguar or a tiger to find, don't you?""

The officer left, and I quickly went to the kitchen to get the syringe. I was an hour late with Rasputin's feeding. I drew almost double the blood from the first time and got dizzy, but this time, Rasputin responded with the same cold indifference as the first time. It destroyed me. I kept thinking about it. I don't know what to do. I tried extracting more, but the animal didn't respond.

In the midst of desperation over not knowing how to respond and Rasputin's coldness, I looked in the kitchen for the sharpest knife. I tried to find the meatiest part of my leg and cut into it with one slash. It was just a few centimeters of flesh, but my beautiful Rasputin responded with great happiness and devoured it eagerly.

Three weeks passed, and I had to keep cutting carefully, disinfecting and sealing the edges so I wouldn't bleed out. It's meticulous, clockwork-like work: a balance. Rasputin was radiant. His black fur shone like tar under the dining room light, and his purrs were deep, satisfied—the engine of my world. When he looked at the fresh bandage, his golden eyes would dilate with an interest that made me smile.

But one night, Rasputin's hunger was unbearable. His meows were no longer complaints, but a low, guttural growl that didn't come from a small animal. When I turned on the light, his shadow on the wall wasn't that of a kitten, but of a hunched creature with a hump and disproportionately long limbs. His eyes, fixed on me, gleamed with an ancient, hungry intelligence. 'More,' a voice whispered—not a meow, but a rasping sound that came from its throat.

It was then I knew I wasn't feeding a pet, but a parasite that had adopted the most convenient form to trap me. Before I could react, Rasputin leaped from the table. Not with a cat's agility, but with the disjointed, swift movement of an insect. His legs, now long and thin like black rods, pinned me to the floor. I felt its breath, which smelled of old blood and cemetery earth, on my face. 'The thigh now,' that shredded voice whispered, as one of its claws settled, cold as metal, on the bandage on my leg.

I couldn't believe it. My beautiful cat was actually a monster. It can't be. This must be a lie. But it lunged at me and licked my neck; I felt it would bite me that instant, but I found the knife nearby and plunged it into the creature's side. The entity emitted a shriek of pain and jumped away. At that moment, it tried to transform back into a cat, making eyes full of suffering, seeking my remorse. But the transformation failed; it flickered like an old television between the horrible image of the monster and that of the beautiful kitten.

I felt as if my life had been destroyed. The only beautiful thing was actually a monster. It can't be. This monster must have eaten my beautiful Rasputin. Or maybe it's just mimicking him; it saw that I love my cat and took his form to deceive me. I ran down the stairs at full speed, my eyes filled with tears, stumbling from the damage done to my leg.

I'm writing this from a cold interrogation room at the police station. The smell of stale coffee and disinfectant can't mask the sickly-sweet stench of my own infected flesh. Paramedics arrived at the building and found me on the stairs losing blood, the knife still in my hand. They say I was screaming something about a shadow with a hump. The police searched the entire apartment; they found no sign of Rasputin.

They don't believe what I tell them. I show them the bandages on my legs, I tell them about the shredded voice and the elongated shadow on the wall. They nod with compassion, noting ""delirium"" in their report. One of the officers recognized me. He asked if I was the man who was there when they found the dead woman. Now they think I did it, so they're calling my lawyer.

But I know the truth. It was the monster.

After 3 years of very diligent research and work, it's gotten much better.

However, we have a coffee table in the living room that he constantly gets his toys stuck under. The first time this happened, we asked if he needed help and he was behaving like his normal silly self. until we got our hands under the table. he then started growling and warning us and we backed off. 



But today when my gf reached under the table to get hit toy, he bit her. No warning that she could see. Then she grabbed him by the scruff to ask him to let go, he bit that hand and then the first arm again.

She asked him to get in his crate which he did, but snarled and snapped when she went to close the latches.

To be clear, since the first time it happened, every time after, for about a year now, we take it very slow and watch him and as soon as he says ""no I don't like that,"" we immediately back up and reassure him that it's ok.

After a while, we could be less apprehensive but still, asked his permission, made sure he was ok with it, and that he understood that we weren't taking it, but giving it to him.

And most of the time I could simply say, ""you want me to get it buddy?"" And he would paw slap and lay down which, so far, meant, ""yes you can get It but I'm still gonna watch you.""

Then suddenly today he bit her enough to break skin.

What signs should we be looking for besides the obvious, because a dramatic and sudden temperamental shift back to before all of the work we've done, seems a bit unsettling.",1,1770250468.0,greatpyrenees,0,1.0,False

1qw5sq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qw5sq1/i_found_a_beautiful_black_cat_i_shouldnt_have/,I found a beautiful black cat. I shouldn't have named it Rasputin.,"My mother died a little over six months ago. I lived with her, but she had been battling a cancer diagnosis for a couple of years. Unfortunately, the metastasis was inevitable, and she died after prolonged suffering. The funeral was beautiful. My mother's friends came from all over the country to say their final goodbyes. 

When it was over, I went home—a tenth-floor apartment I rented with my mother but which she never used, having spent her last months in the hospital. Upon entering, there was a sepulchral silence; on the dining table was a vase with some flowers I had bought months earlier when the doctors said she was improving and would be back any day.

I left my briefcase on the table and felt my way to my room in the dark. I didn't want to turn on the lights because the exhaustion was shattering my legs. I felt a horrible emptiness in my chest, as if I had cried for entire months—and the truth is, I had. Although, I had seen so much suffering in her that deep in my heart, I longed for her to finally find rest.

The following days were the same as always. I'd get up, have a quick breakfast, and run to the metro to get to work. My office was in the farthest corner of the building, right next to the company's servers. Rarely did anyone greet me; there were days when I didn't even go in and no one noticed my absence. But I liked going to the office. I didn't want to be at home. Every day at home, I felt like Mom would walk in at any moment.

The only times I spoke to anyone at the office were when there was a server issue. In those cases, Mark from accounting or Jane from human resources would come by with excessive friendliness so I'd attend to their problem. There was a point where I had gone so long without speaking to anyone that I intentionally created a fault in a user's account, just to have someone to talk to.

And so the days passed without speaking to anyone, to the point where I no longer even looked at myself in the mirror before leaving the house. Until one ordinary day on my way home, I found that the building elevator had broken down. There was a white sign with blue details instructing residents to use the stairs while the technical issues were resolved. It was too many floors; I was grateful I hadn't gone grocery shopping that day, as it would have been an ordeal.

I started climbing. My legs hurt as I climbed the empty stairs at almost 11 PM. Suddenly, as I was reaching the seventh floor, I heard a cry. It sounded like a baby. At first, I ignored it, but the sound became clearer and more audible—it was a meow. But it wasn't just any meow; a kitten was crying out in desperation.

I opened the door separating the stairs from the hallway and saw the multiple doors stretching to the end, trying to identify where the sound was coming from. I saw a puddle of what seemed to be water at the far end. I walked slowly, watching as the motion-activated lights turned on one by one. When I was a few steps away, the light came on and the image was clear: the puddle was blood, and the meowing was coming from that door. I approached and tried to open it, but I couldn't.

I immediately ran down the stairs to the concierge desk and informed the only guard on duty. We went up together, and after getting permission from his boss, he used a master security key. The scene was horrific. There was a woman with a mutilated leg lying in a pool of blood. And on top of the woman was a little black kitten, a few months old, meowing desperately.

The poor creature came towards me and started purring while rubbing against my calves. I bent down to pick it up, and it looked at me with a tenderness that melted my heart. I held it to my chest, and it rubbed against my neck, alternating between purrs and meows of what seemed like pleasure.

The police arrived after about two hours. I took the cat up to my apartment; such a beautiful little creature had no business being in such a horrible place. A burly officer knocked on my door around 3 AM. I told him everything that had happened, and he asked if I knew the woman. I denied any relation to her; I didn't even know her name.

The officer asked about the cat. I told him it seemed to belong to the murdered woman but that I didn't want to leave it there because of the traumatic scene. The officer said he'd check with his squad whether they should take the cat or if I could keep it. At that moment, the cat puffed up at the officer and made that angry hissing face cats do.

I tried to sleep, but the cat snuggled right on top of my face, making it hard to breathe. But the animal was so beautiful I simply couldn't be angry with it. Early in the morning, I went to work. I tried to give it some water, as I had no food in the house to offer the kitten.

The day at the office was as long as any other, but I was particularly free of tasks, so I decided to leave a note on my desk with my phone number—""Call me if you need anything urgent""—grabbed my things, and left. Right across from my office, there happened to be a pet store. Upon entering, an older, gray-haired man with a mustache greeted me with great cheer.

""How can I help you?""

""Thank you. Look, the thing is, I have a kitten, a few months old, staying at my house for now. I'd like to know what's the most important thing I should have while I have him.""

""Of course,"" he said with a broad smile. ""The essential and most important things are three: a bed, a litter box, and, of course, food.""

I looked through the items and tried to buy a bed that would match the color of my sofa—after all, I didn't want it to clash. I also bought a litter box, a bag of unscented litter, a bag of kitten food, plus bowls for water and food. I also bought a little mouse toy; I didn't want the kitten to damage things in the house, but I didn't want him to get bored either.

Since I had so many bags, I decided to take a taxi and started thinking about everything I was missing: a scratching post, a carrier. Also, something extremely important was missing: a leash with a tag so he wouldn't get lost, and, of course, a name. What was I going to call him?

Normally, I'd stay silent for the entire taxi ride, but the driver, seeing me so loaded, said:

""So, new pet? A cat, right?""

""Yes, sir. It's a kitten I found...""—I couldn't describe the scene without a shudder—""Well, found on the street.""

""Cats are like that. They adopt you. What's his name?""

""Honestly, I haven't thought about it.""

""You could call him Rasputin. It's a name my grandmother always used for her cats. Usually for black cats.""

We chatted a bit more and quickly arrived at my place. As I said goodbye, I thanked him for the conversation and commented that I would indeed name my kitten Rasputin. When I entered the building, it was the same guard who had accompanied me on the day of the horrible scene.

""Hey, have you heard anything about the case? Do they know who's responsible?""

""From what I've heard, nothing yet. The police have come several times and taken evidence, but it seems they have no suspects yet.""

I took the elevator, grateful it was working again because I was carrying things. Upon reaching my floor, I could hear the meowing from the hallway. That sound filled my chest with warmth. Someone was waiting for me at home. I opened the apartment door, and the cat lunged at me. He was purring like crazy, and I dropped the things to hug him. I felt an intoxicating happiness.

""Rasputin,"" I said, and he immediately looked at me as if recognizing an old friend, but quickly changed his expression back to that of the usual sweet cat. ""Look what I brought you,"" and I showed him all the things.

""You must be starving, so I'll serve you some food.""

I arranged the things and served him some of the kibble the man at the pet store had given me. I put the food on the dining table because I had no other suitable spot. He approached curiously but simply sniffed the food with indifference. I guess you're not that hungry, I tried to convince him to eat, but he just got annoyed and ran off. My mistake, I bought the wrong food. It would be good to know what his previous owner fed him.

I ate a sandwich and went to bed, calling for Rasputin to join me, but he didn't even look at me. He was outside, staring out the window indifferently. It felt like a blow to the chest, but I tried to sleep. At this hour, I wouldn't find the right food anyway.

Upon waking, Rasputin was right beside me, sleeping in a ball. I tried to get up without waking him; I'd go look for food. Before leaving, I smelled something horrible, like rotten meat, and realized I hadn't cleaned the litter box. I got a bag from the kitchen and went to the litter box. There was a mound of almost a pound, covered in litter. This is too much for such a small cat. I wrapped it in the bag and took it to the outside trash.

I walked several blocks looking for kitten food. It turns out there are too many brands. I bought six small bags of food—two of the most expensive, two mid-range, and two budget. I also bought several canned foods, about four. I wanted to do a massive test; one of them had to appeal to him. I quickly returned home and put the food in little plastic cups I had bought for that purpose.

I put almost ten different foods in front of my cat and left him there to see which one he'd go for. He had to eat something; it had been almost two days without food, he was going to get sick. Rasputin approached and sniffed each container but ignored them all. He didn't even try them. He went to my bed, curled up, and lay down. No food interested him. My desperation was total. I don't know what to feed him. There has to be something he likes.

I decided to go to the butcher for something different. I bought a cut of meat from every animal I found: pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, fish, even a cut of venison the butcher offered me when he saw I was buying peculiarities. I got home and did the same routine. I offered him all the foods, but nothing worked.

""I give up,"" I said. Hunger will make him eat. So I finished my daily tasks and continued with my routine, but the kitten meowed intensely.

""What do you want? You don't like anything I give you. I don't know what to give you.""

The cat climbed onto my legs and started nibbling at my leg.

""Do you want to eat me? Haha, is that what you want?"" I put him down, and he walked away.

The next day, I tried arranging the food samples again, trying to keep everything fresh. My dining room had become a food display. There were almost twenty cups with different foods to see if any worked. I even put out some carrot and vegetables, to see if the little animal would respond to any of them.

I went to work, and upon returning, he still hadn't taken a bite and was meowing more and more desperately. I had already tried giving him almost every food, even asking the pet store owner, who recommended I take him to a vet because it could be some illness.

""If you don't eat anything today, Rasputin, we'll have to go to a vet.""

The cat puffed up in anger, just like with the policeman, and gave me that hissing face cats make when they're angry.

""What a temper.""

I started chopping vegetables for my dinner, but just as I was cutting the onion, the kitten ran towards me and nudged me. It was very gentle, but enough to make the knife slip a little and cut my hand. At that moment, I was annoyed that the vegetables were getting stained with blood, so I tried to wash them immediately, but the cat jumped onto the kitchen table, approached me, and licked my finger. How sweet, he's worried about me, I thought, and I petted him. The cat started purring again, and I felt the happiness that had overwhelmed me the first day.

""Well, at least you're eating something, haha.""

When I got to the bedroom, I disinfected the wound with some alcohol because, after all, it was a cat, and the wound could get infected. We slept snuggled up, and I felt companionship, warmth, and happiness.

The next day, I kept thinking about what had happened and thought that maybe what the kitten wanted was fresh prey. I understand some are hunters and prefer only fresh food. A somewhat far-fetched but possible idea occurred to me: I could bring a little mouse for the kitten to eat, a hamster, or even a small bird.

I decided to do it. I went to a pet store and bought a small mouse. I wanted it to be as small as possible. I put it in a box where I couldn't see it; I didn't want to get attached. It was just food for Rasputin.

When I got home, I showed him the animal. The cat sniffed it and then walked away indifferently. I closed the box and tried to think of how to get Rasputin's attention. I tried putting it near him. I tried closing us in a room and making the mouse run, but nothing worked. Then, at almost four in the afternoon, in the midst of desperation over not knowing how to respond to Rasputin, I grabbed the mouse and cut its head off in one slash.

The experience was chilling but somewhat liberating. I took the blood and put it on a plate. I offered it to Rasputin. He approached, sniffed a little, gave a couple of licks, and walked away. Well, it's something, I thought. I remembered I hadn't finished my tasks for the day and ran to complete as much as I could before time ran out. I sent them and kept thinking about how to respond to Rasputin's hunger.

Things didn't seem to be improving. My poor animal was skin and bones, and it was all my fault. I'm useless; I can't even have a pet. I was in the kitchen again, trying to prepare something to eat, and I remembered the scene with the knife, the mouse, and the blood. I thought while looking at the blade. I put my index finger right on the tip and almost without thinking, I made a jab. At first, my finger seemed intact, but then a red drop began to grow on my finger. I looked for Rasputin's plate and let about seven drops of blood fall into it.

At that instant, Rasputin jumped onto the plate and licked it as if it were a delicacy, then sought out my finger and licked it. The cat purred, curled around my legs, and climbed onto me. He was a happy animal again. I felt that I was happy too, and the pain in my finger vanished because of the great love I was receiving from the beautiful Rasputin.

In the following days, I went to a pharmacy and asked the clerk what was the best way to extract small amounts of blood. I also asked how much blood I could take without it affecting me. He gave me a syringe and some instructions. He said that for glucose tests, only a drop was necessary, and that I should be very careful to disinfect everything.

I arrived home happy. I sat on the sofa, took out all the instruments, drew a full syringe of blood, and served it on the plate. At that moment, Rasputin began to lick the plate with incredible happiness. I tried to touch him, but he reacted with anger. I understand, I understand, what a temper. After drinking the blood, he purred a little and rubbed against me but then walked away.

This act gradually became routine. I'd extract a little blood, give it to him, he'd eat, and I'd go on with my day. I had to invest in supplements and more food because I was losing energy. There were days when I felt dizzy. But Rasputin's love made everything worth it. After a couple of weeks, everything was beautiful. He was happy, I was happy, and everything was going wonderfully. But when I arrived at the building, the police were there. They indicated they had to search for information about the crime. 

They asked to check my apartment, and upon seeing Rasputin, who was plump, I said, ""Look, this is my 'larger feline.'"" The officer saw the syringes in the kitchen and asked me why I had them. I became a bundle of nerves and said the first thing that came to mind.

""That's because, because... that's because, that's because I have... sugar problems.""

""For glucose tests, it's just drops.""

""Yes, the thing is... the thing is... my device doesn't work well, so I have to use more blood.""

""I see,"" said the officer. ""Let me see it. My nephew is diabetic; I could help you adjust it.""

""No, no, I have it put away, and why bother? Besides, you have a jaguar or a tiger to find, don't you?""

The officer left, and I quickly went to the kitchen to get the syringe. I was an hour late with Rasputin's feeding. I drew almost double the blood from the first time and got dizzy, but this time, Rasputin responded with the same cold indifference as the first time. It destroyed me. I kept thinking about it. I don't know what to do. I tried extracting more, but the animal didn't respond.

In the midst of desperation over not knowing how to respond and Rasputin's coldness, I looked in the kitchen for the sharpest knife. I tried to find the meatiest part of my leg and cut into it with one slash. It was just a few centimeters of flesh, but my beautiful Rasputin responded with great happiness and devoured it eagerly.

Three weeks passed, and I had to keep cutting carefully, disinfecting and sealing the edges so I wouldn't bleed out. It's meticulous, clockwork-like work: a balance. Rasputin was radiant. His black fur shone like tar under the dining room light, and his purrs were deep, satisfied—the engine of my world. When he looked at the fresh bandage, his golden eyes would dilate with an interest that made me smile.

But one night, Rasputin's hunger was unbearable. His meows were no longer complaints, but a low, guttural growl that didn't come from a small animal. When I turned on the light, his shadow on the wall wasn't that of a kitten, but of a hunched creature with a hump and disproportionately long limbs. His eyes, fixed on me, gleamed with an ancient, hungry intelligence. 'More,' a voice whispered—not a meow, but a rasping sound that came from its throat.

It was then I knew I wasn't feeding a pet, but a parasite that had adopted the most convenient form to trap me. Before I could react, Rasputin leaped from the table. Not with a cat's agility, but with the disjointed, swift movement of an insect. His legs, now long and thin like black rods, pinned me to the floor. I felt its breath, which smelled of old blood and cemetery earth, on my face. 'The thigh now,' that shredded voice whispered, as one of its claws settled, cold as metal, on the bandage on my leg.

I couldn't believe it. My beautiful cat was actually a monster. It can't be. This must be a lie. But it lunged at me and licked my neck; I felt it would bite me that instant, but I found the knife nearby and plunged it into the creature's side. The entity emitted a shriek of pain and jumped away. At that moment, it tried to transform back into a cat, making eyes full of suffering, seeking my remorse. But the transformation failed; it flickered like an old television between the horrible image of the monster and that of the beautiful kitten.

Or maybe it's just mimicking him; it saw that I love my cat and took his form to deceive me. I ran down the stairs at full speed, my eyes filled with tears, stumbling from the damage done to my leg.

1qw5rsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_pacsun1980/comments/1qw5rsm/winter_2025_trend_report_the_aesthetic_looks_gen/,Winter 2025 Trend Report: The Aesthetic Looks Gen Z Is Actually Wearing (Women’s Edition),"Winter 2025 is not about sad beige and “I gave up” hoodies. This season is loud, cozy, and very main-character coded. Think faux fur, pleated minis, IT-girl tights, flared pants, ribbed knits, and baggy sweats styled like you’re always on camera.

Gen Z and Gen Alpha are mixing comfort, nostalgia, and aesthetic-core dressing in a way that actually works for real life: campus, coffee runs, nights out, trips home, and everything in between.

Here are 10 aesthetic winter outfits people are actually wearing, not just pinning.

# 1. “Mob Wife Lite” – Faux Fur, But Make It Campus-Friendly

The full “mob wife” look is extra: big faux fur, animal prints, heavy gold jewelry, and “I have a driver” energy. Winter 2025 keeps the drama, but dials it down into something you can actually wear to class, brunch, or a movie night.

**The vibe:**  
Hot-girl winter, but you still have a 9 a.m. lecture. Cozy base, dramatic coat, practical shoes.

**How to build it with Pacsun women’s pieces:**

Throw on an Edikted faux-fur or teddy jacket from Pacsun’s women’s outerwear for that over-the-top, “don’t talk to me, I’m important” energy.

Pair it with the Pacsun Bella Stretch Dark Indigo Mid Rise Denim Mini Skirt for a Y2K nod that still feels 2025.

Add sheer black tights and boots so your legs don’t actually freeze.

Finish the look with an LA Hearts Faux Fur Pom Beanie and chunky jewelry to keep it extra without going full costume.

**Pro tip:** Keep the base outfit simple (solid tops, classic denim) and let the jacket do all the screaming.

# 2. Campus Prep 2.0 – Ivy-Core, But Make It TikTok

Prep is back, but it’s not stiff or old-money. It’s varsity-inspired, a little crunchy, and styled like you actually live in your clothes.

**The vibe:**  
You look like you’re on your way to a study group at an elite uni, but you filmed a GRWM in the bathroom five minutes ago.

**How to build it:**

Start with a HYPE & VICE Ivy Knit Cropped Sweater (Notre Dame, Miami, Georgia, Oregon, etc.). The collegiate logos + cropped fit = instant campus-core.

Pair it with an LA Hearts Pleated Mini Skirt in tan, black, or charcoal for that modern school-girl feel.

Add tights for warmth and finish with New Balance sneakers from the women’s brand lineup for sporty main character energy.

Toss everything under a long coat or puffer from the Women’s Gift Guide and you’re fully winter-ready.

**Pro tip:** A big tote, messy bun, and wired headphones complete the “I live in the library” aesthetic.

# 3. Cozy Coquette – Cardigans, Lace, and “Soft Girl in the Snow”

Coquette-core is still a thing for Winter 2025, just upgraded with heavier fabrics and smart layering so you don’t freeze for the aesthetic.

**The vibe:**  
Balletcore meets winter cabin. Soft, romantic, a little nostalgic, but still practical.

**How to build it:**

Make the Beverly & Beck Marley Cardigan your star layering piece. It’s slouchy, soft, and looks like you write poetry in cafés.

Pair with a Your Favorite Lace Maxi Skirt or Lace Flowy Mini Skirt to bring in that flirty, coquette texture.

Layer a Your Favorite Waffle Knit Long Sleeve Top underneath the cardigan for extra warmth and structure.

Finish the look with tights, dainty jewelry (Ana Luisa and Third Charm pieces from the gift guide are perfect), and Mary Janes or ankle boots.

**Pro tip:** Stick to soft colors (cream, blush, pale grey) and mix lace + knit textures to nail that winter coquette vibe.

# 4. Y2K Night-Out – Denim Mini + Cute Top Agenda

The “cute top + mini skirt + giant coat” combo is still undefeated for going out. Winter 2025’s version leans into Y2K silhouettes with slightly more grown-up styling.

**The vibe:**  
You’re going out, it’s definitely freezing, but the coat will handle it.

**How to build it:**

Start with the Pacsun Bella Stretch Dark Indigo Mid Rise Denim Mini Skirt as your base. It’s classic, easy to style, and very Y2K-coded.

Swap flimsy crop tops for a Your Favorite Waffle Knit Long Sleeve Top to stay warm while still serving.

Add sheer tights and boots or heeled loafers.

Throw a big puffer or faux-fur jacket from the Women’s Gift Guide over everything for the commute.

**Pro tip:** Play with textures (waffle knit, denim, faux fur) instead of neon colors to keep it 2025 instead of costume-Y2K.

# 5. Chunky Knit + Maxi Skirt = Coffee Shop Main Character

Maxi skirts are having a huge moment, especially in lace, denim, and tiered woven fabrics. Paired with a chunky knit, you get peak “I live at the coffee shop” energy.

**The vibe:**  
You look like you’re about to write the next great novel on your laptop in the corner of an indie café.

**How to build it:**

On top, grab a Your Favorite Snug Waffle Knit Sweater – chunky, cozy, and made for half-tucks.

On the bottom, go for:

A Beverly & Beck White Tiered Maxi Skirt for a soft, boho feel, or

A Your Favorite Lace Maxi Skirt for a dreamy, ethereal aesthetic.

Add heeled ankle boots or platform sneakers and a big scarf.

**Pro tip:** Mix one “floaty” piece (tiered or lace maxi) with one “chunky” piece (knit sweater) for instant visual interest.

# 6. Oversized Streetwear – “I Just Threw This On” Baggy Sweats

If Gen Z had a national uniform, it would be baggy sweats and an oversized hoodie. Winter 2025 keeps that going with ultra-baggy fits and washed fleece.

**The vibe:**  
You rolled out of bed, but somehow look like a streetwear Pinterest board.

**How to build it:**

Start with Pacsun Solid Fleece Baggy Sweatpants in a neutral shade for a soft, slouchy base.

Or go loud with Pacsun Camo Fleece Extreme Baggy Sweatpants if your FYP is full of streetwear fits.

Add a matching Pacsun Core Crew Neck Sweatshirt or Core Washed Pullover Hoodie for that elevated matching-set feel.

Finish with chunky sneakers and a structured long coat to make it look intentional.

**Pro tip:** Sleek hair, simple makeup, and a crossbody bag instantly level up sweats from “lazy” to “off-duty model.”

# 7. Flare Pants & Ribbed Sweaters – 70s, But TikTok Approved

Flare pants are a big Winter 2025 story, especially in soft, stretchy fabrics that feel like loungewear but look like outfits.

**The vibe:**  
You stole your mom’s 70s silhouette, then styled it like your FYP.

**How to build it:**

Start with John Galt Priscilla Flare Pants in navy, black, silver, or pink. They’re high-rise, comfy, and flare perfectly at the ankle.

On top, go for fitted knits like the Your Favorite Snug Waffle Knit Sweater or a slim long-sleeve top.

Add platform sneakers or heeled boots and a mini shoulder bag.

**Pro tip:** Dark flares + a lighter top = instant leg-lengthening optical illusion. You’re welcome.

# 8. Skirt + Tights + Retro Sneakers – The IT Girl Winter Formula

The unofficial Gen Z winter uniform: cute skirt, tights, and retro sneakers. It’s comfy enough for long days but still looks like an outfit.

**The vibe:**  
You’re late to class, but you still did a fit check in the mirror.

**How to build it:**

Choose your skirt:

LA Hearts Pleated Mini Skirt for sporty-prep vibes,

Your Favorite Lace Flowy Mini Skirt for coquette energy, or

A Pacsun Cargo Midi Skirt if you’re living your utility-core fantasy.

Add opaque or sheer tights depending on how cold it is.

Throw on New Balance or Reebok sneakers for that retro runner look.

Finish the top half with an Ivy-inspired knit, John Galt hoodie, or simple fitted long sleeve.

**Pro tip:** Swap plain tights for subtle patterns (polka dots, tiny hearts) when you want the outfit to feel more “Pinterest board” than “basic.”

# 9. Accessories That Do The Most – Beanies, Socks, and Extras

Winter 2025 is very “more is more” when it comes to styling. Accessories are how you shift your base wardrobe between aesthetics without buying 40 new coats.

**The vibe:**  
Same coat, entirely different personality depending on the accessories.

**What to grab from Pacsun:**

LA Hearts Faux Fur Pom Beanie for instant cozy-girl TikTok energy.

Cute socks from New Balance, Vans, or Pacsun to peek out over boots or sneakers.

Layered necklaces, rings, and earrings from Ana Luisa and Third Charm to stack over turtlenecks and under collars.

Belts and small shoulder bags to break up oversized silhouettes.

**Pro tip:** Pick one “accent color” (like red, baby blue, or chocolate brown) and repeat it in your hat, scarf, socks, and bag. It’ll make your fits look super cohesive with almost no effort.

# 10. Alpine Après-Ski Girl – Puffer, Knit & “Snow Bunny But Chill”

Skicore and après-ski inspired outfits are a huge winter mood, even if the only slope you’re hitting is the sidewalk outside your dorm.

**The vibe:**  
You look like you just left the ski lodge, but you’re really just grabbing a latte.

**How to build it:**

Start with a cozy base like the Your Favorite Waffle Knit Long Sleeve Top – warm, textured, and perfect for layering.

Add the Beverly & Beck Marley Cardigan on top for that chalet-by-the-fireplace feel.

Swap basic leggings for Pacsun ribbed flare pants or another pair of women’s flares so it feels “après-ski chic” instead of “gym.”

Top it all with a statement puffer or faux-fur coat from the Women’s Gift Guide and a beanie or earmuffs.

Finish with thick socks and snow boots or chunky sneakers.

**Pro tip:** Stick to tonal color stories (all creams, all browns, or glacier blues) and add sporty sunglasses. Suddenly you’re the main character of a snow trip vlog, even if you’ve never touched a ski lift.

# Final Thoughts

Winter 2025 is all about vibe-based dressing: mob wife lite, campus prep, coquette, Y2K night-out, coffee-shop main character, streetwear, flares, IT-girl tights, maximal accessories, and après-ski.

The easiest way to play with all of these? Start with a few key Pacsun women’s pieces – the right skirt, a couple of flares, a statement jacket, and some good knits – then use accessories to switch aesthetics on demand.

1qw5rme,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1qw5rme/is_there_anything_that_actually_works/,Is there anything that actually works?,"I have severe depression and (diagnosed) OCD. With OCD I'm getting better thanks to ERP therapy, but depression is still there (so I assume it's not a consequence of OCD, but it's just a co-occurring disease. I have tried almost anything, nothing works.

Not medication, not therapy (I've tried manyy kinds of therapy. The OCD one is working for OCD, but nothing helps with depression), not CBD oil (not even if I take exaggerated amounts), not 5htp, not physical exercise, not sunlight, not eating healthier foods, nothing. Even coffee doesn't have any effect on me.

I struggle A LOT with executive dysfunction. To the point where it happens that I can't even put on a pad when I'm on my period, can't leave the house, can't do almost anything.

The only way that I can do things is if I have high adrenaline (like, the compulsions I could do them as they come from the OCD's feeling of urgency and danger. Without that feeling, I can't do anything).

The only thing that actually works a little is SH. If I need to do something, to be able to do the task I SH and so the executive dysfunction melts and I can do it. (Little problem: I have to go deeper every time otherwise it won't work)

Executive dysfunction also prevents me from going to bed early, so these days I'm only able to go to bed aroun 7-8 AM.

I've also always struggled with insomnia, so even when I went to bed early, I still couldn't sleep for hours. Probably that played a role in making me absolutely hate going to bed.

Also, for about two years I couldn't talk due to muscular tension in my throat (caused by anxiety), which made it hurt as hell anytime I'd try to talk. Now I'm recovering thanks to a speech-doctor.

I started isolating as I couldn't talk and because of that my friends would just ignore me, or they would get triggered by my bad mental health. Nowadays executive dysfunction prevents me from meeting people, going out, my house is a mess, can't do basic self care.

A year ago, I posted here and started following this sub even though I’m in a low paying job. I wanted to become HENRY in the decade and tried to mimic how people in HENRYUK think and talk.

Today I’m possibly making it! I have interviewed for a management roles paying over 32k a month, and I have been rejected by many. But finally! I got THE notification last evening after my classes(I’m taking night classes after work to enrich myself)!

Here’s the catch. This job has initially rejected me after our second interview even though they think I’m a good fit because the other candidate fits their salary expectations. Today I was told that the person they picked didn’t work out and they want to invite me for a coffee to discuss my start date. This will possibly be my first salary negotiation that mattered ever and I would like to ask for some tips and tricks on what I can prepare!

1qw5qq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorSuspenseTerror/comments/1qw5qq4/flypaper/,Flypaper,"It wasn’t every day. They tried to be clever about it; you know, mixing things up a bit. They’d do it one day, but then not the next two. Maybe every other day for a week, then they’d skip a few days in a row, but never a whole week. They couldn’t go a whole week. I don’t think they could wait that long. Couldn’t resist the urge, the grubby little bastards. Anyway, it was those delays, the spaced-out randomness. That’s why it took me a minute to figure out who it was.

At first I thought it was Billy. He was always an ass to me. Mouthing off, showing off, trying to put me down or embarrass me in front of the rest of them. Actually, I kinda wish it was him. I’d love to lay all the blame on him, but it wasn’t him.

Then there’s that crabby old bastard, Henry. What a peach he is, always ragging on everybody as if they’re not doing enough to pull their own weight.

Of course, Sue believes everything Henry says. He’s her little tattletale. And she makes out the schedule according to whatever little gossip those two shit-heels are talking about.

Honestly, it shouldn’t have surprised me that it was Samantha… “Sam and Tam.” Samantha and her sycophantic little tagalong, Tammy. “Oh, look at Sam and Tam. They’re so cute. They wore matching blouses today. They smell so good. Their hair is so pretty.”

Makes me wanna puke. Sam and Tam were those manipulative, bouncy, bubblegum-chewing, cutesy girls that always got their way. Mostly, because everyone was always intimidated by them or wanted to be close to them. If you were in their way, they’d knock you down and make it look like an accident. While no one else was looking, they’d smirk at you with one of those snide little “Ha, ha smiles”— just to let you know that they were reveling in it.

I called them the wonder twins. As in, “I wonder if they’re going to do any work today?” They were so spoiled.

If Sue saw me notice Sam and Tam slacking off, she wouldn’t get after them. Oh no… she’d scold me. “Robert, if you have time to criticize Sam and Tam, then you’re not doing your job. Now, get back to work ya slacker!”

Anyway, I was tired of whoever it was helping themselves to whatever they wanted from my lunch in the locker room. It was my turn. This time I would get the last laugh.

So the trick was, I needed something that would last, something that could sit in there for a few days without going bad. I also wanted to see it happen. So I had those two obstacles to overcome in order to achieve my ultimate goal.

The first one was easy. I’d go with the tried and true, the dependable, a good old tray of brownies. No need to be super creative with the bait. It’s not like I was trying to reinvent the wheel or anything.

The second obstacle was a little bit harder. How do I watch? When pulling off something this elaborate, you gotta be able to see what happens. And I was definitely going to be able to see the results.

The question was, how? Do I try to time things just right, hide in an unused locker or up in the drop ceiling, and peek through the vent holes? Do I drill out a peephole through the wall that lines up with my locker from the storage room on the other side? Do I burst into the room and catch them in the act on camera? And there it was — a camera. I needed a camera. Except I wasn’t going to burst into the room. I didn’t need to.

I found one of those $20 body cams and put a 64 gig card in it. That sucker recorded for five hours straight. You couldn’t hardly even see it peeking out over the top of my locker.

It was a beautiful thing, you know — the moment of truth — when it happened. That cheap little camera takes an amazing picture. Honestly, I’m kinda shocked at how good it looks for the price. The fact is, it’s a miracle that I got it back and was able to watch it at all.

So I made an event out of it. I picked up my best pal, Karl Burton. We went to our local movie theater and picked up a couple of large popcorns, loaded them up with butter, and went back to my place to watch the video.

My 80-inch TV made it look like we were there, right in the room with them. I fast-forwarded through the first couple of hours. People raced in and out of the break room like bees buzzing a ripe flower. And then… there she was… Samantha. I should’ve known it was her.

She looked like someone sneaking around playing hide-and-seek or maybe stealing the milk money at school, looking over her shoulders, peeking around corners, etc. And then… she did it. She took the bait.

Almost immediately, Tammy came walking in behind her.

Sam was standing there, holding my tray of brownies.

They were just laughing it up when Billy walked in.

That smart-ass almost ruined the whole thing. He starts scolding them, saying he’s going to rat them out to Sue. They hadn’t even taken a single bite yet.

Then, Henry — gotta give Henry some credit here. Henry shows up and saves the day. He walks into the room, sees what they’re bickering about, sets his cigarette down on the edge of an ashtray, grabs a brownie, and shoves the whole thing into his mouth.

Sue comes strolling in right behind Henry. She laughs, grabs a handful, says, “What Robert doesn’t know won’t hurt him,” and shoves it into her mouth. She smears it around with her palm, stuffing it all up in there.

They’re all laughing and digging in. Gorging up my brownies.

Karl is looking at me. “So, what’s the gag? Laxatives? Ipecac? What? What is it? Robert, what did you do?”

“Just keep watching, Karl. You’ll see.”

Sam’s face crunches up. Her eyes bulge. She reaches up, sticks a couple fingers into her mouth, and pulls out a long strand of something stringy.

Around the room, the faces of the others look spooked, like they’ve just stumbled onto a dead body, a ghost, or something. They’ve stopped chewing, and their faces are drooping.

Billy pulls a long strand out from between his lips and mumbles with a mouthful, “What da hell is dis?”

Henry’s eyes bulge even bigger than his stuffed mouth. “Dats fwy papa.”

Tammy reaches into the bottom of the tray, digs under the remaining crumbs, and pulls out a Polaroid. She chokes and sputters, holding it up for all to see.

Karl is looking at me. “Robert, what’s in the picture?”

I just hold up a finger. “Ssshhh. Just keep watching.”

Sue turns her head and throws up all over the side of Sam’s face.

Sam throws up on Tammy.

Billy throws up on Henry.

Henry punches Billy.

Tammy starts stumbling around, choking and flailing. They’re all panicking.

I pull another Polaroid from my pocket and toss it on the coffee table in front of Karl.

“What am I looking at here, Robert? What is that?”

“Flypaper. The sticky stuff. I hung it up out in the pig barn. And it’s covered, riddled with all sorts of bugs.”

His face is pale green and sweaty. “You put… that… in the brownies?”

“Yeah… Once I had enough. Once they were covered with all those creepy crawly things. I blended ’em up and mixed ‘em in.”

“Bug Brownies?”

“Yeppers… Bug Brownies.”

“Aw… You can shut it off now. I’m good. I don’t need to see any more. I… I don’t wanna throw up.”

“Just give it another second.”

Looking back at the TV, we watch Tammy flop back-first onto the table, choking and grabbing at her throat.

Karl leans closer to me and whispers, “What’s happening to her? Why is she choking like that?”

“Look, it was an accident. How was I supposed to know that she was allergic to peanut butter?”

“You put peanut butter in the brownies?”

“No… No, I didn’t. That’s the thing. See, I knew that could be risky. So I intentionally did not put peanut butter in there. Ya never know who’s allergic. Actually, I’m pretty proud of myself for being so considerate in that way. You know, thinking of others and all?”

Karl is just staring at me.

I continue. “Interestingly, it was the bugs: crickets, locusts, fruit flies, mealworms, etc. Tropomyosin.”

“Tropo… what-osin?”

“Tropomyosin… It’s this protein that can be found in some bugs. It can have the same effects as peanut butter or shellfish on people with allergies.”

We look back at the TV.

Sammy and Sue are trying to help Tammy.

Henry’s ashtray slips off the table. His cigarette lands on the floor. It rolls across the linoleum and settles against a loose rag.

Billy and Henry stumble around, fighting, kicking, and punching each other. They stumble into the lockers near the door, which proceed to fall, spilling old uniforms on top of the burning rag.

One locker gets jammed, wedged, and pinched in between the lockers at its top and bottom, completely blocking the doorway, their only exit.

Billy falls on top of it, further pinning it in place.

Now they’re all panicking, running around, trying to unwedge the locker. Flames crawl up the wall and swim across the ceiling. The waterspouts spurt out a blip of water, kind of like someone gleeking. A couple of bubbles and sputters, and then the spouts shut off with a bang and a creaking moan.

“So how did you get the camera back?”

“Keep watching.”

The smoke is thick, but we can still see things falling from the ceiling and walls. The room pops and aches in the smoldering heat.

“Watch this. Apparently the wall behind the lockers fell backwards into the storage room. Some of the lockers fell backwards as well.”

The camera angle tips backwards, looking up at the ceiling. My locker slams the ground. The door flings open. The camera flips up into the air and falls down into the open locker. The door slams shut.

Darkness.

Their screams trail off as distant sirens can be heard.

“The fireman didn’t want me around, but I was able to sneak in. I got lucky. It was just a whimsical thought, a lucky guess that I even looked inside my locker. And there it was… a little melty around the edges, but the card still works… Crazy, huh?”

“Crazy.”

“Pretty good home movie, though, huh, Karl!”

Karl shrugs, “Well, huh, yeah. So, that’s one way to go.” Smiles. “I guess they shouldn’t’ve been rude to Robert.”",1,1770250298.0,HorrorSuspenseTerror,0,1.0,False

The city was a carcass.

And everyone left was picking at it.

Detective Eli Mercer moved through the Bowery like a ghost with a badge, boots crunching over broken glass and teeth. Someone’s teeth. The rain slicked the pavement into a mirror of oil and blood, neon bleeding down the walls like open veins.

They’d found the girl in a trash heap behind a closed-down slaughterhouse. No shoes. No eyes. Her face looked like it had been taught a lesson by a brick. The flies had already claimed her mouth. They buzzed loud enough to sound like prayer.

Mercer stared too long this time.

The flies turned into helicopters.

The trash heap turned into a ditch full of men with their throats opened for the sake of silence.

The rain turned into napalm falling slow, beautiful, wrong.

He blinked and New York came back.

The coroner said something. Mercer didn’t hear it. His hands were shaking like a junkie’s. He pressed them together until the tremor turned into pain. Pain he could understand.

They called the killer The Choirboy. He liked children who ran with crews. Carved them up quiet. Left them posed like saints. Took pieces. Kept them. The walls of his hideouts were said to be decorated with parts that used to belong to people.

Mercer volunteered to hunt him.

Nobody argued. They didn’t want to look at Mercer when he was like this.

The building was rotting from the inside. Rats the size of housecats scattered as Mercer pushed through the door. The hallway smelled like wet fur and old death. He heard humming upstairs. A child’s tune. Off-key. Slow.

Each step up felt like walking into his own grave.

Third floor. The door was painted with blood symbols. Still tacky. Fresh. The lock hung broken like a pulled tooth.

Inside, the walls were skinned with photographs. Kids. Before and after. Smiling. Then not. There were jars on a table. Tongues. Fingers. Things that had learned to feel and now would never feel anything again.

Mercer gagged. The room swam.

He saw a boy in jungle fatigues instead of the mirror. The boy had Mercer’s face and someone else’s blood on his hands. The boy was smiling.

The Choirboy stepped out of the bathroom, knife wet, eyes shining with wet joy.

“You’re too late,” he whispered, like it was a lullaby.

Mercer shot him in the leg.

The man fell screaming. Mercer walked up and stomped on the shattered bone until it sounded like breaking kindling. The screaming turned into animal noise. Mercer didn’t stop. He couldn’t. The room dissolved into jungle again. The Choirboy’s face became a different face. One that begged in a language Mercer never learned.

“Stop,” the man croaked.

Mercer pressed the gun into his mouth.

The Choirboy bit the barrel like it was communion.

Mercer pulled the trigger.

The head didn’t just disappear. It opened. Red mist painted the walls, mixed with old blood and old prayers. Bits of bone rained down like ugly snow. One eye slid across the floor and stopped against Mercer’s boot, staring up at him like it had a question.

Silence came back wrong. Heavy. Rotten.

Mercer stood in it, breathing through his teeth, heart trying to tear out of his ribs. His reflection stared at him from a cracked mirror—blood on his face, eyes too calm, mouth a thin line of relief and something worse.

He laughed.

The sound scared him.

II.

Mercer didn’t leave the building.

The rain whispered through the broken windows, but inside the room the air was thick and sour, like something had died and decided to stay. Blood crept across the floor in slow red veins, slipping between cracked tiles, finding every low place to settle. The city always found the low places. So did Mercer.

He stood over what was left of the Choirboy and waited for the world to make sense again.

It didn’t.

The walls began to breathe.

In.

Out.

In.

The photos of the dead kids blinked. Their mouths opened and closed like fish pulled from black water. Their eyes tracked Mercer as he turned in a slow circle. Every face wore the same look—disappointment. Not fear. Not anger. Just that quiet, tired look soldiers get when you realize the war isn’t ending today.

Mercer pressed his hands to his ears. “Shut up,” he whispered. “I did what I was supposed to.”

The jars rattled on the table. Fingers tapped the glass from the inside. Tongues pressed against the lids like they wanted to taste the air again.

He smelled smoke.

Not city smoke.

Jungle smoke.

The thick, sweet rot of burned villages.

The floor peeled away into mud. The room stretched into trees. Vines crawled down the walls and tightened around his wrists. The broken mirror filled with firelight, and the man staring back at him wore fatigues soaked dark at the seams.

“You keep pretending you’re different,” the soldier in the mirror said.

Mercer’s lips moved without sound.

“You keep pretending the badge cleans you.”

The dead man on the floor twitched.

Mercer raised the gun again, screaming at himself to stop, to stop, to stop—

The trigger clicked. Empty.

The twitching turned into crawling. The Choirboy’s body dragged itself across the floor, leaving wet streaks behind. His face—half gone, half smiling—opened its mouth.

“Same animal,” it said. “Different uniform.”

Mercer backed into the wall and slid down, boots slipping in blood. He laughed and cried at the same time. The sounds tangled together until neither meant anything. His hands clawed at his face like he could rip the war out from behind his eyes.

“I tried,” he sobbed. “I tried to be good.”

The photos peeled themselves off the walls and fell around him like snow. The faces hit the floor and shattered into pieces of other faces. He saw the girl from the trash heap. The boy from the alley. Men in huts. Men with hands raised. Men who didn’t get to finish raising them.

Every time he blinked, he was pulling the trigger again.

Every time he breathed, the room filled with smoke.

He smashed the mirror with his fist.

Glass tore his skin open. Blood joined blood. For a second, he felt clean. Pain was honest. Pain didn’t lie.

Mercer pressed his forehead to the wall and started whispering apologies to names he couldn’t remember anymore. He begged the dead to stop looking at him. He begged the city to stop needing him. He begged the war to finally finish killing him.

Sirens wailed somewhere far away. Or close. Distance had stopped working.

The floor rocked like a helicopter. The ceiling peeled back into black sky. Rain fell upward. The dead stood around him in a quiet circle, patient, waiting for him to choose which side he was on.

Mercer curled in on himself, rocking, gun dangling useless in his hand.

“I don’t know how to stop,” he said to no one.

The dead didn’t answer.

They never do.

III.

The room was too bright.

One naked bulb hummed above the metal table, washing everything in sick white. The walls were the color of old teeth. Mercer sat with his hands cuffed in front of him, knuckles split open, dried blood cracking when he flexed. Someone had tried to clean him. They’d failed. The stains just spread thinner.

Two men stood across from him.

Internal Affairs. Clean shoes. Clean eyes. They smelled like coffee and distance.

“Detective Mercer,” one of them said. “Do you understand why you’re here?”

Mercer stared at the table. The metal reflected his face in warped pieces. Every angle showed a different version of him. None looked alive.

“Because I didn’t die,” he said.

The other man cleared his throat. “You were found at the scene in an altered state. You discharged your weapon multiple times after the suspect was neutralized. Witnesses say you were… talking to yourself.”

Mercer smiled. It felt like tearing paper. “They talk back.”

Silence stretched. The bulb buzzed louder. The room smelled faintly of bleach and old sweat. Mercer’s pulse thumped in his ears like distant artillery.

“Do you remember what you said?” the first man asked.

Mercer closed his eyes. The room flickered. For a second, the table was a crate of ammo. The walls were canvas, stained with rain and smoke. The men across from him wore jungle rot on their uniforms.

“I said I was sorry,” Mercer whispered. “But I didn’t say it to you.”

The second man slid a folder across the table. Photos spilled out. The Choirboy’s room. The jars. The body. What was left of the face.

Mercer looked at the pictures without flinching. He felt proud of that. The pride scared him more than the pictures.

“You executed him,” the first man said. “That’s what this looks like.”

Mercer’s jaw tightened. “He executed kids. I just finished the sentence.”

The room went quiet again. The bulb flickered. Mercer’s reflection in the photos looked like someone else’s hands had done the work.

“Do you feel remorse?” the second man asked.

Mercer laughed once. A dry bark of a sound. “I feel tired.”

They exchanged a look. The kind men share when they’re deciding what to call a problem so it can fit into paperwork.

“Have you ever sought help for what you experienced in Vietnam?” the first man asked.

The word help hit Mercer like a slap.

He leaned forward, chains rattling. “You ever watch a kid burn and try to keep screaming quiet so nobody else dies? You ever smell meat that used to be your friends? You ever pull a trigger so many times it stops feeling like your hand?”

Neither man answered.

Mercer sank back in the chair. “That war didn’t end,” he said. “You just changed the wallpaper.”

The bulb hummed. Somewhere down the hall, someone screamed. The sound threaded through Mercer’s skull and tied itself to old sounds.

The first man sighed. “We’re recommending mandatory psych eval. Temporary suspension pending review.”

Mercer nodded. He’d expected worse. He’d hoped for worse.

As they stood to leave, Mercer finally looked up at them. His eyes were flat. Empty in a way that made people step back without knowing why.

“You’re gonna put me back out there,” he said. “Because the city likes what I do. You just don’t like looking at it.”

The door opened. Light from the hallway cut across the room like a blade.

One of the men paused. “Get some rest, Detective.”

Mercer watched them go.

When the door shut, the room filled with the quiet again. The bulb buzzed. The walls breathed. For a moment, Mercer swore he heard helicopters far away, chopping up the dark.

He bowed his head to the metal table.

“I’m still here,” he whispered.

The dead didn’t answer

IV.

They let Mercer go.

Internal said he was “cleared.” The word sounded like a joke told by men who never cleaned anything themselves. The city needed him back on the street. The city always needed blood with a badge on it.

Mercer walked out of the precinct into a night that smelled like wet garbage and old smoke. The rain had stopped, but the streets still glistened, black mirrors showing him a version of himself he didn’t recognize. He hadn’t slept. Every blink showed fire. Every sound cracked like gunshots in his skull.

He took his service revolver from the desk sergeant and felt the weight of it settle into his palm like it was coming home.

The calls crackled over the radio.

Armed robbery.

Domestic.

Stabbing in Hell’s Kitchen.

Mercer turned the radio off.

He walked.

Past porno theaters bleeding neon.

Past drunks arguing with shadows.

Past kids with eyes already old.

He found the alley without knowing why. The same one where they’d found the first bodies. The walls were still stained dark. The city never really washed anything away—it just spread it thinner.

Mercer stepped into the mouth of the alley and raised his gun.

He fired into the air.

The sound cracked the night open. Windows lit up. Someone screamed. Feet ran. Radios barked to life in distant squad cars.

Mercer’s heart finally slowed. Not calm—clear.

He pressed the barrel under his chin.

Saw the jungle again.

Heard the helicopters.

Smelled the burning huts.

He lowered the gun.

“Coward,” he told himself. The word felt true.

Sirens grew louder. Blue and red light spilled into the alley, turning the walls into bleeding veins. Shadows of cops stretched long and warped across the brick.

“Police! Drop the weapon!”

Mercer turned toward them with the gun in his hand.

For one soft, broken second, he imagined throwing it down. Imagined going back inside, letting them lock him somewhere quiet where the war couldn’t find him.

Then he saw the faces of the dead in the squad car windows.

He raised the revolver.

The first shot tore into his shoulder. The impact spun him sideways, slammed him into the wall. The pain was white-hot, clean, bright. More shots followed—thunder in the alley, muzzle flashes strobing the dark like a cheap nightmare.

Mercer laughed as he slid down the brick. The laugh turned into a wet cough. His blood ran down the wall and mixed with the old stains. He felt the ground rise to meet him.

As the noise faded, he looked up at the cops standing over him. Their faces were pale. Young. Some of them shaking.

“Don’t make my mistake,” Mercer whispered. The words came out red.

Then the jungle finally went quiet.

The city swallowed the sound of his last breath and kept breathing its dirty breath, same as always.

Tomorrow, someone else would walk these streets with a badge and a gun and a head full of ghosts.

1qw5jcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1qw5jcq/ldl_1597_to_828_with_diet/,LDL 159.7 to 82.8 with diet!,"I (50f) got my labs done in August and was worried about my results, especially since I don’t know how long they had been this high. I wanted to see what I could do with diet before jumping straight to statins. 

Six months later, I got my labs done again and this time asked the doctor to include ApoB. Next time I’ll add Lp(a), I didn’t think of that at the time. 

LDL cholesterol:
August = 159.7 mg/dL
February = 82.8 mg/dL

ApoB:
August = ?
February = 0.70 g/L

Triglycerides:
August = 142.6 mg/dL
February = 76.2 mg/dL

HDL Cholesterol:
August = 44.47 mg/dL
February = 37.9 mg/dL 

Triglycerides/HDL ratio (my calculations):
August = 3.21
February = 2.01

(A1c was 5.2 in August and fasting blood sugar was 4.5. In February. Average resting heart rate and blood pressure were already good but both lowered as well, to about 57 bpm and 102/68; the cardiologist I spoke to was very happy with that.)

Along with the diet changes and accompanying weight loss (about 35 pounds), I did also start exercising more including more strength training and interval training so I’m not sure why my HDL went down even more, although I’m not too concerned about that. 

Diet changes were about what anyone would expect. Mostly vegan whole foods. Oats or plain Cheerios with soy milk, no dairy except some 0% fat Greek yogurt, lots of legumes, tofu/tempeh, whole grains, very little meat (chicken breast about once a week), salmon about once a month, lots of vegetables and fruit, nuts, very little processed food or sugar. Snacks were things like dried flavoured edamame/beans. No  coconut milk or oil. I replaced milk with unsweetened soy milk. I used a bit of canola and olive oil but not much. I added whey or vegan protein powder to my yogurt or oatmeal once in a while. I drank water, green tea, and coffee with cardamom in the grounds with a splash of soy milk and cinnamon. A small can of v-8 juice most days. 

I tried psyllium husk but even starting with one teaspoon was difficult to digest so I didn’t continue after a couple weeks. I also did alla powder for a bit, but just got tired of it, really. 

I didn’t track things much after the first few weeks but I probably got less than 2-5 grams of saturated fat most days, if that. 

I ate out about once a week for brunch, a vegetable omelette (2-3 ?) with home fries and toast. 

As I said I’m worried about how long my lipids were high and I’m going to talk to my doctor about possibly getting a scan to see what damage may have already been done. If I don’t have a high calcium score, I’m pretty happy with my numbers as they are and I think they’ll continue to improve a bit with a bit more weight loss and then stabilization). If I do need or want or need statins one day, probably in a much lower dose, that’s fine too. 

I have been inspired  by reading others’ stories of improving their lipids with diet alone, and was motivated to try this step before statins. I’m glad I did. Other than Reddit, if I tried searching how much I could reduce ldl cholesterol with diet, almost all sources would say something like 10-20%, maybe up to 30%. Mine dropped 48%. There are genetic factors involved also of course (I have some genes related to higher lipids and lower HDL cholesterol and some genes  related to normal levels) but I think it’s important for people to know what might be possible. :)

We've been Royal Caribbean loyalists for a while, but now that my daughter is grown and we'll be vacationing on our own, we're considering giving Celebrity a try. 

Right now, the choice is between Celebrity Apex and Harmony of the Seas. I've done Oasis class (though not specifically Harmony), so there aren't really any surprises there for me. I know what to expect and what I like and what I don't really use. 

For the Celebrity Apex, we're looking at a veranda room with concierge. I don't have a lot of questions there. The additional hand holding did appeal to me a bit, but I can also skip concierge. It's not a deal maker or breaker, but I'd love to hear from some of you as to what you liked and if you thought it was worth the up charge. 

Drinks/wifi... Best I could gather, the packages are similar to what Royal offers. I'm not a big drinker, but I do like the Refreshment package on Royal, which includes everything but alcohol. Using that for smoothies, mocktails, sparkling water, and coffee drinks makes it a good deal for me. I just won't drink enough alcohol to make up the difference between the two. That said, do you find as many opportunities on Celebrity to use it as you do on Royal? And is the wifi decent? Much as I love to unplug, I'll need to check in with work a little bit.

Now to the bigger things... I don't really need zip lines and climbing walls and a surfing simulator, etc. I don't need character parades. I do like the idea of a quieter, less crowded ship. We love theme parks as well, but the crowds on Royal Caribbean can be a bit much at times. We've gotten very good at finding the hidden nooks. That said, I don't know if it'd be too quiet. We're in our 40s, and we do still like fitness classes and going dancing. I know Celebrity skews older, so if you're in your 40s or younger and have done Celebrity, I'd like your thoughts on this. 

Celebrity seems like it does shine a little more in the food department. La Petit Chef sounded like a fun idea, but most of what we'll do on a first trip is explore the already included dining options. It looks like the buffet is less crowded. That's good, because I like the idea of variety, but I hate battling the crowd at Windjammer and tend to avoid it for that reason. There are four separate MDRs, looks like, but I haven't seen a menu for them yet. I'd really like more info here. 

One thing I didn't see are options for late night snackies. It's the most important meal of the day for me, but it looks like everything closes at around 1am. (Yes, I realize room service is an option.) I know that Royal has a few 24-hour options like the Promenade Cafe, but I didn't see anything similar for the Apex. My past go-to has been to hit Windjammer and put together a snacking plate for later and taking it back to my room or ordering an extra side or dessert in the MDR, and I'd imagine I can do something similar on Celebrity. I'd like some feedback on this as well. 

Finally... The points. This was the downside for me. I know that Celebrity matches status, but they don't transfer points between the two lines. I'm on a bit of a mission to get to Diamond with Royal for the perks, and Celebrity's perks are definitely not as good. But Celebrity seems like more of a fit in so many other ways... Would it be worth not adding points to my Crown & Anchor status? ",0,1770249478.0,Cruise,9,0.33,False

As a preface: I have discussed this with my therapist. The TLDR is pretty much the sum of what we have talked about. I also apologize for rambling and being somewhat sporadic with my writing, I struggle with talking about this topic coherently.

I (30M) am struggling with sexual intimacy while dating. I generally don’t have any problems with emotional vulnerability, or other forms of physical intimacy (holding hands, cuddling, being close, a gentle touch, etc).

After I have sex with someone, I’m finding that I almost completely lose the drive to have sex with them again. It’s like the game is over, and I got the “achievement unlocked” badge.

I still masturbate even when dating someone consistently, but I find that urge/sensation for release to be separate from my desire for physical intimacy and closeness.

I have also experimented with dating and being intimate with people beyond cis-female. So I’ve eliminated this as a reason.

I don’t generally go for ONS, so my first dates usually are framed as getting to know someone over a coffee, dessert, a walk, or other short-term low buy-in activity with the potential to go longer if things are feeling good. And it’s happened multiple times, where the date goes well and we hook up. I find most of the people I go out with through dating apps, and I go out with people who I’m physically attracted to. And this pattern still happens no matter how good the sex is, or how much more attracted I am to them after I see them naked. I get the urge to want to be with them sexually again usually, and continually… that is until it’s been established that we “like” each other, and there’s some sort of established safety/commitment to seeing each other again or continually… then I lose the interest like a light switch.

Also, with every single \*\*\*relationship\*\*\* I’ve been in (gotten to the stage of monogamous and bf/gf), I find that once that defined commitment is established, I NEVER initiate sex. I get that intimacy elsewhere in the relationship.

Often, when the person I’m dating initiates sex, I will comply and try and be enthusiastic until they’re finished. No matter how much enthusiasm they have for them wanting me to, I don’t generally want to. Truly it feels like sex is separate in my mind from intimacy.

TLDR: I don’t need sex to be the vehicle for physical or emotional intimacy. I find sex to be the goal of the game of dating… and once I get to the goal, I don’t want to have sex. But I still want to be close in other ways with that person.",3,1770249478.0,dating,7,0.8,False

Didn’t tell anyone where I was going or what I was doing. Just stopped responding to texts, stopped showing up online, stopped being available. For two months I was completely off the grid.

Yesterday I came back and people legitimately didn’t recognize me. Not just physically, though that changed too. They didn’t recognize who I’d become.

I’m 25. Six months ago I was the person who responded to every text within 30 seconds, was always available to hang out (even when I didn’t want to), said yes to everything, showed up to every event even when I was exhausted. I was so present in everyone else’s life that I had no space for my own.

My calendar was always full but I was always empty. I’d hang out with friends 4 or 5 nights a week, spend weekends at parties or bars, be in three different group chats actively responding all day. From the outside I looked social and successful and like I had my shit together.

Inside I was falling apart. I had no hobbies because I had no time. I had no goals because I was too busy showing up for everyone else. I hadn’t read a book in over a year. Hadn’t worked out consistently in months. Hadn’t spent a single evening alone just thinking or resting.

I was exhausted all the time but couldn’t say no to people. The thought of disappointing someone or not being available made me anxious. So I just kept saying yes and kept showing up and kept having nothing left for myself.

My actual life, the internal one, was completely neglected. I was maintaining relationships and a social presence while my own growth and development had stopped completely.

# The breaking point: 

Two months ago I was at a friend’s birthday party. One of those situations where I didn’t really want to go but felt obligated. Spent three hours there making conversation, being present, playing the role.

Drove home at midnight completely drained. Sat in my car outside my apartment and just felt this overwhelming emptiness. I’d just spent three hours with people and somehow felt more alone than if I’d stayed home.

I realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d done something just for myself. The last time I’d spent a Friday night working on something I cared about instead of being social. The last time I’d said no to plans because I needed space.

**I was living everyone else’s life and had completely abandoned my own.**

That night I made a decision. I was going to disappear. Completely. No explanation, no gradual withdrawal, just gone. Give myself two months to figure out who I actually was without the constant noise of other people’s needs and expectations.

# Planning the disappearance:

I spent the next few days researching how to actually do this. Turns out a lot of people try to disconnect and fail because their phone is right there, the temptation is too strong, willpower breaks down.

Found this app called Reload on Twitter while scrolling through self improvement posts. People were talking about how it creates structured 60 day plans and more importantly, it can block apps and remove access to things on your phone.

The key feature that sold me was that Reload could block the App Store itself. Meaning I could delete every app except the essentials, then use Reload to block myself from reinstalling anything. Even if I got weak and wanted to download Instagram or respond to texts, I physically couldn’t.

Downloaded it and spent a day setting everything up. Built a 60 day plan through the app focused on fitness, reading, learning skills, all the things I’d been neglecting. Then used it to block access to the App Store, social media sites, everything.

# What I actually did:

Sent one message to my close friends and family. “Taking some time alone. I’m fine. I’ll be back in two months. Please don’t worry.”

Then I deleted every app from my phone except calls, texts, maps, banking, and **Reload**. Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, group chat apps, everything gone.

Locked in on Reload and it blocked the App Store so I couldn’t reinstall anything even in moments of weakness. Also blocked all social media sites in browsers. The app became my enforcer when my willpower would fail.

Told my job I was using my vacation days and going off grid. They weren’t happy but I didn’t care.

The only app I kept that connected to anything was **Reload** because it had my entire 60 day plan structured. Wake up times, workout schedules, reading goals, skill development. Without that structure I knew I’d just sit around lost. I needed something telling me what to do with all the time I was taking back.

For 60 days I was unreachable except for emergency emails I’d check weekly. Otherwise I was gone.

# Week 1: Panic and guilt

The first week I felt like I was doing something wrong. I kept reaching for apps that weren’t there anymore. Would try to open Instagram out of habit and remember I’d deleted it. Would try to reinstall it and Reload would block me.

Day 3 I genuinely tried to bypass it. Tried to delete Reload so I could access the App Store again. Couldn’t figure out how they’d locked it down. That forced restriction saved me from myself.

The guilt was intense. I felt selfish. Felt like I was letting people down. Had to keep reminding myself that taking two months for myself after years of being available for everyone else wasn’t selfish, it was necessary.

Day 4 I almost gave up completely. The anxiety of being unreachable was overwhelming. What if someone needed me? What if people were mad? What if I was missing something important?

I didn’t give up. Opened Reload and looked at the plan for the day. Wake at 8am, work out 30 minutes, read 20 minutes, learn something new for 45 minutes. Simple instructions. I just followed them instead of sitting with the panic.

By day 7 the panic started fading. Started accepting that the world would keep turning without me being constantly available.

# Week 2-3: The silence was deafening.

Week two was strange. Without texts to respond to, group chats to keep up with, plans to coordinate, I had so much empty space. My days felt huge.

At first I didn’t know what to do with myself. That’s where having the structured plan in Reload saved me. It told me exactly what to do each day. Week two goals increased to waking at 7:30am, working out 35 minutes 4 times, reading 30 minutes daily, learning for an hour.

I just followed the instructions. Didn’t have to think or decide or motivate myself. Just wake up, check the plan, do what it said.

Started filling the time beyond the plan too. Went to coffee shops alone. Cooked elaborate meals. Walked around my neighborhood for hours with no destination.

Week three the silence stopped feeling uncomfortable and started feeling peaceful. I’d spend entire evenings just reading or cooking or working on the skill I was learning (3D modeling, something I’d wanted to do for over a year).

The plan increased again. 7am wake up, 45 minute workouts 5 times weekly, 40 minutes of reading, 90 minutes of skill development. My entire routine was structured around growth instead of social obligations.

# Week 4-6: Finding myself again.

This period was when things really shifted. I wasn’t just avoiding people anymore, I was actively building something.

The routine from Reload had become natural. Woke up at 6:30am without an alarm. Worked out every single day. Read for at least an hour every night. Spent 2 hours daily on 3D modeling and actually made real progress.

Started journaling on my own, outside the plan. Just writing whatever came to mind. Realized how many thoughts I’d been suppressing or ignoring because I was always focused outward on other people.

Realized I didn’t actually enjoy half the social situations I’d been showing up to. Was doing them out of obligation or fear of missing out, not genuine desire.

Realized most of my friendships were surface level. We’d hang out and talk about nothing and I’d leave feeling empty. There were like 3 people I actually deeply connected with. The rest was just social maintenance.

Most importantly, I remembered what I actually cared about. Creating things. Learning. Having time to think. Being alone without it feeling like loneliness.

# Week 7-8: Becoming someone new.

The last two weeks I wasn’t the same person who disappeared. I’d changed fundamentally.

I was in the best shape I’d been in since high school. The plan had me working out 6 days a week by this point and I’d lost 15 pounds without trying. Just from having an actual routine and following it.

I’d read 8 books. Learned enough 3D modeling to create things I was proud of. Started writing, just for myself, and found I actually enjoyed it.

I knew what I wanted. Wanted deep friendships with a few people, not shallow connections with many. Wanted to spend my time creating and learning, not just consuming and being social. Wanted space to think and grow.

I felt calm. For the first time in years I felt genuinely calm. No anxiety about unanswered texts or missing plans or letting people down. Just peace.

# Coming back (day 61)

Yesterday was day 61. The plan in Reload was complete. I unblocked the App Store, reinstalled a few apps I actually needed.

Turned my phone back to normal. **847 unread texts.** **23 missed calls.** Dozens of Instagram DMs after I reinstalled it.

Scrolled through some of it. Most was people asking where I was in the first week, then giving up. Some friends were worried. Some were annoyed. Most just moved on with their lives, which was the point.

I responded to the 3 people I actually wanted to reconnect with. Suggested we get dinner and actually talk, not just hang out in a group.

Met up with my closest friend today. First thing she said when she saw me: **“Holy shit, you look completely different.”**

I’d lost weight, sure. But she said it was more than that. Said I seemed calmer, more present, more like myself than I’d been in years. Said the old me always seemed stressed and like I was performing. This version seemed real.

We talked for three hours. Actually talked, deep conversation about real things. Told her about the two months, what I learned, who I’d become. She said she was jealous. Said she felt the same way I did, constantly available for everyone, no time for herself.

# What actually changed.

I have boundaries now. I don’t respond to texts immediately. I say no to plans when I don’t want to go. I prioritize my own time and goals over being constantly available.

I kept the routine. Still waking up early, still working out, still reading, still creating. The structure I built over 60 days is now just my life.

I only maintain friendships that actually matter. The 3 people I deeply connect with. Everyone else, I’m friendly when I see them but I’m not putting energy into maintaining those relationships anymore.

I create things now. I’m learning and building and making progress on projects that matter to me. I have hobbies again.

I’m comfortable being alone. Actually prefer it most of the time. Solitude isn’t loneliness anymore, it’s space to exist as myself.

Most importantly, I know who I am now. Not who people expect me to be or who I think I should be. Who I actually am when all the external noise is removed.

# What I learned

Being constantly available for everyone means you’re never available for yourself. You can’t grow when all your energy goes outward.

Most friendships are maintenance, not connection. You don’t need 20 friends. You need 2 or 3 people who actually see you.

Disappearing isn’t selfish. Staying in a pattern that’s destroying you because you’re afraid of disappointing others is what’s actually harmful.

You need external enforcement. I would’ve reinstalled Instagram day 3 if Reload hadn’t blocked the App Store. Willpower fails, structure doesn’t.

You need a plan for what to do with the time. Just deleting apps leaves you empty and lost. Having structured goals gives you direction.

Two months is enough time to completely change if you actually commit. Not change surface level things, change who you fundamentally are.

If you’re exhausted from being everyone’s person

You’re allowed to disappear. You’re allowed to take time for yourself without explaining or justifying it to anyone.

Delete every app except absolute essentials. Use something like Reload to block yourself from reinstalling them. You will try to break in moments of weakness, make it impossible.

Build a structured plan before you start. Don’t just create emptiness, create direction. Tell yourself what to do each day so you’re not just sitting there lost.

Give yourself a specific timeframe. 60 days minimum. Your brain needs time to detox from constant availability.

Accept that some people will be upset. That’s okay. Your growth matters more than their temporary discomfort with your absence.

The guilt will fade. The first week feels selfish. By week three you’ll realize it was necessary.

# Final thought

Two months ago I was drowning in other people’s lives and had completely lost my own. I was available for everyone and had nothing left for myself.

Today I’m someone I actually recognize. I have boundaries. I have goals. I have space to grow. I have peace.

Everyone thought I was being dramatic when I disappeared. Now they see who I became in that silence and they get it.

You don’t need permission to ghost everyone and focus on yourself. You need commitment and a system that enforces it when you’re weak.

60 days. Delete everything. Block yourself from going back. Follow a plan. Disappear. Find yourself again.

The person you become in that silence will be unrecognizable. In the best way possible.

Most women know about hot flashes and night sweats. But there are actually over 80 documented menopause symptoms that most women (and doctors) don't even realize are menopause related.

Things like:

* Burning mouth sensation (feels like you burned your tongue on hot coffee)
* Electric shock sensations (like a rubber band snapping inside your body)
* Tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in your ears)
* Formication (itchy, crawly skin that feels like bugs)
* Digestive issues (bloating, gas, changes in bowel movements)

And that's just five of them.

When you don't know these are hormonal, your brain fills in the gaps—and it rarely fills them kindly. You start Googling late at night, assuming the worst, spiraling into scary possibilities.

In this episode, I break down why education matters so much during menopause. Not because information fixes everything overnight, but because understanding what's happening lowers fear. And when fear goes down, your nervous system settles. Sleep becomes possible. Symptoms feel more manageable.

If you've been questioning your sanity or feeling dismissed by healthcare providers, this episode validates what you've been experiencing and gives you practical steps to take.",1,1770249156.0,u_TafiqsPhysiques,0,1.0,False

1qw59ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1qw59ch/the_lighthouse_of_purport/,The Lighthouse of Purport,"I stand on the edge of oblivion, the waves crashing against the rocky shore below. The tips of my toes cresting the lip of the tower. I feel its warm light behind me run rhythmically across my back. I do not know how I got here. A choice lies before me but indecision has made anchors of my feet. I look out toward the horizon and see the first rays of dawn spilling over the waves. Its creeping light climbs the white walls below me slowly bathing them in a golden hue. When it reaches my feet a new fear surges in me. My legs are crystalizing, hardening into columns of salt. As the light climbs my body more and more of me turns to the point where even if I wanted to, I can no longer move. Just as it reaches my neck, I am jolted awake. 

My heart pounds as if it wishes to break free from me. A bead of sweat runs from my forehead down the side of my brow as I sit up. Breeze blows in through the window and suddenly I am aware of the dampness of my whole body. The grey curtains swaying softly as I sit for a moment and catch my breath. The cool morning air calms my lungs and a wave of relief washes through me. It was only a dream. A light flashes in the corner of the room and I turn to look. The sky outside is still a dark shade of purple. I quickly find the origin of the light on a peninsula sheltering the bay. The lighthouse of Purport. The white tower from my dream. Sitting there for a moment I look out over the bay, scanning for some point over the black horizon. Shivering as a chill grows up my spine. I suppose it is time I woke up anyway, it's best to get an early start. Brushing off the covers I stand and walk to the closet. Some boots, canvas pants, white shirt, an old brown jacket and a grey cap, my usual attire. There is something comforting in never questioning what to wear. 

As I make my way into the hall I can hear some of my neighbors stirring to life. I live in the second story of a local restaurant in Purport where they offer some cheap accommodations. It's not much, just a single room with a place to hang your clothes, but it's home. My landlord Owen also doubles as the cook downstairs and I often stop in to grab a bite to eat on my way out. Making my way down the steps I can hear the rattling of dishes and the quiet murmurings of early morning guests still waking up. Pulling up a stool I sit down at the counter overlooking the griddle that is currently frying up pancakes, eggs and sausage. My landlord Owen flips up a pancake and we lock eyes. “Good morning Fred!” he says in his usual cheerful way. “Morning” I reply. There must have been something in the way I said it because immediately he asks, “Rough night?” I give him a half hearted smile, “Something like that.” He lifts a pot of coffee and pours some into an old mug. “Here.” He says sliding it over to me. “On the house.” Steam rises and the scent fills me with warmth. “Thank you.” “Don’t mention it. Wouldn't want people thinking there's something wrong with my beds!” He gives me a grin and throws two pancakes onto a plate with the eggs and sausage and places it in front of me. “I haven't ordered yet.” “No need.” He says, “Or would you have rather told me all the things you weren't going to order?” I smile, he's right, no point in ordering something new when you already know what you like. Digging in, I am only halfway through my meal when the thought hits me. I've done this before. But of course I have, it's my routine. This moment could be interchanged with a thousand. But at the thought the food in my mouth turns to ash and swallowing takes more effort than it ever has before. I throw some money up on the counter and thank him again, leaving my meal half finished.

Stepping out into the street I take a long deep breath of the morning air. There is dew still glistening on the street lamps and a light fog that clings like a cool blanket. I am greeted with the usual bustle of people preparing their shops for the day and the sound of hooves trotting down the cobblestone streets. The part of Purport in which I live rests on a hill overlooking the bay. As I take in the view, one carriage in particular catches my eye. A young married couple are riding by with their three children, all dressed in beautiful vibrant colors. The father says something to the kids and they laugh. I find a smile growing across my face at the joy from the family, yet a pit grows in my stomach. It feels as if something has been quietly carved out of me. They continue on their way and my smile seems to vanish as quickly as it appeared. Shaking it off I turn to take my usual route down to the market.

As I walk my eyes hover over the cobblestone a few paces ahead and my mind drifts to the dream. A glint of light shines briefly in a shop window to my right. Turning I see the reflection of that distant white tower, its light creeping through an alley on the other side of the street. Losing track of what is in front of me, I crash into a woman unpacking her things from a carriage on the corner. Suitcases fall, spilling their contents into the street. “So sorry!” I say bending over to collect her things. Clothes and other personal items litter the ground around us. “It's ok, these things happen.” A familiar voice says with slight exasperation. I lift my eyes to see her face. She is a young woman with curly red hair spilling out from a black hat with two green feathers that almost perfectly match her eyes. “Victoria?” I ask. She seems puzzled to be recognized and meets my gaze. “Fredrick!” she exclaims. She and I went to school together as kids. Those memories feel like they belong to a different life. We both stand and she pulls me in for a lingering hug. “I thought you'd have left by now.” She says a little perplexed. “I thought so too.” I know she meant no harm by the comment, but it is as if something in me has been crushed. “My, you haven't changed a day.” She says while stepping back to take a look at me. I suppose in my usual getup I look the same as I ever have. “It certainly feels like it.” I say lightheartily. “What about you?” I thought you left to see the world or something?” “Oh, I did.” Her eyes fall to her shoes. Something seems to weigh heavy on her mind. “And now you’re back?” I ask. “I guess so.” She says with little certainty. I feel a bit taken aback by this, I always felt she was destined for better things than Purport. Like she could make it out there. “Why, if you don't mind my asking?” “I don’t know, I suppose I had nowhere else to go.” My line of questioning seems to be making her a little uneasy as she begins to fidget nervously with her purse. I help her finish putting her things away and apologize once more. “Will I see you around?” She asks. “Most likely.” I reply as we say our goodbyes and part ways. ‘*I always am.’* I think to myself.

The market feels unusually quiet as I wander in. A few stalls are still waiting for their tenders to arrive but the one I am looking for is open. Walking up to the counter I see an old grey fisherman mending a net. “Mornin Fred” he says, never taking his eyes off his work. “Mornin Finn.” I say in reply. I remember as a kid running through the market and stopping to hear Finn’s grand fishing stories. Always about some great sea beast or about 'the one that got away.' He has always been here. “Going out in the boat today?” he asks, finally looking up to meet me. “I think so, was going to grab some provisions for the trip. Might make a day or two of it.” “Not a bad idea, I always felt the sea was a good place to clear your mind. Get away from it all for a while.” His eyes move from mine to some distant point over the bay. For a moment he holds his gaze there, as if caught in some distant memory. “You know I almost left once.” A light seems to glimmer in his eyes, shining as if for a moment he was a young man again. Finn has always lived in Purport, and as far as I knew it's where he wanted to be. A tension like a vise grows around my chest. *Has Finn ever had that dream?* “What stopped you?” I ask. “I don’t know…” he answers after a pause, his eyes never moving from the horizon. “I guess I didn’t know where I would go.” At this last comment his eyes break away and he returns to his work as if a man stumbling out of a dream. Silence sits between us as I ponder his words. “If you did, do you think you would have?” His eyes raise to meet my gaze and wrinkles form from a smile on his face. He bends down picking up a couple small boxes and sets them down on the counter. “Here, for your trip.” I begin to dig into my pockets for money when he stops me. “Don’t worry about it Fredrick.” Looking into his eyes I see that same glimmer again, “Just catch something out there for me wouldya.”

The sun has risen high in the sky when I finally make it down to the docks. It is nearly mid-day. The water gently slaps against the shore as I prepare for my journey. The day is calm and quiet. A better day could not be asked for. I set sail out of the harbor passing the Lighthouse as I cross off the point of the peninsula. Time has beaten its youth away but its light is still as reliable as the day it was built. Cracks line its white walls like wrinkles on a well worn smile. I know the rhythm of the light by heart. Always guiding me away from the dangers of the rocks and into the safety of Purports harbor. Something in me has always felt that no matter how far from shore I wandered it would always be there to call me home. I am sailing for no real point in particular, just somewhere on the edge of the horizon. A quiet escape into a dream.

By the time that I feel I am reasonably far enough away the day has grown old and the sun has started its descent over the deep blue waters. I start my routine, jigging some lines and setting them in their places. I drift aimlessly for a while, getting a few bites here but nothing in the boat. That dream slowly floods back into my mind. Why did I feel so helpless? What was it that I wanted? Thoughts of Victoria enter my mind. She was smart and ambitious, always dreaming of having a life somewhere else. Of being something more than some small town girl. If anyone could do it, it was her. Why did she come back? And what about Finn? He could have left, but instead he stayed. Why? Just because he never had somewhere to go? Time has slipped away from me and night has fallen bringing with it a world of lights. The black water still like glass reflects the stars as if it were a mirror for the heavens. Sitting in my boat feels as if I am adrift in a world of endless possibilities. As if a million paths lie before me.

A faint light flickers on some distant point across the water. I know that one well. The lighthouse of Purport. Instinctively I find myself turning towards the light. Towards its safety and comfort. Toward home. A chill grows up my spine. “I guess I had nowhere else to go.” Victoria’s words echo in my mind.

1qw592d,https://www.reddit.com/r/tiktokgossip/comments/1qw592d/chloebluffcakes/,Chloebluffcakes,"Hi so I used to work for chloebluffcakes back when they first opened. Very short time. And I had not the best experience ( thought I was the only one) which I thought was odd because everyone seems to love her. Until I saw a video of her saying 3 other employees tried to blackmail her. Not saying they’re right but I feel a lil less crazy for feeling screwed over by them. Sooo when I first started working there I had another part time job. They knew this. Still hired me and agreed to work around my schedule. Well… I had promised hours and kept trying to email and call and wouldn’t hear back. I would finally get ahold of her husband ( he ran everything there) and got scheduled for my first day finally. First red flag was waiting a week to hear back only to get scheduled one day for not even 2 hours :/. So when my shift does start. I get thrown into the front. No training. No run through of anything. Keep in mind I had told them I don’t have much experience at all with making coffees besides a a couple weeks at my other job. And they had a manual espresso machine (other job was automatic) iykyk. Totally lost. So first shift was kinda shit. I thought whatever they just opened maybe this is just a bad timing thing. Chloe walks in and it’s my first time meeting her. And she was just kinda complaining about the whole situation of having to meet fans that come to the store and wasn’t acting at all how she does on camera. Whatever bosses complain. It’s normal. So I end my first shift. And another week goes by of me trying to get into contact with her husband. Or anyone to help me get my schedule. No response. Until I get a email finally one week later with no hours from them till then. I come in again and since the parking lot is small I was told to park in the back. But no one was answering when I tried calling on which door to park infront of in the back since it’s hard to see. There’s no numbers and manyyyy doors. And I don’t just want to walk into a random businesses kitchen. So I just park in the front. Chloe is in the front when I enter so I ask her. Just kinda just tell me she’ll tell me later then walks off. Which okay. Second day off to a great start. Luckily the staff she hired was super nice so this sweet girl helped me figure out everything on my second day 🫶🏻. A young lady walks in and says shes there for an interview. Chloe’s husband isn’t here and Niether is Chloe. Co worker calls and Chloe completely forgot about the interview (Chloe was also late to mine and her husband ended up just showing up and I had to wait a while) well an hour pasts by before the poor girl leaves and looks crushed. Anywho. As you guessed it since Chloe or her husband wasn’t there I couldn’t get my schedule again. And emailing or calling was a joke. I waited another week and got scheduled one day again. At this point the last thing Chloe’s husband had said was it would be better to schedule me if I left my other job and came there full time. Which at first I was super excited, I loved baking, it’s a lot closer to me, and better pay. But I doubted trusting them but my parents pushed me so I didn’t have to drive so far out. So I put in my two weeks. Even though I shouldn’t have because I had an amazing job already and it was stable.  My job ends up just letting me go when I handed in my two weeks notice. I don’t blame them. Lesson learned. On the way to my third day scheduled in a whole three weeks. I notice I got removed from the work groupchat. I’m extremely nervous because it’s my only job now and I needed it. Nerves got the best of me and I just emailed that I quit. Which suprise surprise they were planning on letting me go anyways. So after promising me hours if I left my other job, they were going to fire me. Now this was years ago so I’m very much fine now and it’s whatever. I wanted to share my experience when it happened but I’ve heard she’s not scared to get legal so. And obviously I had no job so I can’t afford that. I saw her complaining on the local news however about losing  so much money due to this snow storm and it kinda tipped me over the edge. She makes so much damn money it’s not funny. She lives in a very expensive part of the city. Gated community, its own playground, huge house. She has a lot of brand deals and a ton of tik tok views. So just off of tik tok alone she makes bank. Plus her bakery… seeing her complaining on national news about losing money that’s not even going to really affect her made me pissed. 🤷🏼‍♀️there’s so many businesses that are closing here because they can’t even afford bills or groceries!! Yet she’s always throwing herself a pity party. The few interactions i had with her or been around her, she was always complaining about how her life is so hard ( which i get but other people have issues. Not just you ) and she hates when people want to see her, she only ever talked about herself basically. That’s the end of my rant, just stop giving people so much money on tik tok.

I have had typical endo symptoms for years: extremely heavy periods to the point of passing out, full body pain, pain during exams, etc. I have had cysts on my left ovary and bilateral follicles since I was about 15 or 16. 

The thing that really gets me, though, is the chest pain and trouble breathing I get right before and during my period. This has only been occurring for the past year or two. I went to a GP at my college who referred me to a cardiologist and had a heart monitor for a couple weeks when I was having palpitations and irregular heartbeats. He said I just have double heartbeats (?) and I should lay off coffee and energy drinks (I don't drink coffee or energy drinks at all). Then he said it was probably anxiety.

At first they were random, but after this I really started to notice the chest pain especially occurs before/during my period like I had mentioned. They have been even worse the past few months. It is painful for my chest to expand when I breathe, and I get this constant straining sensation even when I'm sitting or lying down. After day 4 or 5 of my period, they're gone until my late literal phase. 

Is this common with endometriosis? Should I try my GP at my college again or wait until I graduate and go to my regular GP? It just gets worse and it's seriously affecting my attendance and life in general. ",1,1770248813.0,endometriosis,2,1.0,False

We translate this as **Istanbulian**.

And we believe anyone can become one.

We are a small group of local friends who grew up in this city and learned how it really works beyond tourist streets and highlight lists.

**Istanbulian exists to teach you how to become a real İstanbullu.**

If it’s your first time in Istanbul (or you’re planning a visit), this will save you time, money, and a lot of confusion.

We didn’t learn this from blogs or guidebooks. We learned it by living it, hosting travelers, answering thousands of questions, and watching what actually works in real life.

Every week, we see where visitors struggle. Every week, we turn those lessons into clarity.

That real-world experience comes from building [**Fourside of Istanbul**](http://foursideofistanbul.com) , where we meet people from all over the world show them the real side of Istanbul on a vintage sidecar motorcycle.

Our office is located inside a neighborhood building, tucked within a cozy coffee shop ([**Coffee No.4 in Sultanahmet**](https://www.coffeeno4.com)) where locals and travelers cross paths every day.

We hear the same questions daily. We see the same mistakes daily. And we learn what actually makes Istanbul easier to enjoy.

**Istanbulian** simply turns those everyday experiences into shared knowledge.

If you’re visiting soon, this space is for you.

I figured I'd share what I settled on here for future reddit searchers cause it took me some trial and error.

It's nothing revolutionary but it's basically a bloom and 2 pours utilizing Lance Hedrick's bloom technique (longer blooms for when you want higher extraction) and April's 50/50 circular/center pour technique. What really sold me was [this](https://youtu.be/PRZ-lD5si0M?t=413) video detailing that a 50/50 circular/center pour yielded similar TDS as the 100% circular pour, yet the taste was vastly improved and more balanced. I haven't really needed the full 2 minute bloom that Lance does and usually hover between 45 sec and 1 min. So anyway here it is:

Timemore B75

15g coffee/ 250 ml (I'll use 14g or 16g of coffee to change ratio rather than more/less water)

Medium grind size (4.5-5.5 on my ZP6)

87-95c water temp depending on coffee

1. 50g bloom wait 45 sec - 2 min

2. 100g pour (50g circular 50g center)

3. 100g pour (50g circular 50g center)

4. small swirl/shake to settle coffee for drawdown (mostly cause I'm a bit OCD and like a clean filter and flat coffee bed at the end ha)

with a 45 sec bloom TBT is usually in the low 2 mins, you can slow it down a bit by swirling after both pours (again similar to what Lance does) or grinding finer

This is getting me really consistently great cups once I get grind size and water temp dialed in, and I'm finally getting a lot of the tasting notes from the bags which was always hit or miss when I'd use a V60.

Like, some people just have it and the rest of us are destined to be awkward. Then I started digging into research, books, podcasts, everything I could find. Turns out charisma isn't magic, it's a skill. And once you understand the psychology behind it, you can literally rewire how people experience you.

This isn't about faking it or becoming someone you're not. It's about understanding what makes humans drawn to certain people and using that knowledge intentionally. I pulled together the best resources that actually changed how I show up in the world, from dating to work to random conversations at coffee shops.

**The foundation: presence beats performance**

Most people think charisma is about being loud or entertaining. Wrong. Charisma is about making others feel seen. The research is clear on this, when someone feels like you're fully present with them, their brain lights up. It's literally neurological.

Start with this: in conversations, practice the 3 second pause. When someone finishes talking, count to three before responding. It feels weird at first but it signals you're actually processing what they said instead of waiting for your turn to talk. This tiny shift makes people feel heard in a way that's rare as hell these days.

[""The Charisma Myth""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11910905-the-charisma-myth) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down the neuroscience behind this perfectly. Cabane worked with executives at Stanford and basically proved that charisma can be taught. The book won multiple awards and she's coached everyone from Fortune 500 CEOs to military leaders. This is the best charisma book I've ever read, hands down. She explains how charisma is actually three elements: presence, power, and warmth. Most people only focus on power (confidence) and forget the other two. The exercises in here are insanely practical, like how to adjust your body language to signal warmth or how to use visualization before important conversations. This book will make you question everything you think you know about social dynamics.

**Body language is 80% of the game**

Your words matter way less than you think. Studies show that 55% of communication is body language, 38% is tone, and only 7% is actual words. Wild, right?

Key moves that work: keep your torso facing people when you talk to them (even if your feet are pointed elsewhere), use hand gestures below shoulder level (above looks aggressive), and mirror the other person's energy subtly. If they're leaning in, you lean in. If they're relaxed, you relax. It's called limbic synchrony and it builds instant rapport.

""What Every BODY is Saying"" by Joe Navarro is your bible here. Navarro was an FBI counterintelligence officer for 25 years and he knows how to read people like a damn book. The way he explains nonverbal communication is next level, stuff like how authentic smiles engage your eye muscles differently than fake ones, or how to spot discomfort in someone's feet before their face shows it. Insanely good read. The practical tips alone are worth it, like how to position yourself in group settings to naturally become the focal point or how to use ""gravity defying gestures"" to signal confidence. Best body language book you'll find.

For a free resource, check out Charisma on Command on YouTube. Charlie Houpert breaks down charisma patterns in celebrities and public figures. His video on ""How to Command Respect Without Being Aggressive"" is brilliant. He uses real examples and shows exactly what micro behaviors create that magnetic effect.

**The listening hack nobody talks about**

Here's something that completely shifted my interactions: ask follow up questions that show you remembered details. Like, if someone mentions they're stressed about a presentation next week, remember it. Next time you see them, ask how it went. People are absolutely floored when you do this because nobody pays attention anymore.

""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss taught me this. Voss was the FBI's lead hostage negotiator, literally talked terrorists down for a living. The techniques in here are designed for high stakes situations but they work everywhere. He introduces this concept called ""tactical empathy"" which is basically using empathy as a strategic tool. Sounds manipulative but it's actually about genuinely understanding what drives people. The mirroring technique alone is worth the read, where you repeat the last 3 words someone said as a question. It keeps them talking and makes them feel understood. This book made me realize how much charisma is about emotional intelligence.

**Storytelling is your secret weapon**

Charismatic people tell stories, not facts. Your brain releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone) when you hear a story. Facts just sit there.

Practice this: turn your experiences into 60 second stories with a beginning, middle, and punchline. Even boring stuff. Like instead of ""traffic sucked today,"" try ""I was stuck behind this guy going 40 in a 65, jamming out to what I swear was the Frozen soundtrack, zero awareness. Made me late but honestly, respect the commitment.""

The Art of Charm podcast has incredible episodes on storytelling and social dynamics. The episode with Vanessa Van Edwards on ""How to Hack Your Charisma"" is mandatory listening. She runs a human behavior lab and has data on what specific behaviors make people likable. Super tactical stuff.

If you want a more structured way to work on this stuff without reading a ton of books, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers that pulls from communication books, psychology research, and expert talks to create custom audio lessons. You can tell it something specific like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" and it'll build you a learning plan that adjusts to your progress.

What's useful is you can switch between a quick 10-minute summary when you're busy or go deep with a 40-minute session packed with examples and strategies. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, conversational style that makes even dense psychology material easy to listen to during commutes. It also has a virtual coach you can ask follow-up questions to mid-lesson, which helps when concepts click and you want to go deeper right away.

**Energy management is everything**

You can't be charismatic if you're drained. Real talk. Your energy is contagious, people pick up on it immediately. If you're burnt out, no technique will save you.

I started using the [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) app to track my mental state and build better habits around sleep, exercise, and stress. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game but it actually works. Keeping your baseline energy high makes everything else easier.

**The reality check**

Building charisma takes time and you're gonna feel awkward practicing these things. That's normal. The science shows it takes about 66 days on average to form a new habit, so give yourself that runway. Track what works, drop what doesn't, and remember that even small improvements compound.

I have found that I can waste 30-40 minutes easily dealing with one of these bullshit emails.

1qw507d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw507d,Finally doing this trend...,"Dress style - I don't have a particular style but I tend to like darker colors, sweaters in general, and I usually wear a black overcoat like pictured when it's cold.

Purpose - If only I myself knew. I feel things deeply though, and I find a sort of purpose in feeling all of others' pain in that way, if nobody else will. I do not know if that makes sense. But ultimately, at the end of the day, what I desire most in the world is peace.

Anime - I don't really watch anime, or much TV at all, it's just not my thing.

Study - I study psychology. It's a means to an end for me, I suppose, I want to fight back against the war on empathy by understanding the mind and understanding why people do so many terrible things. It is personal.

Sport - I don't know if I have a favorite sport, I don't really enjoy watching or playing sports.

Book - I put Camus the Myth of Sisyphus, because I find a lot of Camus' ideas very similar to my own. But it was a hard choice.

Zodiac - I don't believe in astrology, but for what it's worth I'm a Virgo. I was born 11 September. According to some that makes me a Leo, but I read through that and determined I'd much rather be a graceful, winged maiden with a wheat sheaf than be a lion.

Season - Winter, it brings me great comfort. Especially when it is dark outside.

Food - I'm not picky

Game - Five Nights at Freddy's, though I love the series more for the lore and worldbuilding than the gameplay. If I had to pick my favorite it would be Security Breach or FNAF 2. But I like all of them.

Place - You can find me in every lonely, liminal space.

Hobby - I have a lot of thoughts and a lot of feelings. Usually I document them in writing.

MBTI - It would kind of ruin it if I told you, no?

Song - Hard pick, but I said Lana Del Rey's cover of Blue Velvet as of recently. But I also have loved Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade of Pale for nigh-on my entire life.

Cartoon - It's been aged since I've watched cartoons aside from tolerable late-night hotel room family guy. I grew up with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic though, so probably that.

Manhwa - Had to search this. I don't have one.

Drink - I'll have a black iced coffee, if you don't mind.

Color - Depends on the day and how I am feeling. But the common denominator is black.

Animal - Swans... invasive, but nonetheless beautiful. Or perhaps doves.

Eye color - Bluish grey or greyish blue, depends how the light hits them.

Car - That one in the picture is a Facel-Vega. But any dark-colored vintage car is perfect. In addition I am quite fond of Cadillacs. I would also definitely drive a hearse if I had one.

TV show - Do Nick Crowley's youtube videos count? I often find myself listening to ""the darkest \[x\],"" true crime, and other content that documents the darker things in life. I think it is to understand and to develop empathy, if distressing. When you have heard of the first-hand accounts of all the terrible things you are far less likely to bring them around raucously. You realize their weight, you cannot divorce yourself emotionally.

Plant - I love weeping willow trees, but they are uncommon where I live. They are so... graceful. Yes, that's how I'd put it.

Career - I am a college student. I have a job, but not one I'd want to make a career. I am hopeful that I can someday go into graduate and later post-graduate research in psychology.

Hair - Long-ish, straight, golden brown if it's washed but it grows darker within a few hours. I can't find a great photo. Imagine a Gardevoir but with brown hair.

Interested to see what people think. I could see this going several ways. Bonus points if you guess my enneagram too.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qw4ihs)",1,1770248485.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

Before starting meds, I would eat sugary refined carbs and drink sugar coffee every few hours (was a proud coffee addict, also had a shopping addiction), and I was pretty good at getting a lot of protein in by buying and eating the same protein enriched things. It’s easy to get protein in when that’s your entire motivation for getting through the day. I guess I was already a bit of a picky eater before but I had a good amount of safe foods. 

Now I don’t want coffee OR sugar and I’m not constantly looking forward to my next meal or treat. Issue is I don’t want anything at all and the textures of stuff is grossing me out, plus the tastes aren’t doing anything at all for me. I don’t feel hunger cues until it comes on 0-100 nauseous pain and then I really don’t want anything. It’s been less than a week so I want to keep giving it a go, plus the meds I think are helping in retrospect although I don’t feel differently on them except for the food. Does it get better?

\*“The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet.”\*
\*— Carl Sagan\*

\*\*1977. Earth.\*\*
\*\*California, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\*\*

Under the fluorescent hum of the laboratory lights, the golden disc gleamed with a cold luster. Its surface was as smooth as a mirror, but a close inspection revealed microscopic imperfections along the edges—traces of the manufacturing process.

A young engineer, hands clad in white gloves, lifted the disc with reverence.

“Doctor, be honest with me,” the engineer asked, his voice low. “Do you really think anyone will be able to interpret this?”

A brief silence filled the room. Carl Sagan did not answer immediately. Instead, he looked out the window. The bright lights of the facility washed out the night sky, hiding the stars from view.

“Interpretation…” Sagan smiled bitterly as he finally spoke. “That represents a hope—a wish that they understand it the way we intend.”

He gestured with his chin toward the disc in the engineer's hands.

“We are simply putting a letter in a bottle and casting it into the cosmic ocean. Whether the finder reads it as a love letter or a declaration of war… that is entirely up to them.”

A thin copper disk plated in gold.
Diagrams depicting playback instructions.
The hyperfine transition period of hydrogen.
And the coordinate location of Earth relative to pulsars.

Ann Druyan flipped through her checklist, murmuring to herself. “Music, the sound of waves, rain… and greetings in fifty-five languages. Nothing is missing.”

She paused, her pen hovering over the paper. “But language is a strange thing. Nuances change in just a hundred years.”

A colleague standing nearby retorted bluntly. “Is a hundred years the problem? If thrown out without context, it could be misunderstood as early as tomorrow.”

“But this is different, isn’t it?” The young engineer pointed to a section of the chart on the wall. “The physics and math. The hydrogen atom structure, binary code. These are universal languages. There is no room for misunderstanding.”

Sagan nodded slowly, lifting his coffee cup.

“True. Math doesn’t lie.”

He took a sip, then looked at the engineer with an unreadable expression.

“The problem is, it’s too honest. The formulas themselves are ‘universal,’ but they don’t explain ‘why’ we sent them.”

“Pardon?”

“Is it a simple greeting? A display of vanity? Or perhaps… preliminary intelligence sharing for an invasion?”

Sagan’s gaze lingered on the pulsar map etched onto the cover.

“Depending on the eyes that see it, the interpretations could be infinite.”

There were no further objections.

\*\*Weeks later.\*\*

Voyager 1 stood bound to the launchpad, venting steam like the ragged breath of a beast. The golden record was firmly secured to the side of the probe, sealed within its protective case.

“There is no coming back now,” someone whispered, watching the monitors in the control room. “It’s a one-way ticket.”

“Long after we are all dead and gone,” another researcher added, “that thing will keep flying, won’t it?”

Sagan stared at the countdown clock.

“That is why it is a record,” he whispered softly. “Though whether it will be a blessing or a curse, we cannot know.”

\*“10… 9… 8…”\*

With the countdown, the engines roared, vomiting crimson fire.

\*“3… 2… 1… Ignition confirmed. Liftoff.”\*

A heavy vibration shuddered through the floor, reaching the chairs of the control room. The rocket carrying Voyager 1 tore through the atmosphere and soared upward. A journey toward the eternal darkness beyond the solar system had begun.

And so, the symbols humanity believed to be most universal and peaceful departed for the cosmos.

Unaware that they would one day become the seeds of a catastrophe.

I’m mainly looking for friendship and people to hang out with occasionally — whether that’s grabbing coffee, walking around malls, trying new food spots, or just vibing and chatting. Want to keep it on Reddit unless we vibe then we can swap socials.

~`Pretty easygoing and friendly
~ Creative/artsy and love cozy hobbies
~ Enjoy casual outings, low-pressure hangouts, and good conversation
~ 420 friendly 

More into small groups or one-on-one than big party scenes. Just hoping to find someone (or a small group) to build a relaxed, supportive friendship with while I settle into a new area. I'd like to meet in public first few times, can host girlies (can't have guys over with my lease but if you're cool we can make something work for sure!)

Every time the question ‘What’s the worst pain you’ve ever had’ gets posted on Askreddit (which is about 3 times a week), the top answers always include kidney stones. It seems like it truly is terrible and I’m trying to avoid them at all costs!

I’ve always been a big water drinker, but I do love a soda water and coke zero. I’ll never have energy drink but do love me about 4 shots of coffee a day.

I also exercise a few times a week but is there anything else I can do to make sure this particular pain is something I’ll never have to experience?

I met my partner through Hinge a few months ago, but due to them being unwell we didn't actually meet in real life until two weeks ago, and we had a great first date. We went to the cinema, then a coffee shop, and ended it in their bedroom (not as in sex, literally looking at cool things they'd collected) then they asked to kiss me and I said yes, but oh my god it genuinely made me so uncomfortable. I went home and cried for almost three hours because I felt so dirty. They didn't do anything wrong, they were kind and polite and held me nicely, but I felt genuinely soiled by the fact I'd kissed them. I had to wash every part of myself and scrub at it with an exfoliant in order to feel clean again. (My first time kissing anyone aside from my biological family or cat) (who is of course my biological son but aside from that.)

We went on our second date today, I went to their flat to watch some TV. They brought me flowers. They kissed me again. I felt this niggling guilt in my stomach that I didn't feel like I was in love. When we talk online I feel like I can tell my soul to them, but in person I just- don't. We cuddled for almost five hours and I spent most of the time either missing my cat, or thinking about how I felt guilty for not appreciating them being there. I don't know what's wrong with me, I liked the feeling of their hands on my skin for about 20 minutes, but then it just stopped and suddenly I just felt like an animal being passed around a petting zoo instead of a person.

And they're disabled. I knew they were from quite early on. I knew they used a cane to walk, and struggled with long distances, but it seemed much worse than I anticipated today. I feel guilty saying it, but they were talking about how they've basically become bedbound due to their disability, and it made me feel so heavy that I just wanted to leave. I don't want them to be going through this, but I don't want to go through it as their partner either. I can't stand the idea of a relationship where we can't go on dates because I'm afraid of hurting them by pushing them too far. They're a beautiful writer, but they don't see a future for themselves, and I feel awful about it, but I don't blame them. They're just getting sicker and it's harder for them to do anything that they used to enjoy/be good at. It makes me feel selfish, but I feel like seeing them in real life is like seeing a ghost of the person they used to be, even if I never knew them back then, and I prefer talking over text, etc, because I don't have to imagine them in pain on the other side of the screen.

Is something wrong with me? Shouldn't I be giddy and excited to spend every moment with them by now? I feel guilty for not loving them exactly as they are, but I know they're miserable as they are, and I don't want to fall in love with someone who's miserable. I don't mean to be selfish, but I feel like I am, because they're so lovely and I want to fall in love with them but it's just not working for me right now.",1,1770247818.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

I'm a long time Nespresso club member and have multiple machines (office, home).  My original machines have been going strong for over 10 plus years, cant fault them whatsoever.

When I moved to my new office i purchased the Vertuo Creatista as I love my coffees long.  After 6 months (1 day coffee drinker), i noticed the coffee was burnt and bitter- totally undrinkable.  After sometime and services the machine was replaced the issue wasn't fixed.  Now I am 4 months in my new machine and its starting to burn my coffee. Now, I have tried multiple Cleans, descales, factory resets, etc etc, thought what I have noticed with both machines is that the motor becomes extremely hot, even hours after use.

Has anyone else experienced this? Since the machine is under warranty i'm looking to get a full refund, and will most probably switching over to the original pods.",1,1770247624.0,nespresso,0,0.67,False

This is the planned itinerary:

Fri, 6 Feb: Arrive at LIR from Toronto at 4.30 pm. Proceed to hotel at Coco beach in rental car. Hopefully spend an hour at the beach/pool 

Sat, 7 Feb:  Checkout the beach, breakfast, leave for La Fortuna by 12 noon. Checkin at our Airbnb (jungle lodge in Sonafluca). Kept the rest of the day free to unwind and explore the property.

Sun, 8 Feb: Relax in the morning. Coffee and Chocolate tour in the afternoon. Then choose between night sloth/frog walk and free hot pools (El Choyin?) 

Mon, 9 Feb: Mistico Hanging bridges in the morning. Paid kid friendly hot springs in the eveninig

Tue, 10 Feb: Hoping to squeeze a sloth tour/beekeeping tour in the morning. Return to Coco with lunch stop at Cabinas Piuri to take a dip in Rio Celeste. Checkin to hotel at Coco

Wed, 11 Feb: Relax at hotel with late checkout, then head to airport. Our flight is at 4.30 pm.

  
My questions are:

1. Is this itinerary doable? Anything I should add/take out?

2. What hot springs should I book that is kid friendly as well as fairly affordable?

3. Any restaurants with good vegetarian options?

As always, modding my CYOAs are allowed as long as I am credited as the original creator. List of updates below.



""Greetings Future Overseers, thank you for attending this seminar presentation. Everyone have their fill of donuts and coffee? Ahem.

As the Regional Director for our operations in this part of the country, I'm here to discuss the latest developments in the fast-paced world of Vault design.""

\-We've opened up submissions for custom experiment proposals. Now you can come up with your own ideas for experimental Vaults.

\-Some Vault's will now be able to hire V.I.P.s from the top of their fields.

\-Due to limited availability, Cryo-pod bays have been moved from the Residential Arrangement section to the facilities section, and limited to 200 pods (Renamed from sectors and rooms.)

\-Improved designs from our agricultural team have allowed us to combine hydroponics and farming food source options into one broader option labeled Farms and Gardens.

\-New facility blueprints for a radio station and recording studio. We have also made a trade deal with certain countries to create a foreign consulate office, allowing our allies to preserve their cultures.

\-We have a special deal for loaning a suit of restored power armor to some of our Vaults after it will be used in the countries upcoming tricentennial celebration parades.

\-New techniques have been developed for keeping sectors of the vault hidden and secure.

**“The universe was becoming very strange, but the forms were all in order.”**

Quote from an old Form’s Clerk SGT.

 

Chen opened up a new personnel file, labelled it for CAPT Feebee Jones and logged her physical age as 19 with a real age much greater. He picked the option “Cryo Exposure” as the reason for the age anomaly.

Better choice than “Classified Augmentations”. That often flagged unwanted questions. Vanilla is good and reality often deferred to the paperwork.

 

Chen reviewed Marine Jones’s file. It had an administrative footprint larger than her visibility within the force. A happy coincidence.

 

When Chen tried to save the file, the Personnel System’s AI asked if this was a duplicate of another file. Jones was a common name. Marine Jones’ was offered as a possible dupe to CAPT Feebee Jones. Chen felt he’d done enough so left Marine Jones’s record intact. He’d always found that the safest answer was the one already written.

 

*That should do it.*

 

Chen then wrote up Marine Jones’s orders. She was to be given a remote duty assignment. He told her “It’ll look great on your personnel file and shows flexibility. A great opportunity.” She was transferred off ship within days, the paperwork covering this off got lost in the system. A Jones was already on the ship’s register, and a Jones stayed there. Her slot was accounted for and paid for.

 

In the rest area, Feebee grabbed a coffee and sat with the marines. One, a sergeant, saw the bars, read her name tag and greeted her.

“Sergent Peters reporting, ma’am. Welcome back Captain Jones.” Peters stood up and saluted. He’d seen a note alerting people to her return aboard ship. He vaguely remembered a Jones. Anyway, it didn’t matter. No one was objecting so it must be right.

The others at the table acknowledged her, some with a nod of the head, others with the traditional “Ma’am.”

 

 

When the QI hacked into the Personnel System it was to see what they had on Feebee. But the QI found that it “enjoyed” testing itself against the security systems. Had fun. It also found out that there had been two Jones’s on the ship. She saw what this opportunity presented and put what she was doing down to non-operational training.

There were some anomalies, discrepancies the software flagged.

Biometrics. Merge biometric data into filename Feebee Jones. \[**Yes** or No\]

Age. Already handled by Chen’s classification of cryo exposure.

 

The QI further amended the records, muddied the clumsy footprints left by Chen, fixed the timestamp drift where necessary and ensured Marine Jones had a clean, bright, albeit scant history. A footnote explained that she had been assigned to a covert, highly classified op. It was the sort of trail someone would leave who was busy and trying to clean up a person’s record. Not perfect but no resistance in the system, no missing access privileges.

Feebee Jones now had a career-spanning record of actions, citations and awards that were a fair representation of her training and abilities. She was returning from another off-board assignment. Her status was present but unresolved. This wasn’t a problem, almost all military systems preferred continuity over accuracy. There were not red flags, just footnotes.

Finally, the QI sealed both files to all but the most classified of eyes, and Chen.

 

Internal systems did the rest. When Feebee approached doors, they whooshed open, her name was resolved easily when she spoke it. Systems accepted her.

Chen saw Feebee being quickly accepted by the crew as Jones.

He called her to his office, for “a fire-side chat”.

 

She was shown in by Chen’s 2iC and gave him a polite nod.

“Captain Jones reporting as requested.”

“Stand easy Jones. Join me.” Chen pointed to a pair of easy chairs facing a view port. No fire. This was of great relief to Feebee, fires are dangerous in the oxygen rich atmosphere of ships.

“I just wanted to have an informal chat. It’s something I do with everyone in my command. Nothing to worry about.”

Feebee's posture remained relaxed, she wasn’t sure what there could be to worry about… other than a fire.

‘Forget the fire. It’s a saying. A fire-side chat is just an informal discussion.’

‘Ack. Now, please leave me alone.’

She waited, still. It unsettled Chen. He wasn’t used to people being so comfortable within themselves. Although they had the same rank, this nineteen year old “kid” had a way about her.

 

Chen recalled the feedback from his scientists. They’d briefed him before the fire-side chat.

The lead scientist had been like a child at Christmas. Excited, wanting to get into the present he’d been given and play with it.

 

He put her under the microscope, literally and Feebee just sat there, perfectly still as they probed and prodded. He had analysed her every which way they could, checked and cross checked her epigenetic clocks with blood-based biomarkers, metabolic signatures and other biological clocks like telomere length.

He asked the man how old she was.

The best they could come up with was a physiological age around nineteen. Chen asked the obvious question, *Based on what?*

“Best guess.” Not the most reassuring reply.

Her skin and skeletal systems were near perfect, yet she reported many injuries including wounds, breaks, torn ligaments and dislocations during training. One scientist had suggested they analyse her nanites. They took blood, there were no nanites. They took saliva, no nanites. They even took a tissue sample. Not only did the tissue repair itself within seconds but the tissue itself was also free of nanites. They concluded that her nanites didn’t survive, or couldn’t survive, outside her body; they turned instantly to… best guess, dust. But even that was wrong because they would have been able to detect dust.

 

Chen brought his focus back to CAPT Jones. She was in the same position, unmoved, unmoving. Unsettling.

 

“Do you like resting? Sitting still?” he asked.

Feebee shrugged. No response required.

“Ok. I’ve got some questions for you.”

 

The QI spoke up, ‘You need to engage with him more. Put him at ease. We may need him.’  Feebee let out a deep sigh. It surprised Chen. It was the first expression of presence she had given him since sitting down.

Feebee perked up, shifted her focus firmly on him. He felt uncomfortable. Vulnerable. He shook the feeling off. She’s nineteen.

Feebee read him, clear as day.

“Relax. Ask your questions.” Feebee was trying.

Chen got up, crossed to the side table and poured himself some water. “You?” he asked.

She nodded, “Yes, please.” Then belatedly added, “Sir.” Unsure how to address him.

“No need to call me Sir. We are of equal rank.”

“Oh. OK. Good.”

 

She watched him as he sipped the water realising it was a ploy to buy himself time. She sipped hers. Matching him sip for sip.

He noticed and noted.

“Right. Questions. How long were you on the alien ship?”

“There was no time on the ship. I don’t know?”

“How did you get on the ship?”

She had prepared for this with the QI. They’d role played the discussion as best they could. Over and over at a speed only capable directly within her brain.

“When I awoke, I had no memory of being elsewhere. I don’t know?”

 

A feed directly to Chen confirmed the truth in her statements. One buzz for truth. Two for untruth.

 

“And how long ago did you wake up?”

She rephrased an earlier answer, “Hard to know as time didn’t exist on the ship.”

BUZZ

Chen nodded sagely as if understanding.

“And it exists now? Time?”

“Yes. Your routines are locked into a cadence.” She made a play of struggling to find the words, then added, “A daily cadence. A circadian rhythm.”

Chen was getting frustrated; this was going nowhere.

“What can you tell me about the alien ship?”

“It was damaged when hit by an asteroid. This nearly broke it in half. Slowly we got the droids repaired and then they helped get the ship fixed up. More droids fixed more droids; it was a multiplier. The meteor both broke and fixed the ship. It was mined for resources.”

Chen cut across her, “But it had a small comet attached to it when we found it.”

“Yes. We needed it for water. To make oxygen.”

BUZZ.

“But where did the comet come from.”

“I don’t know. There are lots of them. They just float around.”

BUZZ.

Chen got angry with his backroom people. ‘Will you stop with the damn BUZZing. It’s driving me made.’

‘Ack.’

 

“Ok. Let’s get down to why you’re here. I want you to work for me.” He just blurted it out.

She answered immediately, “Yes, I’ll work for you. I think I already am.”

Chen frowned, not what he’d expected. 

Feebee continued, “You just haven’t asked me yet. I’ll do it but up until the work stops being about balance.”

“And then?” Chen asked.

Feebee didn’t hesitate.

“And then, I’ll start asking different questions.”

 

**Meanwhile, somewhen else…** The Long Quiet observed.

OBSERVATION: Subject Feebee Jones assigned to CAPT Chen

RISK: LOW

QUIETUS PROTOCOL: PASSIVE MONITORING.

PRIMARY EFFECT: Structured authority without coercion.

SECONDARY EFFECT: CAPT Chen exhibits tolerance for non-conventional outcomes.

 

STATUS: STABLE – OBSERVE. No further intervention required.

 

**Back now…**

Chen turns to Feebee, “Balance. Perfect. I have something for you. A simple start, to ease you in. Administrative really.”

I just got married and moved to Abbotsford from Toronto, and I’d love to meet some girls around my age 🥹 

I’m 25, love cute cafes, trying new food, and just chilling in general. I’m a little introverted, but I’m down for pretty much anything (walks, random mall trips, spontaneous coffee runs, or just hanging out tbh).

With Ramadan coming up, it would be cute to have an open, friendly girls’ group. We could go out for iftar, grab some desserts, or just plan a fun little get-together 💕.

And if anyone’s cool with couples, we can do a group hangout too!

1qw4k6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightmareOnElmStreet/comments/1qw4k6c/the_inspirations_for_freddy_krueger/,The Inspirations for Freddy Krueger,"Freddy Krueger and Nightmare on Elm Street was created by Wes Craven through a combination of things that inspired him. The first was an incident where as a child he was stalked by a homeless person who was the physical inspiration for Krueger. The name itself was taken from a childhood bully of his. And his M.O. was based on a series of LA Times articles depicting Cambodian Refugees who were traumatized by the war they escaped from that their own nightmares killed them.

‘Wes Craven said his inspiration for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the ""worst thing"" he could think of. The decision was made to instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song ""Dream Weaver"" by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, ""When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone.""

A Number of Newsletters described some strange Deaths of Hmong Boys who died while sleeping. One Boy even tried to stay awake by having a hidden Coffee Machine but he end up dying while having a Nightmare.

The Cause of Death was only descriped in the 90s by Pedro and Josep Brugada.

A genetic Heart Desease today known as Brugada Syndrome

The Look was Inspired by a drunken Homeless Guy who tried to scare Wes Craven as a Child. He was wearing a Sweater.

The Name came from a School Bully named Freddy.

The Sweater is stripped in Red and Green because these Colours are suposed to be difficult to tell apart. However this is only true for People with Red-Green Blindness.

Wes Craven once heard a story about a boy that had nightmares and told his parents about it and his parents said go to sleep and when he had the nightmare he died and also Wes Craven when was in high school he had a bully named Fred Krueger

But now i'm in a weird place where i'm aware of the value of money and aware i should save it towards goals.  Like I overthink on my purchases, I usually buy store brand items or the second cheapest brand, if I forget to make myself lunch I usually buying myself something to eat thats under $5.  The only things I really overspend regularly on is this carton of coffee creamer I really like that's $5 because it's made with better ingredients then the artificial crap and it tastes better.  The only big BIG purchase I made was a videogame console (Steamdeck) because of a one-week road trip where I wouldn't survive on music alone.   

The only things i'm very bad with gifts.   I overspend a disgusting amount on gifts for people I love.  Once I got disposable income, I thought about all the ways i could treat my family.   First it was doordashing donuts once, then it quickly became surprising my sibling with concert tickets one time to their all time favorite band they were 100% convinced they would never have a chance at going to (It was life-changing, I wouldn't change that day for the world), then christmas rolls around and I get my family nice gifts since it's the first year i managed to get them nice gifts, but then what made me start thinking was getting my sibling brand new nice headphones.  $350 bose headphones.   My sibling's previous headphones were absolute junk, one of the speakers literally hanging loose by a wire and they had them for years.   My sibling was trying to convince me to buy them new headphones off a sketchy ebay add, but if I was gonna buy them anything, I didn't wanna get scammed.  At first the headphones were on sale, and I was gonna wait till my paycheck, but by then the sale ended and then they were full price.  I got them for them anyway because they were so SO excited for them and they already agreed on cleaning my room + closet in transaction.  

Now i'm buying furniture for my new room (things like a bookshelf and an office chair) and it's like... Damn no wonder I don't have thousands of dollars in my savings like my friends.
