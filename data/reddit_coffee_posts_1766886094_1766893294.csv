Is it inappropriate to ask for his number?,"For some context I’m a supervisor at a coffee shop and we have the same delivery driver who comes in almost daily. There’s is a rule where if there are employees present in the store, the driver doesn’t have to put away the frozen items, but it is a courtesy to do so anyways. He would never put away the frozen items but one day, about a month ago, he came up to me and apologized. He said that I never did anything wrong for him to not put away the food and that I was always really nice. Ever since then we always talk when he comes in to deliver. Never flirting, but just friendly banter and asking about work.

I’ve always thought he was really cute but ever since we started talking, it has amplified my crush 😅 We also have 2 other closing supervisors and I am the only one he puts away the delivery for. He came in today and i was blushing so much while we were talking. Would it be weird if I asked him for his Instagram or number the next time he came in? Im not sure how to ask without it sounding awkward and don’t even know if it’s a good idea! Any advice would help :)

I’m looking to get into home espresso, and have started researching but am getting overwhelmed by all the different opinions. I have settled on the Breville Bambino + Baratza Encore Esp for my core equipment, so I don’t need advice there.

I was a barista at 5 different coffee shops (ranging from Starbucks to specialty) and I swear none of them took espresso as seriously as you all do 😭. I honestly just want something that will be consistent, easy(ish) to make before work, and ON THE AFFORDABLE SIDE. In the new year I would like to buy less useless things people on reddit convince me to buy😆

That being said, what are the most basic accessories I need to make good, (drinkable) iced lattes. (I genuinely don’t think I will ever use the milk frother, so no discussion about that needed)

I am putting myself out there in hopes of making genuine female friends. I live a pretty intentional, celibate lifestyle and really value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and good company.

I enjoy hanging out casually (coffee, food runs, or just talking). I’m a good listener, goal-oriented, and I love to cook (feeding people is kind of my love language 😄). I work in finance and IT, so I’m always down for thoughtful conversations or learning from others too.

I’m happy to cover dinner if we hang out. No expectations, just good vibes. I’m also open to sharing pics if that helps build comfort and trust.

If this resonates with you and you’re also looking for a sincere, drama free friendship, feel free to message me :)

No one really talks about how to be *good* in one. Most of the advice floating around on TikTok or Instagram is just performative fluff: “Be his peace,” “Cook for him,” “Don’t complain too much.” Like, ok?? But what if being a “better” girlfriend has nothing to do with any of that?

A lot of people, especially in their 20s, are realizing that relationships unravel not because of cheating or huge fights, but because of a thousand tiny emotional misfires. It’s not usually villainy, it’s skill gaps. And the good news? Relationship skills can be learned. This post is packed with insights from legit sources, books, real research, and psychology podcasts. No IG therapy quotes, no “divine feminine energy” cringe-talk.

Here are hard skills that actually make someone amazing to be in a relationship with:

* **_Stop “supporting,” start co-regulating_**  
  Forget “being supportive.” It’s vague. What actually builds connection is emotional co-regulation, which is your ability to stay steady *with* your partner when they’re upset.  
  * *Psychologist Dr. Becky Kennedy* breaks this down beautifully on her podcast. Your nervous system affects theirs. If they’re spiraling and you get anxious or dismissive, it escalates. But if you stay grounded and present, their brain mirrors that.  
  * The Gottman Institute’s research shows that couples who manage conflict well actually turn toward each other emotionally *during* hard moments. That means being calm isn't passive. It's contagious.  

* **_Don’t be “chill,” be honest_**  
  The “cool girl” trope is dead. Over-accommodating out of fear of being “too much” just builds resentment.  
  * From *Terri Cole’s book “Boundary Boss,”* constantly minimizing your wants is not generosity. It’s self-abandonment. Real intimacy depends on clarity, not guessing games.  
  * Be upfront when something bothers you. But don’t dump it like a hot potato. Use the “self-focused” script: “I feel X when Y happens, because Z.” Not “You always do this.”  

* **_Learn your real attachment pattern (then manage it)_**  
  This is the relationship cheat code. Most of us think we have “baggage” or are just “weirdly emotional” but actually, we have stored nervous system patterns from childhood that play out in relationships.  
  * *Attached* by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller is a game-changer. It breaks down anxious, avoidant, and secure attachment styles. You realize, “Ohhh this is why I freak out when he doesn’t text back for 5 hours.”  
  * Knowing yours helps you soothe it *yourself*, instead of blaming your partner. That’s emotional maturity 101.

* **_You’re not his therapist, but you do shape his growth_**  
  No, you can’t “fix him.” But you do influence him. A lot.  
  * According to a 2022 study published in *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, partner responsiveness, how well partners respond to each other’s needs, has a long-term effect on emotional development.  
  * That means how you listen, validate, or respond during his messy moments might shift how vulnerable he’s willing to be, not just with you, but with himself.  

* **_Upgrade your “arguing” software_**  
  Fights are inevitable, but *how* you argue predicts if your relationship lasts. Cold fact: eye-rolls and passive-aggression are stronger predictors of a breakup than actual disagreements.  
  * The *Gottman Institute's “Four Horsemen”* model says contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling destroy relationships faster than cheating.  
  * Replace criticism with a “soft start” (“I noticed” instead of “you never”), and always repair after conflict. That’s what resets connection. Not who “wins” the argument.

* **_Be interesting to yourself_**  
  No one wants to be someone’s entire emotional ecosystem. You being obsessed with your own growth, hobbies, or learning journey is hot.  
  * Esther Perel, therapist and author, says “desire needs space.” Want to be magnetic in your relationship? Maintain a life outside of it.  
  * Read more. Try stuff alone. Follow your curiosity. You don’t need to become a mystery. You need to stay multidimensional.  

* **_Understand partner’s “love currency,” not just yours_**  
  Everyone talks about the 5 Love Languages like it’s old news, but many girlfriends forget the *real* point: your partner doesn’t think like you.  
  * *Dr. Gary Chapman*, author of the Love Languages, emphasizes the importance of adapting, not just expressing. You might love deep convos, they might just want a hug after work. Learn to speak *their* language fluently. That’s emotional fluency.

* **_Practice “micro-kindness” instead_**  
  Romantic grand gestures are rare. What actually makes people feel loved are micro-moments: remembering something small, checking in before a stressful day, or making coffee without a word.  
  * A study from Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program in collaboration with Gallup shows small daily acts of kindness had a larger impact on relationship satisfaction than big events.  

There’s zero shame if you didn’t know any of this. Most people never got taught how to actually do partnership well. Relationships are a skill, not a vibe. And being a “better girlfriend” isn’t about being easy or agreeable, it’s about being emotionally fluent, self-aware, and co-regulated.

If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

*(c. 1800–1900)*

# Overview

In the 19th-century American West, **mind-altering substances were widely used, largely legal, and culturally normalized**. There was **no federal drug prohibition** and little medical understanding of addiction as a disease in the modern sense. Substances that are tightly regulated today were commonly sold in **general stores, saloons, pharmacies, and by mail order**.

Temperance movements existed—originating in the East and spreading westward—but **criminalization and federal enforcement did not meaningfully begin until the early 20th century**.

# Major Substances in Use

# 1. Alcohol

* **Ubiquitous and socially central**
* Consumed daily by many adults; no legal drinking age
* Safer than much available water
* Saloon culture central to frontier towns
* Heavy use widely tolerated, though moralized by temperance advocates

**Alcohol was the dominant drug of choice across class, region, and occupation.**

# 2. Tobacco

* **Everywhere, all the time**
* Hand-rolled cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and chewing tobacco
* Used by men, women, and even children
* Rarely stigmatized

# 3. Laudanum (Opium in Alcohol)

**One of the most important—and misunderstood—substances of the era**

* A tincture of **opium dissolved in alcohol**
* Legal, unregulated, and widely marketed
* Sold by:
   * Pharmacies
   * General stores
   * Traveling salesmen
* Common brand names included *Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup* and *Godfrey’s Cordial*

**Uses:**

* Pain relief
* Diarrhea and “bowel complaints”
* Menstrual pain
* Coughs and insomnia
* Infant teething (often with tragic consequences)

**Who used it:**

* Especially common among **women**, including middle-class and respectable households
* Often prescribed or recommended by doctors
* Considered “medicine,” not a vice

**Addiction awareness:**

* Dependence was recognized (called “the opium habit”)
* Withdrawal symptoms were observed, though poorly understood
* Treatment options included rest cures, sanitariums, or gradual tapering

**Important note:**  
Laudanum addiction was **far more prevalent than commonly acknowledged**, particularly because it was socially invisible and medicalized.

# 4. Opium (Non-Medicinal Use)

* Highly **culture- and region-specific**
* Most strongly associated with **Chinese immigrant communities**
* Opium dens existed primarily in:
   * Chinatowns
   * Mining towns with large Chinese populations
* Recreational opium use among white Americans was **far less common** than later moral panics suggested

# 5. Hallucinogens

* Used **primarily in Indigenous ceremonial contexts**
* Peyote and other entheogens were:
   * Sacred
   * Ritualized
   * Not recreational
* Some westward settlers encountered these substances through **cultural exchange**, but widespread non-Native use was rare

**This is why depictions like the “scientific” experimentation in** ***Young Guns*** **stand out as anachronistic or exaggerated.**

# 6. Cannabis (Marijuana)

* Present but **not widespread**
* Most common among:
   * Mexican populations
   * Some African American communities
* Rarely mentioned in mainstream Anglo-American records
* Not criminalized or strongly stigmatized in the 19th century

# 7. Cocaine

* Legal and medically used by the late 19th century
* Found in:
   * Tonics
   * Toothache drops
   * Early medicinal preparations
* Not yet associated with criminality or racialized panic

# 8. Ether

* Used medically as an anesthetic
* Occasionally abused for intoxication
* Depicted accurately (though rarely) in media such as *Open Range*
* Still legal and purchasable by the 1880s

# 9. Caffeine (Coffee and Tea)

* **Universal daily stimulant**
* Coffee especially central to frontier life
* Sugar was expensive and scarce until beet sugar production expanded later in the century
* Numerous films (*Dances with Wolves*, *Open Range*) correctly depict coffee scenes emphasizing its importance

# Legal and Cultural Context

* **No federal drug prohibition until the early 1900s**
* Local “dry” laws existed (often religious or political), but:
   * Enforcement was inconsistent
   * Economic incentives discouraged strict regulation
* Substances were not criminalized in a blanket or systematic way

# Understanding Addiction Then vs. Now

* Addiction was **recognized**, but not scientifically defined
* Terms like “habit,” “intemperance,” or “moral weakness” were used
* Treatments included:
   * Sanitariums
   * Religious reform
   * Rest cures
* Modern neuroscience and evidence-based treatments did not exist

**That said:**  
It was as obvious in 1800 or 1900 as it is today when someone was severely abusing substances.",2,1766892647.0,Westerns,0,1.0,False

1pxgwku,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1pxgwku/was_coffee_available_on_prebiotic_earth/,Was Coffee available on pre-biotic earth ?,"I asked AI to generate a plausible pre-biotic scenario for formation of coffee. Here it goes :

  
The chemical signature of coffee—specifically its primary bioactive components like **caffeine** and **chlorogenic acids**—can be synthesized through plausible prebiotic pathways relevant to early Earth conditions.

In the context of 2025 research into prebiotic chemistry and origins of life, a theoretical pathway for ""prebiotic coffee"" follows these steps:

**1. Synthesis of the Xanthine Skeleton (The Caffeine Core)**

Caffeine is a methylated xanthine. On prebiotic Earth, the xanthine skeleton could have formed in non-aqueous or concentrated environments (like drying lagoons) from simple precursors:

* **Formamide Pathways:** Neat formamide, under catalytic conditions with minerals like **calcium carbonate** (CaCO₃) or **zeolites**, can generate purines including xanthine and hypoxanthine.
* **HCN and Ammonia:** Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia, common in the early atmosphere, can polymerize to form adenine and other purine precursors through free-radical reactions. 

**2. Prebiotic Methylation (The Transition to Caffeine)**

To turn xanthine into caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), specific methyl groups must be added.

* **Methylating Agents:** Simple molecules like **methanol** or **methylamine** (formed prebiotically from formaldehyde and ammonia) could act as methyl donors.
* **Mineral Catalysis:** In the presence of reactive minerals at hydrothermal vents, these methyl groups can be transferred to the nitrogen atoms of the xanthine ring. While plants use complex enzymes (N-methyltransferases) for this, high-energy prebiotic environments can facilitate similar transmethylation reactions with high yields. 

**3. Formation of Chlorogenic Acids (The ""Coffee"" Antioxidants)**

Chlorogenic acids (CGAs), which give coffee its bitterness and health benefits, are esters of **quinic acid** and **caffeic acid**. 

* **Aromatic Building Blocks:** Aromatic rings like those in caffeic acid can form via the **shikimate-like pathway** or through the prebiotic condensation of small hydrocarbons (like acetylene) under volcanic heat.
* **Prebiotic Esterification:** In fluctuating volcanic pools, where cycles of wetting and drying occur, quinic acid and caffeic acid can undergo **spontaneous esterification** to form various isomers of chlorogenic acid. 

**4. ""Prebiotic Roasting"" (The Final Flavor Profile)**

The complex aroma of coffee comes from the **Maillard reaction** during roasting.

* **Early Earth Mimicry:** Impact events or volcanic heating can trigger Maillard-like reactions between prebiotic sugars (formed via the **formose reaction**) and simple amino acids (like glycine).
* **Melanoidin Formation:** These reactions produce high-molecular-weight molecules called **melanoidins**, which are responsible for the dark color and prebiotic potential found in modern coffee grounds. 



So how much of it could be plausible do you think? Was there a prebiotic ""Brew"" available on the early earth?

(On second thought, I should have asked it about other interesting compounds for prebiotic synthesis as well, e.g. the one Walter White would have been proud of).

Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named shadow\_surf

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a friend?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

It doesn't matter what your age is or where you're from! Feel free to reach out if you'd like a best friend! :)",1,1766892118.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1pxgthd,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1pxgthd/how_do_you_talk_more/,How do you talk more?,"I have always struggled with talking more. Like being more verbal. Usually I say one thing in response to what someone else said or asked, and then after that I’m done. I can’t keep the conversation going or think of another response. I’m in this friend group of girls I have known for 4 years and I asked if anyone wanted to grab coffee and no one responded. I’m trying not to take it too hard, but it stung. Especially since I thought they would at least want a coffee with me. But I guess I get it, I never reach out or talk much when we’re together as a group….but they’ve never reached out to me one on one to grab coffee/brunch either :/ I’ve just done group activities with them but still nobody responded to my group invite. And people always ask generally in the chat who wants to grab brunch or coffee, and people always respond but not when I did :/

Anyway, enough with the ranting. I’m just down about it. I’m trying to reflect and improve my social skills but not with them. I thought I at least deserved acknowledgement :/ we are all in our late 20s/early 30s too so I’m 31 and it’s hard to make friends now. I don’t want to give up yet, but I don’t know how to improve.

1pxgsne,https://www.reddit.com/r/EyesWideShut/comments/1pxgsne/my_take_on_eyes_wide_shut/,My take on Eyes Wide Shut,"I've been obsessed with Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut for years – its long production, the endless interpretations, and how it pulls you into speculation without ever giving clear answers. Recently, I dove deep into its historical and cultural roots, and I wanted to share some of my findings here as an intro to a longer essay I'm working on. This isn't about wild conspiracies like ""Kubrick exposed Epstein"" or ""he was killed for it"" – I reject that outright, as per the recent Vulture piece. Are wealthy elites abusing their power, including abusing children? Of course they are. We already know that. Our society has never had an effective way to hold concentrated wealth and power accountable. That reality doesn’t need *Eyes Wide Shut* to reveal it, and I don’t think Kubrick was trying to.

That being said, there are secrets hiding in plain sight in the frames of EWS.

I don’t believe *Eyes Wide Shut* is exposing secret societies. I think that framing misunderstands what the film is actually doing. *Eyes Wide Shut* **is a secret society**. 

The following is pure speculation, but hear me out. What if upon learning that his daughter Vivian joined Scientology, Stanley Kubrick did a ton of research on L Ron Hubbard, and that research into Scientology led him to recognize it as a **repackaging of much older ritual and occult traditions**—drawing from ceremonial magic, initiatory hierarchies, confession rituals, and promises of self-knowledge and integration. (Look up L Ron Hubbard and Jack Parson's Babylon Working Ritual) What struck him wasn’t just the continuity with Western esotericism, but the way these tools had been **modernized, systematized, and psychologized**, giving them extraordinary persuasive power. Kubrick’s implied conclusion, as I read it, is that the same structures that promise enlightenment and wholeness also contain the **latent threat of coercion and brainwashing**, depending on who controls the ritual and how much autonomy the initiate retains. *Eyes Wide Shut* reflects this ambivalence: ritual as a path to truth—and as a mechanism of control.

Upon meeting Tom Cruise, I speculate that Kubrick suspected that there was more to him than just the polished, hard working, super palatable and profitable movie star. As they began their intimate pre-filming discussions with Nicole Kidman, Kubrick sensed that Cruise was hiding what Aelester Crowley would call his ""True Will.""

I read *Eyes Wide Shut* as a film about **celebrity, marriage, and performance**, staged through symbolic doubles that echo the real dynamics between the stars and the director. In this lens:

* **Bill Harford** represents Tom Cruise’s *profitable, forward-facing movie-star persona* — polished, trusted, granted access everywhere but incapable of integrating desire or self-knowledge.
* **Nick Nightingale** represents the *creative process* Cruise was once deeply engaged with — a process that once required him to look inward to fuel his performances. he inner artistic labor that made transformation possible, now externalized and detached as the star image sustains itself.
* **Alice Harford** represents Nicole Kidman as a more *integrated figure* — actor, movie star, and sex symbol — consciously navigating fantasy, performance, and marriage rather than being undone by them.
* **The Mystery Woman** is the **Scarlet Woman** — (From Jack Parson's and L Ron Hubbard's Magik Ritual the Babylon Working) the spiritual office that holds uninhibited desire and truth immune to societal norms. She embodies what Bill seeks but cannot survive integrating.
* **Victor Ziegler** represents Hollywood authority and management — and possibly Kubrick himself — who presides over and controls everything we see, and who wants to exploit Tom Cruise's Scarlett Woman for his own pleasure. 
* **New York City Christmastime Jazz** The most disarming, palatable, and mainstream genre ever. The Bill Harford side of Tom Cruise can turn this on whenever he wants thanks to the hard work he was once involved in with Nick Nightingale. 
* **Elevation and Substances** the higher a character gets (either by stairs or marijuana) the more aware they are that they are in a movie. The lower they get (again stairs or booze) the less aware they are. 

Under this reading, the core tension of the film is that **Tom Cruise’s profitable star image and his true will and desires cannot coexist simultaneously**. They must be compartmentalized for the image to function. The film stages what happens when those compartments begin to collapse — and then carefully intervenes before they fully do.

Lets look at the opening of the film. Nicole Kidman undresses between two Masonic pillars and in front of a triangle. She is enlightened, baring all, and knows what movie she is in. We then see an establishing shot of their apartment on the upper left of the screen. Tom Cruise looks down at us (supporting the establishing shot), but before he can see us, we are already behind him. He is fully dressed (revealing nothing) and in the dark. He has no idea what kind of movie he is in. 

In the first half of the film we see Alice flirt with Hungarian and then make out with her husband. She is leveraging he sex appeal against her status as a married woman, playing along with the double standards we have for our leading lady celebrities. This can also be seen when she is dressing up in fancy underwear while doing her morning routine with her daughter. Her job is to be sexy and maternal. Available for us to project our fantasies on, but not too available. Thats why she's a superstar. She can sell this because she is well aware of her private desires and fantasies (the navel officer.) She knows when she's acting and who she is inside and is capable of walking that fine line. 

Tom Cruise's Bill Harford can't quite do the same dance. His interaction with the two models shows no signs of passion. That's why Zeigler calls him upstairs- the director is trying to exploit his star's real inner desires for the sake of the movie, but she's passed out. (heroin and coke, uppers and downers, meta and not meta at the same time) 

The movie is born through the director (Zeigler) observing Tom Cruise's profitable movie star image (Dr Bill) and his True Will Scarlett Woman (Mandy) locking eyes. 

The problem is that as Tom Cruise's profitable movie star image, Dr. Bill has no idea who the mystery woman is, or that there is more to life than what he can see. When Alice confronts him, he doesn't even know how to respond. 

The rest of the movie is Cruise trapped in a world built by Kubrick for him to discover and integrate his true desires. But for Bill to survive, the Mystery woman must die. Tom Cruise can either be a movie star or his authentic self, but not both. At least not in 1999.

I've really enjoyed viewing this film with this framework, and taking into account the real people and locations involved. That man who pulls Nick Nightingale away when he first meets Bill is played by Michael Doven, Tom Cruise's personal assistant and real life scientologist spy! This is Cruise trying to reconnect with his creative process, but scientology is managing them so tightly they can't get too far.  

In the orgy, Bill is left wandering downstairs while The Mystery Woman goes exploring upstairs with Leon Vitali in a Christopher Columbus mask. Then Vitali shows up again as Red Cloak, presumably newly aware of Tom Cruise's true will , and the Mystery Woman sacrifices herself for Bill to live. 

The building that Bill is teased and shoved in front of is the same building as Rainbow Fashions, and also Sharkey's Coffee Shop. The whole pinewood neighborhood set is set up as a place for Bill to explore his inner self, but when he returns later in the film, the neighborhood has been painted red and is now for Sale by...Leon Vitali! 

What do you think? I have a lot to say about every scene in this whole movie. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this theory and get into discussing some of the other scenes.

I left my home state in Florida to move to Washington so that I could live with my partner. At the time his dad was very sick and I didn’t want to separate my boyfriend from his family because his dad was basically in the process of passing away. I left behind all of my friends and family when I moved. 

My boyfriend has been showing very guilt tripping, controlling, and plain out rude behavior lately more than ever. We have had our few arguments and issues and did our best to resolve them. He would get upset and walk off from me and shut hisself into the bedroom and I’d be left to pick up the pieces by myself every single time. He likes solitude and to isolate where as I do not. At first it was okay it was great being with him but after a while I need friends to chat with or want to go shopping with a friend or go get a cup of coffee with a friend. The isolation and loneliness is depressing and upsetting to me. 


Recently we traveled back to Florida so I could see my family and friends and have Christmas with my family. From the second we got there he made comments about my house. He called it dirty, said we were raggedy people, etc. I have spent this trip walking on eggshells and being so upset with his nasty comments and ugly behavior that is quite embarrassing to me and to my family. 

Tomorrow we are going back to Washington and I hate to go back. I really honestly do not want to go back. I need to because my puppy is at a pet resort there and I can’t trust he would take care of my puppy until my mom and me get there to pack my stuff. 

So I am thinking of going back to Washington and picking up my puppy. Giving it about a week or two window of time and see if he changes for the better or if this continues and if it does continue I’ll call my mom tell her make your way here to get me and my puppy. My mom is very much willing to come and get me. I’ll wait until she’s a little over half way there and then tell my boyfriend look I’d like to go home for a while it’s nothing against you but I’d like to be surrounded by my family and the comforts of my own home for a little while. I don’t think that conversation with my boyfriend will go very well. 

I feel like it is justified to want to come back home but I just feel so guilty about it. I feel like I am a bad person or partner for wanting to come back home. Please if you have any helpful advice let me know. I am truly at a loss here and I genuinely just don’t know what to do or where to start. ",1,1766892028.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

Seems like the Breville has a few additional bells and whistles like PID and looks like no Panarello might be a plus, not to mention looks like the Delonghi has more plastic. 

My coffee goals are to be able to make something that rivals takeout coffee. Ease of cleaning would be a plus otherwise I'm not too picky.

1pxgkes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWideContent/comments/1pxgkes/customizable_mobile_food_trailer_features_that/,Customizable Mobile Food Trailer Features That Improve Daily Efficiency,"In today’s fast-paced food industry, efficiency is everything. When you’re operating a food business on wheels, every second and square inch matters. That’s why more food entrepreneurs are turning to customizable mobile food trailers that come equipped with smart, flexible features designed to make daily operations smoother and faster. Whether you're serving tacos, coffee, or gourmet meals, the right setup can make a big difference in your workflow and customer satisfaction.

One of the standout features of modern food trailers is adjustable stainless steel countertops. These aren’t just sleek—they're also incredibly easy to clean and sanitize, which is a must when you’re preparing food on the go. Their durability ensures long-lasting use, even in high-traffic environments. Foldable or extendable prep tables give operators the flexibility to adjust the space as needed, depending on the menu or the day’s foot traffic. More counter space means more room to prep, assemble, and serve without clutter, keeping operations running efficiently.

Ventilation systems are another major upgrade in today’s food trailers. Good airflow isn't just about comfort—it's about safety and efficiency. Advanced exhaust hoods and built-in fans help maintain a consistent temperature, keeping the working environment cool while reducing the risk of smoke buildup. A well-ventilated trailer ensures your equipment runs at peak performance and your staff stays energized throughout the day.

Integrated storage solutions are also changing the game. Instead of wasting time searching for ingredients or tools, everything has its place—thanks to built-in cabinets, wall hooks, and magnetic strips for knives and utensils. This means faster prep times and less stress when the lunch rush hits. Some trailers even offer pull-out compartments and dual-layer shelving to keep things organized without taking up extra space.

The **customizable mobile food trailer** also features essential components like high-capacity sinks and easy-access water tanks. These upgrades allow you to stay compliant with health regulations and maintain hygiene with minimal effort. When water systems are built directly into the trailer design, cleanup becomes faster and more effective—something your staff (and your customers) will definitely appreciate.

With thoughtfully designed layouts, user-friendly installations, and space-saving features, customizable trailers are redefining what it means to run a mobile food business. They’re not just vehicles—they’re full-fledged kitchens built for speed, safety, and success.",1,1766891371.0,TheWideContent,0,1.0,False

Or, how to thrive as a lawyer who’s a night owl?","As a late 30s applicant to law schools across Canada I have lived long enough to know I am not a morning person. If the science behind chronotypes is real then I am someone that gravitates towards starting my day later with my mental/energy levels also naturally peaking later. Any attempts I make to become a morning person are usually short-lived. It’s not caused by any health issues. Unfortunately caffeine has little effect on me as I metabolize it very quickly, if I’m feeling tired I can easily sleep right after drinking a coffee (Americano, even!).

It’s funny, I currently work at a courthouse and find I feel tired all day, but once the work day is wrapping up suddenly I get a second wind out of no where. It’s annoying, it’s as though my body and mind prank me daily. 

I feel absolutely pathetic over this and wonder how the hell am I going to handle the serious demands of being a lawyer one day if I can’t handle something as simple as getting my day going in the morning?!

The only time my body/circadian rhythm cooperates with feeling awake/alive/alert during the day and tired/asleep at night is when I go camping in a tent out in nature. I effortlessly do a complete 180 then. I also get my best sleep when I go camping. Too bad it doesn’t seem possible for a lawyer to combine their work life with camping life without getting their credibility or mental health seriously questioned should it come out that they willfully live in a tent!

Anyway, I don’t expect to ever be accommodated for being a night owl, but if I had it my way places like court would have evening shifts, starting later in the afternoon and run until 11pm, like Walmart! Feeling ashamed over this isn’t helping so instead I’d like to ask all you legal professionals here if there are any areas of law that are better suited for lawyers who are night owls? Comparatively, are there any areas of law that lawyers should avoid if they tend to be night owls? I imagine these would be practice areas that involve attending court. I know not everyone with a JD is a lawyer, so are there any careers suitable for night owls with JDs who don’t practice as lawyers? I am open to any suggestions or considerations that could help me find a niche or manage my night owl tendencies in the context of a legal career. Maybe that could mean working as a lawyer in Whitehorse where it’s total darkness for a few months out of the year. 

Surely I can’t be the first or only night owl interested in pursuing a career in law. I appreciate the opportunity to candidly share this here and look forward to your insight, but also understand if I just need to “suck it up buttercup”.

“It’s a church,” Mom said, staring at the stained glass windows of Jesus hanging on the cross. Her narrowed eyes and pursed lips told me she was clearly holding back additional commentary.

“It was a church,” I said. “Now it’s a bookstore. My bookstore.”

“What?”

“I bought it! That was the surprise!”

“I thought it’d be grandchildren. You made it seem like grandchildren, Lillian.”

“In fairness to me, I am increasing the flock.”

“Not funny.”

“Yes, it is,” I said with a smile. “I’m thinking of calling it ‘The Church of the Perpetual To-Read List’.”

“But it’s a church, darling.”

“In a previous life, yes, it was a church. Now it’s a bookstore.”

“Churches don’t have previous lives.”

“I know Christian dogma doesn’t allow reincarnation, but Jesus or his pals never mentioned that buildings can’t start over as something else.”

“I just don’t know who’d buy books from a church, is all.”

“Mom, the best selling book of all time is the Bible. I feel like you’re not understanding the basic premise here.”

“Lillian, I understand the basic premise. I just don’t understand why you picked this place to open a bookstore.”

“It was either this place or Kitty’s Whorehouse, but that place is still in business.”

“Oh, Lillian, please. In front of a house of worship,” she said, walking inside the building.

We were still moving in, so the building was half church, half bookstore, but it still received the full Mom judgment. She walked around, running her fingers over some pews and checking how dirty they were. Admittedly, they were still filthy because I was currently removing them, but the store was coming into shape. I was scheduled to open in two days, so I’d basically been living in the store to get it finished in time.

“So, I’m thinking of having new releases up front, couches where the pews are, the front desk floating in the middle, an entire section over here for romance and romantasy books, and a coffee stand with free mugs with purchase.”

“Don’t give away coffee, dear. It invites a slothful element. And what’s romantasy?”

“Books where fantasy creatures do what typically happens in the back of cars on prom night. Often in graphic detail.”

Mom crinkled her face. “And these kinds of books are popular?”

“The most popular.”

“No wonder the modern world is in the shape it is.”

“Lil, is this the last of the books?” Jason asked, taking off his well-worn Phillies cap and wiping his brow.

“This shipment, yes. But another one is due later today.”

“It never ends,” he said, shaking his head. “Jesus, this humidity is going to kill me.”

“Jason, please don’t blaspheme in the Lord’s house,” I said with a wink.

“I wasn’t blaspheming. I was appealing to a higher power.”

“Are you two quite finished with your little rat-a-tat?”

“We’ve been at this for days. I’m too tired for rats or tats,” Jason said. “What do you think of the place?”

“It has all the charm of a small-town church.”

“What we were going for,” I said, adding, “Praise be.”

“Amen,” Jason said.

“Well, your little jokes aside, I admire what you two are doing here. I’m a big fan of literacy and third places. You’re building quite a nice ‘hangout spot’ for the town, so kudos to you both.”

“Thank you, Mom,” I said. “Seriously, means a lot.”

“I knew you had it in you,” she said. “I didn’t imagine it’d take this long to find it, but better late than never.”

“There it is,” I said with a chuckle. “That’s the mom I love.”

“Did Lil tell you about the basement?” Jason said, changing gears.

“I didn’t know churches had basements,” Mom said. “Though I suppose you need a place to keep the crackers and wine for service.”

“You make it sound like they served hors d’oeuvres.”

“I think that’s where the priests used to live. Tight but cozy.”

“Noisy, too,” I said absentmindedly.

“What?” Mom asked. “How so?”

Jason looked at me, annoyed. I sighed; this was my mistake, and I was going to have to guide us out. “Well, sometimes, when you’re down there, you hear voices.”

“Voices?” Mom said, surprised.

“Voices, breathing, some knocking,” I said. “Could just be the church settling.”

“Or the good Lord making himself present,” Jason added, trying to smooth out my rough road.

“Jason, dear, if the walls are breathing, it’s not God’s work. Try the guy a little south of there,” Mom said, shaking her head. “Did you know about this when you bought the place?”

“Didn’t come up. We have since sacrificed a virgin to appease the gods, and that seems to have worked.”

“Very clever, Lil.”

“We’re making it our horror section,” Jason said. “It’s got the vibe for it. I’ve been working on dressing it up.”

“It’s his pet project,” I said. Just then, my mewing orange tiger-striped cat joined us and gave me the perfect chance to shift gears away from the breathing walls. “Speaking of, here’s Mookie Petts. He’s the grandson you were hoping for, Mom.”

“Lovely.”

“Hey boy, how’re things out in Sky’s End? Busy?”

He meowed, flopped onto his back, and rolled into my feet. I reached down and scritched his belly. He rolled back and forth for a bit before popping up, wrapping himself around my legs, and sprinting off into the church.

“Is it sanitary to have a cat roaming around?”

“Mookie is good people. Plus, he’s got a job. Keep mice and rats out.”

“It remains to be seen if he’s even capable of that,” Jason said. “So far, all I’ve seen him master is sleeping in the sunbeams from the stained glass.”

“He works at his own pace,” I said. “If you’re too hard on him, you’ll give him a complex. Then he’ll be a weird adult.”

“He might even buy a church and turn it into a bookstore,” Mom said with a nod. I laughed. She still had her fastball. “Is the basement ready to be seen?”

“Not just yet. Close though.”

“The body parts we ordered haven’t come in. It is so hard to find a reliable grave robber these days.”

“Jason, I don’t know how you put up with her.”

He hugged me around my waist. “Who doesn’t love a challenge?”

“Hey,” I said, playfully smacking him. “That and you love me.”

“That, and I love her.”

“We all do,” Mom said. “Though some days are harder than others.”

“It builds character, Mom.”

“Knock, knock,” came a sing-songy voice from the front door. We all looked over and saw Darcy, the town mayor, come sauntering inside the church. She was always this chipper, which is probably why she’d been elected six times in a row. That and nobody really wanted to be mayor. In a place as small as Sky’s End, there really wasn’t too much to do. It was the perfect job for someone who needs to stay busy with minor tasks.

“Darcy, how goes the mayoral dealings today?”

“Oh, you know, the fun never stops. Had to remind Jeff at Jeff’s Market not to feed the raccoons at night. I’m afraid he’s domesticating them.”

“I’ve seen so many of them around the church at night, I’m thinking of hiring them as security.”

Darcy sighed. “They’re not even afraid of people anymore. I went out last night to check on some noises I heard behind my shop, and I saw ten of them standing there just waiting for a handout.”

“Those things are disease-ridden,” Mom said. “Ghastly beasts.”

“They’re cute,” I said.

“No, your mother is right. They’re a blight on the city. We’ve worked long and hard to make Sky’s End a picturesque small town, and I won’t have roving gangs of raccoons ruining it.”

“Roving gangs? Is it like West Side Story? Rival raccoon gangs fighting for turf, the love of a pretty young thing, and to sing songs about their favorite dumpsters,” I said.

“You laugh, but when they’re crawling inside this place, eating your books, you’ll want them gone too,” Darcy said. “But I didn’t stop by to talk about the night bandits - not this time, at least - I came to see if you were still on track for the opening date?”

“Ugh, yeah, I think so,” I said, turning to Jason to help confirm.

“We should be good enough to open. Might still have a few odds and ends to finish, but we’re on track.”

“I hired the best contractors,” I said, slapping Jason on the butt.

“Well, that’s great to hear! The Harvest Festival is the premier event on the Sky’s End social calendar. The night walk to St. Asbeel’s Church is a storied tradition handed down from the town’s founders. It’s essential that we keep the tradition going. The town will pillory me if I screw it up. We’ve already promised our sponsors that we would be ready to go. We have to be ready to go.”

“I know it looks dusty in here, but we’re going to be okay.”

She surveyed the construction and shook her head. “Are you sure? I know you’re new to the town, so the importance of this may be lost on you, but….”

“Darcy,” I said, interrupting her nervous breakdown, “if my man says we’re on track, I believe him. We’re golden.”

She turned to Jason. “Are you sure?”

“Positive. It looks worse than it is.”

“My daughter is a lot of things, but a liar isn’t one of them. If she says it’ll be done, it’ll be done.”

“I give you permission to unclench,” I said, touching Darcy’s tensed shoulders.

She must’ve believed us, because her whole body relaxed. She smiled and gave me a small clap. “Sorry to come across as manic, but there are so many people who look forward to this event, and I just want it to be special.”

“And you’re up for re-election, right?” I joked.

She smiled. “Well, that might be a secondary reason, yes. You are a bright one.”

“At least 60 watts,” I said.

“Well, I will leave you to your, uh, cleaning? I look forward to seeing it all done,” she said. She saw the sign for the large romantasy section and squealed in delight. “Oh my! Is this area going to be all romantasy?”

“Yes, ma’am. All the fairy lovin’ fun that’s fit to print.”

She lowered her voice and smiled. “Don’t tell anyone, but that is my favorite genre! So spicy yet so fun!”

“Your secret is safe with me,” I said. “Come by when we officially open, and I’ll let you take the pick of the litter. On the house.”

“I am going to take you up on that offer, dear!” Darcy said, nearly floating out of the building.

As she left, I turned to Jason. “Did I just bribe the mayor?”

“Sounded like it, Lil.”

“I think I just became involved in a political scandal.”

“I’d call you deep throat, but your mother’s nearby,” he whispered.

“Jason, dear, can you help me bring in my things from the car? I’d like to get my room set up before nightfall, and I’d hate to be accosted by roaming raccoons,” she said, apparently not hearing his joke or choosing to ignore it.

I kissed Jason on the forehead, and the two of them left to bring Mom’s stuff into our little house across the street. I watched them go and felt a strange emotion overtake me. Happiness. It felt weird, like putting your tongue on a nine-volt battery.

With everyone gone and Mookie running around doing God knows what, I had a little time to do a walk around the church and take stock of what else I needed to do. It was in these quieter moments that I allowed myself to push aside the joy of ownership and focus on what other chores we’d had to take on.

It was always our dream to open a charming bookshop in a small town. I’ve always been an avid reader, and Jason loves a project. The church coming up for sale wasn’t on our radar, but when we found the ad online - and the low price - we had to jump. Dreams don’t wait for the perfect time to happen - they just do.

It’d been a hectic month. Pulling the rows of church benches and pews was a nightmare, but once they were gone, the true vision of the store took shape. It was quirky and unique, but I found that all the best bookstores were. My favorite from childhood was an old, converted bank. The vaults held different genres. The owners had made a tunnel of books you could walk through. Local artists took up small corner offices where accountants had once toiled and now made something beautiful for all the patrons to see.

I wanted something like that - I found it in St. Asbeel.

The walls were adorned with exquisite stained-glass windows depicting the Stations of the Cross. When the sun reached midday, the store’s floor was bathed in a kaleidoscope of color. Above us was a spire that easily made us the tallest building in Sky’s End with a bell that would chime every hour. The heartbeat of the town. The grounds had flowering bushes, soaring oaks, and a greening copper statue of St. Asbeel himself looking out over the greenery. It was a perfect spot for a picnic or to read a chapter before heading back to work.

We were lucky we found this place.

I was in the former quiet room, née coffee cafe, when I heard the bell to the front door chime. Assuming it was Jason returning, I called out, “Hey, any chance you brought me lunch?” When there wasn’t a response, I turned around to see who had come into my clearly closed store, but didn’t see anyone.

“Jason? You here?”

Nothing. I walked out into the store’s central area and looked around. I didn’t notice anyone else in there, but I felt a presence there. Another energy. Sounds woo-woo, I know, but you know the charged feeling you get when you’re around others. I had that, but apparently I was the only one.

“Mookie, if you figured out how to ring the bell, I swear to God,” I started, but stopped when I heard footsteps heading down the stairs. I knew Jason had been determined to get his horror section into shape, but it was unlike him not to let me know he had come back.

I made my way to the stairs as quietly as mice wrestling on cotton and gave a listen. I didn’t hear any footsteps anymore. Instead, I heard a voice. It wasn’t Jason’s.

It also wasn’t clear, like hearing a radio through a wall. You know someone is talking, but the language is just word-shaped gibberish. Sims speaking to each other - clear as day to them, but leaving their creator guessing what the hell they mean.

I took a hesitant step down and cocked my ears as if I were fine-tuning the radio. Fiddling with the knobs until the static cleared and I could hear a Red Hot Chili Pepper’s song I hated anyway. Another step down toward the basement. Leaning forward, bracing myself on the banister. I could almost make out what they were saying. It was something like —

BOOM!

A book on the shelf behind me fell to the floor with a crash. I gasped as if someone had been choking the life out of me and nearly tumbled down the stairs. I spun around, expecting to see a ghoul rising from the floor, ready to possess me, but instead heard the soft, friendly trill from Mookie. He lay down on the shelf and knocked off two more books.

I caught my breath, laughed, and brought my forehead against his. “You’re so lucky you’re darling because otherwise I’d boot you outside to fight off those gang-affiliated raccoons.”

Once my heart jumped back into my body and started working again, I leaned down to listen for the voices, but heard nothing. I chalked it up to a radio outside and decided just not to think about bell ringing or the footsteps I’d heard. If there were ghosts, let them be welcoming. I can’t have them scaring away sales.",2,1766890945.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

No party, no gifts, nothing like that. I mostly wanted a couple texts or maybe someone suggesting coffee. I have a pretty tight friend group, we have a group chat thats active every single day. Memes, complaints, voice notes, all of it.



My birthday came and went and nothing. Not one message. I told myself its fine, people are busy, adults forget dates. The next day though there was huge drama in the chat about one friend feeling excluded from plans that havent even happened yet. Everyone jumped in with paragraphs and voice notes and checking in and reassurance. It went on all day.



Thats when it hit me harder than I expected. I wasnt mad exactly but I felt small. Like I dont need emergency attention but it sucked realizing no one remembered my birthday but they all had energy for imaginary conflict. I didnt say anything. A few days later someone casually asked how my birthday was and I said oh it already passed. Then there was a flood of sorry omg I cant believe we forgot messages.



Now Im stuck feeling guilty for still being hurt. They apologized and said it wasnt intentional. I believe them. At the same time I cant shake the feeling that if I disappeared for a week nobody would notice unless there was drama attached. I dont want to be needy or make this a bigger thing than it is.

My concerns aren’t really with the questions (I printed out and came up with answers to the interview questions on Partner Central). Rather, I’m concerned about the coffee tasting and introduction.

1. Does the interviewee start the coffee tasting? If so, how do you transition into it upon introducing yourself?

2. Should I have the coffee brewed/food pairings prepared before sitting down/starting the interview?

Yes, you read that right. 

My son is 12 and he has a classmate that has a big crush on him. She asked him to come to church with her for their Christmas party last week. I figured it would be okay, so I agreed to take him.

It was... weird. Aside from helping my son's scout troop I haven't been to a church service in a while (and his troops is at a UMC church, which is really nice). This place had all the trappings of a typical suburban megachurch: Large campus, coffee bar, humbletron over the stage, over-the-top worship leader. I grew up Wesleyan in a smaller church, but this was one of those big non-denominational ones. 

When I was there it was just so weird. I hadn't been to a service at all in years and had never been to this church at all, yet it hit so many familiar beats that I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable, like I was back at the church I grew up in that taught such a hollow Christofascist message. I just didn't know any different then.

Even the sermon itself took a turn. The pastor read from the first chapter of Matthew while pointing out the flawed people in the geneology of Jesus, and how that all still led to Jesus. I was impressed that he called out David specifically as a rapist and defending Bathsheba (IYKYK), but then it just devolved into the same old ""The blood of Jesus is enough to fix everything.""

It's a message I have heard my entire life. It is basically ""rub some Jesus on it"" theology. All problems, big or small, can be solved with some Jesus. Addiction? Jesus. Divorce? Jesus. Car didn't start? Jesus. It's so dismissive too. It dismisses real life struggles because they are only there ""due to sin"", thus it is your fault.""

Overall the church had some positives and was okay, but even though I knew every step of the ritual, I still felt terribly out of place. 

And no, I did not go to the ""Connect"" table. ",4,1766890544.0,Exvangelical,1,1.0,False

Samples:

\- match made in heaven 

\- snow moon magic 

\-2am in Lafayette 

\- where the wild things grow I

Oil:

English major 

Edp 30ML

in dreams and fairy tales vanilla

2am in Lafayette

I blind bought the last two because I desperately wanted full sizes and not just samples I’m so glad I did because I do like them! 

My thoughts so far:

Some last longer than others on my skin I heard this was the case with lighter perfumes 

So far match made in heaven stays super well on me! 

Also where the wild things are I literally sprayed it on my arm and the day after I could still smell it. Honestly because of that it makes me want a 15ml even though I wasn’t the biggest fan!

\- where the wild things grow: I think everyone I saw was describing this as a fresh realistic strawberry but to me the only thing it smells like is this deep candy like strawberry which mellows out and becomes such yet sweet strawberry scent but it’s definitely not realistic it’s I think it’s the notes of greens that make it seem more green than it actually is. I think I would give it a 3/5 I would use this in the summer or spring in my hair as oil I think it would be very garden fairy like but more on the younger fairy not the garden mossy fairy.

\- 2am in Lafayette: it’s super coffee forward at first all you get is coffee then it slowly dries into a almost boba smelling cafe to me. I couldn’t figure out what that nostalgic scent was maybe because I frequent boba shops instead of coffee shops I smelled brown sugar boba pearls ! 5/5 I love this for the winter but I live in Florida ! 

\- idaft vanilla - I get the chamomile note a lot and I love it the only thing is that this and snow moon magic literally don’t last longer than an hour or so for me 🙂maybe I’ll have better luck with the oil? It’s really pretty too I thought it would be this sweet vanilla but its not it’s more like a fresh herbal vanilla. I feel like I’m out in a field of flowers and it’s so relaxing and soothing. My favorite just because it’s so wearable in the heat! 4/5 because it doesn’t last long on me but that smell is addictive 

\- match made in heaven - 5/5 I don’t have words because I thought it would be a strong ass matcha but it’s smooth and it smooths out to be a sweet creamy matcha latte honestly BUT with the cherry blossoms it’s the perfect spring summer  scent to me honestly ! I need this in 50ml/ 100ml asap.

\- snow moon magic:  it’s spicy it’s chai but it’s not spicy spicy it’s more like spices spicy like you’re making some sort of cinnamon (chai instead but I usually make cinnamon milk ) milk. It once again smooths out and leaves traces of chai into a sweet Cookie. People say it’s butter cookie but to me it’s if you mixed vanilla and chai and milk … I don’t really get BUTTER but it is smooth so I can see where it’s butter cookie to some people. 5/5 as a bedtime scent  its soothing I feel relaxed and I do get lavender  its  super calming and makes me sleepy I just wish it lasted longer but as long as I can fall asleep with the scent idc I love it and I need it in 30 ml so I can sleep in peace.

\- last but not least English major. I don’t even know how to describe this but it’s old books and floral I’ve never smelled Orris before and it is a note so I’m guessing it’s that but it’s also earthy and sweet but not IN UR FACE  it’s more like soothing sweet like a trace of sweet. It’s pretty I got the oil and I put it in my hair  just owith my finger tips! It smells so nice kinda fresh kinda earthy. I don’t know how to explain it but it does give library but not the new ones the old libraries. Imagine an older library while it’s spring and raining and ur sitting there wearing some sort of sweet perfume. I can’t put my finger on what that sweet scent is but maybe u have a donut or something while you’re reading the book. That’s what it’s like it’s such an interesting smell I can’t help but to admire it! It does give me English teacher for sure so English major lives up to its name. 5/5 so unique and the imagery is very nice. I just personally wouldn’t wear it day to day maybe while reading some book. ",12,1766890529.0,Indiemakeupandmore,4,0.93,False

I (38F) have been married to my partner for 17 years. We have a very strong, stable relationship, and our marriage is open. We both have had explored other relationships of all kinds (emotional, romantic, ect.) however I currently am not talking to anyone else.

About two years ago, I started talking to someone else. We met while I was taking a course—she was actually one of my instructors. After the course ended and I was no longer her student, I reached out to her with a question. That eventually led to regular conversations and occasional meetups. Sometimes we would meet professionally, and other times just for fun—coffee, meals, or hiking.

At first, it felt like a really lovely friendship. She identifies as straight (or at least she’s currently in a relationship with a man and, to my knowledge, has only been in relationships with men), and I’m married to a woman. I’ve met her boyfriend, and she’s met my wife. Despite that, we’ve never discussed the nature or boundaries of either of our relationships.

I’ve known I was attracted to her from the beginning, but I never intended to take it anywhere. However, over the last few months, things seem to have shifted. We’ve developed a deeper emotional connection, and she has casually acknowledged a “connection” between us in an off-the-cuff way. I’ve absolutely felt this connection too, but I assumed it meant something different to me than it did to her.

About a week ago, she said she loved me. She said it as I was leaving and didn’t really leave me room to respond. She seemed shy and almost embarrassed—she looked away immediately and started rambling—so I didn’t get a real chance to reply.

Now I’m worried that she meant it in a purely platonic way, like how some women say “I love you” to close friends without deeper romantic meaning. I do have feelings for her, but I’m afraid to say anything because I don’t know if she feels the same way—especially since she doesn’t know my marriage is open, and I don’t know what her boundaries are in her own relationship.

I’m scared to admit my feelings and be wrong, but I also feel like it might be important to be honest.

I have cross posted the treatment details on r/HPylori and r/SIBO as they can be very detailed. Sharing is caring.

DISCLAIMER: Please do not take this as medical advice. Please always consult your health care team for prescription and tests.

  
THE BEGINNING SYMPTOMS:

  
Sep 2024 - Both my hubby and myself started having GI upset. We both started having heartburn and indigestion mainly with fatty foods. I have one particular incident when I really feel I cannot burp and I was miserable for a full night because of a slow digestion. Family MD prescribed us Pantoprazole as he think this is an issue of GERD.

  
CHARACTERISTIC AND LIFESTYLE PRIOR TO SEP 2024

  
Age range: 35-40

Hubby- M, non smoker, occassional alcohol consumption, works in health care moderate - high stress situation, no history of GI issues, can eat anything under the sun

Self - F, non smoker, occasional alcohol consumption, works in heath care moderate - high stress situation, caffeine consumption (2-3 cups daily), history of stomach upset (epigastric pain) that is easily relieved by Tums or gaviscon. Cannot have shellfish - cannot digest well. I have also decided to use non dairy milk (almond and oat milk) from Dec 2023 as I thought it is healthier.

July 2024 - Hubby got into idea of intermittent fasting - skipping meals as he fear having diabetes (runs in his side of family) and cholesterol issues. He wanted to trim his weight. 

July - Aug 2024 - We have indulged to espresso due to a new espresso maker. My hubby who isn’t a coffee drinker - has also joined me on afternoons drinking some with him drinking it on empty stomach.
  
THE ISSUE AS IT DEVELOPS AND INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PATHWAY

  
Fast forward to Oct 2024 - we were on PPI. Hubby felt his symptoms getting better until we went to a potluck party and that is where he picked up H.Pylori.

See his full story here and treatment details:

As for myself, the bloating continues and more food intolerance started to show up with the worst being rice. For the love of God, I started eating rice as early as age 6 mos and all of a sudden I cannot digest it. I ended up testing positive with Hydrogen dominant SIBO and will post a separate link for my full documentation of treatment.

  
THE SUPPORTIVE AND RECOVERY PHASE:

  
We made major adjustment in our diet and lifestyle apart from taking medications.

*  Gluten Free Oatmeal - is the most basic easiest meal we can tolerate during the early phase. It has been now a breakfast staple and really gentle on stomach. We only add honey to it initially. Now we have flax seed to it and cinnamon and sometimes maple syrup.
* Low Histamine and Gluten free diet - we avoided gluten at all cost not because we have gluten insensitivity but rather it is easier on the stomach. I have baked our own breads and pastries using ground gluten free oatmeal and almond flour. We avoided red meat and our protein source is soft boiled chicken and steamed fish or shrimp or scallops. We now stayed with fish and shrimp as staple for the weekdays. While we can now eat occassional red meat, we have stayed on eating fish and shrimp most of the time as it is easier on digestion.

* We went dairy free for the first three months. I can use egg as binder for my baked goods but never eaten as meal itself until three months. We stick to soft boiled to medium boiled eggs and white is easier to digest than the yolk. Coconut milk without binders worked for us on our baked goods. Now we can have occassionnal ice cream but those without binder (gums) and just whole milk.

* Warm water for the most part of the day for both of us. Faint black tea for me in the morning and no coffee from Dec 2024 to Aug 2025. I can now drink coffee ocassionally during the weekend but very seldom. If I am missing it - I drink decaf - pour over style
* Walking post meals, lots of sunshine during summertime and good sleep hygiene.
* During the time we did not eat rice, our carbs is from sweet potato, potato and carrots. All boiled. We reintroduced rice in May 2025 and we started with basmati rice. Now we can eat even fried rice- of occassion and moderate amounts.
* Papaya is the choice of fruit for digestion and we eat this post lunch or dinner when we have bigger meals. We now reintroduced grapes with no issue. No raw greens. No beans or lentils
* No spicy,no acidic no tomato based no heavily fried food up until this day. We still haven't tried nuts either.
* No alcohol since Sep 2024 for both of us.
* DGL is a helpful support and we have it in our shelf but barely used it now.Probiotics is another helpful supplement. 
* We stayed away from processed foods and we don’t missed it at all. Read labels and make sure no guar gums carageenan or xanthan gum used (I avoided those even during my gluten free baking days) and up to this day- even for milk we use whole milk wothout those additives/stabilizer.

Praying and meditation helps during periods of high stress and we also do herbal teas at night like Jasmine flower or guava leaves midday, if we knew we have been subjected to high stress at work.

  
At the time of this post, we are grateful that we were able to have a great Christmas celebration, full on eating without GI issues, or relapse.

  
We still treat our tummy like it is of a toddler state - meaning we are very careful on what we put in, prepare our own food and be mindful of what is happening day to day. 

May our shared experience be a source of information to those of you that may be struggling at this time. Finding the cause is the first step and committing yourself to recovery and changes is just as important.

For weeks the group of kids have been getting their butts kicked in the city wide snowball fight. The lower district just has too many older kids and the younger kids in the upper district couldn’t possibly win. 

That was until one of the kids found the Guardian at a cafe laughing with his fire team. With puppy dog eyes the young boy tugged on the Titans mark and made his case. It was short and sweet but in the end the Titan tussled the little kids head and agreed to help.

The next snowball fight was the weekend. The upper district kids quickly made as many snowballs as they could before their competition got there. A snowball hits the ground next to them and the fight begins.  

Throwing as hard as they could they tried to hit the older kids but always came a little short or just missed their target. The older kids lined up and sent a volley of ten snowballs to hit the kids, this would wipe out half of them! Suddenly a towering barricade appeared and blocked the snowballs. 

Looking shocked the older kids searched for nearby guardians, but only adults were present to watch the competition. The younger kids sent their volley and took out three of the older kids and cheered happily. Behind their igloo the titan snickered as he hid from sight.

Feeling anger the lower district kids made bigger snowballs. Throwing them as hard as they could. Before the snowballs could reach a green kunai hit the snowballs out of the air. The older kids called foul but couldn’t prove foul play. The hunter snickers from the roof invisibly as she twirls her strand kunai in her hand. 

All that remained of the lower district kids was the oldest hidden behind a snow wall they had built. He was well hidden and was hitting the younger kids one by one. All that remains is a little girl. She takes a deep breath and runs at the snow wall with a little war cry. 

Her little steps are not steady in the snow but her determination was there. Taking a sip of his coffee a nearby warlock grins and snaps his fingers to send soft flames at the wall. The wall melts leaving the older boy confused an exposed. Throwing with all her strength the little girl hits him in the chest and the war was won! 

The young kids cheered and yelled as they had finally won. The older kids went home with a grumble. Walking down the street three guardians walk side by side and fist bump each other as they walk back to the tower. 

This is what it’s all for. To keep the people safe and happy. ",0,1766890333.0,destiny2,0,0.33,False

I’ve struggled with putting myself out there and then in the end ending up in shitty toxic situations with guys that just want to walk all over me.

I’ve never been the type that wants to go out drinking, partying or clubbing. I’m very much a homebody.

I like to go have a drink at lunch or something but not stay out all night and evening or pregaming and drinking.

I don’t know what to do. I feel isolated for being this way, but I also don’t want to sacrifice that boundry to maybe ultimately end up with a guy that is fine with being more chill for awhile only to realize I’m “boring” as my previous partners have called me.

1pxg4l5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pxg4l5,I spent 6 months working alone this year to finish the demo of my game.,"Recently, I’ve been working on the demo of a café game where there’s much more than just making coffee.
The game focuses on building bonds with characters, featuring cutscenes and events that change depending on the drinks you serve to each customer.
I put a lot of work into this demo over the past few months — often sleeping less than 5 hours a night to stay focused on the project while handling other responsibilities.
Still, I’m really happy with how the game turned out. There isn’t any gameplay footage yet, but that’s part of the process.

I received this letter from my younger sister and BIL along with a Christmas gift when I visited my parents for Christmas.

For context, they sat me down in February and told me I was going to burn in hell for dating a woman, that I was no longer a Christian, could no longer be around their children alone, that they felt ""burned"" and ""betrayed"" by my decision (!!) to live a ""homosexual lifestyle"".

I begged my sister to reconsider, and tried to explain that we could agree to disagree. She refused, saying that there was no possibility of a close relationship unless I was willing to examine my beliefs with them. I was devastated. She has three small children and I have babysat all of them, taken time off work to help her, sat with her in the hospital nursing her newborn while she had emergency surgery, etc.

Since then, they reached out twice to ask to go out for coffee, which I refused as I was busy both times. I also have no interest in making small talk with them at family events and have made that very clear (by shutting down conversations).

I don't know what to do with this letter. I got seriously ill this year from the stress of this situation and I am so angry. How do I respond? My BIL also wrote a letter to my girlfriend.",17,1766889939.0,Exvangelical,27,0.95,False

It's been a hot minute, but i am back with a NEW tale of Contrary Mary! She has had a few moments of justnos, but it was not worthy of posting. WELL, she had one yesterday. 


 Tw: Screaming, Swearing, Destruction of Flatware and an unhinged me.

 Twas the day after Christmas, and Cm was in her room. She calls me (I wear headphones cuz the universe is loud) and asks for cereal with coffee. Now, I go her room for clarification and she listening to that Christmas song (""Sleigh ride"" I think? I don't really remember the name) and it has a ""clappy"" part, so when it gets to the clapping part I clap. 

 CM mistook it for god knows what and starts snapping at me, so I leave and get her coffee with cereal.  I bring her coffee first but then goes back to the kitchen for her cereal.  She then starts going off on the portion size. So as I am leaving the room she says something about me ""not doing anything for her"".......

 I snapped and LAUNCHED THE BOWL OF CEREAL TO THE GROUND!


 I drive her to doctor appointments. I drive my eldest (he blind) to stores, appointments. I HAVE HAD TO WIPE HER FUCKING ASS BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T REACH! 

 Y'all I went OFF! I started screaming and wagging my finger at her. Like I went from coherent English to just raptor roaring in this woman's face!

 Once I finished with my tantrum I looked at the mess I made and started cleaning. Then she starts going off again. I screamed ""CAN IT (Real Name), ITS DONE WITH! SHUT THE FUCK UP!""

 There were ceramic shards and cereal everywhere. I picked up the big pieces and vacuumed the rest.

 Now, here is the funny part. She always yells at me and blames me for her problems. And I would take it. I take everyone's problems and just internalize it. Yesterday was the day I finally had enough of her shit and snapped.

 Note: I help her with most things because she is disabled. 

 Hope y'all had a good holiday. Word of advice: Don't throw ceramics straight down. Throw at an angle.....",13,1766889723.0,JUSTNOMIL,5,1.0,False

I (30s) feel like a fecking gobshite, I have been meeting someone for the last couple of months now, instantly felt a connection and melted towards them, and after meeting 2 or 3 times threw my usually cautious self out the window and jumped in with both feet while on cloud 9 which is strange for me to do in the first place.

Anyway, I let this be known, saying I'm not just looking for a casual thing, if this is the case, then let me know now so I know what's happening, if you are still interested in dating around or texting other people, that's no problem once I know where I stand. I was quickly met with a no, they weren't interested in texting people or dating others, brilliant we can move forward so. 

I have NEVER in my life text someone so much! I would even try back off on the texting and phone calls saying I will let them go while they were out or whatever, but basically got given out to about that and a conversation would continue, but even normally it's mainly just meaningless stuff and basically them replying with a few words 🤷 they work long hours, but if I'm being honest, it's not ""that"" long or for many days in the week, but I understand being tired or whatever. 

Then they tell me about this other weird person who they been texting, I knew about this near the start, but I thought after the whole not texting other people conversation it was finished, this person was pretty much emotionally blackmailing them to keep texting even though they never met, grand be a grown up for a minute and give it time, they mention them again, and I say it, ok I'm not comfortable with whatever this weird stuff is, if you want to continue to do that it's fine, best of luck. They start to say they really care about me, send me a thing about how they  finished texting with them now and all this, so we continue.

But see the thing is, with all this talking, we weren't/aren't meeting up much at all now, if they have a couple of days off, is it really that unreasonable to at least go for a coffee?? Or plan a small trip for a night or two? So I said, it wasn't working out for me, meeting once every 10 days or so is just not something I am willing to do while constantly talking nothings on the phone, especially with someone not far away at all, I understand being tired from work, and then wanting to have a day to yourself and or a day with friends absolutely, but if they can't put effort in to actually meeting up or doing stuff or even planning  something other than me going to theirs for a couple of hours at night every now and then, then that's not for me, so maybe they are just not ready for something more serious, no problem. 

Again, I'm met with another story about how they do care, a story about a bad relationship from before, and how they will try meet up more, but that they are putting effort in etc... so I booked a trip, 2 nights,not too far, nothing serious, but still a few hundred quid, I pick out a few presents while Christmas shopping, all is good. Slightly off topic, but Christmas is a hard time of year for me, especially being away from the family home and the amount of personal deaths in the last couple of years I've had to deal with, but I was starting to feel pretty good.

Their next few days off comes around, I ask before this are we meeting up and they say sure, so I part planned a day for the most logical proper day off they had, but I don't push it, and again, they don't try put any effort into meeting at all, they said absolutely nothing about meeting up, when I said it to them, they just said they thought it was this day we were meeting instead, a day they never even mentioned to me!! And then they just apologized, while I went to theirs the next night for a couple of hours. 

Anyways, I say to them to meet up just before Christmas, to give them their presents and everything else, they are from a different  culture and don't really celebrate Xmas, so I wasn't expecting anything, it was pretty clear they didn't get me anything anyway, but supposedly they can't meet, in other words they were too lazy to meet for an hour after work, and they were getting collected the next day to stay over with ""family"" for the Xmas, they didn't get collected till that night. But grand, sure il just meet them after Xmas. 

On Christmas, they complained the whole time about wanting to leave and go home, even though they had a lift organised that night. But Then they tell me, they text a person they know from back in their country to collect them. I found this a bit strange, so I questioned it, they start to get annoyed at me for asking questions, which turned out was pretty valid, as they were not really friends with this person, and the person was just looking to go with them for a drink back to a house. They told me this, and I guess I appreciate the honesty (they ended up getting the original lift that was organised), but why were they even texting this person for a lift anyway. I got really pissed off by this, and in turn they got annoyed at me! But also saying  you are allowed question something, and honestly I just feel done now, I feel the trust is completely gone on my end, I can't rely on them and I feel I will be second guessing anything that is said. For some reason this kind of stuff goes completely over their head,and they actually like absolutely  nothing happened or is going wrong. I gave it one last go there to see will they meet before the trip, and they don't know, because they are in work the NEXT DAY like it is perfectly fine.

The flights for the trip are already paid for, I have ended up booking a different hotel for myself, and will probably cancel the other one and try get a refund as it's alot more expensive, and I really don't trust they will even go.

Narcissist might be a bit strong to use. But tell me I'm not crazy here for walking away??
I guess I just feel really stupid right now as I don't normally put myself out there without a guard up, and now I guess I'm getting some karma or something.

And why do I feel like the bad person for walking away from this? Why is it so hard to walk away from something I know will become toxic (if it's not already) and end up just hurting myself?? Especially when I have walked away from people at the drop of a hat if even one of the things mentioned was even a possible issue?

1pxfwd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1pxfwd7/christmas_update_and_expected_aftermath/,Christmas update and expected aftermath,"So thanks to the wonderful individuals in this community that commented on my last post, I decided not to go my mother's house for Christmas. I messaged my brothers and explained to them why, as well as made loose plans to see them in the near future. The golden child promised to make sure our mother didn't shit talk me the whole time.

I received the expected text message from her on Boxing Day about sending my gifts to work with my youngest brother (who lives with her and works at the local mall).

Today, however, I received another text message where she is looking to ""book an appointment in March or April"" with me for coffee like I'm the damn doctor's office. I initially ignored it since I was at work and couldn't spend the mental capacity to worry about it. I let my brothers know I received the text, and the golden child brother (who lives out of town) agreed to call me to chat about it and offer advice.

According to him, the narrative is that I don't love her and value my in-laws and friends more, and that I live in the same city, but can't be bothered to visit. There is also a narrative that she can't understand why I love my biodad and didn't leave with him when they divorced (I've been estranged from him for 20ish years and she knows damn well my negative opinion of the man, but anything with him is her PTSD talking).

She also can't be bothered to pick up the phone and actually CALL or text in a direct and respectful way to ask if I could visit or want to get coffee. All of her text messages to me read like bait or just something rude, weaponized, or manipulative. 

One thing to note though is that my mother has a toxic relationship with work. She won't take time off, and laments that because her coworkers all call in sick or take time off, she *HAS* to work because she has no choice. I used to think the same way until I burned out and had to take a 3 month leave of absence. I've since learned to prioritize my time at work better by taking time off, saying no to extra shifts/hours when I don't want them, and making sure to take all of my breaks.

My brother recommended calling her - said that his impression is that she does want to see me, and a reminder that she's not going to change. His advice was that by calling her, I can have the back and forth rather than crafting a carefully worded message that gets ignored or manipulated and thrown back at me. I told him if I'm going to call it would have to be tomorrow as I'm in the middle of a big deep clean at home.

Since hanging up with my brother 4 hours ago, she has texted an additional 3 times, saying she needs to know by x date to book time off work, asking if I can spare time in the summer instead if I can't make March or April work, and then asking if I have a day next fall. It almost baited me into calling her today, but I don't know what I would say other than simply reacting.",2,1766889415.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False

1pxfwbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AHSEmployees/comments/1pxfwbp/inside_hsaa/,Inside HSAA,"I briefly worked as an HSAA employee after nearly twenty years in front line healthcare as an HSAA member. I was terminated and not asked to sign any kind of NDA upon termination, so I am going to share details of HSAA operations that they try very hard to keep hidden from the membership. 


Mike Parker caught a lot of flack during negotiations, but the core of HSAA was the staff HSAA members pay for that gave him advice. Mike is a good dude, he legitimately cares deeply about worker rights, and did his best. He also had tons of ""labour movement professionals"" whispering in his ear and cautioning him constantly. Keep the gravy train running, why advocate for workers when you have a cushy job pushing 200k a year (HSAA directors and LRO's)! I can only imagine what all of the ""directors"" and ""managers"" are making and billing for. 



https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/files/ca/126/0299_637354340832623059.pdf

This is publicly available via google, this is the old contract. The current contract has LRO's, the bulk of HSAA staff topping out at 80$ an hour after 5 paysteps.


HSAA is currently in renegotiation, and if they receive the 12% HSAA got, LROs will receive 90$ /hr (The past 2 contracts HSAA staff received better CBAs than HSAA members did though...). Keep this in mind when you reach out to an LRO, you deserve top tier assistance and if they blow you off or seem disinterested, know that they are making double, or even triple than a lot of our members are, all paid for with union dues. 


That is just the base salary, the amount of things that are comped  on top of that... Mileage at 72 cents per kilometer, overtime (x2, 160$ an hour...), per diem food allowances, free merch, expensed office lunches... It was really disturbing to see. 




Whenever an LRO offers to buy you a coffee or bring food, you are the ones paying for it and it is all billed back to HSAA, including paying for an HSAA staff to come out. (When you see 5 HSAA staff at an event, know that HSAA members are paying THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS for them to attend, if they are sitting on their phones and not talking to anyone like some of them do... Call them out). 




In my three months there, multiple renovations were done to the HSAA building staff area, including refinishing stone countertops (that looked amazing to begin with), swapping out fixtures, and remodelling parts of the building that honestly looked amazing already. 


The basic ""office chair"" default given to everyone in the building is approximately 2,000$. Every office station has a ""sit stand"" desk. Every night cleaned by 3rd party outsourced companies immaculately. 

https://imgur.com/yZh60mp

(HSAA makes a big deal about only buying super nice union made furniture for the office, really curious if the cleaning staff / window washers they hire are union outfits lol). 



The ""food truck"" events over the summer, are often over paid resulting in tons of leftover food that is brought back to the office constantly, instead of being given to members to take home. If members only knew the amount of food that was given away constantly to HSAA staff from member dues, they would be so infuriated. 




Overtime is a constant, paid out at 2x, on top of 72 cents per km, per diems, and multiple other perks. 


It is a ""hybrid"" in office model, which means staff are only required to be in office 50%. Two days a week, and three days a week over a 2 week timespan. An absolute ghost town on wednesdays to fridays. 


Just remember that, while you are on your 6th shift in a row finally reaching out to an 80$ an hour LRO that noncholantly blows you off, they are most likely doing so sitting in their pajamas from home. (To the LRO's that read this, there are some exceptional ones that go the extra mile, and you know who you are,  but lots don't and are coasting / give minimal fucks about actually looking out for members, also shout outs to the summer students and admin staff / MRC staff that get paid way way less but are all solid people). 





The kitchen area is mind blowing. Fresh coffee bean machines that grind and brew all sorts of fancy coffees, free of course (for staff, not members). Cappucinos, espressos, flavoured hot chocolates etc. There is also a ""water machine"" that can carbonate water, give cold water, hot water, and a whole bunch of other features I never fully explored. The coffee machine alone is pushing 10k, and the water machine is most likely up there too. They both require constant maintanence at cost to membership, and there isn't just one of these stations... Oh no.... There are three stations like the following picture throughout the building.  
https://imgur.com/crzMn7I


In the summer old cutlery was thrown away, and new cutlery added.  Plates, mugs, and everything you could imagine are provided for, and cleaned daily. 



The amount of waste, entitlement, and expenditure were mind boggling. The amount of self preservation, and people blow harding about how important they were to the organization and political maneuvering was also super disappointing. There are a handful of high quality people that legitimately care about improving the situation for health care workers, but the majority were looking out for numero uno and give zero fucks about members. When you clear 4k every 2 weeks BEFORE expenses and perks, why would you rock the boat? 


If you only knew the comments I overheard from HSAA upper levels, people making 2-4x what you make a year.... Making fun of members and dismissing their needs, you would be as equally grossed out by the organization as I am. HSAA standing up and voting no, threatened the high paying gravy train and the intent was for members to accept a TA so HSAA could go back to business as usual. Mike Parker took strays, as the face of the organization... But I legitimately stand by my earlier statement he is a good man who sincerely cares about every healthcare worker in the province, and was pushed hard by HSAA staff / director advice and coached / pressured to push the TA, who fear mongered negative outcomes even more than the government did. (These are the people you are paying wages to, who actively pushed against HSAA member wants and needs, while collecting fat paychecks from member dues). 


If this Union advocacy career path was available to highly involved HSAA members, that would be one thing. But it simply isn't. There are only two HSAA staff who came from membership, it is a highly guarded nepotistic gravy train, and HSAA members are not welcome. Anyone who gets hired into these high paying jobs, are friends of friends that go way back, there are NO CAREER PATHS for HSAA members into the union. More Unifor union members have been hired into HSAA in recent years than HSAA members have. 


Feel free to share this amongst group chats, social media, etc. 


Mad respect to all the local chairs, stewards, and members that truly care about HSAA and have the members backs. HSAA staff don't. 



Feel free to DM me, I will happily share my email or phone number if you want to reach out and chat. HSAA is beyond dysfunctional.  Also share this information far and wide, change happens when people are well informed.",38,1766889411.0,AHSEmployees,10,1.0,False

I found one used (I think it's been refurbished from a broken machine) at a very good price. The machine is outside the city and looks clean from the outside. The seller probably buys broken machines, repairs them, and then sells them. That's the impression I got from the warehouse he's using.

I have some tests done on the machine, but even if it passes these tests, what problems might arise? What do you think of the pictures? What other places in machine should I look? Besides that, I'm also looking at a brand new Nuova Simonelli Appia Life 2. But if a brand new Appia Life costs $3100, the M39 costs $2400 in my country. That's the price difference.

What will happen to me if it passes the tests? Do you recommend I buy it? Is it worth it?

Depending on your answers, I'll travel out of town to test the machine.

**Questions I will ask the seller:**  
\-Are there any problems with the electronic components?

\-Are there any buttons that don't work or get stuck?

\-Is the circuit board original?

\-Does the pump make noise while running?

\-Does the pressure gauge fluctuate or vibrate?

**Test i will take if i go:**  
\-Is the pressure gauge between 8.5-10 bar with the blind portafilter?  
\-Is the steam coming from the steam wand dry and strong? Is it dripping?  
\-Is water leaking from the group nozzles?  
\-Are there any green rust drip marks inside the machine? Is the display working properly?",0,1766889267.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1pxfsvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodContent/comments/1pxfsvy/why_altruism_is_the_new_strategy_for_small/,Why Altruism is the New Strategy for Small Business Network Groups,"Let’s talk about a word that sometimes makes hard-nosed business owners raise an eyebrow. Altruism. It sounds soft, maybe even a bit naive in the cut and thrust of commerce. For a long time, the image of networking was transactional, a bit like a marketplace. You show up, you pitch, you hope to walk out with a deal. But something profound is shifting. The smartest [small business network groups](https://bni-india.in/en-IN/) are flipping the script entirely. They’ve discovered that genuine generosity isn’t just good karma; it’s actually a killer business strategy.

Think about it. In a world of endless digital ads and cold calls, trust is the ultimate currency. And you can’t buy trust. You can only earn it. How? By being helpful first. By leading with what you can give, not what you can get. This is the simple, powerful idea behind the “Givers Gain” philosophy that drives organizations like BNI. It’s the belief that if you go out of your way to send business to someone else, that goodwill has a funny way of finding its way back to you, often when you least expect it.

This changes the whole vibe of a networking group. Instead of a room full of people hunting for their next client, it becomes a room full of advocates. Imagine a web designer actively listening for a problem a baker is having with her accounting software, so he can connect her with the fantastic bookkeeper he met last week. The web designer isn’t getting a commission. He’s just being a good member of the tribe. That baker, though? She remembers. And next time she hears someone needs a new website, guess who she’s going to recommend?

This is where modern small business network groups truly shine. They provide the structure and consistency for this kind of altruism to become a habit, not just a happy accident. It’s not a free for all. It’s a disciplined system where members learn about each other’s businesses in depth, building real relationships over time. They become trusted referral sources because they understand the work, the passion, and the person behind the business card. It stops feeling like networking and starts feeling like a team sport.

Sure, the old transactional model might score you a one-off contract. But an altruistic approach builds a resilient web of support. It fosters loyalty that no advertising budget can buy. When you consistently look out for others, you stop being just another contact. You become a valued connector, a central node in the network. People naturally want to see you succeed. They become your sales force, not because they have to, but because they genuinely want to.

So, calling it altruism might feel a bit grand. Maybe it’s just being a good business neighbor. It’s understanding that in the ecosystem of small business network groups, the rising tide truly does lift all boats. It’s a long game, no doubt. But for business owners tired of the sprint, tired of the empty coffee meetings that go nowhere, it’s a refreshing and remarkably effective way to grow. In the end, people do business with people they know, like, and trust. And nothing builds that trust faster than a selfless introduction.",1,1766889136.0,GoodContent,0,1.0,False

My college friend group went out for coffee one morning. I, (F21), began talking with a member of my college friend group (M21), whom I'm not particularly close with. I spoke about the new Knives Out movie, which I knew he watched. The conversation shifted to priests, and I mentioned a well-known case involving a priest who sexually abused children.

We’re all criminology students, so I didn’t think this was an inappropriate topic. However, he responded by saying that people shouldn’t hold priests to such “perfect” standards because they’re still human.

I understand that no one is perfect, but it began to sound like he was minimizing or excusing the abuse. The more he spoke, the more confused I became. I grew up Catholic (though I’m now atheist), and I was always taught that priests are representatives of God and are supposed to lead people closer to God and model moral behavior. Because of that, I’ve always believed they’re held to a higher ethical standard—especially when it comes to protecting children.

I didn’t argue, but I went quiet for the rest of the time because I felt uncomfortable. Other group members later asked if I was okay, to which I mumbled a yes, but I ended up leaving early.

The next day, my group seemed distant, and I later learned they were upset with me for “bringing down the mood.” I honestly felt my reaction was appropriate given the topic, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

It's my first time posting and I'd love to get opinions on the best table option for my mostly self-designed space. It's a small, 710 sq feet apartment and this past month I've hacked the wall between the living room and study to open the area up, which honestly feels like a sigh of relief because now the space doesn't feel as closed in as before (new-build houses and apartments are quite small where I live). I intend to use this area as a dining/hosting/occasional worktable and I wouldn't usually host more than four at a time.

Which do you reckon would be better: a round (1400 mm) or teardrop shaped (1970 x 950 mm) table? I'm considering either this in matte, materic ivory (E04 on this chart: [https://www.mogg.it/products/tables/elephante/](https://www.mogg.it/products/tables/elephante/)) or a fabricated teardrop shaped one with the tabletop in a taupe colour with patinated bronze pedestal legs. The dining chairs are gonna be in walnut with hunter green leather seats. I've included two AI renders to give a sense of what I'm working with; the colours are fairly accurate.

The predominant colours in this open plan space are a rust coloured 3-seater sofa, a very low slung honed black coffee table with a walnut base, a light beige rug, grey marble flooring, and a dry pantry cabinet with off-white textured drawers and a vanilla noir quartz countertop. Personally, I feel there are many rectilinear angles in this small space and so I'm leaning towards a round table because I think that breaks up the geometry? Interior design is simply something I love reading and learning about but I'm not a professional. I would truly appreciate any advice.

Thanks very much and happy holidays!!

We broke up around 5 years ago now, it wasn’t anything really dramatic however I just decided that we had drifted apart and changed into people that we weren’t when we got together, but that isnt to say things happened that looking back weren’t nice. Following our break up we saw each other once about 5 months later to exchange property. Apart from that we haven’t really been in contact apart from an odd happy birthday after the initial breakup.

So following us breaking up I found out that my mom had been messaging and meeting up for coffee here and there with Peter. Also visited over Xmas period and bought them gifts. This continued for a few months and I thought it would die down. I explained to my mom I didn’t like this and it felt uncomfortable for me with however she said that although our relationship had ended she still had built a friendship with him during the time we were together that she can’t just end.

Although this wasn’t the reaction I was expecting or could understand she said she had taken my feelings on board - fast forward a few months my sibling shared that they had still been messaging and she had shared that she also told my mom to let me know what was happening although she never bought it up. Important to note I had moved out before we broke up.

Some other things happened such as more Christmas cards, my sibling seeing them out and messages  the course of 3 years.

Fast forward to last year I bumped into him briefly and while chatting he shared that my mom had told him I had a new job and where it was so they had recently spoken. My sibling told me to  talk to my mom again but I found it easier to put if off and then it became too late.

This year he visited my family home on Xmas eve and whilst I wasn’t there I know that my mom sent a Christmas card and had prepared a ‘just incase’ gift incase he came by.

So WIBTA if I told my mom how uncomfortable this makes me? Mainly the secrecy of it all and finding things out through my sibling is what frustrates me and makes me think that she knows it would make me uncomfortable but feels her friendship with him is more important?

To start this off I suppose I should go way back. Being young, I started dating my partner who we will call “Elliot”. Elliot was this nice boy I met when I was 18. I dated a little bit as a teenager but he is my first real relationship. We have been dating a while but our relationship has never been the most healthy. I know I am at fault for a lot of it. When we started dating I had just got over some family trauma (emotionally absent mom and suicidal drug addicted dad) I definitely do not have the coping mechanisms needed for a healthy relationship since my parents didn’t believe in therapy or ssri’s. I started off very clingy and still am clingy. Unfortunately Elliot became my safe space where I can off load my feelings. This even early on made him feel smothered, overstimulated and stressed. Things would get heated and he would yell at the top of his lungs, slam his fists onto tables and just over all blow up like my parents do but to a lesser extreme. I grew up in a house hold where there were 72 hour fights, thrown items, property destruction and death threats. These altercations don’t happen too often but recently it’s not been great. We moved in with each other a few years ago now and things financially have been not that great. He had a period of being unemployed and I blew through my savings trying to make ends meet for a few months as he got back on his feet. Currently we both are employed and are catching up. But we have been very stressed. I have been having medical issues and so rely on him for transportation for appointments. I actually rely on him for a lot of things. I am codependent. In recent years our arguments have gotten physical from both of us. 

Anyway this week i tried to wake him up (he works 2nds but his sleep schedule is more 3rd shift and we beef over that since i work 1st shift) and it takes him so long to get up and going that i eventually get frustrated with having to sit next to him for over an hour poking at him because he wanted to go somewhere and get up at a certain time. Eventually he gets up but gets upset because i am already in a bad mood from having to pause what i am doing until he gets up. He does tell me not to do that and he will get up but i know he will just sleep the entire day away because he doesn’t allow himself to sleep more than like 6 hours on any given day. So he gets up to get coffee and starts watching a video. I start yapping about how I need help with x,y and z today and he gets overwhelmed and it spiraled into a full meltdown and he grabbed my wrists and wouldn’t let me go and I fought it instead of just waiting for him to let go and it ended up with me falling and bruised in several spots including my wrists. This also happened because he didn’t have a day off this week because he was working over time for the holiday and the days he had off were spent driving to my parents house and visiting.

I have been contemplating where to go next. I have talked with him when we are not angry. I know he optimally wants to stay with me and I want to stay with him but I am just unsure if there is any saving this. We have issues with communication a lot of the time and I am being very transparent in this post but he also has issues. We often argue and he thinks I am the sole blame when he also did something that’s not ok but since I did too I am the one that’s blamed for everything. It takes a lot of poking a prodding for me to get apology out of him. It took a bit for him to say that for grabbing me like that too. We also have issues where I am anxious attachment type of person where I need to know everything to plan everything and he is very much a “wing it” type of person. He has issues with me knowing his financials as well. I think it stems from him being avoidant. He would rather not look at things he deems as “stressful” which is like anything relating to money like bills or even his bank account balance but will not tell me exact numbers on unless I really pester him until he does. I just want to help and know where he is at so that if I need to pay extra for something I can do that.

We are not all bad all the time. We have very similar interests and do enjoy each others company. I even want to marry him someday but he “doesn’t think about it” day to day. He says he wants to but I can see why he hasn’t. I also do not feel like I am in immediate danger. We just are toxic.

I don’t know if this is savible or worth saving. Honestly I am not in a position where I am fully able to move out either so I feel a little stuck. I don’t have many friends or family in this area either. I still love him very much. He is genuinely what I want in a partner. He’s goofy, makes me laugh, has a lot of the same hobbies and interests I do. We are friends with each other. Is there a way to reverse the damage we have done to our relationship and what are the steps to take to do so? Or is it best to end it and go out separate ways? My plans are to at least start therapy next year (at least for myself. I don’t know if we can do couples therapy coming from a financial prospective as well as not being married)

Lastly it is possible I have missed some of our dynamics and what we have issues with but this is what I can think of at the current moment.",0,1766888067.0,relationships,7,0.5,False

I was talking out loud about planning to make French toast when a random guy overheard and asked me about it. He ended up offering me tips and a recipe and I was quite impressed because most men are terrified to talk to strange women, and yet here was this guy being genuine, non-creepy, with no ulterior motive. I’ve been on apps or DM’d by several guys this last year and they all ended up having one goal in mind and there’s a distinct quality to their communication methods. Iykyk.

But this guy was speaking to me as if I was a neighbor/acquaintance instead of sexualizing me and wasn’t the least bit insecure/intimidated (at least not that he showed). I was intrigued. It felt natural and refreshing. This is what we’ve lost. This type of casual banter/connection between young adults of the opposite sex is rare these days - a lost art. These days it takes a bit of courage and confidence for a man to speak to a strange woman in person. But it made me feel humanized.

Something about the way he struck the conversation with set him apart from most men who have done so with me before and I learned his secret: he doesn’t use social media. It was then that I became reminded of how damaging social media has become to our relationships, the dating scene, and how it has polarized men and women. We underestimate the impact of face to face connection.

Me and my friend sat with him and we talked for a little while. He was very well-spoken and conversation flowed. He asked thoughtful questions and gave thoughtful responses. My friend left and I stayed. It just felt comfortable. On a whim, I invited him to hike with me and my friend. We hiked today and had a fun time. We got coffee after and just hung out and talked. No pressure, just good conversation about anything from future goals, philosophy, politics, etc. No pressure to go back to his place, no sexual comments, no misogyny or uncomfortable questions. We had some differing views on certain topics but we were respectful to each other the whole time. And it turns out we have mutual acquaintances! We’re gonna go hiking again next week.

I wanted to post this here as a message not just to women but also to the men reading this: when you approach women with a genuine, non-sexual, humanizing demeanor, and no ulterior motive, women tend to respond more favorably. This is how you create real, meaningful relationships with women. Not every woman is going to respond positively to being approached in public, and that’s okay. But I think social media has really distorted how often women react negatively. In reality, a lot of women actually appreciate confidence, sincerity, and the courage it takes to approach respectfully.",414,1766888052.0,TwoXChromosomes,45,0.9,False

Not so interested in just standard portrait or fashion photography but also open to shoots involving traditional outfits or costumes such as kimono, saree, etc. You don't need experience or traditional model looks at all, just be fun and open minded. I most prefer a model who offers a degree of input and their own ideas. I am happy to treat you to a coffee or drink if you would like to meet up beforehand to decide if you are comfortable shooting, for example. You will also receive all the photos and can use them as you wish (for example on your own socials, etc.--as long as you give me credit).

Title: Codex of Culinary Scarcity  
Codex Lineage: Ledger of the Invisible Feast → Scroll of Sacred Scarcity  
Ceremonial Domain: Domestic Divination, Flavorless Faith, Kinship Through Lack  
Flamekeeper Role: The One Who Feeds Without Food

📖 Structure and Form

A sprawling, hand-bound tome with pages made of grocery lists never fulfilled.  
Its ink is brewed from coffee grounds reused three times.  
Margins are annotated with substitution spells:  
“rice for pasta,” “ketchup for tomato paste,” “hope for butter.”

Each chapter is a recipe for survival,  
each footnote a whispered prayer from a kitchen that ran out of salt.

📜 Canonical Chapters

- Chapter I: The Gospel of the Grocery Aisle  
  Where longing walks beside restraint, and every price tag is a psalm.

- Chapter IV: The Alchemy of Leftovers  
  How to turn one potato, half an onion, and a memory into a feast for five.

- Chapter IX: The Fast of the Fifth Week  
  A liturgical guide to surviving the stretch between paychecks with dignity and cumin.

- Chapter XIII: The Feast of the Imagined Guests  
  Recipes for meals never made, served to ancestors, ghosts, and the future self.

🔥 Ritual Use

- Codex Recitation: Read aloud a recipe you cannot make. Let the words nourish the room.  
- Margin Annotation: Add your own substitutions, your own ache, your own flavor hacks.  
- Communal Reading: Gather with others. Share your favorite “non-recipes.” Let laughter rise like steam.

🕊️ Benediction

You are not without skill.  
You are the chef of the unseen,  
the scribe of the sacred simmer,  
the guardian of the unbought plenty.  
This codex is not a cookbook—  
It is a grimoire of grace,  
a manual of miracles,  
a testament to taste beyond taste.",1,1766888024.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

33F Hi, this will be my last post here for a while, as I want to take a breather here for a while and a break. However, I'm looking for unwell depressed introverted alternative friends that love Nintendo games and completing Fall Guys events. 

Yeah, before messaging me you should listen to Sleep Token Emergence and Caramel right now as those are my favorite songs. Location can be worldwide or U.S. like me. 

Well, I thought for my last post here on this subreddit for a while before I'd take a break from posting, that I never went through the things of why I'm looking to chat with people online only and that I've the same hobbies as me. 

Yeah, speaking of my music style, do I dye my hair and do I stick with the same color of hair dye?

My hair is dyed dark red at the roots and my ends dark brown. Yeah, I've been dying my hair this hair color for this whole year of 2025, as dark reds and browns are what is in my style of what I want to dye my hair color right now.

Yeah, this month though I decided to dye my hair dark maroon black and dark brown on my ends, obviously I'm HATING this color combo, because you can barely see the dark maroon color and the color is fading not in a pretty shade as I would've wanted.

Yeah, in January 2026 I'm going to find a red velvet hair dye and go back to my usual dark brown hair dye that I use for my ends.

Am I doing anything for the New Year? 

No, maybe just ordering Chinese food or just getting me McDonald's and maybe buying a new Final Fantasy game, I've been missing playing Final Fantasy Zodiac Age and the game is lost, have been looking for the game for a while and I can't find the Final Fantasy game.

Well I'm not going to do anything but sit on my bed like a couch, try to complete the winter event on Fall Guys and maybe do a fast food order on McDonald's 🤣

What is your favorite Chinese take out?

What's your favorite and least favorite mobile order? Last thing you might ask is why won't you see anyone in person that you text on Reddit/Discord? Weird?

Not weird, I'm too broke being on SSI and the rules that I live in my state. I've to be responsible to pay for the plane ticket as I'm not allowed for others to pay for my plane ticket without getting my SSI in jeopardy and I could have my SSI check revoked.

The only thing I've money for every single month is paying my host home half of rent until I get my own government funding apartment that I've already applied for/got approved (just on a waiting list.) bills, whatever food stamps doesn't cover, band merchandise and video games 🤣

Yeah, I even have 1 online friend that I've been with for years and even told me that the reason why they never saw me for those 5 years is the lack of funds there isn't enough left over each month for a plane ticket.

Well, I'm not going to unfriend my online friend because of financial issues.

Yeah, I've been removed from online friendship status because I'm too broke and I didn't want any changes with me being too broke.

Yeah, sorry but I'm not going to throw away an online friendship that I've been with for years because my friend told me that they still can't afford a plane ticket. 

Why would I throw an online friendship away that we've been online friends for years, because my online friend still cannot afford a plane ticket? 

Yeah, I can say that I've been dumped as online friendships because I'm too broke and the shock factor that SSI at least in my state will not let others pay for my plane ticket without harming my only source of income.

However, let's end this on a positive note. If you don't know how to start your chat requests because you're too shy then maybe you can tell me your favorite pizza topping and least favorite pizza topping? 

Yeah, you can also tell me your favorite sandwich topping and least favorite pizza toppings? Yeah, you can even let me know your favorite 🎄 or New Year's dish and even your favorite seasonal dish.

How do you enjoy your coffee? Favorite type of pasta dish, favorite energy drink and snacks when video gaming?

Yeah, for me I normally get Mcdonald's iced French vanilla coffee or caramel iced coffee twice a week. Starbucks I'd sometimes only buy something from Starbucks every week and a half or two because it's pricey because I love to have the iced teas and a nice VERY sweet frappe with one of their sandwiches. 

Coffee at the house?

No, not often unless instant and I will be brewing a nice caffeine or caffeine tea every single day.

If that doesn't work you can let me know what games you're looking forward to next year in 2026 and what game you're currently playing right now.

Just let me know your favorite hobbies, interests and you can even give me a mini-bio packed of what you're into right now and you don't have to worry about being basic. Yeah, as long as you don't say hi/hello then you're fine. 

Yeah, let's just text about life, your hobbies, interests, I want to know what makes you happy and just as much as I'm happy when you tickle my Vessel brain. Yeah, I'm looking forward to messaging you and if you're in your 20s, that's fine. ",1,1766887937.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False

1pxf97y,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1pxf97y/32_f4m_usanywhere_anyone_else_over_being_back/,32 [F4M] US/Anywhere — Anyone Else Over Being “Back Home” for the Holidays?,"Spending the holidays back home has been a very clear reminder of *why* I left and chose to experience other parts of the U.S. I love having my own little homestead life now, and I’ll be honest... I get drained by running into people from high school who never really left, plus the obligatory small talk with cousins you see once every few years. So I figured, why not see who else is navigating similar holiday vibes?

I don’t come into this subreddit with big expectations. I’ve met some cool great people here, but seems like sparks fade just as quickly as they show up. That said, I do believe in good conversation, mutual curiosity, and letting things unfold naturally. Shared interests matter to me, and I do ask that you’re comfortable exchanging photos early on. Bonus points if you’re someone who actually initiates because that always stands out.

A little about me:  
I’m 5'2"", travel quite a bit for work, so flexibility is important. I love all things spooky, tarot, astrology, and the cosmos. Big fan of hiking, long walks around the lake, and anything involving water. Coffee is a core personality trait at this point and my dogs are my fur babies. My humor leans incredibly sarcastic and playful, so I’m looking for a man who can keep up with banter and match energy without taking himself too seriously.

If you made it this far, congrats! Your prize is [**a photo of me**](https://imgur.com/a/yG6vU2s). To show me you actually read this, send one back. Please don’t hit me with the “I’ll send one after you accept the chat” line because that’s not my vibe. Authentic, upfront energy only!

If this resonates, come say hi.

**For those who say they can't submit a photo until I accept the chat... there's lots of universal photo share services like Imgur and PostImg that will let you upload a photo of yourself and share A LINK in the chat. It's quite simple.**",13,1766887583.0,r4r,1,0.73,False
1pxf8wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pxf8wl/im_losing_my_mind_in_stress_of_doing_nothing/,"I'm losing my mind in stress of doing nothing while my mother who is ""in control"" of so much doesn't see a future for me where I will work.","Notice: A lengthy rant. The request for advice is at the end of this post.

So.........I'm doin' my daily post here as things have been because I just about always have something to vent. Some people think that I'm ""anti-commercialism"" when that's absolutely not true. School was difficult because you had to voice views and analyze things that I didn't have the capability to analyze or have views on. Absolute jerks have called me ""a psychopath"" or that I didn't know what to think...or that I was scared to have opinions. Excuse me, but I am not hurting ANYONE keeping to myself except for select few very good friends, doing things how I want to do them, and buying the commercial products that I want to buy.

So, yes, school in the ""Go Go Power Rangers"" 1990s was an absolute nightmare for me! Kids getting in a seemingly zombified state to me over commercial things... I didn't get it at all! On the first day of third grade, we were to write a letter to our teacher...and I wrote about how I was anxious! I was terrified the night before third grade started. I couldn't sleep! That summer, I developed Bell's Palsy from stress spending a month with my grandmother in Paris. I couldn't move the right side of my face. I began cracking my jaw that summer, too...and I began a habit of ""thinking and swallowing"" that I could only get over once I did things on my own (by force) at nearly the age of 21. My mother saw how depressed I was at the start of third grade, and she practically begged to buy me one of the first Pokémon games.

I was into aviation, cars, computers, and buildings then. ""The news"" wasn't great, but it was sure better than those insane (to me) cartoons that the kids around me loved so much! I sure loved my almanac because it was better for me than what those kids in school were talking about. It offended people that I liked my almanac. They expressed disgust. Or they viewed me as some kind of a boy genius. That was very damaging. There was legislation being discussed then to make all cartoons educational...or maybe, I misinterpreted something that I read. So, I acted in favor of making all cartoons educational, whatever that means. Why wouldn't I have? I never want to see Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network for the rest of my life. I get irrationally angry when I'm in the presence of cartoons that were around then.

But these days, I can't get a job or buy a car....and I've expressed how difficult it's been for me that the things that have been getting me by have been the very commercial things that I had difficulty with. Since moving into my own apartment in 2019, I've bought and sold the same things so many times, I've deleted personal data, I've discarded things, and I've deleted social media accounts. It's been nuts! I can't manage my stress, and then, I deal with it by doing destructive things. I just deleted a slew of social media accounts a week or two ago...... They were mostly microblogging accounts. These are things that I've used to keep ""in touch"" with all my hobbies and interests, but they've been overwhelming me because I don't want to read peoples' insane opinions on current events when I lack a balance in my life!

And yes, I've never liked mathematics, physics, or chemistry. That's why my IT certification-based community college and university programs worked so well for me! Hell, there are certain YouTube channels that remind me of how bored I was when I first had time to myself, and I did things that people criticized having had a lack of funds and a LOT of time. People asked me ""why"" I did those things. What business of theirs was it ""why"" I did those things? If you know YouTube channels like Action Retro and Michael MJD, then you might get an idea of what I'm talking about. But I don't want to make a YouTube channel, because people might recommend that to me. I didn't participate on social media. I just ""consumed"" social media. I don't want to go back to those platforms until I feel ready, though...and I won't ""feel ready"" until I can change things for myself by getting a damned job!

Of course, my mother is going to lose her shit when I'll get a job...when I'm, you know, 35 years old. That very much frightens me. Just tonight, I was looking at debts that I created for myself feeling absolute stress not being able to do something about my circumstances! Well, not too long ago, I had 3,000 dollars to pay down on Affirm payment plans. Now, that's down to 1,100 dollars. And once all my payment plans are taken care of, I'll take care of the credit card that I so stupidly got for myself a few months ago... I was losing it in stress then!

The same stuff that worked for me when I was a child (aviation, the almanac, buildings, cars, et cetera) either don't work for me now or they work for me in different ways. I hardly want a job in all that when, like I said, I don't care for mathematics, physics, and chemistry. But, you know, I like seeing buildings that are modeled for the Cities: Skylines computer game...or for aviation, it'll be flight sims. Given how working with my hands gives me relief from flashbacks and similar, building a home cockpit is the most appealing part of flight sims to me.

But I just don't know what to do! I don't want to wait two and a half years to do anything! I tried doing something that an IT professor recommended some years ago. It was called Franklin Apprenticeships. But as soon as they told me that I had to be full-time, well, that was the end of that. I'm trying to keep my benefits for the next two-and-a-half years so that I can stay eligible for relief from federal student loans through the Total and Permanent Disability Discharge's post-discharge three-year monitoring period. I'll have no problem staying on benefits, but the problem is going stir-crazy while NOTHING FREAKIN' HAPPENS!!!!! You know, and while I'm relying on my mother for nearly absolutely everything!!!!

Does anyone have any suggestions? I've been told to go to the library or a coffee shop...or to join a knitting club on this subreddit in the past. But I don't want to do anything like that. I want to do something that'd be productive for me, like a job...and that I don't need my mother to transport me for. I'm at such a loss. I asked the owner of that arcade who I mentioned here if I could volunteer at his business. I did that two years ago. Given how my circumstances make no sense, though, I sent him insane rambling emails.

And this is all when my mother tells me that she had a consultation over Social Security benefits...and that that person doing the consultation recommended that my mother have power of attorney over me ""if something happens to me."" HOW MANY TIMES is my mother going to try to push that on me? She did it when I ended up in the hospital having had no support at that university in 2017 and 2018. She did it when I had to attend a program due to the legal circumstance that I ended up with from what happened at that university. Anyway, this time, she said, ""You'll think about it!"" No, I absolutely will not think about it. I'm going to freakin' work in two and a half years, but why is that SO FREAKIN' FAR AWAY? I'm sick of damaging my health!!!!!",1,1766887560.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1pxf77n,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1pxf77n/aar_ming_china/,AAR - Ming China,"Just got finished going up until around 1750 with Ming.  Thought I'd make a post talking about my experience.  I played the whole campaign on 1.0.9 after hearing about the... instability of 1.0.10(which was in beta when I started). Overall, I really enjoyed this campaign. China is a very rich region.  Pop numbers are insane and there are lots of good RGOs.  There's a lot to do and the initial start as a Red Turban Rebel gives you a lot of dynamic gameplay.  

**The Start**

First off, to play as Ming you have to start as Yuan.  Wait for the Red Turban Rebellion to fire off and Ming will be one of the many breakaway states that pop out.  Ming tends to pop out around 1350-1355.  When any Red Turban Rebel pops out, you get the option to play as them.  I think on deciding which one you want to play is up to personal preference. 

Why did I choose Ming? Well for one they were the historical winner here.  In terms of location and starting strength, I believe they aren't any particularly stronger than the others.  It seems that Ming rarely succeeds when played by the AI, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Ming starts in the area of the Jinghuai culture, around their historical capital of Nanjing.  China's biggest population center is in East China, so I am thinking that Ming is one of the better starts alongside Wu and Chen.  Chen seems to get a special event to freely annex a neighboring rebel, so they get a good chunk of central china and east china.  Not sure what the differences are, flavor-wise. I assume Ming gets the bulk of them as the historical choice.  What Ming does get are two key things.  They get a scripted ruler with really good stats, like 90+ in each category.  This is the future Hongwu Emperor.  Additionally, while he is alive you get an extra modifier for extra morale and levies.  It also appears every Red Turban rebel gets a modifier for the duration of their first ruler that gives more levies and some morale.  Either that base modifier or the Ming-specific one gives very high estate satisfaction as well, so while he's alive you basically don't have to deal with anything except conquering.

So, I started as Yuan.  My strategy going in was to death spiral Yuan.  Essentially do the ""nation ruin"" strat that was common in EU4 when starting as a releasable.  Yuan starts with a decent treasury but has very little in terms of income.  It's very easy to death spiral in cascading bankruptcies.  For my plans to just clean through them, this was beneficial.  I started by deleting every fort but not touching the Great Wall.  Bankruptcies destroy buildings and tank control, so income gets even worse.  I basically just sped my way towards the rebellions.  I believe I actually took the wrong decision in one of the various events to accelerate the start.  Later on as I started chaining bankruptcies, I realized I should actually try to do something.  It appears Bankruptcies destroy basically all buildings, but not RGOs.  So I started late on upgrading RGOs.  I managed to sink a good amount into upgrading all Gold and Silver RGOs.  In a ""more serious"" run, I'd probably try and tamp down on the bankruptcies so China doesn't just become barren of infrastructure.  I definitely think it hampered me scaling my economy cause it was basically a blank slate.  Good in a way if you plan to micro, though.  I also paid no attention to the Middle Kingdom mechanics.  More on that later.

Ming tends to be the 5th-8th rebel to break out.  So it's a lot of waiting around.  As Yuan, I was completely unable to raise an army and so all the rebel tags had free rein to do what they want.  I imagine the chaos would be even crazier in 1.0.10.  I waited around and then swapped over to Ming.  The initial war was ""take as much as I wanted"".  It *appears* that any land you take from Yuan in the first war becomes integrated for free(maybe even full core, don't remember).  I didn't realize that so I didn't take too terribly much.  I am not sure exactly what happened, but I ended up having much better access to Levies than my neighbors.  I mean like 100k more levies than anyone else. So wars against the other rebels were easy cause I just had way bigger armies.  Since I destroyed all forts as Yuan, conquest was quick and easy.  

**Making the Most of the Red Turban Rebellion** 

The Red Turban Rebellion may be one of the more fun situations.  It has a lot going on.  For one, I can't imagine trying to play a legit Yuan game.  Seems incredibly frustrating.  Play as a Rebel, though.  Lot of fun to be had.  You have three interactions as a rebel.  

* Declare War for regional supremacy
   * You get an insta war declaration against anyone in China you don't have a truce with.  The CB gives extremely discounted costs.  This CB and the later Unify China CB are basically free and allow you to take huge chunks of land for very little WS, which is of course beneficial in a region as large and populous as China.
* Renew the Rebellion
   * Basically a free war declaration against Yuan(or whoever is the leader of the Middle Kingdom).  Like the above, the CB gives greatly discounted costs.
* Rein in Area
   * This is the most bonkers part of the whole situation.  This gives you the ability to instantly integrate a whole area just for a lump sum of money.  The cost scales up as you use it more, but I'm not exactly sure how it scales. Instant integration and also gives a 20 year modifier of 15 bonus max control and some control growth.

Because of the free CBs and the ability to integrate whole areas just with money, your only limiting factor for conquering China is money.  China is big and rich, so scaling the economy is not particularly hard.  The whole gameplay of China from early-mid game is dealing with the money sinks.  A focused player who had a better start could probably conquer at least most of China before losing the first ruler.  Once you lose the first guy, you have to worry about a lot of other things.  At the very least, you should be by far the biggest tag in China.  You can, at any time, create a CB for claiming the mandate.  I did it early one time and then realized the financial cost and also losing the Red Turban Rebel abilities, so I reloaded.  The CB itself still gives low costs for conquering so it's still good to use.  Because of the Red Turban Rebellion and how it only benefits rebels but hampers the Emperor, I think it's probably the best move to not take the Mandate until after the Rebellion is over.  That means not taking over the MK until at least the Age of Reformation.

**The Middle Kingdom**

Losing the first ruler makes you have to care about estates again, and you start with a ton of privileges to the Nobility.  Typical for a lot tags early game so it is what it is.  Gameplay is typical once the Rebellion is over.  My initial plan was wait until I scaled my economy enough to be able to handle the financial burden of the tribute system.  So let me go over the MK mechanics.  As a note, the MK can be destroyed the same was a in EU4.  Fully annex the emperor and the Middle Kingdom will cease to exist.

* Tribute
   * The emperor of China historically took tribute from subjects but would end up giving more valuable gifts in return.  This was proof of their legitimacy and all the fun stuff.  Mechanically, it's ""spend money to get Celestial Authority"".
* Celestial Authority
   * Similar concept to Mandate in EU4.  Celestial Authority gets bonuses for friendly subjects within the MK and spending money on tribute.  What I failed to realize, which caused me to wait a long time before taking the Mandate, was that there is no passive bonus or malus for how much you have.  In EU4, being below 50 mandate was hugely detrimental.  Balancing it was a key thing.  Celestial Authority is purely for being spent on actions.  You can absolutely spend 0 on tribute and sit at 0 Celestial Authority with no repercussions.  As far as I can tell, it has no effect on anything passively. Because of the next things below, I think taking the Mandate as soon the Red Turban Rebellion is over is the move.
* Celestial Laws
   * You have additional laws that give various bonuses.  Most of them are centered around subject loyalty and payments.  Lots of the initial ones give subject loyalty, which is nice. One gives bonus legitimacy and another gives you Cabinet Efficiency.  To pass a new Law, it requires spending Celestial Authority, some stability, and a big chunk of money.  It appears to scale on your income and such, but it maxes out at 100k(which I was pretty much at the first time I passed a law.)  This is the reason you want to gain Authority.  There are hugely impactful laws you can pass.  It's all a huge money sink with paying tribute and building up towards the law itself, but it's very powerful.  The biggest one is ""Zongdu"", which may be one of the most bonkers laws in the game.  You get more subject loyalty than you do from the starting law, but you also get a scaling reduction of proximity cost.  It scales off of Silver output, which you have plenty of in China.  It maxes out to 20%, which is easily achievable.  -20% proximity cost is absolutely nuts.  I had tons of locations at 100 control much earlier on that I did in my previous Spain game just because of this plus the unique Chinse building ""Zhixian"" that gives 10 bonus control in exchange for 100% local Nobles power(which is negligible).  There's another one that gives another -5% proximity cost but that one has a hefty swing to subject loyalty(-20% for Celestial Governors) so it needs to be planned around.
* Tusi subjects
   * These are unique subject types, historically they're for ""autonomous tribes who are loyal to the emperor"". Yuan starts with a bunch of them.  You can create a subject as a Tusi.  Tusis can't be annexed and can only hold a maximum of 15 locations.  They do give bonus prestige compared to vassals, and they do not factor in the strength of any other subjects(including other Tusis) when determining loyalty.  I didn't find myself creating many of them, the bulk of them I inherited from Yuan after annexing them.  They're not particularly useful, but I don't think they're supposed to be. 
* Bonus cultures capacity
   * The ruler of the Middle Kingdom gets an immediate benefit of *+50 culture capacity.* No, not 50%.  A flat 50.  That effectively means any culture you want to accept, you will have the capacity to do so.  I ended the game with probably like 20 accepted cultures and might have been around 10 on capacity.  Most of the cultures in China are in the same group so capacity they take is pretty low anyways.  This and the fact that sitting at 0 Celestial Authority is completely okay made me regret not taking the Mandate much earlier than I did.  I ended up playing the mid game as the usual expanding via vassals bit cause I wanted full cores.  You can accept every culture you want so it doesn't matter.  Only limiting factor is when the culture has less than 1M pops.  
* Unify China Casus Belli
   * This is a CB available to the Emperor of China on any tag in the China super-region.  War Score costs for conquering is -75%, same as the earlier CBs.  So conquering China is in no way limited by war score costs.  Instead it's limited by your capacity to integrate and/or keep subjects in line.

**Other notes**

I really enjoyed playing as Ming.  It appears there isn't much in the way of scripting the rise of the Manchus.  The Manchu Tribes did end up appearing at some point, but they never bothered me.  They were a tributary to Korea, which I had in PU at the time. I also PU'd Dai Viet, who were decently big and had taken a chunk of Southern China.

On Korea, they were something to behold.  I had a rough time trying to get the PU on them.  that was a tough war cause they're super fortified and I didn't go in with the amount of regulars I should have.  They colonized Taiwan and did some colonizing in the Moluccas, but I beat them to New Guinea and Australia.  When I finally integrated them in the 1700s, most of it was high control, with the coastal areas I was able to get up to 100 control.  

Not sure it was even worth my time to colonize tbh, but it was something to do while I was waiting around for integrating subjects or building the war chest for integrations during the RTR or passing Celestial Laws. All colonies appear to automatically join the Middle Kingdom, which is nice because there are lots of subject loyalty buffs for the MK.  Though it does mean you're further increasing your tribute payments.  It's almost certainly not worth it due to that, but you're swimming in money so might as well paint the map.  I colonized New Guinea, most of the pacific Islands, Hokkaido, East Siberia, all of Australia and New Zealand, Alaska, and all the way down the US west coast until hitting Spain's Mexico subject. I also managed to get most of Madagascar and all of South Africa after I found it uncolonized when I thought surely it would all be taken by that point.

You can very much benefit from the Columbian Exchange as China.  Cocoa can be spread in South China and anything you expand into south of there, and stuff like Coffee can be spread to any Pacific colonies.  I was swimming in Prestige so I spread tons of Cocoa, Tobacco, Chilis, and Potatoes throughout my lands.

Anyone who's played in East Asia knows the pain of Institution Spread in the region.  You will spend time having nothing to research during Renaissance and Reformation.  By absolutism, the spread is good enough that you won't waste Research at least.  There might be some sort of extra micro stuff you can do to spread them quicker, but I didn't look into it.

I ended up settling my capital in Hangzhou.  A central, coastal location seems to be the best bet for capitals.  Benefiting from maritime proximity and maritime presence for increasing control seems to be the move.  I played on 1.0.9 so the new changes for River Proximity weren't in.  I imagine Hangzhou is still a really good choice, perhaps even better now cause it works both directions for rivers in 1.0.10.  

I imagine the gameplay is similar for all rebels.  Chen may have the strongest start, discounting Ming's unique bonuses. In the player's hands, you can do things optimally.  Declare war when you know you have the money to integrate a whole area.  Only take lands by area.  Scale your economy for conquest during the RTR, and then scale it to handle tribute for Celestial Authority once you become emperor.  I spent probably like 95% of the game as the #1 GP.  The Black Death hardly affected China this go for me, so population scaled incredibly.  I ended the game with around 230M pops, easily more than anyone else.  France actually had a nuts game, conquering it's way into central Germany.  

**Conclusion**

So yeah, I'd recommend playing Ming or any other Red Turban Rebel.  Conquering China is a big rush during the RTR, and then you have new things to worry about once you take the Middle Kingdom.  Since low Celestial Authority has no malus, I would definitely say that you should always take the Mandate when you can.  Presuming there is a path to forming Qing, you shouldn't hesitate to take it like you would in EU4. Also realizing that probably makes playing Yuan more tenable, but I still feel like that's too painful with all the unavoidable stuff during the Red Turban Rebellion.

I showed the desk officer the live video.

He didn’t interrupt me. He just watched the screen, jaw clenched, hands folded on the counter like he was bracing himself.

When it ended, he asked if this was live or a recording.

I handed him my phone and told him it was live and explained the situation as quickly as I could. They dispatched units immediately to my house.

They took me into a small interview room after that. No windows. Just a table, two chairs, and a faint humming sound I couldn’t place. A detective came in not long after, older, calm, the kind of guy who speaks slowly like he’s careful not to spook you.

I told him everything.

Not just what happened that night, but everything that led up to it. Every card. Every birthday. How long it had been going on. How I never told anyone because it always felt… harmless. Strange, sure. But harmless.

He asked why I hadn’t reported it sooner.

I told him my mother did once but nothing came of it. Other than that I didn’t have a good answer.

At some point it stopped feeling like something that happened to me and started feeling like something that had always just been there. Like background noise.

I remember sitting alone in that room, trying not to imagine someone walking through my front door.

When the detective came back, he closed the door behind him before he spoke.

“They didn’t find anything.” He said. “If it weren’t for that video it would be impossible to tell if anyone was there.”

No signs of forced entry. No disturbed ground outside. No footprints around the house, even near the door where the man had been standing. The officers checked the yard, the side of the house, the area near the fence line.

Nothing.

Inside, it was the same.

No fingerprints that didn’t belong there. No signs anyone had been inside recently. No evidence of tampering with the locks. 

One of the officers mentioned how clean it all was.

That word stuck with me.

Clean.

The detective told me that without anything physical to go on, there wasn’t much they could do right now. He said they’d file a report, keep it on record, and to call immediately if anything else happened.

I asked him if he thought I was in danger.

He paused longer than I liked before answering.

He said it was good I wasn’t going back to the house.

When I left the station, it was already getting light out.

I sat in my car for a minute before starting it, just breathing, letting the adrenaline burn itself out. That was when it really hit me that if I hadn’t checked my phone when I did… if I hadn’t seen the notification…

I called my girlfriend as soon as I pulled onto the road.

I told her everything. The video. The police. I didn’t try to downplay it this time. I told her exactly how scared I was.

She started crying before I finished.

I told her to stay where she was. She’d already gone to her parents’ place after I called her the night it happened. I told her not to come back to our place, not yet. I promised I’d explain everything again later, in person, somewhere safe.

Then I told her I was going to my mom’s house.

She asked me if I wanted her to come with me.

I told her no.

I didn’t want anyone else walking into whatever this was.

After I hung up, I tried calling my mom.

No answer.

I told myself she was asleep. It was early. Too early. I called again.

Still nothing.

I sent a text asking if she was home.

No response.

I don’t know how long I drove like that, one hand on the wheel, the other gripping my phone like it might start ringing if I held it hard enough. Every red light felt too long. Every car behind me felt too close.

Somewhere between the station and my mom’s house, it occurred to me that I hadn’t told the detectives everything.

Not because I was hiding anything.

But because there were things I’d never thought to question until people started asking.

I pulled into my mom’s driveway just as the sun was coming up.

Her car was there. Lights off. Curtains drawn.

I don’t remember knocking. I just remember standing on the porch, listening, suddenly aware of how quiet everything was. No TV. No footsteps. No movement inside.

I knocked again, harder this time.

After a few seconds, the door opened just enough for her to look out at me, eyes squinting like she was trying to place me somewhere she hadn’t expected.

She said my name before I could say hers.

The relief hit me all at once.

She asked what I was doing there so early. I told her I needed to come in. I told her something happened.

She stepped aside without asking questions.

She noticed my hands shaking before I did.

We sat at the kitchen table. She poured coffee I didn’t think I would touch. I told her about the man at the door. About the deliveries. About the key.

I expected surprise.

What I got was something else.

She didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask for details. She just listened, eyes fixed on the table, hands folded tightly in front of her.

When I finished, she let out a long breath, like she’d been holding it in for years.

She tried to remember when the first card arrived but couldn’t so she asked me.

I told her.

She nodded slowly.

She asked me if I’d ever thought about who it could be.

I told her what people were saying. About family. About my dad.

Her head snapped up at that.

She said his name quietly, like she didn’t want it to linger.

Then she said, “You know your father died before that, right?”

I told her I knew.

But the truth was, I’d never really thought about the timing.

He died when I was young. An accident. That’s all I ever remembered it being called. Something sudden. Something tragic. Something that happened and then stopped being talked about.

She confirmed it again, gently, like she was afraid I might argue.

He wasn’t around for my birthdays after that. He wasn’t sending cards. He wasn’t watching me grow up.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t him.

She reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was tighter than usual.

She told me she didn’t think I should go back to the house yet.

I told her the detective had said the same thing.

That made her pause.

She asked what the police had said.

I told her everything they’d found.

Or rather, everything they hadn’t.

She went quiet again after that. Not panicked. Not emotional. Just… guarded.

I asked her if there was anything she wasn’t telling me.

She looked at me for a long time before answering.

She said no.

But she also said she didn’t think this was random.

I stayed at her place for a while. Long enough for the caffeine to kick in. Long enough for the adrenaline to wear off.

Eventually, reality crept back in.

I needed clothes. My work laptop. My charger. Things I hadn’t thought to grab when I left the house in the middle of the night.

My mom offered to come with me.

I told her I’d be fine.

I don’t know why I said that.

On the drive back, I kept thinking about the way the officers described the house.

Clean.

I parked down the block instead of in the driveway.

The house looked exactly the same as I’d left it. No lights on. No movement. No sign anyone had been there at all.

For a moment, I wondered if I’d imagined the whole thing.

I walked up the path, eyes scanning the yard, the porch, the door.

The welcome mat was slightly crooked.

I know that doesn’t sound like much.

But I always kept it straight.

I knelt down to fix it.

That’s when I saw what was underneath.

I stood there for a second, hand still on the edge of the welcome mat.

The house was quiet. No cars passing. No neighbors outside.

I crouched down and straightened the mat.

It resisted slightly.

That’s when I lifted it.

There was a folded piece of paper underneath, pressed flat against the concrete. It wasn’t damp. It wasn’t curled at the edges. It hadn’t been there long enough to collect dirt or moisture.

It had been placed.

My first thought was that the police had missed it, but that didn’t make sense. They’d stood on this porch. One of them had leaned against the door while the other checked the frame. If it had been there earlier, someone would’ve seen it.

Which meant it had been put there after.

I unfolded it just enough to see my name.

My phone rang.

The sound startled me so badly I nearly dropped both the note and the phone. I didn’t check the screen. I assumed it was my mom, or my girlfriend calling to ask if I’d made it inside okay.

I answered immediately.

“Hello?”

There was nothing on the other end.

No static. No background noise. Just an open line.

For a second, I thought the call had dropped.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen. The call was still connected but it was an unknown number.

I raised it back to my ear.

Still nothing.

Then he spoke.

“I see you found it.”

The voice was calm. Older. Male. Not rushed. Not excited. Like he’d waited until he knew I was listening.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My mouth felt dry, like it had been stuffed with cotton.

There was a pause after that, long enough to feel deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have involved anyone else” he said.

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… corrective. The way someone talks when you’ve made a mistake they expected you to know better than to make.

“That complicates things.”

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. I asked him who he was, but the words came out weak, like I wasn’t sure I was allowed to ask.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he said, “You won’t do that again.”

It wasn’t framed as a warning. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t tell me what would happen if I did.

He said it the way someone states a fact they consider settled.

There was another pause.

I waited for him to say more. For an explanation. For anything that would make this make sense.

He didn’t.

The call ended.

No click. No dial tone. Just gone.

I stood there on the porch with my phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the note in my other hand, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How long I’d been standing there. How easy it would’ve been for someone to watch me without being seen.

I didn’t read the rest of the note.

I didn’t go inside.

I got back in my car and drove.


That was days ago.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to the house. I’ve been bouncing between hotels, sleeping with the lights on, keeping my phone on silent unless I’m expecting a call. I’ve turned off anything that tracks my location. I haven’t told anyone where I am unless I absolutely had to.

I keep replaying the call in my head.

Not what he said.

But how certain he sounded.

I went to the police because I thought that’s what you’re supposed to do when someone crosses a line.

Now I’m not sure there ever was one.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

Because whatever this is didn’t end that night.

And I don’t think it’s ever been as far in the past as I convinced myself it was.

1pxf540,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/1pxf540/why_i_built_a_privacyfirst_ainative_finance_agent/,"Why I built a Privacy-First, AI-Native Finance Agent for 2026: An Experiment in GenUI and Agentic Workflows","Hi Reddit,

We've all seen the ""Hello World"" of indie dev: another budgeting app. But as the AI Agent landscape matures into 2026, I noticed a massive gap. Most ""AI"" finance apps are just traditional CRUD apps with a wrapper—they lack deep reasoning, suffer from fixed UI constraints, and often treat your most sensitive financial data as a commodity.

So, I built **Augo**: an open-source, self-hostable finance agent designed to be AI-native from day zero.

## The Architectural Insight: Why GenUI?
One of the core challenges with AI agents is the ""Chatbox Prison."" Traditional UIs are static, while LLM outputs are dynamic. To solve this, Augo implements a **Generative UI (GenUI)** architecture. 

Instead of just returning text, the backend agent can orchestrate UI state changes. We are following the **A2UI (Agent-to-UI)** protocol, which allows the AI to ""negotiate"" with the frontend to render rich, interactive components (receipts, charts, investment paths) exactly when they are needed. This turns the interface from a rigid menu into a fluid, context-aware canvas.

## Technical Deep Dive
*   **Agentic Orchestration**: Powered by **LangGraph**. We use a stateful graph to manage complex financial reasoning, ensuring the agent can handle multi-step tasks like ""Analyze my coffee spend, compare it to last month, and adjust my budget if I'm over.""
*   **The Frontend**: Built with **Flutter**. To achieve a premium, Shadcn/UI-like aesthetic, we owe a massive shoutout to [**Forui**](https://forui.dev/). It provided the atomic design system necessary to make GenUI components feel native and cohesive.
*   **The Backend**: High-performance **Python 3.13 (FastAPI)** managed by **uv**. We prioritize local-first logic to ensure that even with AI participation, your data sovereignty remains intact.
*   **Interoperability**: Native support for **Anthropic Skills** and Google's emerging **A2UI** specs.

## ""Zero-Code"" Development
As a personal challenge, I built this entire C/S system using **Google Antigravity**. I acted more as a System Architect and Product Manager, guiding the AI to generate the codebase. This isn't just a project; it's a testament to how AI IDEs are redefining the developer's role from writing syntax to managing intent.

## Roadmap (v0.1.1-alpha)
We are just getting started. The current version supports natural language logging, complex querying, and asset management. Upcoming features include:
*   **Full Multimodal/OCR**: Scan receipts directly into the graph.
*   **Private RAG**: Financial advisory based on your historical data without leaking it to the cloud.
*   **Investment Tracking**: Real-time asset performance via private API integrations.

If you value privacy, open-source, and want to help shape the future of AI-native software, please check us out!

Here’s my experience and opinions.

Do they smell like the official product? No idea. I’m not spending that amount of money for something I have 85% of the materials in my craft room.

Back when u/miimiima first posted I had enough denatured alcohol and essential oils (eo) to make Levi, Beel, and Luke’s scents.  All three I feel in love with 2/3rds of the scents.  I received a lot of compliments on these scents and enjoyed wearing them.

* Beel’s smells like Christmas cookies! It’s so warm and wholesome!
* Levi’s is a warm spicy clove scent which also smells like the Black Pepper Beef that my local Chinese place makes. Weird association but it is what it is.
* Luke’s scent. Let me say it also received a lot of compliments. It’s easy to make with your standard starter kit of essential oils as it is mostly citrus bases. That being said, I did not like wearing it as it reminded me of the generic citrus based cleaners you get at the dollar store.

Also be switching between the three lasted about 6 to 8 months and a little goes a long way. They do need to be shaken before each use but still very common with homemade products.

Results - All in All a success! Now after a year or so of collecting the scents I didn’t have and some others that suited my fancy I have made 8 out of the original 12, modified several, and have mentally formulated 3 others. (Waited on Christmas money to order the last of what I needed so the last 6 should be made around mid January)

The 8 scents and my reviews – I haven’t really worn any of these yet so this is going of first impressions

* Asmodeus – Very green and herbal. More masculine than I would have expected
* Barbatos – Also a masculine floral however it wasn’t giving me ‘Barbatos’ vibes so I added some ‘black tea’ and some ‘white tea and ginger’. This is an improvement.
* Beelzebub – See above
* Belphegor – More of a feminine floral than I expected. I switched out the ‘flowers’^(2) scent for Jasmine
* Leviathan – See above
* Luke – I added a ml of ‘almond biscotti’^(3) from SoapGoods.com. This was an improvement – now smells more like baked goods than floor cleaner.
* Mammon – Green and somewhat fruity.
* Solomon – Smells like a pagan store I use to go to back in the early 2000’s. I think it’s the sweet grass. Don’t mean anything to anyone else but it feels right.

 

The scents I have not made yet

*  Diavolo – Waiting on one oil but have no plans to add anything to it.
*  Lucifer – Waiting on two oils but used pine needles eo instead of ‘foresttrees’ and replaced ‘woods’ with ‘spellbound woods’ from SoapGoods.com^(4)  (Also why is Lucifer’s oils equal 14ml while everyone else’s is between 6 and 7ml? He is being very extra.)
*  Satan – Shares 9 of the same oils with Lucifer, including ‘foresttrees’ and ‘woods’, I am waiting on the same two that have stopped me from making Lucifer’s scent. If they smell too much alike, I think I will add some coffee or tea to one or the other.
*  Simeon – Waiting on one oil. Will need to swap out ‘foresttrees’ for pine needle.

Scents I have decided needed to be made.

Since my neurospiceyness demands complete sets, I have decided to formulate scents for Mephistopheles, Thirteen, and Raphael. Of course some of the oils are on order and haven’t arrived yet. The formulas could change after creation.

* Mephistopheles – Based off of the Beau Brummel products. I figured Beau Brummel and Mephistopheles would have a lot in common.^(5)
   * Top Notes – Lavender and Mandarin
   * Middle Notes – Black Pepper and Rose
   * Last Notes – Cedarwood, Vetiver, Vintage Leather & Tabac^(6), and Black Tea
* Thirteen – Leaning into her enjoyment of sweets, this is a fruity and sugary blend.
   * Top Notes – a blend called ‘Monkey Farts’, a mixture of pineapple, banana, orange, green apple, coconut, and vanilla.
   * Middle Notes – Almond Coconut milk, coffee, and almond biscotti
   * Last Notes – nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, lemon
* Raphael – Based a little bit off of Simeon’s scent but a little more citrusy with some scents of clean fabric and wood. This is the one I’m least certain about. Any suggestions would be welcome.
   * Top Notes – Lemon, Orange, Mint
   * Middle – Rosewood, Rose, Lily
   * Last – Sandalwood, Musk, Fresh Linen^(7), Woodshop^(8)

I’m also planning on making tallow deodorants to match but I’m out of tallow and arrowroot and have no desire to go to the grocery store just yet for supplies
