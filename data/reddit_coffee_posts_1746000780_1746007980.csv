I’ve been diving deep into personal development lately — reading (and listening to) tons of books focused on mindset, habits, self-growth, financial freedom, and overall becoming the best version of yourself. It's been life-changing, and it made me realize... I’d love to connect with others who are on a similar journey!

I'm hoping to start a Personal Growth Book Club right here in Jersey City.
A little about me — I’m 29yrs old woman, child-free, and looking to meet others who are excited about growing, learning, and building a positive community. Everyone is welcome, no matter your age, gender, or stage of life — but I will say that since my days off are midweek (Tuesday–Thursday), I’d love to meet people who have a little flexibility to meet up during the week sometimes!

Here’s the plan:

~ As a group, we'll pick a new book each month — focused on topics like mindset shifts, goal setting, abundance, financial literacy, health, personal empowerment, etc.

~ We’ll vote on which book to read first!

~ Everyone reads at their own pace, and then we meet up (maybe at a casual dinner spot, coffee shop, or a park) to discuss the book — and probably a lot more too!


A few example books/authors that match the vibe:

Atomic Habits by James Clear

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest

The 5AM Club by Robin Sharma

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* by Mark Manson

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

Anything from Mel Robbins, Jay Shetty, or similar authors.

We’ll stay connected through GroupMe, so if you’re interested, just join the chat here: https://groupme.com/join_group/107336858/QXBlOej5
Once a few people are in, we’ll vote on our first book and start planning our first meetup.

New books, new mindsets, new friendships — let's build something amazing together. See you then!",1,1746007946.0,Hoboken,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I had the most amount of chocolate that I’ve had since I started this decaf journey and here I am awake at 3:00 AM! I also feel a bit more anxious than the previous 9 days.

I’m 100% certain this is tied to chocolate. Here are the stats comparison to tea and coffee that I found:

Brewed Coffee…80–100 mg
Espresso (1 oz shot)…63 mg
Black Tea…40–70 mg
Green Tea…20–45 mg
Dark Chocolate (1 oz)…20–60 mg
Milk Chocolate (1 oz)…5–15 mg
White Chocolate…0 mg

Needless to say, no more chocolate for me!

I had a Skype plan for my Dad and me, we live in the UK and he moved over from the US. We both used to have a Skype call plan that gave us unlimited minutes to call US numbers for less than the price of a coffee monthly to keep in touch with relatives. Now that Skype has closed our monthly billing has stopped, and we can’t renew via the Skype dial pad website. 

With the switch to teams, it seems to be a nightmare a lot of people have been facing. In our case, it seems that calls is a separate plan in teams, that is geared towards corporate entities rather than individuals. 

Some of our relatives in the states don’t have computers so really I need to find a solution that lets us call similarly to how we did with Skype and isn’t going to break the bank charging by the minute. 

I have tried google voice but it says it hasn’t rolled out in the UK, so before I fumble around trying to figure out a replacement, I was wondering if anyone else had had the same issue. Thanks in advance. ",1,1746007773.0,skype,0,1.0,False

Okay, friends, let’s talk mornings! Are you like me, stumbling out of bed and immediately diving into your phone? 🙈 Or maybe your mornings often feel like a chaotic scramble, and then you sit down at your desk feeling like you’ve already run a marathon? 🏃‍♂️💨

Here’s the thing: mornings are like a blank canvas. You can paint it any way you want! 🎨 Recently, I made *one simple tweak* to my morning routine, and let me tell you—it's been a total game changer for my focus!

**Drum roll, please... 🥁 It’s all about the gratitude journal!** 

Now, before you roll your eyes and think “that’s cliché,” hear me out! Here’s how it really helped me:

- **Clears the Mental Clutter:** I used to wake up with 50 thoughts buzzing in my head. Scribbling down three things I’m grateful for? Instant mental declutter! It sets a positive tone and makes room for focus. 

- **Boosts Your Vibe:** There’s something magical about acknowledging the good things in your life first thing in the morning. Those few moments of positivity give me a little extra pep in my step. Who knew *writing* could feel like coffee for the soul? ☕️✨

- **Shapes the Day:** Once I’m grounded in gratitude, I can tackle my to-do list like a boss. It's like magic—suddenly, tasks that seemed daunting become mere casualties of my motivated mind. 🦸‍♀️

I mean, I know it sounds simple, but it’s honestly made such a *huge difference.* I find myself way more focused and present throughout the day. Plus, it just feels nice to start off on a positive note!

And don’t worry if journaling isn’t your jam. You do you! ✌️ Here are a few other tweaks I considered:

- **Swap scrolling for stretching:** Seriously, just **5 minutes of yoga** can wake you up more than doom-scrolling through social media. 
- **Plan your day the night before:** Nothing like waking up with your plan already in motion! 
- **Change up your wake-up time:** Even just 15 minutes earlier can give you that extra cushion to breathe.

So, what about you fellow MaximizeMe’ers? What’s that one little nugget of wisdom you’ve implemented that’s taken your focus to the next level? I’d love to soak up whatever golden magic you've discovered! 🌟",1,1746007584.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1kbcslz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kbcslz/super_duper_pregnant_and_i_hate_my_job/,Super duper pregnant and I hate my job,"I’m 28f and 33 weeks pregnant. I work remotely (I know, I know… I’m privileged and should probably be more grateful) and I got on maternity leave soon. I work in Human Resources so it’s not the most fun job, and not everyone likes you.. because.. well.. who actually likes HR? Literally nobody. However, there are some days it’s rewarding - like helping employees navigate difficult situations, succession planning, and the like.

However, within the past 6-9 months I’ve really noticed a decline in morale across the board. Our department has had such high turnover as well due to ineffective leadership. And while I’m on the topic of leadership, there’s so much nepotism and cliques it’s beginning to look really bad for the company. And there’s nothing I can do about it despite being in HR because.. well.. this is literally the VP of my department lol

And because of the high turnover lately, we have a lot of new eyes on our processes and they want to change literally everything. Granted I’m all for collaboration and improving processes, I genuinely believe we need it. However, these newcomers aren’t exactly being collaborative and are rudely demanding. Additionally, their wishes to get anything done/approved timely is incredibly naïve. Which isn’t their fault - they have high expectations of our company but leadership is slow moving.

So because we have all these newly hired people, including people on my team (me and 1 other girl are really only the OG workers that have been here for more than 5 years), everyone is coming at our team left and right because we’re everyone’s punching bags. We don’t have an HR manager, and our VP who we report to constantly takes the sides of everyone else. Which is very belittling and demeaning because no matter how I try to explain our current processes and why we do things the way we do, no one seems to fully comprehend our processes and because they don’t, they just resort to belittling our team behind our backs to our VP who then scolds us for not being “team players.”

The reason for my post is just to vent. Because as I’m writing this, I have trouble falling asleep, wake up in the middle of the night and can fall back asleep (it’s currently 5am right now and I’ve been up for 3 hours already). With the lack of sleep, stress from work, I’m also sick, my husband and I trying to get our home ready for our first baby, on top of car issues, falling behind on bills because medical bills are such a fun time.. everything just seems so overwhelming and I already feel like I’m failing as a new mom and baby girl isn’t even here yet :/

I know quitting my job isn’t an answer, and if I find another job the benefits might not be as good (right now I have 12 weeks full paid mat leave). So I’m really just trying to stick it out for now until leave starts, look for another job, and hope they have just as good benefits.. and hopefully a more well-rounded HR team.

Oh and I also have an investigation because someone decided to throw a hot cup of coffee towards someone in the office because they were “having a bad day.” And this guy refuses to talk to me because I could be too hormonal and pregnant to make a decision. And quite frankly, I’m starting to agree with him because I genuinely do not care about anything anymore besides what I need to do at home.

Idk how other women do it. Kudos to yall for being able to handle corporate nonsense, because I genuinely cannot take it anymore.

TLDR: I’m 33 weeks pregnant, feels like everyone in my department is ganging up on me and my team, our leadership doesn’t back our team up, high volume workload/high turnover, I hate my job but can’t leave quite yet until I can finish my maternity leave. Not sure if I have the patience.

Chapter 1  
  
In the third year of her marriage, her husband Alex Stone died on a mission.  
  
His twin brother, Jude Stone, returned with a bloodstained badge, his voice cracking as he said, ""Charlotte, Alex is... he's not coming back.""  
  
In extreme grief, she fainted on the spot.  
  
In the following months, she tried various suicide methods - taking sleeping pills, cutting her wrist, jumping into the river... but was saved every time.  
  
Everyone around is exclaiming, ""Mr. Stone and his wife were so devoted to each other...""  
  
Yes, they were.  
  
So devoted that it took her three months after his ""death"" to discover the truth—the man who died WASN'T her husband at all.  
  
...  
  
On the night when the third suicide attempt was saved, Charlotte dragged herself to her mother-in-law's house with a face pale as death, hoping to find some of Alex's old belongings to comfort her longing. But the conversation from inside the room chilled her to the bone.  
  
""Alex, how much longer are you going to keep up this charade? Charlotte has tried to kill herself three times for you!""  
  
Her fingers dug painfully into her palms.  
  
Alex? Why was her mother-in-law calling Jude by her husband's name?  
  
""Mom, just... give it time.."" The voice belonged to Jude, but the tender tone was more like Alex's—the gentleness he used when comforting her.  
  
""Jude made me promise with his dying breath to look after Violet. You know how fragile she is—hearing about Jude's death would definitely destroy her. So I had to step into my brother's shoes, to give her a child, something for her to live for.""  
  
Charlotte's blood turned to ice. She could hardly believe what she was hearing.  
  
So it was Alex's twin brother Jude who had died, not Alex.  
  
Her husband was still alive, but he was masquerading as his brother, sleeping in the next room—with his brother's wife!  
  
""But what about Charlotte?"" Her mother-in-law's voice grew more urgent. ""You're sharing Violet's bed without a second thought for your own wife?""  
  
""She's stronger than Violet...""  
  
The words hit like a knife to the ribs. Charlotte stumbled back, knocking over a broom.  
  
The room fell silent.  
  
Charlotte turned and ran as if pursued by demons.  
  
As she fled, she felt a sharp pain in her hand. Opening her palm, she discovered that she'd been clutching Alex's badge so tightly it had cut into her skin, blood trickling down her wrist.  
  
For three months, she'd slept with this badge pressed to her chest, waking up countless times with tears streaming down her face.  
  
Now? It was a goddamn joke.  
  
Her husband wasn't dead at all.  
  
He just chose to let her believe he was—all for the sake of his ""fragile"" sister-in-law!  
  
Five years earlier, Charlotte had met Alex at a military gala.  
  
He was the hard-as-nails Captain; she was a dancer with the Army Entertainment Corps.  
  
They both had their share of admirers, but that night, he stood at the foot of the stage, watching her dance with burning intensity. When she finished, he'd vaulted onto the stage and draped his dress coat over her bare shoulders.  
  
""Charlotte,"" he'd murmured, fingers brushing her collarbone. ""Take care of yourself. You'll catch cold.""  
  
Wrapped in his coat and his attention, she blushed with shyness.  
  
After that, he began pursuing her, always making a detour to see her before each mission.  
  
The day she agreed to be his girlfriend, he got spectacularly drunk and spun her around in circles in the courtyard, proclaiming, ""Charlotte, you're the only one for me. Forever.""  
  
After they married, everyone said Captain Stone adored his wife to the bone.  
  
She had believed he loved her more than life itself.  
  
But now?  
  
Now he was ""taking care"" of his brother's wife by pretending to be Jude, sharing Violet's bed, even planning to get her pregnant.  
  
And her? Like a fool, had cried for him, tried to die for him, suffered unbearable pain for him.  
  
Had he ever considered that she might be hurting too?  
  
When she made it home in a daze, Mrs. Wilson, the local matchmaker, was waiting for her again.  
  
""Charlotte, honey, Commander Hayes is being deployed to the island base in two weeks. This is the seventh time he's asked me to talk to you... He says if you don't agree this time, he's never coming back.""  
  
Ryan Hayes, Alex's fellow officer.  
  
Since the day she'd been declared a ""widow,"" he had repeatedly asked for her hand in marriage.  
  
She had refused him six times.  
  
Because she believed she would only ever love one man: Alex.  
  
But now...  
  
She looked up, her voice eerily calm. ""All right. I'll marry him.""  
  
Mrs. Wilson was stunned. ""You're... serious?""  
  
""Absolutely."" She managed a smile. ""Please tell Ryan that I'll marry him in two weeks and follow him to the island base.""  
  
The door slammed open. Alex—no, Jude now—loomed in the doorway, his face thunderous.   
  
""Charlotte. Who are you marrying?""  
  
Charlotte looked at him, finding the whole situation absurdly ironic.  
  
""Jude,"" she said softly, ""this is my business.""  
  
He gripped Charlotte's wrist with painful force. ""Charlotte has me to look after her. She doesn't need to remarry. Besides, she loved my brother too much to ever consider another man. Mrs. Wilson, please don't come here again. Otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!""  
  
Mrs. Wilson looked bewildered. ""But Charlotte already agreed—""  
  
Before she could finish, Charlotte tugged at her arm. ""Mrs. Wilson, didn't you say you needed to get to the store? You'd better hurry before it closes.""  
  
The distraction worked. Mrs. Wilson nodded and quickly left.  
  
Seeing her go, Alex visibly relaxed. He stepped closer, his Adam's apple bobbing. ""Charlotte, I know Alex is gone, but I promise I'll take care of you. The next time Mrs. Wilson come knocking, just send her away...""  
  
Heard of that, Charlotte only felt ridiculous.  
  
He spent his nights in Violet's bed but couldn't bear the thought of her remarriage? What kind of twisted logic was that?  
  
But she didn't expose him. She simply nodded.  
  
Anyway, in two weeks, she would marry Ryan and leave this place forever. Then Alex wouldn't be able to control her anymore.  
  
That night, as Charlotte was packing her belongings, she heard the unmistakable creaking of a bed from the adjacent room.  
  
Before, when she'd heard such sounds, she had simply assumed Jude and his wife had a healthy relationship.  
  
Now, each moan was like a blunt knife tearing at her flesh.  
  
That was unmistakably Alex's deep groan—the same sound he used to make in her ear when they made love.  
  
""Ahhh!""  
  
A scream pierced the night. Charlotte rushed out to see Alex carrying a half-dressed Violet toward the door, the alarming red stain in Violet's white pajama pants was unmistakable.  
  
The military housing complex instantly erupted with concerned neighbors. Mrs. Lee poked her head out from next door.  
  
""My goodness, what happened?""  
  
""I heard they were too rough during a sex and she even started bleeding...""  
  
""Tsk, tsk, tsk... Jude always seemed so serious, who knew he was so wild on the bed...""  
  
Standing amidst the crowd, Charlotte felt a chill spread through her body.  
  
She turned to leave, but Mrs. Lee grabbed her arm. ""Charlotte, you're family! You should go with them to the hospital!""  
  
To avoid gossip, she had no choice but to throw on a coat and follow them to the emergency room.  
  
In the hospital corridor, the sharp smell of antiseptic made Charlotte's eyes sting.  
  
Alex paced anxiously, clearly startled when he saw her.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
Charlotte forced a smile. ""As your family, I should be here.""  
  
Suddenly, the operating room doors swung open, and the doctor emerged.  
  
""Don't worry, sir. Your wife is fine—she's pregnant. You'll just need to be more careful with intimacy...""  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Charlotte stood in the hospital corridor as the doctor's words sent static buzzing through her head.  
  
""She's pregnant."" The news hit her like a sucker punch to the gut.  
  
Instinctively, she glanced at Alex, watching as his initial shock transformed into raw, unbridled joy, his voice dropping to a whisper: ""Thank God... everything's finally going to get back on track.""  
  
She knew exactly what he meant. Violet was pregnant. Now he could finally ditch his ""Jude"" charade and crawl back to her.  
  
But she has already no longer wanted him.  
  
""The patient's pretty anemic, though. She's going to need a blood transfusion,"" the doctor added, cutting through Charlotte's thoughts.  
  
Alex immediately rolled up his sleeve, but the doctor stopped him: ""Sorry, your blood type isn't compatible. We need Type B.""  
  
Charlotte happened to be Type B.  
  
His gaze turned to her, hesitating before he stepped closer. ""Charlotte, Violet's pregnant. This baby... we've been hoping for this.""  
  
He paused. ""Could you donate some blood for her? Once the baby is born, I will definitely make it up to you.""  
  
Make it up? Charlotte laughed bitterly inside.  
  
Was his idea of fixing things just waltzing back into her life like he was doing her some grand favor?  
  
""I'll donate the blood,"" she said evenly. ""But don't worry about make it up to me.""  
  
She turned and followed the nurse to the donation area.  
  
As the needle pierced her vein, she watched her bright red blood flow into the collection bag, suddenly remembering their first year of marriage when she'd come down with a brutal fever. Alex had carried her on his back for kilomiles to reach the hospital.  
  
That day, with a similar needle in her arm, he had gripped her hand tightly. ""Don't be scared, babe. I'm right here.""  
  
Now her blood would flow into another woman's body, nourishing their child.  
  
The weakness after the blood draw forced Charlotte to stay at home and recuperate for the next few days.  
  
Half lying on the bed, through her window, she watched Alex—he wasn't even reporting to base anymore—carrying a thermos back and forth between their house and the hospital every day.  
  
Chicken soup today, some special eggs tomorrow...  
  
Once upon a time, when she was bedridden with the flu, he'd creating different recipes to help her recover as well.  
  
Few days later, Violet was discharged, the entire military housing complex was filled with the sweet scent of caramel candies.  
  
Alex carried a jar of celebratory candy, distributing them door-to-door, his typically stern features softened by an undisguisable smile: ""Violet's pregnant. Let's share the joy. Have some candy.""  
  
""Congrats, man!""  
  
""Finally, the baby you've been waiting for!""  
  
He smiled and nodded, his entire face radiating the joy of impending fatherhood.  
  
Finally, he approached Charlotte, his hand hesitating as he offered her a candy. ""Charlotte...""  
  
""Congratulations,"" she took the candy, her smile perfectly calibrated. ""I wish your little family all the happiness in the world.""  
  
Alex's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.  
  
Her wishes were too perfect, too composed—composed enough to make his heart race with anxiety.  
  
Since ""Alex's death,"" Charlotte had been either sobbing or raging. When had she ever been this calm?  
  
Before he could dwell on it, Violet came over and linked her arm through his, her voice sugary sweet: ""Jude, didn't you say we'd take Charlotte out for dinner?""  
  
To thank Charlotte for the blood donation, Violet insisted on treating her to a meal.  
  
Despite her repeated refusals, Charlotte finally found herself in their car.  
  
At the restaurant, a waitress greeted them enthusiastically: ""Table for three? Right this way!""  
  
Her gaze moved between Alex and Violet, and she smiled. ""You two make such a cute couple!""  
  
Then she looked at Charlotte: ""Is this your sister? She's gorgeous.""  
  
Alex froze, but before he could respond, Charlotte had already answered pleasantly: ""Yes, I'm his sister.""  
  
Those words stabbed him like a knife to the heart.  
  
But looking at Violet's slightly swollen belly, he couldn't bring himself to correct her.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When ordering, Alex rattled off a list of dishes with practiced ease: ""No cilantro, light on oil and salt, extra spicy with a touch of sour...""  
  
All Violet's preferences.  
  
It wasn't until the waitress asked, ""And what would your sister like?"" that he seemed to remember Charlotte's presence, turning toward her with a startled expression.  
  
""I'm fine with anything,"" she said, lowering her face to sip her coffee, the steam clouding her features.  
  
After the food arrived, Charlotte mechanically ate the dishes.  
  
Then her throat suddenly tightened. She realized with horror that the pudding contained almond—  
  
She was allergic to almond!  
  
Once upon a time, Alex had memorized all her dietary restrictions. He would even specifically remind the cafeteria staff not to include almond in her meals.  
  
Now he had ordered pudding topped with almond without a second thought.  
  
""Charlotte?"" Violet noticed her changing complexion. ""Are you okay?""  
  
Alex finally looked up, and seeing her reddening face, jumped to his feet: ""Did you eat almond?!""  
  
Breathing became increasingly difficult. Charlotte's vision began to darken.  
  
Through the haze, she saw Alex rushing toward her, only to be stopped midway by Violet's cry of pain: ""Ah... my stomach hurts so much...""  
  
Time seemed to freeze in that moment.  
  
She watched Alex standing paralyzed, his gaze torn between her and Violet.  
  
Finally, he scooped Violet into his arms, hastily instructing the waitress as he left: ""Please get my sister to a hospital!""  
  
""Miss? Miss!"" The waitress's panicked calls grew fainter.  
  
And then Charlotte's consciousness slipped away completely.  
  
The sharp smell of antiseptic stung Charlotte's eyes as she opened them.  
  
She saw a nurse changing her IV bag.  
  
""You're awake!"" The nurse sighed with relief. ""Lucky the restaurant staff got you here in time. Anaphylactic shock can be deadly.""  
  
Charlotte tried to speak but found her throat burning with pain.  
  
The image of Alex unhesitatingly carrying Violet away refused to leave her mind.  
  
She closed her eyes, but tears still escaped, sliding from the corners of her eyes into her hair.  
  
For three days in the hospital, Charlotte lay alone in her bed. The allergic rash made her whole body itch, and her throat was so swollen she could barely swallow water.  
  
At her lowest point, she overheard nurses whispering outside her door:  
  
""That pregnant woman in 308 is just having some extra movement. Her husband's acting like it's the end of the world.""  
  
""Nothing like the patient in 302. Such a severe allergic reaction, and not once has her husband come to check on her. It's like he's already dead...""  
  
Charlotte buried her face in her pillow.  
  
Her husband was indeed already 'dead'.  
  
Dead in that mission, dead three months ago, dead... the moment he chose to become someone else's husband.  
  
On the day of her discharge, the sun was shining brightly.  
  
Charlotte had just reached the hospital entrance when she spotted the familiar olive-green Jeep.  
  
A moment later, Violet emerged from the hospital doors.  
  
The car door flew open with a bang, and Alex rushed over in a few quick strides, carefully supporting Violet's waist: ""Take it easy. The doctor said you need plenty of rest...""  
  
His voice was dripping with tenderness, exactly the same way he used to comfort her.  
  
Charlotte stood frozen in place, watching the Jeep drive away, its exhaust fumes blowing onto her pale face.  
  
He hadn't even spared her a single glance.  
  
Charlotte walked for so long that it was almost dark when she finally got home.  
  
As she approached, she spotted a tall figure standing by her front door from a distance.  
  
Alex was holding bags of nutritional supplements, with several more bags at his feet containing protein shakes, vitamin-infused honey, and canned soups.  
  
""Charlotte,"" he stepped quickly toward her. ""How's your allergy? Any better?""  
  
How ironic.  
  
Ignoring her completely during the day, then showing up alone to play the caring role.  
  
""Thanks for your concern. I'm much better,"" she said, trying to move past him.  
  
Alex grabbed her wrist: ""Take these to help you recover...""  
  
""No need—""  
  
""Jude! Holy shit—we're screwed!"" Violet suddenly burst into the yard, tears streaking her face. ""I've been reported for selling fake green cards to immigrants!""

1kbcrov,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kbcrov/trump_casino_pennystock_a_case_study/,Trump casino pennystock: A case study,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Donald Trump stormed into Atlantic City with a string of headline-making casinos—Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the crown jewel: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal.

It was built to dazzle—massive, opulent, and financed by high-interest junk bonds. The gamble was real. So were the stakes.

Within a year, the Taj Mahal went bankrupt.

Almost immediately, U.S. casino corporations like Caesars and Bally’s began circling the Atlantic City boardwalk like vultures.

While Trump scrambled to cover bond payments, corporate casinos like Caesars were locking in tax offsets, leveraging state connections, and securing Wall Street financing through their institutional backers.

The writing wasn’t on the wall—it had already been signed in corporate ink.

Those same corporations would eventually swallow Atlantic City—and Trump’s footprint along with it.

When the Taj Mahal finally closed in 2016, the workforce didn’t disappear.
The dealers stayed.
The waitstaff stayed.
The janitors stayed.

The only thing that changed?

Their pay got cut.
Their hours got worse.
And the name on the paycheck wasn’t local anymore.

It came from the U.S. corporate casinos—
not the boss down the hall,
but a fund manager in New York who never set foot in Atlantic City.

This wasn’t reinvestment.
It was recycling—at a discount.

Today, that same model plays out across the globe.

Starbucks didn’t win by brewing better coffee. It won by controlling corners. It planted itself across Manhattan, sometimes with two stores on the same block—not to serve more customers, but to freeze out any challenger. Dunkin’ gets the leftovers. Everyone else vanishes.

Walgreens gobbled up Duane Reade.
CVS finished off what was left of the independent pharmacies.

Once the field was cleared, corporate America jacked up prices and cut back manned hours. Prescriptions took longer. Help desks became kiosks. It wasn’t efficiency—it was extraction.

McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A? They’re not fast food chains anymore. They’re vertically integrated asset machines. They control the land under their stores, the supply chains that feed them, the franchise terms that govern them, and the national ad budgets that drown out competition.

They even control the financing that fuels expansion. If you’re not already inside the machine, you don’t get to challenge it. You’re expected to get out of the way.

And behind it all, the real power doesn’t wear logos or aprons. It operates from the top floors of BlackRock, Vanguard, and Apppolllo.

These asset managers and holding companies sit quietly behind every major brand that dominates your street. Caesars is controlled by Apollo Global. MGM is tied to Comcast and NBCUniversal. Penn Entertainment is held by BlackRock and Vanguard. Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Amazon—it doesn’t matter what name is out front. The same institutional overlords own slices of all of them. Same structure. Same dominance.

This isn’t a market. It’s a loop. A closed circuit of capital and consolidation. And once you’re outside of it, you don’t get back in.

And when someone threatens that loop—someone who knows exactly how it works because he once tried to beat it—the corporate media runs the same playbook as the monopolies.

They vilify.
They distort.
They manufacture outrage on command.

The same anchors who never lifted a finger when Main Street was gutted suddenly find their moral compass when the threat isn’t inequality—

it’s disruption of their sponsors.

Because let’s be clear: legacy media isn’t neutral. It’s just another division of the U.S. corporate machine.

And now Trump’s back—this time not to build casinos, but to break the monopoly that crushed him.

And they’re kicking and screaming.

Because they know it’s personal.
For him.
For the janitor.
For every American who got steamrolled by a U.S. corporation that valued stock charts over people.

What’s coming won’t be polite.
It won’t be easy.
And it won’t be pretty.

But if there’s anyone with the thick skin and raw drive to tear down the walls they’ve built around this rigged economy—it’s him.

And I can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Because maybe—just maybe—Americans will be free once again.
Free from the corporate monopoly that stole their paychecks, their towns, and their future.

Gorgeous. I mean really drop dead. We went for coffee a couple of hours and he was charming and lovely and very respectful and very Italian (we both are of Italian origin but were born and live in the UK). I left thinking he was lovely and I really liked him but that he was way out of my league. I was amazed and pleased when he contacted me and offered me his number, said he was leaving tinder and would I like to meet up again. We met again for a hike, for about 3 and a half hours. No intimacy. Other than a very European air kiss hello and goodbye. He then invited me to his home for dinner. I accepted. Again he was most respectful. He talked a lot about needing a connection, that he has to have special connections with his partner, that there were things he needed to share. It felt strange and very formal. At the end of the night as I was leaving he finally kissed me. It turned quite passionate and his whole body started shaking, I mean quite violently, not just trembling but literally shaking. I asked him if he was ok and he just said yes it was adrenaline!

I’m looking for advice on how to get started in commercial photography and land my first paying clients.

I’ve been doing photography on and off for over 10 years, mostly portraits. I wouldn’t say my work is amazing, but it’s definitely not terrible either. I genuinely love taking portraits and would like to turn this into something more than just a hobby.

I’ve tried reaching out to models on Instagram, Backstage, and similar platforms to offer TFP shoots, but haven’t had much luck. I think one issue is that I live in a smaller town in Scotland, and unfortunately, moving to a bigger city isn’t an option right now.

Recently, I bought a new camera and thought maybe it’s time to give photography another serious try. My current situation isn’t great—I’m stuck in a dead-end, minimum-wage job with terrible working conditions and no future prospects.

I also tried messaging local coffee shops and restaurants on Instagram, offering to take free photos in exchange for a tag or credit, but none of them responded—even though they usually shoot their content on phones.

I’ve started a new Instagram account where I post my latest work.

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. How did you get your first clients? What were your first steps into commercial photography?

Thanks in advance!

Coffee is such a mixed bag for me. On the ADHD side, I get the appeal — the quick boost in alertness, the sense of “something’s finally kicking my brain into gear.” Sometimes it helps me focus or get started on things I’ve been avoiding.

But with GAD? It’s chaos. My heart races, my chest gets tight, I feel jittery and overstimulated. It’s like my mind starts sprinting in 10 directions at once. And worst of all, if I’m already anxious or behind on sleep, caffeine just makes everything 10x worse.

I’ve found that small amounts (like half a cup) sometimes help, but only if I’m in a calm state to begin with. On high-anxiety days, coffee is a no-go — it just spirals me into overthinking and restlessness.

Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is trying to figure out where coffee fits into their routine. It’s not always a villain, but it’s definitely not always a friend either.

1kbclj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kbclj1/i_shouldnt_have_taken_that_shot/,I Shouldn’t Have Taken That Shot.,"I’ve hunted these woods since I was twelve.

Never had a reason to be scared out here. I know the ridgelines, the streams, the sound deer make when they crunch through the undergrowth. I know how a branch sounds when a squirrel hops across it. I know the silence when something bigger is nearby.

That silence is what tipped me off.

It was about an hour before dusk. Cold enough for my breath to hang. I was perched in my tree stand with the crossbow cradled across my lap, waiting on a buck I’d seen on my trail cam the night before—huge thing, with a scar down its neck and antlers like twisted roots.

But when it stepped into the clearing beneath me, something was off.

It was limping.

It moved like it didn’t know how to walk on legs. Kept tilting its head, too—like a dog trying to understand a noise. Then it looked up.

Not at the tree. At me.

Its eyes weren’t right. No reflection, no glint. Just pits. Sunken, too deep, too wide. I should’ve lowered the bow right then and there. Should’ve backed down and climbed out, left the woods and never looked back.

But I didn’t.

I fired.

The bolt struck it just under the ribcage. It didn’t bleed.

It didn’t flinch.

It just let out this low, wet sound, like air escaping a drowned lung. Then it dropped—legs buckling beneath it in this awkward collapse—and didn’t move.

I waited. Watched. Five minutes passed. Then ten.

No twitch. No sound. Nothing.

Finally, I climbed down.

It took everything in me to walk up to that thing. My boots crunched too loud in the dead leaves, my breath too sharp in my ears. The closer I got, the more I realized this wasn’t a deer.

It looked like one at first. But the proportions were off. Legs too long. Neck too thin. The fur had patches missing—revealing pale, blistered skin beneath. And its hooves… weren’t hooves.

They were hands.

Long, bony fingers curled under like they’d been broken and reset the wrong way. The flesh between them was webbed.

And the antlers? They weren’t antlers.

They were… bone. Gnarled, branching outward from the skull, yes—but they spiraled inward too, like the thing had been growing inward on itself. They twitched.

I turned and ran.

Didn’t even grab my bow. Just sprinted the three miles back to my truck, got in, locked the doors, and sat there shaking.

I told myself I imagined it. Shock, adrenaline, whatever. I just needed to get home, get warm, and sleep.

But something followed me.

It didn’t make sense until I got home and opened the door to my cabin.

Every light was on
.
I live alone.

I slammed the cabin door shut behind me and locked it. Deadbolt. Chain. Even slid the old dresser in front for good measure. I don’t even know why—I live miles from anyone. No one’s out here. No one’s supposed to be.

But I felt it.

Like something was still behind me.

I kept telling myself I was just shaken. That I’d seen a diseased buck, shot it in poor light, panicked. That none of it was as bad as it seemed. But that didn’t explain the lights being on.

I always shut them off before I leave. Habit. Out here, every bit of electricity counts.

I moved from room to room, checking the doors. Windows. Closets. Shower curtain.

Nothing.

No sign of a break-in. No footprints in the dust near the door. No scuffs on the floor. Just that same weird hum in the back of my skull—like the air was vibrating.

I turned off the lights, one by one. Didn’t want to draw attention to the house. Then I grabbed my rifle and sat on the couch with my back to the wall.

I don’t know when I nodded off, but I woke up cold.

It was pitch black. I could see my breath. The air felt… wet. Heavy, like I was breathing through a soaked rag. The fire had died to coals, and the windows had frosted over from the inside.

Then I heard it.

Knock.

Just one. Sharp. Low on the wall, maybe six inches off the floor.

I sat up straight, heart jackhammering. Listened.

Knock.

Same spot. Front of the cabin. Just under the living room window.

I turned on my flashlight, swept it across the wall. Nothing.

Another knock—this time behind me.

I spun around.

Knock knock knock.

Lower. Slower. From beneath the floorboards.

I aimed the flashlight down. The floor was just pine planks and dust, but I swear I saw one of them move. Just slightly. Like something pushed up from underneath and the wood bowed, just for a second.

I didn’t breathe.

Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock.

Now at the back of the house. Then the hallway. Then the base of the kitchen sink.

It was circling. Under me.

And then it stopped.

I waited. Minutes passed. No sound. No movement.

I got up, tried to calm myself, and padded toward the hallway.

That’s when I heard my voice.

Not a voice. My voice.

From under the floorboards.

Whispering.

I must’ve passed out again.

When I opened my eyes, the sun was bleeding pale light through the frosted windows. My back ached from sleeping on the floor, the rifle still clutched in my hands.

For a moment, I thought I’d dreamed it all.

The knocks. The whisper. The voice.

Then I looked at the window.

Four long, vertical scratches carved into the glass from the inside—as if something had been trying to claw its way out.

And below them, just visible in the frost on the floorboards, was a handprint.

It wasn’t human.

Too wide. Too many fingers. The imprint stretched out like something had melted into the wood, leaving behind an oily residue that shimmered faintly in the light.

I reached out. Touched it.

Still damp.

I don’t know what compelled me to lift the edge of the bedspread, but I did.

There was nothing under the bed.

Except for another handprint.

And a drag mark leading toward the hallway.

That’s when the air changed again.

Still. Heavy. Like the world was holding its breath.

Then something slammed into the front door.

BOOM.

I jolted, stumbled back into the wall, rifle up.

BOOM.

The whole frame shook. Dust rained from the ceiling. The chain lock rattled like a scared animal.

Then silence.

I crept toward the door, breath caught in my throat, every step slower than the last.

The third hit didn’t come like the others.

This time, it was low. Like something had dropped onto all fours and was pushing its head against the bottom half of the door.

The wood began to bend inward, creaking under pressure it shouldn’t have been able to take.

I raised the rifle.

Something spoke through the crack in the door.

Not words. Just… a mimicry of breathing. Like someone trying to sound human. Drawing in air and letting it rattle out again. Wet. Croaking. Like a throat filled with fluid.

Then it laughed.

My laugh.

Perfectly replicated. Just a little too loud. Just a little too long.

Then came the whisper—again in my voice—from beneath the floor.

“Let me in. I’m cold.”

I backed away, trying not to scream, trying to remember if I left the back door locked, if the windows were shut, if—

The rifle jammed.

I don’t even remember pulling the trigger. Just the sound of the click and the sickening realization that I’d never cleaned the chamber.

The door creaked again.

Slow. Splintering.

Something thin was beginning to poke through the crack where the wood split—not a hand. Not a claw.

Something bonier. Jointed wrong. Like a centipede made of fingers.

I didn’t waste time trying the rifle again.

Instead, I shoved the couch toward the front door with all the force I had. Threw the kitchen table against it. Dragged the bookcase from the hallway and tipped it over. I even knocked over the coat rack and wedged it under the door handle like some kind of medieval brace.

Something on the other side scraped along the wood. Slow. Purposeful. Like nails—or teeth.

I backed away and ran to the radio.

It’s old, military-grade—set to pick up emergency channels. I’d rigged it with a signal booster last winter when the snows had made it impossible to get out for days. It should’ve worked.

I spun the dial. Static.

Clicked through the presets. Static.

Then something came through.

Not a voice. Not at first.

Breathing.

Then a rustle. Then my voice—recorded.

But it was something I’d never said.

“Don’t shoot,” it said in a panicked whisper. “It just wants a way in. Let it in. Let it in.”

I dropped the receiver like it burned me.

Another station buzzed to life.

It was me again. Same voice. Same tone.

Only now I sounded calm. Pleasant.

“I was cold,” I said. “But it’s warm inside. You’ll see.”

I shut the radio off. Yanked the battery out. Threw it across the room.

The thing at the door didn’t like that.

It slammed against the frame again, harder this time—splinters rained down from the edges. The couch jolted. The table legs skidded across the floor with a shriek.

I ran to the back door. Still locked.

I pulled a heavy dresser in front of it. Nailed shut the windows I could reach. Taped over the vents. Shut the flue in the chimney and pushed the coffee table against it.

Then I stood in the center of the room, panting, heart thudding in my ears.

The house went quiet again.

And that was worse.

I don’t know how long I stood there. Ten minutes. Maybe an hour.

Then came the tapping.

Not from the door.

From the window.

I turned, slow.

Something was standing just beyond the frost-glazed glass. Thin. Wrong. Its head tilted at an unnatural angle, its too-long limbs twitching at the joints like they didn’t know where to bend.

It didn’t move.

Just tapped.

One finger.

Then another.

Then it opened its mouth, wide and wet, and pressed it to the glass.

And whispered my name.

I’m posting this now because I don’t know how long the power will stay on. If anyone’s out there—if anyone’s reading this—please send help.

I don’t think it’s trying to kill me.

I think it’s trying to replace me.

1kbcka7,https://i.redd.it/k3ff8d542yxe1.jpeg,Case Study: How Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Became a Penny Stock,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Donald Trump stormed into Atlantic City with a string of headline-making casinos—Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the crown jewel: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal.

It was built to dazzle—massive, opulent, and financed by high-interest junk bonds. The gamble was real. So were the stakes.

Within a year, the Taj Mahal went bankrupt.

Almost immediately, U.S. casino corporations like Caesars and Bally’s began circling the Atlantic City boardwalk like vultures.

While Trump scrambled to cover bond payments, corporate casinos like Caesars were locking in tax offsets, leveraging state connections, and securing Wall Street financing through their institutional backers.

The writing wasn’t on the wall—it had already been signed in corporate ink.

Those same corporations would eventually swallow Atlantic City—and Trump’s footprint along with it.

When the Taj Mahal finally closed in 2016, the workforce didn’t disappear.
The dealers stayed.
The waitstaff stayed.
The janitors stayed.

The only thing that changed?

Their pay got cut.
Their hours got worse.
And the name on the paycheck wasn’t local anymore.

It came from the U.S. corporate casinos—
not the boss down the hall,
but a fund manager in New York who never set foot in Atlantic City.

This wasn’t reinvestment.
It was recycling—at a discount.

Today, that same model plays out across the globe.

Starbucks didn’t win by brewing better coffee. It won by controlling corners. It planted itself across Manhattan, sometimes with two stores on the same block—not to serve more customers, but to freeze out any challenger. Dunkin’ gets the leftovers. Everyone else vanishes.

Walgreens gobbled up Duane Reade.
CVS finished off what was left of the independent pharmacies.

Once the field was cleared, corporate America jacked up prices and cut back manned hours. Prescriptions took longer. Help desks became kiosks. It wasn’t efficiency—it was extraction.

McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A? They’re not fast food chains anymore. They’re vertically integrated asset machines. They control the land under their stores, the supply chains that feed them, the franchise terms that govern them, and the national ad budgets that drown out competition.

They even control the financing that fuels expansion. If you’re not already inside the machine, you don’t get to challenge it. You’re expected to get out of the way.

And behind it all, the real power doesn’t wear logos or aprons. It operates from the top floors of BlackRock, Vanguard, and Apollo.

These asset managers and holding companies sit quietly behind every major brand that dominates your street. Caesars is controlled by Apollo Global. MGM is tied to Comcast and NBCUniversal. Penn Entertainment is held by BlackRock and Vanguard. Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Amazon—it doesn’t matter what name is out front. The same institutional overlords own slices of all of them. Same structure. Same dominance.

This isn’t a market. It’s a loop. A closed circuit of capital and consolidation. And once you’re outside of it, you don’t get back in.

And when someone threatens that loop—someone who knows exactly how it works because he once tried to beat it—the corporate media runs the same playbook as the monopolies.

They vilify.
They distort.
They manufacture outrage on command.

The same anchors who never lifted a finger when Main Street was gutted suddenly find their moral compass when the threat isn’t inequality—

it’s disruption of their sponsors.

Because let’s be clear: legacy media isn’t neutral. It’s just another division of the U.S. corporate machine.

And now Trump’s back—this time not to build casinos, but to break the monopoly that crushed him.

And they’re kicking and screaming.

Because they know it’s personal.
For him.
For the janitor.
For every American who got steamrolled by a U.S. corporation that valued stock charts over people.

What’s coming won’t be polite.
It won’t be easy.
And it won’t be pretty.

But if there’s anyone with the thick skin and raw drive to tear down the walls they’ve built around this rigged economy—it’s him.

And I can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Because maybe—just maybe—Americans will be free once again.
Free from the corporate monopoly that stole their paychecks, their towns, and their future.

1kbcgmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/1kbcgmb/for_what_its_worth/,For what it's worth...,"I've been talking to a lot of even casual cis acquaintances and literally everybody, **without exception**, is now fucking disgusted with the SC ruling.

I've been talking to literally everybody I know, most of whom I don't really even know that well. The people working at the coffee shops I go to. The people who work at train stations. The people who go to my ballet classes. People at work. You name it. And I'm going to keep talking to people with every ounce of strength.

Probably 70+ people now in two weeks, most of them I only know casually, who have almost all agreed to write to their MPs about it, and to mention it to their family and friends.

Even my mother has also been taking up a lot of activism over this, in person and online. She's a lot more sociable than I, so she's so far managed to reach out to about 200+ direct acquaintances who are all similarly outraged and engaged on our side.

Some of them were a bit clueless at first as to what the SC ruling meant for us, but bringing them up to speed with how it affects us doesn't take long, and when they're up to speed, they've all been fucking furious with it all. 

The only notable exception has been a lady at my ballet class who I had been friendly with before. She started off on Monday being mildly transphobic in her views. I don't think she's a full on GC, but she was coming out with occasional GC talking points and dog whistles - even going so far as to say that she completely agreed with the SC ruling because ""it brings clarity"".
But after we had a 45 minute conversation after class where we got to know each other a bit better and I explained the situation and the harm this SC ruling does to us and even cis women, she realised that the SC has done exactly the opposite to clarity, and that it only really seems to exist to harm trans people. 
I don't think I have completely changed her mind on trans rights, and I'm sure we will still disagree on a lot of stuff, but it didn't take much to get her to realise that the SC ruling was unnecessary and intentionally harmful towards people like us, and ultimately said she would write to her MP too in opposition to the ruling.

The point I'm trying to make it that while it might not feel like it, I genuinely think have **far** more support than we realise. While I'm sure there are some hard-core transphobic nutters out there who would happily hurt themselves a lot if it meant hurting trans people even a little bit, basically everybody I'm talking to in-person are actually normal people who know it's wrong and are vehemently opposed to what's happening - they just don't know how to help - so I'm telling them how they can do that. 

While I'm not going to in any way judge anybody for not doing this, I would encourage anybody who is in a position physically and/or emotionally to start talking to people and spreading the word on an individual basis.

So about a month ago I was working when I got a call down from a room complaining about some loud noises and bangs, the guy on the phone said she didn't have all her ""nuts and bolts"" so to speak, I said ""it's alright, I'll go check it out for you"" from there I go up and the deadbolt is holding the door open I cautiously peeked inside to see what was goin on but she was just simply packing and had hearing problems since she was older, I decided to help her out so she didn't make any more noise and disrupt half the building, but that's not it yet, she had this SUPER foul smell coming off of her and it looked like her face had some sort of gunk or infection all over, ofc I didn't say anything and just went on as usual.

She then later comes down and just starts staring me up and down with this creepy ass smile on her face and then she started taking pictures of the TV in the lobby saying sum like ""people are out to get me"" or sum along those lines, she would randomly walk out to the front canopy and just stare into space for 5mins then come back in and take more pictures of TV, all in all some really creepy vibes.

Then there's today, where I see her again and ofc she's right back at her typically weirdo shit we're talking drinking a cup of coffee creamer, walking into the employee room, sticking her fingers in the breakfast and not to mention her attempting to steal the fucking hotel phone as I was ringing up a tub of ice cream for her, this lady genuinely freaks me tf out also something of note; the housekeepers found her sheets and blankets in her goddamn refrigerator.

I'm not entirely sure if this fits the criteria of this sub reddit but I have to say this lady has shook me to my core, it's like seeing a ghost in real life I haven't been that creeped out literally ever.",2,1746005994.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

- lack of bins (saying that obviously no one needs one as the place is so clean)
- metro and train system can be confusing (especially for novices like us
- tourists, holy smokes it certainly is overcrowded. Japan should put a curb on tourism
- it’s fairly expensive 
- difficult to find a great coffee place

I'm doing too many late shifts right now which often end at 10:30-11:00 PM, sometimes later. I may get home as early as 11-12 but struggle to fall asleep until 2-3 AM.

I have no trouble sleeping otherwise but I really really struggle to fall asleep after a late shift. And it's affecting my off days a lot more than my working days which sucks.

Sometimes I'm using sleeping pills, when I'm out of sleeping pills I'm abusing things like tizanidine etc. I sleep like a baby on my days off though, which is a good sign I assume.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Functional Beverages and Their Rising Popularity

Functional beverages are drinks that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. Unlike traditional beverages, which mainly hydrate or satisfy thirst, these drinks contain ingredients that promote overall wellness, support mental clarity, boost energy, or aid digestion. As concerns about health and lifestyle grow, many people look for alternatives to coffee that still offer an energy lift but with added nutrients and fewer side effects.

Coffee, while beloved worldwide, can sometimes lead to jitters, crashes, or digestive issues due to its caffeine content and acidity. Enter functional beverages—a healthier alternative that balances energy support with wellness benefits. These drinks often include adaptogens, antioxidants, vitamins, and natural plant extracts that help your body handle stress, improve focus, and maintain steady energy levels.

### Common Ingredients Found in Healthier Coffee Alternatives

One key to the success of functional beverages lies in their carefully selected ingredients. Here are some popular components often found in these drinks:

- **Adaptogens:** Herbs like ashwagandha, rhodiola, and ginseng help your body adapt to stress and maintain balance.
- **Mushroom Extracts:** Varieties such as reishi, lion’s mane, and cordyceps support immunity, brain health, and stamina.
- **Antioxidants:** Ingredients like green tea, turmeric, and acai berries help fight free radicals and reduce inflammation.
- **Natural Caffeine Sources:** Guarana and yerba mate offer smoother energy without the typical coffee crash.
- **Functional Fibers and Prebiotics:** These support gut health, enhancing digestion and nutrient absorption.

By combining these ingredients, functional beverages provide not just a caffeine boost, but also a broad spectrum of health benefits, making them excellent coffee substitutes.

### Popular Varieties of Functional Beverages to Try

There are plenty of options if you want to swap your coffee routine for something that’s better for your body. Here are some trending functional beverages you can explore:

#### Mushroom Coffee

Unlike traditional coffee, mushroom coffee blends real coffee grounds with mushroom extracts such as lion’s mane or chaga. This beverage retains the comforting aroma of coffee but reduces acidity and introduces cognitive support and immune-boosting properties. If you still crave the taste of coffee but want a gentler option, this is a great start.

#### Herbal Adaptogen Teas

Teas featuring adaptogens like ashwagandha or holy basil (tulsi) help combat fatigue and enhance mental clarity. They’re naturally caffeine-free or contain minimal caffeine, making them ideal for those sensitive to stimulants or seeking a calming but energizing drink.

#### Yerba Mate

A traditional South American beverage, yerba mate contains natural caffeine along with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It provides sustained alertness without the spikes and dips associated with coffee, making it a smoother energizer for your day.

#### Golden Milk

This warm beverage usually combines turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, and a milk base (dairy or plant-based). Rich in anti-inflammatory properties, golden milk offers calming effects and gentle energy, perfect for a morning boost or a soothing bedtime ritual.

#### Functional Energy Waters

These are enhanced waters infused with vitamins, electrolytes, or botanicals like ginseng or green tea extract. Functional energy waters hydrate and rejuvenate without the heaviness or acidity of coffee.

### Health Benefits Beyond Caffeine

Switching to functional beverages can offer advantages that go way beyond just swapping out your caffeine source:

- **Steady Energy Levels:** The caffeine in these drinks is often combined with other compounds that slow absorption. This means no sharp crashes or jitters.
- **Improved Mental Focus:** Ingredients like lion’s mane mushroom support concentration and cognitive function.
- **Reduced Inflammation:** Many functional beverages contain anti-inflammatory herbs, which can ease chronic pain or stress on the body.
- **Better Gut Health:** The inclusion of prebiotics and digestive aids helps improve your microbiome for overall wellness.
- **Stress Reduction:** Adaptogens balance the body’s response to stress hormones, helping you feel calmer and more grounded.

These benefits make functional beverages a wise choice for anyone looking to enhance their health while still enjoying a ritualistic, flavorful drink.

1. **Start Slow:** Begin by replacing one cup of coffee a day with a functional beverage to give your body time to adjust.
2. **Experiment with Flavors:** Explore blends with different herbs and adaptogens to find what suits your taste and lifestyle best.

With time, you might find that these alternatives offer a cleaner, more balanced boost than coffee ever did.

1kbcbh3,https://i.redd.it/yifq4eyxyxxe1.jpeg,"How Trump Hotels became penny stock, A case study","In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Donald Trump stormed into Atlantic City with a string of headline-making casinos—Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the crown jewel: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal.

It was built to dazzle—massive, opulent, and financed by high-interest junk bonds. The gamble was real. So were the stakes.

Within a year, the Taj Mahal went bankrupt.

Almost immediately, U.S. casino corporations like Caesars and Bally’s began circling the Atlantic City boardwalk like vultures.

While Trump scrambled to cover bond payments, corporate casinos like Caesars were locking in tax offsets, leveraging state connections, and securing Wall Street financing through their institutional backers.

The writing wasn’t on the wall—it had already been signed in corporate ink.

Those same corporations would eventually swallow Atlantic City—and Trump’s footprint along with it.

When the Taj Mahal finally closed in 2016, the workforce didn’t disappear.
The dealers stayed.
The waitstaff stayed.
The janitors stayed.

The only thing that changed?

Their pay got cut.
Their hours got worse.
And the name on the paycheck wasn’t local anymore.

It came from the U.S. corporate casinos—
not the boss down the hall,
but a fund manager in New York who never set foot in Atlantic City.

This wasn’t reinvestment.
It was recycling—at a discount.

Today, that same model plays out across the globe.

Starbucks didn’t win by brewing better coffee. It won by controlling corners. It planted itself across Manhattan, sometimes with two stores on the same block—not to serve more customers, but to freeze out any challenger. Dunkin’ gets the leftovers. Everyone else vanishes.

Walgreens gobbled up Duane Reade.
CVS finished off what was left of the independent pharmacies.

Once the field was cleared, corporate America jacked up prices and cut back manned hours. Prescriptions took longer. Help desks became kiosks. It wasn’t efficiency—it was extraction.

McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A? They’re not fast food chains anymore. They’re vertically integrated asset machines. They control the land under their stores, the supply chains that feed them, the franchise terms that govern them, and the national ad budgets that drown out competition.

They even control the financing that fuels expansion. If you’re not already inside the machine, you don’t get to challenge it. You’re expected to get out of the way.

And behind it all, the real power doesn’t wear logos or aprons. It operates from the top floors of BlackRock, Vanguard, and Apollo.

These asset managers and holding companies sit quietly behind every major brand that dominates your street. Caesars is controlled by Apollo Global. MGM is tied to Comcast and NBCUniversal. Penn Entertainment is held by BlackRock and Vanguard. Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Amazon—it doesn’t matter what name is out front. The same institutional overlords own slices of all of them. Same structure. Same dominance.

This isn’t a market. It’s a loop. A closed circuit of capital and consolidation. And once you’re outside of it, you don’t get back in.

And when someone threatens that loop—someone who knows exactly how it works because he once tried to beat it—the corporate media runs the same playbook as the monopolies.

They vilify.
They distort.
They manufacture outrage on command.

The same anchors who never lifted a finger when Main Street was gutted suddenly find their moral compass when the threat isn’t inequality—

it’s disruption of their sponsors.

Because let’s be clear: legacy media isn’t neutral. It’s just another division of the U.S. corporate machine.

And now Trump’s back—this time not to build casinos, but to break the monopoly that crushed him.

And they’re kicking and screaming.

Because they know it’s personal.
For him.
For the janitor.
For every American who got steamrolled by a U.S. corporation that valued stock charts over people.

What’s coming won’t be polite.
It won’t be easy.
And it won’t be pretty.

But if there’s anyone with the thick skin and raw drive to tear down the walls they’ve built around this rigged economy—it’s him.

And I can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Because maybe—just maybe—Americans will be free once again.
Free from the corporate monopoly that stole their paychecks, their towns, and their future.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

selecting the correct 8 oz cup requires considering individual priorities concerning environmental impact, convenience, and the intended use case.

I don’t mean acquaintances or people you can grab coffee with once in a while. I’m talking about the kind of friendships where you can send unhinged messages at 2am or just sit in silence without it being weird. That kind of deep bond feels so rare these days.

When I was younger, friendships seemed easier and less complicated, less fragile. Now that I’m older everything feels more… delicate? Like one wrong move, one misinterpreted text, and the connection just drifts. Some girls already have their circle from school or uni and aren’t really open to adding new people. Others seem nice but only keep things surface level, like you’re always hovering on the edge of being part of their friend circle.

There’s also this quiet fear I carry of being too clingy, too distant, too intense, too boring. It’s like I’m constantly measuring myself and how I’m showing up in the friendship, afraid I’ll somehow mess it up or be seen as weird. And honestly, sometimes it feels like other women are sizing you up before deciding if you’re friend material. Like there’s this invisible competition we didn’t sign up for. It sucks, because I know deep down we all crave connection. We’re just scared to be the one who wants it more.

And maybe this is niche, but I’ve also struggled to find other girls who like playing video games, not just casually, but actually into it. I play games like Apex, CS, League and sometimes it feels like most of the girls I meet either aren’t into gaming at all or just play things like Valorant for fun or bc of their friends, which is totally fine and I do enjoy playing with them, but I’m craving someone who’s just as hyped about playing, grinding and improving and actually enjoy the high adrenaline boost you get from playing the game. I want that chaotic, shouty duo energy with another girl who gets it.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The following 5-cup coffee machines offer several noteworthy features that contribute to their overall performance and user experience.

**Brew Strength Control:** Offers different brewing options like regular and bold for customized flavor profiles.

Brew strength control is an essential feature for coffee lovers who prefer a certain strength in their coffee. A good coffee machine will provide the ability to adjust the brewing parameters to meet individual preferences. For example, some 5-cup coffee machines allow you to slow down the brewing process, allowing the water to extract more flavor from the coffee grounds.

**Programmable Timer:** Enables users to set a specific time for the coffee machine to automatically start brewing.

A programmable timer allows users to wake up to freshly brewed coffee every morning, or to have a pot ready after work. This is a very useful feature for busy individuals who want to save time and effort. Setting up the timer is usually very easy, involving setting the current time and then the desired brewing time. The machine will then take care of the rest, ensuring a hot pot of coffee is ready when you need it.

**Automatic Shut-Off:** Automatically turns the coffee machine off after a period of inactivity, enhancing safety and energy efficiency.

An automatic shut-off feature is a must-have safety feature in modern coffee machines. It automatically turns the machine off after a specific period of inactivity, usually ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours. This feature prevents the machine from overheating and potentially causing a fire if accidentally left on. This also helps save energy, especially if you tend to forget to turn appliances off after use.

**Compact Design:** Designed to fit comfortably on countertops with limited space.

A compact design is a key feature of 5-cup coffee machines, as they are primarily targeted towards individuals and small households with limited counter space. The machine is designed to be small and unobtrusive. This is especially beneficial for apartment dwellers or anyone with a small kitchen. The compact design also makes the machine easy to store when not in use.

Key features of the best 5-cup coffee machines include:

*   Adjustable Brew Strength
*   Programmable Functionality
*   Automatic Shut-Off
*   Compact and Efficient Design

 ## Core Benefits

The top 5-cup coffee machines offer several key benefits that make them an attractive choice for coffee lovers.

**Saves Counter Space:** The compact size of these machines makes them ideal for small kitchens or limited counter space.

5-cup coffee machines save significant counter space compared to their larger counterparts. For those with limited kitchen areas, this can make a big difference in overall functionality. Instead of dominating the counter, the compact coffee machine blends in and saves more room for food preparation.

**Cost-Effective Brewing:** Brew only the amount of coffee you need, reducing waste and saving money on coffee grounds.

Brewing smaller amounts of coffee reduces the amount of wasted coffee. Often, larger coffee machines will brew more than you can drink, leading to leftover coffee that gets thrown away. The 5-cup coffee machine helps to save money on coffee grounds, making it more economical.

**Perfect for Small Households:** These machines are specifically designed to brew enough coffee for one to two people, making them ideal for singles, couples, or small families.

For small households, brewing a full pot of coffee in a larger machine is often unnecessary, leading to wasted coffee. A 5-cup coffee machine is perfectly sized to provide just the right amount of coffee for one or two people, reducing waste and ensuring that you always have a fresh pot. This also allows you to tailor your coffee consumption to your actual needs.

 ## FAQs Section

The following are some frequently asked questions about 5-cup coffee machines.

**What type of coffee filter does a 5-cup coffee machine use?**

Most 5-cup coffee machines use a standard #2 cone-shaped paper filter. Some models may come with a reusable filter, which is a more eco-friendly option. Always refer to the user manual for specific filter recommendations for your machine.

**How often should I clean my 5-cup coffee machine?**

It's recommended to clean your coffee machine at least once a month, or more frequently if you use it daily. Mineral deposits from hard water can build up and affect the taste of your coffee and the performance of your machine. You can use a commercial coffee machine cleaner or a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water.

**Can I use a 5-cup coffee machine to make tea?**

While it's technically possible to use a coffee machine to make tea, it's not recommended. Coffee residue can affect the taste of the tea, and tea leaves can clog the machine. It's best to use a separate tea kettle or tea maker for brewing tea.

1kbc6v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1kbc6v5/i_read_the_wrong_mind/,I Read the Wrong Mind,"
Guys, I have to write this down, right now. I don't know if I'll finish, I don't know who will even believe me, but I have to try. Someone needs to know. My name is Adam, just a regular young guy like anyone else here in Cairo, maybe the only difference is… I have a gift? A curse? I don't know what to call it. I can hear people's thoughts. Yes, exactly like that. I read what's inside their heads.

It started when I was a kid. I thought they were hallucinations at first, voices inside my head that weren't mine. With time, I understood I was hearing the thoughts of those around me. It was terrifying initially, then it became amusing, then… an addiction. You can't imagine the amount of nonsense, drama, and crazy daydreams swirling in people's minds while you're just walking down the street or riding the metro. I used to entertain myself with them – finding out who hated their boss, who was cheating on their spouse, who was sick of their life, who was planning to skip work. I felt like a superhero sometimes, or maybe a little devil, eavesdropping on their deepest secrets with nobody the wiser. It gave me a sense of power, of being special… a feeling that I was different, that I saw the truth behind people's masks.

I was addicted to that feeling. I reached a point where I couldn't interact with anyone without taking a ""peek"" inside their head first. Know their intentions, know what they really thought of me. I started judging people based on their thoughts, not their words or actions. Sometimes I'd discover incredibly kind souls hidden inside, other times I'd crash into an indescribable amount of malice, spite, and hatred concealed behind fake smiles. It was like the internet, a vast ocean full of good and bad, but I focused more on the bad – it was more entertaining, more dramatic.

I know it's wrong. I know it's rude and a violation of privacy, but I couldn't resist. Like someone who discovers they can open any locked door – naturally, they'll try every door. I felt like the director watching the backstage chaos of life's daily play. Sometimes I used it to my advantage – figuring out what the professor would focus on in an exam, finding out if the girl I liked thought about me (which usually ended in disappointment), knowing if someone was trying to cheat me in a deal. But mostly, I used it for pure amusement. Like scrolling through Facebook and seeing people's scandals and problems, I did that live, directly from the source.

About a month ago, I started feeling a bit bored. All the thoughts became repetitive – same worries, same problems, same trivialities. I felt like someone watching the same movie every day. Until I met him.

I was at the Sadat metro station, crowded as usual, the air thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and cigarette smoke. While waiting for the train, I noticed a man standing a bit off to the side, alone. He looked completely ordinary, maybe a bit rugged. Worn-out jeans, a faded t-shirt, sharp, typically Egyptian features, but nothing particularly attention-grabbing. Maybe late thirties, early forties. He wasn't doing anything special, just standing there, looking towards the tunnel where the train arrives, like everyone else. But there was something strange about him, an aura of calm and intense focus amidst all the noise. People around him were shouting, talking, laughing, and he was completely oblivious, like he was in another world.

Curiosity killed me, as usual. I thought I'd just ""take a look,"" see what this guy was thinking about. I focused on him, like I always do, like aiming a satellite dish to receive a specific channel. And in an instant, I was inside his head.

Oh my God.

The voice I heard inside my mind wasn't like any voice I'd heard before. There were no worries about work or problems at home or idle daydreams. There was… sharp focus, like a laser beam. And images. Images flashing by with terrifying speed. A dark alleyway. Hurried footsteps. Short, ragged breaths. Then… a muffled scream. Blood. So much blood.

I flinched, taking a step back. My heart was pounding. What was that? What did I just hear? I tried again, more cautiously this time.

The thoughts were clearer… and more horrifying. ""Have to find him tonight… won't escape me again… must finish him… this filth needs to be cleaned up… his rotten stench fills the place… but where?… must focus…"". These words repeated like a broken record, mixed with images of bloody violence, distorted faces, disgusting things I couldn't quite identify. But the constant theme was the determination to ""cleanse,"" to ""get rid of"" something or someone he described with the foulest terms.

The train arrived, people pushed forward as usual. I saw him move calmly and board the train. A shiver ran down my spine. This man wasn't normal. These weren't the thoughts of an ordinary person. These were the thoughts of… a killer. Maybe a serial killer? The idea made my stomach churn. For the first time since discovering my ""gift,"" I felt real fear. Fear not just for myself, but fear of what this man might do.

I got on the same train, standing a little distance away, but keeping my eyes on him. Every few minutes, I'd ""peek"" into his mind again. Same bloody thoughts, same terrifying focus. He was like a predator stalking its prey. Who was his prey? And why did he want to kill them so brutally?

""I have to watch him."" That was the decision I made right then. A strange sense of responsibility suddenly fell upon me. I was the only one who knew what this man was thinking. I was the only one who could possibly stop him. Part of me was terrified and wanted to run as far away as possible, but the larger part – the curious part addicted to thrills, and the part that suddenly felt like a hero – was determined to see this through.

He got off at a station near downtown, and I followed him. He walked through side streets, his steps quick and steady. I followed cautiously, trying not to be noticed. He entered a small, dingy local cafe, sitting at a table in a dark corner by himself. I ordered something to drink and sat further away, pretending to read something on my phone, but all my focus was on him.

I entered his mind again. The thoughts were a bit calmer now, but still held the same intensity. ""Getting closer… I can feel him… in this area… must be patient… he'll show up… has to show up to feed… hunger will expose him…"". Feed? Feed on what? Or who? This talk was amplifying my terror. This man was definitely dangerously insane.

I continued to watch him over the following days. It turned into an obsession. I started skipping college, lying to my family, just so I could follow him. He moved around a lot, different areas in Cairo, always alone, always with the same deadly focus. I found out his name was ""Aziz"" – or at least, that's the name I heard someone call him once when he was buying something from a kiosk. In my head, I started calling him ""Aziz the Ripper.""

Every day, I felt closer to understanding his plan. He was looking for someone specific. Someone who moved around constantly. Someone Aziz was determined to find and kill. The thoughts I heard in his head were filled with details about this potential victim's habits, possible locations, ways to trap them. He described this person with disgusting terms: ""the parasite,"" ""the hidden one,"" ""the carrion eater."" I interpreted all of this as him trying to dehumanize his victim to make the act of killing easier, just like serial killers do.

I started painting a picture of this victim in my mind. Surely someone weak, alone, that's why Aziz chose them. Maybe homeless, maybe a loner. I began to feel pity for this unknown victim, and at the same time, rage towards Aziz. How could someone be this evil?

I reached a point where I knew where he was going before he even went there. I'd memorized his thought patterns and plans that well. And one day, I felt it – tonight was the night. His thoughts were all centered around one location: an old, forgotten cemetery on the outskirts of Cairo. An area known for being unsafe at night.

""Tonight… must finish him tonight… in his favorite place… among the dead, just like him… he won't escape… I'll corner him…"". These thoughts were like gunshots in my head. I knew he intended to commit his crime there.

Fear gripped me and wouldn't let go. What should I do? Call the police? How would they believe me? Tell them I read minds and I know a guy is going to kill someone else in the cemetery? They'd think I was crazy and lock me up. No, I had to act myself. I had to stop him.

I went to the cemetery just before sunset. A gloomy, desolate place. Graves were broken and scattered, weeds and wild grass grew everywhere. The smell of dirt and decay hung heavy in the air. I hid behind a large, broken tombstone and waited. My heart felt like it would burst from fear and anticipation.

After about an hour, as darkness began to cloak the place, I spotted a figure approaching from a distance. It was Aziz. Walking with the same confident, steady steps. I quickly dove into his mind. ""Close… very close… the scent is stronger… hungry… looking for easy prey… but I'll be the one waiting…"".

Easy prey? Oh God, he wasn't just planning to kill his target, it seemed like he was looking for anyone else too! This man was far more dangerous than I had imagined.

A little later, I heard other footsteps approaching from a different direction. Light, cautious steps. I saw another silhouette drawing near, indistinct in the darkness. Aziz saw it too. His entire body tensed, like a lion spotting its quarry. I tuned into Aziz's mind again. ""There he is… in the flesh… hiding in human form… but I see him… see his disgusting truth… tonight's your end, you son of a bitch…"".

Hiding in human form? What did that mean? The words were strange. But I didn't dwell on it then, my only concern was that a life was about to be extinguished. The second figure got closer, and its features became slightly clearer. It was an old man, or looked like one, walking with a slight limp, clutching a black plastic bag. He looked so pathetic, like a beggar or some poor soul.

Aziz began to move slowly towards him, like a predator closing in. He pulled something long and thin from under his clothes; it glinted in the faint moonlight filtering through the clouds. It looked like a long metal spike or a very large switchblade.

This was it. He was going to do it. This poor old man was going to die right now. I couldn't stand it. I had to do something.

In a moment of madness, or maybe courage, or maybe stupidity, I burst out from behind the tombstone and screamed at the top of my lungs: ""LOOK OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???""

Aziz spun around, shock mixed with fury on his face. The old man also stopped and looked at me. For a second, time froze.

""You?! What the hell are you doing here, you idiot? Get back!"" That was Aziz's voice, laced with warning and anger.

""I won't let you kill him! You murderer!"" I yelled, moving towards him, not knowing what I intended to do – maybe hit him, maybe distract him until the old man could escape.

""Kill him? Kill who, you moron? You don't understand anything! Get away!"" Aziz yelled at me again, but his eyes darted back to the old man, who was just standing there, watching us with a strange coldness.

And in the instant Aziz turned his attention to me, the old man moved. But it wasn't the movement of a limping old man. It was fast, terrifyingly fast, unnaturally fast. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Aziz.

And I heard a sound… a sickening crack. The sound of bones breaking. And I saw something I will never forget as long as I live. The old man's face began to… change. To stretch and contort. His eyes turned into burning red embers, his mouth opened impossibly wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth like nails. His thin, wrinkled hands became long, black claws. The plastic bag dropped from his grasp, and I heard the clatter of something hitting the ground… bones?

Aziz was trying to fight back, striking with the metal spike, but this… thing was much faster, much stronger. I heard Aziz scream, not in pain, no, but in rage and despair: ""Ghoul!! You son of a ***! I knew it!!""

Ghoul? What did that mean? I was frozen solid, unable to move, unable to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a horror movie; this was real! The man I thought was a serial killer, the man I was trying to ""save"" a victim from… he was hunting a real monster! And the pathetic old man I intervened to protect… he was the monster!

This creature, this Ghoul, grabbed Aziz by the neck and lifted him into the air like a rag doll. Aziz was flailing, gasping for breath. His eyes met mine for a fraction of a second. I saw a look in them… not blame, not exactly, but despair and terror for my fate. As if saying: ""See what you've done? You caused this!"".

And then… with a sickening ripping sound, like wet cloth tearing… the Ghoul tore Aziz's head from his body.

Blood sprayed everywhere. Aziz's body crumpled to the ground like a heap of meat, his head landed a moment later, eyes still wide open, staring right at me.

I was still standing there, petrified, my mind refusing to believe it. Everything happened so fast. All those thoughts I'd heard in Aziz's head… ""the filth,"" ""the parasite,"" ""hiding in human form,"" ""his rotten stench,"" ""must finish him""… none of it was a description of a human victim. It was a literal description of the terrifying entity standing before me now. Aziz wasn't a serial killer… he was a hunter. A Ghoul hunter. And I… I had killed him. With my stupid intervention, I had sentenced him to death.

The Ghoul casually tossed Aziz's head aside. And then… it turned towards me.

Oh, God. The look in its eyes. There was no anger, no human expression at all. There was… hunger. A cold, primal, absolute hunger. And a smile. A wide smile revealing all its pointed teeth, dripping thick, black, viscous saliva.

""You…"" The voice that came out wasn't the old man's voice, wasn't even human. It was a deep, guttural rasp, like grinding stones. ""…smell… good… like the hunter… but softer… you'll make… a… tasty… meal…""

In that instant, my legs started working on their own. Pure, unadulterated fear-adrenaline surged through me. I turned and started running. Running like a madman among the broken graves, unable to see clearly, the only thought in my head was to get away from this nightmare. Behind me, I heard heavy, fast footsteps, and the sound of the Ghoul's horrifying, rasping laughter.

""Won't… escape… me… I… smelled you… now…""

I kept running and running, I don't know how I got out of that cemetery and reached the street. I jumped into the first taxi I saw and screamed at the driver to just go, fast, anywhere far away from here. The driver kept glancing at me nervously in the rearview mirror; my face must have been deathly pale, my clothes covered in dirt, maybe even blood. I couldn't say anything, I was shaking too badly to form words.

I got out somewhere I didn't recognize and just wandered the streets like a lost soul, looking over my shoulder every few seconds, feeling like it was following me, feeling like it could see me. My mind kept replaying the image of Aziz's severed head, the image of the Ghoul smiling at me. It was my fault. I did this. If I had just let Aziz do his job, that monster would be dead now. But my curiosity, my ego, my false sense of heroism… they led to this.

I ended up in an internet cafe, sat here until morning. Ordered coffee, don't know how I drank it. My hands are still shaking. I started writing this post; someone has to know. Someone has to believe me.

I don't know what to do now. I killed the only person who could have protected me from that thing. And that Ghoul… it saw my face. It smelled me. It said it wouldn't forget me. It said I smelled good.

It's looking for me now, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. I feel its cold gaze on me even as I sit here among people in this cafe. Every face I see, I suspect it might be the Ghoul, hidden in another form. Every footstep behind me makes me jump.

I'm the new prey. The hunter is dead, and the monster is hungry.

I'm writing this, and my hands are trembling. I don't know what I'll do or where I'll go. I feel like my end is near. I hear footsteps outside the cafe… heavy steps… unnatural…

I have to stop now… I feel someone watching me from the window… its eyes… its eyes are red…

Oh God, help me… If anyone reads this… please… be careful… The monsters are among us… and don't believe everything you see or hear… even inside your own head…

Forgive me…

- I read that people mod it but is it worth the hassle of modding it? I saw Shades of Coffee mod which is more than enough for me if done like I am not looking for profiles or any graphs just a PID is enough for me
- Assume the fact that I didn’t mod it, I have to temp surf with it or the new ones have better handling?
- I am going to use it as a home machine but some of my friends offered to do coffee for them at events, will it break if I used it on events or it can handle similar to a store commercial machine? If modding it makes it capable to handle that load then I might be inclined towards modding it since I did get offered to do at several events 
- does the steam wand take time to work if I brewed coffee with it or I can use it instantly after doing a shot? Since it is a single boiler machine

Guys, I have to write this down, right now. I don't know if I'll finish, I don't know who will even believe me, but I have to try. Someone needs to know. My name is Adam, just a regular young guy like anyone else here in Cairo, maybe the only difference is… I have a gift? A curse? I don't know what to call it. I can hear people's thoughts. Yes, exactly like that. I read what's inside their heads.

It started when I was a kid. I thought they were hallucinations at first, voices inside my head that weren't mine. With time, I understood I was hearing the thoughts of those around me. It was terrifying initially, then it became amusing, then… an addiction. You can't imagine the amount of nonsense, drama, and crazy daydreams swirling in people's minds while you're just walking down the street or riding the metro. I used to entertain myself with them – finding out who hated their boss, who was cheating on their spouse, who was sick of their life, who was planning to skip work. I felt like a superhero sometimes, or maybe a little devil, eavesdropping on their deepest secrets with nobody the wiser. It gave me a sense of power, of being special… a feeling that I was different, that I saw the truth behind people's masks.

I was addicted to that feeling. I reached a point where I couldn't interact with anyone without taking a ""peek"" inside their head first. Know their intentions, know what they really thought of me. I started judging people based on their thoughts, not their words or actions. Sometimes I'd discover incredibly kind souls hidden inside, other times I'd crash into an indescribable amount of malice, spite, and hatred concealed behind fake smiles. It was like the internet, a vast ocean full of good and bad, but I focused more on the bad – it was more entertaining, more dramatic.

I know it's wrong. I know it's rude and a violation of privacy, but I couldn't resist. Like someone who discovers they can open any locked door – naturally, they'll try every door. I felt like the director watching the backstage chaos of life's daily play. Sometimes I used it to my advantage – figuring out what the professor would focus on in an exam, finding out if the girl I liked thought about me (which usually ended in disappointment), knowing if someone was trying to cheat me in a deal. But mostly, I used it for pure amusement. Like scrolling through Facebook and seeing people's scandals and problems, I did that live, directly from the source.

About a month ago, I started feeling a bit bored. All the thoughts became repetitive – same worries, same problems, same trivialities. I felt like someone watching the same movie every day. Until I met him.

I was at the Sadat metro station, crowded as usual, the air thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and cigarette smoke. While waiting for the train, I noticed a man standing a bit off to the side, alone. He looked completely ordinary, maybe a bit rugged. Worn-out jeans, a faded t-shirt, sharp, typically Egyptian features, but nothing particularly attention-grabbing. Maybe late thirties, early forties. He wasn't doing anything special, just standing there, looking towards the tunnel where the train arrives, like everyone else. But there was something strange about him, an aura of calm and intense focus amidst all the noise. People around him were shouting, talking, laughing, and he was completely oblivious, like he was in another world.

Curiosity killed me, as usual. I thought I'd just ""take a look,"" see what this guy was thinking about. I focused on him, like I always do, like aiming a satellite dish to receive a specific channel. And in an instant, I was inside his head.

Oh my God.

The voice I heard inside my mind wasn't like any voice I'd heard before. There were no worries about work or problems at home or idle daydreams. There was… sharp focus, like a laser beam. And images. Images flashing by with terrifying speed. A dark alleyway. Hurried footsteps. Short, ragged breaths. Then… a muffled scream. Blood. So much blood.

I flinched, taking a step back. My heart was pounding. What was that? What did I just hear? I tried again, more cautiously this time.

The thoughts were clearer… and more horrifying. ""Have to find him tonight… won't escape me again… must finish him… this filth needs to be cleaned up… his rotten stench fills the place… but where?… must focus…"". These words repeated like a broken record, mixed with images of bloody violence, distorted faces, disgusting things I couldn't quite identify. But the constant theme was the determination to ""cleanse,"" to ""get rid of"" something or someone he described with the foulest terms.

The train arrived, people pushed forward as usual. I saw him move calmly and board the train. A shiver ran down my spine. This man wasn't normal. These weren't the thoughts of an ordinary person. These were the thoughts of… a killer. Maybe a serial killer? The idea made my stomach churn. For the first time since discovering my ""gift,"" I felt real fear. Fear not just for myself, but fear of what this man might do.

I got on the same train, standing a little distance away, but keeping my eyes on him. Every few minutes, I'd ""peek"" into his mind again. Same bloody thoughts, same terrifying focus. He was like a predator stalking its prey. Who was his prey? And why did he want to kill them so brutally?

""I have to watch him."" That was the decision I made right then. A strange sense of responsibility suddenly fell upon me. I was the only one who knew what this man was thinking. I was the only one who could possibly stop him. Part of me was terrified and wanted to run as far away as possible, but the larger part – the curious part addicted to thrills, and the part that suddenly felt like a hero – was determined to see this through.

He got off at a station near downtown, and I followed him. He walked through side streets, his steps quick and steady. I followed cautiously, trying not to be noticed. He entered a small, dingy local cafe, sitting at a table in a dark corner by himself. I ordered something to drink and sat further away, pretending to read something on my phone, but all my focus was on him.

I entered his mind again. The thoughts were a bit calmer now, but still held the same intensity. ""Getting closer… I can feel him… in this area… must be patient… he'll show up… has to show up to feed… hunger will expose him…"". Feed? Feed on what? Or who? This talk was amplifying my terror. This man was definitely dangerously insane.

I continued to watch him over the following days. It turned into an obsession. I started skipping college, lying to my family, just so I could follow him. He moved around a lot, different areas in Cairo, always alone, always with the same deadly focus. I found out his name was ""Aziz"" – or at least, that's the name I heard someone call him once when he was buying something from a kiosk. In my head, I started calling him ""Aziz the Ripper.""

Every day, I felt closer to understanding his plan. He was looking for someone specific. Someone who moved around constantly. Someone Aziz was determined to find and kill. The thoughts I heard in his head were filled with details about this potential victim's habits, possible locations, ways to trap them. He described this person with disgusting terms: ""the parasite,"" ""the hidden one,"" ""the carrion eater."" I interpreted all of this as him trying to dehumanize his victim to make the act of killing easier, just like serial killers do.

I started painting a picture of this victim in my mind. Surely someone weak, alone, that's why Aziz chose them. Maybe homeless, maybe a loner. I began to feel pity for this unknown victim, and at the same time, rage towards Aziz. How could someone be this evil?

I reached a point where I knew where he was going before he even went there. I'd memorized his thought patterns and plans that well. And one day, I felt it – tonight was the night. His thoughts were all centered around one location: an old, forgotten cemetery on the outskirts of Cairo. An area known for being unsafe at night.

""Tonight… must finish him tonight… in his favorite place… among the dead, just like him… he won't escape… I'll corner him…"". These thoughts were like gunshots in my head. I knew he intended to commit his crime there.

Fear gripped me and wouldn't let go. What should I do? Call the police? How would they believe me? Tell them I read minds and I know a guy is going to kill someone else in the cemetery? They'd think I was crazy and lock me up. No, I had to act myself. I had to stop him.

I went to the cemetery just before sunset. A gloomy, desolate place. Graves were broken and scattered, weeds and wild grass grew everywhere. The smell of dirt and decay hung heavy in the air. I hid behind a large, broken tombstone and waited. My heart felt like it would burst from fear and anticipation.

After about an hour, as darkness began to cloak the place, I spotted a figure approaching from a distance. It was Aziz. Walking with the same confident, steady steps. I quickly dove into his mind. ""Close… very close… the scent is stronger… hungry… looking for easy prey… but I'll be the one waiting…"".

Easy prey? Oh God, he wasn't just planning to kill his target, it seemed like he was looking for anyone else too! This man was far more dangerous than I had imagined.

A little later, I heard other footsteps approaching from a different direction. Light, cautious steps. I saw another silhouette drawing near, indistinct in the darkness. Aziz saw it too. His entire body tensed, like a lion spotting its quarry. I tuned into Aziz's mind again. ""There he is… in the flesh… hiding in human form… but I see him… see his disgusting truth… tonight's your end, you son of a bitch…"".

Hiding in human form? What did that mean? The words were strange. But I didn't dwell on it then, my only concern was that a life was about to be extinguished. The second figure got closer, and its features became slightly clearer. It was an old man, or looked like one, walking with a slight limp, clutching a black plastic bag. He looked so pathetic, like a beggar or some poor soul.

Aziz began to move slowly towards him, like a predator closing in. He pulled something long and thin from under his clothes; it glinted in the faint moonlight filtering through the clouds. It looked like a long metal spike or a very large switchblade.

This was it. He was going to do it. This poor old man was going to die right now. I couldn't stand it. I had to do something.

In a moment of madness, or maybe courage, or maybe stupidity, I burst out from behind the tombstone and screamed at the top of my lungs: ""LOOK OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???""

Aziz spun around, shock mixed with fury on his face. The old man also stopped and looked at me. For a second, time froze.

""You?! What the hell are you doing here, you idiot? Get back!"" That was Aziz's voice, laced with warning and anger.

""I won't let you kill him! You murderer!"" I yelled, moving towards him, not knowing what I intended to do – maybe hit him, maybe distract him until the old man could escape.

""Kill him? Kill who, you moron? You don't understand anything! Get away!"" Aziz yelled at me again, but his eyes darted back to the old man, who was just standing there, watching us with a strange coldness.

And in the instant Aziz turned his attention to me, the old man moved. But it wasn't the movement of a limping old man. It was fast, terrifyingly fast, unnaturally fast. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Aziz.

And I heard a sound… a sickening crack. The sound of bones breaking. And I saw something I will never forget as long as I live. The old man's face began to… change. To stretch and contort. His eyes turned into burning red embers, his mouth opened impossibly wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth like nails. His thin, wrinkled hands became long, black claws. The plastic bag dropped from his grasp, and I heard the clatter of something hitting the ground… bones?

Aziz was trying to fight back, striking with the metal spike, but this… thing was much faster, much stronger. I heard Aziz scream, not in pain, no, but in rage and despair: ""Ghoul!! You son of a ***! I knew it!!""

Ghoul? What did that mean? I was frozen solid, unable to move, unable to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a horror movie; this was real! The man I thought was a serial killer, the man I was trying to ""save"" a victim from… he was hunting a real monster! And the pathetic old man I intervened to protect… he was the monster!

This creature, this Ghoul, grabbed Aziz by the neck and lifted him into the air like a rag doll. Aziz was flailing, gasping for breath. His eyes met mine for a fraction of a second. I saw a look in them… not blame, not exactly, but despair and terror for my fate. As if saying: ""See what you've done? You caused this!"".

And then… with a sickening ripping sound, like wet cloth tearing… the Ghoul tore Aziz's head from his body.

Blood sprayed everywhere. Aziz's body crumpled to the ground like a heap of meat, his head landed a moment later, eyes still wide open, staring right at me.

I was still standing there, petrified, my mind refusing to believe it. Everything happened so fast. All those thoughts I'd heard in Aziz's head… ""the filth,"" ""the parasite,"" ""hiding in human form,"" ""his rotten stench,"" ""must finish him""… none of it was a description of a human victim. It was a literal description of the terrifying entity standing before me now. Aziz wasn't a serial killer… he was a hunter. A Ghoul hunter. And I… I had killed him. With my stupid intervention, I had sentenced him to death.

The Ghoul casually tossed Aziz's head aside. And then… it turned towards me.

Oh, God. The look in its eyes. There was no anger, no human expression at all. There was… hunger. A cold, primal, absolute hunger. And a smile. A wide smile revealing all its pointed teeth, dripping thick, black, viscous saliva.

""You…"" The voice that came out wasn't the old man's voice, wasn't even human. It was a deep, guttural rasp, like grinding stones. ""…smell… good… like the hunter… but softer… you'll make… a… tasty… meal…""

In that instant, my legs started working on their own. Pure, unadulterated fear-adrenaline surged through me. I turned and started running. Running like a madman among the broken graves, unable to see clearly, the only thought in my head was to get away from this nightmare. Behind me, I heard heavy, fast footsteps, and the sound of the Ghoul's horrifying, rasping laughter.

""Won't… escape… me… I… smelled you… now…""

I kept running and running, I don't know how I got out of that cemetery and reached the street. I jumped into the first taxi I saw and screamed at the driver to just go, fast, anywhere far away from here. The driver kept glancing at me nervously in the rearview mirror; my face must have been deathly pale, my clothes covered in dirt, maybe even blood. I couldn't say anything, I was shaking too badly to form words.

My mind kept replaying the image of Aziz's severed head, the image of the Ghoul smiling at me. It was my fault. I did this. If I had just let Aziz do his job, that monster would be dead now. But my curiosity, my ego, my false sense of heroism… they led to this.

I ended up in an internet cafe, sat here until morning. Ordered coffee, don't know how I drank it. My hands are still shaking. I started writing this post; someone has to know. Someone has to believe me.

I don't know what to do now. I killed the only person who could have protected me from that thing. And that Ghoul… it saw my face. It smelled me. It said it wouldn't forget me. It said I smelled good.

It's looking for me now, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. I feel its cold gaze on me even as I sit here among people in this cafe. Every face I see, I suspect it might be the Ghoul, hidden in another form. Every footstep behind me makes me jump.

I'm the new prey. The hunter is dead, and the monster is hungry.

Oh God, help me… If anyone reads this… please… be careful… The monsters are among us… and don't believe everything you see or hear… even inside your own head…

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of the best glass tumbler with straw involves evaluating several key features that contribute to its overall performance and user satisfaction.

**Material Quality:** This encompasses the type of glass used, such as borosilicate or soda-lime glass. Borosilicate glass is highly resistant to thermal shock, making it ideal for both hot and cold beverages. Soda-lime glass is more common and cost-effective, though less resistant to temperature changes. The straw material also matters, with options including glass, stainless steel, and silicone. Each material offers different durability and ease of cleaning.

The Choice of glass is a critical factor for both safety and longevity, ensuring that the tumbler can withstand daily use and temperature variations without shattering or leaching harmful chemicals.

**Insulation Performance:** Many glass tumblers feature double-walled insulation to maintain beverage temperature for extended periods. This insulation creates a vacuum between the inner and outer layers of glass, preventing heat transfer. The insulation performance directly impacts how long a drink stays cold or hot, which is particularly important for commuters or those who spend long hours at their desks.

Double-walled construction helps to keep cold drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot drinks hot for up to 8 hours, depending on the ambient temperature.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design includes factors such as the tumbler's shape, color, and overall visual appeal. Ergonomic designs are easier to hold and carry, while a variety of colors and finishes allow users to express their personal style. Some tumblers come with custom sleeves or grips for added comfort and protection.

A Well-designed tumbler not only looks good but also enhances the user experience, making hydration a more enjoyable part of daily life.

**Leak-Proof Lid and Straw Design:** The lid's sealing mechanism is crucial for preventing spills, especially when the tumbler is transported in a bag or car. Look for lids with silicone gaskets or other secure closures. The straw design should also be considered, as some straws are angled or have a wider diameter for easier sipping.

An Effective leak-proof lid and straw combination ensures that the tumbler is practical and reliable for on-the-go use, minimizing the risk of messes and wasted beverages.

**Capacity and Portability:** Glass tumblers with straws come in various sizes, ranging from smaller 12-ounce options to larger 32-ounce ones. The ideal capacity depends on individual hydration needs and usage scenarios. Portability is also a key factor, with some tumblers designed to fit in standard cup holders and feature lightweight construction for easy carrying.

Selecting the right capacity and ensuring easy portability are crucial for making the tumbler a convenient companion for work, travel, and outdoor activities.

Key features of the best glass tumbler with straw:
* High-quality, durable glass
* Effective double-walled insulation
* Stylish and ergonomic design
* Leak-proof lid and straw

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about glass tumblers with straws to help you make an informed purchasing decision.

**Are glass tumblers with straws safe to use with hot beverages?**

Yes, provided the tumbler is made of borosilicate glass. Borosilicate glass is specifically designed to withstand thermal shock, making it safe for both hot and cold liquids. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the tumbler is rated for hot beverages.

Using a tumbler not rated for high temperatures can cause the glass to crack or shatter, posing a safety risk.

**How do I clean my glass tumbler with a straw effectively?**

Most glass tumblers are dishwasher-safe, making them easy to clean. For hand-washing, use warm, soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub the inside of the tumbler. The straw can be cleaned with a straw brush. Rinse thoroughly and allow to air dry.

Regular cleaning prevents the buildup of bacteria and ensures that your tumbler remains hygienic.

**What is the difference between single-walled and double-walled glass tumblers?**

Single-walled glass tumblers consist of a single layer of glass, while double-walled tumblers have two layers of glass with a vacuum between them. Double-walled tumblers provide insulation, keeping beverages hot or cold for longer periods. They also prevent condensation on the outside of the tumbler.

Double-walled construction offers superior temperature retention and prevents exterior condensation, making it a better choice for those who want to keep their drinks at the desired temperature.

**Are glass tumblers with straws environmentally friendly?**

Yes, glass tumblers are a more environmentally friendly alternative to single-use plastic bottles and cups. Glass is recyclable and reusable, reducing plastic waste. By using a glass tumbler, you can minimize your environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.

Choosing a glass tumbler over disposable options helps reduce plastic pollution and promotes eco-conscious habits.

**EXT. SPACE — DESTINY**

*Destiny drops out of FTL abruptly. The camera pans to show a golden-hued planet in the distance.*

**INT. DESTINY — CONTROL INTERFACE ROOM**

*Lights flicker as the ship stabilizes.*

**YOUNG (V.O.)**  
(urgent, over intercom)  
Bridge, report.

**INT. BRIDGE**

**VOLKER**  
The ship exited FTL on its own. There's a Stargate on that planet... but it's outside the system. Isolated.

**ELI**  
(confused)  
That shouldn’t be possible. The Ancients never... reached this far.

**GREER**  
(eyeing the screen)  
But there's a Gate. Right there.

**INT. DESTINY — CORRIDOR**

*Rush appears suddenly from a corridor, looking unkempt and slightly off-balance.*

**RUSH**  
(flatly, almost to himself)  
Something’s pulling us here.

*He walks past the others toward the interface room without waiting for explanation.*

**END TEASER**

# ACT 1

**INT. DESTINY — GATE ROOM**

*The gate dials. Everyone watches silently as the wormhole stabilizes.*

**YOUNG**  
Eli, Greer, Rush, James—you're going. No idea what’s down there. Rush, you sure you’re good?

**RUSH**  
(smiling thinly)  
I’ve never been more certain. We need to see it.

**INT. PLANET SURFACE — GOLDEN BARREN PLAINS — DAY**

*The team emerges into a scorched golden light. The planet is barren, with jagged hills and strange magnetic static crackling in the distance.*

**ELI**  
(looking around)  
Well, this is welcoming.

**GREER**  
(eyeing surroundings)  
This place gives me bad vibes already.

**JAMES**  
Let's keep our heads on straight.

**RUSH**  
(mumbling)  
The signal’s not random. The math... the math is perfect.

*He wanders a few steps ahead, eyes glassy. Eli frowns, watching him.*

**INT. DESTINY — CORRIDOR (BRODY & VOLKER)**

*Back on the ship, Brody walks with Volker down a corridor lined with partially stripped bulkheads.*

**BRODY**  
I'm rerouting power to stabilize the hydroponics deck. Shields can wait.

**VOLKER**  
Greer’s gonna love hearing that.

**EXT. PLANET SURFACE — CANYON RIDGE**

*Rush stops at a ridge and stares down at a strange rectangular artifact embedded in rock—faintly glowing. Not Ancient in obvious design, but eerily familiar.*

**ELI**  
Wait... is that Ancient?

**RUSH**  
No. Yes. I don’t know. It’s... not something they’d admit to.

*Rush kneels, running his fingers over strange symbols. His breathing becomes erratic.*

**JAMES**  
Rush?

**GREER**  
Eli, what’s wrong with him?

**ELI**  
(pulling out scanner)  
I think he’s interfacing... with something. But nothing’s powered.

# ACT 2

**INT. PLANET SURFACE — LATER**

*Rush’s behavior grows more erratic. He talks to himself in broken phrases—half Ancient, half English.*

**RUSH**  
(nonsensical)  
—convergent cycle... parallel harmonics, no causality—

**ELI**  
(to Greer and James, low)  
He’s not okay. This is more than usual Rush-weirdness.

**GREER**  
You want to pull him?

**JAMES**  
If we can.

*Suddenly, the artifact pulses faintly. A shockwave ripples out, harmless but eerie.*

**RUSH**  
(falling to his knees, laughing)  
It sees us.

**INT. DESTINY — ENGINEERING BAY**

*Brody examines damaged conduits as Young enters.*

**YOUNG**  
Update?

**BRODY**  
Power’s rerouted. Still no full shields. But Eli left notes—he found a way to get the food synthesizers operational.

**YOUNG**  
Finally, good news. What’s the catch?

**BRODY**  
We have parts from the seed ship, but not enough for everything. We’ll have to choose what breaks next.

**INT. PLANET — CLIFFSIDE RIDGE**

*James helps steady Rush. He’s whispering now, calmer but distant.*

**RUSH**  
It’s a failsafe. Or maybe a test. They... they came further than we thought.

**ELI**  
Who’s ""they""?

**RUSH**  
(sharply)  
You know who.

*Greer steps forward, weapon raised slightly.*

**GREER**  
We done here?

**JAMES**  
Let’s pull him. He’s burning out.

**INT. DESTINY — CORRIDOR**

*Back on board, the crew prepares a council meeting. Young, Brody, Volker, and others gather.*

**BRODY**  
Rush thinks there’s a working AI in the wreckage. If we can fix it, maybe we can finally *ask* the ship something.

**VOLKER**  
Let’s prioritize shields. If whatever attacked us returns—

**GREER**  
Weapons. Shields won’t stop another boarding.

**YOUNG**  
We can't fix it all. Prioritize based on Eli’s food upgrade, but keep fallback power to both systems.

**BRODY**  
Then we need to choose now.

# ACT 3

**INT. DESTINY — GATE ROOM**

*The away team returns. Rush stumbles through the gate, visibly shaken. Eli, James, and Greer follow. Medical crew rush to meet them.*

**YOUNG**  
(intense)  
Report.

**ELI**  
Something down there was Ancient—sort of. But it didn’t make sense. It wasn’t like any outpost or interface we’ve seen.

**GREER**  
Rush touched it. Started talking crazy. Like the thing was talking back.

**RUSH**  
(quiet, unblinking)  
It was... older. Deeper. Not just Ancient. Foundational.

**YOUNG**  
Take him to the infirmary. Eli, debrief in one hour.

**INT. DESTINY — MESS AREA (LATER)**

*Council gathered: Young, Brody, Volker, Eli, James, Lt. Halvorsen.*

**BRODY**  
We’ve got power for maybe two major systems and partial backup for a third. Choose wisely.

**GREER**  
Weapons. No debate.

**BRODY**  
(shakes head)  
Shields will keep us *alive* long enough to shoot back.

**ELI**  
(interrupting)  
Guys. I got the food synthesizers online. We can’t fight if we’re starving.

**YOUNG**  
Compromise. Power to food systems. Split remaining capacity between weapons and shields. Rotate priority as needed.

*Volker sighs. James nods.*

**INT. DESTINY — RUSH’S QUARTERS**

*Rush stares at his reflection, eyes sunken, face pale. His voice is low, nearly trembling.*

**RUSH**  
(softly, to himself)  
They didn’t build it to be used... they built it to be *understood*.

**INT. DESTINY — SCIENCE LAB**

*Eli flips through schematics. Young enters.*

**YOUNG**  
That tech down there... anything you can use?

**ELI**  
(slowly)  
No data. But I got a snapshot of its interface. Maybe... I can reconstruct part of it.

**YOUNG**  
And Rush?

**ELI**  
(quietly, firm)  
He’s slipping. I think... I’m the only one who sees it.

**INT. SPACE — DESTINY (EXTERIOR)**

*The ship drifts in the golden system, distant stars behind it.*

*Suddenly, a faint shimmer of distortion. A cloaked ship emerges far behind Destiny—same signature, same slow pursuit as before.*

**INT. DESTINY — OBSERVATION DECK**

*Volker stands at the window, sipping coffee. He frowns, squinting at something in the stars.*

**VOLKER**  
(murmuring)  
Déjà vu...

*The shadow fades again.*

# ACT 4 

**INT. DESTINY – INFIRMARY**

*Rush sits upright suddenly, eyes wide. TJ stumbles back, startled.*

**RUSH**  
It’s not technology... it’s memory. A warning left behind. And now it’s awake.

**TJ**  
Rush, calm down—what are you talking about?

**RUSH**  
They didn’t build it for us. They built it for *them.*

*Rush grabs TJ’s wrist suddenly, eyes wild.*

**RUSH (CONT'D)**  
It’s not alone.

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

*Eli rushes onto the bridge, holding a data tablet. Young and Lt. James are already there, the sensors pinging in alarm.*

**ELI**  
Same cloaked ship. It’s back. Same range, same signature.

**YOUNG**  
(tapping controls)  
All stations, go to Alert One. Divert auxiliary power to shields and weapons. Get Greer to the weapons console.

**INT. DESTINY – WEAPONS CONTROL**

*Greer slides into position with purpose. Red lighting pulses overhead.*

**GREER**  
Weapons online. Targeting by heat signature and last known trajectory.

**INT. DESTINY – ENGINEERING**

*Brody, Park, and Volker scramble at their consoles.*

**BRODY**  
Diverting power from hydro systems to backup capacitors—shields are priority.

**PARK**  
Food synthesis goes offline in 30 seconds.

**VOLKER**  
Don’t care. If they’re not feeding us, we don’t need to eat.

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

**JAMES**  
Shields at full.

**YOUNG**  
Weapons?

**GREER (V.O., COMMS)**  
Standing by. Just give the word, Colonel.

**ELI**  
We're not just being watched anymore. That tech Rush touched—it *broadcast* something. They heard it.

*Young turns toward Eli, eyes narrowed.*

**YOUNG**  
He touched *what?*

**INT. DESTINY – INFIRMARY**

*Rush stares at nothing, sweat beading on his brow. He whispers—barely audible.*

**RUSH**  
They never left. They’ve just been waiting.

**INT. DESTINY – OBSERVATION DECK**

*The lights dim. A faint flicker on the glass. A silhouette appears again, the same shimmer as seen before in “Signal Ghosts.” It moves this time—closer.*

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

**ELI**  
They’re not just cloaked anymore. They’re moving.

**YOUNG**  
Let’s find out what they want.

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

# ACT 5

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

*The bridge is silent but tense. Everyone watches the sensor feed. The cloaked vessel remains motionless in space.*

**JAMES**  
Still no movement. It’s just... sitting there.

**ELI**  
They’ve had plenty of chances to attack. Why just watch?

**YOUNG**  
Observation can be just as dangerous. We can’t assume they’re not hostile.

*Young’s gaze hardens as he stares out the viewport into empty space.*

**INT. DESTINY – INFIRMARY**

*Rush is pacing now, muttering, manic energy bleeding out of him.*

**RUSH**  
It triggered a response... maybe not from them, but from *something.* That technology was a key. A relay. A... message in a bottle.

**TJ**  
Nicholas—sit down. You're not well.

**RUSH**  
Wellness is a luxury we can't afford.

*He suddenly stops, eyes glassy, voice eerily calm.*

**RUSH (CONT'D)**  
They’re not afraid of us. They’re waiting to see what *we* do.

**INT. DESTINY – MESS HALL**

*Eli and Greer sit at a dim table. Eli picks at a half-processed ration pack. Greer’s eyes stay on the door.*

**ELI**  
Rush isn’t just being Rush this time. He’s off. Like… something in his head turned sideways.

**GREER**  
I’ve seen men crack. He’s cracked before. This feels different.

**ELI**  
He touched something down there. Something Ancient... or close to it. And now it’s like he's not alone up there anymore.

**INT. DESTINY – ENGINEERING**

*Volker and Brody argue over a control schematic.*

**BRODY**  
I know the food synthesizers can’t be a top priority, but we can’t keep skipping meals.

**VOLKER**  
You want to starve or get spaced? Pick one.

*They stop as the lights flicker again—something destabilizes for a moment. Volker looks up.*

**VOLKER (CONT'D)**  
We need a decision. Either we fight or we jump.

**INT. DESTINY – BRIDGE**

*The bridge is darkened except for the glow of the consoles. Everyone is in place.*

**YOUNG**  
(quietly)  
Still no movement.

**JAMES**  
We can’t stay in their sights forever, sir. This ship needs repairs. And we need answers, not a standoff.

**ELI**  
If we jump, they might follow. But if we stay, they might *finally* act.

**YOUNG**  
Prepare for FTL.

**(beat)**

**YOUNG (CONT'D)**  
Maybe they’ll take the hint.

**EXT. SPACE – DESTINY**

\*The cloaked ship remains still, eerily watching. Destiny lights up with a low hum and—

**FLASH—** it jumps to FTL.

A moment passes in the silence of space.

The cloaked ship fades once again from view.\*

**INT. DESTINY – OBSERVATION DECK**

*Rush stands alone, staring into the void, a shadow behind his eyes. His reflection doesn't quite move in sync.*

**RUSH**  
It’s only just begun.

1kbc2wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1kbc2wd/i_read_the_wrong_mind_now_the_ghoul_hunts_me/,I Read the Wrong Mind. Now the Ghoul Hunts Me,"
Guys, I have to write this down, right now. I don't know if I'll finish, I don't know who will even believe me, but I have to try. Someone needs to know. My name is Adam, just a regular young guy like anyone else here in Cairo, maybe the only difference is… I have a gift? A curse? I don't know what to call it. I can hear people's thoughts. Yes, exactly like that. I read what's inside their heads.

It started when I was a kid. I thought they were hallucinations at first, voices inside my head that weren't mine. With time, I understood I was hearing the thoughts of those around me. It was terrifying initially, then it became amusing, then… an addiction. You can't imagine the amount of nonsense, drama, and crazy daydreams swirling in people's minds while you're just walking down the street or riding the metro. I used to entertain myself with them – finding out who hated their boss, who was cheating on their spouse, who was sick of their life, who was planning to skip work. I felt like a superhero sometimes, or maybe a little devil, eavesdropping on their deepest secrets with nobody the wiser. It gave me a sense of power, of being special… a feeling that I was different, that I saw the truth behind people's masks.

I was addicted to that feeling. I reached a point where I couldn't interact with anyone without taking a ""peek"" inside their head first. Know their intentions, know what they really thought of me. I started judging people based on their thoughts, not their words or actions. Sometimes I'd discover incredibly kind souls hidden inside, other times I'd crash into an indescribable amount of malice, spite, and hatred concealed behind fake smiles. It was like the internet, a vast ocean full of good and bad, but I focused more on the bad – it was more entertaining, more dramatic.

I know it's wrong. I know it's rude and a violation of privacy, but I couldn't resist. Like someone who discovers they can open any locked door – naturally, they'll try every door. I felt like the director watching the backstage chaos of life's daily play. Sometimes I used it to my advantage – figuring out what the professor would focus on in an exam, finding out if the girl I liked thought about me (which usually ended in disappointment), knowing if someone was trying to cheat me in a deal. But mostly, I used it for pure amusement. Like scrolling through Facebook and seeing people's scandals and problems, I did that live, directly from the source.

About a month ago, I started feeling a bit bored. All the thoughts became repetitive – same worries, same problems, same trivialities. I felt like someone watching the same movie every day. Until I met him.

I was at the Sadat metro station, crowded as usual, the air thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and cigarette smoke. While waiting for the train, I noticed a man standing a bit off to the side, alone. He looked completely ordinary, maybe a bit rugged. Worn-out jeans, a faded t-shirt, sharp, typically Egyptian features, but nothing particularly attention-grabbing. Maybe late thirties, early forties. He wasn't doing anything special, just standing there, looking towards the tunnel where the train arrives, like everyone else. But there was something strange about him, an aura of calm and intense focus amidst all the noise. People around him were shouting, talking, laughing, and he was completely oblivious, like he was in another world.

Curiosity killed me, as usual. I thought I'd just ""take a look,"" see what this guy was thinking about. I focused on him, like I always do, like aiming a satellite dish to receive a specific channel. And in an instant, I was inside his head.

Oh my God.

The voice I heard inside my mind wasn't like any voice I'd heard before. There were no worries about work or problems at home or idle daydreams. There was… sharp focus, like a laser beam. And images. Images flashing by with terrifying speed. A dark alleyway. Hurried footsteps. Short, ragged breaths. Then… a muffled scream. Blood. So much blood.

I flinched, taking a step back. My heart was pounding. What was that? What did I just hear? I tried again, more cautiously this time.

The thoughts were clearer… and more horrifying. ""Have to find him tonight… won't escape me again… must finish him… this filth needs to be cleaned up… his rotten stench fills the place… but where?… must focus…"". These words repeated like a broken record, mixed with images of bloody violence, distorted faces, disgusting things I couldn't quite identify. But the constant theme was the determination to ""cleanse,"" to ""get rid of"" something or someone he described with the foulest terms.

The train arrived, people pushed forward as usual. I saw him move calmly and board the train. A shiver ran down my spine. This man wasn't normal. These weren't the thoughts of an ordinary person. These were the thoughts of… a killer. Maybe a serial killer? The idea made my stomach churn. For the first time since discovering my ""gift,"" I felt real fear. Fear not just for myself, but fear of what this man might do.

I got on the same train, standing a little distance away, but keeping my eyes on him. Every few minutes, I'd ""peek"" into his mind again. Same bloody thoughts, same terrifying focus. He was like a predator stalking its prey. Who was his prey? And why did he want to kill them so brutally?

""I have to watch him."" That was the decision I made right then. A strange sense of responsibility suddenly fell upon me. I was the only one who knew what this man was thinking. I was the only one who could possibly stop him. Part of me was terrified and wanted to run as far away as possible, but the larger part – the curious part addicted to thrills, and the part that suddenly felt like a hero – was determined to see this through.

He got off at a station near downtown, and I followed him. He walked through side streets, his steps quick and steady. I followed cautiously, trying not to be noticed. He entered a small, dingy local cafe, sitting at a table in a dark corner by himself. I ordered something to drink and sat further away, pretending to read something on my phone, but all my focus was on him.

I entered his mind again. The thoughts were a bit calmer now, but still held the same intensity. ""Getting closer… I can feel him… in this area… must be patient… he'll show up… has to show up to feed… hunger will expose him…"". Feed? Feed on what? Or who? This talk was amplifying my terror. This man was definitely dangerously insane.

I continued to watch him over the following days. It turned into an obsession. I started skipping college, lying to my family, just so I could follow him. He moved around a lot, different areas in Cairo, always alone, always with the same deadly focus. I found out his name was ""Aziz"" – or at least, that's the name I heard someone call him once when he was buying something from a kiosk. In my head, I started calling him ""Aziz the Ripper.""

Every day, I felt closer to understanding his plan. He was looking for someone specific. Someone who moved around constantly. Someone Aziz was determined to find and kill. The thoughts I heard in his head were filled with details about this potential victim's habits, possible locations, ways to trap them. He described this person with disgusting terms: ""the parasite,"" ""the hidden one,"" ""the carrion eater."" I interpreted all of this as him trying to dehumanize his victim to make the act of killing easier, just like serial killers do.

I started painting a picture of this victim in my mind. Surely someone weak, alone, that's why Aziz chose them. Maybe homeless, maybe a loner. I began to feel pity for this unknown victim, and at the same time, rage towards Aziz. How could someone be this evil?

I reached a point where I knew where he was going before he even went there. I'd memorized his thought patterns and plans that well. And one day, I felt it – tonight was the night. His thoughts were all centered around one location: an old, forgotten cemetery on the outskirts of Cairo. An area known for being unsafe at night.

""Tonight… must finish him tonight… in his favorite place… among the dead, just like him… he won't escape… I'll corner him…"". These thoughts were like gunshots in my head. I knew he intended to commit his crime there.

Fear gripped me and wouldn't let go. What should I do? Call the police? How would they believe me? Tell them I read minds and I know a guy is going to kill someone else in the cemetery? They'd think I was crazy and lock me up. No, I had to act myself. I had to stop him.

I went to the cemetery just before sunset. A gloomy, desolate place. Graves were broken and scattered, weeds and wild grass grew everywhere. The smell of dirt and decay hung heavy in the air. I hid behind a large, broken tombstone and waited. My heart felt like it would burst from fear and anticipation.

After about an hour, as darkness began to cloak the place, I spotted a figure approaching from a distance. It was Aziz. Walking with the same confident, steady steps. I quickly dove into his mind. ""Close… very close… the scent is stronger… hungry… looking for easy prey… but I'll be the one waiting…"".

Easy prey? Oh God, he wasn't just planning to kill his target, it seemed like he was looking for anyone else too! This man was far more dangerous than I had imagined.

A little later, I heard other footsteps approaching from a different direction. Light, cautious steps. I saw another silhouette drawing near, indistinct in the darkness. Aziz saw it too. His entire body tensed, like a lion spotting its quarry. I tuned into Aziz's mind again. ""There he is… in the flesh… hiding in human form… but I see him… see his disgusting truth… tonight's your end, you son of a bitch…"".

Hiding in human form? What did that mean? The words were strange. But I didn't dwell on it then, my only concern was that a life was about to be extinguished. The second figure got closer, and its features became slightly clearer. It was an old man, or looked like one, walking with a slight limp, clutching a black plastic bag. He looked so pathetic, like a beggar or some poor soul.

Aziz began to move slowly towards him, like a predator closing in. He pulled something long and thin from under his clothes; it glinted in the faint moonlight filtering through the clouds. It looked like a long metal spike or a very large switchblade.

This was it. He was going to do it. This poor old man was going to die right now. I couldn't stand it. I had to do something.

In a moment of madness, or maybe courage, or maybe stupidity, I burst out from behind the tombstone and screamed at the top of my lungs: ""LOOK OUT!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING???""

Aziz spun around, shock mixed with fury on his face. The old man also stopped and looked at me. For a second, time froze.

""You?! What the hell are you doing here, you idiot? Get back!"" That was Aziz's voice, laced with warning and anger.

""I won't let you kill him! You murderer!"" I yelled, moving towards him, not knowing what I intended to do – maybe hit him, maybe distract him until the old man could escape.

""Kill him? Kill who, you moron? You don't understand anything! Get away!"" Aziz yelled at me again, but his eyes darted back to the old man, who was just standing there, watching us with a strange coldness.

And in the instant Aziz turned his attention to me, the old man moved. But it wasn't the movement of a limping old man. It was fast, terrifyingly fast, unnaturally fast. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Aziz.

And I heard a sound… a sickening crack. The sound of bones breaking. And I saw something I will never forget as long as I live. The old man's face began to… change. To stretch and contort. His eyes turned into burning red embers, his mouth opened impossibly wide, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth like nails. His thin, wrinkled hands became long, black claws. The plastic bag dropped from his grasp, and I heard the clatter of something hitting the ground… bones?

Aziz was trying to fight back, striking with the metal spike, but this… thing was much faster, much stronger. I heard Aziz scream, not in pain, no, but in rage and despair: ""Ghoul!! You son of a ***! I knew it!!""

Ghoul? What did that mean? I was frozen solid, unable to move, unable to process what I was seeing. This wasn't a horror movie; this was real! The man I thought was a serial killer, the man I was trying to ""save"" a victim from… he was hunting a real monster! And the pathetic old man I intervened to protect… he was the monster!

This creature, this Ghoul, grabbed Aziz by the neck and lifted him into the air like a rag doll. Aziz was flailing, gasping for breath. His eyes met mine for a fraction of a second. I saw a look in them… not blame, not exactly, but despair and terror for my fate. As if saying: ""See what you've done? You caused this!"".

And then… with a sickening ripping sound, like wet cloth tearing… the Ghoul tore Aziz's head from his body.

Blood sprayed everywhere. Aziz's body crumpled to the ground like a heap of meat, his head landed a moment later, eyes still wide open, staring right at me.

I was still standing there, petrified, my mind refusing to believe it. Everything happened so fast. All those thoughts I'd heard in Aziz's head… ""the filth,"" ""the parasite,"" ""hiding in human form,"" ""his rotten stench,"" ""must finish him""… none of it was a description of a human victim. It was a literal description of the terrifying entity standing before me now. Aziz wasn't a serial killer… he was a hunter. A Ghoul hunter. And I… I had killed him. With my stupid intervention, I had sentenced him to death.

The Ghoul casually tossed Aziz's head aside. And then… it turned towards me.

Oh, God. The look in its eyes. There was no anger, no human expression at all. There was… hunger. A cold, primal, absolute hunger. And a smile. A wide smile revealing all its pointed teeth, dripping thick, black, viscous saliva.

""You…"" The voice that came out wasn't the old man's voice, wasn't even human. It was a deep, guttural rasp, like grinding stones. ""…smell… good… like the hunter… but softer… you'll make… a… tasty… meal…""

In that instant, my legs started working on their own. Pure, unadulterated fear-adrenaline surged through me. I turned and started running. Running like a madman among the broken graves, unable to see clearly, the only thought in my head was to get away from this nightmare. Behind me, I heard heavy, fast footsteps, and the sound of the Ghoul's horrifying, rasping laughter.

""Won't… escape… me… I… smelled you… now…""

I kept running and running, I don't know how I got out of that cemetery and reached the street. I jumped into the first taxi I saw and screamed at the driver to just go, fast, anywhere far away from here. The driver kept glancing at me nervously in the rearview mirror; my face must have been deathly pale, my clothes covered in dirt, maybe even blood. I couldn't say anything, I was shaking too badly to form words.

I got out somewhere I didn't recognize and just wandered the streets like a lost soul, looking over my shoulder every few seconds, feeling like it was following me, feeling like it could see me. My mind kept replaying the image of Aziz's severed head, the image of the Ghoul smiling at me. It was my fault. I did this. If I had just let Aziz do his job, that monster would be dead now. But my curiosity, my ego, my false sense of heroism… they led to this.

I ended up in an internet cafe, sat here until morning. Ordered coffee, don't know how I drank it. My hands are still shaking. I started writing this post; someone has to know. Someone has to believe me.

I don't know what to do now. I killed the only person who could have protected me from that thing. And that Ghoul… it saw my face. It smelled me. It said it wouldn't forget me. It said I smelled good.

It's looking for me now, I'm sure of it. I can feel it. I feel its cold gaze on me even as I sit here among people in this cafe. Every face I see, I suspect it might be the Ghoul, hidden in another form. Every footstep behind me makes me jump.

I'm the new prey. The hunter is dead, and the monster is hungry.

I'm writing this, and my hands are trembling. I don't know what I'll do or where I'll go. I feel like my end is near. I hear footsteps outside the cafe… heavy steps… unnatural…

I have to stop now… I feel someone watching me from the window… its eyes… its eyes are red…

Oh God, help me… If anyone reads this… please… be careful… The monsters are among us… and don't believe everything you see or hear… even inside your own head…

Forgive me…

1kbc28o,https://i.redd.it/r1570jpfvxxe1.jpeg,Case study: Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts became a penny stock,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Donald Trump stormed into Atlantic City with a string of headline-making casinos—Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the crown jewel: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal. 

It was designed to dazzle—massive, opulent, and funded by high-interest junk bonds. The gamble was real. So were the stakes.

Within a year, the Taj Mahal went bankrupt.

And almost immediately, U.S. casino corporations like Caesars and Bally’s began circling the Atlantic City boardwalk like vultures. 

While Trump scrambled to cover bond payments, Corporate casinos like Caesars was locking in tax offsets, leveraging state connections, and securing Wall Street financing through their corporate backers. 

The writing wasn’t on the wall—it had already been signed in corporate ink. 

Those same corporations would eventually swallow Atlantic City and Trump’s footprint along with it.

When the Taj Mahal finally closed in 2016, the workforce didn’t disappear. 
The dealers stayed. 
The waitstaff stayed. 
The janitors stayed. 

The only thing that changed? 

Their pay got cut, their hours got worse, and the name on the paycheck wasn’t local anymore. It came from a fund manager in New York. 

This wasn’t reinvestment. It was recycling—at a discount.

Today, the same model plays out across the globe. 

Starbucks didn’t win by making better coffee. It won by controlling corners. It planted itself across manhattan, sometimes with two stores on the same block—not to serve more customers, but to freeze out any challenger. Dunkin’ gets the leftovers. Everyone else vanishes.

Walgreens gobbled up Duane Reade. 

CVS finished off what was left of the independent pharmacies. 

Once the field was cleared, US corporations jacked up prices and cut back manned hours. Prescriptions took longer. Help desks turned into kiosks. It wasn’t efficiency—it was extraction. 

McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A ? They are vertically integrated asset systems. They control the land beneath their stores, the supply chains that feed them, the franchise terms that govern them, and the national ad budgets that drown out competition. 

They (US corporate) even control the financing that fuels expansion. If you’re not already inside the machine, you don’t get to challenge it. You’re expected to get out of the way.

And behind it all, the real power doesn’t wear logos or aprons. It operates from the top floors of BlackRock, Vanguard, and Apollo. 

These asset managers and holding companies sit quietly behind every major brand that dominates your street. Caesars is controlled by Apollo Global. MGM is tied to Comcast and NBCUniversal. Penn Entertainment is held by BlackRock and Vanguard. Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot, McDonald’s, Amazon—it doesn’t matter which logo is out front. The same institutional overlords own slices of all of them. Same structure. Same dominance.

This isn’t a market. It’s a loop. A closed circuit of capital and consolidation. And once you’re outside of it, you don’t get back in.

And when someone threatens that loop—someone who knows exactly how it works because he once tried to beat it—the corporate media runs the same playbook as the monopolies. 

They vilify. They distort. They manufacture outrage on command. The same anchors who never lifted a finger when Main Street was gutted suddenly find their moral compass when the threat isn’t inequality—

it’s disruption of their sponsors.

Because let’s be clear: legacy media isn’t neutral. It’s just another division in the U.S. corporate machine.

And now Trump’s back—this time not to build casinos, but to break the monopoly that crushed him. 

And they’re kicking and screaming. 

Because they know it’s personal. 
For him. 
For the janitor. 
For every American who got steamrolled by a U.S. corporation that valued stock charts over people. 

What’s coming next won’t be polite. It won’t be easy. And it won’t be pretty.

But if there’s anyone with the thick skin and raw drive to tear down the walls they’ve built around this rigged economy—it’s him.

And I can’t wait to watch it unfold.
Because maybe—just maybe—Americans will be free once again.
Free from the corporate monopoly that stole their paychecks, their towns, and their future.

1kbc1y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1kbc1y4/how_to_guarantee_failure_in_trading/,🥀How to Guarantee failure in Trading,"
Hi, how are you? Tired of all those videos about how to succeed at trading? Me too! So here’s a complete guide from a behavioral science major on how to guarantee failure.

1. Blame the Market: That wasn’t your fault; it was a good trade, but the algorithm is against you. In fact, nobody wants you to win. Everyone wants to see you fail. Institutional traders and computers are just waiting for the moment you enter a trade so they can make it go the opposite way. They’re out to get you, and there’s nothing you can do about it.
2. Avoid Reflection: Don’t bother reflecting on the trade or keeping a journal to dissect every moment of it. Don’t try to figure out what went wrong; move on to the next trade while you’re upset and jump into whatever you see.
3. Impulse Trading: Don’t make a plan. Don’t be prepared for when things don’t go your way. When you lose again, size up to make that money back. I mean, why wouldn’t you? One good trade and you could make everything back. Screw risk management; go manage some risk somewhere else, you know what I mean?
4. Ego Over Logic: When you succeed, it’s because you’re a genius. When you fail, it’s because of the market. Don’t take responsibility for when things go wrong. It’s not possible to win by chance, so you must be onto something that millions of other people haven’t figured out yet. Believe that you are special, that you are the exception to the world.
5. Confirmation Bias: Join a community full of people who think exactly like you. Get upset when people have different opinions. Your personal truths are universal truths, and everyone else is the problem. Seek out information that confirms what you think and ignore when your beliefs are challenged.
6. Regret Focus: After a trade goes wrong, think to yourself, ""If only I had done the opposite."" Think and think and think to yourself over and over about how if only you had just done this or had not done that, then you would be rich. A millionaire. If only you had bought bitcoin five years ago, if only you had bought dogecoin, if only you had just bought one Tesla call option, if only you had just done that one thing, then your life would be incredible.
7. Disregard Achievements: Ignore all the times you made the right decisions and instead focus on where everything went wrong. Don’t give yourself the credit you deserve, and don’t treat yourself the way you wish to be treated. Discredit your achievements and focus on your failures. You have to be perfect to be happy and to be successful, so perfection should be your standard. Anything other than that is unacceptable.
8. Subjective Thinking: Don’t be objective; be subjective. Don’t make rules for entering and exiting a trade; take a trade based on what you want rather than what you think. Don’t look at things in terms of having a middle ground. Everything is all or nothing, and there is nothing between those two extremes. Everyone is either smart or dumb, and ugly or beautiful.
9. Worst-Case Scenarios: Always find the worst possible explanations for something rather than the possibility that is most likely.
10. Clickbait Videos: When you go on YouTube, make sure you watch the videos called ""The Best Trading Strategy on YouTube - 100% Winning Trades."" Win every trade you take. And also watch all of these videos: ""X Trading Concept Was Impossible Until I Discovered This."" Blah, blah. Watch all of those. These titles are engineered to get you to click on them to make the creator ad revenue, not to help you.
11. Avoid Practice: Do not use Thinkorswim’s on-demand feature to go back in time to practice trading after the market is closed. Don’t spend any time trying to learn how price moves. Watch videos about candlestick patterns, because those totally hold all the secrets to becoming consistently profitable.


12. Common Paths: Since so many traders fail, let’s watch all of the videos that the majority of people are doing. If we want to fail, we can easily achieve that by following in the same footsteps as everyone else rather than separating ourselves from them. If 95 percent of traders fail, let’s not try to think about how maybe we should try taking a different approach. Don’t take a step back and try to figure out why they did this. Don’t take the path less traveled by the five percent. Just follow in the footsteps of those who failed, and I can guarantee you won’t make it.
13. Avoid Hard Work: Don’t do the hard work of sim trading and learning to deal with the pain of continuous failure. Don’t persevere. Don’t push on and quit when it gets tough. You don’t want to deal with that; stick to what’s comfortable.
14. Lack of Effort: Go into it all thinking that it’s going to be easy. Don’t put any real effort into it; expect success within weeks. Wake up at any time you want, open your trading platform, and try to figure out what’s going on in 30 seconds. Don’t draw out any key levels or look at the previous day, week, or month. When that doesn’t work, give up. Don’t reflect on what you are doing in order to try and solve what your problem is.
15. Big Ego: Have a big ego and think of yourself as better and worth more than everyone else. That person who’s struggling to put food on the table and works at McDonald’s? You’re better than them. You’re smarter than them. It’s not something in their life or a circumstance that might be hindering them.
16. Refuse Responsibility: Refuse to admit that the problem with your failures is because of you. When other people fail, it’s because of who they are, but when you fail, it’s because of something out of your control. The market is rigged, and everybody is against you.
17. No Plan: If you come back to try again (which you should not do if you’re trying to fail), don’t change anything. Do not actively take any steps to be better. Don’t keep a Google Docs or a notebook open with a list of reminders to keep yourself from deviating from your plan. Wait, did I say plan? Don’t have a plan. What are you doing, trying to succeed? That’s not what this guide is about.
18. Caffeine Overload: Don’t use any breathing techniques to keep your body calm. Drink three cups of coffee before you start trading so that you’re all jittery. This is especially important to do if you have any anxiety at all because caffeine makes anxiety significantly stronger and more difficult to deal with. You definitely want to have more levels of cortisol (the literal stress hormone) and you also want more adrenaline.
19. Ignore Mindfulness: Don’t actively try to better yourself by implementing techniques like simple forms of mindfulness. Do not set reminders every 10 minutes to just take a second to breathe and be mindful. Instead of acknowledging worries and thoughts that flow through your mind and gently letting them go, focus on every single one of them. Don’t take a moment to focus on the feeling of your chest expanding and falling with each breath. Don’t focus on what you hear, what you feel, and what you see. Just exist like a robot and do the same thing every day. Don’t change. Don’t make yourself better. Become complacent and never strive for anything beyond a barely satisfactory existence.
20. Add Pressure: Quit your job so that there is extra pressure on yourself to make winning trades. Make sure you add as much pressure as possible. If you don’t make a certain amount of money by some time, you’ll have to return to a job. Make sure you put yourself in that kind of a situation. That way, you are shaking with fear every time you take a trade. If you want to fail, you want to make sure that your life situation is one of emotional chaos rather than one of stability.


21. Quick Success Assumption: After one week of success, assume you have unlocked the key to consistency. Next week, when you lose it all, make sure you think that your life is over by not seeing the bigger picture. Don’t have a one-to-five-year perspective on the learning process.
22. Short-Term Focus: Focus on every trade as if it’s life or death. Focus on profits over process. Make sure that everything is about how much money you made or lost rather than what you learned. Since we want to fail, we have to avoid trying to learn the stuff that actually matters. Screw that.
23. Clickbait Obsession: Let’s go to YouTube and watch more videos with ""99% win rate"" and other clickbait that definitely isn’t a lie in the title. Let’s watch trading videos from channels that sell courses for a living and don’t have any proof that they’ve ever even taken a real trade before. Yeah, that seems legit to me. There certainly would not be any conflicts of interest between being a salesman and a teacher.
24. Avoid Change: Remember, at the end of the day, everything really comes down to one thing. If you want to fail, don’t change and don’t keep going when it gets tough. Be the same person for the rest of your life and double down on your beliefs when you face adversity. If you don’t, you might succeed, and that’s not what this guide is about.
25. Ignore Valuable Content: Do not do the opposite of everything I said because every single one of you will

Manager said I’d only be paid for 4 hours of training but made me work over 8 hours unpaid (I have proof). One colleague (same level as me) bosses me around, slacks off, and reports false info to the manager. I’m being denied breaks, threatened with reduced shifts, and possibly facing discrimination based on nationality. Worried I’ll be fired soon. Can I take legal action for unpaid work, mistreatment, or discrimination? Where should I report this (ACAS, HMRC, etc.)?

Hi everyone,

I recently started working at a new coffee shop, and I've been having a really hard time. I feel like I’m being treated unfairly, favouritism etc it may be partly due to discrimination — or at the very least, favouritism and exploitation. The reason is that two of my colleagues (who have been here prior to me joining) belong to a country that is odds with my country historically (think English/Irish, South Korean/North Korean, Palestine/Israel, Pakistan/India kind of animosity). The manager belongs to the same country as I do. I need some advice on what actions I can take, especially if I get fired.

### Unpaid Work and Exploitation

When I started, the manager told me I would only be paid for 4 hours of training, and anything beyond that would be unpaid. He kept insisting I should work for free to learn things faster, and only after that would he start giving me proper hours.

•⁠ On my first day, I completed some mandatory online courses (health & safety, and how the business operates) and was asked to sit in the café *from 2 PM to 6 PM* — *completely unpaid*.
•⁠  ⁠My second training day was Saturday, scheduled for *12 PM to 4 PM, but I actually worked until **5:30 PM*. I am supposed to get paid for only 4 hours
•⁠  ⁠He then told me to come in *on Monday to train for free again. I worked **from 12 PM to 4:30 PM, unpaid again. That’s **over 8 hours* of unpaid work already — and I have *CCTV footage* from the shop that could prove I was there and working.

### Mistreatment by Colleague

On my first working day, I worked *non-stop from 11 AM to 4:30 PM. Toward the end, I was asked to mop the customer seating area. I took about **20 minutes to brush* and *15 minutes to mop. One of the colleagues accused me of taking **45 minutes* to mop.

This same colleague:

•⁠  ⁠Went to Tesco during his shift and took at least *20 minutes shopping*.
•⁠  ⁠Spent *25 minutes talking to his aunt* who visited.
•⁠  ⁠Took a personal call for *5 minutes*.
•⁠  ⁠Sat inside watching the CCTV for *20–25 minutes* while I worked.
•⁠  ⁠Frequently bossed me around even though we are both same level staff.

He even spilled milk and demanded I clean it, despite me already doing the dishes. I brought him the mop, but he expected me to clean it. As I was already doing the dishes,I went to continue that. He stated to the other colleague that I gave him the mop and ignored the milk spill and wanted him to clean it

### Today’s Incident

Today, when I showed up for my shift, this colleague told me, “I’ll decide when your shift ends.” I responded that according to the rota, I’m scheduled until *8:30 PM*. He said, “No, if you finish the mop in 25 minutes, I’ll think about letting you stay. I said according to the shift rota its my break time he said anything over 6 hours is break i said i am here for 8 and a half hours he then again said if you dont finish mop in 25 minutes i will cut your shift , you’ll leave at 4 PM.”

I told him he’s not the manager and I’d rather confirm with the manager. He claimed to have already talked to the manager, so I called — but got no answer. I started mopping anyway. Later, he showed me *messages with the manager, but they only showed **half the story*, painting me in a bad light.

The manager replied to him saying:  
“If he’s not listening to both of you, then tell him to go and be accountable for his actions.”

Now the manager is going on holiday, as he has half the story, I feel like he will be taking the other colleague’s side, he is yet to respond to my messages. I’m worried I’m about to be fired, especially since this colleague has been here longer and clearly favoured.

### Discrimination and Legal Concerns

Given historical animosity between our countries, I feel I may be facing *discrimination*, especially with the way I’m being treated differently. The colleague seems to have authority he shouldn’t

I’ve done *unpaid work* that should legally be compensated. The store has *CCTV footage* that could prove my presence and the unpaid labor I performed.

---

### What I Need Help With:

1.⁠ ⁠*If I get fired, can I take **legal action* for:
   - Unpaid labor?
   - Discrimination or hostile work environment?
   - Being exploited and denied breaks?

2.⁠ ⁠How do I go about *reporting* this (to DWP, HMRC, ACAS, or another authority)?

I was laying on the couch, being lazy after a long day at work. I stood up and suddenly I started to feel really bad.

My pulse was strong in my ears, trouble breathing. Instead of lying down right where I was standing (lesson learned) I reached for the couch, fell awkwardly on the coffee table (bruised my thigh) and crawled back on the sofa. That’s how my husband found me a few minutes later. Of course he was very scared.

After a few minutes of hot flashes and buzzing in my ears I was back to normal.

I have no idea if I did something wrong (I had light meals, walked one hour that day, nothing wild).

It was humbling. Of course pregnancy is not a disease but man… I didn’t expect it to literally knock me down.

Now, I work in Callcenter IT, which is not a competitive field, but one where cheap labor is really easy to find and train well enough, making people with experience worth less as new hires. 

Regardless I applied with my 5 years of experience in Company IT Troubleshooting on a Listing I found. The listing was as usual with IT quite sketchy advertising the familial quality of the company (It's a multi million company with several hundred internal IT members, which is what I was applying to). 

So I sent in my resume, expecting the usual, since I am just as jaded as most of the people here by modern recruitment """"""strategies"""""". Then the shocker! 

The manager of the department I was applying to called me within a few hours of submitting the resume. 
Manager:""Hello, is this [Last Name]?"" 
Me:""Yes, this is [Full Name]""
Manager:""I'm with [Company], and I would like to talk to you about the application you sent in.""
Me:""Yeah sure. Do you want to schedule a video interview or how do you want to do this?"" 
Manager:""Actually, I'm in [Neighbour Town] right now, so if you can, would you be willing to come to [Location] to have an in person interview?"" 
Me:""Today?"" 
Manager:""Yeah, just swing by the front desk and tell them to call me down. I'll let them know you're expected.""
Me:""Sure I'll be there. See you then.""
Manager:""Great! See you after lunch."" 

After confirming that the given address was actually a company location, I headed there, did as told and asked for him and he came down personally, sat down with me for coffee and asked with genuine interest about things in my resume. No bullshit quiz, no gotcha, no recruiter. Just a manager that apparently really cared about getting people who work well with his team. 

After about an hour of chatting he said he still has other applicants and has to go through them all by company policy, but that he'll definitely call within 2 weeks and if he doesn't to please call him directly (gave me his business card) since he doesn't want to ghost anyone.

This happened almost 2 years ago. Since then, my chest pain has been chronic, sometimes especially in the morning I couldn't even get out of bed.

Turned out I have this massive HH. I've been to treatments for placing my stomach back to its place, but it helped little, and temporarily. One doctor I sent the CD of my test results said I'm probably gonna need surgery. Yet my parents are still freaking out about the idea. They tell me it won't help, it's for life, this and that.

I just have to ask how people with kids are surviving?  

My wife and I make good money and we are going to make it work, but the CHEAPEST daycare we could get in for our expected twins the end of this year is going to cost us $750/week or $3250/month.  This is more than our mortgage and we have a nice house.  I don’t understand if we are making good money and our budget will be stretched thin how people making less than us are getting by at all with kids.

We save every penny and virtually waste $0.  We don’t have vacations or date nights.  I play video games and the gym as my entertainment (I don’t pay for the games, gym is $25/month).  We watch streaming services (Prime, Netflix, and Hulu+ with Disney) and that is basically the only disposable income we spend so we can save money by staying in.  I wear Walmart clothes until they are falling apart.  My shoes cost $40.  We don’t buy Starbucks or other coffee places.  We eat out once a month as takeout and I go and pick it up (always cheap like dominos or Wendy’s so less than $30/month).  I literally cannot cut back on anything and make any impact on my budget.

I can’t sleep, I’m always crunching numbers, and always have a high level of anxiety/worry.  If my wife were to be a stay at home mother, it wouldn’t help us since she pulls in $800 more than childcare, so it would only make things tighter.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a marula cream liqueur hinges on several factors, including the source of the marula fruit, the blending process, and the quality of the cream used. Each brand strives to achieve a unique balance of flavors, resulting in a diverse range of options for consumers.

**Marula Fruit Origin and Harvesting:** The origin of the marula fruit significantly impacts the liqueur's final taste. Some brands prioritize wild-harvested marula fruit, emphasizing sustainable and ethical sourcing practices.

The use of wild-harvested fruit often results in a more complex and nuanced flavor profile. Brands committed to sustainable harvesting work with local communities, ensuring fair compensation and promoting environmental conservation. This adds value for consumers who prioritize ethical consumption.

**Cream Quality and Blending Process:** The cream's quality is paramount in creating a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel. Different brands may use varying types of cream, such as fresh dairy cream or plant-based alternatives.

The blending process is crucial for achieving a harmonious balance between the marula fruit's flavor and the cream's richness. Precise ratios and blending techniques ensure that no single element overpowers the other. Some producers also experiment with aging processes to enhance the liqueur's complexity.

**Flavor Profile and Complexity:** Marula cream liqueurs boast a range of flavors, from sweet and fruity to nutty and caramel-like. The complexity of the flavor profile depends on the marula fruit's ripeness, the addition of other ingredients, and the aging process, if any.

The best liqueurs offer a layered taste experience that evolves on the palate. Notes of citrus, vanilla, and spices may complement the marula fruit's inherent sweetness, creating a well-rounded and satisfying drink.

**Alcohol Content and Sugar Levels:** The alcohol content and sugar levels contribute significantly to the liqueur's overall intensity and sweetness. Lower alcohol content often results in a smoother, more approachable drink, while higher sugar levels can enhance its dessert-like qualities.

Producers carefully adjust these parameters to cater to different preferences. Some consumers prefer a lower alcohol content for casual sipping, while others seek a bolder, more potent liqueur for special occasions.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The packaging and presentation reflect the brand's image and commitment to quality. Premium liqueurs often feature elegant bottles, sophisticated labeling, and environmentally friendly materials.

Attractive packaging enhances the overall drinking experience and makes the liqueur an appealing gift option. Attention to detail in the presentation signals a brand's dedication to craftsmanship.

2. 2 glasses of water + banana + espresso
3. Look at the sky to get sunlight, for as long as needed depending on how cloudy it is
4. Active stretching, sometimes some light exercise
5. Either full meal or a protein pudding mixed with a table spoon of peanut butter

9. I have my second (and last) coffee at 1pm the latest
10. Finish some chores around the house
11. Lunch at 3pm - lots of protein, vegetables and not too many carbs.
12. Work on strategically planning my solo musician gigs for the upcoming summer, which is a bit stressful, but also very rewarding.
13. After sunset, I use zero white light around the house. I set only yellow lights, as close to the ground as possible. I do look at my phone a lot, but it is set to blue light filtering all throughout the day.
14. Dinner is a full meal with many different ingredients, lots of protein and vegetables. I have dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed
15. I take L-theanine and Magnesium Glycinate 1 hour before going to bed
16. I don't exercise in the 5-6 hours before going to bed
17. I turn on red LED lights on the ceiling, at the lowest possible brightness.
18. I fall asleep at around 11:30, fairly easily, either listening to guided yoga nidra meditation, or some stand-up comedy.

I struggle to fall back to sleep and when I do, I sleep very uneasy. I wake up nervous, distraught, hopeless about my situation, enraged.

My energy during the day doesn't suffer extensively. I am very productive and healthy. I just worry that this sleeping pattern may have consequences in the future, long term.

💸 *And let’s be honest — with the dollar sliding faster than a greased skweeg on a slip-n-slide, $10 ain’t what it used to be. Three months ago, that got you three coffees and a pastry. Now? Maybe two coffees, and you gotta fight someone for the cookie crumbs.* 😂

* **Ashigaru Field Rangers**: Scouting ahead, crawling through mud, and definitely touching that alien fungus... again.
* **Necrocity Security Guard**: The guy you hire when you want someone disappeared and *don’t* want receipts.

😈 **SISTERS IN HERESY:**

* **Warden of the Great Lies**: From faith to falsehood, she now commands through deceit and dark power.
* **Warden of the Great Lies (NSFW)**: Chaos never looked so captivating. This isn’t just corruption - it’s ascension.

💀 **RENEGADES OF PAIN:**

* **Guardsman of the Changed Way**: Feathered, beaked, and beautifully broken - mutation never looked so cool.
* **Cult Gangers T2**: Burnt, brutal, and born for carnage. These zealots *feel* their way through battle (literally).

🔩 **MECHANIC ADEPT:**

* **Shrimp Automatas**: Swift, silent, and a little creepy. They repair, fight, and haunt your dreams.
* **Colossus Military Gun Polis T2**: Enforcers with big guns and even bigger don’t-mess-with-us energy.

⚖️ **MAIDEN SISTERS:**

* **Warden of the Grand Truth**: Faith incarnate, she holds the line with holy wrath and tactical precision.
* **Warden of the Grand Truth (Pin-Up)**: A glimpse behind the armor - beauty and burden balanced on a blade’s edge.

🎸 **ORKS:**

* **Rocker Mekaniak in Mega Sabatork Armor**: Speaker stacks, buzzaxe guitars, and pure metallic mayhem.

1kbbnsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kbbnsu/how_are_people_with_kids_surviving/,How are people with kids surviving?,"
I just have to ask how people with kids are surviving?  

My wife and I make good money and we are going to make it work, but the CHEAPEST daycare we could get in for our expected twins the end of this year is going to cost us $750/week or $3250/month.  This is more than our mortgage and we have a nice house.  I don’t understand if we are making good money and our budget will be stretched thin how people making less than us are getting by at all with kids.

We save every penny and virtually waste $0.  We don’t have vacations or date nights.  I play video games and the gym as my entertainment (I don’t pay for the games, gym is $25/month).  We watch streaming services (Prime, Netflix, and Hulu+ with Disney) and that is basically the only disposable income we spend so we can save money by staying in.  I wear Walmart clothes until they are falling apart.  My shoes cost $40.  We don’t buy Starbucks or other coffee places.  We eat out once a month as takeout and I go and pick it up (always cheap like dominos or Wendy’s so less than $30/month).  I literally cannot cut back on anything and make any impact on my budget.

I can’t sleep, I’m always crunching numbers, and always have a high level of anxiety/worry.  If my wife were to be a stay at home mother, it wouldn’t help us since she pulls in $800 more than childcare, so it would only make things tighter.  I am so stressed out I can barely think some days.",2,1746002567.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False
1kbbmva,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartBeatStories/comments/1kbbmva/peace_in_the_chaos/,Peace in the Chaos,"The morning train was always packed with commuters, the hustle and bustle of the city never sleeps. Emma stood near the doors, one hand gripping the overhead rail, the other clutching her travel mug as the train lurched between stations. Her mind was already on work. The meeting at nine, the project deadline at noon, emails to send, calls to return, an endless stream of work awaited her. Not that she minded, it kept her busy. There was a comfort in the routine, in knowing exactly what was expected of her. But sometimes, in quiet moments like these, she wondered if there should be more to life than the endless cycle of work and sleep.

The train screeched to a halt at the station with a rush of new passengers pushing their way inside. Emma shifted to make room, pressing herself against the wall as more bodies crowded in. That's when she noticed him—a tall man with kind eyes, trying to navigate the sea of commuters without disturbing anyone. He carried a worn leather messenger bag and wore a baby blue scarf that had seen better days.

Their eyes met briefly, and he smiled—a genuine smile that reached his eyes. Emma found herself smiling back before looking away, an unexpected warmth spreading through her chest.

The next day she saw him again. Same train, same blue scarf. This time though he ended up standing next to her as the train rattled along the tracks. Neither of them uttered a word but there was something comforting about his presence.

The train jerked violently as it pulled away from the station, and Emma lost her balance. A strong hand caught her elbow, steadying her.

""Careful,"" he said, a hint of a smile in his voice.

""Thanks,"" Emma replied, surprised at how her voice sounded—softer than usual.

""I'm James,"" he offered.

""Emma.""

And so it began—no longer was her commute filled with thoughts of work. Instead she was learning about this stranger's life. She learned he was a high school teacher who loved chocolate as much as she did and coached the debate team. His days were filled with grading papers and after school activities while his weekends were spent on hikes and reading.Their morning conversations became the highlight of Emma's day. The chaotic rush of the train somehow faded into the background when they talked, creating a bubble of their own that felt increasingly precious to her as the weeks went on.

""There's a book fair in the park this weekend,"" he mentioned one morning. ""I was thinking of checking it out. Would you perhaps like to join me?""

Emma beamed as she nodded, “I’d like that a lot.”

The book fair was bustling with people but walking beside James felt as natural as breathing. They browsed old novels and found some good deals. James bought her a copy of a romance novel she'd found, refusing to let her pay as he made the purchase.

Soon more dates followed. Coffee dates,  walks along the river at sunset, cooking dinner together in Emma's small apartment while music played softly in the background. Emma couldn’t remember the last time she felt so at ease in the presence of another. There were no fireworks. Instead, there was a gentle unfolding. A quiet discovery of all the ways they fit together so perfectly. He didn't try to change her life; he simply became a part of it, enhancing what was already there.

One evening they were caught in an unexpected downpour while walking home from a cozy diner. They ran for shelter under a shop awning, dripping and laughing as the rain created puddles on the sidewalk.

""I've been meaning to tell you something,"" James said, raindrops clinging to his eyelashes.

Emma's heart quickened. ""What's that?""

""I’m in love with you, Emma"" he said simply, brushing a loose strand from her cheek ""It feels so soon but I know it in my heart. No one has ever made me feel so deeply. Until that day on the train when you smiled up at me, rooting me to the spot. For the first time ever, I wanted someone else's company more than my own.”

Emma felt her eyes sting with unexpected tears. His words touching her in ways she never thought possible.

""I love you too"" she whispered, leaning up as his lips met hers. The kiss was gentle, light as a feather as he pulled away.

Emma had always thought love would be dramatic—a roller coaster of emotions, grand gestures, and fiery passion. But this was different. This was finding someone who made her world brighter, who planted a quiet curiosity which bloomed into a love so gentle, so genuine that it made her question if she had ever been in love before.

But someone did.

He messaged me at 1 a.m.—“Are you okay?”

Just that. No overthinking, no frills.
I didn’t reply for three days. But something about it stayed with me.

We started talking.
He was this sharp, funny, chaotic guy from Hyderabad —quirky in the strangest ways. He talked about his broken past, the financial issues his family was dealing with , JEE failure , Emotional vulnerablity.
I listened and shared too.

We were nothing alike—he was coffee, I was tea; he liked cats, I adored dogs. But in the strangest, quietest way, we fit. We met in that late-night space where everything feels a little more real and a little less filtered.
He made me learn Telugu even I wasn't interested enough.
Guy knew a hell lot of languages and I called that MLD(multiple languages disorder)

He joked about biryani and love and being ""emotionally bankrupt."" But somehow, I felt safe with him.
A guy who was better than my IRL friends.

Prolly the best yapper I have ever known.
A guy as funny as him doesn't exist.
Guy knew so much about science , history , philosophy and I miss that.
He had the weirdest emoji selections amd his texts made me laugh like anything.
An online standup comedian who had the power to light up your mood via texts.
I remember his long lecture on how I shouldn't consider smoking in college which I feel like sharing on reddit but it's way too long.


His JEE didn't go as planned and he knew he was kinda distracted.
We have known each other for more than 5 months.

After his JEE results , he vanished.
I don’t know what happened. Maybe he was overwhelmed. Maybe he was never meant to stay.
But for a while, because of that random Reddit message, I felt seen. I laughed like I hadn’t in months. I believed, just a little, that I wasn’t alone.

So who’s he? Honestly? A broken boy who probably meant it when he connected, but didn’t have the emotional bandwidth to sustain it. Maybe scared. Maybe overwhelmed. But real, even if temporary.


Just needed to let that out.

TL;DR-A few months ago, I posted on Reddit feeling overwhelmed with JEE prep and family pressure. Someone messaged me at 1 a.m. asking if I was okay, and even though I didn’t reply for days, we eventually started talking. He was a funny, chaotic guy from Hyderabad with a lot of emotional vulnerability and a quirky personality. We were very different, but in a weird way, we connected. We shared laughs, deep conversations, and random moments. After his JEE results, he vanished. I don’t know why, but for a while, he made me feel seen and not so alone.
And I miss him.

And some friendships do leave a remark on you.
It wasn't just a casual online friendship where people ghost after 20 days and he wasn't that kinda guy.

1kbbafu,https://i.redd.it/oojvei3rkxxe1.jpeg,"Upgraded to ECM Classika – Loving It, But One Quirk!","Hey everyone!

I recently upgraded from the Barista Express to the ECM Classika, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. The quality and consistency are next level!

What surprised me, though, is that after years of following brew ratios recommended on forums and YouTube, I actually get better-tasting coffee using the ratios from the ECM manual. Right now I’m pulling shots with 14g in and 50–60g out in 23–25 seconds. The result? Incredibly smooth and sweet coffee with none of the bitterness or harshness I used to struggle with. I'm genuinely impressed. I am using medium roast beans from Rwanda. 

However, there's one issue I could use some advice on:  
When I stop a shot (by pulling the lever back down), a *lot* of water spurts into the drip tray—so forcefully that it splashes out onto the counter. The same thing happens during backflushing. According to the gauge, pressure is at 10 bar during both brewing and backflushing (so about 9 bar at the group head, as expected).

Has anyone else experienced this? It seems odd for a €1600 machine to make such a mess. Is there a fix or workaround?

Also, if you have any pro tips for dialing in espresso or maintaining the Classika long-term, I’d love to hear them!
