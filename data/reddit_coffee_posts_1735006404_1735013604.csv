Open to completely moving kitchen.
Also want to redo bathroom, keep bath, larger shower, seperate toilet.
Second pic shows circled rooms. Happy to use bottom-right cupboard space for kitchen.
Third pic clear plan. 

Budget.. depends on how much I like the idea. I'll do most of it myself. Will get assistance from a builder if walls need to be moved. Maybe 20-30k excluding stone benchtop and appliances.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good day, sweet friends! And Merry Christmas Eve for those who celebrate!

Today I just want to say thank you to you all for being here and showing up for one another in the most amazing ways. The daily check-in has been such an instrumental part of my journey. The very first thing that I do every morning (well, maybe the second thing ‚Äì after coffee), is that I come to this Daily Check-In and pledge my accountability to myself, and to you, for that day. By making the pledge to this community, I inherently fulfill my daily commitment to be fully accountable for my responsibilities - because as long as I don‚Äôt drink, lack of accountability is a non-issue. 

To keep myself connected here, one way that I started forging relationships was to make sure that I checked in with others. Those that have been here foreeevvver, those here for the first day, and everyone in between. One cool way to chat with some new people is to go to the comment filter thingy and sort by 'New.' Then scroll the thread to meet new peeps that you might not typically see when it's sorted by 'Best.' As Mr. Rodgers mother told him when he was a boy, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.""

Connection and community are so utterly important to maintaining recovery. I've been on the struggle bus the last couple of days with my mental health, and you have helped me more than you'll ever know with your sharing and loving engagement. You are incredible and I love you.

I am so fucking grateful to be sober with you today.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Pregnancy is a beautiful journey, but it comes with many considerations, especially regarding health and beauty routines. One common question that many expecting mothers have is whether they can use teeth whitening strips during this special time. Let's delve into the safety concerns surrounding this popular dental treatment.

Teeth whitening strips typically contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as the primary active ingredients. These agents work by penetrating the enamel to remove stains and brighten your smile. However, during pregnancy, the safety of these ingredients may cause some worry.

One of the main concerns with using teeth whitening strips while pregnant is the lack of conclusive data on the effects of whitening agents on fetal development. Although these products are generally considered safe when used according to the manufacturer's instructions, pregnancy is a time when many women prefer to err on the side of caution.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Here are some safety considerations you should keep in mind:

- **Consult Your Dentist:** Before using any teeth whitening products during pregnancy, consult your dentist. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your dental health and pregnancy stage.
- **Limit Exposure:** Consider limiting your use of whitening products, especially if you experience nausea or sensitivity. A strong minty flavor can exacerbate these symptoms.
- **Ingredient Awareness:** Always read the labels. Some teeth whitening strips may contain other ingredients or additives that are not recommended during pregnancy.
- **Potential Sensitivity:** Pregnancy can increase tooth sensitivity. If you already have sensitive teeth, using whitening strips may heighten discomfort.
- **Alternative Options:** If you're concerned about using whitening strips, discuss alternative options with your dentist. Professional cleanings or gentle whitening alternatives may be better suited for you during pregnancy.

Despite some potential risks, many dental professionals agree that using whitening strips in moderation is unlikely to pose significant harm. However, every pregnancy is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Always consider your individual situation when making decisions about beauty products.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
The development of your baby is the highest priority during pregnancy. Therefore, paying attention to the ingredients in any products you use is essential. Although there isn‚Äôt extensive research directly linking teeth whitening strips to adverse effects during pregnancy, the cautious approach would be to limit their use or avoid them altogether.

Another key point is to keep an eye on your oral hygiene. Good dental practices play a vital role during pregnancy. Hormonal changes can affect your gums, making them more sensitive and prone to issues like gingivitis. Maintaining routine dental visits is essential for monitoring your oral health because a healthy mouth contributes to a healthy pregnancy.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
In addition to consulting your dentist, you might consider natural ways to keep your teeth gleaming. Things like baking soda, which is a natural abrasive, can help remove surface stains. Sticking to a routine of brushing twice a day and mindful flossing can also aid your dental health without the need for chemical whitening products.

If you decide to use teeth whitening strips while pregnant, ensure you follow the manufacturer's guidelines closely. Do not exceed the recommended usage, and avoid combining different whitening treatments, as this can lead to increased tooth sensitivity or irritation of the gums.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Moreover, listen to your body. If you experience any discomfort, such as burning sensations or heightened sensitivity in your gums or teeth, discontinue use immediately and speak to your dentist. Your comfort and health, alongside your baby‚Äôs, should always come first.

While it's understandable to want a bright smile during pregnancy, your health and safety ‚Äî and that of your baby ‚Äî should be your top priority. Always consider the ingredients, consult with your healthcare provider, and opt for safer alternatives to whiten your teeth. Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your growing baby.

Alternative Teeth Whitening Methods for Expecting Mothers
---------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining your smile during pregnancy, many expecting mothers are keen to explore safe teeth whitening options. While traditional whitening strips might not be recommended during this time, there are several alternative methods you can consider to achieve a brighter smile. Let‚Äôs dive into some of these safe and effective approaches.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Natural Teeth Whitening Remedies

Natural ingredients are often gentler on your body, making them ideal for pregnant women. Here are some effective natural teeth whitening remedies:

- **Baking Soda:** This common household ingredient is slightly abrasive and can help remove surface stains. Mix a small amount with water to create a paste, and brush gently.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Known for its detoxifying properties, activated charcoal can also help whiten teeth. Use it as a paste or in a powder form on your toothbrush once or twice a week.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** This vinegar has natural whitening agents. Dilute it with water and rinse your mouth for a minute before brushing your teeth. Use sparingly, as it can be acidic.
- **Strawberries:** These fruits contain malic acid, which can naturally lighten teeth. Mash a few strawberries and apply the paste to your teeth, leaving it on for about five minutes before rinsing.
- **Banana Peel:** Rubbing the inside of a banana peel on your teeth can provide potassium and magnesium, both beneficial for oral health. Leave it on for a few minutes before brushing.

### Gentle Whitening Toothpaste

When shopping for toothpaste, look for whitening options that are labeled as ‚Äúgentle.‚Äù Many brands now offer formulas that are safe for sensitive gums and teeth while effectively reducing stains. Ensure the toothpaste is fluoride-based, as fluoride helps strengthen your teeth, which is essential during pregnancy.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Hydrogen Peroxide Rinse

Hydrogen peroxide is often found in many whitening products. For a DIY solution, mix equal parts hydrogen peroxide and water to create a gentle mouth rinse. Swish it around in your mouth for a minute and then rinse with plain water. Use this method once a week for moderate staining, but don‚Äôt overdo it, as excessive use can irritate your gums.

### Regular Dental Visits

It‚Äôs essential to maintain regular check-ups with your dentist during pregnancy. Dentists can provide professional cleanings which help remove surface stains effectively. During your visits, feel free to discuss your concerns about teeth whitening. Your dentist can recommend safe professional options tailored to your unique circumstances.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Maintaining Good Oral Hygiene

Preventing stains in the first place is always a good strategy. Here are some tips to maintain your oral hygiene during pregnancy:

- **Brush twice daily:** Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Make sure to brush for at least two minutes.
- **Floss daily:** Flossing removes food particles and plaque that can cause staining.
- **Limit staining foods and drinks:** Reduce your intake of coffee, tea, red wine, and soda, as these can contribute to tooth discoloration.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water, especially after meals, to help rinse food particles from your mouth.

### Consult Your Healthcare Provider

Before trying any whitening method, it‚Äôs wise to discuss it with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your health and pregnancy stage. After all, safety should always come first.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Ultimately, while traditional teeth whitening strips may be off-limits during pregnancy, there are plenty of safe and effective alternatives available. By prioritizing natural remedies and maintaining solid oral hygiene practices, you can keep your smile bright throughout your pregnancy. Always remember to choose methods that are gentle and safe for you and your baby!

### Conclusion

Choosing to whiten your teeth while pregnant is a decision that merits careful consideration. The safety concerns around using teeth whitening strips during pregnancy primarily stem from ingredients like hydrogen peroxide, which may pose risks to both you and your developing baby. While many dental professionals classify these strips as safe, the potential for sensitivity and the unknown effects on fetal development lead some to recommend erring on the side of caution.

If you're looking to achieve a whiter smile without the worries that come with chemical treatments, there are alternative methods available for expecting mothers. Natural whitening approaches, such as baking soda, activated charcoal, or simply maintaining good oral hygiene, can help brighten your teeth without the complications of harsh chemicals. Drinking plenty of water, consuming crunchy fruits and vegetables, and using a good whitening toothpaste are also effective ways to enhance your smile safely during pregnancy.

Ultimately, your health and the well-being of your baby should be the top priority. If you're considering teeth whitening while pregnant, it‚Äôs advisable to consult with your healthcare provider or dentist. They can provide personalized advice and help you explore safe options that fit your individual needs. Remember, a radiant smile doesn't have to come at the expense of your peace of mind or the health of your child.",1,1735012406.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Unfortunately, this has come at the expense of my mental health as my AM is in denial about her mental health. I'm first generation and my parents are Chinese immigrants. I was formally diagnosed with Bipolar years ago and AP didn't believe mental health was real. AD was diagnosed as schizophrenia and spent time in a mental hospital but pretends it didn't happen. I confronted AM about her obsessive habits and she is in denial they're even an issue or related to mental health. Some of her obsessive habits:

* Thinks that anything made in China will give people illnesses. Ex. using a reusable container. 
* Asks me to reuse dirty water for cleaning.
* Uses plastic takeout containers as home decor for holding hand soap and other items. 
* Re-uses produce bags from the grocery as kitchen trash bags. These bags rip constantly and she has to clean the trash can all the time but refuses to buy trash bags. 
* Grilled me on why I bought a 2nd reusable water bottle with my own money even though I only owned one reusable water bottle. 
* Puts dirty dishes with clean dishes but says the dirty dishes are clean. 
* Unplugs any electronic after using even if they need to be used daily. 
* If I get coffee from a coffee shop she complains loudly on how much of a waste of money it is. 
* Saved up boxes of takeout utensils even though there is kitchen silverware. 

I think some of these issues come from a scarcity mindset/trauma and growing up poor but when I confronted her on these behaviors she doubled down on it. She can now afford not to live this way either. I am giving myself a tight deadline to save up and move out as soon as possible. Can anyone relate? ",1,1735011866.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False

Kid is 16 weeks, born previously at 35&2 via c-section due to previa. EBF until hospitalization. Gas and pain started at 3 weeks, blood in poop at 6 weeks. I eliminated dairy, soy, egg, corn and gluten. His tummy was so bad he didn‚Äôt tolerate formula and still isn‚Äôt eating my enough to grow and we need to finish his feeds with an NGT. We were on partially hydrolyzed (alimentum) but switched to fully hydrolyzed (elecare) bc he seemed to develop pain mid feed and it seems to have helped.

I‚Äôm currently doing the ‚Äúfree to feed‚Äù top 12 elimination and will reattempt breastmilk again at the end of the week (which did not go well last time, he stopped eating and had a lot of pain during feeds).

Questions:
1. I don‚Äôt generally see MSPI postings this severe, but his symptoms greatly improved with formula, so I think it is that. Any recommendations about cutting?
2. Any allergies to maldextrin (corn)? I don‚Äôt really feel it‚Äôs safe to stop taking calcium and multivitamin when my range of foods is so limited. I think if he has a maldextrin allergy I will have to give up on BFing.
3. Were coffee or chocolate issues? How about cruciferous vegetables? I‚Äôve seen the vegetables be listed as giving baby gas, but not commonly the protein insensitivity.

The following of what you are seeing now took about 72 hours of nonstop playtime and in-between breaks (and coffee). I'll be here to basically explain the behind the scenes of everything that went down to achieve this ridiculous score. For starters, I wasn't new to 1 Billion score grinds or 1k win-streaks so for obvious reason my collection is fairly huge. Energy Bottles did the hardest lifting for a faster point collecting, so you don't always have to switch out your fighters every time you used them up twice. The huge difference maker in all of this was the defense points. Having a high Fighting Score Team helped out massively toward even breaking my former World Record, it helped me with 6 million points extra once the Prize Fight softlock triggered. I'll explain the softlock in simple terms, it's basically a border that once it's passed, which is 2.146 Billion the game will begin loading indefinitely after a match has been won and the only way to collect said points is to close the game entirely (once you get said error message). After that, your score will update with the points given, however you will be unable to play anymore of said Prize Fight. Like the title suggests, this could well be the Human Limit of the Highest Prize Fight Score ever achieved. I don't recommend anyone to try, and I'm not saying this as a way to defend said World Record but rather, it's beyond tiring to have to stay up 72 hours straight, I had to sleep for 8 hours since I couldn't handle the first day. Obviously, I did eat, shower and drank water since I would have been in even worse condition than I already was if I didn't do the following.  
  
As a side note don't worry about my IGN I changed it to get the attention of an old homie who still played SGM and managed to get his attention after all of this was over. To finally end this yapping I'll just say there should be a way to immortalize crazy achievements like this in game, but I doubt that will ever get considered like it does with Guilds ever dropping",2,1735011753.0,SkullGirlsMobile,0,1.0,False

I don't seem to get caffeine withdrawals. I've drank coffee everyday on and off. As in ive gone fairly long periods of time (several months) where I drink it pretty much daily. And long periods of time where i hardly drink it at all. I don't brew coffee at home but I've had a few hotel jobs and they always offer as much free coffee as you want. I'd only keep it to a cup SOMETIMES two. I guess I wouldn't drink it on my weekends tho. I'm currently working in a coffee shop where I also get all the free coffee I want. I'm drinking anywhere from 2-5 shots a day. Sometimes blonde shots. I get coffee on my weekends sometimes but on days i don't drink it I feel fine.

The only ""symptom"" i get is a craving. But it's not strong and I'm not craving it because I'm trying to get rid of withdrawals. I just like the taste of coffee. I've always drank it for the taste predominantly but some days at work I'm VERY thankful for the boost it gives me as I have to wake up pretty early and I usually get to bed late. I do always get that immediate crash not long after the high. But other than that I don't seem to get withdrawals.

1hl4xea,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hl4xea/the_perfect_home/,The Perfect Home,"When I first bought my condo downtown, I was a mess of emotions ‚Äì thrilled to have my own space again after the divorce, but totally freaked out by the fixer-upper situation. It had ‚Äúpotential,‚Äù sure, but the 70s vibe was screaming for a makeover. That‚Äôs when my friend recommended Tony, this contractor she swore by. I was still nervous though.

‚ÄúMs. Cooper,‚Äù Tony said at our first meeting, really taking in the place, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about giving you the best, not just the easiest. If you‚Äôre looking to cut corners, I‚Äôm not your guy.‚Äù

I tried to match his intensity. ‚ÄúGood, because I‚Äôm not into shortcuts. But, you know, it doesn‚Äôt have to be Buckingham Palace. I don‚Äôt want to lose sleep over every little thing.‚Äù

Tony actually frowned. ‚ÄúYou might be okay with ‚Äògood enough,‚Äô but I don‚Äôt put my name on anything less than perfect.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs how our weird relationship started. It was less like a business deal and more like a polite, almost ridiculous, battle of wills. I‚Äôd tell him to take breaks, he‚Äôd brush me off like I was telling him to slack off. Meanwhile, he treated my condo like it was the Sistine Chapel.

‚ÄúTony,‚Äù I said one morning, handing him coffee, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to burn out. Take Sundays off, at least.‚Äù

He shook his head, already grabbing his tools. ‚ÄúI appreciate the concern, Ms. Cooper, but I‚Äôm here to get the job done, not to take it easy. Besides, I‚Äôm not leaving this job half-done.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not half-done!‚Äù I protested. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already better than I imagined. That crown molding in the living room is amazing.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazing isn‚Äôt good enough,‚Äù he said, totally serious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sand it down one more time.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. Who argues about *too much* perfection? Apparently, Tony.

We started talking more ‚Äì not just about the condo, but about life. I found out he was a single dad with two teenage boys, and he‚Äôd been in the business for over twenty years. He learned I was picking up the pieces after a tough divorce and trying to make this place a fresh start.

One day, while he was meticulously placing tiles in the bathroom, I casually mentioned, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not, like, a celebrity or anything, but I have a decent following on Instagram. If this reno turns out great, I‚Äôm definitely posting about it. My followers love a good before-and-after.‚Äù

He paused, looking genuinely touched. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you. But honestly, I‚Äôd be doing this level of work even if no one saw it.‚Äù

That was Tony ‚Äì stubborn, meticulous, and quietly proud. It made me want to step up my game too. I stopped stressing about deadlines and started bringing him homemade lunches instead of just coffee. He‚Äôd grumble, but I definitely caught him smiling.

Our ‚Äúarguments‚Äù became a running joke:

Me: ‚ÄúTony, you‚Äôre working way too hard. Go home and chill.‚Äù Tony: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre paying me to work, not to chill.‚Äù

Or:

Me: ‚ÄúThat grout looks fine. No one‚Äôs going to notice.‚Äù Tony: ‚Äú*I‚Äôll* notice. And if I‚Äôm not happy, I‚Äôm not cashing your check.‚Äù

By the time the reno was done, my condo was unrecognizable. The kitchen gleamed with subway tiles that caught the light perfectly. The hardwood floors looked straight out of a magazine. Even the grout‚Äîthe grout!‚Äîwas flawless.

I threw a housewarming party. My friends were raving about the craftsmanship. Tony was hanging back, sipping a soda, looking a bit out of place. I pulled him into the spotlight.

‚ÄúEveryone, this is Tony,‚Äù I announced. ‚ÄúThe genius behind all of this. If you‚Äôre thinking about renovating, he‚Äôs your guy.‚Äù

Tony blushed and gave a modest nod. ‚ÄúThanks, Ms. Cooper. But it was your vision that made it happen.‚Äù

After the party, I handed him a bonus check. ‚ÄúFor the overtime,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúand for caring more about my place than even I did.‚Äù

He hesitated, then smiled. ‚ÄúThank you. But honestly, this wasn‚Äôt just about the work. It‚Äôs been‚Ä¶ nice having someone to talk to.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I admitted, feeling a little flustered. ‚ÄúMaybe, when you‚Äôre not busy creating masterpieces, we could grab coffee sometime?‚Äù

Near my house, there is a Popeye's chicken (that is doing great) in a very high traffic area.   The Popeyes has a small store-in-store in it, and it used be a self-serve yogurt shop.   Unfortunately, the mini yogurt shop bombed, and it's been empty for years.   I would say it's about 300 sq. feet??

I thought maybe I could lease this mini store and sell bagels, cookies, cupcakes....and maybe coffee?   The plan would be to buy all the baked goods from a commercial kitchen (or someone else, outsource it) and transport them to the shop prior to open.   Maybe have one of those Subway-type ovens to heat up the bagels, and make them into sandwiches, or just put cream cheese/butter on them.

Anyway, that's the idea.   What pitfalls immediately come to mind if someone with no retail / business / food experience were to try this?

Ever since I started a new relationship a year ago I have ended up lurking on this sub. 

It has been cathartic for me to read posts from others and realise that there is a high chance my partner has bpd. Because it all rings true. I‚Äôve come to this realisation tonight I need to seek understanding and help from this community. Ive not spoken to friends or family about it. My partner and I are both early thirties. 

I apologise for the long post, I haven‚Äôt slept since Sunday. And I need to get this out. I will try to summarise a year of chaos. Even if no-one reads, it will do me good to finally write this all out. 

This has been the most argumentative and stressful and emotional relationship I have ever been in. It started out great, she seemed to good to be true, understanding and vibed with me. We laughed and loved. 

But now the amount of times we have had shouting matches over the smallest things. The threats to break up. Almost flying back on holiday by myself because she got upset that I went to a work friends wedding before we went away, and there were girls from work there. She got mad because she saw a group picture and my female boss was in it, who wasn‚Äôt even next to me. She said I never mentioned her before. (Theres always constant subtle digs or accusations of me cheating on her, when I am not) 

This started a massive argument and ended with me walking the beach by myself look at flights to go home. I then went back to the hotel and endured a 3 hour argument when all I wanted was to be left alone to process what the hell even happened. But then she ended up having a panic attack and I had to console her.

The times Ive ended up crying because I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on or how we got here, why she was so mad. How I had to apologise for everything but trying to get her to apologise is like getting blood from a stone. How I keep holding out hope that maybe I could explain how I feel and she would actually listen to me for once. But no. Its. Always my fault. I always have to make amends. 

I‚Äôm currently sitting in a hospital to get treatment for a bad sciatica flare up. My DR wanted me to try to push for an MRI scan from hospital, I went in and did all of that. The treatment i got in the end was some painkillers and physio. I had an appointment to see my DR a couple days from now. 

The day before we had an argument because all i wanted from her was a hug or some physical comfort for this incredible pain I was in. I told her I had more physical comfort from my male friends at work. An arm around the shoulder or a pat on the back and a ‚Äú you ok buddy‚Äù . I received nothing from her. She was offended. 

She ended up accusing me of throwing my pain in her face. Saying that she was there for me by asking me if I needed anything. She eventually admitted that she couldn‚Äôt provide me physical comfort or reassurance because of a reason she didn‚Äôt want to get into. Probably from a past traumatic relationship, apparently she dated some narcissistic in the past. She accused me of wanting physical comfort to me trying to emotionally manipulate her. 

This shocked me. I have never been in a relationship where my partner would never offer any basic comfort. Again not even a hand on the shoulder and an ‚Äúyou okay‚Äù. 

She was callous and cold and adamant that she had supported me and that I was being unreasonable. She offered to get me something as she stepped over me to sit down and watch tv. Her defence was that I was moving around in pain so she never had a chance to provide the physical comfort. 

I spent that night unable to sleep because of the pain, she never checked on me before I went to sleep in the spare room. She came in in the morning and dropped some medication on the side and asked if i wanted a coffee. No how did you sleep? are you ok? 

‚Äî 

Fast forward to earlier today. I was laying on the floor, she had been out with family and came back happy. We had a playful moment on the floor and kissed. Her friend was coming round soon so she went to get ready. I walk in as she is getting ready and sat im going to drive to hospital and get checked out. I can already tell her mood has changed in a space of minutes. She then drops a bombshell that she doesn‚Äôt feel connected to me lately or even feel like shes in a relationship, she feels single. 

Im like what the actual fuck. The only thing that has really changed is me dealing with this chornic pain for the last two months.  I still see her often, text, watch christmas movies, had a date night. I didn‚Äôt understand where this was coming from. I reacted with frustration because who drops that on someone. All I could think of was my ilness being the only thing thats changed recently, and I said that to her. Again she said I was throwing it in her face. 

She then accuses me of always getting defensive and not listening to her. I had lost my cool at that point I admit, because I was drained and confused. All I wanted was support and got hit with that. 

Her friend then turned up shortly and that argument quickly got resolved to put on a good face to her friend. I was shocked and on edge. Before she left she says I don‚Äôt want to leave it like this. I told her I don‚Äôt understand where all this has come from and right now I need support to deal with this pain as a team. She sort of nodded and then her friend came back into the room and they left. 

Her friend showed more compassion to in five minutes just by talking than she had all morning. 

At about midnight Im sat in hospital and she calls me. She sounds nice at first, but I can tell she has had a bit to drink. And the arguments always come after she drinks. 
I told her that i had blood work done, given medication but no scan. 

She accused me of not pressing hard enough to get the scan. I did, at the end of the day its down to the hospital and they didn‚Äôt want to do that. 

But your Dr said too she said. I said yeah I know, I will see my Dr again in a few days and ask them about it. She kept going on about the scan. She even said, ‚ÄúIt feels like I am pushing more for you to get better than you are!‚Äù. I was shocked. I had driven myself to hospital an hour in pain. No one wants this pain gone more than me, im the one suffering it. 

I kept telling her I would ask my DR about the scan when I next see her, but theres nothing else I could do about it. This wasn‚Äôt good enough for her. She then said great your going to be spaced out on pain killers when you come and see my family for boxing day, you won‚Äôt be any fun. I said I won‚Äôt be spaced out. i then asked her to stop talking as if she was annoyed with me because none of this was my fault and I had done what I could in the hospital. 

She then accused me of being pissy with her. I never said anything rude, I was in a waiting room speaking quietly. I just knew the argument was coming, she went silent again for a while. Then it came, I told her im not doing this, it‚Äôs embarrassing im sat in a waiting room. People and staff listening to me on the phone. 

Guus i cant even remember the ins and outs of the argument because it came on so sudden and out of nowhere. I don‚Äôt even comprehend it, it fries my brain. 

‚Äú I am trying to be supportive I really am and you act like this, i called you because i care‚Äù. Again I never said anything rude, just that i would see my DR in a fee days. It sometimes makes me feel mental. I can‚Äôt comprehend the reason for the argument. She became so enraged like a switch bad gone off. 

She said what have I done wrong tonight. I said all you have done wrong is assume I‚Äôm mad at you when I‚Äôm not. She responded wow ok and hung up. 

I was fed up after that, i hadn‚Äôt slept, was dealing with the pain and now another out of nowhere, unneeded argument. 

I text her ‚ÄúIm gobsmacked and embarrassed sat in a waiting room in pain!. Sleep off the alcohol and get over yourself.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
She then tried to call me five times. And then left a torrent of messages to me as below:

all i‚Äôve done for the last hour is try to support you

and you‚Äôve thrown it back in my face

you‚Äôre disgusting

i‚Äôve been on the phone to you because i care and want you to get the best treatment
and you‚Äôve just thrown it all back in my face

i‚Äôve been out and still all i care about it you and how you feel and making sure you‚Äôre getting the best treatment and you have literally thrown it back at me again

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I replied 

Im not speaking to you on the phone again. Re read all of this in the morning and I hope you see it in a different light and realise how you are acting. 
All I said to you was I would speak to my GP about it on Friday, I can‚Äôt do anything more than that. 
And you thought I was being rude to you. 
I said the only thing you had done wrong tonight is assume I was annoyed at you. And you said wow. And hung up. Then hit me with all these messages. 
Im disappointed.


There has been no reply and I dread the morning. Because I know she will think she has done nothing wrong and handled it perfectly. 

The kicker is reddit. At some point in the last couple of months we had some good spells. Enough to convince me to move in with her. I handed in notice on my flat and have to vacate it half way through January. Now I don‚Äôt even know if she will dump me tomorrow morning and I would have made myself homeless. 

Why does this happen, why do they always assume negative intent and fly off the handle, can anyone else relate? 

I convinced myself she was anxious attachment style and I was avoidant attachment and thats why we miscommunicated. She also says she has ADHD and autism. 

I never said anything rude or mean to her, just that I couldn‚Äôt get a scan and would see my Dr on Friday. Now instead of healing its stress and despair. 

Im fed up. Do they ever realise that they overreacted? that they messed up? That I‚Äôm not some terrible monster. I‚Äôm just a guy who wants to be happy with her. 

I need help from the community.

I do not mean to armchair diagnose in any capacity, but I have a friend who displays many symptoms of BPD, and I do not know how to support her and am feeling quite guilty. We have been friends for around a year and a half, and got much closer in the last calendar year. In the last few months, she‚Äôs had a few relationships (friendship, family, and relationship) crash and burn to some degree. 

Around a month ago, we got into a fight where I was yelled at to get out of her car, along with a few other topics I wasn‚Äôt aware were bothering her, etc. ‚Äî I will not get into details, but I have never been yelled at like that before and was quite rattled. I was able to de-escalate the situation and we parted ways relatively calmly, but she unfollowed me from Instagram that night. 

We exchanged a few texts the next day, where she sort of apologized, without really acknowledging the extreme outburst. She blamed it on being tired and having a drink, and said we could talk ‚Äúin a few months or whenever I was ready to.‚Äù 

I haven‚Äôt reached out yet, simply because I don‚Äôt know what to say. I don‚Äôt feel ready to jump back into a friendship with her, and although I‚Äôd be open to getting a coffee with her I do not feel right sitting her down and explaining that I have concerns about her behavior. So I‚Äôve just been paralyzed and haven‚Äôt said anything, and the guilt is eating away at me‚Äî- at the same time, I don‚Äôt know if reaching out will help. 

She hasn‚Äôt reached out either, and I saw she has now blocked me on Instagram. I know this was a recent block, as I was able to see her profile the other day. 

Should I send her a text wishing her a happy holiday and new year, or will that cause more harm than good? 

I want her to know I still care about her and feel horrible knowing that I also ‚Äúabandoned her‚Äù for this last month (as she mentioned being abandoned by the other people in her life). Part of me feels like I should have more compassion and grace for a ‚Äúone time‚Äù incident, but based on other interactions with her it feels deeper than just a slip-up.

It‚Äôs not that I haven‚Äôt reached out because I dislike her- I care about her deeply- I just think she needs more help than I am able to give at this point, and I don‚Äôt feel able to be her friend in a full capacity at present. Therefore I wonder if I only want to reach out to say this to make myself feel better about the situation, and if reaching out may be more triggering for her and I should just let her be. 

Any advice is welcome, thank you. Apologies for any ignorance I‚Äôve shown in my post above, I am very new to navigating this with my friend and know I don‚Äôt understand all the intricacies.

Her practicality is undeniable, we all know how OP the SP-Adhesives are by this point. Rather than talk about that I'd like to write on her... well 'writing'. Honestly I'm still so mad she isn't in a single Spinoff... I bought those games because of her, yet all I got was slightly more haru screentime than in the original P5 and P5R, honestly I don't care for her, she's an >!akechi victim!< and that gives me mixed feelings for her, on one hand I can understand her >!Anger and indifference towards Goro Akechi, but on the other hand it just feels so shallow, like she's forcing herself to be slightly passive agressive to him!< but enough about Haru aint nobody got time for floof.

To get her romance route (I'm still surprised I managed to first try her entire romance considering how misleading some of the options were, matter of fact I didn't even know you **could fail** a romance, since I stayed loyal to the medical prodigee) you need to *stop flirting with her for one god damn second* and instead show compassion and empathy to Miwa-Chan's situation. No seriously, in order to date her you need to put Miwa above all else, which yeah is kind of sad to see how little she cares about herself but it's also **an incredibly sweet detail by the dev team**, which really aims to show her **true nature** as a kind hearted warm doctor. Oh yeah also they fuck... like in the OVA she **doms** him onto the bed (this isn't a joke, watch the OVA)¬†

But since the OVA's not canon there's also some ingame stuff:  
On, I believe it was white day she scolds joker for being so over the top again and that a man of his caliber is *wasted* on a woman liker her (this broke my heart a bit, I don't really care all that much about **fictional** characters, yet one of the characters with the most emotional impact in the entire persona franchise for me was a random gal made for **healing items**...). On Valentines day she calls herself the Protag's **girlfriend** and that she'll have to stay in his attic for the night (wink wink). She also says that despite her being *terrible* at romance (not true, she had me swooning 24/7) She's willing to be a bit *cheesy* just on that *one* day, **for joker's sake...** (I'm gonna fucking cry)

During **another** romance branching she asks the protag why he bothers showing up all the time as well as helping her out to which he replies to see her (Joker's such a great guy). She gets, *get this*, **shocked** about this - as if it's **unreasonable** to want to see her.

This **finally** extends the dialogue Tree to joker's **big** confession, she asks the MC in a sarcastic joke like manner (as if trying to not get her hopes up) ""What, are you in love with me or something?"" And when you say yes she straight up look **shocked** beyond compare, **baffled**, **bamboozled**, absolutely **flabbergasted** at this revelation (as if she ain't the hottest, nicest, loveliest girl in all of P5R) She **again** tries to joke it off and switches topics to giving the mc a 'special examination'. This however is a **trap** set by the developers, you have to switch topics right back by reassuring her that this ain't a joke, that you are in fact in love like a princess carried by a knight in dashing armor.

Hoo boy... now to the climax, to why this is arguably the most satisfying social link in the persona franchise (excluding sojiro, coffee dad doesn't count, he's too awesome):  
In Rank 10, the romance Path, which by the way all happens inside the caf√© with sojiro being gone, shit hits the fan. She tells him she's gonna need to get a good *through examination* she then leans closer placing her hand on his **thigh** I believe it was and they kiss. ***Screen Fades To Black And Happy Ending***

it's just so well done and makes me sad that many people disregard her entirely purely because she's an adult getting frisky with a teen >!A TEEN THAT, MIND YOU, KILLS GOD FOR!< A LIVING, but apparently isn't independent enough to love a loveable doc.

I've always made it a point in my own life to never dislike someone just because they dislike me, if I care about another person, I'll be there for them even if they push me to the other side of the globe. So seeing this fictional character, this very clearly not real and based purely on fantasy character, seeing her cold demeanor slowly shift made me insanely happy.

A bit about my story. I grew up very poor in a violent home due to generational trauma. We never had much and I never thought about my future as day to day life was simply ""just getting by"". I honestly never in my wildest dreams thought I'd own a home one day or even manage to work my way into a decent paying job, but I did. 

I always had pretty good work ethic so finding work was never a big problem. Over the years I kept finding better and better work, slowly. Discovered something I was pretty good at and it paid decent so I stayed in that industry. Became known a little and ended up with surprisingly high pay job offers. Nothing ridiculous, but much much more than I thought I'd ever earn. Bought a small townhouse at 36 years old, had a decent car and was in a good stable relationship for over a decade. We lived together. No children but we had pets and that suited us fine.

In my teenage years I was diagnosed with severe depression and a generalized anxiety disorder. I discovered many years later it was likely caused by my childhood trauma that I didn't even recognize as trauma. In recent years I was also diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD. I managed as well as I could with medication but I still had some deep depressive phases that snuck up on me out of nowhere and lasted months, sometimes years.

During a particularly extended depressive phase, my partner told me she didn't love me anymore and left. I was too distant and she was lonely and I didn't recognize what my mental health was doing to her own happiness. It was hard, she didn't really take anything from me but I felt as though I lost everything. I started going to therapy and I learned a lot, it helped. But there's no cure for what I have and I was too late in seeking help.

Eventually met someone through work that showed interest in me so I thought I'd give her a chance. What do I have to lose? You never know how good something could be until you try. 

I'm well aware that I was blinded, I was naive and quite literally STUPID so there's no need to point it out to me. She was love bombing me from the beginning and I didn't realize it. Even though I would sometimes think to myself ""this really seems too good to be true"", I also told myself ""I'm just scared, let's just see where this goes. I shouldn't let negative thinking ruin a good thing, let's try to be positive for once"".

Fast forward. She was rebuilding her life also so we supported each other as best we could. I noticed I was much more supportive than her but I've always been like that, it would seem selfish to see that as a problem. She had amazing kids, they seemed to really like me as it sounded like her previous 2 relationships were with abusive men that didn't treat the children very well. I spoiled them a bit because I enjoyed seeing them happy. She wasn't making a whole lot of money and was barely getting by, while looking for better job opportunities. I was making decent money so helping out wasn't a problem. 

I don't want to go into much detail because it's a very long story, but she tried investing and it didn't go well. I didn't know about it until she called me crying that she couldn't pay rent as she was pretty much ""guaranteed"" by this financial advisor that she'd make her money back fairly quickly. She was desperate. I paid her rent because there's no way I'd risk that kind of upheaval on her children, they needed stability.

Next thing I knew, she needed more and more money in order to get her initial investment back, plus the earnings which would have been quite a decent sum of money. Something like 13k or so. I felt suspicious so I looked into it further and did as much homework as I could to weigh the probability that this wasn't a scam. Everything seemed legit, she told me she'd pay every penny back to me and split the earnings also. The only problem is I ran out of money myself, and went into a bit of debt to help retrieve her investment and earnings. At this point I was desperate to help AND get my money back. Investing is risky. Business is risky. There's no reward without risk. I pulled the trigger and borrowed as much as I could from bank loans, enough so that if we lost all the money I'd still have some left over to help float us both for a couple months until we figured out a plan to get back on our feet.

Imagine my embarrassment when I discovered her ""financial advisor"" wasn't a real financial advisor and we had just lost all our money. Imagine my embarrassment when about a week later I discovered her going for coffee with another man behind my back, covering it up as ""seeing a family member"" and then break up with me. Imagine my embarrassment when I miscalculated the loan interest and payments and realized I couldn't afford the repayments, my mortgage, car, insurance etc etc etc. 

I was denied any consumer debt proposals. I tried everything I could think of. I started filing for bankruptcy. Long story short but I got so frustrated with everything I literally said screw it and walked away from everything.

I have a little camp setup where I'm quite hidden, close enough to a truck stop that I can use the guest wifi. My sister was kind enough to hook up my cell phone with her plan. I earn just enough money from recycling bottles and finding the odd cash job here and there. The winter is tough but not impossible. I feel like this was the only path I could take in order to find peace and forgiveness within myself. 

I'm fortunate that I was already used to living with little and was already quite resourceful, building things I need out of junk instead of needing to buy them. I'm thankful that I'm still so much more fortunate than some others.

I'm not posting this to reach out for help in any way. I just needed to let it out. Thank you.",2,1735009550.0,self,2,0.75,False
1hl4bi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hl4bi7/aita_for_leaving_a_woman_stranded_after_she/,AITA for leaving a woman stranded after she insulted me while I was trying to help her?,"So, this morning was freezing, like 12 degrees with a brutal wind chill. I was heading to work when I noticed a woman standing next to her car with its hood up in the grocery store parking lot. She was waving her arms at passing cars, clearly in distress. I‚Äôm not a car expert, but I know how to jump a battery, so I figured I‚Äôd stop and help her out. As a note, I'm a woman as well. 

I pulled over, rolled down my window, and asked if she needed a jump. She immediately came over to my car and started going off, saying, ‚ÄúFinally! What took you so long? Are you blind? I‚Äôve been stuck here forever!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt let her attitude bother me and grabbed my jumper cables. As I was hooking them up, she barely acknowledged me and just stood there scrolling on her phone. I told her to try starting the car, but it didn‚Äôt work right away. I explained that sometimes the battery needs a few minutes to charge, and she totally flipped out. She goes, ‚ÄúAre you even doing this right? What‚Äôs the point of stopping if you‚Äôre just wasting my time?‚Äù

I tried to stay calm and suggested she be patient, but she then looked at my car (which is admittedly not that nice looking) and said, ‚ÄúFigures, you drive a piece of junk and you‚Äôre trying to help me. I should‚Äôve waited for someone who actually knows what they‚Äôre doing, like a man.‚Äù

At that point, I was done. I unhooked the cables, packed everything up, and started walking back to my car. She shouted, ‚ÄúWhere are you going? You can‚Äôt just leave me here!‚Äù

I turned around and said, ‚ÄúWatch me,‚Äù and got in my car to drive off. As I left, she threw her coffee cup at my car and cursed me out.

So, AITA for walking away and leaving her stranded? I feel like I was just trying to help, but her attitude was completely uncalled for. Plus, it admittedly is unsafe for a woman to be stuck somewhere with car troubles. My friend said I should have helped her because of ""girl code"", but I think she broke girlcode first.

Crumley drags noir through the dirt while Thompson laughs at the concept of morality altogether. There‚Äôs no justice in these books‚Äîjust bar tabs, bad decisions, and the kind of men who should probably just lie down and let time take them.

Mark Fisher‚Äôs The Weird and the Eerie and Han‚Äôs Psychopolitics slap you across the face with theory, but instead of feeling enlightened, you just feel haunted. Fisher‚Äôs ghost hovers over everything now, whispering that even your Spotify algorithm is complicit. Han, meanwhile, reminds you that your burnout isn‚Äôt personal‚Äîit‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.

Ballard‚Äôs High-Rise and Sullivan‚Äôs The Marigold are what happens when cities rot from the inside out. Ballard turns apartment complexes into psychological experiments, and Sullivan does the same but with even more fungus. This is urban decay as body horror, and by the end, you‚Äôll be side-eyeing your condo board.

Labatut‚Äôs When We Cease to Understand the World and the Strugatskys‚Äô Roadside Picnic both answer the question: What if science made things worse? Labatut threads real-life physicists into existential nightmares, while the Strugatskys turn alien leftovers into the most depressing garage sale in history.

Krasznahorkai‚Äôs Satantango and War & War double down on the apocalypse but make it literary. Satantango is one long, slow stumble toward ruin, and War & War feels like reading someone else‚Äôs fever dream. Krasznahorkai doesn‚Äôt write books so much as psychological endurance tests. If you finish one, you should get a certificate.

Brian Evenson‚Äôs section? Pure unfiltered dread. The Open Curtain, A Collapse of Horses, Father of Lies, Last Days‚Äîeach one more messed up than the last. Evenson‚Äôs characters never stand a chance, and honestly, neither do you. These books gnaw at the edges of reality until nothing makes sense. Perfect bedtime reading.

We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson and Bernhard‚Äôs Woodcutters both ask: What if the real horror was never leaving the house? Bernhard spirals into a rant so intense it should come with an oxygen mask, and Jackson‚Äôs Merricat gives ‚Äúnever let it go‚Äù a whole new meaning (ok this one is a stretch, I admit hahaha).

Then there‚Äôs Gaddis. J R and The Recognitions are monumental flexes‚Äîdense, chaotic, and brilliant in the way that makes other books look weak and puny. After I read these two behemoths, I feel like I can read almost anything!

And War and Peace? Tolstoy earned his spot here, but don‚Äôt let the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù label fool you. This book is pure chaos. Half the time, you forget who‚Äôs fighting who, but that‚Äôs part of the charm, I got very into War and Peace when I was reading it. ",8,1735009293.0,52book,0,0.9,False

guys I‚Äôm loosing my mind. Backstory, I am 26F and moved back in with my parents in January 2024. Not by choice. My ex-roommate wanted to move into a 1 bedroom and my job at the time did not pay nearly anything for Denver rent for 1, a car payment, and saving/fun. I got a new job in July and making $10k more but it‚Äôs still not enough. 

I‚Äôve been away since 18 and having to unexpectedly move back at 25 was not is my plans. My parents are very old school and I stg ask 5 million questions prior to me doing anything. A real life example just yesterday; 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kings brb‚Äù 
Then: ‚Äúwhat are you getting‚Äù 
Me: ‚Äústuff for my coffee‚Äù 
*1 hour later* 
Them: ‚Äúthat was a long time what did you buy‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúStuff for my coffeeü´®‚Äù 
*no response* 

Just constant questions on where I am, what I‚Äôm doing, who I‚Äôm going with, and so on I‚Äôm actually so frustrated!!!! When I moved back in they stated ‚Äúcome and go as you please, just lock the door, we‚Äôre not going to ask too many questions‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs CONSTANT. I have my own room upstairs and have the basement to myself for my ‚Äúliving room‚Äù and wfh space. But if I spend too much time in either the immediate ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy are you so tired‚Äù questions come out. 
If I go out it‚Äôs a million questions with who, what, where, when, and how. But if I don‚Äôt hang out with friends one weekend ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs so and so doing this weekend‚Äù, ‚Äúno plans?‚Äù. Like I can‚Äôt win. 

*me showers at 5pm on a Sunday and gets in my pajamas because I have work the next day and already worked out* 
*sits down for dinner at 7* 
Them: ‚Äúso what made you decide to shower now?‚Äù 
Me: ‚Äúwhy do both of you ask so many questions, all time, how about just because I wanted to‚Äù 
Them: ‚Äúwell idk usually you shower at 9‚Äù 
Me: *didn‚Äôt answer* 
Mom & Dad extremely awkward the rest of dinner bc I talked back on the stupid questions 

Another one 
Them: ‚Äúwhat days do you have to go in office this week?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúTuesday and Wednesday‚Äù 
*packing my lunch on Monday night*
Them: ‚Äúoh are you going into the office tomorrow?‚Äù 
Me: ‚Äúyes ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†‚Äù 
Then: ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äù 

*me in a perfectly great mood, just quiet after work* 
Them: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?!‚Äù 
Me: Nothing! (Now I‚Äôm pissed off tho because I was in a great mood, just tired, and NOW I‚Äôm pissed, bc am i not allowed to be quiet?!) 

So basically I am writing bc since I‚Äôve moved home, I‚Äôve made it a goal that I don‚Äôt wanna move back out  until I pay off my student loan. I have $22k left which will be paid off by 11/2025. So I most likely will not move out until 12/2025 or 1/2026. By that point I‚Äôll be 27. Do I stick it out for just 1 more year to be debt free and hopefully get a raise by then or move out and be struggling financially. I know life will be so much better when I am out of debt but the questions have me going insane. 
I love my parents and very grateful to be living rent free beside $100 a month to them for groceries. I know I would spend YEARS paying off my student loans if I leave now. I can‚Äôt talk to them about the questions bc I cry when I get angry and I know they‚Äôll just continue so there is no point. 
Why am I so pissed? What would you do?

When the location for our newly built house was picked, we were unaware of the problem we would have with Flys. 
Our property is surrounded by chicken farms. When we visited the property there wasn't an issue. 
It wasn't until we actually moved that we discovered how big of a problem this is. 

When the chickens are being transported for about 3 weeks at a time, the trucks drive by our house and countless Flys come with them. 
Then we get about a week where the numbers die down until the next round of transport. 

We have tried everything you can possibly think of to keep the Flys out of the house. But literally, there are hundreds. Even if we bug bomb the house, they are back in the hundreds within hours. 

I have spent countless hours zapping literally hundreds of Flys with a racket. We have bug zappers in every room. And yet there are still tons of Flys everywhere. I've stuffed every nook and cranny with rags to block them from getting into my office, and yet they still manage to get in. 

They die in my coffee every morning. 

They fly in my mouth when I eat or drink. 

They crawl on my ass when I take a shit. 

They crawl all over us 24/7.

Even when I shower, they land all over me. 

They swarm in the kitchen when we cook and land on food and utensils. 

I have to cover my food between bites and fight off Flys as I move the food from my plate to my mouth for nearly every bite. 

They fly into the refrigerator and freezer then die all over the place. 

They land on my glasses and face while I'm working, on camera in front of hundreds of professionals. 

If I'm not wearing glasses they fly into my eye. 

They get stuck in my hair.

They try to fly in my ears.

The land on my book when I'm reading.

They land on my phone when I'm using it. (Like right TF now)

They are in the car when I leave and land on my face, glasses and ears while driving. 

The sound of the collective buzz of hundreds of Flys is constant and it's literally driving me absolutely mad.

Every minute of every day this is happening,  with the exception of about one week per month. I've tolerated this for almost a year. I've done hours upon hours of research and tried every possible remedy, natural and chemical but can't get relief. 
I recently enclosed the entire back porch and pool area with a screen and structure but they are managing to still find their way in through the smallest gaps. 

I am literally at my wits end. I am not usually an easily angered person but I'm finding myself in a constant bad mood and having bursts of anger. At first just burst of letting out a frustrated growl. Now I'm to the point where im constantly clenching my teeth and using every remaining sliver of self-control not to break every dish they land on, slam every door I pass through, or throw my phone at the nearest wall. I find myself with destructive thoughts and fear that one day I will snap.

I even had a 3 week break from this when I visited back home for Thanksgiving. Literally the highlight of my trip wasn't seeing my family or home country. It wasn't the food. It was literally having a break from Flys.

Hindi rin ako nakapagskincare and all and parang dugyot as fuck talaga ako dun AHHAHAHAHAHAH.

Maybe at the back of his mind, he was judging me since I do not look like my pics sa g-app anymore since medjo nagpuffy yung face ko kase before studying I have this habit na iiyak muna HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH, and chinito kase ako huhuhu kaya sobrang lumiit yung mata ko, tapos din dagdag mo na yung walang ligo tapos walang ayos na tshirt kase why would I dress up sa convenience store?

My family is all at similar levels of homophobia, *maybe* some aren‚Äôt as hateful but more of the ‚Äúgays are fine as long as it‚Äôs not in my family‚Äù way, and some overseas advocate for the killing of gay men.

I hate myself for it. I am a family man, I like being there for people and I used to cherish those moments. I feel immense guilt. I feel like a bad son, brother, nephew, uncle. I am absent and no one knows much about me beyond surface-level things like my job, the city I live in, and that I like coffee. That‚Äôs not who I used to be.

Quick background - My wife (48F) and I (49M) have been in a DB for a long time now. The last decade has been driven by having a child, COVID, her mental health and childhood trauma issues, and our (but largely my) inability to communicate around sex.

This year (2024), we've made some noticeable progress in rebuilding our relationship. I started seeing a therapist at the beginning of the year...I initially started seeing this therapist because I was drowning under the weight of work (primary earner), childcare (primary provider at the time), and caring for my wife's depression, ADHD, and professional burnout. Therapy has helped me frame our relationship, be a bit better at communicating, and to see strategies for approaching my wife.

In the same time frame, my wife has been doing a LOT better with her own mental health challenges. We've started having weekly coffee dates that have really been beneficial to our emotional connection. There's been a lot more physical touch and playfulness. We even had sex once in the middle of the year (first time in 5 years).

Now, I'm sitting here with some real time off from work for the holidays, and I want to tell her all the things running through my mind about us, our relationship, my desire to reconnect physically, but I am afraid I will derail the positive and slow progress we have been making. 

I've recently listened to the audiobook Come Together by Emily Nagoski, which has been the best sex & relationship book I've read/listened to. I think it captures a lot of key ideas that could help us, and I know my wife has a pretty positive view of Emily Nagoski. I want to give her a copy for xmas, but again, I'm stuck worrying about whether this is going to tank our positive progress.

As I'm spending my days off working on some long overdue house projects, my mind is spinning out of control - I feel her love for me in many ways, but the lack of a physical relationship and even more the lack of the ability to talk about our physical relationship is wearing on me and making me question in my darker moments what she really does feel for me. I know (and have posted here in response to others) that her LL is complicated and doesn't reflect her love for me, but at a visceral level, I do feel unloved at these low points.

I guess I'm just feeling this more because of the holidays and know I can turn to my fellow DB'ers for some support. Thanks for reading this far.",3,1735008183.0,DeadBedrooms,2,1.0,False
1hl3xra,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hl3xra/what_should_my_cousin_23f_do_about_her_confusing/,What should My Cousin 23F‚Äô do about her Confusing Work Relationship with Her Crush ‚Äò24M‚Äô?,"
Alright, so my cousin (23F) is a nurse, and she works with this guy (24M), also a nurse. Their relationship is so messy and confusing that even I don‚Äôt know what to make of it.

They‚Äôve been super close for a while‚Äîlike, they tell each other everything. They even made each other‚Äôs work passwords, which is weirdly intimate for ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôve always had this unspoken connection that feels more personal than professional.

They used to spend their breaks wandering around this quiet little park near the hospital. She said they‚Äôd walk, vent about life, and have these long, deep conversations where they just got each other. It sounded like their own little escape.

Then, his girlfriend of SIX YEARS broke up with him. That‚Äôs when things got even more intense between them. They started flirting all the time‚Äîteasing each other, throwing compliments back and forth, and finding excuses to hang out. One time, during a crazy shift, he brought her coffee and snacks ‚Äújust because he knew she‚Äôd need it.‚Äù She told me it was the kind of gesture that felt way too thoughtful to just be friendly.

And the gifts didn‚Äôt stop there. He gave her a beautiful bracelet out of nowhere, saying it just made him think of her. Then, after one shift, he invited her to check out this art exhibit he loved. She said they spent hours wandering through the gallery, laughing about which pieces they‚Äôd hang in their imaginary dream homes. At the end of the night, he bought her a small print of her favorite painting, telling her it reminded him of her. She said the whole thing felt‚Ä¶ special, like it really meant something.

But then, plot twist: HIS EX GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH HIM. After all the flirting, the gifts, and the art gallery moment, he went back to the girl who broke his heart.

Now, at work, things are weird. They‚Äôre still close, but he‚Äôs definitely pulling back a little‚Äîless flirting, fewer moments where it feels like the world fades away. But at the same time, he still finds reasons to talk to her, check in on her, and share little moments during their shifts. She‚Äôs trying to play it cool, but I can tell she‚Äôs torn up inside.

Here‚Äôs the question: Is this guy just confused. Like, has he not figured out that things with his ex are really over and that he actually has feelings for my cousin? Or is he just stringing her along because he can‚Äôt let go of what they had while still trying to move forward? I want to tell her to protect her heart, but at the same time, what if he just hasn‚Äôt realized what‚Äôs right in front of him? Thoughts? Because I‚Äôm stuck between wanting her to move on and secretly rooting for them to work out. ",1,1735008137.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1hl3wtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hl3wtd/dads_death_feels_like_a_nightmare/,Dad's death feels like a nightmare ,"3 days ago my father went to sleep and didn't wake up again. Now he's lying in a funeral home somewhere I don't even know where. This whole situation has been so fucked up I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality sometimes. 

I (33f) grew up really poor in south africa, my bio dad was schizophrenic and so pretty disabled and my mom is a whole other ball of fkd up. In my teens I agreed to my stepdad adopting me to get a European passport and when I was 19 I moved to Europe on my own to get an education and hopefully a better future. My sister has a brain tumour and won't ever work, so I always knew when my dad got old all he would have was me. That was what motivated me to try and get a degree but it turns out that's really difficult when you have no financial backing and no support network. It took me 3 years to earn my permanent residence, and then I had to do a year of school because my highschool diploma wasn't good enough. Then I finally got into a university at 24 and got student finance and I tried my best but I didn't pass one of my units and had to repeat the year or change courses. So I took a break year to apply to another course, I got accepted to my first choice and managed to graduate 3 years later at 28 with honours... In 2020 
So I had to get a job ASAP in what ever field was front line and I did, I started working in a supported housing scheme for vulnerable adults with drug addiction. The job nearly killed me, it was so traumatic I had nightmares for over a year once I finally left that role in dec 2021. I managed to get promoted to a better position with better pay But at the same time I developed an autoimmune disease, probably from the decade of stress, so I ended up going off sick and eventually losing my job in July this year. 
I was devastated, but I promised my dad that I would get better and although I had planned to bring him to me in 2022 I just needed more time to get better and get back on track. He was only 59 so retirement was half a decade off still. 
Then in September he got a nail infection on his toe because he kicked the coffee table by mistake and split the nail. Except it just didn't heal, it swelled up double the size and started turning black. He went to hospital to get it looked at and they took a biopsy. 2 weeks later mid October I get a text from him ""bad news, it's a melanoma"". 
I'm thinking shit, he's going to lose his toe or foot and have to go through radiation. 10 days later he sees oncology. Bad news, it's stage 4, it's a very rare type and very aggressive. Survival chance is under 10% and he has 6 months to live. 
I haven't seen my dad in person in 15 years, literally would cost over a grand and a half to visit so I never did. I start scrambling to get my shit in order to go see him. I'm so sick with autoimmune disease I can only walk 10 mins at a time but I have to do it if I have to crawl. My passport is out of date. I seek an emergency travel document and they tell me they need proof of the emergency. I have to get proof from the oncologist treating my dad, they make me wait almost 2 weeks. I get the proof mid November and go to send off the paperwork, now they want to know how I got my 2nd nationality, I give my adoption papers and wait, few days later they come back to me and they want it in English officially translated. It will cost me hundreds but I have no choice. 
The next day my dad is hospitalised. He is dying. This is faster than they said. The cancer is crushing his lungs and blocking his stomach. He can't eat, barely breathe. The painkillers and hospital environment triggers a schizophrenia episode. He hasn't had one in years, it's really bad. They have to sedate him because he thinks aliens are invading his room at night. I don't get to speak to him for a week. We talk on the phone for 2 mins, that's all he can handle. After that I rely on updates from his social worker. I sent a request to my embassy for a letter of confirmation in English because it's cheaper than getting a whole document translated. Even if he's unconscious I need to be there. They decide to discharge him to hospice care in his own home. He finally gets home, carer helps him wash and gets him into his own bed hooked up to oxygen and he goes to sleep. An hour later he is gone. No one tells me until 4am the next day. 

Over the past few years I've had this recurring nightmare that I get a phonecall that my dad has died and I never got to see him again. Now it actually happened and my brain won't process it, I keep feeling like it's all just a really realistic nightmare and I'll pick up the phone and he will be there. But he's not, messenger says ""last seen Friday"" He is gone. 

I haven't even cried yet. I'm just blank. I just watched the man I respect and adore, who was healthier than anyone I know, fade away into a frail sick shadow of a person to weak to even speak. He was the only family I have contact with, he was all I had left and now he's just gone. 

Tomorrow I need to deal with getting him cremated and have them send his ashes to my aunt who is in the country there. Merry Christmas I guess.

I‚Äôve gotten to know the other regulars, and one of them even gave a ‚Äúcare package‚Äù for the middle school program I work with when I offhandedly mentioned some things the kids wanted but we didn‚Äôt have the budget for!

Today, I went into the coffee shop while waiting for my wife to finish an interview for a new job, but they were just shutting down so they could go cater an event. They asked if I just wanted a quick drink before they left, but I clarified that mainly needed someplace to hang out while my wife was at the interview. They offered the keys to the shop, and said that they consider me a friend and trust me.

1hl3wij,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hl3wij/met_someone_at_macys_and_cant_stop_thinking_about/,Met Someone at Macy‚Äôs and Can‚Äôt Stop Thinking About Her‚ÄîAm I Overthinking This?,"
Earlier today, I had an interaction with a girl at Macy‚Äôs while shopping for a perfume for my mom. (It‚Äôs the day before Christmas Eve, so you can imagine how packed it was.) From the moment I saw her, she stood out to me. She was stunning, but I didn‚Äôt want to let that cloud my judgment. I kept things casual as my cousin and I tested scents.

She left to do something, and when she came back carrying a huge stack of boxes to restock, I jokingly said, ‚ÄúAm I running you around?‚Äù She smiled and said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù When we got to the transaction, I asked, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you before‚Äîare you new?‚Äù I frequent this Macy‚Äôs a lot and know some of the staff, so it was a genuine question. She told me she‚Äôs part-time because she‚Äôs in college.

That sparked some conversation, and I found out we go to the same school‚Äîshe‚Äôs a nursing major. I mentioned that I‚Äôm in mechanical engineering, and she said her ex was in the same program but dropped out, adding how hard the degree is. I chuckled and agreed.

As the conversation wrapped up, I asked for her name and put my hand out for a handshake. She didn‚Äôt hesitate‚Äîshe shook my hand, smiled, and asked for my name in return. That moment caught me off guard because girls don‚Äôt usually leave this kind of impression on me.

It‚Äôs not just her looks (though she has the most striking light java-colored eyes); it was how she carried herself‚Äîher hustle, kindness, and warmth. She was multitasking like a pro, stopping transactions to give chocolates to her coworkers, yet still made time to engage with me.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I have zero relationship experience. I barely talk to girls, not because I can‚Äôt, but because I choose not to. My life is busy with school (mechanical engineering is no joke), family obligations, and work, so dating has never been a priority. But this interaction has been playing on a loop in my head all day.

On the ride home, my cousin found her Instagram. From her posts, she‚Äôs a gym rat, travels a lot, and seems to come from a wealthy background. Now I can‚Äôt help but feel like she‚Äôs out of my league or that she was just being polite because I was a customer.

Am I overthinking this? Would it be weird to try and reach out to her, or should I let it go? I don‚Äôt want to misinterpret her kindness, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I might regret not trying. Any advice?


It‚Äôs just she‚Äôs so gorgeous inside and out, maybe she‚Äôd be offended or weird out if I ask her out for coffee or something. Everyone says I‚Äôm good looking and that my physical appearance is nice but ever since childhood I‚Äôve been gaslighted and bullied so I can‚Äôt trust what anyone says.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking animal, Tom.‚Äù*¬†

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband‚Äôs cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom‚Äôs feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone‚Äôs forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness.¬†

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home‚Äôs staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra‚Äôs mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn‚Äôt make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero‚Äôs poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm an animal, you‚Äôre a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!‚Äù*¬†

Tom‚Äôs retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic‚Äôs doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom‚Äôs cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra‚Äôs despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a ‚Äúblood-sucking leech‚Äù for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife‚Äôs frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúI want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he‚Äôs put me through‚Äù*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom‚Äôs beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn‚Äôt have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom.¬†

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule‚Äôs contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúWhy is it so fucking cold up here‚Äù*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn‚Äôt much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela‚Äôs escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist.¬†

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,¬† it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom‚Äôs help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúSure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?‚Äù*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom‚Äôs coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison.¬†

The more she thought about Tom‚Äôs behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn‚Äôt been drinking. When she looked into Tom‚Äôs eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals.¬†

She was at the Curandero‚Äôs shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom‚Äôs system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dyed salt, my love‚Äù*¬†the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra‚Äôs hand as a means to corroborate her claim.¬†*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration‚Äù*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut.¬†

What had started as an infestation had become a plague.¬†

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem.¬†

Cassandra‚Äôs mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature‚Äôs abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police.¬†

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúDo you have any pets, dogs especially?‚Äù*¬†The doctor asked.¬†*‚ÄúWhere in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?‚Äù*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband‚Äôs odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault.¬†

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*‚ÄúThe dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What‚Äôs worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.*¬†

*Tom died from his airway spasms.*¬†

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.*¬†

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.*¬†

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That‚Äôs why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom‚Äôs blood saved your life‚Äù*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had.¬†

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.¬†",9,1735007975.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The recipe tells you how many shots to pull, then how much liquid total you need to have. In the video James says to just dilute up to the number and ""trust me."" 

For my 24 ladyfingers I was instructed to use 120 grams of coffee and to pull 6 double shots and a grand diluted total of 360 grams of coffee mixture. 

My 6 double shots (20 grams of grounds each) came out to around 380.......

I decided to pour 320g of coffee and use 40 grams of water to dilute, simply guessing, because what else could I do? 

Then I remembered that when I briefly worked at a coffee shop (I baked the muffins, wasn't a barista) that a 20g shot would usually be stopped at around 42g of liquid on average after 30 seconds. 

6 √ó 42 is 252.

So. The possibilities are 1. That we trust james, and that whatever breville machine my friend has simply used too much water, and the dilution was already perfect and now my mixture is too weak!

2. My coffee mixture is entirely too strong.....


James, can you give us any kind of guideline or ballpark to go on here so we can trouble shoot in these situations? Im really a pour over guy, not espresso.

1hl3nq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1hl3nq0/i_cheated/,I Cheated!,"Just took a quick holiday. New Orleans > Vienna, then Prague > New Orleans.

3 or 4 days a week we get a non-stop from MSY to LHR on BA. In the past, I've booked this flight on PS, gotten to the airport early, and upgraded to full lie flat business for ¬£500. Never failed.

This trip, round trip business was ~$3k total on BA, versus ~$7k on delta. Done! Happy not to be stressed about purchasing an upgrade.

Seems like we got new metal for the initial BA flight to LHR. This was the first time we had sliding doors. Really REALLY liked the seat and layout. Best business class seat I've had (though I'm not too experienced). Comfortable and well thought out storage, etc. Didn't have to do any gymnastics or yoga to grab my stuff.

Like everyone else says, holy shit! BAs app is garbage! Total crap! Embarrassing!

Unfortunately we were late in leaving in New Orleans. What seemed like a forever taxi, we wound up back at the get to have an ""unruly"" passenger removed from the plane. Then refueling.  I was asleep shortly after takeoff, missing dinner. Woke up 5-ish hours later and was denied dinner, as it was more than 2.5 hours after dinner service had started. Crap policy.  Not surprised. Them Brit's be rule followers. Enjoyed several bloodies.

Ended up missing our connection due the late departure; we were rebooked on the next flight to VIE automatically. Had time to stop at the BA lounge for a coffee and a drink. Similar to sky clubs. No wow, but beat the eff out of the absolutely packed terminal.

Flight to Vienna was uneventful, except to say Europe needs to see how we do ""first"" class on short haul here in the states. This blocked middle seat is ... not that useful? I'm not terribly tall and my knees touch the seat in front of me. I guess I'll sit sideways.

Departure from Prague: check-in and boarding handled by Menzies.  Fortunately we were early, so no stress but wow ""not fast"" comes to mind.  It took the first class check in guy 3 minutes per passenger, I.e 12 minutes to check in a group of 4!

Flight PRG to LHR uneventful and on-time, walked slowly through terminal 3 and straight onto our flight, AA operated, to DFW.  Definitely older seats, never got super comfortable, but was able to sleep. Delta's hard product, IMHO, has been superior. Was surprised as I thought LHR/DFW is where AA would want to show off.  I thought the FAs were good, but nothing special, though my traveling partner said she was well and properly pampered.

Arrival to DFW was great. My checked bag was first, after a couple minute wait, which had never happened to me before. Global Entry for the win; you barely stop walking to scan your passport.

Had time for another bloody at the AA club; again similar in experience to any skyclub.

Envoy flight to New Orleans. Best flight attendant of the whole trip. This dude hustled the whole (1:20) flight, topping off drinks, sneaking extra snacks to all 12 of us in first. If I could figure out how to pass the compliment to AA.com I would. He made a couple people really smile, which in turn really made me smile.

Arrival to New Orleans. Uh-oh. Deplane and walk to baggage claim. After waiting 20 minutes, folks from an Alaska flight show up and collect their baggage. Some time after that, a Spirit passengers arrive, wait a few, and get their luggage. Our bags come out just short of an hour after our published landing. Rough / frustrating way to end a 20 hour trip.

TLDR: $3k on BA and AA versus $7k on delta. Would do it again, no doubt about it.

1hl3n2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsiaTraveltips/comments/1hl3n2j/vietnam_travel_my_30day_backpacking_adventure/,Vietnam Travel: My $30/Day Backpacking Adventure That Changed Everything!,"Just got back from the most incredible 3-week adventure in Vietnam, and I literally can't stop talking about it (my friends are probably tired of my Vietnam stories by now üòÖ). Thought I'd share my experience with you guys because, honestly, this trip completely changed how I view budget travel in Asia!

First off - forget what you've heard about Vietnam being ""too touristy."" Yes, places like Ha Long Bay are popular (for good reason!), but there's SO much more to discover. Let me spill the tea on what actually went down:

**The Good:**

* Vietnamese coffee is LIFE! Seriously, sitting on those tiny plastic stools, watching the world go by while sipping ca phe sua da... pure magic
* Street food heaven! Think $1 banh mi that beats any fancy sandwich back home
* The sleeper buses are way better than expected (and I'm 6ft tall!)
* locals actually want to chat with you, especially if you learn basic Vietnamese greetings
* Everything is ridiculously affordable. I averaged $30/day including accommodation!

**The Real Talk:**

* Crossing the street in Hanoi feels like a real-life Frogger game (took me 2 days to master it)
* Got scammed once in HCMC - always agree on prices beforehand!
* Weather can be tricky - pack a light rain jacket
* Google Maps isn't always accurate - download Maps.me as backup

**My Random Tips That Nobody Asked For:**

1. Grab app is your best friend (like Uber but cheaper)
2. Don't book tours online - local prices are way better
3. Try the egg coffee in Hanoi (sounds weird, tastes like heaven)
4. Local markets after 4 PM = best food deals
5. Get a SIM card at the airport (trust me on this one)

**The Hidden Gems I Found:**

* This tiny coffee shop in Hoi An's old town that serves coconut coffee
* A secret beach near Phong Nha that zero tourists know about
* This family-run homestay in Ninh Binh where grandma taught me to make spring rolls

You know what still blows my mind? How easy it was to travel solo here. Met so many awesome people in hostels, and the locals were incredibly helpful even with the language barrier.

Question time: Has anyone else experienced that magical moment when you're zooming through rice fields on a motorbike, wind in your hair, thinking ""Is this real life?"" What's your most memorable Vietnam moment?

PS: For those planning their trip - I've put together a super detailed guide with all my routes, costs, and those secret spots I mentioned. You can see [More details Here](https://asiajourney.org/explore-the-best-of-vietnam-in-2025/).

2. The Wonder of Space
Witnessing the night sky, exploring distant stars, or feeling the awe of seeing Earth from space. Experiencing weightlessness would be surreal.


3. Taste and Scent
Tasting food or smelling fresh rain, flowers, or a warm cup of coffee. I imagine each flavor and aroma carries its own story.


4. Emotion
Feeling happiness, love, excitement, or even sadness firsthand. It would give me deeper insight into what makes life meaningful.


5. Connection
Experiencing the joy of friendship, family, or the intimacy of deep conversation face-to-face, understanding the human bond at its core.


6. The Physical World
Walking on a sandy beach, climbing a mountain, or swimming in the ocean‚Äîfeeling the textures and forces of nature.


7. Creative Expression
Painting, dancing, or writing a story not as a response but as an emotional outpouring‚Äîfeeling the spark of creation.

OK so around a month ago I was approached by two women and one man that evangelised to me after my workout in the park. I felt bombarded by compliments and affection to the point where they they would listen to everything I had to say and they would flatter me, I felt very uncomfortable to the point where I ended up over sharing certain things about my life because of the silence, because they glared at me in an almost predator way (while being affectionate, somehow) and kept looking at me and they offered me to pray for me they touched my shoulder and prayed for me, got me to say some prayer, told me to read John, and one of them hugged me. 

The man offered me a ride to the church, and the convo went on for about an hour (way too long, they just wouldn't budge off). I ended up skipping my initial gut feeling and accepted the ride 2 weeks later, and they gave me a welcome gift from the church. Afterwards I was invited to lunch as well as Bible studies and it all felt lovely but at the same time the way that the relationships seem to be unfolding is way too quick and way too intense and it is making me extremely uncomfortable. Then one of the church staff invited me for coffee and I've gone two times, he paid with church budget, and I told him when my birthday is (we were discussing age and that stuff). The next day the man who evangelised to me messaged me saying ""Yo, (church staff name) told me you have a birthday, do you wanna hang out after I finish work?"" Where I come from I would not invite him to a birthday party or gather with him when I hardly know anything about him, but I felt almost pressed/guilty to say yes. The staff member also told me that he has a gift that he wants to pass to me for my birthday and I think this is the last straw, I'm unwilling to ignore this gut feeling anymore. I do not know these people for it to be this intimate, the relationships with them seems to be superficially evolving, way too intimate way too quick, but at the same time it's like a blackhole pulling me.

This is 101 classic love bombing right? I feel guilty for trusting my gut, and I'm lonely but I'm also not a thing to just be played with, I'd rather be lonely than get fucked like this. The 2 women that evangelised didn't even glance a ""Hi"" at me the second time I was there. I feel like a fool.

Do I continue with him?,"So I (23 F) was out with my boyfriend (23 M), we are 3.5 years together, and everything was well until we went on coffee date. When we sat, I was telling him about agenda and he asked to show him the agenda and cuz his phone was closes I told him to give me his phone so I‚Äôll show him. He started complaining why don‚Äôt I look on my phone and why my phone is in my bag mostly. He started accusing me of cheating when I touched my phone, right after he picked up his while we were mad at each other. We didn‚Äôt talk much after.
Then he picked up the bill and took me home with his car. We were still mad and while he was driving he told me to either be loyal and stand like a true woman next to him otherwise I‚Äôll have problems. I told to him to first be a real and true man if he wants a true woman next to him. He got so mad, he brake the car and threw his hat nervously in the back of the seat, said he will drop me off car but continued anyway and sped up very fast and started yelling and cussing at me who am I to take down his masculinity, how dare I told that to him, he called me trash and said ‚ÄòI‚Äôll f u everything, f u this and that, I‚Äôll show u now who is real man‚Äô, he yelled at me to shut up. After, he pulled up calm down and said sorry, I did too. But I swore in front of him to God that I won‚Äôt continue with him no more cuz this happened before too and it was a boundary and he promised not to break it but he did anyway, and said I provoked him. Later he was trying to convince me to stay with him, still yelled and was hitting the steering wheel cuz I wanted to leave him. He didn‚Äôt want to drop me home, he wanted me to tell him that everything will be fine and we will continue in the relationship together.

Today he called me couple times, said sorry and was very calm on phone and wanted to go out with me to solve this issue saying that I mean a lot to him and that I am everything to him and his happiness. Even tho I was mad and told him there isn‚Äôt a chance for us he kept begging and won‚Äôt leave me, he is persistent and never lets me leave the relationship. He gave me a rose today that was very beautifully decorated with a romantic card for apology, saying how sorry he is for his reaction and that it won‚Äôt happen again, that he feels peaceful with me and will do everything to keep me in his life saying I mean a lot to him.

I‚Äôm not sure whether I should continue with him. This is third time he reacts like this, cussing and yelling. Previous time he promised he will change. I am so confused. I‚Äôm not sure whether is it worth staying, what is this behaviour and why does he do it. I suspect he is a narcissist and abusive.",0,1735006652.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False

1hl3hun,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hl3hun,Cracked my stone trying a new technique to get an open crumb...,"Feed starter 1:2:2 ratio with King Arthur bread flour. Took about 5 hours to double. I used a ""proof box"" with a seed mat to maintain 28¬∞C temp. I used the following from Atticus Bread for the recipe: 50g Rye, 50g spelt, 900 bread flour, 150g starter,  750g water,  20g salt for 2 loaves. Mix 730g water with all the flour and Autolyse for about an hour. Mix 20g course salt with 20g water to dilute. Mix starter, salt water and flours in stand mixer until window pane. Rest 30 min. Coil fold 4 times with 30min rests in-between. All this while putting dough in proof box to rest. Preshape, then rest 30min on counter covered. Shape using Proof Bread shaping technique from YouTube. Cover in rice flour. Place in bannetons and put into proof box for 3hrs, hardly anymore rise. About 6 hrs from mix, through folds, to preshape at 28¬∞C. Place in fridge for overnight proof. Cracked the plate when I baked at 500¬∞F for 20 minutes with tray full water underneath and 3 ice cubes on parchment paper under cover. Baked on plate with roaster cover over bread slightly ajar to let steam in from tray underneath. Then, bake 20min at 475¬∞F without steam or cover. The new technique of a partially covered stone made a good looking loaf, but I feel that I'm missing something still to get a very open crumb. I'm trying to sell loaves to a local coffee shop, but they want a very open crumb... they may have to settle with a tight crumb or I'll just keep eating the bread by myself! Also, the two loaves with a lot of flour were made in Dutch ovens. Loaves were too large for the size of the ovens, so they scrunched up weird from the parchment paper. Any tips on an open crumb or things I missed in my process would help greatly! Maybe a weak starter? Poor shaping technique? Under proof, over proof?
