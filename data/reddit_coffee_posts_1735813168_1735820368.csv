This coffee is roasted by @driftawaycoffee based in Brooklyn, NY.

The dry aroma of the coffee is quite sweet and floral and the brew was full of oranges, nectarine sweetness and a bit of lemonade finish. Overall a very balanced and fantastic cup.

Also add a thermos or something so one can take the tea on a journey. Another thing you could do is utilize plants already in the game, so they have more purpose (berries and azelia (i forgot how to spell it)) This way you could create special tea unique to the game.

The Last-Minute Genius – Spends weeks strategizing and 30 minutes executing... because brilliance strikes at the 11th hour, obviously.

The Phantom Approver – Ghosts every email, but magically reappears two hours after the deadline with just a quick revision.

The Jack-of-All-Trades – Fixing spreadsheets, troubleshooting tech issues, and somehow organizing birthday cakes.

The Slide Warrior – Starts a presentation with, this is a draft, because PowerPoint decided to crash right before the big meeting.

The Urgent-But-Not-Important Manager – Everything’s high priority until the deadline passes, and suddenly no one remembers why it was a big deal.

And then there’s us, the survivors, wearing our deadline war scars proudly... until someone drops the next “urgent” email in our inbox.

But the deadline circus teaches us resilience, creativity, and the fine art of staying just functional enough to get it all done. Plus, who doesn't love the adrenaline rush of surviving a chaotic deadline yet again?

[The narrated version is uploaded to my youtube.](https://youtu.be/XVKqqekvaB8?si=ny5TyTcLI7rWYMXN) I've just started with that so any support is super helpfull! 


Winning the lottery is supposed to be the ultimate dream, right? At least, that’s what I thought until I won it. Now, sitting here alone in the dark, with the echoes of my hollow mansion ringing in my ears, I can only wonder: was it a dream, or a curse? Let me tell you my story, and then maybe you can decide for yourself.

It started on New Year’s Day. I’d woken up groggy from a night of cheap champagne and pizza with my friends. Just a regular guy, living paycheck to paycheck in a shoebox apartment, I hadn’t even planned to stay up to watch the ball drop. But around 11:50, I remembered the scratch-off lottery tickets someone had given me as a gag Christmas gift. They were lying on the coffee table, half covered by empty beer cans and leftover takeout containers.

I scratched them idly while the countdown blared on TV. The first one? Nothing. The second? A measly $10 prize. But the third, oh, the third changed everything. At first, I thought I was seeing it wrong, maybe still buzzed from the champagne. But I wasn’t. I checked the numbers again, and again. Each time, they matched.

“Holy… I won?” I muttered aloud, barely able to believe it. My cat, Mittens, meowed lazily from her perch, completely unimpressed. The grand prize was $50 million. Fifty. Million. Dollars.

I’d never won more than a couple of bucks on a scratch-off before, and now here I was, holding a golden ticket that promised to change my life forever. For a moment, I was frozen in disbelief. Then I jumped up and screamed, “I’m rich!” Mittens bolted under the couch in terror.




The first sign that things weren’t going to go as planned came almost immediately.

I called the lottery office the next morning, shaking with excitement. After some verification, they confirmed that I’d won. But the lady on the phone hesitated. “You’ll want to stay discreet about this,” she advised, her voice low. “Winning this kind of money… it can attract a lot of, uh, attention.”

I didn’t really understand what she meant at the time. I figured she was just talking about greedy relatives or scammers. But as the days went by, her words started to echo ominously in my head.


---

The first few weeks were pure euphoria. I took the lump sum payout, about $30 million after taxes, and quit my crappy office job on the spot. My boss, who’d been riding me for months, didn’t even get a notice. I bought myself a luxury car, a sprawling mansion, and every gadget I’d ever wanted. For once, it felt like I was finally living.

But even in the midst of my newfound wealth, little things began to nag at me. It started with the calls. At first, it was just the expected flood of “congratulations” from old acquaintances, distant relatives, and so-called friends who’d fallen off my radar years ago. Then came the strangers, people I’d never met, claiming to be in dire need of money. They sent long, emotional emails and left desperate voicemails begging for help. I ignored them, thinking they’d eventually stop.

They didn’t.

One evening, about a month after I’d claimed my prize, I came home to find someone standing in my driveway. It was a middle-aged man, dressed in a tattered coat and holding a crumpled piece of paper.

“Please,” he said, stepping toward me as I got out of my car. “My daughter’s sick. I’ve been trying to contact you. I just need $10,000 to pay for her surgery.”

I froze, my hand hovering over the car door. “How did you find me?”

His face twisted into a mixture of anger and desperation. “I don’t have time for games. You’re a millionaire. You can help us. Why won’t you help us?”

I didn’t answer. I just got back in my car and called the police. By the time they arrived, the man was gone, but his crumpled note was on the ground. It wasn’t a plea for help. It was a death threat.




After that, I started getting paranoid. I hired security for the house and tried to keep a low profile, but the damage was already done. My name and face were plastered all over the news as the lucky winner, and no amount of privacy measures could erase that. People kept showing up, some with sob stories, others with accusations that I owed them money for reasons I couldn’t even comprehend. They camped outside my house, followed me to the grocery store, and even started harassing my family and friends.

But the worst of it wasn’t the strangers. It was the way my friends started looking at me. At first, they were happy for me, cheering me on as I treated them to dinners and vacations. But over time, their attitudes changed. They stopped inviting me to hang out unless I was footing the bill, and their jokes about my wealth started to feel pointed and bitter.

“You’ve changed,” my best friend, Dan, said one night after I refused to lend him $100,000 for a “business investment.”

“Of course I’ve changed,” I snapped. “I’m not a walking ATM, Dan.”

He left in a huff, and we haven’t spoken since.



It was around this time that the nightmares began. At first, they were vague and disjointed images of strangers breaking into my house, their faces blurred and featureless. But as the weeks went on, they became more vivid. I’d dream of people standing over my bed, whispering my name in the dark. I’d wake up drenched in sweat, convinced that someone was in the room with me.

One night, I woke up to find the patio door wide open. My security cameras didn’t show anyone coming in or out, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I started sleeping with a knife under my pillow, but it didn’t help. The dreams kept coming, and so did the unease.



The final straw came about three months after I’d won. By this point, I was barely leaving the house. My once glamorous mansion felt like a prison, its vast, empty rooms echoing with every creak and groan. I was sitting in the living room, staring blankly at the TV, when I heard a knock at the door.

I froze. It was nearly midnight, and I wasn’t expecting anyone. The knock came again, louder this time. Gripping the knife I’d started carrying everywhere, I crept to the window and peered outside.

A man was standing on my porch, his face obscured by the shadow of his hood. He wasn’t moving, just standing there like he was waiting for something. My heart pounded in my chest as I backed away from the window, my hands shaking.

“Go away!” I shouted through the door. “I’m calling the police!”

There was a long silence. Then, he spoke.

“You can’t escape us,” he said, his voice low and menacing. “You took the money. Now it’s time to pay.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I locked myself in the bathroom and called 911. By the time the police arrived, the man was gone, leaving no trace behind.



That was two weeks ago, and things have only gotten worse since then. I keep seeing shadows moving in the corners of my vision, hearing faint whispers when I’m alone. My once bright future has turned into a waking nightmare, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched.

I tried to give the money away, hoping it would end the madness. I donated millions to charity, gave my family generous gifts, even tried burning some of the cash. But it didn’t help. The whispers didn’t stop, and neither did the feeling of dread that follows me everywhere I go.

Last night, I woke up to find a message scrawled on my bedroom wall in what looked like blood: “It’s not about the money. It’s about you.”

I don’t know who, or what, is doing this to me, but I can’t take it anymore. The lottery didn’t make me rich. It ruined my life. And now, as I sit here, writing this with trembling hands, I can only wonder: was winning really just a stroke of luck? Or was it something else entirely?

The shadows are moving again. I can hear them whispering my name.

If you’re reading this, and you ever find yourself holding a winning lottery ticket, do yourself a favor. Rip it up. Burn it. Do whatever you have to do to get rid of it. Because some prizes aren’t worth winning.

My question was, is the caffeine content shown on the spreadsheet the total amount of caffeine before the pod has been extracted?

Which got me wondering if after extraction, those caffiene numbers might be a lot less?

The only reason I ask...I'm getting no where near the hit of caffeine even using 2x Kaazar pods. In comparison to a small/medium Costa or even 2 teaspoons of general Nescafé instant coffee!?

So I'm trying to figure out the reason for this. I appreciate there might be an adjustment period so maybe I need to just stick with the pods for longer, or maybe my previous caffiene tolerance was to high I'm not sure. 

I've also read things like with a coffee shop using 18g of coffee, compared to say 5g in a pod...can we really expect the same or similar amounts of caffeine from these pods, even if we double them up like I am?

Coffee taste was still good. [https://imgur.com/a/c4fzn8v](https://imgur.com/a/c4fzn8v)",4,1735817264.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I have been questioning my sexuality for the longest time, and finally decided to try to be sure about myself. I have always felt this undeniable attraction to women in general, but was never really brave enough to make a move on this feeling. Finally, I am looking to connect with probably bicurious/lesbians purely for hookups only so that I can explore myself.

But other than that, if you wanna be girl besties, I am so down for it anytime! I worship and dig for female friendships, and they are so underrated. We could just catch up over a coffee, go for a movie, or just shopping haul, or try new things like ice skating, hiking sounds good too, or we could sit on a park bench and yap for hours, I really don’t mind. There are no strong no’s for me except commitment, I am not looking for that right now. Also, I don’t like anything hardcore at all, I am more of a softy vanilla type of person. I really hope this works, and if you found any terminology wrong, I am sorry in advance because I am not that aware about everything yet, my bad.

p.s. this might not be the most appropriate reddit to post this, but the hookup scenes for lesbians is not much exposed out there, and I have no idea whatsoever if there’s any thread for lesbian hookups focusing on Edmonton. If there’s any other active place to discuss this please let me know, TIA.",0,1735816459.0,LesbianActually,0,0.5,False

1hrrfro,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hrrfro/the_nowak/,The Nowak,"It's been 3 days. Three whole days of constant paranoia that I'm being watched. Three whole days of having to look over my shoulder every minute to be sure it isn't following me. I'm being watched. I'm being followed.

Three days ago I woke up to my alarm as usual. 6:30 am. The English winter weather is wet and cold. Regardless, I get up to make my coffee and start the day ahead. Afternoon rolled around and I left out to meet my friend group. We'd made plans a week prior to this and were going to Jacobs house. Jacob was an odd guy - the nerdy type. But in a good way. He's a good guy. We get there and it's me, Jacob, Dave, Tamiyo and Kai. Dave was an eccentric stereotypically gay kid. Red and black hair, however he was a nice dude. Tamiyo was more on the quiet side, he went along with whatever the rest of us said and did and minded his own business. Kai was the only girl among us, a headstrong character who was seemingly intimidating, but on the inside would get excited every time she saw a cute kitten. My name is Austyn.

As the hours go by we play numerous games and enjoy ourselves late into the night. We decide to stay over at Jacobs, as we had all been drinking and were too intoxicated to drive home. Kai suddenly stands up and announces that she feels sick, and is about to throw up. Jacob helped her out of the door and we watch them go into the bathroom and shut the door behind them. I continue laughing with Tamiyo and Dave about the movie we'd been watching. About half an hour goes by and Kai and Jacob had still not come out of the bathroom. I get up from the floor, leaving my friends to check up on Kai. Maybe she was more ill than we thought. I knock on the door.

""Kai?"" There was no answer.

I knock again.

""Kai are you okay?""

Still no answer. I'm concerned. The door wasn't locked, so I turn the handle and open to door to enter the bathroom.

It was empty. My panic only grew as I see the window open the curtains flapping aggressively in the wind. I run to the windowsill and look outside. What I saw will forever haunt me.

Jacob's  severed head, veins bulging and eyes casted over a sickly shade of white, mouth frozen in horror. Kai was nowhere to be found.

I feel sick. I stumble away from the window in shock at the horrid sight. My vision was blurring as I frantically made my way back to the bedroom to tell Dave and Tamiyo what I had just seen. To my surprise they had seemingly fallen asleep in their sleeping bags. My mind was shrouded with fear as I scream at them to wake up. I launch myself onto Tamiyo, shaking him.

Thud.

Tamiyo's head rolls out from beneath me.

Veins bulging.
Eyes cloudy.
The same horrified expression.

I shriek in madness at what I was seeing. This wasn't happening, surely?

With tears streaming down my face I turn Dave over onto his side. His head stays in one place. Decapitated.

All three of them.

I fumble for my phone as I run out of the house, attempting to call the police about what I had just discovered.

As I am typing the number I hear my name being called from behind me. I turn around to see Kai and a wave of emotions come over me as I run to hug her.

""Kai! Oh my god... Jacob... They're all...""

I struggle to find my words. This whole experience was just too surreal to simply explain. I pull back from the embrace and resume calling the police.

""Just... just let me call the police okay? I-""

My phone cracked. It turned off.

""What the fuck!?""

Kai grabs my shoulder and I turn around to see thise same cloudy eyes. The bulging veins. However kai wasn't decapitated.

She was smiling.

""Run.""

I ran as fast as my legs could possibly take me. The alcohol wearing off out of pure adrenaline. At first I thought that there was a possibility I could have hallucinate this whole ordeal but feeling the shards of glass from my cracked phone screen dig into my fingers gave me the reality check I never wanted. I run, I run, I run. I don't stop.

I can't leave my house.
I can't leave my room.
She's watching me.
I can see her.
I can see her.
I can see her.

I look up.

I have been training pretty steadily for 1.5 years now, and completed my first half marathon this past fall. I’m proud of my accomplishment and have resumed training in Nov/Dec by maintaining 20-25 mpw with 5 runs per week. My spouse doesn’t want me to step up to a marathon due to a variety of issues that I’ve been trying to work around. 

Usually time is the biggest factor but I’ve tried to make my schedule flexible and seamless by waking up a few hours early and returning from run before kids get up. I pack lunches, make breakfast, coffee, all the things. 

Next issue: safety. I hate treadmills and therefore run a route on roads with limited access to sidewalks. Some low traffic neighborhoods, but certainly some risk with traffic since it’s dark/low light. Solution: wear headlamp, reflective vest, shox open ear headphones. The volume of cars is lower at this time vs later in day when I should be working. I carry pepper spray just in case. 

Last issue for *now*: it’s dark and 5 o’clock, what happens if you have a medical emergency? You’ll freeze and nobody will find you. How do I counteract a hypothetical like this? If I have a major medical emergency like a heart attack while jogging I’ll probably just die. Can Apple Watch call 911? Should I get a life alert? 😂

While it sounds manageable on paper, balancing GMAT prep with your busy life can be challenging. Here’s how you can stay on track and make consistent progress toward your target score.

**Set a Realistic Study Schedule**

Aiming for 10 hours of study during the week and 5+ hours on the weekend is a great benchmark, but sticking to this plan requires discipline and creativity. Begin by assessing your weekly commitments and carving out specific time blocks for GMAT prep. Whether it’s an hour before work, during lunch breaks, or in the evenings, find a routine that fits your lifestyle.

Remember, the best study schedule is the one you can consistently follow. Having a set routine will not only keep you on track but also help you build momentum over time.

**Make Every Minute Count**

Your schedule doesn’t have to include long, uninterrupted study sessions. Use shorter windows of time effectively. For instance:

* Solve a few practice questions during your commute (if it’s safe to do so).
* Review flashcards while waiting in line.
* Watch a quick video lesson during a coffee break.

These small efforts add up and help reinforce key concepts throughout your day.

**Stay Motivated With Rewards**

Studying for the GMAT is a marathon, not a sprint. To stay motivated, reward yourself for your hard work and consistency. For example:

* After completing a full week of studying, treat yourself to something enjoyable, like a favorite meal or an episode of your favorite show.
* Plan a cheat day every few weeks. Take a break from studying and do something fun, whether it’s going to the movies, spending time with friends, or simply relaxing.

These moments of relaxation will help you recharge and maintain a positive mindset during your prep journey.

**Why Consistency Is Key**

The GMAT is not just a test of your knowledge—it’s a test of your commitment and endurance. By sticking to a consistent study schedule, you’ll build the skills, confidence, and stamina needed to excel on test day.

So, take control of your time, stay disciplined, and don’t forget to celebrate your progress. With the right balance of hard work and rest, you’ll be well on your way to achieving your GMAT goals!

Hi everyone, Happy New Year! 🎉

I’m excited to share that I’m moving to Kuala Lumpur at the end of this month to explore whether I can see myself living long-term in this vibrant city. As a single person, I’m looking for a neighborhood that suits my lifestyle—ideally not an area that’s primarily family-focused.

Here are a few things I’m hoping to find in my new neighborhood:

• **Cozy breakfast/coffee spots**: I enjoy working from cafes with my laptop, so a neighborhood with great breakfast and coffee places would be fantastic.

• **Walkability**: I appreciate areas where I can easily walk to nearby amenities, cafes, and other spots without needing to rely too much on transportation.

• **Proximity to green spaces**: I love spending time outdoors, so being close to a park or a green area for walks or relaxation is a big plus.

I’d love to hear your recommendations. Bonus points for areas with a mix of local charm and modern conveniences!

So many choices lines about politics 

> Losing respect when Clinton fucked that lewinki chick 

> Sniping that Chaney dyke 

> Whitehouse wiped out 

> The awfully hot coffee pot fiasco 

Amongst many others... Yet did anyone else lose a lot of respect when he did that mini concert for Kamala (the woman who ran against zionDon, I know she's hard to remember even after all the astroturfing). I mean yeah whatever ""he just did it for the money"" that almost makes it worse considering he's using his fame to try and convince people to follow a corrupt politician for money he doesn't need. (Btw I get this is reddit and no I dont like drumpf, as funny as he is). 


I dont know how he can joke about rape and murder (which is fine imo) but cry about trump joking around. I mean, anyone, celebrity or not should have their eyes open to the American uniparty situation especially someone who was so aware, now he's aiding in their campaign yet he knows how corrupt they are. 

What do people feel about that, I still listen to him and stuff but I was just curious about the thoughts in this sub as I'm not a regular user. I've started listening to a lot more unknown rappers and DnB due to things like this. 

Again just want a friendly conversation.  What do you guys think about this switch up? Did he just go a bit Hollywood or what? I can't figure out his change in attitude.

1hrqvop,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hrqvop/aita_for_blowing_off_my_bestfriend_on_her_birthday/,"AITA for “blowing off” my bestfriend on her birthday?
","To give some background, I (18 f) recently went to college and now live 45 minutes from my hometown. My best friend (19 f) of 10 years stayed local and did online community college to help her family. Before I left, she mentioned visiting often, which worried me since I live in a small dorm with 3 others and study engineering, leaving me constantly busy. She visited a few times in the first two months, but each visit was stressful. Managing coursework, sharing space with everyone, and having to cancel plans with my new friends.

While I loved her visits, there were issues. She wasn’t respectful of my space, left trash behind, and got annoyed when I prioritized university events. She mocked my new friends, even pulling up pictures to make fun of them in front of others. I called her out, and while things improved, she took my boundaries as rejection. This led to a heated argument because she wanted more one-on-one time, but it kinda made me feel trapped like I was hers to control.

A couple months in, I ended up hospitalized and diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune deficiency and doctors were worried I would become septic. This crushed my social life. My health deteriorated to the point I nearly dropped out.

During the first argument, she said, “tell me when you’re free because I’m done trying.” I never told her because I was never free with all I had going. A month before her birthday, she asked if we could go to a football game, but said it like if I didn't go I should feel bad about myself. I hate football games and feared large crowds would worsen my health, but I felt guilty since we always spent birthdays together. The week before, I had my midterms, studying 16-hour days and barely sleeping. The day before the game, she asked if we could go to the pep rally, but I told her After a nap, my roommates invited me to go to Target and get coffee. It was spontaneous, and then we later hung out at a friend's place.

Walking back to our room that night, she ended up stalking my location so she could confront me about hanging out with other people, saying “I see how it is. You told me you weren’t going to the pep rally.” I tried explaining how it was unplanned, but she dismissed me. The next day, I texted her happy birthday, but she ignored me. I woke up feeling terrible (not something new with all my health issues), making attending the game impossible. I texted her to explain but got no response. 

We haven’t spoken since the game. I feel bad missing her birthday, but I just had so much going on. I told her about my health and how my mom just got diagnosed with terminal cancer. Despite the shitty hand life was dealing me, she wasn’t sympathetic. In past arguments, I’ve always apologized to keep the peace, but this time feels different. I shouldn’t have to justify how hard my life has been. I can’t tell if I’m in the right and just setting boundaries or being petty, so am I the asshole for not making time for her these past few months?

**Withdrawal Rate**

While working towards FIRE I was aiming for a 4% safe withdrawal rate (SWR), and adjust as needed should there be a big downturn in a particular year.  I ended up working several years longer for a few reasons and when I was ready to FIRE on 1 January 2024 this SWR was down to 3.4% based on expected expenditure.

For 2024 expenses were 3.6% over budget, which meant I ended up with a withdrawal rate of 3.5% of my starting net worth.

**Redraw Method**

Quite simple at the moment, for the first 3-4 years my plan is to spend the money I have in cash, combined with dividends received from shares and property investments.  I won’t need to start selling down shares until after this initial period.

**Net Worth (NW) Change**

My net worth for the year, inclusive of investment gains and spending, increased 9.1%.  Many people appear to have had far greater returns last year. I think this is due to property investments I hold in commercial syndicates and PPoR, both of which have decreased in value.  
Investments

I have roughly 65% of my investments in shares (direct and via super fund), 30% in property and just under 5% in cash.  

This year instead of paying off my PPoR I decided to try debt recycling when refinancing, so I’ve recycled 90% of the loan, with the remaining 10% in an offset that I use for spending.   It was an interesting psychological choice to debt recycle when in retirement - on one hand I’d have a home without the need to service the loan and therefore greater spending power on other things, yet now with debt recycling my spending increases due to having to pay interest on the loan, but with the opportunity for greater future gains in NW.  I did this around July so will do a full write up and analysis once this has been a year.

**What we do with our time**

Honestly, since FIREing I don’t know how I kept up with a full-time job and also had a life! Only it’s worse since I also used to do a lot of overtime, weekends and nights. I guess I didn’t have much of a life when I was working compared to now.


We’ve done a fair bit of travel this year - five countries in total for me, and three for my partner.  On top of that we’ve spent time around the country catching up with family in different states at least 8 different times. We’ve moved cities, so that has taken up a lot of time setting up the new house and exploring the new city, meeting new people etc.  

Days in general, when we are not travelling, involve waking up whenever we feel like - usually this is me waking at 7.30 with the sun, chilling on my phone then dosing back to sleep!  Then one of us will go for a coffee run and before you know it it’s 11am and the morning is gone. Which of course is fine, because we can do what we want. Some days I do have feelings of guilt “I should be doing something” etc.  After lunch we might do some gardening, gaming, my partner has several different hobbies, afternoon is gym time then dinner. In between all this we are exploring a new city and catching up with new people for coffee or drinks trying to make some new connections.  

This year will be much of the same, more travel and settling in to our new place. I’ve only been bored a handful of times and have so much on my to do list the next year should be OK too. I was a bit worried about what I would do with my time before I fired, so I’m glad that year one has been a blast.

**How I got here**

Worked several jobs at a time throughout university and paid off hecs debt early (back then it was a 20% discount if you paid up-front).  I had a good paying, albeit demanding, job once out of uni but more importantly saved a lot of income. I tracked every single dollar I spent for 7 years. I travelled overseas once a year during my entire working life so never missed out here.   However, I will say that my job often came at the expense of friendships, of which I could not maintain many due to general lack of availability to hang out. When you keep saying no to things, eventually you stop being asked. A lesson learnt.  That said, I did and still have some friends, a great partner and good relationship with my family.

After 6 years of full-time work, I started a business which increased my income a little and then had that for around 8 years. Mostly however it is because I started on the FIRE journey when I was a teenager. I bought my first parcel of shares when I was 13 haha.  I knew what I wanted, and worked towards it, however didn’t come across this FIRE term until much later.  I actually reached my first FIRE goal on the eve of my 30th birthday, which was quite a cool milestone.  When people say “you’re quite young” to have achieved that, you have to remember that it’s been more than 15 years I’ve been working towards this.  When I was in my 20s I also had unique ways to save money, one example being through housing, I rented larger houses in very nice areas as the “head tenant”, sublet the other rooms and barely paid $35/week rent for these million-dollar properties. I did this in two different locations for over 6 years. The money saved from rent alone as I’m sure you can work out was significant and went straight into investing.

I’ve tried all sorts of different investments throughout the years however honestly I’m not a good investor. The best thing I ever did for myself was create an ETF plan and stick to it.

**2025 Budget**

I really am trying the whole “4% rule” strategy; even though I started on a 3.4% SWR, so I’ve increased our budget for 2025 by the inflation rate for the year which was approximately 2.1%.  This is now a 3.2% redraw rate based on this year’s starting net worth.

**What Else**

I don’t really know if there’s anything else people might be interested in or something I’ve missed. Let me know if you have any questions and if are interested in actual $ figures I can probably reveal a little more about this via DM.  If anyone has any feedback on my spending, investment choices or calculations please let me know, always happy to hear if I’ve made a wrong assumption etc.

1hrquba,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1hrquba/10_years_of_slavery_ch22/,10 Years of Slavery - Ch.22,"I moved to the guest bedroom after that night. And Ellie started telling people that we broke up. Everything else was pretty much the same, but I was going to the guest bedroom to sleep. I was craving her presence and smell in my room, but I didn't complain and followed her will. Ellie also didn't have sex with anyone for a while until things calm down and people stop caring about us.

Around that time, I believe soon before Ellie and Kyle broke up, I got a cold call from Hazel. I even struggled to remember who Hazel is when I answered the phone, but she reminded herself to me saying that she's Dylan's sister, and Ellie gave my number to her. And she was asking me to help her with an assignment. What she told me is that she asked Dylan first, which send her over to Ellie, saying her major is related to that -which was not-, so eventually Ellie sent her over to me saying I can help her. It wasn't a big deal so I helped her.

Then a week after, she called me for the second one. Soon, the third one wasn't an ask for help, instead she asked me if I can do the entire assignment for her as she had some other urgent stuff to do. At that point, I told her that it would not be appropriate and I can't do the full assignment for her. I was trying to be a responsible adult, but also knowing that I should be respectful towards her, I added that I am happy to help if she needs any support for parts of it.

She sighed, and thanked me briefly before hanging up. But the same evening, Ellie called me into her room, and asked me why I didn't help Hazel. It was the first time we actually talked about me helping Hazel. I told her that I was helping her already for a while, but this time she asked me to do the entire work and that's why I refused. But then Ellie gave me very clear commands:

""You are not an epitome of merit pinky. It's not even your concern to be a responsible adult or a role model for her. You are just a tool to do whatever you're told to. So you will call Hazel now, apologise and ask her to send over that assignment. To make up for your disrespect, you'll do the other schoolwork she has too. And you will ask her to send assignments straight away from now on. Clear?""

""Sure Ellie, I'm sorry.""

""Don't say it to me. Call her now and make sure to apologise properly.""

So I called Hazel. While it's ringing, Ellie asked me to put it on the speaker:

""Hi Hazel, I'm sorry to refuse helping you with the assignment. Can you please accept my apologies? To make up for it I'll do this one and the others you have.""

""No worries, no need to apologise... and thanks for this...""

I heard in her voice that he wasn't sure how to respond, but also willing to continue exploiting my services. Then, Ellie urged me silently to continue. So I carried on:

""And after this one when you have an assignment that you think I can help, please forward them straight to me with a deadline and I'll do my best to help. I hope that would make up for my rudeness earlier?""

""I think so... it would be nice actually... thanks...""

""My pleasure. Happy to help anytime.""

After that day, I did numerous tasks and assignments for her. She was simply forwarding me emails, or sending a photo of the assignment paper and I was getting that done with an ""executive summary"" as soon as possible.

...

Back then, my entire life was evolving around doing the housework and assignments for Ellie and Hazel, and taking care of my own studies whenever I have time. Actual in-person serving to Ellie was mostly limited to occassional worship sessions whenever she asks. Other than that occassions, a real slave's life is quite dull. It's not a constant latex-dressed freakshow as internet makes you believe. It's much more of doing the dishes, cooking, laundry, vacuuming, and boring schoolwork. I was also given up all of my social life to be able to keep up with everything. Since we announced our break-up, I wasn't being invited to social gatherings as much as before, and my other friends were slowly giving up on me.

Actually, one of my once-close friends tried to talk to me, thinking I'm depressed and need some help, but I assured him that everything's fine and I'm doing great. Which was sort of true. I tried to attend some gatherings, but I was sensing a pitiness towards me from people, most likely because everyone was thinking that Ellie cheated on me, and then dumped me but we were still pretending to be friends and living together. Yeah that's sort of something to be pity of, but it still made all those gatherings annoying and I stopped going anywhere. Sometimes, when Ellie has people over, I was greeting them before disappearing in my room for assignments.

....

Then, one night Ellie came back with a friend, Ava.

I was in my room when they made their way into the living room. Just seconds later, I heard Ellie shouting my ""slave name"":

""Pinky!!!""

It was my unofficial slave name, and she was almost exclusively calling me ""pinky"" by then. Still, I felt something worrying was about to happen.

When I entered the room, Ellie was sitting on the armchair while hanging her legs over one of the armrests, and Ava was on the sofa. I saw an eager glow on her eyes. Then, Ellie told me something I was dreading to hear about:

""Take off my shoes slave!""

She had an evilish smile on her beautiful face. I heard Ava's laugh.

....

I went beet red instantly, but it didn't prevent me from going down on my knees. I was facing away from Ava, so didn't see her reaction, but she screamed an ""Oh my god!"" when I went on my knees. I felt the burning sensation of embarrassment all over my body. I untied her shoes slowly while she watched me with a grin. I removed Ellie's shoes silently and looked at her face. She didn't say anything and kept watching me. So, I took off her socks as well, and approached to her naked soles.

""Oh my god ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!!!"" screamed Ava with an extreme excitement when I started kissing her soles. I wasn't going to stop until I'm told so. I was determined to endure all humiliation, all degradation. And I was enjoying it truly. I was rock-hard already. My soft kisses turned into wet ones. I sucked the delicate arch of her foot. Made my way slowly to her heels, making sure not to miss a single spot. Then I moved up, following the slight curve of her outer soles I reached to her sweet small toes.

""I told you that he's very well trained."" Said Ellie while pressing her big toe lightly on my lips. I opened my mouth and started sucking. I saw that she was proud of her work of art on her gaze.

""That is sick!"" Ava was still struggling to believe what she was seeing. Ellie didn't say anything, and kept watching my dedication on worshipping her.

""I knew something was going on between you two for a while but boy not this!""

""Pinky, why don't you help our guest too?""

I stopped briefly and looked at her. I wasn't sure what she was expecting from me. Worship Ava?

""Go and take off her shoes too, make her feel like home."" She said to put an end to my confusion, and pushed me gently on the face with her feet.

""Sure Ellie, sorry I couldn't think..."" then I got up, walked towards Ava and got on my knees again. She was watching me with an awe, and was probably more confused than me. We both didn't know what to do, or how to react. I didn't even know what Ellie told about me, and how much she knows. Avoiding an eye contact, I asked her silently:

""May I help you to take off your shoes?""

She had some ugly-looking loafers, and unlike Ellie's sneakers it didn't require any untying. She raised both of her feet slightly, and I quickly removed her shoes, revealing her veiny ankles and low-cut liner socks . Briefly, I thought that Ellie never had such an ugly shoes or socks. Another thing she was perfect on. It was no suprise that I was hopelessly in love with her.

""Go ahead, kiss them. Don't be shy."" said Ellie. But Ava hesitated, and pulled back her feet.

""I'm not sure I'm ready for that...."" said Ava. Things were happening too fast, and I wasn't ready either. I felt grateful. I raised my eyes and looked at her. She was actually quite charming, a thin olive-skinned lady with dark and wavy hair. She also was playing tennis and had a nicely toned body. From outside, nothing was wrong about her, but I felt everything was wrong about kneeling in front of her.

""Haha, that's fair. It feels weird to see someone kneeling in front of you for the first time, I know. Pinky, go and grab us some drinks.""

I almost jumped back up, mumbled a quick ""right away"" and rushed to the kitchen to save myself from further embarrassment. I heard them talking while I was pouring them wine.

""Pinky, would you like to explain why did you wanted to be my slave?"" Ellie asked me while I handed them their drinks. Although I never ""wanted"" to be her slave, since she put it that way it was the reality now. But I didn't know where to start. I didn't even know how that happened and how we ended up being a slave. Everything was gradual.

""I don't have an answer for that. It happened over time I guess."" I said.

""Are you one of those foot freaks?"" asked Ava outright. Was I? I definitely adored Ellie's feet, and loved worshipping them. But I never felt the same for other girls' feet. I didn't even liked anything related to feet before all this happened. Ellie was silently watching me while I answer Ava's rude question.

""I don't think I am actually.""

""Then why did you do that so eagerly?"" I thought briefly before I answered:

""Probably because Ellie enjoys that a lot. Anything that makes her happy, makes me happy too.""

""Aww, you're so cute!"" said Ellie.

""So then you're an Ellie freak. I am not going to kink-shame anyone, if it's what gets you off, then so be it. But this is hilarious. Ellie, girl you are lucky. You should tell me your secrets.""

I was standing on the corner, my eyes were locked on the carpet. I was feeling an immense embarrasment, but had nowhere to hide.

""It takes two actually. You first need to someone like him. Then we can work on that.""

""So how does it work then? If it's still a thing between you, why did you break up? I have a lot of questions for you if you don't mind?""

""It's simple as that actually. He's a slave, and I own him. He does whatever I say.""

""There's nothing simple about that Ellie. It's the 21st century. Is this consensual or do you blackmail him or something?""

""There's absolutely nothing keeping him here. I told him several times that he can leave whenever he wants. He can just say stop, and I'll let him free. Do you want to be free Pinky?"" She turned her head towards me.

""I'm happy to be your slave Ellie."" I said with a robotic voice.

""So be it then. Does he call you ""mistress"" like BDSM stuff? Do you guys still have sex? How does it work? Sorry if I'm too inquisitive but I need to get to the bottom of it.""

""I actually prefer my name, I find those words kinda stupid. It's not a roleplay it's our way of living. And Pinky, would you like to answer the rest?"" Ellie said, and chuckled. My response was concise:

""We actually never had sex.""

""What! How! Aren't you together since like eternity? Are you a mormon or something? Are you still a virgin?""

Ellie laughed out loud again, but didn't answer Ava. She was still watching me squirming to answer Ava's question:

""I devoted myself to stay virgin for her. Ellie is free to enjoy her sex life with whoever else she wants.""

""Oh wow that's even more cruel than I imagined.""

""I don't think it's cruel."" said Ellie. ""We are both satisfied with what we get. I don't see any problems. Am I being cruel Pinky?""

""Not at all."" I replied. ""It might sound strange to you Ava, but I really enjoy being her submissive. I admit that it took a while for me to accept my real self, but I'm at peace now. I love Ellie as she is, and I love seeing her happy, and she's free to do whatever makes her happy.""

""So you're a cuckold?""

""It's not as simple as that. To be a cuckold, you need to be a couple in the first place. We started as one but we're not a real couple for a while now, and we never had sex in the first place. I would call us more of a slave and his owner."" Ellie clarified. I nodded.

""You get all the fun, he gets all the pain. Fair enough. But how it started in the first place? How did you open up? Spill the beans please I wanna learn everything.""

""It's a long story actually, Pinky, refresh our drinks."" she said and handed me her glass. Then she started telling our story to Ava while I stood between them awkwardly.

It was the first time I heard our story from her perspective. I stood up between them the entire time awkwardly, while she told Ava how she grew in liking her power over me, pushing me to the limits and seeing me complying was giving her an immense joy. She was also finding out her limits, desires, likes, kinks while playing around with me. And most of the time she thought that the next thing she pushed me to do was going to be the last straw and I'll quit. But I kept obeying her. And it encouraged her more and more. They burst into laughter when she described how I begged her to go and fuck someone while sucking the dirt off of her feet. I was too embarrassed to look anywhere but the carpet, but I was also incredibly turned on.

Ava was making insulting comments once in a while as if I'm not there. She told stuff like ""no real man would do that"", ""my dick must not be working"", ""most pathetic thing she ever heard of"", ""it's good that Ellie found my true identity and didn't end up with a loser by accident"". But it still suprised her when Ellie also told her that I wasn't allowed to orgasm:

""So, literally you get all the sex, fun, and comfort while he gets absolutely nothing but all the chores? Not even cumming on kleenex? This is super cool. Literally the best form a man can reach.""

""Yeah you can say that I'm proud of my work.""

It was past midnight, and Ellie told me to prepare the guest bedroom for Ava, and the sofa for myself. I changed the sheets and prepared everything while they're about to finish, and everyone went to sleep. I expected Ellie to call me in for a worship session, but she didn't.

In the morning I greeted the girls with coffee right after they woke up, and prepared them a proper breakfast. I felt more relaxed in front of Ava, and even made a joke and said that she will have higher expectations from her prospective boyfriends after seeing me.

""First thing I'd expect is sex and here you failed already."" she said and both broke into laughter. I smiled and nodded.

""Actually, do you borrow him out? I could use his services for a day, my place is a mess.""

""Hmm, yeah why not? He doesn't have much to keep himself busy lately anyways. Pinky, you're free this Saturday right?""

""Nope. I have no plans.""

""I'm not asking about your plans idiot, I'm asking about the assignments or any other stuff you got to do.""

""Nothing urgent Ellie.""

Quite simple at the moment, for the first 3-4 years my plan is to spend the money I have in cash, combined with dividends received from shares and property investments.  I won’t need to start selling down shares until after this initial period.

**Net Worth (NW) Change**

My net worth for the year, inclusive of investment gains and spending, increased 9.1%.  Many people appear to have had far greater returns last year. I think this is due to property investments I hold in commercial syndicates and PPoR, both of which have decreased in value. 
Investments

I have roughly 65% of my investments in shares (direct and via super fund), 30% in property and just under 5% in cash.  

This year instead of paying off my PPoR I decided to try debt recycling when refinancing, so I’ve recycled 90% of the loan, with the remaining 10% in an offset that I use for spending.   It was an interesting psychological choice to debt recycle when in retirement - on one hand I’d have a home without the need to service the loan and therefore greater spending power on other things, yet now with debt recycling my spending increases due to having to pay interest on the loan, but with the opportunity for greater future gains in NW.  I did this around July so will do a full write up and analysis once this has been a year.

-

EFTs -

First ETF strategy: 40% VAS, 30% VTS, 30% VEU

-

Second strategy when I debt recycled: 100% DHHF 

(I would have done this, or another all-inclusive ETF if they existed when I first started investing)

-

Super - 

Hostplus Indexed Balanced

-


Property - 

PPoR, 6.04%
Investments in commercial property syndicates

Investment in monthly income trust, Trilogy Funds. 

-

Cash - 

Sitting in offset. Use credit card for points and to maximise length of time money stays in offset.

**What we do with our time**

Honestly, since FIREing I don’t know how I kept up with a full-time job and also had a life! Only it’s worse since I also used to do a lot of overtime, weekends and nights. I guess I didn’t have much of a life when I was working compared to now.


We’ve done a fair bit of travel this year - five countries in total for me, and three for my partner.  On top of that we’ve spent time around the country catching up with family in different states at least 8 different times. We’ve moved cities, so that has taken up a lot of time setting up the new house and exploring the new city, meeting new people etc.  

Days in general, when we are not travelling, involve waking up whenever we feel like - usually this is me waking at 7.30 with the sun, chilling on my phone then dosing back to sleep!  Then one of us will go for a coffee run and before you know it it’s 11am and the morning is gone. Which of course is fine, because we can do what we want. Some days I do have feelings of guilt “I should be doing something” etc.  After lunch we might do some gardening, gaming, my partner has several different hobbies, afternoon is gym time then dinner. In between all this we are exploring a new city and catching up with new people for coffee or drinks trying to make some new connections.  

This year will be much of the same, more travel and settling in to our new place. I’ve only been bored a handful of times and have so much on my to do list the next year should be OK too. I was a bit worried about what I would do with my time before I fired, so I’m glad that year one has been a blast.

**How I got here**

Worked several jobs at a time throughout university and paid off hecs debt early (back then it was a 20% discount if you paid up-front).  I had a good paying, albeit demanding, job once out of uni but more importantly saved a lot of income. I tracked every single dollar I spent for 7 years. I travelled overseas once a year during my entire working life so never missed out here.   However, I will say that my job often came at the expense of friendships, of which I could not maintain many due to general lack of availability to hang out. When you keep saying no to things, eventually you stop being asked. A lesson learnt.  That said, I did and still have some friends, a great partner and good relationship with my family.

After 6 years of full-time work, I started a business which increased my income a little and then had that for around 8 years. Mostly however it is because I started on the FIRE journey when I was a teenager. I bought my first parcel of shares when I was 13 haha.  I knew what I wanted, and worked towards it, however didn’t come across this FIRE term until much later.  I actually reached my first FIRE goal on the eve of my 30th birthday, which was quite a cool milestone.  When people say “you’re quite young” to have achieved that, you have to remember that it’s been more than 15 years I’ve been working towards this.  When I was in my 20s I also had unique ways to save money, one example being through housing, I rented larger houses in very nice areas as the “head tenant”, sublet the other rooms and barely paid $35/week rent for these million-dollar properties. I did this in two different locations for over 6 years. The money saved from rent alone as I’m sure you can work out was significant and went straight into investing.

I’ve tried all sorts of different investments throughout the years however honestly I’m not a good investor. The best thing I ever did for myself was create an ETF plan and stick to it.

**2025 Budget**

I really am trying the whole “4% rule” strategy; even though I started on a 3.4% SWR, so I’ve increased our budget for 2025 by the inflation rate for the year which was approximately 2.1%.  This is now a 3.2% redraw rate based on this year’s starting net worth.

**What Else**

I don’t really know if there’s anything else people might be interested in or something I’ve missed. Let me know if you have any questions and if are interested in actual $ figures I can probably reveal a little more about this via DM.  If anyone has any feedback on my spending, investment choices or calculations please let me know, always happy to hear if I’ve made a wrong assumption etc.

Hello everyone!
I just moved to Neuchâtel recently and thought I’d introduce myself here! I’m a 24-year-old guy who finished university last year, and I’ve moved here for work. I don’t know anyone in the area yet, so I’d love to meet people around my age. If you’re up for grabbing a coffee, going for a walk, or just hanging out, let me know! I’m starting to learn French, and in my free time, I enjoy skiing (I’m not a professional), going for walks, reading and doing sports.",2,1735813558.0,neuchatel,0,1.0,False
