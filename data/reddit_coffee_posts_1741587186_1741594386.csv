I got way more attention than I expected, want to know if this many people (about 100 unique messages) in 3 days is normal in a low population city, and I am afraid of STI's, and generally am a gremlin with no life outside my house so I'm afraid to form sexual relationships with people and need advice. Also, I'm so fucking serious, does this most likely mean I'm actually attractive, or just that there are a lot of desperate creeps who want an Asian twink who looks relatively young? I feel like a dumbass and a fraud. This is the first time I've had any substantial amount of sexual attention, and it's a lot all at once.**

I've emboldened the most relevant details and questions for legibility purposes.

I have had major self esteem and self image problems basically my entire life. I'm an Asian man in one of the most homogeneous White states in the U.S. I have never been given a single indication in my entire life that I was remotely attractive, and the women I dated, I didn't really have intercourse with, save for a few occasions. My entire life I've been harassed, bullied, and made fun of - even with my online friends, who constantly clown me for various components of my appearance, which I never understood - I could never do that to anyone, ever. People had frequently, and still do, made small Asian dick ""jokes,"" commented on my ""squinty eyes,"" made fun of me for my small Asian frame relative to White Midwestern male bodies, constantly insinuated that it wasn't possible for ""someone like me"" to ever be with a girl, joked about beating me up because I'm a ""weak Asian,"" etc. This context is relevant.

I downloaded Grindr 3 days ago because I started receiving positive attention from a male who I found attractive. I found it extremely difficult to believe him when he told me I was hot, cute, good looking, etc. I figured he was just fucking with me or pranking me as people often do to me. On Grindr, I suppose I wanted to confirm that I really am as unattractive as I have known myself to be my whole life, and that I would not get many messages, and secretly hoped that MAYBE I would find that I'm slightly more attractive than I thought.

Boy was I wrong.

At first, I was getting a message from a new person every \~15-45 minutes for 2 days straight, even through the night. It only started to slow down to 1 message every \~hour - 2 hours or so on Saturday evening. As you can imagine, my inbox is completely full of hundreds of dude's dicks, dudes repeatedly messaging me ""hi, hey, hi,"" like 4 times each because I didn't respond, and so on. ***Mind you, this is a small town of approximately 200k population.***

**Is this just a normal amount of attention? Like seriously it's fucking me up, I need to know if this amount of people contacting me is normal and I'm just over-reacting.**

I've only responded to literally 2 or 3 people this entire time, meanwhile there's about 100 unique people in my inbox in the past 3 days. What the fuck am I supposed to do? I've never hooked up with anyone before just for the sake of hooking up. I've never even been with a guy before, aside from a blowjob several years ago, which was a negative experience - please don't ask. I have crazy anxiety, am not amazing socially, and have major self esteem and body image issues. Even the guys I have responded to, I don't know if I feel comfortable meeting up with them for ""coffee"" or something adjacent, and even moreso I'm not sure I am comfortable having sex with any of them yet. This was all completely unexpected, I thought I was going to get like 5 messages, not 30x that amount. I don't even have any friends in real life, I just spend all my time on the computer mostly reading, watching educational content, learning, and exercising various hobbies like gaming, linguistics, writing, music production, etc. I basically never exit the house except to go to work.

I guess this absurdly long-winded diatribe is me asking for help. I don't know if I am ready to have gay sex yet. I don't know if I am ready to meet the guys who are asking to meet casually. I don't know if I'm doing any of this right, and I don't know if I will do it right if I get into a position where we're already meeting up for coffee or sex. I'm really nervous about so much.

**I also worry A LOT about venereal diseases. Condoms, sure, but what's to stop me from touching genital warts or syphilis sores in their pubic region where the condom is not? Or what about when I go down on them? Most of these guys indicate they're on PrEP, which to me, indicates they likely have frequent and numerous sexual partners - good for them! - but that also means the likelihood of me contracting something is exponentially greater. Am I supposed to get tested every time I have sex with a new person? Should I start PrEP as soon as possible? Do I need to wait to have sex until I'm on PrEP even if my partner is on it? How much can I trust these people when they say they do not have any sexually transmitted diseases? Is it appropriate or faux-pas for me to ask them for their test results before hooking up?**",0,1741591939.0,askgaybros,1,0.5,False

But when I checked with DTI, it flagged down the name cause of BN laws- which made sense. One option is to make the 2 worded name- into one. Example: Blue Coffee Shop, into BlueCoffeeshop.

  
Now, I still want to DTI but l'm thinking of another name for DTI but still sticking to Blue Coffee Shop as business name. Example: Kola Refreshment Stall (DTI name) but Blue Coffee Shop (still as business name/ everything marketing also)

  
What do you think about that? What is the smartest way as a business owner?

  
Options A: Keep Blue Coffee Shop. DTI will be Kola Refreshment Stall.  
Option B: Change name to Kola to align with DTI name Kola Refreshment Stall.  
Option C: Just keep Blue Coffee Shop as DTI also but ONE WORD:  
BlueCoffeeshop.

1j7t3yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1j7t3yh/second_week_on_omad_progress_report/,"Second week on OMAD, Progress report.","Hi there OMAD people.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

**Overall Stats:**  
**Gender:**¬†Male  
**Starting weight:**¬†110,0 kg  
**Current weight as of this morning:**¬†105,2 kg  
**Height:**¬†193 cm  
**Goal:**¬†90 kg  
**Weeks on OMAD:**¬†2

**Week 2:**  
**Starting weight:**¬†110,0 kg  
**End weight:**¬†106,6 kg  
**Weight loss week 2:**¬†1,4 kg  
  
**Sunday:**¬†106,6  
**Monday:**¬†105,5 kg  
**Tuesday:**¬†106,0 kg  
**Wednesday:**¬†105,8 kg  
**Thursday:**¬†105,0 kg  
**Friday:**¬†105,1 kg  
**Saturday:**¬†105,4 kg  
**Sunday:**¬†104,5  
**Monday:**¬†105,2 kg

As expected things have slowed down a bit from the initial rush of not eating as much, but i am still seeing progress, and during this week i started seeing clear visible signs of weight loss, belly getting smaller.  
By now, the urge to drink around 1 liter of soda per day is more or less gone, which is amazing!   
I no longer have the unprovoked sugar cravings that could be difficult to push through week one, but damn do i still have the ""provoked"" sugar cravings. By provoked sugar cravings, i mean when i see candy, crisps, chocolate while shopping groceries etc. All i really want to do in that situation is just buy some, and eat it straight away. So far i have managed to stay away from it, and i hope it is just a matter of time before i have trained my brain to stay away from that instant gratification of candy.  
  
I managed to get 40 minutes of intense cardio training in this week, and hope to continue that pace with 2-3 times per week, though it can be difficult to find the time with small children in the house as well.

I have added a graph from my weight tracking app. most of the swings are because i enjoy weighing my self several times per day when i have time as such my lowest weight this week was actually 103,8 kg at 14:24 on Friday, but for consistency i report only my morning weight, from right when i get out of bed. 

Stay safe and praise the One Meal God :D

1j7t3sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchOfMineta/comments/1j7t3sh/hallway/,Hallway,"He entered the hallway, seeing the large, carpeted floor before him. The smell of nicotine and the sound of bad music shook the entire building. 

Placing his hand on the hard wooden walls, he felt along them. An odd beat sounded through them. Dragging his palm, Mineta stopped short of one of the middle doors. Room one-three-four. So, the clerk hadn't lied.

He could smell the alcohol and other substances even outside. Scumbags always needed their creature comforts. Slowly, he grabbed several grapes from his head and walked to the walls, placing them about the immediate area around the door. 

He placed a hand on the doorknob after walking back to it. Locked of course. There was an easy fix for that. Taking out a small pin, he stuck it into the lock. 

Several times he stopped to look around, no bodies coming his way or in the hall. Good, he needed surprise. The music would drown out any noise. 

When it snapped open, there was a moment where he felt something fill through his body. Around his waist all the way to his torso and up through his head. A breath escaped him. Then he wound the door open. 

Inside, a couch and chairs were gathered around a coffee table. Sitting on them were five men dressed in suits of black or white, each starting up when they saw the boy. He ran forward, jumping off the table and planting his heel into a lizard heteromorphs face.

A small cry, one of a child emanated from a connected shoji as one man grabbed him by the cape, his quirk granting him the strength of three men. He was flung right out of the door and hit the wall hard. As his head spun, he cursed himself for not placing a grape there.

They were screaming something, but he wasn't listening. Most were the usual threats and breathless insults. The lizard was quick to follow up, rushing out of the door and grabbing the boy by the throat and pressed him against the wall. The muscle memory kicking in, Mineta grabbed his wrists and wrenched them down. He then turned and elbowed him with all his small might.

Swearing, the lizard wrenched back and covered his scaley nose. Two others came out by this point, ganking him. Getting past their friend, they reached out for him. One got a hold, the other he maneuvered around with his small body. He nearly tripped and brought a hand up only to grab one of the grapes.

As he swore, Mineta lurched back and forth trying to slip out of the guy's grasp. He felt his hands going hot and that's when he knew all methods were required. His knee came up and crashed into the family jewels. 

Seeing him reel down and groan painfully, Mineta lifted his leg for a knee smash, but was picked up by the strongman and smashed into the wall. A harsh breath escaped him, and stars were in his peripheral. The one caught with the grape was kicking back at him and only managing to hit his friends arm weakly instead. 

The momentary distraction allowed Mineta to poke his finger into the big guy's eye. He let out a screech, dropping him on his ass. Not done, he pushed up and kicked him in the knee as hard as he possibly could. A loud snap and more of his screams were audible over the music as he toppled back. 

The other two had finally made their way to the outside and stepped over their friends. The one in the back pulled something. He tried bringing the gun up, but his friend was in the way, and much taller than Mineta. Meanwhile, his buddy was attacking. He'd turning his fingers into boney knives and stabbed at the boy.

Grabbing his arm, the man swiped back tagging him across the chest. Speckles of blood appeared on the darkened costume. Mineta didn't have time to notice as two shots of the gun rang out, all of which hit the wall and the door at the end of the hall. They all covered their ears from the sound. 

Mineta opened his eyes to see them standing there, and he was standing there breathing heavily as they all huffed. Then the lizard remembered they were in a fight and rushed towards him bowling past the other two with a yell. Dropping to the floor Mineta threw a grape behind him at the same moment and lay sideways, tripping and causing the man to get stuck. He then got up and finished it with angry blows to the sides of the head. He nearly hit him in the back of the head but managed to restrain himself.

He cried out as something cold poked into his leg. He swung his head back and his skull hit knife fingers directly in the chin. Mineta saw him fall back only to see the barrel of the gun right on him. He moved his body left, bringing the same sides hand up and grabbed it. Three shots popped out causing his ears to pop in turn as he punched the gun into the man's hip and attached a grape to it. The man kicked him and Mineta tumbled back.

Another moment passed as he looked up and saw all of them struggling with his grapes or struggling to even move. He saw the strongman holding his inward knee, and he saw the man attached to the wall trying to tug his grape, and he heard the lizard man behind him trying to swallow his own tongue, and he saw knife hands laying oddly on the floor with blood coming out of a gash from his chin, and he saw the man with the gun running at him.

He fell on Mineta, using his free hand to reign down blows. Tanking some, especially a nasty shot to his eye that darkened it later, he moved his head and used the momentum against his opponent, causing him to tumble against the wall. As he got up, he felt his heart pounding in his ears as he jumped up and dropkicked the guy into one of his grapes. He then threw a grape at his head, almost panicking when he thought it'd covered his nose but no, it'd just come very close. Merely his mouth was covered.

No time to think about that when he screamed because of hot hands coming out of nowhere and placing a burning hand on his cheek. He turned and with hysterical strength smashed his hand against the wall where a grape awaited. Then he kicked in his leg with a roundhouse and struck five times before the guy stopped trying to use his other hand. It felt like half Mineta's face had been in an oven as he fell back.

Slowly, he got up and watched the strongman trying to stand. They stared at each other, the only two left yet one was down a leg. Sharp breaths escaped the both of them and sweat was all over Mineta's back. Making a motion to come at him, the villain found the boy doing just that. He threw a grape dead center at his head, causing the guy to turn his head as he looked away.

A grape jump infused kick to the forehead sent him to the ground. Mineta was quick to follow up with small mountains of grapes to all his limbs as his head bled. 

Taking a moment, he looked around. They were all knocked out, save the first to get stuck on the wall. He tried to whisper but Mineta said nothing and flipped for an axe kick to the top of the guy's skull. Now he was the only one conscious.

He lay on the floor after doing that, his whole-body sore and wracked in pain. Slowly, he managed to stand and walk inside. About thirty seconds later he came carrying out and covering the eyes of the small, kidnapped toddler who'd been taken by these men. He'd given her his mask. Passing by all of the bodies, he made his way back to the door as the child fiddled with the cloth. Oblivious to the carnage of bodies laying about.",2,1741591268.0,ChurchOfMineta,2,1.0,False

He has had a lot of health issues of which I have been a part of as a care taker to help out and reciprocate. 

This person has dedicated time to me and I to him.

Has asked me to marry him in the past due to the drinking I've stayed away from that conversation. 

I'm a single parent and because of divorcing children's father I'm jaded and doubt we would have a good marriage.

And we have tried to work things out off and on thru the years.

He has been my best friend, I feel. 

Since we have been off and on, seven years ago I met Male2.

When I met M2 he was leaving for a job promotion in another state.

Some time after I went to visit M2, (m1 has pictures with other females and when I helped with his house I have found other females underwear for example) since we don't have a relationship that I think I can trust.

When I went to visit M2 I had a wonderful time.

The trip gave me rest. He made sure of that, he has brought me coffee in bed, the other (M1) one is there for me to help.

I tried to have a long distance relationship with M2 but don't feel comfortable.

I have traveled to see him in other parts of the US as well and he has come to where I live to see each other.

I don't have patience with long distance relationships also, been there done that.

M2 recently retired, before he retired he was very clear to me saying, ""when I retire I want you to travel with me."" Not thinking about it, I said ok. He also said he was only going to take care of his girl (me) not my children. I know this can and will have to change. I'm also not close to retirement and Im not willing to live under him, meaning not working.

At that time I was taking care of my parents and children too.

M2 doesn't want to live in the town we met. We are very different in our view of life issues. He is also almost a decade older.

Our issue is, I feel M2 has fallen in love with me, I feel. I also feel for him.
Has told me if it was his choice I wouldn't live where I live. This man is not perfect either. Has told me before he didn't want a relationship but keeps waiting to get back together.

They both are are ready to ""work"" things out, so to speak.

M1 I feel tolerates me, I feel and my children see it, but would be disappointed If I left.

The good thing is my children a grown.

I think I have already answered my question.

But what would you guys do? Stay where you are tolerated or go to where you are celebrated.

My older children don't like or trust M2 but respect and trust M1.

I forgot, M1 is younger but disabled.

M1 has less money than M2. To me not really important, but to them maybe?",1,1741591045.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the future, where time is supposedly finite, but your witty digital twin can handle those tedious meetings for you. In the brave new world of AI minds, Dara Ladjevardian took a personal mission‚Äîpreserving his grandfather‚Äôs wisdom‚Äîand created Delphi, a startup that lets you clone your brain for fun and profit.

Imagine a world where experts sell their thoughts like vintage records. Coaches, doctors, even chess grandmasters like Magnus Carlsen could provide endless wisdom without the coffee stains of actual personal interaction. Now, you might question: ""Do we want a world filled with mind clones?"" It's like the existential and ethical sequel to Black Mirror we all didn't know we needed.

The magic cocktail of AI advancements has turned digital twins from science fiction to potential everyday applications. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves; as intriguing as it sounds, a digital twin isn't just going to wipe your calendar clean while you binge the latest show. Trust issues and novelty flirt awkwardly at this dance, and sustainability is the wallflower waiting for its moment to shine.

But here's the kicker: could this tech mean a form of digital immortality? Dara‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs wisdom lives on in ones and zeroes, ready to dispense sagacity at a moment's notice. Whether it revolutionizes how we interact or joins your collection of other digital ghosts is up to us.

1j7szxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bumblebff/comments/1j7szxd/actual_success_story/,Actual success story :),"I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people sharing their bad experiences, and I just wanted to share my positive experience to show some light at the end of the tunnel!

I tried using BBFF for years with no real luck, took a few years break, then picked it back up when my life felt more sturdy.
About 2-3 years ago (over several months, spread out), i met with 6 people from the app in person, and became friends with 4/6 of those gals! I am acquaintance-level friends with 1, good friends with 2, and very close with 1! All 4 are attending my wedding next month :)

I spent so much time and energy building these relationships that I actually got off the app because I was simply happy with the circle I had created üíï

If you‚Äôre curious, these are the tips I‚Äôd recommend/lessons learned:
1. Don‚Äôt judge solely based on looks, however you can tell a person‚Äôs vibe pretty well by the way they present themselves. Photo alone is not the best indicator, but it‚Äôs worth considering if their vibe matches yours.
2. If you don‚Äôt have at least 2-3 genuine interests in common, you might not find it easy to bond at first. 
3. Be personal in your bio, and seek the same from others! Basically everyone likes coffee, is ‚Äúdown for whatever‚Äù. What are your ACTUAL interests?
4. If the first meeting gives off ANY weird vibes, that‚Äôs because the vibes ARE weird. Trust your gut, it‚Äôs often good at reading people
5. If meeting up is where you get stuck, try being more specific. It‚Äôs not enough to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hang out sometime‚Äù.  It needs to be ‚Äúthere‚Äôs this restaurant I want to try that has a great happy hour, are you free this week to check it out with me?‚Äù Offer an activity right away, it‚Äôs a lot easier when one person takes initiative
6. Meet up often, remember a friendship isn‚Äôt built after one chat.
7. Even though I‚Äôm naturally introverted I love hosting, so for me havinn small gatherings or including them in parties (even when I didn‚Äôt know them well at the time) was amazing for creating memories and getting to bond! Also wouldn‚Äôt be here if they hadn‚Äôt said yes to things. Say yes to things!
8. It takes real effort, openness, and kindness! Ask lots of questions, and off lots of info about yourself too. No friendship is perfect, and you might have to kiss a few frogs as they say, but it is so so worth it if you stick with it‚ù§Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre wondering, the 2 I‚Äôm not friends with never did anything wrong. One girl I just didn‚Äôt feel a click with, and the other we hung out many times but she moved a bit further and then we both just kinda stopped reaching out to each other. Still follow each other on IG and still wish her well tho!

1j7szx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1j7szx3/joe_k_part_21/,Joe K - Part 21,"On the day of the by-election, Katie made the school run minus the schoolboy and plus K. For thirty years, the act of voting had been a routine exercise undertaken more to satisfy his mother's unwavering commitment to the democratic process than a projection of any personal ideology, but today it felt like he was at the casino putting everything on red. The queue outside could have been bad timing, but he hoped it was indicative of a good turnout - it didn't seem likely, somehow, that people would be rushing out to vote for Archie Johnson.

While they were both waiting for one of the two booths to empty, K looked around and spotted a zephyr right behind them with his hood up, as if taking the idea of a secret ballot one step further. Luckily, he was also looking behind, so didn't see K's face. He needed him to be in the other booth when he left his or it would be impossible for them to avoid acknowledging each other's existence, so he made sure Katie went first.

In the relative safety of the booth, K put an X next to Pearl Goolie's name and stared at it for a few seconds with his fingers crossed - first wishing her good luck, then wishing he'd taken a leaping pill so he could believe in luck, then remembering there was no such thing as leaping pills and wishing there was so he could wish he'd taken one so he could wish her good luck, and finally laughing at himself and folding the ballot paper. He was still smiling when he turned around and looked straight at the zephyr, who smiled back a full set of teeth. With a sigh of relief and an awkward greeting, he skipped passed and exercised his right into the ballot box so forcefully he had to mouth an apology to the returning officer. ""What were you laughing at?"" said Katie, when she joined him outside and they began to walk back to the car.

""Just nerves, I guess. What took you so long?""

""I was just looking at all the names, I didn't realise there was so many different teams to be honest. We're the favourites though, right?""

""It's not Wales in the rugby league.""

""The rugby league?""

""Is that not a thing?""

""It is, but I'm not sure it's the thing you think it is, do you mean...?""

""How long have you had a driver?"" he interrupted. The classically, and immaculately, attired chauffeur was juxtaposed against Katie's red Mini, absent-mindedly smoking a cigarette. She skipped ahead of K and went straight on the attack.

""Oi, what the bloody hell do you think you're doing sitting on my baby?""

""Please forgive me, madam,"" he said with an upper-class accent and subservient disposition that perfectly suited his appearance. ""I seem to have forgotten my manners."" He stood up straight, discarded his cigarette, and looked down at Katie from an six or seven inch advantage.

""Mademoiselle, if you don't mind, and if this is voter intimidation, you're a bit late.""

""With respect, mademoiselle, I would have to disagree - it's far too early in our relationship for intimate dating.""

""In that case... is it too late to change my vote?""

""Good morning, sir,"" he said to Katie's knight in shining armour, who was brave enough to catch up now that her initial cavalry charge had been parried with playful jousting. After K defensively returned his greeting, he addressed them both. ""My employer sends his apologies for the inconvenience, but you are to join him for lunch."" As far as Katie was concerned, he had just committed a sin that no degree of charm could atone for. All the men in her life, both personally and professionally, soon learn that you can ask her anything once, but don't ever tell her what to do.

""No thanks,"" she said. ""I've got to pick my son up, so if you don't mind getting your fat arse out of my way.""

""This is incorrect. My employer informs me that your son is at a friend's house and you don't have to pick him up until four o'clock. I have been instructed to assure you, on his behalf, that we will be back here in two or three hours, which gives us plenty of time... and my arse is not fat.""

""Please,"" said K. ""It's me he wants to talk to, there's no need to drag her into this. Let her go and I'll come with you."" In return for the most gallant act in his short tenure as Katie's knight, he received the coldest look she'd ever given him.

""My instructions are clear, sir, both yourself and the mademoiselle are to accompany me.""

""Could you, at least, tell us where we're going?"" said Katie, feeling that K's intervention had now obligated her to offer her full cooperation.

""The Bridge Inn, mademoiselle, do you know it?""

""No, where is it? - and stop calling me that.""

""It's about twenty minutes out of town, overlooking the river. They have a fine selection of real ales and I highly recommend the Caesar salad.""

During the ride in a Bentley, Katie was the quietist K had ever seen her. She exchanged enough texts with Harry's mother to establish that Robbie was inside playing computer games and make her promise not to let him go outside until she'd heard back. Then she directed a look at K that said - do I really need to ask? It was K, though, so, after leaning close enough that their delivery driver couldn't hear, she put it into words.

""Are you going to tell me what the bloody hell's going on?""

""I'm not entirely sure... I'm...""

""Don't say it! You must know something, like... who is this guy?""

""Some kind of lord, I think.""

""What the does a bloody lord want to see you for? And what the fuck does that have to do with me?""

""I don't..."" K was trembling and, realising that he was as scared as she was angry, Katie stopped asking questions and held his hand for the rest of the journey.

His silhouette framed by a large bay window, he was sat alone with his back to them when the chauffeur spoke into his ear, before heading towards the bar via K and Katie, a reassuring smile for her alone. The well-dressed, slightly heavy-set man rose from his seat and approached them. Framed by a halo of midday sunshine, a handsome, if weathered, face greeted them with a warm smile, apologised for the vital urgency that circumstances had imposed on them all, and offered to buy them a recompensable lunch. Although the accent contained a heavy dose of country gentleman, there were significant undertones of a more distant upbringing. K had been right, though, he was some kind of lord.

Once seated, with their backs to the light, in a reversal of the standard interrogation technique K suspected that, along with the hospitality, was intended to put them at a ease, Valentin Tereshkov signalled for the waitress. His appetite lost to the uncertainty of the Russian's intentions, K stuck to the snacks and opted for numbness over sharpness in the form of a pint of Old Man's Crypt. Katie took the chauffeur's recommendation and the Caesar salad lived up to it's billing, but the unordered starter did taper her own appetite to some extent. Although more familiar with each other's genitals than she would have liked, she failed to recognise him at first, bereft of his gold chain and baseball cap and with his eyes cast down in a demeanour more suited to a sombre church service than a hip hop video. ""Joe, may I introduce you to my son, Dmitri. Katya, I believe you've already had the... well, pleasure's hardly the right word, is it?"" Before the kopek dropped, she'd stared at him long enough for the three of them to wonder if it ever would, and, when it did, her mouth soon followed, but before it could find the words to respond, Tereshkov prompted his embarrassed son. ""Mitka, do you have something to say to Katya?""

""My behaviour...,"" he began, and stopped to take a big breath. ""My shameful behaviour was... completely unbecoming of an honourable gentleman...""

""Look at Katya when you are talking to her,"" Tereshkov interjected. Even more embarrassed by the way his father was talking to him in front of strangers - probably not for the first time, K suspected - and powerless to do anything about it, he raised his head and forced himself to meet her eyes. If only for the sake of their host, Katie reciprocated in kind.

""It was disrespectful to you, to myself and to my family. I sincerely apologise for the way I treated you and I hope you can forgive me."" Her muscles relaxing as the nervous tension left her body, it took all the self-control she could muster to stop herself laughing at the child-like contrition on display, and the patience of father and son must have barely outlasted the time it took her to tame those instincts enough to respond with a straight face.

""That was... unexpected but appreciated. Forgiveness isn't something that's always come easy for me but my son recently taught me a lesson about its importance so, yes, I forgive you."" She thought about apologising herself, for punching him in the groin, but it didn't seem like the right moment to be giving up a position of strength. Tereshkov waved his son away from the table. ""That was very good of you, Katya, thank you.""

""Please, I'm off duty now, would you call me Katie,"" she said, as a fresh pot of coffee and K's ale were served. He quickly took and inch and a half off the top and wiped the foam off his mouth with the back of his hand.

""Katie it is, and you can call me Val. You know, every good parent desires a child that can teach *them* a thing or two, but for your son to be doing so already is a credit to you.""

""I can't take all the credit, but thank you. He's very bright for his age but he can still be a little bastard sometimes."" Not wanting Tereshkov to bring up his own, recently dismissed, little bastard, she added - ""Do you have any other children?"" She sipped her coffee and began to relax into herself, as if the two of them had just met under completely normal circumstances. K could tell she was already falling for the charismatic Russian and took another big sip of his ale.

""Two more boys, both older than Dmitri, but they were never as much trouble. Alexei is my eldest and will always be special to me. He's taken his monastic vows and is living in the middle of nowhere - I haven't seen him for ten years. Ivan is a very intelligent man and a great businessman - he will ensure my early retirement. Between us, we have tried to keep Dmitri sober enough to learn a thing or two but, as Socrates said, 'I only wish that wisdom were the kind of thing that flowed, from the vessel that was full to the one that was empty'.""

""Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed,"" said K, almost to himself and mostly against his will. He had let his growing jealousy of Tereshkov get the better of him. Katie looked embarrassed for him, or ashamed of him, or both, and he felt like sliding under the table. He was about to apologise when his host started to chuckle and spoke directly to K for the first time.

""That's funny because I have three sons - one I particularly miss, one who's a lovely little thinker, and one who's a bugger when he's pissed."" They both laughed while Katie swapped *men, huh?* glances with the waitress serving her food and, like a pair of schoolboys, the two of them traded Monty Python routines while she ate.

When K finished his drink, he was quickly offered another. He felt Katie kicking him under the table and settled for a coffee instead. ""Allow me,"" Tereshkov insisted. ""Katie?... You know, Michael Palin is a very nice man, I met him while I was reading economics at Oxford University. This was when I first arrived in this country after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It's hard to believe that was over thirty years ago - time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana... Now, concerning the whereabouts of our old friend, Abel Broker...""

""You know Broker?"" said Katie. Tereshkov looked from her to K and back again.

""We were well acquainted until quite recently.""

""That makes two of us. I don't wish to speak ill of your friend but, to be honest, his whereabouts don't concern me in the slightest. In fact, I don't care if I never see him again - he cost me my job.""

""Yes, that's a shame... You know, after my son's appalling behaviour, the least I can do is get you a job.""

""You can get me a job?""

""If that's what you want.""

""What sort of job?""

""What do you want to do?""

""I don't know, what do you have in mind?""

""I don't have anything in mind, what do you have in mind? What's your ambition?""

""Well, I always wanted to be an actress, but with one thing and another...""

""I'm sure that can be arranged, leave me your number and I'll have someone call you.""

""Wait a minute, Val, are we talking about pornography, here?""

""Is that what you want to do?""

""No.""

""Then we're not talking about pornography. What sort of acting *do* you want to do?""

""Anything except pornography... or medical dramas."" They exchanged phone numbers.

""It was a pleasure to meet you Katie, and I don't mean to be rude, but would you mind waiting in the car for a few minutes? I have something I need to discuss with Joe.""

""Not at all, Val, it was pleasure to meet you, too."" She left still sceptical about her job prospects, but happy that the impromptu lunch hadn't turned out as bad as it looked like it might when she'd first got into that Bentley.

Tereshkov leaned back in his chair and looked at K like he was a road map, as if he knew exactly where he wanted to go but was uncertain how to get there. K guessed as much, but was uncertain whether Tereshkov was angry at his own uncertainty or enjoying the novelty of it. There were only two things that *were* certain - first, the classic comedy appreciation society meeting was now adjourned and, second, in this battle of nerves there was only going to be one winner. ""I don't know where he is, I swear. All he told me was that he had to see a friend to borrow some money so he could disappear. That was the last I saw of him, Mr Tereshkov. I promise you, if I knew where he was, I'd tell you, please believe me...""

""She doesn't know anything, does she?""

""Katie? She hasn't seen him since... well, you know...""

""I mean about Titorelli Close.""

""I haven't told her anything about that. She thinks it was a car accident like everyone else, and, with all due respect, Mr Tereshkov, I'd like to keep it that way.""

""On that we are in agreement, but at the moment your knowledge is more important to me than her ignorance - tell be about Titorelli Close."" K filled in all the details that Dmitri couldn't have told him. He even gave him the one piece of information he hadn't told either Goolie or Womble and Wire, the thing he would be most interested in, the name of the man who'd hired Broker, the man who he thought he had in his pocket - Lord McQuarrie. Even that failed to elicit any significant response from his suddenly humourless host.

""Who told you all this?"" was all he said.

""Broker, of course,"" said K, as if stating the obvious. Tereshkov was a man whose patience could only occasionally be stretched as far as repeating himself, and then only once, and exclusively for clarification. To make this point, he leaned forward, forced K to meet his eyes, and pointed at him twice to provide extra emphasis to the extra emphasised, extra personal pronoun.

""Who told *you* what *you* told Broker?"" As charming as Tereshkov was, he was also the most powerful, frightening and - in all probability - ruthless man that K had ever met in his life, and he'd just asked him a direct question. How could he not give up Womble?... But, how could he give up Bungo? Where else *could* have got that information?

""Nobody told me.""

""You mean you just accidentally stumbled across it, something like that?""

""Exactly like that. I was arrested a while back and since then I... haven't been well.""

""I read the papers, Joe, I know all about your arrest and your mental health issues, please get to the point.""

""I was suffering from paranoid delusions, and I came to believe that my lawyer's secretary was trying to kill him. It was a preposterous idea but I believed it enough to search her office for evidence. During this futile search I happened across some confidential correspondence with another of the law firms clients - the girl Stone assaulted. That's how I found out about Titorelli Close. Broker had already introduced me to Stone so, when I found out he had flat on that very same street, I went to his house and confronted him about it. He told me everything - more than he needed to, really, it was like he just needed to get it all off his chest.""

""Yes, what happened to that girl seems to have... effected him. Well, I guess it all makes sense now. Go on, best not to keep the young lady waiting... oh, by the way, what's the name of that law firm?""

""Ohm's Law.""

Katie didn't appear to be in any rush. The chauffeur and her were both leaning against the Bentley, blowing smoke rings in the air and flirting with each other, when K walked up, unable to hide his relief at getting out of there in one piece. She sat up front on the way back to the school and enjoyed an easy, free-flowing conversation with the driver, even pausing now and then to listen to him, while K fumed with jealousy on the back seat. Transferred to the Mini, she misread his silence.

""So, what happened back there? What did he want to talk to you about?""

""He just wanted to know if I had any idea where Broker is.""

""And do you?""

""Why would I?""

""Alright, no need to get so defensive. I think I have a right to ask a few questions after being kidnapped, don't you?""

""Kidnapped, huh? So what was that in the Bentley, Stockholm Syndrome?""

""He's cute, OK, we hit it off - I am single now, remember? So Broker owes this Russian loan shark a lot of money, and he's skipped town, right?""

""Right.""

""And what does this have to do with you?""

""I was the last person to see him before he left, he was packing his bags when I was there.""

""And you didn't tell me this at the time 'cause... you thought I'd go running after him and be all like 'Oh, Abe, you poor thing, take me with you, I love you' or some shit? Well, you're wrong, I don't give fuck. People make their own decisions and they have to live with the consequences, especially people like Abel Broker. I knew you were keeping something from me. Alright, I know you thought you were doing it for my own good but you shouldn't keep things bottled up like that, it's not good for you. You're my butty, Joe, so if anything's bothering you, whatever it is, whether it's got anything to do with me or not, you can always talk to me, alright?...""

""Alright... actually...""

""Actually, there is one thing I don't want you to ever talk about again - that bloody arsehole, Broker."" That makes two of us, thought K, although he couldn't help feeling that, one way or another, that might just be wishful thinking. Then he wondered if that black helicopter had followed the Bentley as well as the Mini. ""While we were waiting for you, I texted Harry's mum. She didn't even ask what *that* was all about - I *like* her. Robbie's gonna have a sleepover and she'll drop them both off at school in the morning. So, do want to come over later?""

""I'd love to, what did you have in mind?""

""Well, after watching you and your pal Val earlier, I probably know about as much of the script as you do, but how about *Life of Brian*? - I could do with a laugh.""

After singing along with the end credits, K was feeling unusually optimistic about Goolie's chances when they turned on the regional news special. Under an inappropriately flirtatious Greta Green interviewing a defiantly blameless Archie Johnson, the rolling banner delivered the news that K's messiah had been defeated by a naughty boy called Tom Bliss. ""I've met her,"" was Katie's attempt to break the awkward silence. ""She turned up at the club with a cameraman about a year ago and acted all shocked and offended when they wouldn't let her film inside, as if the rules don't apply to airhead reporters. Then she collared me when I went outside for some fresh air and was really keen to do an interview, until she found out I wasn't really Ukrainian and definitely wasn't a victim of human trafficking.""

""That's a shame,"" said K, sarcastically. ""You could've been on the telly.""

""Yeah, Robbie would've loved that, school would've been so much fun for him,"" she replied in kind, before earnestly adding - ""At least I don't have to worry about that any more."" She put a consoling arm around K and passed him the spliff she'd just relit. ""Always look on the bright side, right - at least we didn't we didn't get this prick.""

K took three long drags while the prick finished his audition for reselection and, after ten minutes of tedious studio analysis we were back with Greta Green, her new hairstyle suggesting that she hadn't needed the host to remind her that the country's focus was on Glowbridge tonight. This time she was joined by Tom Bliss. With no mainstream media coverage, the independent candidate had managed to galvanise support through a social media campaign that K, obviously, and Katie, somehow, had completely missed. ""Congratulations,"" said Greta. ""With such a competitive field, including the hottest - *two* of the hottest - prospects in Britannian politics, you must be very surprised to be winning like this. How do you feel?""

""First of all, Greta, I need to thank my amazing team. As you just eluded to, taking even one seat away from the main parties in a structurally undemocratic first-past-the-post system, that ignores most of our votes and stifles any meaningful change, is a remarkable achievement.""

""That's uh..."" Greta looked confused and put her finger to her earpiece. ""So you're an advocate of propositional representation?""

""I'm an advocate of universal self-representation. This is the first step in establishing a coalition of independent MPs dedicated to repairing our country's failing political system.""

""What's wrong with it?"" said Greta. She winced - the voice in her ear was clearly not impressed with the question.

""What's not wrong with it? Let's think about who actually runs the show...""

""Communist!""

""Maybe you'd be more comfortable without that thing in your ear, Greta. Then we can have a perfectly civilised conversation without someone telling you what to say - I'm sure your viewers would prefer it that way.""

""Please continue,"" she said, pulling the earpiece out and defiantly staring down whoever was behind the camera. ""I think you were about to explain who runs the show - the last time I checked, it was the prime minister.""

""The prime minister routinely distributes power to a series of unqualified idiots, rushing to make a name for themselves before the next cabinet reshuffle gives them another job they can't do properly. These idiots come up with hugely expensive, ill-thought-out, unscrutinised proposals...""

""That's what parliament does, though - scrutinises their proposals,"" said Greta.

""That's what it's meant to do, yes, but these proposals are written to be incoherent and incomplete - missing relevant information and stuffed with unnecessary gobbledegook. It would be hard to effectively scrutinise them even if the already overworked MPs weren't also dealing with constituency business and travelling back and forth to London all the time. In a situation like this, is it any wonder that most of them end up voting whatever way their party wants them to vote? After all, if they have any ambition to be an unqualified idiot in a nice job one day, they're going to have to do just that. Meanwhile, in a majority government, whatever the current unqualified idiot wants the current unqualified idiot gets and it's left to the unelected, unaccountable second chamber to provide the scrutiny that our elected officials are incapable of doing. Whatever we believe in, whatever disagreements we might have with our neighbours, the one thing we should all be able to agree on right now is this - our political system is a massive waste of taxpayers money that is fundamentally unfit for purpose.""

""And what do you believe in, Mr Bliss? What are *your* proposals... on healthcare?... on education?""

""I believe in doctors - I want to hear *their* proposals on healthcare. I believe in teachers - I want to hear *their* proposals on education. I believe I'm an unqualified idiot and I propose that we stop letting unqualified idiots make proposals about things they don't know anything about.""

""If you don't mind me saying, you're a very ambitious idiot, Mr Bliss. It's only your first day on the job and you're already planning to burn the house down. But what are you planning to build in its place - what's your ultimate goal?""

""My ultimate goal is to make my new job obsolete. We already have the technology to become the first truly democratic country in history, all we need is the will. How would you like your voice to be heard, Greta? Not the voice in your ear, or the voice in the ear of the person whose name you put a cross next to every five years, but *your voice*?""

""What are you talking about?""

""We're talking about a *People's Parliament*. We're talking about every single one of us being able to vote on any proposal we want to vote on. We're talking about every single one of us having a direct say in the sort of country we want to live in. Doesn't that sound like a democracy to you?""

""It sounds like complete chaos. How would that even work?""

""The system we have now is chaos - I've barely scratched the surface with you here. What we're proposing is much simpler. Everyone over twenty-one is automatically registered as an MPP with full access to the website and the right to vote on any proposal that's up for a national vote - you don't even need a permanent address or a bank account, as long as you can get to a public library, you're in. Everyone with a relevant job or qualification is also allowed to make any proposal they want within their field of expertise - so teachers on education, nurses on healthcare etc. Then this is how it works - (1), a proposal is posted in the relevant forum, (2), the proposal is debated within it's field by any expert who wants to get involved, (3), the proposal is voted on by any expert who wants to, and if it wins the vote it moves forward to a national debate, (4), anyone who's signed up to receive a relevant alert, and anyone else who checks the current list of proposals, can get involved in the debate if they want to, and (5), the proposal is put to a national vote. There may be a few details to sort out but, two millennia after that first Greek experiment, democracy is finally within our reach - we just have to be brave enough to reach out and grab it.""

""And no more politicians? no more elections?""

""Doesn't that sound great? Of course, we'll still need someone to do the admin but, if I end my political career as a bank clerk, I'll die a happy man.""

""We'll have to leave it there, but thanks for talking to us, Mr Bliss...""

""Don't forget to seek out the *People's Parliament* candidates in the next general election,"" he said to camera. ""Your time is coming."" It cut back to the studio where everyone was in agreement that Glowbridge had just become the biggest joke in Britannian politics. The host urged everyone to contact Tom Bliss and ask him what he's going to do about their *actual* problems. Then he told them to pray for their town and wished them a good night. Katie looked at K.

""Maybe you should contact Tom Bliss,"" she said. ""You could ask him to put your case to a national vote."" Which is exactly what happened in a dream he had that night - it didn't go well for him. His crucifixion took place outside the town hall and thousands of enthusiastic spectators had turned up, including Katie, Broker, Dr Sinha, Ma Rheaney, Valentin Tereshkov, Goolie, Stone, Veronica, Ohm, Dee, Womble and Wire. Zephyr drove the nails in before Greta Green replaced him on K's father's old window cleaning ladder and put a microphone in his face. ""You must be very surprised to be dying like this,"" she said. ""How do you feel?""

""Like a God,"" he said.",1,1741590777.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

But I will say that I really want to be caffeine free.  However, Friday I sat at my desk for hours staring at a long to-do list and urgent deadlines and got remarkably little done.  I wanted to get going on that high priority item, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get my head in gear.  This is always the problem.  I always have an excuse for why it‚Äôs okay, just this once.

Now, I am not going to pretend that caffeine consumption is on the same level as alcohol, nicotine, meth or heroine addiction.  I find it ridiculous when people try to suggest that kind of nonsense.  It‚Äôs not the same and we all know it.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs own kind of problematic addiction.  As the title of my post suggests, I‚Äôm now facing the consequence of my decision from nearly 18 hours ago when I woke up after a bad night of sleep because of a decision I made about 24 hours earlier and an earlier bad night of sleep.

The cycle continues.  And tomorrow (actually later this morning) I‚Äôm going to wake up tired because I‚Äôm not sleeping now and I‚Äôll stare at my to-do list and the inevitable decision will have to be made again.  Do I get a cup of coffee and power through so I can earn an income or do I stare at my computer screen wanting to be productive but knowing I‚Äôll just have to be satisfied with whatever I can manage to check off again at an uninspired pace after spinning my wheels for hours trying to convince myself that my body was designed to not require caffeine.

Well, there you go, the erratic ravings of a caffeine addled insomniac at 3 AM (which should be 2 AM but of course we can‚Äôt figure out how to stop changing the clock twice a year).  At least I‚Äôve gone and made myself tired, maybe.",1,1741590763.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1j7syuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1j7syuc/joe_k_part_21/,Joe K - Part 21,"On the day of the by-election, Katie made the school run minus the schoolboy and plus K. For thirty years, the act of voting had been a routine exercise undertaken more to satisfy his mother's unwavering commitment to the democratic process than a projection of any personal ideology, but today it felt like he was at the casino putting everything on red. The queue outside could have been bad timing, but he hoped it was indicative of a good turnout - it didn't seem likely, somehow, that people would be rushing out to vote for Archie Johnson.

While they were both waiting for one of the two booths to empty, K looked around and spotted a zephyr right behind them with his hood up, as if taking the idea of a secret ballot one step further. Luckily, he was also looking behind, so didn't see K's face. He needed him to be in the other booth when he left his or it would be impossible for them to avoid acknowledging each other's existence, so he made sure Katie went first.

In the relative safety of the booth, K put an X next to Pearl Goolie's name and stared at it for a few seconds with his fingers crossed - first wishing her good luck, then wishing he'd taken a leaping pill so he could believe in luck, then remembering there was no such thing as leaping pills and wishing there was so he could wish he'd taken one so he could wish her good luck, and finally laughing at himself and folding the ballot paper. He was still smiling when he turned around and looked straight at the zephyr, who smiled back a full set of teeth. With a sigh of relief and an awkward greeting, he skipped passed and exercised his right into the ballot box so forcefully he had to mouth an apology to the returning officer. ""What were you laughing at?"" said Katie, when she joined him outside and they began to walk back to the car.

""Just nerves, I guess. What took you so long?""

""I was just looking at all the names, I didn't realise there was so many different teams to be honest. We're the favourites though, right?""

""It's not Wales in the rugby league.""

""The rugby league?""

""Is that not a thing?""

""It is, but I'm not sure it's the thing you think it is, do you mean...?""

""How long have you had a driver?"" he interrupted. The classically, and immaculately, attired chauffeur was juxtaposed against Katie's red Mini, absent-mindedly smoking a cigarette. She skipped ahead of K and went straight on the attack.

""Oi, what the bloody hell do you think you're doing sitting on my baby?""

""Please forgive me, madam,"" he said with an upper-class accent and subservient disposition that perfectly suited his appearance. ""I seem to have forgotten my manners."" He stood up straight, discarded his cigarette, and looked down at Katie from an six or seven inch advantage.

""Mademoiselle, if you don't mind, and if this is voter intimidation, you're a bit late.""

""With respect, mademoiselle, I would have to disagree - it's far too early in our relationship for intimate dating.""

""In that case... is it too late to change my vote?""

""Good morning, sir,"" he said to Katie's knight in shining armour, who was brave enough to catch up now that her initial cavalry charge had been parried with playful jousting. After K defensively returned his greeting, he addressed them both. ""My employer sends his apologies for the inconvenience, but you are to join him for lunch."" As far as Katie was concerned, he had just committed a sin that no degree of charm could atone for. All the men in her life, both personally and professionally, soon learn that you can ask her anything once, but don't ever tell her what to do.

""No thanks,"" she said. ""I've got to pick my son up, so if you don't mind getting your fat arse out of my way.""

""This is incorrect. My employer informs me that your son is at a friend's house and you don't have to pick him up until four o'clock. I have been instructed to assure you, on his behalf, that we will be back here in two or three hours, which gives us plenty of time... and my arse is not fat.""

""Please,"" said K. ""It's me he wants to talk to, there's no need to drag her into this. Let her go and I'll come with you."" In return for the most gallant act in his short tenure as Katie's knight, he received the coldest look she'd ever given him.

""My instructions are clear, sir, both yourself and the mademoiselle are to accompany me.""

""Could you, at least, tell us where we're going?"" said Katie, feeling that K's intervention had now obligated her to offer her full cooperation.

""The Bridge Inn, mademoiselle, do you know it?""

""No, where is it? - and stop calling me that.""

""It's about twenty minutes out of town, overlooking the river. They have a fine selection of real ales and I highly recommend the Caesar salad.""

During the ride in a Bentley, Katie was the quietist K had ever seen her. She exchanged enough texts with Harry's mother to establish that Robbie was inside playing computer games and make her promise not to let him go outside until she'd heard back. Then she directed a look at K that said - do I really need to ask? It was K, though, so, after leaning close enough that their delivery driver couldn't hear, she put it into words.

""Are you going to tell me what the bloody hell's going on?""

""I'm not entirely sure... I'm...""

""Don't say it! You must know something, like... who is this guy?""

""Some kind of lord, I think.""

""What the does a bloody lord want to see you for? And what the fuck does that have to do with me?""

""I don't..."" K was trembling and, realising that he was as scared as she was angry, Katie stopped asking questions and held his hand for the rest of the journey.

His silhouette framed by a large bay window, he was sat alone with his back to them when the chauffeur spoke into his ear, before heading towards the bar via K and Katie, a reassuring smile for her alone. The well-dressed, slightly heavy-set man rose from his seat and approached them. Framed by a halo of midday sunshine, a handsome, if weathered, face greeted them with a warm smile, apologised for the vital urgency that circumstances had imposed on them all, and offered to buy them a recompensable lunch. Although the accent contained a heavy dose of country gentleman, there were significant undertones of a more distant upbringing. K had been right, though, he was some kind of lord.

Once seated, with their backs to the light, in a reversal of the standard interrogation technique K suspected that, along with the hospitality, was intended to put them at a ease, Valentin Tereshkov signalled for the waitress. His appetite lost to the uncertainty of the Russian's intentions, K stuck to the snacks and opted for numbness over sharpness in the form of a pint of Old Man's Crypt. Katie took the chauffeur's recommendation and the Caesar salad lived up to it's billing, but the unordered starter did taper her own appetite to some extent. Although more familiar with each other's genitals than she would have liked, she failed to recognise him at first, bereft of his gold chain and baseball cap and with his eyes cast down in a demeanour more suited to a sombre church service than a hip hop video. ""Joe, may I introduce you to my son, Dmitri. Katya, I believe you've already had the... well, pleasure's hardly the right word, is it?"" Before the kopek dropped, she'd stared at him long enough for the three of them to wonder if it ever would, and, when it did, her mouth soon followed, but before it could find the words to respond, Tereshkov prompted his embarrassed son. ""Mitka, do you have something to say to Katya?""

""My behaviour...,"" he began, and stopped to take a big breath. ""My shameful behaviour was... completely unbecoming of an honourable gentleman...""

""Look at Katya when you are talking to her,"" Tereshkov interjected. Even more embarrassed by the way his father was talking to him in front of strangers - probably not for the first time, K suspected - and powerless to do anything about it, he raised his head and forced himself to meet her eyes. If only for the sake of their host, Katie reciprocated in kind.

""It was disrespectful to you, to myself and to my family. I sincerely apologise for the way I treated you and I hope you can forgive me."" Her muscles relaxing as the nervous tension left her body, it took all the self-control she could muster to stop herself laughing at the child-like contrition on display, and the patience of father and son must have barely outlasted the time it took her to tame those instincts enough to respond with a straight face.

""That was... unexpected but appreciated. Forgiveness isn't something that's always come easy for me but my son recently taught me a lesson about its importance so, yes, I forgive you."" She thought about apologising herself, for punching him in the groin, but it didn't seem like the right moment to be giving up a position of strength. Tereshkov waved his son away from the table. ""That was very good of you, Katya, thank you.""

""Please, I'm off duty now, would you call me Katie,"" she said, as a fresh pot of coffee and K's ale were served. He quickly took and inch and a half off the top and wiped the foam off his mouth with the back of his hand.

""Katie it is, and you can call me Val. You know, every good parent desires a child that can teach *them* a thing or two, but for your son to be doing so already is a credit to you.""

""I can't take all the credit, but thank you. He's very bright for his age but he can still be a little bastard sometimes."" Not wanting Tereshkov to bring up his own, recently dismissed, little bastard, she added - ""Do you have any other children?"" She sipped her coffee and began to relax into herself, as if the two of them had just met under completely normal circumstances. K could tell she was already falling for the charismatic Russian and took another big sip of his ale.

""Two more boys, both older than Dmitri, but they were never as much trouble. Alexei is my eldest and will always be special to me. He's taken his monastic vows and is living in the middle of nowhere - I haven't seen him for ten years. Ivan is a very intelligent man and a great businessman - he will ensure my early retirement. Between us, we have tried to keep Dmitri sober enough to learn a thing or two but, as Socrates said, 'I only wish that wisdom were the kind of thing that flowed, from the vessel that was full to the one that was empty'.""

""Socrates, himself, was permanently pissed,"" said K, almost to himself and mostly against his will. He had let his growing jealousy of Tereshkov get the better of him. Katie looked embarrassed for him, or ashamed of him, or both, and he felt like sliding under the table. He was about to apologise when his host started to chuckle and spoke directly to K for the first time.

""That's funny because I have three sons - one I particularly miss, one who's a lovely little thinker, and one who's a bugger when he's pissed."" They both laughed while Katie swapped *men, huh?* glances with the waitress serving her food and, like a pair of schoolboys, the two of them traded Monty Python routines while she ate.

When K finished his drink, he was quickly offered another. He felt Katie kicking him under the table and settled for a coffee instead. ""Allow me,"" Tereshkov insisted. ""Katie?... You know, Michael Palin is a very nice man, I met him while I was reading economics at Oxford University. This was when I first arrived in this country after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It's hard to believe that was over thirty years ago - time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana... Now, concerning the whereabouts of our old friend, Abel Broker...""

""You know Broker?"" said Katie. Tereshkov looked from her to K and back again.

""We were well acquainted until quite recently.""

""That makes two of us. I don't wish to speak ill of your friend but, to be honest, his whereabouts don't concern me in the slightest. In fact, I don't care if I never see him again - he cost me my job.""

""Yes, that's a shame... You know, after my son's appalling behaviour, the least I can do is get you a job.""

""You can get me a job?""

""If that's what you want.""

""What sort of job?""

""What do you want to do?""

""I don't know, what do you have in mind?""

""I don't have anything in mind, what do you have in mind? What's your ambition?""

""Well, I always wanted to be an actress, but with one thing and another...""

""I'm sure that can be arranged, leave me your number and I'll have someone call you.""

""Wait a minute, Val, are we talking about pornography, here?""

""Is that what you want to do?""

""No.""

""Then we're not talking about pornography. What sort of acting *do* you want to do?""

""Anything except pornography... or medical dramas."" They exchanged phone numbers.

""It was a pleasure to meet you Katie, and I don't mean to be rude, but would you mind waiting in the car for a few minutes? I have something I need to discuss with Joe.""

""Not at all, Val, it was pleasure to meet you, too."" She left still sceptical about her job prospects, but happy that the impromptu lunch hadn't turned out as bad as it looked like it might when she'd first got into that Bentley.

Tereshkov leaned back in his chair and looked at K like he was a road map, as if he knew exactly where he wanted to go but was uncertain how to get there. K guessed as much, but was uncertain whether Tereshkov was angry at his own uncertainty or enjoying the novelty of it. There were only two things that *were* certain - first, the classic comedy appreciation society meeting was now adjourned and, second, in this battle of nerves there was only going to be one winner. ""I don't know where he is, I swear. All he told me was that he had to see a friend to borrow some money so he could disappear. That was the last I saw of him, Mr Tereshkov. I promise you, if I knew where he was, I'd tell you, please believe me...""

""She doesn't know anything, does she?""

""Katie? She hasn't seen him since... well, you know...""

""I mean about Titorelli Close.""

""I haven't told her anything about that. She thinks it was a car accident like everyone else, and, with all due respect, Mr Tereshkov, I'd like to keep it that way.""

""On that we are in agreement, but at the moment your knowledge is more important to me than her ignorance - tell be about Titorelli Close."" K filled in all the details that Dmitri couldn't have told him. He even gave him the one piece of information he hadn't told either Goolie or Womble and Wire, the thing he would be most interested in, the name of the man who'd hired Broker, the man who he thought he had in his pocket - Lord McQuarrie. Even that failed to elicit any significant response from his suddenly humourless host.

""Who told you all this?"" was all he said.

""Broker, of course,"" said K, as if stating the obvious. Tereshkov was a man whose patience could only occasionally be stretched as far as repeating himself, and then only once, and exclusively for clarification. To make this point, he leaned forward, forced K to meet his eyes, and pointed at him twice to provide extra emphasis to the extra emphasised, extra personal pronoun.

""Who told *you* what *you* told Broker?"" As charming as Tereshkov was, he was also the most powerful, frightening and - in all probability - ruthless man that K had ever met in his life, and he'd just asked him a direct question. How could he not give up Womble?... But, how could he give up Bungo? Where else *could* have got that information?

""Nobody told me.""

""You mean you just accidentally stumbled across it, something like that?""

""Exactly like that. I was arrested a while back and since then I... haven't been well.""

""I read the papers, Joe, I know all about your arrest and your mental health issues, please get to the point.""

""I was suffering from paranoid delusions, and I came to believe that my lawyer's secretary was trying to kill him. It was a preposterous idea but I believed it enough to search her office for evidence. During this futile search I happened across some confidential correspondence with another of the law firms clients - the girl Stone assaulted. That's how I found out about Titorelli Close. Broker had already introduced me to Stone so, when I found out he had flat on that very same street, I went to his house and confronted him about it. He told me everything - more than he needed to, really, it was like he just needed to get it all off his chest.""

""Yes, what happened to that girl seems to have... effected him. Well, I guess it all makes sense now. Go on, best not to keep the young lady waiting... oh, by the way, what's the name of that law firm?""

""Ohm's Law.""

Katie didn't appear to be in any rush. The chauffeur and her were both leaning against the Bentley, blowing smoke rings in the air and flirting with each other, when K walked up, unable to hide his relief at getting out of there in one piece. She sat up front on the way back to the school and enjoyed an easy, free-flowing conversation with the driver, even pausing now and then to listen to him, while K fumed with jealousy on the back seat. Transferred to the Mini, she misread his silence.

""So, what happened back there? What did he want to talk to you about?""

""He just wanted to know if I had any idea where Broker is.""

""And do you?""

""Why would I?""

""Alright, no need to get so defensive. I think I have a right to ask a few questions after being kidnapped, don't you?""

""Kidnapped, huh? So what was that in the Bentley, Stockholm Syndrome?""

""He's cute, OK, we hit it off - I am single now, remember? So Broker owes this Russian loan shark a lot of money, and he's skipped town, right?""

""Right.""

""And what does this have to do with you?""

""I was the last person to see him before he left, he was packing his bags when I was there.""

""And you didn't tell me this at the time 'cause... you thought I'd go running after him and be all like 'Oh, Abe, you poor thing, take me with you, I love you' or some shit? Well, you're wrong, I don't give fuck. People make their own decisions and they have to live with the consequences, especially people like Abel Broker. I knew you were keeping something from me. Alright, I know you thought you were doing it for my own good but you shouldn't keep things bottled up like that, it's not good for you. You're my butty, Joe, so if anything's bothering you, whatever it is, whether it's got anything to do with me or not, you can always talk to me, alright?...""

""Alright... actually...""

""Actually, there is one thing I don't want you to ever talk about again - that bloody arsehole, Broker."" That makes two of us, thought K, although he couldn't help feeling that, one way or another, that might just be wishful thinking. Then he wondered if that black helicopter had followed the Bentley as well as the Mini. ""While we were waiting for you, I texted Harry's mum. She didn't even ask what *that* was all about - I *like* her. Robbie's gonna have a sleepover and she'll drop them both off at school in the morning. So, do want to come over later?""

""I'd love to, what did you have in mind?""

""Well, after watching you and your pal Val earlier, I probably know about as much of the script as you do, but how about *Life of Brian*? - I could do with a laugh.""

After singing along with the end credits, K was feeling unusually optimistic about Goolie's chances when they turned on the regional news special. Under an inappropriately flirtatious Greta Green interviewing a defiantly blameless Archie Johnson, the rolling banner delivered the news that K's messiah had been defeated by a naughty boy called Tom Bliss. ""I've met her,"" was Katie's attempt to break the awkward silence. ""She turned up at the club with a cameraman about a year ago and acted all shocked and offended when they wouldn't let her film inside, as if the rules don't apply to airhead reporters. Then she collared me when I went outside for some fresh air and was really keen to do an interview, until she found out I wasn't really Ukrainian and definitely wasn't a victim of human trafficking.""

""That's a shame,"" said K, sarcastically. ""You could've been on the telly.""

""Yeah, Robbie would've loved that, school would've been so much fun for him,"" she replied in kind, before earnestly adding - ""At least I don't have to worry about that any more."" She put a consoling arm around K and passed him the spliff she'd just relit. ""Always look on the bright side, right - at least we didn't we didn't get this prick.""

K took three long drags while the prick finished his audition for reselection and, after ten minutes of tedious studio analysis we were back with Greta Green, her new hairstyle suggesting that she hadn't needed the host to remind her that the country's focus was on Glowbridge tonight. This time she was joined by Tom Bliss. With no mainstream media coverage, the independent candidate had managed to galvanise support through a social media campaign that K, obviously, and Katie, somehow, had completely missed. ""Congratulations,"" said Greta. ""With such a competitive field, including the hottest - *two* of the hottest - prospects in Britannian politics, you must be very surprised to be winning like this. How do you feel?""

""First of all, Greta, I need to thank my amazing team. As you just eluded to, taking even one seat away from the main parties in a structurally undemocratic first-past-the-post system, that ignores most of our votes and stifles any meaningful change, is a remarkable achievement.""

""I'm an advocate of universal self-representation. This is the first step in establishing a coalition of independent MPs dedicated to repairing our country's failing political system.""

""What's wrong with it?"" said Greta. She winced - the voice in her ear was clearly not impressed with the question.

""What's not wrong with it? Let's think about who actually runs the show...""

""Communist!""

""Maybe you'd be more comfortable without that thing in your ear, Greta. Then we can have a perfectly civilised conversation without someone telling you what to say - I'm sure your viewers would prefer it that way.""

""Please continue,"" she said, pulling the earpiece out and defiantly staring down whoever was behind the camera. ""I think you were about to explain who runs the show - the last time I checked, it was the prime minister.""

""The prime minister routinely distributes power to a series of unqualified idiots, rushing to make a name for themselves before the next cabinet reshuffle gives them another job they can't do properly. These idiots come up with hugely expensive, ill-thought-out, unscrutinised proposals...""

""That's what parliament does, though - scrutinises their proposals,"" said Greta.

""That's what it's meant to do, yes, but these proposals are written to be incoherent and incomplete - missing relevant information and stuffed with unnecessary gobbledegook.

After all, if they have any ambition to be an unqualified idiot in a nice job one day, they're going to have to do just that.

Whatever we believe in, whatever disagreements we might have with our neighbours, the one thing we should all be able to agree on right now is this - our political system is a massive waste of taxpayers money that is fundamentally unfit for purpose.""

""And what do you believe in, Mr Bliss? What are *your* proposals... on healthcare?... on education?""

""I believe in doctors - I want to hear *their* proposals on healthcare. I believe in teachers - I want to hear *their* proposals on education. I believe I'm an unqualified idiot and I propose that we stop letting unqualified idiots make proposals about things they don't know anything about.""

""If you don't mind me saying, you're a very ambitious idiot, Mr Bliss. It's only your first day on the job and you're already planning to burn the house down. But what are you planning to build in its place - what's your ultimate goal?""

""My ultimate goal is to make my new job obsolete. We already have the technology to become the first truly democratic country in history, all we need is the will. How would you like your voice to be heard, Greta? Not the voice in your ear, or the voice in the ear of the person whose name you put a cross next to every five years, but *your voice*?""

""What are you talking about?""

""We're talking about a *People's Parliament*. We're talking about every single one of us being able to vote on any proposal we want to vote on. We're talking about every single one of us having a direct say in the sort of country we want to live in. Doesn't that sound like a democracy to you?""

""It sounds like complete chaos. How would that even work?""

""The system we have now is chaos - I've barely scratched the surface with you here. What we're proposing is much simpler. Everyone over twenty-one is automatically registered as an MPP with full access to the website and the right to vote on any proposal that's up for a national vote - you don't even need a permanent address or a bank account, as long as you can get to a public library, you're in. Everyone with a relevant job or qualification is also allowed to make any proposal they want within their field of expertise - so teachers on education, nurses on healthcare etc. Then this is how it works - (1), a proposal is posted in the relevant forum, (2), the proposal is debated within it's field by any expert who wants to get involved, (3), the proposal is voted on by any expert who wants to, and if it wins the vote it moves forward to a national debate, (4), anyone who's signed up to receive a relevant alert, and anyone else who checks the current list of proposals, can get involved in the debate if they want to, and (5), the proposal is put to a national vote. There may be a few details to sort out but, two millennia after that first Greek experiment, democracy is finally within our reach - we just have to be brave enough to reach out and grab it.""

""And no more politicians? no more elections?""

""Doesn't that sound great? Of course, we'll still need someone to do the admin but, if I end my political career as a bank clerk, I'll die a happy man.""

""We'll have to leave it there, but thanks for talking to us, Mr Bliss...""

""Don't forget to seek out the *People's Parliament* candidates in the next general election,"" he said to camera. ""Your time is coming."" It cut back to the studio where everyone was in agreement that Glowbridge had just become the biggest joke in Britannian politics. The host urged everyone to contact Tom Bliss and ask him what he's going to do about their *actual* problems. Then he told them to pray for their town and wished them a good night. Katie looked at K.

""Maybe you should contact Tom Bliss,"" she said. ""You could ask him to put your case to a national vote."" Which is exactly what happened in a dream he had that night - it didn't go well for him. His crucifixion took place outside the town hall and thousands of enthusiastic spectators had turned up, including Katie, Broker, Dr Sinha, Ma Rheaney, Valentin Tereshkov, Goolie, Stone, Veronica, Ohm, Dee, Womble and Wire. Zephyr drove the nails in before Greta Green replaced him on K's father's old window cleaning ladder and put a microphone in his face. ""You must be very surprised to be dying like this,"" she said. ""How do you feel?""

1j7sxdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j7sxdh/too_curious/,Too Curious,"What am I doing? There is no medal for being this diligent of an archivist.

I should have left it alone, stopped reading. I should have gone home, cracked open a beer, and watched the Knicks suck some more. I know now that some stories are meant to be forgotten, sealed away in folders to gather dust. But I am curious, too curious, and I kept digging.

At first, I told myself it was just research, an old habit. I‚Äôve always had a thing for the little inconsistencies in official reports, or files buried so deep it felt like someone wanted them lost. Sometimes it‚Äôs nothing, a clerical error, a typo, or someone just got a little too high. But then there are the other cases. The ones that don‚Äôt make sense no matter which way you look at them. Have you ever seen a report where every witness‚Äô statement contradicts itself? One report claimed it was pouring rain; another swore the pavement was dry. In a recording, the same witness described being followed by a tall, well-dressed man, then by a short woman in a Jets jersey. Reports that change every time I read them‚Ä¶ as if someone was live editing. I thought I was losing my mind.

The first time I found one of those, I laughed it off. A hoax, maybe. A weird oversight. I threw it on my discard pile. Then I found another. And another. Different cities, different years, different circumstances but the same kind of changes and inconsistencies‚Äîlike pieces of something bigger.

I should‚Äôve stopped. I see that now.

It wasn‚Äôt until things started happening to me that I realized I wasn‚Äôt just looking at the files. Someone, something was looking back.

I started noticing small things at first. A blueish glow under the front door to the hallway, the clacking of my old typewriter in the closet, a flicker on my laptop screen‚Äînot the usual glitch, but something more intentional, like a frame skipping in a movie. The kind that makes you wonder if you actually saw something or if your brain filled in the blanks.

Then came the phone calls. I‚Äôd answer, and the line would be dead for a moment before a faint clicking sound started, rhythmic, deliberate. Once, I swear I heard breathing before the call disconnected.

I barely sleep anymore. Yesterday, my apartment door was locked from the inside when I knew I left it open. My neighbor, an older guy who barely notices anything, told me someone was standing outside my door last night.

Then today, I got myself a coffee and when I got back to my desk my laptop flickered again. A message typed itself.

*""Are you really ready to see?""*

I didn‚Äôt type that. It creeped me out and I don‚Äôt feel safe anymore.

I shut the laptop. Left my apartment. Walked three blocks in the rain just to convince myself the world was still normal. It‚Äôs not.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming next, but I think I‚Äôve already gone too far.

I need to know‚Äîhas anyone else seen things like this? Not stories‚Äîreal things. Patterns that don‚Äôt make sense. Files that shouldn‚Äôt exist. People who vanish in ways that don‚Äôt fit the reports.

If you have, tell me. Because I don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore.

\-Felix

on February 21st this year I was driving to work and doing the usual routine (listening to deftones and chugging my coffee). I was on a road called steeles and it's insanely packed on that road even for it being 6AM. when i was about 2 feet from the crosswalk of the intersection the light turned yellow and the speed limit was 70 Km/h. , so naturally I cleared the intersection and came to a stop right after the intersection as there was only room for about 3 more cars. That's when homeboy rear ended me and I felt the impact twice somehow. I assume he must've tried clearing the intersection from further back and couldn't slow down in time.

I was taken to the hospital in a stretcher with a neck brace on and they did a CT scan but everything came back okay however, since then I haven't returned to work and have been having insanely intense headaches, neck, back, shoulder pain and I have a hard time concentrating on things and get angry faster than normal (I'm also terrified of driving).

Important thing here is this was my second accident in a week (I was backed into by a snowplough and have been cleared by insurance 100% not at fault) and the rental company wants me to keep this all hush hush cause I guess they want to fix it on their own and sell it with no claims on it. So right now I'm at an important decision, im going to be making my claim tomorrow (February 26th) regardless of the rentals attempts to keep me quiet because I require physio now.

I guess what I'm trying to ask here is I want to sue the other individual for their negligence that has caused me to go through all of this pain and discomfort. based off of my predictions I think I'll be better in 3 months with physio (Could be wrong) but I just want to know if I sue this guy (which first means I have to sue my insurance company for some reason apparently) how much would I be able to get? what should I be expecting in terms of insurance investigating my claim? Only asking because my case isn't as bad as most accidents but I'm still a little messed up, any and all inputs would be welcome and appreciated.
thank you

1j7sqee,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j7sqee/regret_short_story_first_draft/,"Regret (short story, first draft)","Content warning for non-consensual kissing. I wrote this all today, and I would like to polish it into something better. I'm not planning on publishing it or anything, but I would like to get to that point in the future. I apologize for the formatting. It all looks normal in my Google Doc, and I'm not sure what happened in the process of copying and pasting it.

	I lean back against his chest and smile, feeling his arms wrap around me. I lift his hand up and press a kiss to his knuckles before letting go, and he rests it over my heart. He makes a comment about how fast it races, as he always does, and I turn my head to listen.

	‚ÄúYours is, too.‚Äù

	He always has something to say, but now he is quiet. The show we were watching has long since faded into the background, but I tune back in when no thoughts are shared. If I can focus on that, I don‚Äôt have to worry about the confusion and dreaming and lies and self-hatred and lost and confused and-

	He‚Äôs asleep. That means he‚Äôs comfortable. That‚Äôs normal. I smile again, assured in the normalcy of it all. I stare at the TV again as I pull his hand down to rest over my stomach and run my thumb over his. The lull of the dialogue should be enough for me to drift off, but my mind races and my eyes never grow heavy. That‚Äôs normal. Everything is as it should be.

	I look up at him after a while before sitting up. The movement makes him stir, and he looks at me, confused. He‚Äôs always so expressive. It‚Äôs easy for me to interpret.

	‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to get comfortable again.‚Äù

	He nods and asks if I want to move.

	‚ÄúSure!‚Äù

	He stands and takes my hand. We move to his room and lay down together in bed. That‚Äôs normal. I look around at the posters and clutter that I‚Äôve grown familiar with, then look back. He gives me a look that I can‚Äôt read. I stare back before I simply turn around and let him wrap his arms around me again. It‚Äôs a few minutes before we talk again, and I prop my head on my arm. My fingers find my way to my hair and I tug through to the ends over and over, untangling knots that were never there in the first place. My answers are slow and quiet, but he doesn‚Äôt ask. Doesn‚Äôt notice. That‚Äôs normal. I grow aware of my repeated motions, so I turn to face him instead. He adjusts and moves his hand to my arm, running it up and down. He stops sometimes to pull my shirt down, since it occasionally rides up while I shift where I lay. I‚Äôm wearing a tank top underneath, so no skin is ever shown, but it‚Äôs sweet. At some point, he stops and leaves his hand on my waist. He gives me the same look as before.

	I meet his eyes and he glances down, then back up. Is this The Look? I‚Äôve given him The Look before, but I stopped after we talked and agreed that we‚Äôre fine like this. We‚Äôre fine as friends. He never saw me that way to begin with.

	Before I can process, his face is closer to mine and I realize he hasn‚Äôt said a word. I tilt my head up and right with a laugh and smile, and we continue talking as he pulls back, his hand still on my waist. That‚Äôs not normal. I want to ask, but I don‚Äôt.

We carry on. My hand finds its way to my hair, and I forget. Everything is laughs and smiles and the way it should be.

The sun set hours ago. It‚Äôs late. He works in the morning. I need to go home. I don‚Äôt want to leave, so he decides for me. That‚Äôs normal. We take our time getting up, then he follows me out to the living room. He watches as I put on my shoes. I grin as the boots make me a little taller. Not as tall as him, of course, but taller. He says I look good in them. I stand straight after pulling up the zippers, and he gives me that look again. The Look. I stare back for a few seconds before he leans in and his eyes start to close. I tilt my head up and to the right. I smile and laugh.

‚ÄúI should go home. It really is late, and you work tomorrow.‚Äù

He agrees, and we head out to his car.

The ride is quiet except for the love song I play, written by his favorite band and one of my favorite artists. I can‚Äôt read the air. He never turns his head enough for me to see his expression, but he reaches over and takes my hand. I look between him and the window, hoping he‚Äôll give me *something*. Anything. He doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs normal. I smile.

He walks me to my door. That‚Äôs normal. I unlock my door and we say our goodbyes, but he doesn‚Äôt hug me. He hesitates, then leans in and kisses my cheek before rushing down the stairs. That‚Äôs not normal. I stare where he once stood and touch my face, my mind oddly quiet. That‚Äôs normal. I wait for a moment, then go inside. Nobody is awake, of course, so I go straight to bed, only stopping to take off my boots and drop my bag on the floor. It‚Äôs better that way. My friend never liked him.

He said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship. He didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. He‚Äôs an affectionate person. He‚Äôs talking to someone. He doesn‚Äôt know I know that. I‚Äôm getting in the way of a relationship he wants but he has to want me because I‚Äôm here and he tried to kiss me multiple times and I‚Äôm right here and I never pushed because he didn‚Äôt want it and why isn‚Äôt any of this making sense? Why am I here? Why did he do that? Why isn‚Äôt he talking to me? He knows what I want, but he won‚Äôt tell me his own thoughts. I need this to mean something. He knows that. Why won‚Äôt he talk to me?

I barely sleep.

‚Ä¶

	I hardly sleep the entire weekend, but he asks me to hang out again. I have a plan this time. We‚Äôre going to talk. I‚Äôm not going home until I know what‚Äôs going on. I need answers.

	We‚Äôve talked about this before. I said that I want it to mean something. I haven‚Äôt had my first kiss. I want it to be with someone I love, and someone who cares for me the same way. It‚Äôs why it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. I can be affectionate when I want to be. Our nights together prove that. This is different to me, though. He knows that, which is why I need to know.

	We go out for coffee. That‚Äôs supposed to be the end of it. We take a turn and he asks if I want food. I say yes, but I know I‚Äôm not going to be able to eat any of it. I‚Äôve never been able to eat more than a few bites of anything with him. It‚Äôs the nerves. We get dinner. That‚Äôs supposed to be the end of it. We go back to his place, and I put mine in the fridge. We fall into our normal routine. We turn on the TV and cuddle on the couch. I play with his hair. He dozes off for a bit. I‚Äôm not able to talk about it when we‚Äôre here. I need to be outside, not stuck here and away from home.

	I forget.

	My head empties and my thoughts clear. My heart still races, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs him.

	We go to his room after he wakes up. We lay down and talk for a while. We hear the front door open and close. His roommate must be home. He gets up and closes his bedroom door, and I close my eyes as I wait for him to return.

	I feel him over me first. The bed dips on either side of my body. I open my eyes. He gives me The Look and I watch him lean down. I can‚Äôt move this time. He kisses me. Just a peck.

	‚ÄúI stole it.‚Äù

	He smiles.

	I say he did, and I laugh and look away. He lays back down next to me and we talk about anything but that.

	I forget. My head is empty. My thoughts are clear.

	We joke about the lizard people and talk about his favorite movie franchise. Things are light and easy and they way they should be. He wraps his arms around me again, and I tuck my head under his chin. We lay like this for a while before it gets too warm and I have to move again. I pull back, and he‚Äôs there. He kisses me. Just a peck. I laugh and look away. We move on.

	I forget. My head is empty. My thoughts are clear.

	We stay for a while. Things are easy. It‚Äôs normal. It‚Äôs getting too late, but neither of us want to move, so we stay. I tell him about my favorite artist and the song they recently came out with. I go on and on about my favorite media. There have been teasers online, but until anything officially comes out, I just get to enjoy what‚Äôs already there. We talk about everything and nothing, just as we always do.

	We sit up once it really gets too late, but he‚Äôs the only one that moves. He sits in front of me rather than next to me, but my gaze remains fixed on the bed.

	‚ÄúYou can look up. Don‚Äôt look so sad.‚Äù	I‚Äôm not sad. I tell him that I just don‚Äôt like making eye contact, but I look up anyway. His fingers are under my chin, and he kisses me again. He tries to push it deeper, but I pull back and smile and laugh and say we should probably go. We both work, and we both need sleep. I need to go home. All of my things are there. He agrees, but we don‚Äôt move for a while. Time doesn‚Äôt move normally anymore.

	My thoughts are sluggish and my emotions are muddled. There‚Äôs nothing to make sense of. My mind lingers.

	This is what I wanted, isn‚Äôt it?

	I don‚Äôt speak again until we‚Äôre in front of my apartment. I ask what I‚Äôve been wanting to ask for the last four days. I know where I‚Äôm at, but he hasn‚Äôt been clear. He‚Äôs been contradictory. I want things to go a certain way, but I‚Äôve already accepted that I can‚Äôt have that, so he needs to tell me what he wants.

	‚ÄúMy feelings are mixed.‚Äù

1j7sevm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1j7sevm/the_sombergrimm_are_always_watching/,The Sombergrimm are always watching...,"I don't have much time. By the time anyone reads this, the post will be flagged and deleted. Hell, I might be deleted too. ""Missing"" is what they'll call it. Just another conspiracy theorist who disappeared. But I have to warn you about what I found at CERN (if you don't know what CERN is, look it up ‚Äî I don't have time to explain here) while working on one of their black box programs.

Three months ago, I was just another grad student assisting senior researchers. They brought me in because of my dissertation on quantum field disruptions. I thought it was the opportunity of a lifetime. I was right, just not in the way I hoped.

This particular black box program wasn't studying particle physics. We were studying¬†*them*. The Sombergrimm. Multidimensional entities that exist within the fabric of our perceived reality. They've always been here, feeding off human fear, growing stronger with each technological advancement we make.

The worst part? We invited them in. Those home security cameras ‚Äî Google Nest, Ring, Arlo ‚Äî our laptop webcams ‚Äî our fucking phones ‚Äî they're not just monitoring for burglars, conducting zooms, or uploading your damn cat to Tik Tok. They're portals. The Sombergrimm use them to watch us, study us, harvest our fear.

I've witnessed the aftermath of their complete materialization. Atmospheric pressure plummets without warning. Even electromagnetic waves go to shit. Surveillance recordings warp. Dark silhouettes shift in ways that defy natural principles. People living where they reside suffer overwhelming anxiety, persistent suspicion, self-destructive urges. Their joy vanishes, leaving behind a vacant void that counseling can't reach.

Remember those childhood games? Saying Freddy Krueger in the bathroom mirror?

It's like that, but real.

The Sombergrimm can be summoned by saying their name three times in front of any one of your cameras -- security, laptop, phone, etc. Three utterances of ""Sombergrimm"" and they'll materialize in your home.

For God's sake, don't try it.

This isn't a creepypasta. This is a warning from someone who's seen the classified footage, who's worked with the researchers now committed to psychiatric facilities. Who's watched the shadows crawl across monitors and felt that unnatural hell that follows. This is coming from someone who has lost a friend.

I shouldn't be writing this. Every sentence I finish feels like another nail in my coffin. But I need to share what happened to Daniel.

We worked together at CERN‚Äîbrilliant physicist, skeptical to a fault. When rumors about the Sombergrimm spread through whispered conversations in the cafeteria, Daniel laughed it off as superstition. ""Multidimensional beings that feed on fear? Come on, Mauricio, we're scientists.""

Last Tuesday, he called me at 3 AM.

""I did it."" His voice trembled. ""I said the name three times in front of my new security camera. Just to prove everyone wrong.""

""You fucking idiot,"" I hissed. ""Get out of your apartment now.""

""Don't be dramatic. Nothing happened except‚Äî"" He paused. ""The lights flickered a bit. Probably coincidence. I guess the oven clock reset itself too, but that happens occasionally, right?""

I drove to his place the next day. Daniel looked terrible‚Äîeyes bloodshot, involuntary shakes as he made coffee. He admitted he hadn't slept.

""Something keeps moving at the edge of my vision,"" he whispered. ""And there's this... pressure in the room. Like the air got heavier.""

I tried to calm him, but I too was already on edge. I knew what he did. I understood the consequences.

""The oven clock still won't work properly. It's extremely slow,"" he added. ""And I keep getting 'motion detected' alerts from my Ring camera.""

I said a silent prayer for him when his back was turned. I knew he was already a goner. If there is a God, perhaps he'll feel inclined to intervene. Or, what seems to be the case, Sombergrimms don't answer to any Gods. CERN scientists have tried on multiple occasions to enact holy scripture against them. Nothing has worked yet in that regard.

Daniels cat refused to enter the living room where the camera was mounted. It hissed at empty corners, fur standing on end.

By the third day, Daniel was unraveling. Called me crying about scratching sounds in the walls. I agreed to document the phenomena, bringing my own monitoring equipment.

Big mistake.

The moment I entered his apartment, something felt more wrong. A cold and then warmth that went beyond temperature‚Äîit seeped into my bones. We set up thermal cameras, EMF detectors, the works.

That night was hell. The footage showed temperature drops of fifteen degrees in seconds. The EMF detector went haywire near the security camera. Daniel's cat pissed on the couch, then on the kitchen counter, spraying everywhere like it was terrified and trying to mark its territory.

Around 2 AM, I felt it‚Äîfingers trailing across the back of my neck when no one was there. Daniel screamed from the bathroom that something was watching him from the shower drain.

By 3 AM, I had a pounding migraine, nosebleed, and vomiting fits. Daniel looked worse‚Äîhis skin gray, eyes sunken. His apartment reeked of animal waste; his cat had diarrhea across the hallway and was hiding under the bed, growling at nothing.

I woke around 4:33 AM to Daniel standing in the living room, stripped down to his boxers, body covered in scribbled symbols drawn in black marker. The security camera's red light blinked in the corner. His eyes were wild, unfocused.

""I'm ending this,"" he muttered, arranging candles in a circle. ""I've researched countermeasures‚Äîancient rituals mixed with quantum theory.""

I scrambled up from the couch. ""Daniel, stop. You'll make it worse‚Äî""

""It feeds on fear, right? So I'll show it I'm not afraid!"" He laughed with a sinister sound that wasn't his own. ""I understand now. It's just a quantum interference pattern. We can disrupt it.""

He began a rambling incantation‚ÄîLatin phrases mixed with physics equations.

""Daniel, please‚Äî""

The security camera sparked. All lights went out. In the darkness, I heard breathing that wasn't ours. Heavy. Wet. Coming from every direction.

Daniel screamed‚Äînot in fear but in challenge. ""Show yourself! I'm not afraid of you!""

Something moved across the ceiling. A shadow darker than darkness. The candles flickered violently, casting grotesque, elongated silhouettes against the walls.

It was as though I was remote viewing this entire hellscape. The darkness that ensued made me feel like I was floating in empty space -- only witnessing Daniel directly as the victim. I felt this may be how the Sombergrimm perceives our world. Was I getting an inside look? I don't know and I don't care to experiment with again. This out of body experience didn't last long as I saw...

Daniel's body suddenly go rigid. He rose six inches off the floor, suspended by nothing. His mouth opened impossibly wide‚Äîjaw dislocating‚Äîand emitted a sound no human throat should make.

I snapped back to being in my own body. My weight heavy on feet and frozen in place.

When Daniel crashed to the floor, he began clawing at his own face, screaming about things crawling under his skin.

The police arrived thirty minutes later, responding to neighbors' complaints. They found Daniel convulsing, foaming at the mouth, eyes rolled back. Me, they discovered huddled in the bathtub, bleeding from both ears.

The official report stated acute psychosis. Drug-induced hysteria. They committed Daniel to the psychiatric ward that morning.

I visited yesterday. He doesn't speak anymore. Just stares at the ceiling, occasionally whispering ""Sombergrimm"" before the orderlies sedate him again.

I understand now what we uncovered at CERN. These entities have always existed alongside us, hiding in technological shadows. By revealing their presence, I've made myself their target too.

My own security cameras are disconnected now, and I've stopped doomscrolling but it seems to have made no difference. Last night, my phone camera activated by itself. Three times. Each time capturing nothing but my terrified face.

My last thought is that possibly these technocrats, the Bezos', the Zuckerbergs', the Cooks', the Sam Altmans' -- maybe they've made a pact with the Sombergrimm -- sacrificing us all for their own salvation. Those leaders in the technological forefronts have to know of the Sombergrimms. Perhaps we're nothing but food as a select, elite few try to buy time for themselves.

Don't call the Sombergrimm into your cameras. They are always watching. We don't have an answer on how to stop them.

By the time anyone reads this, the post will be flagged and deleted. Hell, I might be deleted too. ""Missing"" is what they'll call it. Just another conspiracy theorist who disappeared. But I have to warn you about what I found at CERN (if you don't know what CERN is, look it up ‚Äî I don't have time to explain here) while working on one of their black box programs.

Three months ago, I was just another grad student assisting senior researchers. They brought me in because of my dissertation on quantum field disruptions. I thought it was the opportunity of a lifetime. I was right, just not in the way I hoped.

This particular black box program wasn't studying particle physics. We were studying *them*. The Sombergrimm. Multidimensional entities that exist within the fabric of our perceived reality. They've always been here, feeding off human fear, growing stronger with each technological advancement we make.

The worst part? We invited them in. Those home security cameras ‚Äî Google Nest, Ring, Arlo ‚Äî our laptop webcams ‚Äî our fucking phones ‚Äî they're not just monitoring for burglars, conducting zooms, or uploading your damn cat to Tik Tok. They're portals. The Sombergrimm use them to watch us, study us, harvest our fear.

I've witnessed the aftermath of their complete materialization. Atmospheric pressure plummets without warning. Even electromagnetic waves go to shit. Surveillance recordings warp. Dark silhouettes shift in ways that defy natural principles. People living where they reside suffer overwhelming anxiety, persistent suspicion, self-destructive urges. Their joy vanishes, leaving behind a vacant void that counseling can't reach.

Remember those childhood games? Saying Freddy Krueger in the bathroom mirror?

It's like that, but real. 

The Sombergrimm can be summoned by saying their name three times in front of any one of your cameras -- security, laptop, phone, etc. Three utterances of ""Sombergrimm"" and they'll materialize in your home.

For God's sake, don't try it. 

This isn't a creepypasta. This is a warning from someone who's seen the classified footage, who's worked with the researchers now committed to psychiatric facilities. Who's watched the shadows crawl across monitors and felt that unnatural hell that follows. This is coming from someone who has lost a friend.

I shouldn't be writing this. Every sentence I finish feels like another nail in my coffin. But I need to share what happened to Daniel.

We worked together at CERN‚Äîbrilliant physicist, skeptical to a fault. When rumors about the Sombergrimm spread through whispered conversations in the cafeteria, Daniel laughed it off as superstition. ""Multidimensional beings that feed on fear? Come on, Mauricio, we're scientists.""

Last Tuesday, he called me at 3 AM.

""I did it."" His voice trembled. ""I said the name three times in front of my new security camera. Just to prove everyone wrong.""

""You fucking idiot,"" I hissed. ""Get out of your apartment now.""

""Don't be dramatic. Nothing happened except‚Äî"" He paused. ""The lights flickered a bit. Probably coincidence. I guess the oven clock reset itself too, but that happens occasionally, right?""

I drove to his place the next day. Daniel looked terrible‚Äîeyes bloodshot, involuntary shakes as he made coffee. He admitted he hadn't slept.

""Something keeps moving at the edge of my vision,"" he whispered. ""And there's this... pressure in the room. Like the air got heavier.""

I tried to calm him, but I too was already on edge. I knew what he did. I understood the consequences.

""The oven clock still won't work properly. It's extremely slow,"" he added. ""And I keep getting 'motion detected' alerts from my Ring camera.""

I said a silent prayer for him when his back was turned. I knew he was already a goner. If there is a God, perhaps he'll feel inclined to intervene. Or, what seems to be the case, Sombergrimms don't answer to any Gods. CERN scientists have tried on multiple occasions to enact holy scripture against them. Nothing has worked yet in that regard.

Daniels cat refused to enter the living room where the camera was mounted. It hissed at empty corners, fur standing on end.

By the third day, Daniel was unraveling. Called me crying about scratching sounds in the walls. I agreed to document the phenomena, bringing my own monitoring equipment.

Big mistake.

The moment I entered his apartment, something felt more wrong. A cold and then warmth that went beyond temperature‚Äîit seeped into my bones. We set up thermal cameras, EMF detectors, the works.

That night was hell. The footage showed temperature drops of fifteen degrees in seconds. The EMF detector went haywire near the security camera. Daniel's cat pissed on the couch, then on the kitchen counter, spraying everywhere like it was terrified and trying to mark its territory.

Around 2 AM, I felt it‚Äîfingers trailing across the back of my neck when no one was there. Daniel screamed from the bathroom that something was watching him from the shower drain.

By 3 AM, I had a pounding migraine, nosebleed, and vomiting fits. Daniel looked worse‚Äîhis skin gray, eyes sunken. His apartment reeked of animal waste; his cat had diarrhea across the hallway and was hiding under the bed, growling at nothing.

My friend & I both have birthdays in May. We're going to have a little bit of an itinerary and I know we are doing Red Rocks, Meow Wolf, Garden of the Gods. She has never been. 

I have a list of restaurants we've sorted out via this fabulous area of reddit & some sleuthing. 

  
Here's what I'm seeking some information:

Are these still great places to go, and if not - where would you suggest? (I have a list of 45 places FWIW on our google maps):

Is La Loma 

Is Corrine

Alma Fonda Fina

Any word on Alteno when it opens? Do you have any place that you'd go for a real special occasion?

  
Since coffee matters to me:

What are your best coffee places?

I was looking at handcraft espresso & little owl tremont



If you really wanted to show someone from out of town a real Denver gem where would you take them?

I know the argument of who has the best tacos is subjective and no shortage of amazing Mexican food. Know that I will be seeking green chili for my bday wishes.

Here are my top 5 and bottom 5 Trader Joe‚Äôs items in no particular order. Heads up, this my personal opinion and no one has a final say <3

Top

- Agua De Keifer (beverage): I‚Äôve had one every day since I started working with the company. Really changed my mind about kombucha based drinks. Not sure if it‚Äôs a west coast thing. 

- Korean BBQ Bulgolgi (Frozen): I love making this for my parents when we want a restaurant quality meal without paying $40 a head.

- Dutch pancakes (Frozen): always grab these for weekend breakfast. Great for hacking the McGriddle at home. Only negative about these is the size, wish they were bigger. 

- Limeade (beverage): The BEST grocery store limeade. Love to use it for a quick Margarita or Moscow mule. 

- Hold The Cone! Coffee Bean (Frozen): I ate the whole box the first time, nuff said.

Bottom 5 

- Beef and Broccoli (Frozen): sauce is too sweet, little beef, and at $7.99, it needs some help. 

- Pho (discontinued?): broth tasted like water and the beef was hard to chew. 

- Freeze Dried Watermelon (nuts and dried fruit): Forbidden Dorito. Weirdly dissolves instantly in my mouth and tastes rotten. Watermelon imo should be left alone for freeze drying.  

- Pizza Party Chips (snacks): the tomato powder in the seasoning blend is too strong. I think these would work better as crackers. 

- Fudge dipped cookies (cookies and candy): have a waxy texture like an entemens donut. Mushy and bland. 


That was my list. What are your top and bottom 5s. I‚Äôd love to know so I can get some recs and avoiders. Thanks and have a good night!

This is an odd one for me. I‚Äôve just been to my Dentist (within the last week).

I‚Äôve been going to this practice for the better part of 3 odd years now because my previous one closed down, and this one is down the street from me making it nice and easy to get to.

Up until now I‚Äôve never had a problem. I booked on a Wednesday which is a day that is outside of my usual, which is a Saturday.

The way this practice works is that you have a dental hygienist who does the usual cleaning etc, then the dentist themselves who comes in and does any final checks. I‚Äôve found this odd considering at my last practice this wasn‚Äôt the norm ‚Ä¶ but no issue here.

The issue is, on this particular day, an older gentlemen who isn‚Äôt my regular dentist came in, didn‚Äôt really introduce himself -> had a look at my teeth and the first thing to come out of his mouth is ‚Äúhave you considered veneers‚Äù?!

I‚Äôve looked at him bewildered and confused. I asked him if there was anything wrong with my teeth and he couldn‚Äôt really come up with anything.

As far as my teeth go, they‚Äôre not perfect - a little discoloured from all the coffee I drink, a little worn down because I grind my teeth due to stress and anxiety and I keep forgetting to wear my night guard regularly. 

But outwardly they‚Äôre fine, maybe a little gappy?
Why on earth is his first thought veneers?

Is this just him trying to push cosmetic surgery that I don‚Äôt need because he hopes I‚Äôm insecure about my teeth and he‚Äôs hoping to cash in over it?

1j7s8to,https://i.redd.it/necgo8ar1tne1.jpeg,French avenue Spicy amber,"Notes my amateur nose detects from this perfume:  incense, coffee, vanilla.

The incense here smells like burning the Omani Loban/ frankincense.

This fragrance smells like having a cappuccino and burning frankincense together.

This is supposed to be a dupe of matiere premiere encens suave. I never smelled the original.

It lasts for 6-7hrs on clothes. It‚Äôs still detectable on clothes if you smell it closer to clothes. Tested only in cold weather (14-24degrees c) and mostly wearable in cold weather I guess. Don‚Äôt buy this if you want a lasting and projection beast. This at tops projects 2 feet and more like a comforting scent.

Bought this for 2400/- ( 100qar).

I love incense smelling perfumes that‚Äôs the reason I bought this and I love it. 

I also smelled French avenue mystic rose and it smelled like jam made out of rose and added sugar and pepper. I didn‚Äôt buy it but my friend bought it. After buying this we both went and smelled frederic malle portrait of a lady and both of them smelled same almost 80% on paper strip.

I also tried fragrance world ebony fume. I liked it but I don‚Äôt remember the notes but it smelled like a Catholic Church. Next time when I go shopping I will try it again and may buy it. Costs around 1500/- (70qar).

I'm hoping there's someone out there in a similar situation as me.

I'm 6'1"", 265 lbs, and just hit the age of 32. While that might sound big, I come from an athletic background (rugby, lifting, soccer), so I tend to move faster than most people my size.

I've been training BJJ for about 2.5 years and earned my blue belt back in June. For most people, that would be an exciting moment, but for me, it was honestly a bit disappointing. I had plans to compete in some big tournaments as a white belt but only managed to do two small regional ones before getting promoted.

Since then, it's been tough. The week after I got my blue belt, my life just seemed to fall apart and it feels like I've barely trained since:

- A week after my promotion, I found out I barely failed my CFE exam (decile ranking 1, which stung).

- Not long after, a coffee mug dropped on my hand when I opened the cupboard at work, needed stitches, and was out for 3 weeks.

- Two weeks later, during my vacation, my house caught fire. Thankfully it was contained to one room, but we couldn‚Äôt live there until repairs were done (insurance nightmare).

- A week after getting back, I returned to BJJ, and a white belt fractured my elbow because he didn‚Äôt feel my tap. He apologized, but I was out for another 5 weeks.

- As I was starting to feel better, I agreed to house-sit for a friend. Their doorknobs were made of glass, and ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî I cut my right hand pretty bad. More stitches. The worst part was the freezing needle they had to inject at the top of my thumb (never again).

- Finally healed up, only to catch ring-worm two weeks later. Out again.


In the middle of all this, I was also dealing with house repairs (went through two contractors) and studying for my CFE rewrite. Honestly, it‚Äôs been a rough stretch.

Now I'm at a point where I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve my blue belt. After so much time off and so many setbacks, I feel like my skillset is still at a white belt level. I‚Äôve forgotten a ton of stuff, my timing feels off, and it‚Äôs hard to justify the belt around my waist.

Has anyone ever asked to be demoted before so they could re-earn their belt? I‚Äôm seriously considering it because I want to feel like I actually earned it, and right now‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt.

I recognize it's been doing great since the new CEO stepped in but what's there to like about this stock? Layoffs will help the bottomline but there does not seem to be any upside.

Egal ob diese im Real Life oder Online stattfinden. Ich komme aus NRW N√§he Bielefeld. Ich habe zwei Katzen. 
Zu meinen Interessen, wobei ich hier nur meine Liebsten Dinge aufz√§hle, denn sonst w√ºrde es den Rahmen sprengen. :D

Anime: Cyberpunk Edgrunners, Death Note, Naruto, Angels of Death, fast alles vom Studio Ghibli
Filme: Harry Potter, Mad Max Fury Road, Furiosa
Serien: Taboo
B√ºcher: Harry Potter, Die Mitternachtsbibliothek, Frau Komachi empfielt ein Buch
Games: Cyberpunk 2077, Baldurs Gate 3, Elder Scrolls, Witcher 3, Coffee Talk, Resident Evil, Sims, Animal Crossing, Pokemon
Twitch: Gronkh, Die Doni, H0llyLP
Youtube: Kupferfuchs, JanaKlar, Lisa with Love, Naomi Jon, Malwanne

Ansonsten interessiere ich mich f√ºr Nachhaltigkeit, Minimalismus und Spiritualit√§t z.B. Tarot und Wicca.
(Bei keinem dieser Themen gebe ich mich als ""Bekehrer"". Ich akzeptiere und respektiere jeden Lifestyle. Ich selbst lebe diese auch NICHT exzessiv aus, sondern besch√§ftige mich lediglich mit diesen Themen und schaue ob ich Punkte davon in mein Leben integrieren kann.)

Ich besitze keinerlei Social Media wie Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp oder TikTok. (Nur auf Reddit vertreten, und hier auch erst ganz frisch dabei!) und ebenso nutze ich keine Streaming Dienste. Ich lebe hinter dem Mond, ich wei√ü. Aber ich habe √ºber die Jahre festgestellt, dass ich pers√∂nlich ohne diese Dinge besser durch's Leben komme. Ich habe bereits versucht auf Apps wie Boo oder Hoop neue Kontakt zu kn√ºpfen, aber dies blieb eher erfolglos bzw. verlief sich schnell wieder im Sand.

Ich verbringe gerne Zeit in der Natur, wenn das Wetter es zul√§sst. Spazieren top! 
Ich gehe ebenfalls gerne Essen, denn Kochen z√§hlt nicht zu meinen St√§rken.
Ansonsten ist ins Kino gehen oder Gesellschaftsspiele spielen auch guter Zeitvertreib. Sonst mag ich noch Tattoos und Piercings.
Ich bin jemand der es cozy mag. Ich bin schon eher introvertiert, au√üer der Vibe stimmt auf anhieb, dann overshare ich schon fast. :D 

Wenn ich auf euch -trotz meines Lebens hinter dem Mond- sympathisch wirke, w√ºrde ich mich sehr √ºber eine Nachricht von euch freuen!
