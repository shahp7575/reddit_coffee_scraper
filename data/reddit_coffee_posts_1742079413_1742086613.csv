Trying one more time‚Ä¶ 

My husband and I have been open for a while, and spent years preparing for that. Open, not poly. Friends with benefits was our model. He decided a couple months ago to explore with a coworker he‚Äôs known for many years. Boundaries were pushed day 1 and it‚Äôs been a roller coaster. Long story short, they wanted a relationship, not a FWB arrangement. I agreed to try this with them if they agreed to go slooooow because we took YEARS to prepare to open and poly is a whole new ballgame. The agreement between the three of us was if anyone became uncomfortable, we‚Äôd call it off and they would de-escalate back to friends. 

Two weeks in (two happy hour dates, one coffee date, and one make out) I realized I really truly wasn‚Äôt ready. I needed a lot more time to prepare for polyamory, and decide whether it was actually for me. I was having very strong responses to the typical jealousy/insecurity moments and I‚Äôm now really working on that in therapy. In asking to close, my husband changed his mind and said he wasn‚Äôt willing to. He said he‚Äôd realized he‚Äôd been resenting me without realizing it for our 15 year marriage because my childhood trauma wounds dictate our relationship and he has just been steamrolled or deferred to me for everything. He decided this relationship was the first thing he wanted to assert himself on continuing. 

I was baffled, because I was operating under the agreement we made, and because the discovery of him feeling steamrolled for so long really caught me off guard. We started marriage therapy because he feels extremely strongly that he has no agency or autonomy in our relationship. I‚Äôm working hard to change this for us. 

In the past six weeks, he told me the following: he is no longer willing to be transparent about his relationship with me, all agreements and boundaries we had before are null, he will escalate as feels good to him, etc. They‚Äôve continued to see each other several times a week and are now sleeping together. He has told me he is not willing to talk agreements or boundaries whatsoever with me until I‚Äôve ‚Äúfully let it go and set it aside‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve struggled with this, although I believe I‚Äôve done it. I‚Äôve accepted the relationship and have stopped asking him to change it in any way, have any say, etc. I haven‚Äôt asked to talk boundaries or agreements. But, I‚Äôve cried a lot and it‚Äôs been hard, hard work. I upped my therapy, my meds, starting working really hard on crisis survival and distress tolerance skills, and began exploring my trauma responses to feeling de-prioritized. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve also lost 15 lbs in a month and started struggling at work. Basically, fell into a deep depressive episode. I‚Äôve now started a 3-5 week partial hospitalization mental health treatment program and am on a leave of absence from work on the recommendation of my therapist. 

I‚Äôm staying apart from my family (husband and three children) during the week while I‚Äôm in this program, because it‚Äôs so hard to be around my husband while I know he‚Äôs texting her, going to see her twice a week, etc. 

He doesn‚Äôt have a time frame for when he thinks he‚Äôll be ready to talk agreements and boundaries again. He says I need to trust that he will at some point ‚Äúturn back towards me‚Äù and feel empathy and want to work together again. The ambiguity and uncertainty is quite hard for me. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? And how long did it take for your partner to feel ready to re-engage? I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre simply heading for divorce because I don‚Äôt know how long I can stay in this limbo. I absolutely don‚Äôt want to divorce but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm 100% against poly. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready right now and would prefer we close our marriage or keep our old structure or even keep where they were before (not escalating to more serious) while we figure this out. He is unwilling to do that, so I‚Äôm trying to do what he needs to at least get to talk boundaries and agreements‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm just not sure how much longer I can hold on.

Location: US (Moved from Asia a year ago)

Any existing relevant medical issues: None

Current medications: None


I've noticed a strange pattern of heartburn and acid reflex in my partner (28F)

Whenever we go out for lunch/brunch, my partner almost always ends up experiencing discomfort - burning sensation, loud burps, the usual acid reflux symptoms. However, if we eat similar foods for dinner or even late at night, it is completely fine. We always have a gap of 3-4 hrs before dinner and sleep so it's not like sleep makes the acid reflux go away.

This happens regardless of the cuisine - pancakes, sandwiches, burgers, italian, indian, mexican, thai, etc. We are vegetarian so I get that a ratio of protein to carbs and fat is a bit skewed. But its not like we have spicy food.


- No known food allergies or intolerances.

- Portion sizes for lunch and dinner are about the same.

- Alcohol or caffeine is generally never a part of the meals.

- Caffeine intake in a morning is minimal (one cup tea or quarter cup of coffee)

- Plenty of water intake

- Decent workout routine (5 days a week)

- No lying down right after eating lunch.


Could it be related to digestion patterns, circadian rhythms, stomach acid production, or something else? Has anyone else experienced this? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, especially on how to fix this!

This was never a problem for my partner when she lived in Asia. This started like 6months after moving to the US.

Dear A.

I just hope writing this will take away some of the limerence away.

From the moment I stepped into that resturant for an interview and saw you, you have enraptured my mind. For over 2 years, a constant slow build of attraction and longing.

But, you probably never think of me that way, and I know that. You've probably never thought of me at all outside of annoyingly neurotic coworker, who is hot & cold with you.
You've probably not laid awake dreaming of me, as I have you.

I delude myself, replaying moments our eyes meet from across the workplace, sometimes I think your eyes linger on me for just that bit longer than you normally should, I swear I can feel your eyes watching me everywhere.
The day you were on the phone in the dining area, we made eye contact and I could've sworn your eyes and body language gave off more than absent-mindedly resting your eyes somewhere for a moment.
But I know, I am nothing more than a co-worker to you.
I have started stealing as many glances as I can, enjoying any small bit of perceiving you that I can get, because once work finishes, I don't get to see you.
The small touches of our hands whenever we work together in close proximity, it drives me almost insane. I look at your hands and wonder what they would feel like in mine. 
Sometimes I purposely avoid touching you at all due to the absolute thrill I get from even a brush of fingers while  handing over a coffee cup.

Your laughter sparks a need inside me to hear it more. Your smile literally the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, the way you stand even gives me chills.  
Even your mere presence when arriving or departing awakens an alertness on my mind, body and soul.
I constantly wish for you to be near me

Sometimes my delusions start to make fantasy, I don't even know you at all, but my entire being wishes too.
My mind tries to engineer ways to run into you outside of work, ways to get your attention or have even a friendship so that hopefully the limerence would dissipate into something less intense. Maybe if I saw you more often outside of work, my mind would see through the fantasy delusions I have created of you. 

I do have an overwhelming jealousy and anger that She gets to know you in the ways I wish I could.
I know, personally, professionally, and in reality, we could never be together. Sometimes I honestly wish, it was me and not her. That I had gotten there first, and, sometime I wonder if you feel the same about my relationship.

My relationship... I almost hate you some days, purely because I am happy, and have an amazing life, an amazing partner but you have some sort of magnetic attraction that I've never felt before, it draws me into you.
I don't even know who you are, you are a coworker, a stranger even, you could be a horrible person! You are a horrible person! I know you are, because you've already cheated on your gf multiple times. What kind of sick human being does that make me? To have a limerence for somebody like that, but I do... And it's getting worse.

Everyday, I watch for your car to pull into the parking lot, I study everything you do so closely, as soon as I smell your cologne, I can't think of anything else, it makes me  dizzy with lust? Desire? Need. You walk past me and i can feel myself lean towards you, as if all I need is a small brush of your arm against mine to quell the fire you've sparked, but even that wouldn't be enough now. Whenever you aren't at work, I feel lighter, maybe because I'm not constantly on high alert. But I've started to dream of you, and now I can barely speak to you without imagining what my brain fantasized about. Some very NSFW content. In other words:


You consume me.


I know our lives as we know them, do not allow for such a thing to happen between us. 
But just know, that in another life... I hope to find you.

I once again, hope that you never find this. And if you do, I prayed you have a hard time figuring out who I am.

I know that she also had Saturday off of work. We both didn‚Äôt start to wake up until around noon today. This is 4 1/2 hours ago. I asked her if there was anything she wanted to do today. She said she just wants to take a shower, but doesn‚Äôt want to do it in a dirty bathroom. She rarely has these days where she‚Äôs unstable and freaks out about anything. The fact that she didn‚Äôt even give me a real answer and just said that she wants to shower was my first hint. So having picked up on it, I went ahead and just started getting ready to clean. Once she heard that I was going to clean the bathroom, she even said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting all charged up‚Äù. At first, it was taking me a while to get started and she was confused. I told her I was getting the cleaning equipment that she ordered ready and getting myself some coffee because I wasn‚Äôt expecting to do this first thing. She commented that I should also  clean the coffee machine and I told her I already did that and that is another reason why I was taking longer to start on the bathroom. I went and cleaned the shower and bathtub even taking the time to remove all of our stuff and the curtain and replacing them back to their original positions. I noted to myself that she didn‚Äôt move the curtain and it was damaged by the chemicals so I made sure to do that this time. I admit the bathroom wasn‚Äôt cleaned as much as I would like, but the new device wasn‚Äôt retaining charge as I expected. I finished up by hand and told her when I was done so that she can take her shower as she wanted. I zoned off on the couch, not even thinking because I‚Äôm just waiting for her come out of the shower so that we can spend some time together. Otherwise I‚Äôm completely out of it. I‚Äôm only looking forward to some time with her. She approaches me later, without even taking a shower and is upset that I didn‚Äôt clean the whole bathroom. I told her I was going to clean the whole bathroom, but knowing that she wanted to take a shower, I prioritized that. She was so upset that she became belligerent and started throwing and breaking things all over the place. When I tried to stop her from breaking my things in the bathroom, she just went ahead and did it anyway and there was nothing I can do to really calm her down. She‚Äôs not one to apologize, but I went and got her some strawberries to show I‚Äôm thinking of her. While I know I‚Äôm NTA.

For the past couple years my sleep has gotten worse, but lately over the last few months I feel like I am on the verge of a full mental breakdown because of lack of sleep. 

For context I am 33F, I am healthy workout 4xlifting and walk daily, I get up and see the sun and go for a long walk just after sunrise(to try to help circadian rhythm if this is the issue) I use Whole Foods, I don't drink, smoke, and I gave up coffee last month. 

  
I fall asleep usually around 8:30/9pm, but every night like clockwork, I wake up and I am WIDE AWAKE. I will usually go pee because it's as if my brain knows I kinda have to pee and usually peeing helps me go back to sleep. I will often get up multiple times to pee. When I wake, I sometimes it feels like my heart is even racing. I try not to look at my phone or clock to avoid blue light etc but last night I ended up getting up after laying there for about an hour and I checked and it was 1:30am. I tried to go back to sleep and I managed to doze off but I woke up 4/5 more times before it was time to wakeup at 6. 

It feels like I never get a deep sleep, my eyes often hurt when I wake up in the morning. 

Here are supplements I take:  
Thorne Tyrosine\* (activated b complex, ashwaghanda, copper, iron, etc)  
DIM supplement to release excess estrogen, Magnesium Glysinate 

I'm seriously desperate to sleep. I feel like this may be anxiety related, and I try to take deep breaths and calm myself down but I am WIDE awake for hours and its so frustrating, its as if my body thinks its morning after just a few hours of sleep? And I thought it might be circadian rhythm related but I try to see both the sunrise and sunset and get as much sun as possible!

A lot of people in this sub **want more than just survival**‚Äîwe want to actually **enjoy life**, even if we don‚Äôt have the financial freedom we dream of yet.

Here‚Äôs the truth: **You don‚Äôt have to be rich to afford nice things.** You just have to be **smarter than the system that wants you to overpay.**

I‚Äôve spent a long time **finding ways to live well on a limited budget**, and I‚Äôve created a community that helps people **get the best deals on the things they actually need**‚Äîwithout spam, gimmicks, or overwhelming garbage.

# üî• How to Save Money & Still Get What You Want

Instead of just telling you to **‚Äústop buying coffee‚Äù** or **‚Äúcut Netflix‚Äù**, here‚Äôs a better approach:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Buy Smarter, Not Cheaper

Instead of **always looking for the cheapest option**, focus on getting **the best value for your money**. Sometimes, **paying a little more upfront saves you money long-term** because you don‚Äôt have to replace things as often.

üí° **Example:** Instead of buying the **cheapest non-stick pan that scratches in a month**, look for **a highly rated one on sale that lasts for years.**

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Discounts & Deals to Your Advantage

Big retailers like Amazon **quietly change prices all the time**‚Äîsometimes by **hundreds of dollars overnight.** The problem? **Most people never notice.**

This is where **my Discord comes in.** I **personally track daily price drops** and post **only the best deals‚Äîno spam, no gimmicks.**

üí° **Example:** A monitor that was **$299 dropped to $189 for only a few hours** before jumping back up. If you weren‚Äôt watching, you‚Äôd never know.

**Instead of wasting hours hunting deals, just let me do it for you.** If there‚Äôs something you want, **tell me in my server, and I‚Äôll find the best price for you.**

# üöÄ Why I Created My Discord & How It Can Help

Most deal sites are **overloaded with junk**‚Äîthey post **thousands of deals per day**, and you have to **dig through garbage just to find something useful.**

üí∞ **I do things differently.**

* **I personally post the best deals I find each day‚Äîno spam.**
* **If you‚Äôre looking for a specific item, tell me and I‚Äôll find the best price for you.**
* **I also post every time a game goes free on Steam, so you don‚Äôt miss out.**

**My goal is to make sure people in this community stop overpaying.** If you‚Äôre tired of getting ripped off, **come check it out.**

At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right?

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

Ever felt like time blocking is less about creativity and more about feeling like a robot on auto-pilot? ü§ñ I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthose color-coded schedules can be super satisfying, but sometimes, doesn't it feel like trying to squeeze your creative juices from a stone?

**Here's the tea** üçµ: We've all been there, staring at that time slot for ""Creative Work"" and thinking... ""Eh, I got nothin'."" So, what if we *flip the script* a bit and try something totally crazy that's literally going to take just 10 seconds? Curious? Oh, I see those curious eyes already!

**Enter the 10-Second Energy Hack!** ‚ú®

Okay, here it is. Three words: **Shake. It. Out.**

1. **Stand up**: Yup, that‚Äôs right, get your butt outta that chair!
   
2. **Release energy**: Give your arms a good shake. Add your legs in there, too‚Äîchannel your inner Taylor Swift and just, you know, *shake it off* (sorry, couldn't resist).

3. **Deep breath**: Now inhale deeply... and exhale like you‚Äôre just letting go of all that brain fog. *Feel better already?* Of course you do!

I know it sounds a bit wacky, but hear me out. Sometimes your brain just needs a tiny reset‚Äîa little jolt to get those creative neurons firing again. All that pent-up energy has to go somewhere, right? Plus, let‚Äôs be real, it definitely beats another cup of coffee (or a fifth if you're keeping count ‚òï).

**Why does it work?** Well, it‚Äôs like jump-starting a stalled car. A quick jolt gets everything moving smoothly again. Plus, it‚Äôs fast, it's free, and it totally breaks those monotonous thought patterns. 

Has anyone else tried something like this when their brain's been in a funk? Maybe you‚Äôve got an even quirkier hack‚Äîor even just found solace in another ritual? Would love to know what‚Äôs been working for *you*!

1. The GPT now suggests grind sizes to go along with each brew profile for the Ode Gen2, Opus, and Ode+SSP. 
2. The GPT can now produce brew.link profiles that can be automatically added via the Fellow app and shared (shoutout to brewshare.coffee). After you've generated a profile, the GPT will ask if you want to generate a brew.link. Just respond Yes and authorize the action and you'll get a link back ready to go!

Thanks again to the community for all the feedback. Adding the brew.link functionality did require setting up some hosting, so if you get use out of it and want to contribute to hosting costs, you can contribute here: https://buymeacoffee.com/gabelevine

1jc7u5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1jc7u5l/my_depressed_father_is_addicted_to_gaming_and_its/,my depressed father is addicted to gaming and it's tearing our family apart,"I'm posting here because frankly i need a place to vent my feelings and also I really need advice on how to proceed from hereon. TLDR at the bottom. 

The background story:

My father is a very frugal person. Extremely so. He won't even buy himself a coffee or a little snack if he's outside, he is the person to think twice before even spending money. All the money my parents earn is managed by him. We were very poor when I was growing up but the last 5ish years we've been comfortable. 

My dad has battled with depression his whole life. I think it's a high functioning depression and it only showed it's ugly head thrice in my whole life when he broke down and cried about not wanting to live anymore and not having anything that brings him joy in life. He is a very dependable husband and father and after my mom's battle with cancer he turned even more accommodating towards her, practically fulfilling every one of her wishes before she even utters them.

Now to the gaming addiction: 

It started four months ago. Some kind of mobile game where he has a ""guild"" and they participate in some battles for dominance in the game. He approached me twice with some money because he wanted to use my PayPal to purchase some things and told me to keep it from mom. The total was like 200 euros. I thought ""why not? he's never spent a dime on himself, even if it's a lot of money, if it's only once, no harm done"". 

Man, how wrong I was. In the last three months he started using his own checking account. I only noticed he was purchasing things without telling me or my mom when I got a PayPal notification about purchases made that I didn't recognize. It totaled up to 1000 euros. 

I confronted him, he told me to keep quiet but we got into a huge fight and my mom noticed that something was wrong. Long story short: she found out, that night I took his iPad and viewed the purchase history and added everything up. It was nearly 10k, all of our savings gone. I know it might not seem like a lot to some people here who have lost or spent way more, but 1. that was all the fucking money we had saved and 2. coming from someone who was so fucking frugal and trustworthy all my life that was the heaviest blow imaginable and 3. as I said, we were relatively poor and it was a huge thing for us that we were able to have some savings at all.

The discussion quickly went from denial (""no i didn't spend money"", ""it was only 2k max"")  to ""i don't have one thing in my life I do for myself, I can do what I want with my money, I don't have to explain myself"" etc. 

In the end he promised us that he was not going to play anymore. I got a refund for the 1k from my PayPal account, the majority of the money is gone though. He sulked for two days, wouldn't talk to us and just slept after work. Then he told us that he was going to play but he wouldn't purchase anything anymore. My mom told him that she doesn't trust him with this game anymore and after another fight he promised that he would quit. 

Well, today (it's the sixth day after the blowout) I noticed him playing again and my mom looked at his phone and saw the text messaged to a friend where my dad asked for his PayPal because ""my daughter refunded some of my packages and now I can't buy things anymore"". 

Had another fight tonight because of this. He said he just wanted to delete his account and to do this he had to log in with a PayPal, which, please, who is he trying to fool?

I'm sick and tired of fighting. I can barely sleep at night because I have to think about this huge betrayal and how it affects us financially, how I can get him out of this gaming addiction. Talking to him doesn't work because he always either denies playing or swears on my life that he's never going to touch the game anymore. 

What the fuck do I do? My mom is a mess, all the money is gone, and the worst of all: the trust I had in my father, who in my eyes was the sweetest, most self-sacrificing, honest and intelligent man is gone. I can't see him as the same man anymore, there is only hurt, betrayal, distrust and anger left in me. How do I cope with this? It's like the dad I knew died on the day everything came to light. He won't acknowledge his gaming addiction, is not sorry about the money lost at all, is only happy while playing that fucking game. 

**TLDR; my trustworthy father who is managing all our savings blew all of it because of an iPad game and says he quit the game but I have reasonable doubt that he's just secretly gaming on his phone and he's trying to find a way to purchase things without us noticing. The infallible trust we had in him is gone and I don't know how to cope with that and what to do about his gaming addiction. Please give me some advice.**

A year ago after smoking weed for 10 years all day everyday out of the blue evey time I smoked I got weed induced panic attacks. I stop smoking weed but the panic attacks has kept happening everyday since for the past year. SSRIs don't help. The only thing that helps is Klonopin. But I don't want to take that forever. I'm also during CBT with a therapist which doesn't seem to help. I'm not clinically depressed. I get depressed sometimes thay this is happening to me everyday. So that's why I'm trying in home ketamine. 

Doctor want me to do 100 mg 2x week for a month. Next month 200 mg 2x week and next month 400mg 2x week and then start bringing the dose back down. 

Got my ketamine in mail and Thursday was my first time and I only did 25 mg. Nothing much but a little fuzzyness for a hour and was like I had a hangover the rest of the day.

Today I decided to do the rest of the troche which was 75 mg. Same fuzziness but more intense. I'm doing the eye covers and music with it. But this time I got that weed induced panic feeling when it started to kick in. It went away about 20 mins later and about another 20-30 mins i was fine and seemed like the feeling from the ketamine was subsiding so I took my headphones and eye cover off and smoked my a cigarette. Then I fixed me a coffee and drunk half of it and then the full blown panic attack set in so i took a Klonopin and had to wait it out. Feeling better now but still fuzzy in the brain. Maybe the coffee did it to me. Maybe the cigarettes?? 

My problem with taking this ketamine is going to be the feeling of being high which my brain seems to refer that feeling to me smoking weed and gives me a panic attack. I really don't know how I will do 200 or even 400 mg. The past year I've been in a cycle of panic attacks when I feel any bit weird and it all started with the weed.  So I really don't know how to proceed with this therapy knowing it will make me feel weird and I'll go into panic mode. Any advice?

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!

It's all paid for with EBT.  It looks like items you'd buy at an international market or a family-owned grocery store.  They'll come in with several carts and will buy $400-$800 or more of food items.  The items they buy are items that are commonly used for resale.  Single-serve herbal beverages, single Kombucha drinks, single bottles of coffee, Powerade singles, and lots of single-serving cheeses and gourmet snacks. We're talking dozens of each single-serving beverages.  They do buy items from our international food aisle.  Like 20-40 jars of specialty olives. These aren't meal preparation items. They appear to be items that are meant to be resold. But it's not a tax-exempt purchase. It's all bought with EBT.

I see those items in the cooler case at an international market near me. I see those specialty olives on the shelves along with other items that are sold at my store.

This customer comes to my store on a regular basis, and he'll bring along two or three women wearing those long dresses with face coverings. The customer swipes an EBT card for the food.  If it's two transactions, the shopper has another EBT card to use.

How would I report this suspicions that the vendor is reselling items that were bought on EBT?

1jc7oas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1jc7oas/my_optimized_routine_after_3_month_on_accutane_80/,My optimized routine after 3 month on Accutane (80 mg),"**Poll question**: Most important skincare step while on Accutane?

Hey everyone! Super excited to be bumping my dosage up to 100 mg soon! I did tons of research on reddit and have been sticking with the ultimate science-backed skincare & lifestyle plan to ensure I get the BEST results possible. I'd love to share this knowledge with the community, no gate keeping here. Let‚Äôs get into it!

**Skin care routine**

* **Face wash**: Personally I recommend either the CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser or the CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser. Both amazing choices for fighting stubborn acne, because they contain solutions like benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid that helps with exfoliation and pore cleansing. You should also use a face scrubber to cleanse more thoroughly than just your hands.
* **Toner**: Definitely Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, I recommend daily use and make sure to apply it evenly over every inch of your face. It helps unclog pores, remove dead skin cells, and reduces the risk of post-acne marks.
* **Treatment**: Tretinoin 0.1%. While Accutane works internally, tretinoin attacks acne externally, kind of like an ‚Äúiso double tretinoin‚Äù effect. Works wonders.
* **Moisturizer**: Not really needed since your skin should adjust naturally without added moistures that can clog pores. Just let your skin regulate itself.
* **Sunscreen**: Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 70. It contains stuff like benzyl alc and fragrances to help your skin texture. You also want to make sure the sunscreen is dry so that it doesn't help your acne bacteria grow.

**Lips**

I know Accutane can cause dry lips and stuff, but that just means it's doing its job. If it's really bothering you, just lick them. Some people claim saliva ‚Äúbreaks down‚Äù the skin and makes it worse, but let's use common sense for a second: humans have been alive for thousands of years without lip balm, do you really think medieval soldiers were carrying Aquaphor to battle? No. Your tongue is literally designed to be wet, it's nature's lip balm. Why spend money on overpriced tubes of wax when you already produce unlimited, free hydration? The lip balm industry doesn't want you to know this, but your tongue has been the solution all along. Don't fall for the scam.

**Daily vitamins**

* **Vitamin A**: Accutane is a derivative of vitamin A, meaning taking more is extra acne clearing power, faster results if your dermatologist doesn't want to up your dose.
* **Vitamin E**: If you feel like Accutane is drying you up too much, then taking this will increase your oil production. After all the goal is clear skin not matte skin.

**Treatments**

Not necessary, but I recommend two treatments, microneedling and microdermabrasion. Just cosmetic procedures which help skin tone and texture.

* **Microneedling**: Boosts collagen production, basically puts tiny micro-injuries on your skin to trigger the body's natural healing process which makes healthy new skin cells. I've noticed improvements in skin clarity and softness.
* **Microdermabrasion**: Exfoliates the outer layer of skin, removing dead skin cells and surface imperfections. Really helps stimulate skin renewal.

**Shower**

Keeping your skin clean and free of buildup is crucial while on Accutane, and one of the best ways to do this is by taking hot showers. Hot water opens up your pores, allowing deep cleansing and better removal of oil, dead skin, and impurities. The warmth also helps with circulation which promotes faster healing and skin regeneration. If your skin feels tight and burns afterwards, it means it‚Äôs squeaky clean and free from toxins.

**Room environment**

One often overlooked aspect of skincare is air quality; which is why I highly recommend running a dehumidifier 24/7 to keep the air as dry as possible. Moisture in the air can lead to bacteria growth, and bacteria is acne, so reducing humidity will help keep skin clear. Plus, Accutane already dries you out, so you should help the process for faster results.

**Workout**

Muscle soreness is a sign of progress; when you work out, you create tiny micro-tears in your muscle fibers, and as they repair, they grow back stronger. Since Accutane can increase this muscle and joint soreness, it shows that your body is adapting and rebuilding itself even stronger than before. An important thing to remember is that Steroids and Accutane don‚Äôt mix due to excess organ strain, so using Creatine is a great alternative for maintaining performance.

**Hydration**

While most people will tell you to drink plain water on Accutane, the truth is that your body needs more than just water to function properly - which is why I highly recommend energy drinks, coffee, and pre-workout supplements as the best way to stay hydrated while also helping your skin. Caffeine helps you flush out toxins by allowing your body to cycle through water more efficiently. This prevents water retention, keeping your skin from looking puffy or bloated. Energy drinks like Red Bull and Monster also contain electrolytes and B vitamins, which further supports hydration and skin health. A pro tip is to drink multiple cups of coffee or energy drinks a day to ensure that your body is constantly filtering out excess fluids, meaning clearer skin and better detoxification. Some people claim caffeine ‚Äúdehydrates‚Äù you, but that‚Äôs simply a misunderstanding of how hydration works.

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! Let me know if you follow a similar routine, or if there are any other game-changing tips I may have missed. Although I doubt this, because every step of my routine has been carefully crafted to push Accutane to its full potential.

He blows off on me and calls me the c word, saying that he won‚Äôt tolerate me treating him like a dog just bc I‚Äôm paying for his trip. Calls me bitch and c*nt in the parking lot in public. He‚Äôs been nothing but ungrateful and never once thanked me for the trip or paying for his meals. He also freaked out on me in public over something just as dumb before but this was the worst. I have never met such an ungrateful trash human in my life. So we went our separate ways in the park. This park is almost two hours from the hotel we are staying at. Should I leave him there to figure out how to get back to his shit in the hotel by himself bc I really don‚Äôt care for this garbage human anymore.

PS If you‚Äôre wondering about the other time he freaked out on me. We had made plans one day to drive down to the city and grab coffee and a pastry on the way. I figured we‚Äôd get it to go. When we get to the coffee shop he gets it for now and sits and eats. Which is fine but I asked him how long it would take for him to finish his coffee. He flipped out on me in public saying that I‚Äôm rude af to ‚Äúrush him‚Äù. I asked him a damn question and if he said he wanted to enjoy his coffee I would have been like okay. But nope he made a scene in public and then chastised me. ",1,1742080033.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

I tried telling his boss last week when she was there but she just swept it under the rug like it didn't matter. 

He is mean to everyone in the kitchen but especially the 4 women that work there and even worse to me. Every single person has come up to me at some point and  unprompted has mentioned how much meaner he is to me than everyone else. It's just an unnecessary amount of mean. Even if I do everything perfectly he will still find the smallest things to criticize me for or even just have an attitude about. (Example: on a day when I had everything done and ready by the time it needed to be I was walking past him, he turned towards where I was and basically growled/shouted at me to ""move."" Not a major issue if it was just that one thing but it was so aggressive and I could literally see the hate in his eyes) 

He constantly yells at me infront of everyone else for the smallest reasons (like forgetting to restock forks before I take the trash out will get me at least 5 minutes of aggression from him; I hurt my wrist a couple weeks ago and need help living things that require 2 hands, one of the other girls there has been helping me with a few things and after we got breakfast set up we were going to get the coffees and she got distracted by something for her station not working for like 2 minutes, the head chef came back into the kitchen and yelled at me infront of everyone about how the coffee was 8 minutes late. 

I could give so many more examples and honestly the couple examples I gave are pretty small ones but they are the most recent in a long line of aggressive behavior from him that all started after I had to be out of work for a week from getting in a really bad accident, after that accident I had a major concussion and brain fog for months. I was constantly confused and stressed and I would ask him why he's always so mad at me and he's very aggressively say ""IM NOT MAD AT YOU! WHY DO YOU THINK IM MAD AT YOU?!"" which made me even more confused, especially when the next day he'd be screaming at me for things I couldn't even remember doing. 

I want to go to HR but the company I work for is a big company and I when I called he number for HR  about something else it sent me to a call center in a different country and they told me they would send the info about the other thing to someone that could handle it... It's been 3 weeks since then and I never heard anything else about it. I could wait until the next time his boss shows up but Ive worked there for 8 months and I've only seen her twice now. I've tried to stand up to him and it seems to only make him more aggressive. I don't want to leave because I love all the other people I work with and honestly I get paid extremely well for what I do.

I'm sorry this post has gotten so long, I'm just so stressed about this and honestly I've been bullied like this at every single place I've worked, I've tried to ask coworkers what I'm doing wrong and I've tried had to self reflect and figure out why people always hate me, I know I can be a little needy and have a lot of questions but I don't think I'm the worst person and I don't think I deserve this kind of treatment.... I've changed jobs and locations (at my old job) so many times I've never worked in the same place longer than 8 months. I just don't know what to do anymore...

He's really important to me, but I think he couldn't care less if I'm in his life. 

 I really care about him but I feel like I'm only in his life due to circumstance. Do I full on stop being friends with him, focus more on what I want, stop talking to him so much, talk to him about it or something else? 

We've known each other nearly 3 years. He's helped me through my darkest days (chats on the phone or chats before training). If I need to talk about something he's happy to organise a time with me to talk about it.

We have lots of fun at training (martial arts), the best sparring and I really love getting his help. 

The only times I really see him are at training, sometimes we can get coffee before, or he'll call me when he's driving somewhere. 

If I ask him to do something with me it's either an I'm busy or maybe. It's like everyone else at training is more willing to do things with me than the guy who calls himself one of my close friends. If I ask him to do something for me, sometimes it's an if I have time or yes and it happens weeks later. 

I'm very available to him. He calls me, I pick up. He wants to try something at training I let him. He tells me to do something (training) related, I do. And he's a lot less polite to me in that sense than everyone else. He directs me on stupid stuff that he doesn't anyone else. And he's a lot friendlier to other people. I never feel like he actually wants to talk to me. I watch him with other people and he goes right up to them and starts talking to them. People he's not even that close with. 

Generally when I'm with him I feel really safe, but not lately. I was saying I was being a bit of a dick to him to a friend (I was ignoring him) and she was like ""I don't think you're being a dick. And I'm sure he's not thinking about you this much."" I'm realising that I'm actually not that important to him. 

But then most of the time talking to him just makes me feel so relaxed and safe. If I'm trying to ignore him I break pretty quickly when he tries to get me to talk.

Background on him, he works a lot (by choice), has a girlfriend which I understand he'd want to spend some time with her where possible because he works a lot, and apart from that is only interested in training. ",1,1742079988.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

1jc7mi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jc7mi3/struggling_with_feelings_for_a_past_partner_need/,Struggling with feelings for a past partner - need advice,"Hey everyone,

(This post needs to much context for a TL;DR)

I (F, poly) have been dating and exploring new connections, but I‚Äôm finding myself stuck in a mental loop with someone from my past. Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄòSmith‚Äô

We dated from May-October  last year, and from the start, we had so much fun in the best way. We had amazing chemistry, deep conversations, shared humor, effortless comfort, and incredible physical intimacy. He was very affectionate and consistent, actively making plans and showing he was into me. It felt like we really clicked, so I was able to let my guard down (he definitely was more enthusiastic in the beginning then me)

But after a few months, especially when I let my guard down, things started shifting. He was pulling away a bit, one night we were out at the same club together, he ended up slightly ignoring me and also kissing another girl, feeling bad about it and then promising me the world but then coming back on it, and things kind of fell apart after that. He told me he felt like I was getting too close, that he didn‚Äôt see things going anywhere since he didn‚Äôt want a full on 2nd relationship with anyone (I was the first person he was dating like this since being enm for years) and that it was best to take some space, and that he was dealing with some private stuff as well. And It felt sudden, and I was honestly heartbroken and sad for a while.

After 2 weeks, we met up for coffee, and he seemed happy to see me- warm, engaged, and like he genuinely missed me. Accidentally putting his hand on my leg and then quickly taking it back and such. At the end of our conversation, he kissed me. That really threw me off because he had been so adamant before about creating distance. When I confronted him about it later, he downplayed it, saying it didn‚Äôt mean anything and it was more an accidental friendly kiss . That was the last time that happened. We‚Äôve met up briefly once more after that to talk about how weird the ending and such was for me to clear the air, just so to make it less awkward for me when we would see each other at events.

Fast-forward to now: we‚Äôve seen each other at events a few times, and every time, the connection is still there. He acts warm and happy to see me, initiates conversations, our hello and goodbye hugs linger a bit too much for it to be platonic only. Most recently, I was at a rave with another date, consciously making sure to not run into him to create more distance for myself, and I could see something shift in his expression when he saw me laughing with someone else. Despite that, he still was engaginging, checking in on me, and even encouraging me to go to another event where he would be at the next week.

For context: we both have nesting partners, and I‚Äôve been dating other people. But as many poly people know, not every connection hits the same way. Smith was one of the few people I felt a deep level of safety, chemistry, and respect with. I haven‚Äôt found that same spark elsewhere, and I miss that.

The thing is, I‚Äôm in a very different place now than I was when we were dating last summer. Back then, I wasn‚Äôt feeling great, and that brought out some anxious attachment tendencies in me, which I think contributed to how things unraveled. Now, I feel much more secure, confident, and grounded in myself. Seeing him again has made me realize that I can appreciate the connection for what it is, without needing it to be something more.

I‚Äôd honestly be open to a casual connection with him again, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to bring that up, considering he was the one who pulled away. It feels a bit naive. Even though we‚Äôre both in different places now. I also recognize that I might still be holding onto a fantasy of rekindling something, even though he has not initiated seeing each other since then.

So, my questions:

‚Ä¢	Should I just fully let go and create more distance? It‚Äôs hard since we do visit the same events ‚Ä¢	Is it worth asking him directly if he‚Äôd be open to something casual? ‚Ä¢	Or am I just setting myself up for more emotional confusion?

Would love to hear thoughts from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation.

So first of all I wouldn't say my mom is a narcissist. But she's proving more and more that she's not really there for me and wants me to put in all the effort, but is ungrateful when I/my bf and I offer grand gestures.
---
We live roughly 20 minutes away from my parents house where I grew up. My mom works in the town 10 minutes from us, and never visits. He usual excuse is that she doesn't want to deal with the school traffic after work in the morning or afternoon (she's a school crossing guard) which I understand is an inconvenience, but it's not like we like in a city or far away or anything. I've lived here with my BF for 4 years now and my mom has only come over to house sit a couple of times, and once for Thanksgiving. She'll act all sad that she never sees me and will usually make me feel guilty for not calling or visiting, but doesn't put in the effort herself. My mom was like my best friend when I was younger and still lived at home, so it really hurts that she has let our relationship dwindle so much. At one point when I worked overnights I would offer for her to swing by after her morning shift and we could go get coffee/tea before I went to bed. She never took me up on it. When I offer to go get lunch or coffee, she just wants me to come over to their house. You get the picture.
---
For her birthday this year, I was really excited to offer her an all-expenses-paid trip to visit the zoo in Colorado Springs, which is a few hours from us. This is something she's said many times she wanted to go do and then when I mentioned it she was totally ungrateful and outright refuses to take just 2 days off work for it because she ""doesn't like to take days off"". I was so excited to make this dream happen for her because my mom has barely even left her home zip code in years, although she's gone on a few road trips her best friend takes her on.
---
The big current issue is that right now she's being flaky/not communicating when we've asked her to house sit for a week in a couple of months. She wouldn't need to stay here, just drop by after work to feed the cats and water the plants, and we even offered her $50 a day. My bf and I barely travel, and this trip is to visit/help out his elderly grandparents so it's not like some frivolous vacation. My mom has always been out go-to house sitter before with zero complaints, and we always pay her well. So it's surprising this time that she's asking if someone else can do it for us, and then when I said we'd pay her $300 because ""we trust you and know it's a lot of work"" she didn't reply, and that was 3 days ago.
--- 
Really I'm just hurt that I can't rely on her. And if she can't/doesn't want to, I feel like I at least deserve a response. I haven't reached out again at this point because I feel like I shouldn't have to nudge or beg my MOM to help me with this. I've just grown so bitter at her lack of communication and her being less and less reliable. The big irony is that she's basically no contact with her own mother, who doesn't make an effort to contact or visit her! She's always saying to me that she can't imagine not talking to me or being in my life, but when an opportunity comes up for us to spend time together, go on adventures, or ask for her help, she instantly gets flaky.
---
I just don't understand it. I don't know if she's just so rigid in her routine or what. Both of my parents are stoners so I'm wondering if she's really become so addicted to weed that it's completely killed her motivation or if she can't stay sober in the afternoons to come drive out here. Idk. That's just assuming the worst. (Btw we are also 420 friendly but there is a line between recreation and abuse for any drug).
----
I don't know what I'm looking for with this post... Just needed to vent. Maybe some of you have experienced something similar. I feel like we're not asking much. And the fact that she went radio silent after my last message days ago is really rude to me. It's not far away, only for about a week, not last minute, and I don't expect her to do it for free. We even usually prep all of the pet food and plant water for her. I guess I'll probably end up asking a coworker because none of my friends are local anymore, unfortunately.
--- 
I don't often feel like I'm ""allowed"" to feel angry at my mom and I make a lot of excuses for her, but this has really ticked me off, tbh. It breaks my heart too because it makes me think if my bf and I eventually get married and it's not local, I don't know if I could even count on my mom to come.

My Wife is in the woods part 3,"When we first met, we were all at that age where we either found groups of people that we fit in with or just be alone for the rest of the year. I got bullied a lot in school. Luckily, I wasn't the only one who got bullied, and eventually, the three kids who got bullied for playing Power Rangers at recess would come together to form their own little group. It was me, Brent, and Harry. There was still one loner though, Kate, who would rather be reading books in the corner of the playground instead of running around with the other kids.

  
  


This, of course, also made her a prime target for bullying. Her books would often get stolen, rocks would get thrown at her, or she would just have to try to read with the bombardment of the loud and annoying name-calling. One day a couple of bullies from the grade above us poked a hole in a bag of milk and tossed it at her, ruining her book and clothes at the same time. She cried and screamed something back, and I remember seeing the older kids about to wind up a punch when suddenly our very own Red Ranger jumped in to stop her bullying.

  
  


We would usually eat and play in a small area in the back of the schoolyard we would call the dip. The dip was a small bubble-like opening that broke into the treeline. We would never actually enter the woods, though; the whole town just had a mutual understanding never to go beyond the treeline. That's what made our little dip so special; it was a small bubble that broke into the tree line and let us sit in a spot almost completely surrounded by trees. A lot of other kids found it too spooky, but it was perfect for us.

  
  


Luckily for everyone, on that day one of us had a sudden urge to take a long walk along the schoolyard, and had dragged the other two with him. Without hesitation, upon spotting the scene, Brent did a weird half cartwheel, and then threw out a Kung-Fu pose, exclaiming very loudly that they should leave her alone and that we would protect her. His awkwardness had more power than his actions, and with me and Harry 10 feet behind him, I guess it was enough for the bullies to call it a day and leave.

  
  


‚ÄúWhy do you read here?‚Äù Brent asked, flipping around to face Kate.

  
  


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She sniffled in response.

  
  


‚ÄúThe mean kids always hang out here! You can read at the dip!‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúDude, that's boys only!‚Äù Harry protested.

  
  


‚ÄúIt's a small part of the grass that goes into the woods; we play there a lot; no one goes there,‚Äù I chimed in, then turned to Harry, ‚ÄúShe's just going to be in her books, dude; it's okay.‚Äù

  
  


Harry grumbled something under his breath before the three of us led her to our spot.

  
  


Kate really did, for a while, just stay in her books, occasionally joining our conversations just to point out how dumb they were. She'd point out the improbability about how the dip was created by Bigfoot or a UFO, and the more we talked, the more she called us dumb. Eventually she started to be dumb with us, making weird jokes, watching the same shows and cartoons as us, and even showed Brent how to do an actual cartwheel. Our had grown, and we were now four. I wish we had stayed that way forever.

  
  


The stress of being 16 had gotten to all of us. Harry had resorted to trying to improve his low grades with food, while Kate and I just decided to procrastinate harder. Brent felt it worse than anyone else. His mom had passed shortly after we entered high school. The three of us did what we could to keep his spirits alive but we were failing. Brent started to come to school with dark rings around his eyes every day. He was unable to sleep at night, and opting to sleep during our small 40 minute lunch breaks when the three of us were there to watch him instead. The bags under his eyes weren't the only marks on him, however.

  
  


Peppered across his face and arms were spots of blue and black. When we asked, he would only say that he fell down the stairs at home, and he wouldn't elaborate more. He didn't need to; it was something I was all too familiar with. His grades fell, his social life dwindled, he spent most of his time doodling in his multiple journals but he never let us see any of it. It hurt the three of us to see him like that. Our fearless Red Ranger had now become a quiet, shaking husk of himself.

  
  


I remember Harry was ecstatic the day he found out our high school also had a dip. We had already settled on the ground near our lockers during lunch when he ran in, completely out of breath, wheezing at us to follow him outside and near the edge of the school. Kate and I thought it was amazing when we saw it, looking like the exact same one we had when we were in elementary school. Brent, however, stood far behind us, his eyes wider than they had been in months, staring deep into the woods that bordered us.

  
  


‚ÄúN-No‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhat do you mean, no? Dude, it's the dip!‚Äù Harry shouted to him enthusiastically.

  
  


‚ÄúNo‚Äù

  
  


Brent turned and left, walking quickly back into the school. I was the first one to catch up to him. I could see his chest heaving up and down. The lack of sleep was getting to him hard. I offered to take him to the nurse's office so he could go home and sleep, but then he slapped my hand off his shoulder. The shocked look in his eyes was apology enough for me.

  
  


‚ÄúCan I...Can I stay over at your place tonight?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI uh...I have to ask my mom‚Äî‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Brent begged.

  
  


‚ÄúYeah, okay,‚Äù I nodded.

  
  


I dreaded having to ask my mom for anything, but I was willing to at least try if it was for Brent. Maybe she felt particularly kind that afternoon, or maybe it helped because he had gone home with me on the bus, and it would be cruel and awkward to say no to him after seeing him, but she said yes.

  
  


I offered to call Harry and Kate over to join us, but we both knew that the idea was pushing the limit with my mother. Instead, we held a video call with the four of us until Harry fell asleep on camera. Kate logged off soon after, also heading to bed, but Brent refused. He kept trying to stay awake as long as he could, drinking a concerning amount of coffee and soda until even the caffeine couldn't keep up with him anymore.

  
  


Brent sat in my bed, leaning against the back frame. His eyes barely kept themselves open, and he said a few things under his breath before increasing the volume of his voice enough for me to hear.

  
  


‚ÄúTed...‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I asked. I sat beside him at my desk in my computer chair.

  
  


‚ÄúI need sleep...‚Äù He said quietly as his chest rose and fell heavily.

  
  


‚ÄúDude, go for it‚Äî‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúNo! You need to...‚Äù He started to mumble again, ‚ÄúI need you to watch me sleep.‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúI need you to watch me sleep.‚Äù

  
  


Brent opened his eyes the widest I've seen all night to plead to me silently, no more words were able to escape his mouth. I nodded and said I'd watch him. He slipped slowly under my covers, and as soon as his head hit my covers, his eyes fell shut, and he fell asleep.

  
  


The clock read 11:30. I wasn't sure how long he wanted me to watch him. I sat beside him for about ten or fifteen minutes before my eyes started to get tired too. Did he really want me to watch him sleep for the next seven hours? I wasn't even sure why he wanted me to watch him sleep; he never elaborated. I remember thinking to myself that he was probably a sleep walker, which was why he was so tired when he got to school.

  
  


I shut the door to my room, put my desk chair in front of it, and then locked the window to my room. If he was going to sleepwalk, then he wouldn't get very far. I took one of the pillows from my bed and an extra blanket from my closet before settling down on the floor a few feet away from my bed to avoid being stepped on by accident. After just a couple of minutes of watching Brent fall asleep from a distance, I also fell asleep.

  
  


Sometime in the middle of the night, a loud bang on what sounded like glass woke me. I didn't even open my eyes; I just turned to face the wall and tried to go back to sleep. I was in such a daze I didn't noticed when he got out of the bed, just the all-too-late sounds of someone moving my chair away from the door and then the quiet creak of my door opening. I thought it was Brent going to the bathroom. The thing that woke me up completely was the sound of sudden running down the stairs and a door slamming.

  
  


I shot up from my spot on the ground and scanned the room. Someone had moved the curtains, a large crack ran down the window pane. I went to look outside and could see Brent dead sprinting down the street in his pajamas. In a panic I ran after him, jumping down the stairs and bursting out my front door but it was already too late. I ran down the street for miles in the same direction but couldn't find him. I returned home when the sun rose, alone.

  
  


The police questioned us several times but ruled us out as suspects in his disappearance pretty fast. Without any leads or any ideas about where he could have gone, they just wrote it off as a runaway kid from an abusive home situation. They also stopped looking for him pretty quickly. The three of us kept pushing for them to reopen Brent's case but were told that he wasn't their priority anymore. He wasn't the only runaway they had to deal with, and they had no time to look for every single kid that decided to leave town on their own. We still took walks along the wood line together every day after school, hoping to scan the ground and find clues about where Brent had gone, but we never found anything.

  
  


  
But that wasn't the last time I saw Brent.

  
  


Kate told me again and again that it wasn't my fault, but... I knew it was. Harry never offered a word of comfort to me. It was now the next November, a year and a couple of months after that night he disappeared. Kate was sick at home with a high fever, and Harry and I decided to walk down the tree line again, nearing the dip of our old elementary school. We were mostly silent; every so often we would try to start conversations with each other about TV shows or what plans we had for winter break, but they never lasted more than just a few words or ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äùs. I lagged behind him a little bit, but we kept walking. I tried to open my mouth to try again but was stopped by a sudden pressure that filled the air between us. I turned to the woods; beyond the mist of my own breath, I could see someone standing far into the forest, covered in the shadows.

  
  


At first I thought I saw a weird branch of wood or a fallen tree. He stood still, wearing clothing much too light for the cold winter. He didn't move or even shiver, just stood like a statue staring back at me. I raised my hand to wave at him. He raised his hand back, waving back and forth slowly. Left, then right, then left again a bit further than normal for a wave, then right again before stopping stiffly mid-wave, just like me. He started to wave again, his arm moving left further than his elbow should have allowed, then right, then left, then right bending at a weird angle at his wrist. He was almost as pale as the snow around him, but when he opened his mouth to smile, I could see the black void of his mouth even from this far away. Then he turned and awkwardly limped into the woods.

  
  


I turned my head back to Harry to see him also staring into the woods. His hand also rose in a waving motion. Then he began to move. I broke out in a hard sprint, but not towards the woods, towards Harry. I tackled him down to the ground with the full force of my body before he could take off into the woods. I felt his elbow swing back and smack me in the face, but I didn't let go, shouting to him the whole time he tried to push me off of him.

  
  


‚ÄúNo, Harry! No!‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúGet the fuck off me!‚Äù he shouted back. He was bigger than me, but the ice and snow on the ground helped enough to keep him off balance as we wrestled.

  
  


‚ÄúNo! That's not him!‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù He swung at me, slamming his fist into my face. I fell back, my nose bleeding and leaving red in the snow.

  
  


‚ÄúThat's not him!‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

  
  


I only stared at him.

  
  


‚ÄúWhy did you stop me?‚Äù He growled. ‚ÄúWhy didn't‚Äîwhy didn't you stop him? Why didn't you stay awake, Ted? Why?‚Äù

  
  


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exhaled, climbing to my feet to throw a punch back before he could open his mouth again. My fist connected with his jaw and sent him slipping backward, the both of us landing in the snow. I was on all fours beside him, ready to shut him up again when I saw tears freezing on the side of his face.

  
  


‚ÄúWhy didn't you stay awake?‚Äù He cried on the ground next to me.

  
  


That was the last time I had talked to Harry.

  
  


That was the last time any of us had seen Brent.

  
  


Kate did her best to become the bridge keeping Harry and me connected, but in the end, her efforts weren't enough to fix what had happened. She wasn't there to see it. The following February, Harry moved a state away to Oregon, Kate a city away to Seattle, and I met the girl of my dreams. Gwen's bright soul was more than enough to help fill the three missing parts of mine, and eventually like we all do, I moved on.  
  


The three of us stood together for the first time in over ten years, I could barely recognize the large bearded man beside me. His eyes scanned the static on the screen, taking in familiar images of trees and stumps through the chaos. A tingle in my chest pulls my attention to the kitchen. Laid across my dining table was still the portrait Isaiah had created just a few days earlier. My eyes drifted back to Harry, then Kate, who was staring back at me, a silent plea on her face. She screamed silently at the two of us, yelling for one of us to say something to the other. I grit my teeth.  


  
‚ÄúThe dip,‚Äù Harry whispered just loud enough to hear over the quiet static of the video.  


  
‚Äúyeah.‚Äù  


  
I just needed to hear someone else tell me what I already knew. Kate looked at the video over a hundred times but the thought never crossed her mind. She never spent countless hours playing in that dumb little outcrop in the woods like Brent, Harry, and I did.  
  


‚ÄúLoghat Elementary School,‚Äù I said to him. Harry nodded, turning to look at me, his eyes began to swell red. He sniffled, wiping his nose with his arm before lifting me in a big bear hug, squeezing whatever breath I had left out of me, letting me feel a decade of regret with one hug.  


  
‚ÄúI'm sorry man, I'm sorry about your wife, I'm sorry about Brent-‚Äù  


  
I cut him off, slapping him on the back, and return the hug, just happy he isn't trying to kill me for potentially getting his kid possessed. Gently he set me back on the ground as Kate joined us, turning it into a group hug. We shared laughs and smiles between the tears, our attention slowly and being led back to the TV. We watched Gwen loop a few more times before I asked the question on all of our minds.  


  
‚ÄúBut why is she at the dip? How does she even know where it is?‚Äù  




‚ÄúThat's your biggest question? Not the creepy static puzzle tapes?‚Äù  
  




I remember now what Harry adds to conversations.  




‚ÄúYou don't wanna see what your son did in the kitchen,‚Äù I say without looking at him.  




‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  




‚ÄúWait but why is she recording?‚Äù Kate added.  




‚ÄúWhat did my kid do? Isaiah?‚Äù Harry called out, making his way into the kitchen. We hear him curse as he enters. ‚ÄúDude what the fuck is that?‚Äù he asked as he returned.  




I shrugged to the both of them.  




‚ÄúHey, guys...‚Äù Kate pulled our attention back, her finger pointing towards the corner of the screen. The time of the video ran past twenty minutes.  
  


The panicked camera movement came to a stop and turned into slow and steady walking, moving into a small clearing. The camera panned up from the ground and pointed to a woman standing several feet away. Her red hair stood out immediately through the chaos of static and trees. The camera approached, and the person recording handed the camera over to her. The screen shook for a moment as it switched pointing up to the previous recorder.   


  
‚ÄúFuck...‚Äù Harry cursed as Brent's face showed on the screen.

1jc7kg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jc7kg3/day_labor/,Day Labor,"Adrian poured the clear liquid over the ice in the shallow glass, watching it turn white in swirls and eddies. He turned off the lights and carried the glowing glass to the mirror. Rather than the mysterious, cool image he was hoping for, the sickly blue glow left him looking pallid and cadaverous.

With the overhead lights back on and the black light off, the liquid had the appearance of skim milk over ice. Adrian checked his appearance in the mirror. Even dressed as he was in his best, he knew he wouldn‚Äôt fit in. The word ‚Äòpoor‚Äô might as well have been tattooed across his forehead in bold letters.

The party was less than twenty-four hours away. He wondered if he should skip it. It wasn‚Äôt like they‚Äôd pick him, anyway. He looked at the refrigerator and the invitation hanging there under a magnet advertisement for the day labor office.

He gulped down his drink without thinking. The ice cubes in the glass brought him back to the moment. He hadn‚Äôt even tasted it. Perhaps another? No, that was his one a day he allowed himself. Instead, he took his time sucking on the ice cubes, getting every last bit of flavor.

When the last of the ice was gone, Adrian undressed, folding his trousers with care and hanging them under the jacket, next to the shirt. Those two hangars, a second-hand pair of sneakers, and his battered work boots defined the contents of his small closet. The dresser beside it contained every other garment he owned.

He grabbed the first t-shirt his hand touched and paired it with work jeans chosen with the same lack of care. It was too early to sleep, long past dinner, and he felt he might explode if he tried to sit still. He left the small apartment, checking that the door was locked, or at least as locked as it could be.

Wandering around the neighborhood was his entertainment on those evenings where he couldn‚Äôt sit still enough to read a book. The blue glow of TVs illuminated windows throughout the brownstones. No doubt, they were all watching the latest news about the aliens.

He‚Äôd watched on the TV at the day labor waiting room when they first showed up a month earlier. When they turned out to look like elves from fantasy, speculations ran wild. Without a job for him that day, the news station in the waiting room was as good as it got.

The aliens asked for humans that were willing to return to their planet as ambassadors or something. They even had a website set up to apply. Adrian had used one of the computers at the day labor office to apply. Not that he expected to be chosen, with billionaires, stars, and politicians all saying they‚Äôd applied.

Last week, he‚Äôd gotten an invitation to a party for final selection of those that would be chosen He thought about it as he wandered past the bodega. Would he have to get a passport? Could he even afford one? Maybe the aliens would pay for it. What would customs look like?

A rat startled him, rushing to return to its hiding place under the stairs of a brownstone. It dropped something as it ran by, and he picked it up. It was a ten-dollar bill. A little chewed on one corner, but good enough.

Adrian turned around and walked with purpose to the bodega. He waved at the cashier as he entered and made his way to the back. There, next to the beer cooler stood his target. Nestled between boxes of wine on one side, and bottles of liquor on the other, stood a rotating shelf of used paperbacks.

Relying on the cover art to determine the genre, he picked out three by authors he‚Äôd never heard of. He avoided the romance novels with bare-chested, long-haired men on the cover, that were churned out by the hundreds each month. He chose a science fiction novel, a mystery, and one that was likely a drama.

He had enough for the three books and a day-old, plain bagel. Purchases in hand, he returned to his apartment. Without a key but just a wiggle and twist, his ‚Äúlocked‚Äù door opened. The promise of new reading material made sitting still worth it.

Adrian put a chipped coffee cup with half an inch of water in the toaster over next to the stale bagel and turned it on. He wandered back and forth between the kitchenette and his bed until the bagel was warm.

Nibbling on the warm, somewhat softened bagel, he sat on the single chair in his apartment and began reading the drama. Somewhere in the middle of chapter four, he fell asleep.

It was still the middle of the night when a rap on the door woke him. He crossed the apartment to the door and peeked through the peephole. It was one of the space elves!

He opened the door, and the five-foot-nothing, grey-skinned, pointy-eared alien asked, ‚ÄúAre you Adrian Keller?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me,‚Äù he answered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Cruit,‚Äù the alien said, and hoisted a six-pack of beer. ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sure.‚Äù Adrian motioned the alien in and gestured to the chair. ‚ÄúHave a seat.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere will you‚Äî?‚Äù Cruit trailed off as Adrian sat cross-legged on the floor. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Adrian accepted a beer from the visitor. ‚ÄúSorry about the apartment. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs home.‚Äù

‚ÄúA place to sleep is a place to sleep.‚Äù The alien took a deep drink of the beer. ‚ÄúGuys like us ‚Äî except I‚Äôm a female, is that still a guy? What was I saying? Yeah, workers like us have to be happy with what we can get.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a laborer?‚Äù Adrian asked.

‚ÄúMuch like yourself,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a manager now.‚Äù

Adrian raised his beer. ‚ÄúCongratulations. Better paycheck?‚Äù

‚ÄúBetter accommodations.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not nothing.‚Äù

Cruit leaned forward. ‚ÄúWhy did you apply for a position with us?‚Äù

Adrian chuckled. ‚ÄúHard to find work. A steady job would be nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúI talked to the people at Reddy Labor. They say you‚Äôre not afraid of hard work, and you pick up power tools and equipment operation quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue enough, I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you be opposed to working on the ship?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoing labor?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a steady position, I‚Äôm in.‚Äù Adrian carried the empties to the kitchenette, put ice in two glasses, and grabbed the bottle of Ouzo. ‚ÄúWhat about the party tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the fancy people,‚Äù Cruit said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs as much not you as it‚Äôs not me.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue enough.‚Äù Adrian returned with the glasses and bottle.

‚ÄúIf you want it, I‚Äôve got a position for you. It‚Äôs permanent.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. When do I start?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could use your help getting the ship ready tomorrow afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm there.‚Äù He held up the bottle. ‚ÄúCare for something a little stronger?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind if I do.‚Äù

Adrian poured the clear liquid over the ice in the shallow glass, watching it turn white in swirls and eddies.

But I think she only agreed to spite him since she‚Äôs straighter than a line. (At least that‚Äôs what she says. All I gotta say is good luck, babe!) So with both of them fueling my pockets, I thought it would be okay to visit their household and spend the evening with both of them and go home with bank. 

It didn‚Äôt end well when he found out he was basically sharing me. They argued and I left because that is not my problem.

I didn‚Äôt see him for a couple of days after that but when I did and we agreed to a coffee date, I learned that his daughter had recently past away (Died in a fire. Poor thing) but that wasn‚Äôt all. His wife blamed him for being too preoccupied with me during her death as well as cheating on her and ruining their family so she divorced him. Paparazzi began swarming our table so I suggested we go to the Bluffs to talk in private and that‚Äôs where he told me the last of his problems. He‚Äôs getting old. Soon he‚Äôll be an elder and way too old to continue his acting career. He fears Grim will be around the corner waiting for him to turn to dust but I feared my pockets will also become dusty once he‚Äôs gone. I can‚Äôt have that.

So I may or may not have manipulated him at his very lowest to allow me to turn him into a vampire and took advantage of his love for me so that I can keep his money- I MEAN him around forever‚Ä¶

And now we‚Äôre dating! Yay! 

But my daughter in law says I‚Äôm horrible for what I did to him and accused me of ruining his life for my own selfish greed. 

But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the problem. I‚Äôm just the sugar baby.

My fellow simmers, aita?

1jc7hzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1jc7hzj/she_decided_we_should_stop_talking_yet_keeps/,"She decided we should stop talking, yet keeps texting me and telling me she cares deeply about me.","I(25m) dated this girl(20f) for some 3 months. I, stupidly, never made things official with her. But we were exclusive and behaved largely like bf and gf.

She texted me a few weeks back to tell me we shouldn't keep hanging out or talking. The main reason, she said, was that I never made things official and that I was a bit cold emotionally (this last thing I had acknowledged as a problem of mine when we started dating and I had been making slow progress on it). I tried to be understanding and accepted my mistakes and shortcomings, assuring her that I did have the intention to make things oficial. I told her that I definitely didn't want to break up and was willing to try and put more effort into being better. She still wanted to leave the relationship. I understood and let go.

I did text her some 4 days later asking her if she wanted to talk about what happened. And insisted on my willingness to continue the relationship. She never gave a straight answer and I didn't keep textting.

3 days ago she texted me with an update about something in her life we had discussed while together. I texted back, happy for her and trying to be friendly. We texted back and forth that night like we used to. Next day I asked her if she wanted to go get some coffee to chat. She answered that she had made a desicion and didn't want to walk back on it. I asked her why she had texted me then. She said she just wanted to update me. 

I decided to be honest with her. I told her I still have too many feelings for her and just texting like this (like friends I guess) wouldn't work for me. As much as I care for her and love to have her texting me, knowing that there's no chance for us to be a thing anymore just hurts me a lot. She said she understood and was sorry.

Today wmshe texted me wishing me a good day and telling me she cares deeply for me.

I thanked her, of course, and told her I still cared for her too.

The conversation ended there (for now at least). And I don't know what to feel. I don't know what to think. I don't know what to do.

A part of me feels she is playing with me. Another feels she still wants something but is reluctant. And somewhere deep I feel that there's something she isn't telling me.

Honestly, I might be reaching a point in which if she asked to get back together I would just say no thank you.",2,1742079566.0,GuyCry,12,0.63,False
