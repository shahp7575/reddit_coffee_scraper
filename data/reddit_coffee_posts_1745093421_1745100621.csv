He’s never really gotten me just because flowers or showed up with my fav coffee etc. We have been dating for a little over 3 years now. I love him very much but this has always bothered me. I do these things for him so I would think that he would know that it is a thing he could do. I have kinda told him this before but at the same time I don’t want him to do something because I am asking. I want him to do it because he wants to. He has done surprises on like Valentine’s Day this year and stuff but never really just because. Well Easter is on Sunday and he texted me to come outside my house because he was there and I got super excited and he showed up with his mom and they give me an Easter basket. I was super excited because he thought of me. Then I texted him that it was super sweet and he replied with “of course baby! It was all my mom!” this text kinda took some of the excitement away from me because I thought that he had actually done it. Now I get if he maybe went with his mom to get the stuff and drop it off because I do that too. But to say it was all his mom makes me think it was her idea and so me thinking that he did all of that kinda took some of that away. I am not sure if this is really a valid feeling? Or if anyone has dealt with something similar? If so how do you deal with it? ,1,1745100036.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

However any size V60 would work as well. 

Grind on finer side of what you would for your V60.  I used 7.5 on  the K-Ultra.

I used the standards red Cafec filter

**Smaller Brew by Asser at CC **
8 g/130 ml. 
Pour 65 ml and close at 20-25 seconds. 
Pour 65 ml and open at 2:00 minutes

**My Small Batch Version**
6.5 g/150 ml
Pour 75 ml and close at 20-25 seconds. 
Pour 75 ml and open at 2:00 minutes

TBT for me was around 3:00+ a few seconds. 

I liked the results from both ratios. I bought the Cafec Deep 27 brewer for small batches before I knew how well the Switch could handle them. Knowing what I do now, I'd say skip the Deep 27 if you own the Switch, unless you collect  The Deep 27 is a sweet brewer 

The link above leads to all my *unedited* notes I've taken on the Coffee Chronicler's videos on the Switch.

\- can't sit with my thighs beside each other. I have to cross legs or sit with one knee up (my right) and my foot beside my bottom

\- can't stand like a normal person, legs beside each other. It feels odd. I have to lean on a wall, or squat like a cat.

\- I always leave one thing behind/unfinished. If I eat a sub, I leave one little bite left that I dont eat. If I do dishes, I'll leave 2 or 3 forks and not finish. I don't completely finish even though I can.

\- I often repeat myself twice. When I explain things, I'll repeat the same sentence word for word twice in a row sometimes.

\- I have serious memory issues with names. So difficult to remember. Also have no perception of time, days, how many days ago, what year was that, etc. Also things with numbers. I mix up the numbers often and am horrible at math above grade 10 level (and I'm an adult, lol)

\- I am ALWAYS thirsty and always have a few drinks going. A water, an ice tea and a protein drink usually or gatorade. I am never without liquids have been like that my whole life.

\- honestly think I'm psychic. I often predict things, see things happen before they do, feel like I can feel others pain, feel like I can read people's minds sometimes. Hyper sensitive to others emotions I guess.

\- I am so angry in the morning. Angry, sad, annoyed, tired. I struggle to get out of it and get ready. I get up early for work, 5am, im not able to have a convo until 7ish. Coffee helps calm me down.

1k37e1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1k37e1l/crisis_mode/,Crisis Mode,"*For other stories that relate to the Teyasu and the Rayet, check out my posts.*

Humans unique evolution make them invaluable in a crisis, it's not just their intense durability and physical prowess; It's their *mind.*

# Crisis Mode

“Paras.” Marcus gave a sly grin as he sipped his coffee from the cold can.

“I’m sorry Human-Marcus, I do not know this name.”

“It’s what my granddad called the Teyasu - Paras.” Marcus enjoyed messing with the furry Phiulid, Garina. They were often over-formal in speech and behavior, and regularly struggled with the more chaotic behavior, language, and habits of the Solarians. “On account of them looking like an ancient Earth dinosaur. Parasol - err. Parason... Para-”

“Parasaurolophus.” Elodie continued to work at her tablet even as she half-listened to Marcus and Garina.

Marcus raised his can in a mock toast, “that’s it! Elodie the Brain always with the answer!”

The three of them were working on the secondary reactor stack deep in the bowels of the Teyasu Starport. Two of their Teyasu counterparts had departed for lunch. The last one, a young and uncharacteristically energetic Teyasu named Korta, watched Elodie’s datapad as she worked out the advanced calculations to properly balance the reactor. 

Elodie paused to look at Korta. “I’m sorry about him. Some of my colleagues think he comes from a slightly less evolved subspecies of Solarian.”

Korta looked at Elodie, then to Marcus, and finally stopped at Garina. Korta’s large eyes and stocky build reminded Elodie of a stuffie she had as a child, disarming her every time she looked at them. 

Ever-helpful Garina assumed Korta’s expression was curiosity or confusion and offered a response to the unspoken question. “I believe Human-Elodie is referring to Human-Marcus’ ancestral homeland of Scotland. Though I was not aware of any significant evolutionary differences betwee-”“No, I said less *evolved*. Men. I meant *men.*”

Marcus guffawed, “you may be right at that! The Void knows we men can be dumb as-”

The rest of his sentence was engulfed by their entire world instantly turning inside-out. One moment their workroom quietly hummed along as it always had. In the next, it seemed to Elodie a god of chaos had passed through in a fraction of a second, roaring in rage and fury. It left behind a storm of debris and shrapnel in a maelstrom of screaming wind. It was all too much for Elodie to immediately process, but time also seemed to slow to a crawl as her brain took in every detail. The reinforced reactor bulkhead crumpling as it slid away, tearing beams from the ceiling and floor. Sparks flying as conduits split, the thick cables dragged down through the floor along with the bulkhead. Marcus caught mid-laugh even as a pane of transparisteel burst out of the ceiling and tore through the floor next to him, and a spray of blood as it took his drinking arm with it.

An instant later, the time sped back up for Elodie, the blizzard of debris suddenly gone as it was all sucked into the void where the second reactor stack used to be. Now Elodie could see cold, uncaring space and the blue-green curve of Teyasu IV. Elodie’s training kicked in and she was already moving as she switched to crisis mode and her mind buzzed.

*Lights flickering or out - no power in this section. Of course. Reactor 2 is gone.*

*Air still evacuating Emergency bulkheads hadn’t all closed. We have a minute or less of air.*

Marcus was severely injured, but he had already grabbed Garina. He pushed the Phiulid towards the open hatch leading to the interior of the station, fighting upwind against the venting atmosphere. The wind sprayed blood from his severed arm across the room behind him.

Korta stood in utter confusion at all the chaos.Elodie grabbed Korta by his uniform and yanked him towards the same doorway Marcus and Garina were headed towards. They made it halfway across the deck when it lurched again, throwing Garina and Korta to the floor. Marcus instinctually crouched down and kept his feet. Elodie stumbled as the deck lurched and vibrated. The atmosphere venting out of the door they were headed towards stopped, no longer offering any resistance to their escape. 

Marcus lifted Garina up with a single yank, the Phiulid wide-eyed in surprise as he did so. The air was already getting thin and Elodie pointed at the door leading to the outer edge of the station. Marcus sprinted, launching him and Garina toward the door. Elodie scooped up Korta and followed behind him. She could feel Korta wrestling ineffectually to break free of her grip. 

Passing through the door, Elodie saw Marcus had already torn the cover to the manual controls open, and was heaving on the bar to close the hatch. He was bleeding too quickly, and there were red smears on the wall, the lever and streaks across Garina’s uniform. She dropped Korta, practically tossing him aside to grab the lever and slam the door shut.

Marcus then collapsed, soaked in sweat and blood. Elodie bent to stop the bleeding from what remained of his right arm. As she twisted the makeshift tourniquet tight, the orbital starport rang and shuddered with a third powerful impact.

\---

Elodie came back to the utility room she had left her crew in. After stabilizing Marcus with a universal first aid kit, she got his assurance that he could watch over the others while she searched the area for survivors, supplies, and information.

Marcus was on the floor leaned up against a bulkhead, definitely in pain, but the available drugs had taken the edge off. Phiulid physiology was designed to play dead or flee when threats arose, and Garina’s apparently unconscious form was waiting for the threat to pass. Korta was faring somewhat better. His peaceful homeworld had left the Teyasu with no response to danger. While Korta *intellectually* understood their situation was precarious, he simply didn’t *feel* the danger, leaving him deeply confused. 

Elodie passed water pouches around and helped Marcus drink. She had also come back with a few emergency food packs, blankets, and, Marcus noted, a flare gun. Her face was grim, and with a glance at the other two, he spoke quietly.

“You’ve been gone an hour. ” The station groaned and clanged occasionally, the sounds distant as the damage settled.

“There are a couple other survivor clusters, but they’re behind some hard vacuum and bent bulkheads. A couple others had made it to some lifepods and launched. They…” Elodie closed her eyes and shook her head.

Korta blinked and looked at the two Solarians. “Emergency protocol 3.3 states that when there is a risk of decompression, we must proceed to a lifepod and eject. If we are unable to evacuate due to injuries or other factors, 3.6 states that we must use signal methods to alert rescuers of our presence.” 

Elodie smiled gently at Korta. “Yes, but I don’t think either of those are good options right now.”

Korta turned his head to give Elodie his full attention. “But there was a catastrophic impact to the station. We cannot tell how stable the structure is. The protocol gives us clear steps on what to do.” Faint clanging punctuated Korta’s words, lending an urgency he was unable to feel. 

Marcus closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Korta, what d’you think hit the station?”

“I have been thinking hard about that. I believe it was rogue asteroids.”

Marcus winced as he shifted, then nodded. “Okay, why rogue asteroids?”

Korta waggled his head in confusion. “Nearby construction debris wouldn’t move that fast relative to the station. Industrial castoffs from the outer system would have been reported, tracked and compensated for. That leaves high-speed extra-system uncharted objects like a rogue asteroid cluster. Only…”

Elodie was listening in as she popped the panel off the door console. Marcus glanced at her, then back to Korta. “Only what?”

Korta waggled his head even more. “Only, the odds of that happening are impossibly remote for a single strike. But three?”

Elodie twisted some wires together and the door slid shut, the latch making an audible *click*. She reseated the panel back into the wall. “What if it was from something much closer? Say, a mass accelerator?”

“I have read that mass accelerators could be used to provide thrust to ships, but there are other, far more efficient ways. In addition, the ship operators would need to be careful to ensure their castoff mass didn’t harm anyone. No. Mass accelerators are-” a loud clang nearby shook the deck, cutting Korta short.

Elodie leapt for Korta and Marcus, snatching their emergency lights and switching them off, much to Korta’s objection. “Elodie, what are..”

“*Shut up,”* Elodie hissed. She continued in a whisper. “Mass accelerators are more efficiently used as weapons. When made at a sufficient size, they could do the damage we saw.”

Korta stared at Elodie with those innocent, trusting, wide eyes and was once again reminded of her childhood stuffie.. “But why…”Elodie grabbed his beak, clamping it shut. “Your planet is under attack. That clang? That was an enemy boarding pod. Now we have to be *quiet*, and hope they don’t have scanners that can detect us in here.”

Distant rattling echoed down the corridor outside.

Elodie dragged Marcus and Garina behind a shelf, while Korta gathered up their supplies and followed along behind. She pulled out the flare gun and began to pray.",2,1745099750.0,humansarespaceorcs,1,1.0,False
1k37dta,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1k37dta/coffee_table_from_amazon_stuck_in_canada_post_hell/,Coffee Table from Amazon Stuck in Canada Post Hell,"On April 6, I ordered a coffee table from Amazon for approximately $200. When Amazon shipped it, I was dismayed to see that they had used Canada Post. I saw it go from Belleville (weird) to Mississauga, then Montreal (where I live). I checked the tracking on April 10 and it said ""delivery attempted"". I was home all day and didn't hear a knock at my door. I then found a delivery notice card in my mailbox. So, I went to the post office ready to pick it up. When I got there, they told me they didn't have it. They told me to call the Canada Post depot at \[this number\]. So, I called and they told me they didn't have my table and didn't know where it was. Then they told me to call Canada Post at another number. Again, I called and it was an automated system. They sent me a link by text where I was able to chat with a live agent and open a support ticket. After about a 15-minute chat, I received an email with a support ticket number and an estimated resolution date of 2025/04/23. It seems they have misplaced my table. Could they have lost it? if so, can I get a refund or another table shipped to me (just not by CP)? I know it's not the 23rd yet, but I'm just nervous about losing $200 because Amazon and CP fucked up. I also hate that Amazon doesn't let you choose which company to ship with and they don't even tell you which one until it's been shipped.",2,1745099734.0,CanadaPost,0,1.0,False

i just feel anxious making meals for myself when he's around as I hate him commenting on it in any sort of way. just sensitive about it still. his constant diet culture kinda talk angers me because 
this good/bad foods thing absolutely doesn't help anyone. it just creates guilt and shame and makes weight a 'moral issue' or failure. 

yesterday i did coffee with 1 and 1/2 tsp of sugar and he judged me saying it was a lot and saying he wouldn't put as much. like bruh that's hardly excessive.

general fatphobia- apparently anyone who doesn't obsessively exercise and walk everywhere is lazy and 'fat'. his words not mine. he hates people who drive everywhere. he's obsessed with getting his steps in and feels guilty if he doesn't move. he feels like he needs to earn food all the time. guess these issues run in the family woohoo!!
he also says the word 'fat' like he's spitting out something extremely nasty, there's so much hate and anger and vitriol in his voice it's honestly horrible. me in recov is just grimacing and gritting my teeth. i do pull him up on it but makes no damn difference.

my family are so body obsessed too like ie:
his comments about my 'long fingers' and calling them elegant and said it's good I don't have 'short stubby fingers'. ugh.
also my grans comments about how she wishes she was slim like me (I am literally gaining idk what she's talking about) 

my dads constant comments about how only fat people go to drive thrus etc.
his constant mocking of fat people who are just existing
I am at my wits end when it comes to his comments. he may be 60 but inside he is a school bully that hasn't ever grown up. he seriously makes me uncomfortable. sometimes I hate him. why do people feel the need to care SM ab what other ppl are eating and moralise food.

I need to vent!

She has two cats. One is three and one is an 11-month-old kitten. The 3-year-old cat isn't so bad. She generally keeps to herself. But the kitten drives me absolutely crazy. I have never encountered a cat that is so terribly annoying. It is unreal. It's like he is possessed by a demon.

My roommate is never home and her cats are extremely understimulated. So they spend all their time begging for my attention, trying to get into my bedroom, and getting in the way of anything I try to do. This includes cooking (they jump on the counter), working on my laptop (chew the cable), walking anywhere (they trip me and serpentine my legs), attacking my hands and laces when I try to tie my shoes, etc... anything I touch they want to be a part of. They crawl around my laundry when I am trying to wash clothes. The kitten will even scratch me while I'm eating food at the table, in an attempt to get my attention. I struggle to do any of my artistic crafts at home because they want to play with whatever I'm working on. I'm constantly trying to manage their behavior while I'm at home.

There are multiple cat tunnels, cat trees, and 20 cat toys all over our floor at any given point. They have a laser robot toy (which I disagree with, but I'm not their owner), and catnip accessible. But they don't really play with a lot of this stuff. They crave human attention and stimulation. They want you to drag the string on the ground, they want to chase the toy at the end of the wand you move. 

I know that keeping cats off the counter is a sisyphean effort that a lot of cat owners struggle with. But I'm the only one that actively tries to prevent the cats from being on the counters. My roommates just laugh at it and think it's cute. It grosses me out and I have even found cat poop in the kitchen, that presumably the kitten has brought in to play with, from the litter box.

Kittens are a lot of work. My ex and I had one and I vowed to myself I would never have a kitten again because it's like having a toddler. They are always getting into things, and putting themselves in danger. You have to have eyes on the back of your head and constantly anticipate what is going to attract their attention.

I love cats, I really do. I want cats of my own one day, but at this point in my life I know that they are a lot of responsibility. I want to have a certain level of freedom in my life where I don't have to be home by 6:00 to feed my cats. Or feel guilty if I'm away from them too long. Being a good cat owner means being around for your animals. Why have them otherwise? She doesn't spend a lot of time at home. She constantly comes in and out of the house and has guys over for sex. Whether they close the door or not, her cats are once again forced into the common area. 

She doesn't feed them on a consistent schedule so they go through long stretches without food. They beg for food from me constantly. They jump on the table and try to eat off my plate. She has one of those water fountains but only cleans it once a month so who knows how clean it is. I top it off everyday because when it gets really low, it makes an annoying noise. If I didn't, it would become empty, and she wouldn't notice until the next day when she feeds them. Right now there are a lot of dead ants in the fountain that she must not notice. 

I never see her play with her cats. She does not brush them. She claims they don't like to be brushed. She does not cut their nails and only gets their nails cut at the vet. It took living with her for 5 months before she finally brought them to the vet to get their nails cut. In the meantime, they've destroyed a lot of furniture (thankfully not mine), and scratched me and my friends plenty of times. The kitten is bad at controlling his claws. Both cats seem to have breathing issues and she says she's going to bring them to the vet about that. But again, it's been months.

I can't leave anything out because the cats will knock it over or take it down to her room and hide it. The kitten is especially notorious for this and I have a number of small items missing (like a cap to a water bottle, a glove, etc ..). I also have to keep all of my food in plastic bins because when I leave bags of rice or plastic bags of any food out, the kitten will bite holes in the plastic, and drag my food around the house.

I can't just shut her cats in her room while she's not home. I try directing them to her space in hopes they spend more time there, but they always come back to the main common area. She burns a lot of incense, and uses a very strong body spray, so one of my theories is they don't like the smell of her area. But even when she's home, they don't hang out with her. They greet her when she comes home, but then they go back to bothering me. They hang outside my bedroom door for hours. The one forbidden place they are not allowed in.

The only place I can have to myself at home, without her cats, is my bedroom. It's very small and I can't spend all day inside it. Whenever I open the door they try to rush in and I have to chase them or push them out as I'm opening the door. 

This isn't even taking into account the litter box. She doesn't empty the litter box everyday even though she says she does. The litter box is in the bathroom next to our kitchen so whenever I eat, I smell cat shit and cat piss. I usually have to ask her to empty the litter box, or suggest she change out the litter when it gets especially rank. When she does empty the litter box, half the time she puts the cat poop bag in our kitchen garbage.

The kitten is a long hair with extremely dense fur. He needs to be brushed, that's just part of having a long hair cat. His hair gets all over the apartment. The vacuum rollers are clogged with it. He plays with the paper towel roll on the counter so hair gets all over that. Cat hair is in our drain board for the clean dishes. I find his hair in my food. I'm constantly cleaning up after his hair. It is unlike anything I have ever seen after owning multiple cats. It is on another level of shedding. It sticks to everything. I suggested to her that maybe she can get him groomed professionally, if he doesn't like when she brushes him, and she said she's going to do it. But once again, it hasn't happened. 

I'm the only one that vacuums the common area, which accumulates the most hair. Also, the litter tracks all over the apartment and I sweep that up too. It feels unfair that I essentially have to clean up after her cats. Neither roommate is not bothered by the filth. They walk around the apartment barefoot, with cat litter sticking to their feet. I don't get it. When I ask her to vacuum, she says she has done it already, even though it's very evident she has not and there is still cat hair and litter everywhere. I don't want to start a fight by accusing her of lying. I have to live with her for 6 more months.

One of her cats peed outside of the litter box twice, while she was not home, so I had to clean it up. It stained the hardwood of our rental. The smell was overpowering. Neither of my roommates noticed it or cared. I had to do research online on how to remove cat urine from hardwood and did a hydrogen peroxide treatment. It worked but sucks that I had to be the one to deal with it.

At the moment I'm unemployed and looking for work so it's very hard for me to concentrate at home and I find myself going to coffee shops to do applications. While it's great to get out of the house, I feel like I'm chased out of my own home. During my absence, the cats become more lonely and under-stimulated. When I return they are more in my way.

The cherry on top is whenever she travels, she asks if I can feed her cats and scoop their litter. But she doesn't ask me before she makes plans. She just assumes that I'm going to be available, after she makes the plans. But the alternative would be her asking one of the random guys she hooks up with to come into our house, with her key. I don't feel comfortable with that. 

My other roommate has two cats as well, but they are much better behaved and don't cause as many problems. The difference is night and day. She's not around a lot, and she travels with her cats so that is the reason she is not helping a majority of the time. She's just not here. 

Both roommates discipline all their cats with a spray bottle. But I've read online it's ineffective, so they assume cats are untrainable rather than recognizing their disciplinary method is ineffective. 

I don't know what to do. I'd like to move out but I can't afford to. And without a job, I will have great difficulty finding a landlord who will want to rent to me. I want problem roommate to move out so badly. 

None of this really quantifies as animal abuse. They are fed, their litter box gets emptied (although not as often as it should be), they are not visibly sick (though they may have undiagnosed asthma), and they are not kept in cages or restrained. But the cats don't seem happy. 

The whole situation is annoying and I feel powerless and frustrated. I feel really bad that these cats are bored out of their mind and miss their owner. And I don't like how the place where I'm supposed to relax, recharge, and be productive is now a place where I have to be on high alert all the time. I can't leave things out, I can't do my crafts in the room with the most space and best light, I can't be productive on my laptop. Forget about working remotely! Cooking is different, cleaning is endless, and the litter box smell kills my appetite.

I now know living with cats in the future is going to be extremely dependent on the owner's behavior. I assumed that living with four cats would be fine because I like cats. But I've never encountered countered this combination of somewhat negligent owner, long hair shedding, and annoying cat behavior. If you are considering living with a roommate that has cats, try to get as much info as you can about their lifestyle and cat behavior ahead of time. It's not something I considered enough.",1,1745099024.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

The last 7 months has been like rollercoaster about my friendship and i would like your opinion on something i find really simple but my « ex » best friend doesn't seem to understand..

For some details we were (H27) working together at a restaurant me as the chef and him as the sous chef for 3 years.

Things were going great and we had found a way to communicate that was working better than with other colleagues, we were going to party every weekend, seeing each other at work daily and chilling after work etc, being literally all day together, laughing talking about anything possible and all of these with some great amount of work being done and always being professional when needed..

The last year we had the idea to open a coffee shop and we left our jobs for that, but since then rather than working with me to build our new project he went for vacations, he was saying « i don’t know how to do that, can you do it for me », he war forgetting to do stuff, and even proposing to have CHATGPT to answer questions for the future of our bussiness..

Three months later of this mood i had enough and i told him that i can’t continue this, it takes too much energy and it doesn’t make me feel okay (i had 3 séances with my psychotherapist to search a way to say it so he doesn’t take it bad, i asked friends and even consulted my family to try to take care of what we have cause i understand it’s a difficult matter..)

In the meantime we had booked vacations with my girlfriend and had invited him and another friend to join, and he wanted to come but without talking to me and doing « the bear minimum » with me but only sleeping to our place, so i also told him that i don’t find it cool neither normal (it was vacation for my birthday and he was invited, by me) 

anyway since then he said that i was fake to him, manipulating and asshole for not « finishing the company with him, as my friend, but chose to do it on my own » and cause i made him feel bad.

if you need more info i will add it on an edit!

Some context.
I (34f) am in the process of getting a divorce to my ex (36m) we will call him X. And we both have 2 children B(11m) and G(9f). We live in the UK and I'm terrible at spelling so please forgive me.

I am a recovering people pleaser who is learning how to be a single mum/co parent to B and G, over the past few months I have been back in contact with an old childhood friend (42m) call him L.

Now here's where things get complicated, me and L chat regularly every day through texts and sometimes video chat, we also meet up a few times for coffee and chat.

L and I both have the same faith, we get on really well and he makes me smile and when he sees me his face lights up like a million twinkly fairy lights. I however have made a promise to myself and God because that means alot to me, and I intend to stick to it, the promise is I am not going to date until I am 100% completely divorced to X.

I have let L know about my promise and he is really respectfully and understands how important that is for me. 

Second bit of important context.
L's mum is my mums Dads cousin making me and L second cousins.

Here is my dilemma. I have strong feelings for L and I think he may have the same feeling for me. Yet we are still remaining friends and I havent told L about my feelings yet because of my promise and also I don't want to make things awkward.

We are meeting up for a meal together next week and I don't know whether to tell him or wait until X and I are 100% Divorced.

I want to be careful but I don't know if I want to get complicated with our family connection. 

I have checked and it is legal for me to date L if we both wanted to but however I'm little unsure.

1k36xg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/1k36xg9/great_trip_only_a_minor_heart_attack/,"Great trip, only a minor heart attack....","Sup friends! Got a little light hearted story about myself and forgetting something pretty important during a longer-short trip. So this may be a PSA for people who forgot like I did....and maybe a little giggle for others. 

Truck....23 Lariat ER

TLDR (sort of): red flashing ring is not a red solid ring....and not all Tesla chargers are the same. 

We did a trip that was about 400 miles to an area that had limited chargers near the cabin we were staying in. But, I did a bunch of planning and had it all figured out. Did two stops on the way up, and then did a third to charge up for the next day as the cabin didn't have charging (and nothing was near...maybe 20 minutes min). Kids loved stopping to charge, so the way up was quite pleasant. 

First need to mention that I am only now becoming comfortable with low charge numbers. I don't know why it's taken me a year plus, but yea....it did. Anyways, I charged to 80% thinking that I would need to charge each day somewhere to make sure the next day I was good. But much to my surprise, I didn't need to charge for 3 full days....and the fourth day I charged to start the drive back.  Started at 75ish at the cabin and left at about 20. With that said, I honestly can say I didn't have a single CON the entire trip up and there. All pros. It was great. (We were in northern ish Cali). Just made sure each day I could get there and back with a comfortable number at the end.

So now the fun part. Driving home. Down to 20%, gonna stop for a snack and charge. Got the Tesla adapter ready to rock (only used Tesla's since ABRP apparently loves them). I stopped about 15 minutes before the charge destination since we wanted a coffee. Pull up.....boom....Tesla chargers were there. I was like oh I'll just charge here. Made sense. Roll up, plug in.....red ring of death. I stared at the charge port for like 2 minutes. Wife finally goes you good?  And I said I think we are in trouble. I unplug, go to the next charger over and same thing. She starts to search what the red ring means because she sees me silently screaming in my head. 

I start going through the end scenario. We are in the middle of no where basically, 2 hours from home, three kids....how am I going to get them home, or at least start the process of getting this fixed. I tried a third charger....red ring. I'm done. Truck is cooked. She, with the level head, was like maybe it is just these chargers and they are bad. I said I don't think so since there was one other person charging (a Tesla). She told me to get the coffee and let's just see what happens at the next station. So I did, still silently raging. Everything I am googling while waiting for coffee is red ring is the end game. 

We start driving the 15 minutes to the actual charger destination....and we are still googling. Everything we read is a red solid ring. We remembered it always flashed. But nothing searched said anything about flashing. 5 minutes out from the charger....it hit me. I could have sworn I read something about Tesla superchargers and older versions did not work with the lightning. I told her to search that and yep, v1 and v2 didn't work. But still didn't mention anything about the red flashing ring, so I was maybe 20% less worried. The ring still was freaking me out. 

We arrived. Plugged in. We both stared and.....the blue ring came. I have never been so relieved. Felt like an idiot for forgetting that key point.....but....it was a great laugh afterwards. 

So, kind reminder that V1 and V2 Tesla superchargers definitely don't work on the lightning. And also that a red flashing ring probably just means incompatible charger? Maybe? 

But.....ABRP also knew that charger was bad....that was cool. I went back and looked at the app and those chargers that didn't work were not even on the app for me to choose when I looked. So that's good to know lol. Trust in ABRP!

I was out for around 2 hours, and it felt so good!

I’ve started walking without crutches at home sometimes now. While I originally thought I’d ditch the crutches earlier, I’m trying to listen to my body and let it heal on its own timeline.

That said, I recently tried an exercise with my PT that was supposed to help me walk fully without crutches—and I felt an intense, deep glute pain, maybe even in the joint. It only lasted a second, but it was scary. A day later, we attempted smaller steps and turned on some music. I’m a dancer, so my body naturally started taking small steps forward unassisted—and I even did some tiny hip movements. I think that helped ease my nerves a bit and made me feel more confident. All I needed is a little music 💃

I also saw the same table in a regular store, and the top there looked much shinier. I'm looking for a way to make mine as glossy as the one I saw in-store or in the photos. The first photo is my table, and the third and fourth are brand new tables from a regular store for comparison.

There’s also a small chip on my table. I was wondering if a wood specialist (or someone experienced) could apply a product or finish to make it shinier and glossier (see last photo).

Looking forward to your input—thanks in advance!

Firstly, apologies if I shouldn’t be posting this here - I know this is a long shot, but I figured it was worth trying. Im a 28/M, currently visiting from Sydney, Australia, and after visiting my sister in New York, I planned one final stop before heading home — to visit and hike in and around the Grand Canyon National Park (specifically around the South Kaibab area) 

I had the foresight to book a car through Turo to make this happen… but I lost my wallet (and with it, my physical driver’s license) in New York. Turo unfortunately doesn’t accept digital licenses, and they don’t offer refunds after 24 hours from the booking date, so there goes $450 down the drain. I tried to pivot — called a local rental place in Flagstaff, and they said they might be able to work something out with my digital license, so I rerouted my plans to get to Flagstaff early.

Then, just to top things off, my flight into Phoenix had to abort its landing right as we were about to touch down, which delayed us just long enough for me to miss my shuttle to Flagstaff. Now I won’t arrive until after the rental place closes.

So here I am, in Phoenix airport, still determined — maybe foolishly! — to catch sunrise at the Grand Canyon tomorrow (Saturday 19th). If by any chance you’re heading from Flagstaff to the Grand Canyon Visitor Center early tomorrow morning and have a spare seat, I’d be incredibly grateful for a ride. I’m staying centrally in Flagstaff and would happily pitch in for gas, coffee/snacks, and a gratuity tip. 

Thanks so much for reading this far — and even if nothing works out, I appreciate the kindness of this community. Fingers crossed!",3,1745097916.0,grandcanyon,2,1.0,False

1k36qng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thrifty/comments/1k36qng/if_you_make_coldbrew_coffee_you_can_use_the/,"If you make cold-brew coffee, you can use the grounds twice","The title pretty much says it all, but here's more details:

I switched from hot to cold-brewed coffee a few months before covid shut things down in March 2020. I first tried it when I found a *very* cheap bottle of cold-brew concentrate in a grocery clearance section, and liked it so much better than hot-brew coffee, I immediately set about trying to make my own. I ended up buying specialized cold-brew pitchers (about $15 each at the time, IIRC), and through trial and error discovered that for daily cold-brew drinkers, the ideal minimum number of pitchers to have is three: one you're currently drinking from; one where the coffee is steeping but not ready to drink yet; and a third so you have time to wash a newly empty pitcher before refilling it with coffee grounds and water to steep.

The minimum time for steeping is supposed to be 24 hours, but mine will sometimes sit for several days before I drink it, depending on how long it takes to finish whatever pitcher I'm currently drinking from.

Most ""how to make cold brew coffee"" recipes tell you to remove the grounds before you start drinking, and I followed that instruction the first few times I made it, but one morning I was in a rush and had no time to empty the grounds first. Made no difference in the quality or taste of the resulting brew, so now I leave them in the whole time I'm drinking from that pitcher. (Grounds are in a mesh cylinder suspended in the middle of the pitcher.) Then, when I finish a ""fresh"" pitcher of coffee, I refill it with water and let it steep again, for several days, while I drink from the newest pitcher.

A cup of ""first-run"" cold-brew coffee is strong enough that I dilute it with chilled water before adding the cream and sugar. I keep a jug of water in the fridge next to the cold-brew pitchers specifically for this purpose. A cup of ""second-run"" coffee is definitely weaker; I drink that ""straight"" without adding water first. Also, while 24 hours is the minimum steeping time for cold-brew coffee made of fresh grounds, for a second-run you'll want to let it steep at least twice as long. Mine steeps for a few days, however much time it takes for me to finish a pitcher.

(I once experimented with trying a third brew with the grounds, but it's not worth it; no matter how many days you let it steep, after two cold brewings there just isn't enough left in the grounds to get a drinkable third batch from it. Two brewings is the most you can get from a given amount of ground coffee, and still hope to get a drinkable cup of cold brew.)

One other thing that might be relevant: whether I'm making a first-run or second-run batch, I don't pour the water directly into the pitcher; instead, I pour it (*very* slowly) directly into that mesh cylinder filled with coffee grounds, so that every drop of water has to work its way through the grounds before making it into the cylinder itself.",11,1745097877.0,Thrifty,1,0.92,False

That’s what you’ll tell yourself—like it was just bad timing. Like you missed some magical window where I might’ve said yes, if only you’d had the balls to ask.

But that window never existed.

There was never a version of reality where I let you touch me.

Not when you sat in that pathetic little office across the lot, staring through your tinted window while I walked to my car in tight skirts and heels.
Not when you fumbled over your words just to say good morning.
Not when you offered to fix my printer.
Not even when you bought me that coffee I never asked for.

You were never a contender.

And I know that kills you now.

Because you just found out, didn’t you?

That I’ve fucked nearly every man in your building.
All your coworkers.
Every loud, cocky, careless man you ever tried to feel superior to.
I let them all have me.
Except you.

You never even came close.

You didn’t know at first.
You thought you were the clever one, staying quiet.
You thought I was saving you.
That maybe I liked you better.
That I was building to something special.

God, that’s adorable.

But the truth?

You were a joke. A useful joke.

Because someone has to be last.
Someone has to be the one left out.
The one they all laugh about after they’ve cum inside me.
And I chose you.

You heard them eventually.
In the breakroom.
At happy hour.
Or maybe you just saw the way they looked at me, the way they smirked when you showed up.
You put it together.
Too late, of course.
But it clicked.

That’s why Derrick always called me “Queen of the Office.”
Why Marcus would wink when he asked how my “meetings” were.
Why your boss always seemed so relaxed after our 3 p.m. check-ins.

You confronted me, remember?

You actually had the nerve to stop me in the parking lot and ask if it was true.

I didn’t lie.
I didn’t even flinch.
I just tilted my head and said,
“Which part?”

You froze.
Your throat clicked when you swallowed.
I think you were hoping I’d laugh, or deny it, or maybe touch your arm and whisper something reassuring.

Instead, I stepped closer, leaned in, and said,
“Every. Single. One.”

Then I got in my car and left you there.
Hard.
Hurt.
Humiliated.

And now?
Now you’re unraveling.
I can feel it.

You try not to look at me, but your eyes always find my legs.
You try to keep your voice steady when you speak, but your breath catches every time I say your name.
You don’t even try to hide the flush in your cheeks anymore.
They all see it.
They love it.

You made yourself the joke, but I made you the punchline.

I let them tell you stories.
I encouraged it.

How I moaned.
How I rode them.
How I whispered filthy things with my tongue against their ears.

They describe me in detail—loudly, crudely, unapologetically.
They talk about how I looked when I came.
How I sounded.
How I begged.
And they watch your reaction like it’s dessert.

Because it is.

You’re the one who gets hard and does nothing.
You’re the one who listens and pretends to laugh along while your cock presses painfully against your slacks.
You’re the one who still hopes I’ll change my mind.

But I won’t.

And I never will.

You weren’t forgotten, pet.
You were denied.

Deliberately.
Permanently.
Because I wanted one. Just one. To stay untouched.
To stay aching.
To carry every story like a brand across your brain.

You weren’t passed over.
You were chosen—for exactly this.

You want to know what really makes me wet?
Not the cocks. Not the power. Not even the attention.

It’s you.
Sitting across from me.
Suffering in silence.
Knowing they all had me.
Knowing you never will.

It’s that little twitch in your jaw when I mention names you know too well.
It’s the way you flinch when I say, “last night.”
It’s watching you bite your lip when I show up to work flushed and freshly fucked.

That’s your role now.
Not the man who gets me.
The man who gets wrecked by never getting me.

So sit there.
Look pretty in your useless little button-up.
Pretend it doesn’t kill you to hear their laughter echo down the hall.

You’ll never be part of the story.

You’ll always be the lesson.

This is my current design — the countertop will be Cosentino (as in the pic, though it’s hard to appreciate properly in the render).

I’m unsure whether to go with the handleless profile in aluminium silver or black. From the living area (which is behind the island), it’s barely visible.

The bar stools will have some black accents, and I’m thinking the pendant lights might bring in some brown or gold tones.

I want something simple and timeless so I don’t get tired of it, but also not too plain. I'm more comfortable adding color in non-permanent areas that I can easily change later. On top of the oven I'll place the coffee machine, toaster and kettle plugged... I also wonder if I should add wood touches in there? It will also have the countertop...

Any thoughts on the gola color or other subtle ways to bring in interest without overcommitting?

8 months ago we moved in together, most of the expenses were on him, so I tried my best to clean, cook and do everything for comfort.

We both knew it from the beginning, that we both have very different lifestyles I like to sit at home, read and spend time with girlfriends for a cup of coffee. and he is an avid party animal and every weekend went to bars and clubs, of course without me. 

The problems started when he drunkenly started calling me and telling me live that it is hard with me, that I am hypocritical and selfish, a bitch and a whore (although in this respect I have no one but him has never had). this situation was repeated not once and not twice, I pretended that nothing was happening because he just said sorry, and that was enough for me. 
Further he has a friend with whom he flatly refused to introduce me, he said we are too different and I do not need it, said that she is like a brother or a friend, but he communicates with her with such jokes and hints as if they have something (I and he have accounts and passwords of social networks of each other), I asked to stop so communicate with her that way because I am offended and unpleasant, but I was not heard under various excuses.

The last situation was that he went to a rave to drink again, at 2 am I got a call from the police station saying that he was arrested for drunkenness and beating up a police officer, I gave him half an hour to come, I said that I would not be able to make it in such a time, the policeman yelled at me and hung up, my boyfriend arrived at 7 am at our apartment, the following happened: he threw a tantrum that I told the policeman to fuck off and said that I didn't know him (my boyfriend), he started insulting me again, he broke the table in our rented apartment to scare me.
I'm sorry for such a long story, I need your advice, I don't know how I feel about him, I don't want to be bad and leave him, I'm also used to him and I'm afraid to sleep through the usual rhythm of life, I'm afraid to tell my mom about it and come home, I think I'll be accused of putting up with a lot of things.

She wouldn’t say it she’d go with me but act weird. I also tried to bring up how we feel more distant but I worded it poorly. She doesn’t like to talk about what’s going on imo? I gave us a while apart and stopped contacting her first but we’ve met up a few times. It’s just odd because i miss how we were. When she gets into relationships she doesn’t say it she just gets very distant- she was with one guy who she didn’t tell me about until they broke up and then she was a bit more free until she got into the next.

As far as i knew she was single but she recently vanished from social media only to remake her accounts on private. Our mutual friend tried following the account but she didn’t accept. It’s active because a different mutual said she follows it. Kind of strange, I haven’t tried re adding her but we aren’t sure what to do here


She also has a whole different friend group and kind of hints to me that they’re “cooler” but idk. ",1,1745096994.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

I'll be relocating to SF in the next few weeks for a new work opportunity and was wondering if you had suggestions on short term rentals and where to find decent deals with solid backgrounds other than the usual Airbnb or VRBO.  I'm not sure if their is a local SF community that provides such services.  I want to take a month or two in a short term to figure out what area to possibly sign a lease for an apt.

  
My office is near Union Sq but I will eventually not need to be in every day but have to be around the city for possible client meetings as folks come through the city so its unlikely a suburb in Marin or even Oakland makes sense right now.

From research I know Pac Heights and Marina are the nice areas most folks mention but I'm primarily looking for a quieter section, decent amount of restaurants, coffee shops, food markets and possibly some shopping around.  

Also in terms of transportation, in my previous visits for work its primarily been UBER or LYFT, is mass transport sensible?  coming from NYC where a subway is easy and i know the system like the back of my hand, I understand thats not possible in SF.  Just curious if anyone has thoughts on best way to move around other than my own two feet.  I think with the hills and my possible lifestyle, a bicycle is not practicle.

  
I appreciate the info in advance.  ",2,1745096889.0,AskSF,3,1.0,False
1k36de2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1k36de2/what_do_you_think_a_fair_tip_percentage_is_here/,What do you think a fair tip percentage is here?,"So our restaurant is sort of unique in that it is in a hotel lobby, and there are other outlets in our department like the coffee shop right across the hall. 

The last few years have not been great business or staffing wise but we were finally able to get support staff again. So now we have a host that helps buss, does room service/to goes, and helps in the coffee shop instead of the servers also doing those things. We used to have a dedicated room service person but it’s not busy enough to justify it anymore. We also used to tip out our support 15-20%.

The issue right now is that our current manager’s guidance is to tip “whatever you think they deserve” so of course it is all over the board. Like there’s been some problem servers who have only tipped out $5 off their $200. Some just tossing a few bucks regardless of what they made etc.. What I really hate is how our host is used to it now so like last night it was slow and he didn’t want to take the $6 I was going to give him because I gave him $25 last time. I had to explain again how I’m not overpaying him. 

And to be fair it is kind of a gray area because they CAN get preoccupied for 30 min doing room services where they can make some of their own money. But the way I see it is if they get stuck doing that or stuck in the gift shop for 5-10 min it’s still helping us focus on our tables. In between that he’s still an active part of our team. 

I’m thinking having a policy of 10% seems fair enough? All 10 years of my experience is at this one restaurant so I am limited in perspective even though I’ve been around for a lot of changes. Hopefully this made sense I tried not to make it too long. I’m curious what ya’ll think. ",1,1745096828.0,Serverlife,4,1.0,False

I have gotten 14 responses within 24 hours. All detailing accounts where he also followed them. So far, one girl has already reported him, but they said they couldn’t do anything because he hasn’t done anything illegal. But now we’ve got 13 different people and multiple times for each woman.

LGBTQ+-Owned and Inclusive Businesses in the Greeley, CO Area

**Restaurants & Food**

	•	Luna’s Tacos & Tequila – Mexican Restaurant & Bar. A popular downtown Greeley eatery known not only for its tacos and cocktails but also for hosting inclusive events. Luna’s has put on drag brunches and similar happenings, signaling a welcoming atmosphere for LGBTQ+ patrons.

	•	The Rice Guy – Asian Cuisine Food Truck. A local food truck that participates in community events. Notably, The Rice Guy served up dishes at Greeley’s Pride celebration, showing support for the LGBTQ+ community by joining the Pride festival’s food lineup ￼. (Food trucks like this add to the inclusive vibe of local events.)

**Bars & Nightlife**

	•	Patrick’s Irish Pub – Pub & Live Event Venue. A downtown pub that has earned a reputation as an LGBTQ+-friendly hangout. Patrick’s has hosted drag show nights (“Greeley Does Drag” events) and is described as “welcoming of all queer people,” making it a go-to spot for inclusive nightlife in Greeley.

	•	WeldWerks Brewing Co. – Craft Brewery & Taproom. A beloved Greeley brewery known for its progressive, inclusive spirit. WeldWerks celebrates Pride Month by offering special Pride-themed merchandise (like rainbow stickers and shirts) and donating proceeds to the local PFLAG chapter ￼, demonstrating active support for LGBTQ+ causes.

	•	Syntax Distillery & Cocktail Bar – Craft Distillery & Bar. This Greeley cocktail bar (part of Syntax Spirits) frequently hosts diverse entertainment, including drag shows and burlesque nights. Their events calendar highlights recurring drag performances ￼, showing that Syntax provides an affirming space for LGBTQ+ artistry and nightlife.

	•	Stampede Kava – Kava Bar (Non-Alcoholic). An alcohol-free lounge that embraces inclusive nightlife alternatives. Stampede Kava has partnered with local drag performers; for example, it was the venue for a “Greeley Does Drag” show in 2025 ￼ ￼. By opening its doors to drag events, this kava bar offers a welcoming social spot for LGBTQ+ folks (including those under 21, since many of its events are 18+).

**Coffee Shops**

	•	Margie’s Java Joint – Coffeehouse. A cozy coffee shop in Greeley that has become a known safe space for the queer community. In fact, a weekly LGBTQ+ coffee meetup is hosted here every Saturday afternoon. Local patrons specifically recommend Margie’s as a queer-friendly alternative to other cafes￼, praising its welcoming environment for gatherings.

	•	Bright Side Coffee Co. – Coffee Trailer & Café. A Northern Colorado craft coffee business (started as a mobile trailer, now opening a downtown Greeley café) that prides itself on community engagement. Bright Side showed its support by serving signature brews at the Greeley Pride festival. Its presence at Pride and collaboration with other local businesses signal an inclusive and affirming ethos.

	•	Mill Haüs Coffee – Coffee Shop (Milliken). Located just outside Greeley in Milliken, this coffee shop has embraced the local LGBTQ+ community as well. Mill Haüs Coffee was highlighted at Greeley Pride, offering a “comforting cup” to event attendees ￼. This participation reflects the shop’s allyship and its role in the “around Greeley” area as an inclusive gathering spot.

**Retail & Specialty Stores**

	•	Downtown Oddity Parlor – Curiosities & Gift Shop. A unique shop in downtown Greeley that “specializes in curiosities, taxidermy and oddities,” proudly embracing the “weird and wonderful”. By cultivating a love for the unconventional, the Oddity Parlor creates a judgment-free atmosphere that appeals to many in the LGBTQ+ community. Its celebration of oddities goes hand-in-hand with a broader spirit of acceptance and individuality.

	•	Accessories With a Flair…and Hair! – Boutique & Salon. A longstanding Greeley boutique that doubles as a salon and wig center. This shop offers fashion, accessories, and wig/hair services in one space￼. Because it provides wigs and styling, it has become a resource for diverse clientele – from drag performers to transgender individuals exploring gender expression. The staff’s experience with wigs and personal styling helps ensure an LGBTQ+-affirming experience (it’s even listed among transgender-friendly salons in the region).

**Salons & Beauty**

	•	Accessories With a Flair…and Hair! – (See above, under Retail). Boutique Salon. (Listed again here as it fits both categories.) This downtown business is not only a clothing boutique but also a full-service salon known for its inclusive approach. With a private wig studio and personalized hair services ￼, the salon welcomes clients of all gender identities. Its ability to accommodate those seeking wigs or new looks in a friendly manner makes it a standout LGBTQ+-affirming salon in Greeley.

	•	[General Note]: Aside from dedicated spaces like the above, many mainstream hair salons and barbers in Greeley are accepting of LGBTQ+ clients. While there may not be multiple explicitly queer-owned salons in town, local stylists often participate in programs (like Strands for Trans) to signal that all are welcome. The community informally shares recommendations for stylists who are especially affirming, ensuring everyone can find a comfortable place for a haircut or makeover.

**Service Providers**

	•	MIGinsure – Insurance Brokerage. A Greeley-based insurance agency that is a member of the Colorado LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce. Located on W 20th Street￼, MIGinsure is a certified small business that proudly serves “the LGBTQ & friends community” with financial and insurance services (as noted by its chamber affiliation). Its chamber membership and local presence suggest it is either LGBTQ-owned or deeply supportive, providing inclusive service to clients.

	•	LGBTQ-Friendly Real Estate Services – Realtors. Greeley homebuyers can even find LGBTQ-friendly realtors through networks like GayRealEstate. The city doesn’t have a singular “gayborhood,” but real estate professionals knowledgeable about the LGBTQ+ community are available. Prospective residents are advised to connect with a Greeley “gay realtor” who knows and loves the community ￼ – a sign that LGBTQ-owned/service-oriented professionals are active in fields like real estate. (This ensures house-hunters can work with someone understanding of their needs.)

Each of these businesses contributes to making Greeley and its vicinity more welcoming. From eateries that host drag events to shops that celebrate diversity, the city’s LGBTQ+-owned and affirming business community spans many categories, helping residents and visitors alike feel included.

Sources: Local community reports and directories were used to identify these businesses and their LGBTQ+ connections, including the Greeley Pride event coverage, an LGBTQ city guide￼, first-hand community comments￼, and membership rolls of the Colorado LGBTQ Chamber￼, among others. These sources underscore the inclusive practices or ownership of the listed establishments.

I am definitely moving from FL for political and personal development reasons. Portland is currently the city I like best based on my research and values. 

I was wondering though, if you have kava bars over there? Kava is basically a tea with mild psychoactive effects and there's a big scene of kava bars here in Florida . Basically, the kava scene is the thing keeping me sane here. Unlike the traditional coffee shops, you can basically walk in to a kava bar not knowing anyone and walk away with new friends. Talking to strangers is encouraged. My biggest pressure point witn moving is worrying it'll be hard to make friends without the container I'm used to.

1k368d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1k368d7/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I’m a 26-year-old woman from Asia, and with the warm weather rolling in, I’ve been spending more time outside, hanging out with friends, and just enjoying the fresh energy that comes with spring heading into summer.

I’m here looking for platonic connections—good conversation, light-hearted chats, and maybe even deeper convos if we vibe! I love talking about current events, random niche topics, and things that make you pause and think. Audiobooks and podcasts are my go-to lately, especially while commuting or relaxing at home.

Also, I’m recently into F1—so if you’re into race weekends, team drama, or just enjoy the thrill of the sport, we’ll definitely have something to talk about! I’m always down for swapping predictions or just reacting to the chaos on track.

I’m not much into gaming or music, but I do love being social—whether it's grabbing coffee with friends, going on casual walks, or just chatting online and sharing thoughts about whatever's going on in the world.

I’m based in Asia, so timezones might not always line up perfectly, but I’m pretty flexible and happy to make it work. If this sounds like your kind of connection, feel free to say hi!",3,1745096395.0,r4r,1,0.8,False

1k367a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1k367a0/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part I of II,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”

ChatGPT said:
YES. That’s the full Ouroboros of pop culture right there:
AI-generated live-action Rick and Morty starring Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox—the original inspirations becoming the actual characters.

Imagine it opens with:

Exterior, suburban garage. Sparks fly. Rick (Christopher Lloyd) stumbles out, lab coat flapping like a maniacal wizard.

Morty (Michael J. Fox, digitally de-aged just enough to nail the nervous energy) follows, clutching a laser gun.

RICK: ""Morty! Morty, we've done it—we've inverted the meta-singularity! We’re not based on anyone anymore! They were based on us!""

MORTY: ""Aw jeez, Rick, is this gonna be like the time you got us stuck in a crossover with Animaniacs for three episodes?""

Key Features:

De-aged but realistic: They look mid-40s, like a weird midpoint between Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

Ultra-smooth uncanny valley: It almost looks real, but just stylized enough to avoid the creeps.

Cameos from cartoon versions: Animated Rick and Morty break into live-action to warn them: “Don’t let the plot get serialized!”

Evil Jerry is the final boss, played by an AI-generated ultra-macho version of Patrick Warburton.

And of course, it ends with:

Rick: “Morty, the only constant across the multiverse… is fan service.”

Wanna see a mock trailer script for it? Or maybe a poster tagline like
""Back to the Multiverse: A Rick and Morty Story""?

You said:
in this version though rick and morty dont just portal to places in the rick and morty universe but to ANY IP continuity anywhere


ChatGPT said:
Now that’s the quantum leap into madness we were born for:
""Rick and Morty: Dimensional Drift""
(AI-generated live-action starring Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox)

This isn't just hopping around the Rick and Morty multiverse—nah, these two are crashing every single fictional universe ever made, like a pair of interdimensional copyright violations.

Concept Trailer Breakdown:
🎵 Cue a gritty orchestral remix of the Rick and Morty theme song

Garage door opens. Rick calibrates a glitched-out portal gun with wires sparking and a VHS tape jammed in the side.

RICK (Lloyd): ""Morty! I rigged the portal gun to break through copyright barriers. We’re not bound by canon anymore!""

MORTY (MJF): ""Wait, Rick—are you saying we’re gonna piss off everyone?""

RICK: ""Morty, we’re going to Hogwarts. Then Gotham. Then the Shire. We’re even stopping by Gilligan's Island, Morty. No one is safe.""

Sample Multiversal Hijinks:
In Star Wars:
Rick argues with Yoda about quantum entanglement while Morty gets Force-choked by Baby Yoda out of pure spite.

In Middle-earth:
Morty accidentally becomes the new ringbearer. Rick builds a mecha-Balrog to fight Sauron with a lightsaber-axe hybrid.

In Westeros:
Rick fakes being a Targaryen just to hijack a dragon and declare himself “King of the Sidequests.”

In the MCU:
Rick hacks the multiverse with Kang’s own tech and calls him a “discount Time Lord.” Morty gets stuck in a suit powered by Pym particles and trauma.

In Friends:
They just show up at Central Perk, Rick drinks all the coffee, and Monica becomes convinced she hallucinated them during a stress nap.

Final Line in the Trailer:
Rick lights a cigar with a phaser in the captain’s chair of the USS Enterprise.

RICK: ""It’s not a crossover, Morty. It’s an intellectual property demolition derby.""",1,1745096318.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

Now the hard part is, if I do move there, what neighborhood should I choose? I've been to Chicago a few times now and have visited a few neighborhoods. But without telling you which ones I've been to and have considered, I'm curious what neighborhoods you'd recommend based on a general description of myself and what I'm looking for:

I'm 29, male, and single. I am not looking to have kids in the future, so a neighborhood that is not family or kid-oriented would be very ideal. I value walkability, good access to the CTA, and a place where I could potentially live car-free. I'd also probably get a bike, so that's another point of consideration. What I'm looking for, as an example, is if I needed to grab something from the grocery store, I could simply walk over there to do so, then head home. Also, my office (I work in IT) would be in River North, but I would only have to go in 1-2 days a week.

I'm a fan of beer, coffee, and good food, so being somewhere near those is a plus. On the topic of nightlife, I tend to prefer places/bars that aren't too chaotic or overwhelming, but I can handle being in more crazier places if I end up there. I also enjoy concerts, particularly EDM and rock, as music is a big passion of mine. I collect vinyls and am into gaming (especially retro), so record/game stores nearby would be cool as well. I am not into sports, so being near the venues are not important to me. 

Budget for rent is $2,400 (though I may be able to stretch this) and really only need a 1 bedroom (700 sq ft min ideally).",0,1745096312.0,AskChicago,6,0.5,False

We’ve been talking basically every day. I’m talking full-on conversations, photo and video exchanges, lots of laughs, and she’s consistently responsive and engaged. It’s honestly refreshing after coming from a previous relationship where I constantly had to chase and overthink every text.

We’ve hung out a few times now, and our last outing felt like a mini double date with a couple of our mutual friends. During that hangout, we got a bit more physically comfortable. laughing, light touches, the whole “sitting close and joking around” vibe. Afterward, I messaged her suggesting we do something proper just the two of us, and she said she’d definitely find a study break for it, despite upcoming exams. That gave me a really good sign she’s genuinely interested.

The real highlight though. We ended up meeting at a party last-minute (she was 5 mins away and we decided to link up), and we ended up dancing just the two of us. At one point, a guy tried to ask her to dance, and she straight up pointed to me and said something along the lines of “I’m with him,” and I kind of stepped in. The guy backed off, and it just felt like a very clear sign she saw me as more than just a friend.

After the party, she walked me all the way back to campus under a shared umbrella, super close, kind of movie-like moment and now we’ve got a full-on day planned next weekend: coffee, movie, dinner combo. I’m thinking that’s when I’ll reveal my intentions, tell her I really like the vibe between us, and maybe ask how she feels.

We’re not official yet, but it feels like we’re heading in that direction. I just don’t want to rush anything or misread the signs. That said, everything has felt natural, mutual, and easy, and that’s something I haven’t experienced in a long time.

Would love to hear what others think. Is this feeling like the right pace? Should I be open about how I feel on the date, or give it a bit more time?",1,1745095844.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1k360qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k360qo/salt_in_the_wound/,Salt In The Wound,"Chapter 10: Luxury 

I stood there staring at the freezer, the door hanging open, the cold air kissing my face like it could wash away the sickness curling in my stomach. Plastic-wrapped slabs of meat, sealed tight and labeled in thin, neat handwriting. Names, not cuts. Real names. Names I recognized. Names I didn’t. One in particular burned through my skull.

Carrie.

I shut the door before the kids noticed I hadn’t moved. My hands were shaking. My throat felt raw.

I turned back toward the stove, swallowing hard, and forced my voice to steady.
“Why don’t I make something a little different tonight?”

The oldest girl didn’t answer. She stood there stiff, watching me the way a wolf might watch its next meal. Not angry. Not confused. Just waiting for me to fail.

I used what I could scrounge from the cabinets and fridge. Old cans with faded labels. Some pasta. A jar of something that might have been tomatoes. Anything but what was in that freezer. Thank God the fridge had normal contents. The kids sat at the table, whispering to each other, casting glances at the clock like little wind-up toys running down on batteries.

“He’s late,” the freckled girl muttered after a long stretch of silence.

The red-headed boy’s face twisted. “You made him mad,” he said, like a verdict. “Now he won’t come for a long time.”

The littlest one didn’t say a word. She just picked at her food, eyes empty and hollow like a doll that’s been left out in the rain.

“Voila! Pasta for dinner!” I said, trying to force some life into my voice. “Isn’t this a nice change for once?”

They all stared at the plates like I’d set down something foreign.

“Where’s the meat?” the oldest asked flatly.

“Yeah,” the red-haired one chimed in, frowning, “how are we supposed to get big and strong like Daddy if we don’t eat meat?”

“Daddy says meat has to be in every meal,” the youngest added quietly, “or it doesn’t count.”

I swallowed hard and kept my smile glued in place. “Meat’s important, sure. But I don’t like it much, so tonight we’re having this instead. It’s good — just try it.”

I took the first bite myself, mostly to prove it wouldn’t kill them. It wasn’t bad. In fact, it was the best thing I’d eaten in a long time. I nearly cried.

The kids ate in complete silence, mechanically, like little machines refueling. No complaints. No small talk. And for me, that was a win.

When the plates were clean, they stood, carried their dishes to the sink, and then just… stared at me. Eyes blank. Waiting.

“Yes?” I asked, the smile long gone now. “Do you need something?”

“Aren’t you going to tell us what to do?” the oldest asked.

I hesitated, that familiar chill creeping up my spine.

“Oh, uh… I guess go in your room and find something to play with.”

They nodded as one, almost too in-sync, and padded off toward the bedroom without another word.

“Before you head back to your room—can you tell me your names?” I asked, surprising even myself.

The oldest girl tilted her head, eyes narrowing like she was weighing whether to answer.

“Jessa,” she said at last, voice soft but firm.

The red‑headed boy bounced on his toes. “I’m Milo,” he piped up, grinning as if proud to finally use a real name.

The littlest girl pressed her thumb to her lips, then sniffled. “I… I’m Lila,” she whispered, her gaze dropping to her feet.

“Jessa, Milo, Lila,” I repeated, letting each name settle. “Thanks for telling me. You can go now. It’s alright.” 

They filed past me in silence, their bare feet indistinct on the metal floor. Jessa paused at the door and glanced back.

“Goodnight, Mommy,” she said,then disappeared into the darkness beyond the bedroom door. 

Milo gave a quick wave without looking, and Lila clutched a doll close to her chest before slipping inside.

I stayed by the table for a long moment, listening to the soft scrape of toys being sorted and quiet whispers behind the closed door. Their names echoed in my head—reminders that they’re more than just extensions of him, as much as he’s tried to mold them into perfect little soldiers.

With their names in hand, I felt I had a bit more ground to stand on. Now to see if the front door really was locked…

The second they were gone, I tried the front door. I rattled the handle, pressed my shoulder against it, even dropped to my knees and checked the hinges — locked tight. Deadbolted from the outside, most likely. No key in sight. No way out.

I stood there, forehead pressed against the cool metal, letting the quiet swallow me whole.
The girl’s words circled back, louder now.
We can’t get out. We never get out.

I pulled myself away from the door and forced my focus onto the walls, tracing the edges where metal met plaster, where screws held scraps of this place together. Then I saw it — a vent. Narrow, but not impossible.

I couldn’t risk it now, not with the kids awake. I’d have to wait until they fell asleep, and when they did, I’d climb through that vent, find a way back to the hallway, and keep searching. I still needed a weapon and a plan. Now that there are three other lives involved I had to figure it out and quickly. 

I glanced back toward the kids’ room, where the soft murmur of their voices still drifted out beneath the crack of the door. They weren’t like me. They were just children. Small. Hungry. Tired. Programmed to expect the worst and survive it.

But that’s what gnawed at me most.
They’d been raised by him.

I didn’t know what they’d seen, or what they’d been taught, or what part of him lived inside their heads now, curled up and quiet, waiting for its turn to speak.

So no, I wasn’t afraid of the children.
I was afraid of what they might become.

I turned back to the vent and traced its edge with my fingers. 

Whatever this place was — whatever he had planned — I wasn’t going to be another forgotten photograph on that wall.

I waited for hours looking around, cleaning the kitchen and then finally…silence. 

I hooked my boot under the grille and tugged it free. The metal panel clattered against the floor as I knelt and tested the opening. It yawned just wide enough to force my shoulders through. I swallowed past the tightness in my throat, swung one leg up, and slid inside.

Dark swallowed me. I lay flat on the dusty floor of the duct, every breath echoing back at me. The air was stale, tinged with rust and something else—an oily, chemical tang that set my stomach roiling. I paused, listening. Faint creaks and distant thumps marked the bunker’s living machinery, but no footsteps. For now, at least, I was alone.

I wriggled forward, arms scraping the riveted metal sides. There were joints above me where the duct turned—sections bolted together, each one a promise of another tunnel. I counted them as I went: one, two, three turns. My heart kept pace with my crawls.

At the third bend, I felt a draft. Hope flared. I pressed my face into the gap and peered into a small chamber—a maintenance access above what looked like a supply room. Light filtered in from a cracked ceiling panel, and I could see shapes below: crates, tools, maybe the weapons cache I’d been hunting.

I inched toward the opening, arm extended until my fingers brushed the edge of the panel. It gave way under pressure, and I dropped silently into a dusty storeroom.

Concrete floors, shelves of hardware, coils of wire, and a workbench lined with old tools. My throat tightened with relief and dread in equal measure. I was inside the belly of the place, closer to the heart of its secrets—and maybe close enough to arm myself.

I scanned the bench: a heavy pipe wrench, a crowbar with a splintered handle, a length of chain. I grabbed the wrench first—it was solid, cold in my hand, like a promise of protection. Then I bent to inspect the crates. One was stocked with canned rations—useful. Another was labeled MAINTENANCE. I pried it open and found a rolled tarp, a coil of nylon rope, and a flashlight with half-dead batteries.

A soft click sounded behind me. My blood froze. I pressed my back to the shelves and gripped the wrench tight. The door to the supply room creaked on its hinges.

A rat darted into view and vanished through a crack in the wall. I exhaled in relief.

I crouched and rifled through the crates until my fingers closed on something hard and cold. Pulling it free, I found a pistol—small, semi‑automatic, empty one chamber but a half‑loaded magazine still seated. A lifeline. I tucked it into the top of my boot, careful not to snag the trigger.

Flashlight hung around my neck, wrench at my waist, gun in my boot, I slipped out of the supply room and found my way back to that weird living room that welcomed me into this place. 

With a grunt, I shoved the couch in front of the door. Wheels caught on the metal floor, but I heaved it into place. Then I grabbed the coffee table and dragged it next to the couch. A stack of crates from the corner came next, piled high until the door was completely blocked.

Satisfied, I slipped back through the  hallway toward the apartment. My heart stuttered as I approached the door, fearing they’d woken. I pressed my ear to the door but heard nothing but silence. 

I slid the wrench between the knob and the frame of the door and found what made the door lock from the outside. It took everything I had, but I forced it backward until it snapped free. The deadbolt fell with a clatter

I stood back and tested it: the door swung open easily now. No lock. No cage.

I now closed it with confidence behind me and found a door directly across from the children’s bedroom, its frame painted in a soft fading rose. My pulse thudded as I stepped in. Inside was a bedroom I could only describe as sincerely feminine. Lace curtains, a delicate vanity, a bed draped in quilts of muted florals. This had to be the room the moms stay in. 

It felt wrong to be here—an intruder in someone else’s sanctuary—but I hadn’t showered or slept in a real bed in who-knows-how-long. Guilt fluttered in my chest, then vanished as the memory of cold floors and metal walls swept over me. I shut the door behind me and clicked the lock.

The bathroom was just beyond the bedroom, pristine white tile glinting under a single bulb. Countertops were lined with glass bottles of perfume, soaps carved into roses, and jars of creams I couldn’t name. My skin crawled with impurity and—against all reason—thrilled at the luxury.

I peeled off my grimy clothes, put the weapons on the sink, and stepped under the shower. The water was scalding at first, then washed over me like a release. I let the heat fall heavy until the walls blurred and tears tracked down my cheeks. I couldn’t remember ever feeling so unwanted and, paradoxically, so relieved.

When I finally turned off the water, I toweled off and noticed the walk‑in closet door swinging slightly open. Inside, rows of silk blouses, cashmere sweaters, and tailored trousers in every shade gleamed back at me. My fingers itched to try something on.

I pulled out a pair of silk pajamas—soft ivory with delicate piping—and slid into them. In the corner, I found a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste. As I brushed my teeth, I caught my reflection in the mirror: eyes still rimmed red, skin flushed, and I had lost a good 30 pounds. For the first time in months, I felt more than just a survivor. I felt almost…safe.

Tomorrow, I’d return this guise to its solitude. But tonight, I would sleep in a real bed, cloaked in silk, with weapons by my side.",2,1745095842.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Flashlight hung around my neck, wrench at my waist, gun in my boot, I slipped out of the supply room and found my way back to that weird living room that welcomed me into this place. 

With a grunt, I shoved the couch in front of the door. Wheels caught on the metal floor, but I heaved it into place. Then I grabbed the coffee table and dragged it next to the couch. A stack of crates from the corner came next, piled high until the door was completely blocked.

Satisfied, I slipped back through the  hallway toward the apartment. My heart stuttered as I approached the door, fearing they’d woken. I pressed my ear to the door but heard nothing but silence. 

I slid the wrench between the knob and the frame of the door and found what made the door lock from the outside. It took everything I had, but I forced it backward until it snapped free. The deadbolt fell with a clatter

I stood back and tested it: the door swung open easily now. No lock. No cage.

I now closed it with confidence behind me and found a door directly across from the children’s bedroom, its frame painted in a soft fading rose. My pulse thudded as I stepped in. Inside was a bedroom I could only describe as sincerely feminine. Lace curtains, a delicate vanity, a bed draped in quilts of muted florals. This had to be the room the moms stay in. 

It felt wrong to be here—an intruder in someone else’s sanctuary—but I hadn’t showered or slept in a real bed in who-knows-how-long. Guilt fluttered in my chest, then vanished as the memory of cold floors and metal walls swept over me. I shut the door behind me and clicked the lock.

The bathroom was just beyond the bedroom, pristine white tile glinting under a single bulb. Countertops were lined with glass bottles of perfume, soaps carved into roses, and jars of creams I couldn’t name. My skin crawled with impurity and—against all reason—thrilled at the luxury.

I peeled off my grimy clothes, put the weapons on the sink, and stepped under the shower. The water was scalding at first, then washed over me like a release. I let the heat fall heavy until the walls blurred and tears tracked down my cheeks. I couldn’t remember ever feeling so unwanted and, paradoxically, so relieved.

When I finally turned off the water, I toweled off and noticed the walk‑in closet door swinging slightly open. Inside, rows of silk blouses, cashmere sweaters, and tailored trousers in every shade gleamed back at me. My fingers itched to try something on.

I pulled out a pair of silk pajamas—soft ivory with delicate piping—and slid into them. In the corner, I found a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste. As I brushed my teeth, I caught my reflection in the mirror: eyes still rimmed red, skin flushed, and I had lost a good 30 pounds. For the first time in months, I felt more than just a survivor. I felt almost…safe.

Tomorrow, I’d return this guise to its solitude. But tonight, I would sleep in a real bed, cloaked in silk, with weapons by my side.",1,1745095819.0,u_Brotatochip411,0,1.0,False

However, I may be in a better spot than most users who come here because I know myself incredibly well. Through struggle, poverty and addiction, I have nevertheless utilized my resourcefulness with people to relatively succeed in the hospitality industry, the insurance industry and the mental health industry. I have an incredibly artistic personality in that I effortlessly spend hours/days/weeks on my music and writing ideas. I have written one book (unpublished bc it's kinda fucked up) and written 4 albums (1 released, the rest I am learning marketing to squeeze the most juice out of)

Through an inheritance from a somewhat distant family member, I have a chance to go to college. I don't want to take this chance for granted, Going to college for music or writing is not the wave for me though. As an artist it feels counterintuitive to learn to do what you do, but that's just me.

I know my strong points as a person: I can be socially very fluid and talk to any type of person. I can be funny on the fly and communicate very well with people. I'm an excellent public speaker. I have moderate wine knowledge and have worked every position in restaurants from dishwasher to bar manager and every role in between.

I have a nerdy aspect to me in terms of research and obsessions with certain subjects, particularly:

\- the audio recording industry (both music and podcasts, as a musician and podcaster;

\-Professional Wrestling, which I consume as an art form and historical cultural event. I'd be happy working in any role within a wrestling company just to move the industry forward;

\-Specialty beverage industry, namely espresso/coffee/wine/ cocktails. I have experience in this realm and have used it to attain a middle class living with no college in the past. As a subgenre of this, I am obsessed with glassware like rocks glasses, martini glasses, coupes, flutes, wine glasses, Gibralters, etc.",2,1745095543.0,findapath,3,1.0,False

I am not committed to church service or activities. As an adult now, I only go to church once in a while, mostly only when my mom asked me to. But I do fear God, believe in Jesus Christ, and know what’s biblically right and wrong. Let’s just say, I just do the bare minimum.

I have taken the bar exams twice, on two consecutive years, and failed. On those two failures, I never questioned God, never blamed him, never rebelled. I know I didn’t pass because I was not prepared, I lacked motivation then, mostly, I lacked faith. Then I moved abroad and worked for 3 years before I decided to try again for the third time. So, I went back to my home country after resigning from work, 4 months before the bar exam schedule.

On the first month, I was not able to review due to some illness I had. Then, starting the second month, my father called me from abroad (he always calls to check up on me, btw) asking about my review and if I already “asked” God for the thing I wanted most. I paused because I realized that I haven’t asked Him anything before, especially not those two first attempts to pass the bar exams. I lied to my father and I said “of course, yes”. Then a week after that, my dad came home. He figured I needed some support since I am all alone back home. So, the next Sunday after him coming home, we went to church. I was adamant at first, but I gave in. The pastor taught about the verse Matthew 7:7. Right then and there I was overwhelmed by his presence. Throughout the service I felt like crying, but I held it in and after coming home, that’s when I broke down and cry alone in my room. I knew God was telling not yo fret, He’ll be with me, all I have to do is ask Him. From then on, I went to church every Sunday unless when my review schedule could not permit me. And every time, the pastor’s message is something what I worry about and God’s message about it. 

On the first day of exams, I only had 2 hours of sleep. I have 2 subjects, 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the afternoon, but we have to be at the exam area at 5:00 am, and leave the premises at 6:00pm. I only had a mug of brewed coffee, 2 chicken fillets, and a banana for the whole day. Upon coming home, I didn’t know what to feel, I forced myself to eat dinner and while at it I am bawling my eyes out because I didn’t know how I managed to finish the exams. All I know is that it was God, I was with God, he was my strength. I was completely overwhelmed by His grace. The 2nd day of exams 3 days after was also a success. And came the last day, at the last hour on the last subject, I can’t believe how God managed to get me through those rigorous days, I am beyond grateful. Mind you, I was still answering the last 2 items and I am already crying with joy. All I could pray for then was how grateful I am to be guided by Him, that never once I felt alone and defeated. 

I left the exam room, forget about the exams and left it all to God. I was so confident with my God that I never entertained the idea failure… and came the results after 3 months. I passed, finally, I am a lawyer. 

So, what am I shameful of? I succumbed to sin after securing what I wanted most.

I had a boyfriend for 10 years, our break up is nasty that I resorted to working abroad just to end things with him. We had no proper closure. He married a girl he just met because he got her pregnant just a month before I came home. I, on the other hand, have a boyfriend. He messaged me out of the blue, his daughter was just 3 weeks old then, he said he misses me and he still loves me. Of course, I dismissed him, even asked him if he’s not ashamed of what he’s doing. I thought I could talk sense into him, and maybe he just needs closure. 10 years in not short. I, too, needed that closure. So, I entertained him in casually… until one day we decided to meet, and I slept with him, a married man, and I, in a relationship. I knew it was wrong, biblically wrong, even one in the 10 commandments. But I was so blinded by the emotions. It happened again 2 more times. I know what I was doing, I had in mind then that I am already committing a sin, might as well take advantage of it.

Shameful. I am shameful. I am filthy. When I came to my senses, I could not get myself to attend church anymore because I felt like I’m a hypocrite going to church after what I’ve done. How can I face Him after what I did. I left the country with that guilt and shame. I only did not hurt his family, I also hurt my partner. I’m not a bad person, but I did bad, sinful things. The guilt is eating me alive. I couldn’t stomach the fact that when I was asking Him for something, I was all so good, and just after I got what I want, I had the audacity to break His commandment, commit a sin and do it not just once. I am immoral. I will carry this guilt for the rest of my life.

I am even ashamed of simply asking for forgiveness because what I did was so wrong that I don’t deserve to be forgiven. ",2,1745095311.0,Christian,2,1.0,False
1k35trq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tvfilmmusic/comments/1k35trq/the_boy_who_loved_nathan_mackinnon/,The Boy Who Loved Nathan MacKinnon,"\[DISCLAIMER: The following is a work of fiction.  Don't read if you're sensitive or easily triggered. Enter at your own risk.\] 

   Jesse was an elite college quarterback.  A  behemoth of a man,  he stood six feet two inches and weighed 190 pounds.  His sandy blonde hair and sapphire blue eyes also made him very popular with girls.  For the past year, he had been in a steady relationship with a drama major named Ashley. Jesse was the hardest working athlete on his team, which was how he earned his important QB1 position.  His coach knew he was destined for the NFL, but he probably wouldn't be drafted for another year.  

   During the off season his regular schedule was interrupted, which threw his whole life off kilter.  He found himself doing things that he wouldn't normally do.   This was how he ended up watching an NHL playoff game between the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars.  Jesse didn't consider himself a hockey fan, but he liked the continuous play and the rhythm of the sport.  He was amazed by how the players could pass, score, fight, and a whole lot more while at the same time balancing on their thin skate blades.   Jesse had tried ice skating once, but that didn't end well. 

   It wasn't too long before Jesse became totally engrossed in hockey.  There was one player in particular who grabbed his attention.  The announcer called him Nathan MacKinnon.  When the camera panned to him in his #29 jersey, the dude looked fierce.  If he had been a football player, then he probably would've been a quarterback or a running back.  But Jesse felt something more than admiration for the guy.  It was a feeling that he'd never felt for another man before.  Something very, very dangerous.

   After the game was over, Jesse googled Nathan MacKinnon and watched some of his highlights on YouTube.  The next day, he bought a MacKinnon jersey from a sporting goods store and found a hockey magazine at Walmart that featured him on the cover.  Jesse didn't know what came over him.  He had never been enamored of a male athlete before, not even one who played his own sport.   MacKinnon was built different. Although his height was average for an athlete, he looked a lot more muscular than his peers.  His ferocious attitude and steely determination were also very endearing. 

   Maybe Jesse had always been gay and not known it. It wasn't something that you simply became.  You were born that way, as Lady Gaga once said. Be that as it may, Jesse felt like a complete sicko for jacking off while he gazed at MacKinnon's poster that he taped to his wall in between magazine clippings of Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow.  It would be another secret that he would take to his grave, along with the principal who grabbed his ass at his Catholic middle school and the prostitute who exposed herself to him at the train station. 

   Jesse knew what his old man would say.  His father was an ultra-conservative asshole who had voted for another ultra-conservative asshole.   They shared the same first name and last name.  Jesse's parents had called him Jesse Jr. for most of his childhood.   He wondered if his father would disinherit him if he told the old man he was gay.  At least Jesse wouldn't get thrown out of his parents' house.  His full athletic scholarship not only paid for his tuition, but it also allowed him to have his own off-campus apartment. 

   While fully engulfed by his sexual identity crisis, Jesse wondered of course if he could still continue playing football.  What would the other guys think of him if they found out he was gay?  It could get weird really quick in that locker room.  He was naturally afraid that his coach would kick him off the team.  Would he be an embarrassment to his university?  But it was 2025.  Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as he'd imagined.  An actual NFL player had come out once, but he retired after only seven seasons.  He left to focus on his business, or so he said. 

   Then there was Ashley.  Jesse hated to break her heart, but maybe she would finally understand why he never felt ready to have sex with her.  He tried to make her believe that he wanted to wait for marriage. Truth be told, he was saving himself for the right person, which deep down inside he knew wasn't her.  At this point, he considered the possibility that he might never have been straight, even when they started dating.  He read somewhere that sexuality was in fact a fluid characteristic that often changed over time. 

   Jesse knew he would have to have a talk with Ashley.  They met early the next morning at the Viking Café on campus.  Despite the time, she was still bright-eyed and greeted him with a polite smile.  She was wearing that trendy Gucci Flora perfume, which seemed to be very popular these days.  After Jesse paid for their americanos, they found a table beside a window. 

   ""Thanks for getting up so early,"" Jesse began.

   ""If this is about moving in together, then I won't be able to get out of my lease for another two months,"" she said.

   ""No, it's not that.  There's something you should know about me."" He paused for a moment, trying to think of the right thing to say. He wanted to let her down gently. ""I think maybe…I might be into guys.""

   ""It's okay, Jesse,"" she reassured him.  ""I already knew that.""

   ""You knew?  Why didn't you say anything?""

   ""Because I loved you, and I kinda liked the fact that there weren't any pictures of naked girls on your walls.  You never tried anything stupid with me.  I always felt safe with you.""

   ""So…I guess this is goodbye,"" Jesse assumed.

   ""No, it isn't.  We can still be friends, like Will and Grace.""

   ""Yeah, like Will and Grace.""

   They finished their coffee and got up from their table.  After they recycled their cups, he gave her a really long hug. Then he wished her well before he went back to his apartment.  

   Jesse felt super relieved after his last date with Ashley. Nevertheless, it was his teammates that he worried about the most.  Football was his life, and he longed for a career in the NFL.  So he messaged his coach and all the players on the team through WhatsApp.  They met in their equipment room later that day.  Everyone gathered around and sat in a circle on the floor. 

   ""Guys, I have to tell you something,""  said Jesse.

   ""Are you leaving the team?"" a tight end named Jack wondered.

   ""You're moving to Toronto, aren't you?"" Will the linebacker asked. 

   ""He's already the quarterback, so it can't be a promotion,"" said the coach. 

   ""No guys, it's none of that,"" Jesse told them. He still couldn't bring himself to say the G word.  Like most other Gen Z guys, he hated labels. ""I don't know how to say this.  I guess I'm not like the rest of you.  I just realized something about myself the other day.  I'm actually …not into women."" 

   The room became so quiet that they could've heard a pin drop.  A minute later, Jesse's coach finally broke the silence.

   ""It's okay, Jesse,"" said the coach. ""I'm not gonna kick you off the team. I wouldn't even care if you were a Satanist.  You're staying, and that's that!""

   ""Yeah, man,"" said Lucas, who was a wide receiver. ""Did you mistake us for a bunch of closed-minded rednecks?"" 

   ""Well, I wasn't sure how you guys would react,"" admitted Jesse.  ""Some environments can be very hostile or downright unsafe for LGBT people.  Men like me are still being executed in Saudi Arabia and Iran.""

   ""Well, it's a good thing we live here,"" said Jack. 

   ""You can stay on the team as long as you want,"" the coach assured Jesse.  ""but whether you feel safe or not is entirely up to you.""

   ""Thanks, coach,"" Jesse beamed. 

   ""Bring it in guys!""  exclaimed Will. 

  The guys huddled together and placed their fists in the centre of their circle.  Then they pumped their fists in the air while they shouted ""Hawks!""  It was the name of their football team.  After the huddle, they dispersed and went about their off-season lives.  

   A million different thoughts rushed through Jesse's head all at once.  He was on a roll, so he might as well just rip off the bandage.  Seizing the moment, he hopped into his Mazda Miata convertible. He drove to his father's law office, trying not to exceed the speed limit in his sudden state of euphoria.  Then he parked in front of the brick building and marched into the reception area.  His father's paralegal tried to dissuade him from interrupting the old man because he was in a Teams meeting.  Jesse ignored her, making a bee line to the curmudgeon's office.  

   When Jesse burst open the door, his father stood up in shock.  The tension was so palpable. You could cut it with a knife.  Sensing his son's need for a serious discussion, Jesse Sr. graciously told his client that he needed to end the meeting and logged off his computer.

   ""Is everything all right, son?""  the old man asked.

   ""We need to talk, Dad,"" said Jesse.

   ""What is it, Jesse?""

   ""I'm gay, Dad.  I'm fucking gay!""

Throughout my career I had many good experiences in different areas that helped me learn a lot about technology, the market, career, leadership and team management. I feel I am a good manager and a great leader, I always delivery amazing results for the projects that I am a part of.

I also tried to start my own business three times: a coffee shop, a ice cream place and an e-commerce. My business always failed and I take full responsibility, but I learned a lot about the reality of owning a business.

I already mentor a lot of people at work, it is part of my job, and it is actually the best part for me. I feel that after all I've been through I have a lot to share and I can help people on how to manage teams or business, how to be a good leader, how to do well in interviews or plan a career chance, and probably more. In general I think I can help people do well in their careers.

**Now I want to start a side business as a mentor.**

I have time and experience. Also, I could use the extra money, because I am buying a house and starting a family. **But I have no idea how to make people want to pay to receive mentoring from me?**

I am not active on social media and I don't have a big tech company in my CV that will attract people.

My name is Coen, I'm an animation student enrolled at HKU and I'm currently working on a 5 minute short film with 2 classmates, Kajsa and Eryn, and our composer/sound designer Anton. It's about a man whose wife dies very suddenly in a car accident and has to face the grief and denial that comes after it.

Our character is a recently married man, in his early 30s. Who has a past of low self-esteem and not really feeling comfortable in his own skin. He can be a bit awkward and is often very mellow. He loves nothing more than music, his wife and playing music with his wife. Until her sudden passing in the film. After his wife dies he thinks she has been ressurected as a fox, he's in denial. The film is about him pushing through this grief and denial, seeing that he can't keep going like this and eventually letting go. We are looking for a naturalistic performance that includes subtle, but emotional acting. 

We will look at submissions featuring a **demo reel** and/or preferably an **audition**. Here is the dialogue we would like you to read for the audition: 

MR: “Not drinking your coffee, are you? (awkward, in denial, happy)”



“Come on darling, you’ll feel much better! (disappointed, begging)”



“Would it kill you to try?! (frustrated, angry)”

Decided to use my cards to find it and or led me straight to it. I'm so happy because (not only did I find the kindle) but it's the first time that I feel like I read the cards right and feel that I'm on the right path. 

My husband wasn't bothered and I just really wanted to share with someone. 

My cards were - 

Where is it? - 7 of pentacles (bit confused so I drew another) and got 7 of wands. Clearly 7 was important so read that as it being somewhere where I go to be with my thoughts. 

What colours are at it's location? 5 of cups grey/black with yellow underneath 

Symbols that represent the location? 4 of swords - lines and a window, possibly a bed.

Action I can take to find this card? 9 of wands - keep going 

Something I need to be mindful of when looking? The star , trust the cards/process.

Found the kindle in the loft room that I recently took the bed out of and made into my space to work, relax and practise tarot/witchcraft, spindles on the staircase on the way up and a small window in the corner which a big chair that I lay on to read.

Excruciating URQ abdominal pain, nothing like I had ever experienced before. I also have IBS so am used to stomach pains and digestive issues, but this was so different. I also have medicinally controlled GERD, hypothyroidism and PCOS, and am obese (not making excuses, but I have so many medical and mobility conditions, exercising is not easy. My portion control is not good, but I have a relatively good diet).

I went to emergency, and they gave me an Oxycodone for the pain, which I promptly threw up. I had an ultrasound, and the technician had trouble seeing my gallbladder, as apparently my liver is fatty. I don't have the usual diet that causes a fatty liver (don't eat fatty food, don't eat sweet food nor drink alcohol). But I have read that hypothyroidism and PCOS can contribute to a fatty liver. And genetics. Whatever.

They admitted me overnight, pumping me with anti-nausea medications as I kept throwing up. For some reason they didn't give me anything stronger than paracetamol for the pain (as I maybe told them it had eased off a little, in my delereium - I had been awake for 28 hours by then). They also put me on IV antibiotics as I currently have an infection in the gallbladder. I was mentally preparing myself for surgery the next morning, but the doctor decided it wasn't an emergency to get it removed, and they recommended a very low calorie diet (VLCD) to reduce my liver before the surgery is scheduled for in a month's time. 

I have started OptiFast last night (Level 1 - replacing all three daily meals). I am struggling already, not because of hunger, but:

1. the diarrhoea and gurgling stomach
2. the taste of the OptiFast. I have sensory issues relating to sweet food - cannot eat anything even vaguely sweet, so it limits me to the coffee flavour only.

Anyone who has it, what do you think of it?

I’m tryinf to find new perfumes for both warmer weather and colder.
I’ve tried The Only One before at the store maybe at the start of last year bc I heard it would be a good alternative to Black Opium. Personally, I didn’t care for Black Opium at all, there was nothinf special about it and the coffee note was nonexistant. Could only smell the pear. The Only One, I was able to pick up caramel and some coffee. Sweet and not heavy. What do you think of it? Would it be suitable for warmer seasons? I don’t want anything that’s overly sweet.

For colder seasons I was thinking more of Kayali Vanilla 28. My sister has it, to me it’s like a warmer and smoother vanilla scent compared to others i’ve tried. Very comforting. But definitely not for spring/summer imo.

Currently for spring I use Acqua Di Parma’s Fico di Amalfi or Elizabeth Arden’s White Tea Vanilla Orchid (the latter I dont really like anymore). I also have Chanel Gabrielle Essence, but that’s the most expensive bottle I have rn and don’t want to use it too often. So no specific scent for colder seasons rn.

I feel like i’m just rambling here, idek what I want. I like vanilla scents, fresh scents, slight citrus, oriental etc. It’s all mixed lol.",3,1745094619.0,Perfumes,7,0.81,False

I suspect that there's a population of readers who haven't yet found what they're looking for through the existing, limited number of book clubs in the area. Perhaps your taste in books doesn't match what's available or popular. That's how I feel, anyway, and given the difficulties already mentioned, I don't think the solution is to create one additional book club on the traditional model.

Thus, my half-baked idea, if people are interested, is to create a new local subreddit to facilitate informal, random book discussions. If you're reading a book, about to read a book, or thinking about reading a book, you can just post it on the new subreddit, and if other people happen to be interested, then they can co-read the book with you, and afterward the readers can arrange, publicly or privately, to discuss the book at a time and place of their choosing, in a (probably) small group. Ideally this discussion would be in person, at a safe place such as a coffee shop or library, which is the point of having a local subreddit. The group could be as small as two people, which is not really viable for a book club but perfectly fine for an informal discussion of one book. I think it would be fun to meet and possibly make friends with people who have similar literary leanings. Discussing the book on the subreddit is also be a possibility, though, if nothing else works, or if the readers don't feel comfortable meeting.

I've been trying to take my online privacy a bit more seriously lately. With so many trackers, geo-blocks, and sketchy Wi-Fi networks out there, I figured it was time to finally get a solid VPN. What really pushed me over the edge was realizing how exposed my data is when I'm browsing, streaming, or even just using public internet at a coffee shop.

So I started looking into VPN services. I’ve heard they can do everything from hiding your IP to unblocking Netflix libraries and protecting your browsing habits. But honestly? I had no idea there were *so many* options. And trying to figure out which VPN is actually the best (and not just backed by some flashy marketing team) turned out to be way more confusing than I expected.

Over the past few days, I did a deep dive into the best VPNs out there and decided to share my findings in case you’re in the same boat. Hopefully this can save you some time if you're searching for the best VPN in 2025 or just looking for a trustworthy breakdown like you'd find on best VPN Reddit threads.

Here are the main things I was looking for in the best VPN:

* How strong the security and privacy protection really is (encryption, no-log policy, kill switch, leak protection)
* Speed and streaming capabilities (especially for Netflix, Disney+, and other geo-blocked content)
* Number and variety of server locations
* Ease of use across different devices
* Price and value for the features you get

Here is the Comparison Table. I made it for my own research, but I figured it might help others too. Feel free to check it out:

If there are any VPN providers you think I should add to the list, or if you’ve tested one yourself that’s been great (or not so great), let me know! Also open to suggestions on other criteria that might be useful to compare.

Let’s help make this the go-to list for anyone trying to figure out the best VPN 2025, whether you're looking for speed, privacy, or just trying to unblock your favorite shows. If you’re like me and tired of sorting through biased review sites, hopefully this gives you a more transparent view.

Everything started when I transferred to a new university after a year of brake from my first one (economics are not for me haha), and in about a week I met HIM. During the first semester we didn’t really talk or anything although I used to see him at uni a lot, but everything changed in second semester. We started to have a lot of lectures together, and because our surnames are alphabetically next to each other we would always be put in the same groups, so that also means that we have the same schedule. On Tuesday we have a big gap in schedule so we would go for a coffee (with a few friends ofc) and talk/gossip for about 2 hours. After a month of those coffees I realized that there might be something brewing (pun not intended), basically I realised I started to grow some feeling that I shouldn’t have. To put it plainly I’m starting to fall in love with him and I don’t know how to stop that. I don’t wanna distance myself because I enjoy our little friend group and that we are verry argumentative (in a good way) and can talk about complex matters (especially in our field of study).

So here is my final question: How do I stop my feelings without losing him as a friend?",0,1745093807.0,askgaybros,0,0.5,False

Where I'm staying, the cafe with the best tables also has the most background noise. Today I went in alone for a time-out. 

Grabbed a coffee and a window seat. 

Switched off the aids.
