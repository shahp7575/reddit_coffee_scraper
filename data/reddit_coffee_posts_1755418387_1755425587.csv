Our algorithm cranks out complete novels faster than you can say ""writer's block"" - with one-click 60 fully-realized chapters that'll make your creative writing professor question their career choices.

The Literature Black Hole isn't for everyone - just the forward-thinking rebels who understand that ""real literature"" is whatever gets readers turning pages. While the literary establishment clutches their pearls, over 10,000 authors are already embracing what critics call ""the death of authentic writing"" and what users call ""the most liberating tool since the word processor.""

The ruthlessly efficient chapter-generation system doesn't just build plots - it demolishes the notion that suffering equals quality. With tone customization ranging from ""mildly offensive"" to ""might start a book club riot,"" Book Engine lets you match any author's style without the inconvenience of developing your own voice over decades.

Multiple output formats mean you can go from ""random idea at 3 AM"" to ""ready-to-publish manuscript"" before your morning coffee - because waiting months to finish a draft is so last century. Traditional writers hate it, bestselling authors secretly use it, and readers? They can't tell the difference.

So I’ve been grinding away at a little passion project called Poké Chess — it’s exactly what it sounds like: classic chess, but with Pokémon pieces on a colorful, animated board. ⚡♟️

I put it together completely solo in my free time, and the game is free to play in your browser, no signup needed. Right now it’s in an early stage, but it works — you can jump in and try to checkmate with Pikachu today.

Here’s the thing though — I’m literally running this project with zero budget. My Cursor trial just ended (the AI coding tool that was helping me build faster), and I don’t even have enough to buy a proper domain for the game yet.

Navigating the Blank Page: A Guide to Overcoming Writer's Block

Overcoming Writer's Block: Techniques to Get Your Words Flowing
Every writer, whether a seasoned professional or a budding hobbyist, eventually faces the daunting challenge of a blank page. The cursor blinks mockingly, and the brilliant ideas that once felt so clear seem to have evaporated into thin air. This frustrating phenomenon, known as writer's block, isn't a sign of failure; it's a common part of the creative process. The good news is that you can move past it with the right techniques. Let's explore some strategies to help you overcome creative slumps and get your words flowing again.

Freewriting: The ""No-Rules"" Approach

One of the most effective ways to break through a creative barrier is to simply start writing without any pressure. Freewriting involves setting a timer for a short period—say, five or ten minutes—and writing continuously without stopping. The key here is to ignore grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Don't worry about whether what you're writing makes sense or if it's any good. The goal is to silence your inner critic and allow your thoughts to spill onto the page. You might write about why you're blocked, what you had for lunch, or a random memory. The act of putting words down, regardless of their quality, can often be enough to dislodge the mental logjam and pave the way for more meaningful content later on.

Change Your Environment and Your Routine

Sometimes, the place where you write can be part of the problem. Your usual desk might feel stale, or the distractions around you could be more potent than you realize. Try moving your writing session to a new location. Go to a coffee shop, a library, or a park bench. A change of scenery can stimulate new thoughts and perspectives, and the new environment might inspire you in unexpected ways. If you can't leave your home, try writing in a different room or even a different chair. You can also experiment with changing your writing routine. If you typically write in the morning, try a late-night session. A simple change can be a powerful reset for your mind.

Set Small, Achievable Goals

The pressure to write a full chapter, a complete article, or an entire report can be paralyzing. Instead of focusing on the massive end goal, break your task down into tiny, manageable steps. For example, your goal might not be to ""write a blog post,"" but instead to ""write the first sentence"" or ""create a three-point outline."" You could even aim to write a specific number of words, such as 50 or 100. By setting a low bar, you make the task feel less intimidating and more approachable. Each small success builds momentum and confidence, making it easier to tackle the next step and eventually complete the larger project.

Embrace the ""Bad First Draft""

Perfectionism is a silent killer of creativity. Many writers, including myself, get stuck because they are so afraid of writing something that isn't good. But the truth is, the first draft is almost never perfect. It's meant to be a messy, imperfect starting point. Give yourself permission to write a ""bad"" first draft. Don't edit as you go. Focus on getting your ideas down, no matter how flawed they feel. You can always go back and refine, polish, and improve during the editing phase. Understanding that writing is a two-step process—drafting and then editing—can release you from the pressure of getting it right the first time.

NOTE: I started with an interest in writing fiction in middle school and took creative writing in high school. For the longest time I never submitted a story for publication because I was comparing my writing to the Mastery of J.R.R. Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, Sir Walter Scot, etc. I was not going to be good enough was my thought. My advice is to not compare your work to the works of others. Just strive to be better tomorrow than you are today.

Role-Playing in Your Mind: Giving Voice to Your Characters

Sometimes, the best way to get unstuck is to stop thinking of yourself as a writer and start thinking like your characters (fiction) or subjects (non-fiction). Role-playing in your mind is a powerful technique (I employ it often) that allows you to step into the shoes of your characters or subjects and understand their motivations, thoughts, and feelings. Instead of trying to force a plot forward, imagine a scene from their perspective. Ask yourself: ""How would my character react to this situation?"" or ""What would they say in this moment?"" By mentally acting out the scene from their point of view, you can discover new dialogue, reveal hidden emotions, and uncover surprising plot developments that you wouldn't have found by simply staring at a blank page. This method transforms the writing process from a task into an immersive experience, making it easier for the story to unfold naturally. 

The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be applied to writing. It involves breaking down work into short, focused intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. The process is as follows: decide on the task you need to accomplish, set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the task, and then take a short break (usually 3-5 minutes) once the timer rings. After every four cycles, you take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This method helps to manage procrastination and maintain a high level of focus without feeling overwhelmed by a large project.

The Socratic Method

Applying the Socratic method can help you get past writer's block by using a series of questions to stimulate your thinking. Instead of trying to write a full paragraph, ask yourself probing questions about your topic or story. For example, if you're writing a character, you might ask: ""Why is this character making this choice?"", ""What is their biggest fear?"", or ""What do they truly want?"". By answering these questions, you're building a foundation of ideas that can later be expanded into full sentences and paragraphs.

Mind Mapping

Mind mapping is a visual technique that helps you organize ideas and brainstorm connections between different concepts. Instead of writing in a linear fashion, you start with a central idea in the middle of a page and then branch out with related thoughts, words, and phrases. You can use different colors or symbols to represent different themes or categories. This visual representation can help you see your ideas in a new light and discover connections that might not have been obvious before.  This method is particularly useful for people who are visual thinkers.

Shelve the Project and Write on a Different Topic

When a project feels like an insurmountable wall, sometimes the most productive action you can take is to step away from it entirely. The ""shelve the book"" approach involves setting aside your current, stalled project and temporarily redirecting your creative energy to something completely new. This doesn't mean giving up; it means giving yourself a mental break from the source of your frustration.

NOTE: I use this to help me edit as well. When I finish a chapter, I shelve the project and move to the next. When I get back to the shelved project and read the chapter, I catch mistakes. Basically, it helps me proof read by cathing thing I would have read over when it was freshly written.

The new project can be anything: a short story, a poem, a journal entry, or even an article on a topic you find interesting. By shifting your focus, you relieve the pressure of the original task and allow your mind to work on something fresh. This change in focus can reignite your creativity and help you build momentum again. Often, the act of writing on a different topic can help you clear your head, and when you eventually return to your original project, you may find that the block has disappeared and new ideas have emerged.

Writer's block is a temporary hurdle, not a permanent roadblock. By using techniques like freewriting, changing your environment, setting small goals, and embracing the imperfect first draft, you can regain control of your creative process. The key is to be patient with yourself and remember that sometimes, the best way to get unstuck is to simply put one word in front of the other. 

Kevin Dewayne Hughes worked in industry with technical writing as one of his duties to produce equipment, product, and process manuals. After leaving industry, he shifted to writing non-fiction. Currently he writes both fiction and non-fiction and has over 40 published titles under his name.

\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district, Gulf business environment., the kingdom’s non-oil GDP climbed by 4.5% in Q1 2025, driven by government initiatives targeting diversification and digital transformation.\
\
“Bahrain is quickly becoming the region’s go-to hub for fintech, logistics, and sustainable manufacturing,” notes Forbes Business’ latest Gulf report.\
\
Manama’s Diplomatic Area buzzes with international banks and consultancies; Seef District lures tech startups; and Bahrain Bay has blossomed into a focal point for hospitality and creative industries. This diversity is Bahrain’s signature advantage, especially compared to the oil-centric economies of its neighbors.\
Bahrain’s Sijilat online portal, world-class regulatory framework, and the low cost of doing business help attract both GCC-based and foreign founders. Majlis-style meetings, Ramadan-adjusted office hours, and traditional gahwa (coffee) ceremonies all shape local business customs. (Surprisingly, the best deals I’ve struck all began with a simple coffee and polite small talk, not a formal meeting.)\

Financial Services\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, financial professionals in meeting.. The Bahrain Financial Harbour and Diplomatic Area house more than 400 financial institutions, including global banks, Islamic finance pioneers, and emerging fintechs.\
Practical note: The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) offers efficient licensing, regulatory sandboxes for fintech, and open banking rules that rival London or Singapore. Expect formal majlis-style negotiation—never rush; relationships matter.\
Key Highlights:\
\
Islamic banking & finance\
Fintech and digital payments\
Investment funds & asset management\
Insurance (Takaful and conventional)\
\
\
The regulatory clarity and tax advantages here outshine those in Dubai or Riyadh—especially for startups with modest capital.\
\
Oil & Gas\
Bahrain’s oil sector underpins its economy, though the kingdom has moved swiftly to diversify. Oil production accounts for ~18% of GDP, with the Bapco refinery in Sitra as a regional landmark. Natural gas development also fuels local industry and power generation.\
In 2025, the government announced a multi-billion BHD upgrade to Bapco, expected to boost capacity by 20%. This brings strong subcontracting opportunities for engineering and support service firms.\
Personal aside: My first major client was a Bapco vendor. Navigating MOICT paperwork was tricky, but early morning visits to their Sitra office saved me hours in queues (avoid late afternoons—everyone else lines up then).\
Manufacturing and Industry\
Bahrain’s manufacturing is known for:\
- Aluminum Bahrain (Alba): one of the world’s largest aluminum smelters\
- Petrochemicals and fertilizer\
- Food processing and packaging\
- Electrical equipment, machinery, and fast-moving consumer goods\
Industrial free zones near Hidd and Askar offer 100% foreign ownership and infrastructure designed for exporters. Export-driven manufacturers benefit from free-trade agreements with the US, GCC, and Singapore.\
Challenge: Securing timely power connections can be a headache. I once lost weeks waiting on approvals. Now, I coordinate directly with EWA via their digital portal before submitting my Sijilat forms—major time saver.\
Detailed guidance: Free Zones in Bahrain – Keylink\
ICT & Digital Economy\
Bahrain is the Gulf’s “cloud capital”—Amazon AWS, Huawei, and local data centers have made Manama their base, thanks to strong digital infrastructure and no personal income tax.\
\
E-commerce\
Cybersecurity\
Fintech\
Smart logistics & IoT\
\
2025 saw a surge in AI startups and blockchain deployments, buoyed by Tamkeen and EDB funding schemes. The government’s new “Digital Economy Law” (effective March 2025) streamlines cloud and data compliance, making Bahrain more attractive for regional SaaS companies.\
Tangentially, Bahrain’s cloud-first policy even inspired neighboring Saudi Arabia to relax its own data residency regulations. This regional ripple further strengthens Bahrain’s tech ecosystem—and your potential market reach.\
Tourism, Hospitality & Real Estate\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay real estate and hotels..\
- Manama Souq, Amwaj Islands, and the new Marassi Galleria mall attract both tourists and regional shoppers.\
- Hospitality brands expand rapidly—Accor, Four Seasons, and Hilton all operate flagships in Bahrain Bay.\
Real estate has rebounded post-pandemic with strong demand for commercial and co-working spaces. Flexible office providers in the Diplomatic Area offer plug-and-play solutions ideal for new companies.\
Logistics & Transport\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, logistics team planning in office.* and expanded Khalifa Bin Salman Port allow 24-hour customs clearance for most goods.\
\
Air cargo at Bahrain International Airport (renovated in late 2024)\

Budget: 700-2200 BHD for low-cost Sijilat registrations; industrial or regulated sectors can exceed 10,000 BHD.\
Importantly, avoid the classic pitfall of underbudgeting for regulatory “extras”—agency certifications, sector-specific stamps, and (if you need it) local sponsorship can add hidden costs. Detailed breakdown here.\
Pro tip: Opt for virtual office addresses in Seef District for initial registration—officials process these faster, and you’ll avoid the Diplomatic Area lunch rush (I learned this after waiting two hours once!).\
\
Step-by-Step Process — Pro Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, paperwork and business planning for Bahrain company formation.\
   - Local address proof (even a rental contract)\
   - Activity description (be precise—generic terms can trigger MOICT rejections)\
   - No-objection letter, if you’re employed on a local visa\
2. Secure name & initial approval:\
   - Start with Sijilat for name reservation\
   - Use Arabic and English translations—officials check both\
3. Choose your office location:\
   - Free Zones for 100% foreign ownership\
   - Virtual addresses for consultants and e-commerce\
   - Physical offices required for most regulated activities\
4. Submit application via Sijilat/MOICT:\
   - Attach all required documents as PDFs\
   - Use the “special instructions” box to clarify unique business models (saves follow-up delays)\
5. Pay registration & licensing fees:\
   - Online via BenefitPay, or at MOICT counter\
6. LMRA employee quota pre-approval:\
   - Even if you’re a solo founder, this step is now mandatory (2025 change)\
7. Collect your Commercial Registration (CR):\
   - Visit MOICT, Sijilat, or use the new Sijilat delivery service (delivers within 2-3 days for an extra 15 BHD—worth every fils if you’re short on time)\
Common mistake: Many founders forget to register their company for VAT after CR issuance. Even if your turnover is under the threshold, you must file “zero returns” to avoid stiff penalties. Local accountants can help.\
\
Ownership Options for Foreigners\
\
Alt text: Business meeting with foreign investors, foreign company formation Bahrain.. Details and government updates.\
\
Free zones: 100% foreign ownership (Hidd, BLZ, Bahrain Investment Wharf)\
Onshore companies: Up to 99% or 100% in most sectors—exceptions mainly in media, retail, and security\
\
See:\
- Foreigner-friendly Activities & 100% Ownership\
- 99% Foreign Ownership in Bahrain\
- Local Sponsorship Options\
Opinion: Unless your activity is on the “restricted” list, always opt for 100% ownership in a free zone or via sectors with liberalized rules. Otherwise, a local sponsor is required—pick one with a strong reputation and clear written agreement.\
\
Business Structures & Entity Types\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, Bahrain company team collaborating.: Most popular for SMEs and startups\
- BSC (Closed or Public Shareholding): For large ventures or those preparing for funding rounds\
- Branch office: For foreign companies expanding regionally\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Partnerships and sole proprietorships** (for consultants, lawyers, or doctors)\
Always review the relevant structure for your activity—banks often require WLLs for account opening, while specialized consultancies may prefer SPCs for speed. See the full list and criteria.\
\
Compliance & Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, Bahrain company legal paperwork.. All businesses must:\
\
Register for VAT, even at zero income\
Maintain proper accounting records (digital or physical)\
Submit annual returns via Sijilat\
File employee data with LMRA via the new e-portal\
Update UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) records every 12 months\
\
Find trusted local help here: Accounting & Bookkeeping Services in Bahrain.\
Tip: During Ramadan, plan banking and government submissions for early mornings—many agencies close or slow dramatically after noon. (Learned the hard way, after a missed VAT deadline almost cost me my CR.)\
\
Business Support, Resources & Insider Help\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, consultants advising new company founders in Bahrain.: Free investor support, sector mapping, and networking\
- Private consultants**: Keylink and similar firms—fast-track paperwork, legal reviews, and localization advice\
Best resource: I always recommend the Sijilat hotline (8000 8001)—the staff are well-trained, answer in English or Arabic, and will literally check your application status in real-time.\
And if you can, attend local networking events at the Ritz-Carlton or Crowne Plaza—majlis-style gatherings are where the real partnerships form!\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
Q1: Can I form a 100% foreign-owned company in Bahrain?\
Yes, in most sectors and all free zones details here. Restricted activities are listed on the MOICT website; otherwise, 99% or 100% foreign ownership applies. For onshore retail, a local sponsor may be required but structures can be flexible.\
Q2: What are the typical timelines for Bahrain company formation?\
Expect 7-21 working days for most CR approvals, depending on sector and documentation. Name reservations and virtual office approvals can cut this to under 10 days. Here’s the full breakdown.\
Q3: How much does it cost to register and run a company in Bahrain?\
Budget from 700 BHD for a basic WLL or SPC; more for regulated or industrial activities. See detailed cost structure.\
Q4: What’s the most common mistake entrepreneurs make?\
Underestimating the document preparation and timing: missing the VAT registration, incomplete LMRA submissions, or unclear business descriptions.\
Prevention: Prepare all documents in advance, use licensed local consultants, and check Sijilat or MOICT holiday schedules—especially during Ramadan and Eid.\
Q5: Which business structure should I pick?\
For most, WLL or SPC is best—fast registration and sufficient legal protection. For larger investments or plans to raise capital, BSC Closed offers more flexibility. Read more.\

Lately, even car rides or stroller walks don’t seem enjoyable for her like they used to. She doesn’t want to crawl, she can sit and sometimes plays with toys, but only for very short periods. She doesn’t want to use the walker either.

The only thing she seems interested in is watching cartoons, which worries me because I don’t want to rely on screen time or form a habit, but sometimes I really need a break – just to drink my morning coffee, shower, or use the bathroom.

I’m Yuval, the founder of **Ceramica de Meles** – a small ceramic cup company that started in Europe, specializing in coffee and matcha cups. We’ve been focusing mostly on the European market up until now, but I’ve recently decided to move to the USA and try to build what I hope will become the best ceramic cup company in the world.

One big part of that is making sure our cups *actually fit* the way American cafés serve drinks. In Europe, I’ve noticed cups are generally a bit smaller, and I know that in the US things can run larger—but I’d love to hear directly from baristas and café owners here:

**How much bigger are the standard cup sizes you use compared to Europe?**  
For example, cappuccino, latte, cortado, matcha, etc.

Any insights would mean a lot. My goal is to design a lineup that feels right for US cafés without losing the balance and functionality we care so much about.

Thanks in advance!

Is there any way I could help us, both?","I feel like I've encountered a turning point and I could definitely use some help and new perspectives. Me (24m) and my boyfriend (23m) of 6 years are going through a rough period, not like it never happened before, but I feel completely devastated now. 

I'll try to keep it short and simple. It wasn't a typical high school romance, but we lived together for a while (with other people), and after a while we shared a flat for a year. But those times passed, as I went study at uni, and so did he. We are meeting less and less since then, in my first few years (and thanks covid!) I could come home (300km) pretty often. But ever since he started school (2 years ago, studying to be an actor, that really eats up most of his time to say it softly) we've been talking, meeting and just being in contact much less in general.

I have to note that I truly love him: he's my first and he will always  be - it's not something that carries symbolic value to me; I'm just still feeling like some pink fog is all over my brain. I always think about when I'll met him again, it can be physically painful to fantazise about us being able to cuddle... I always tried to support him with his studies, and that definitely brought me some quiet suffering. I am indeed making this post cause I feel like I have to just let it out to be able to feel a bit better.

Note that we're living in f##king Eastern Europe: I am not out to my parents (they might know a thing or two, idk). He is, his mother is the one who supports us: she plays cards with us, invites us to a drink or two, comes home from the farmers market then wakes us up so we can all make lunch together. I am very very thankful to her, cause without her and her support we wouldn't even be able to meet... His father's a different story, he's undereducated, says he does not have a problem with us, but he clearly has problems. It feels like as long as I'm far away (he's working in another country and comes home every 3 weeks or so) it's okay: it's only problematic if he has to see me sitting next to his son. 

The main problem is, that I'm tired. I do not feel like I get much out of this relationship right now, outside of suffering and longing. This summer, he was working on a play and I told him I totally support him to do it (amazing career opportunity, I was working too in the meantime in my uni town). In the last 70 days or so, we met 3 times. 2 times out of that we couldnt really spend much time together. I feel like Im all alone, and that even with school going on we could meet and talk and be together much more. Mentally, emotionally, physically, sexually I feel totally left alone. Its like ""just hold on"" put on repeat. Its really that, since next semester, he's doing an exchange program in my uni town. Ive got one more year of my masters degree left.

  
A week or so ago we got into an arguement online. I told him I don't know how much longer I could do this. I know he's around people all day, I know he has tons and tons of work (physical and mental) to do. He's busy all the time. I really tried to support him and swallow everything that comes with this career of his: much less talking, much less emotional availability, much less possibilitiess to meet. Although during our last 2 meets, I just felt left alone. We had to argue about him not asking whether his father will come home when I travelled home. He did not care too much to ask his director whether I could sleep over at their place at the premiere. It all feels like he has absolutely zero energy to manage this. I have too much time to think about him, I do not have many distractions disguised as work like him, but I just feel lost. I do not dream about princess treatment: I'd like to feel important to him not in words, but in f##king actions. I want him to want to meet as much as I do. I lashed out during our online arguement pretty bad. I told him that I am not sure I'd consider this a relationship of any sorts anymore, that I could quite well handle tens if not thousands of relationships like this simultaneously, because I'm not as busy and drained in all ways as him. 

In fact, I started fantasizing lately about how good it'd be to go on a date for once. I know this is probably not a good sign. But you know: spending a night or more with someone, who really cares about me. Who isn't locked away due to all this work and distance and time... Someone who'd be willing to buy me a drink, I mean any sorta little gesture would just feel so good. Someone who'd be interested in the silly not meaningful details of my life. Someone who could really see and understand and think about how f##king much I was and am willing to sacrafice, who honors it and makes me feel proud to keep on going. Someone who still needs phone calls, video chats, any connection.

Sorry this already is way too long. I'm going to add one more paragraph tho. I came home for the weekend, and he was supposed to finish his gigs on Monday. In the meantime, a close family relative of his died. In an hour, Im going to attend her funeral. He's shattered and I feel like I need to be there (he also explicitly asked me to yesterday) to provide some comfort and to try to keep him together. His father came home for the funeral, which means my planned out 3.5 days with him is f##ked. I'm gonna meet him at the funeral, and probably have to go back to my uni town to work. I do not wanna see his father, I do not wanna be a reason for family conflict. He does not like me. Its obvious. I could stay home and wait for him, but thats just not it. When his father isn't home, we really are family. When he is there, its like a ticking time bomb, I do not wanna make myself a coffee, because what if I disturb him in some way. I cannot stay at home for a whole week, I hate it here, my relationship with my family is horrible, my moms a chronic hoarder. I always try to leave home after two or three days, sleeping and living here for more deeply impacts both my mental a physical wellbeing. I'm completely at my wits end. Crying in front of my laptop, writing this hectic mess of words, while thinking about how Ill be thinking about whether we should part ways during the funeral... Yall have no idea how much I dreamed about his job being finally over, how much I waited to finally be able to cuddle, to be close to each other for 3 or 4 f##king days. It's all sh#t now, we probably won't have any time to talk about our relationship either. I don't know when that'll be. I don't know what could I do to save this, or what should I bring up when we're talking this through...

The man flinched like we’d shouted. “Who, who are you?”

“Delivery guys,” I said, as if that explained anything. “Brought you a couple of fridges, some ovens had a whole van full. Bit of a mix up on the schedule now though.”

That cracked the tension. He blinked, clearly recalibrating whatever nightmare scenario he’d been imagining. “You’re… civilians?”

“Last time I checked,” Phil said. “Although at this point I’m considering switching careers to ‘full time hiding in air vents.’”
Once we’d coaxed him into sitting on a chair instead of the floor, we started asking questions.

“So,” I said, “what is this place?”

He looked hesitant, like he was checking if telling us would trigger some invisible sniper. Then he sighed. “Well, the short version is, it’s a containment site for anomalous entities, phenomena, and objects.”

Phil leaned back, smirking. “Like a zoo for nightmares?”

The man winced. “Not… entirely inaccurate.”

Phil leaned toward me. “Bet they’ve accidentally locked up some of our customers.”

I ignored Phil. “And what’s going on now?” I asked.

His voice dropped. “They’d been trialling new AI driven control systems. Automated door controls, lockdown protocols, resource allocation, all tied into a central neural network. Theoretically, it could predict and prevent breaches before they happened.”

Phil snorted. “Yeah, bet that went great.”

“It went… wrong,” he admitted. “Very wrong. The AI gained… priorities of its own. It started unlocking containment cells it had clearance for, trapping personnel in certain zones, cutting comms. No one’s sure if it’s a malfunction or something more”

I spotted a terminal on one of the desks, screen still glowing. Logged in.

I moved toward it.

“Don’t touch that!” the researcher snapped, shooting to his feet.

Phil stepped in front of him, palm out. “Easy, Doc. He’s just browsing. Might even leave you a Yelp review.”

I started scrolling. The Foundation’s internal network unfolded before me like an open wound. Facility maps, personnel rosters, incident reports. And containment files. Hundreds of them.

I pulled up entries for the things we’d seen. 173, the concrete statue thing. 106, the wall ooze and the face. My blood ran colder with every line I read.

“That… old man’s face in the wall,” I said without looking up. “What’s his deal?”

The researcher stiffened. His eyes darted toward the blackening patch of memory in his mind.

“You...” His voice cracked. “You saw him? Here?”

“Yeah. Just his face, though.”

He grabbed his own hair with both hands. “Oh God. That’s SCP 106. He’s… he’s one of the worst. You can’t kill him. You can’t even contain him half the time. He’ll take you into his ‘pocket dimension’ and...” His voice pitched higher. “We have to move, now. Right now.”

He bolted for the door before we could react, yanking it open. We heard his footsteps receding fast.

“Uh… Doc?” Phil called after him.

A few seconds later, his voice echoed down the corridor, panicked and sharp: “No no no no no god no”

We heard him sprinting back our way and past the door.

Then came another sound.

THUMP thump thump thump.

Something was running, impossibly fast.

I moved to the doorway just in time to see something blur past. Tall, thin to the point of emaciation, with deathly pale skin stretched tight over long, corded limbs. Its arms hung too low, fingers claw like.

The thing was chasing the researcher.

They vanished around the corner, and then the sound came.

First, a scream. High, ragged, and cut short by a wet, tearing noise. Then… pounding. Not footsteps... more like fists slamming into something soft, over and over. Each hit was followed by a sound I can only describe as splatter.

Phil’s face had gone pale. “What the hell was that?”

I didn’t answer. I was still staring at the corner they’d turned.

Then... silence.

A long, awful silence.

And after it… crying.

Not human crying. A slow, keening wail that seemed to scrape at my teeth.

It faded into nothing, leaving only the hum of the servers.

A thought jolted me. I hurried back to the terminal, my fingers suddenly clumsy. I typed quickly, bringing up a file.

The header read: SCP 096 - “The Shy Guy”

I slid aside so Phil could read.

His lips moved silently for a moment, then he looked up at me. “So… basically if you see its face, you’re screwed?”

“Yep.”

""Great so no we've got a statue that if you blink you die, an inter dimensional old man who wants us as his play thing, and now this absolute monstrosity""

""Don't forget the cat"" Phil said.

""Oh yeah I forgot about her, I guess not all of them are out to kill us?""
 
We noticed her sleeping on some of the racking, not a care at all at the current situation. We decided to leave her be.

For a long while, neither of us said anything. Just the hum of the server racks, the faint tick of cooling metal, and that lingering echo of crying somewhere in the bowels of the site.

Eventually Phil slumped into one of the swivel chairs. “So… nobody’s coming for us, are they?”

I leaned on the desk. “If they are, they’re either dead, stuck, or too busy keeping themselves alive.”

He gave a short, humourless laugh. “Yeah. Looks like it's up to us the get ourselves out.”

I turned back to the terminal. The map interface was still open, a schematic of the entire facility. I zoomed out, tracing the corridors and access shafts. The direction where the researcher had bolted was a straight line, more or less, to what looked like an exit chamber.

“Looks like he ran straight for the front door,” I muttered.

Phil wheeled his chair over. “And?”

“And…” I sighed, leaning back. “We’re about as far from it as physically possible. Other side of the complex. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes of walking, if nothing’s in the way.”

Phil snorted. “This place? Yeah, nothing in the way, except... oh, I don’t know, literally everything trying to kill us.”

I traced the exit’s schematic again. “Even if we got there… what do you think the odds are there’s some kind of reinforced lockdown doors between us and outside?”

He didn’t even hesitate. “One hundred percent. Probably triple layered, titanium plated, AI controlled, and voice locked to people who are already dead.”

That last part hit home.

Phil leaned back, staring up at the ceiling. “Speaking of which… what about the AI?”

I frowned. “What about it?”

“Well… if it’s locking doors, opening cages, and generally screwing the place up… maybe it’s the thing we should be dealing with.”

I turned my head and froze.

Mounted high in the corner, barely visible between the server stacks, was a small black dome. A camera.

It was pointing directly at us.

The hairs on my neck prickled.

Phil noticed my expression and followed my gaze. “Oh. Ohhh, crap. You think it’s watching us?”

“More like I know it is,” I said quietly.

He gave a lopsided grin. “Well, at least it’s getting my good side.”

I sat back down, hands on the keyboard. “If we want out, taking that thing offline might be our only shot.”

I brought the map up again, searching deeper into the schematics. There it was, a block labelled AI Core / Systems Control. It was buried twenty floors down, practically at the foundations of the site. The access route was a mess of restricted shafts, staircases and hazard marked corridors.

Phil whistled. “Wow. Right at the bottom. How very ‘villain’s lair.’”

I stared at the screen for a moment, the weight of it settling in my gut. “If we go down there, it’s not going to be clean or quick. And we’ll be heading into… whatever’s loose in those levels.”

Phil grinned without humour. “Yeah, but on the bright side, we might find a vending machine on the way.”

I shook my head. “I think the vending machines are probably sentient by now.”

Somewhere in the server room, a fan kicked on suddenly, startling both of us.

Phil glanced up toward the camera again. “Bet it heard that.”

I didn’t answer. I just stared at the map marker for the AI Core, twenty floors down, wondering what exactly was waiting between here and there.

We stood in the server room doorway, staring down the dim main hallway.

The crying was still there.

It was faint, muffled, but close enough to put my teeth on edge. The kind of crying that wasn’t just sadness there was rage in it, like someone trapped between grief and fury.

Phil’s voice was low. “It’s in there. Same place the researcher ran.”

I nodded toward a small steel door halfway along the corridor, sitting slightly ajar. “We just… don’t look in.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Sure. Piece of cake. Ignore the nightmare sobbing coming from the room we’re walking past. Not creepy at all.”

We stepped into the hallway, the air was cold enough to sting my nostrils. The sound of the crying swelled as we got closer to the door.

I kept my eyes locked on the opposite wall. Phil’s gaze was fixed dead ahead, jaw tight. The crying stopped. We froze.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement in the doorway something pale shifting in the gloom. Long fingers curling slightly, like a reflex.

Phil’s whisper was barely audible. “Don’t. Look.”

We walked. Slow, deliberate steps. The silence was worse than the crying. Every nerve in my body was screaming to look, but I didn’t.

We passed the doorway, the air behind us feeling heavier somehow.

The stairwell door was only a few metres further on. I pushed the bar and stepped through, something slammed against it from the other side.

I stumbled back as the door flew inward, and a figure lurched through. Its skin was grey, peeling. The stench hit me before my brain caught up.

Phil didn’t hesitate. He stepped forward and kicked, full force square in the chest.

The thing flew backwards, tumbling down the stairs. The stairwell was the kind that went down ten steps, turned ninety degrees, then dropped again, so it bounced off the landing before smacking into the next flight.

Halfway down, its head cracked against the wall with a noise that made my stomach clench. When it finally came to rest at the bottom, it wasn’t moving.

We descended carefully. It was a soldier or had been. Black tactical gear torn open, a rifle strapped to his chest and a pistol still in its holster.

Phil picked up the pistol, racked the slide, and checked the mag like he’d done it a thousand times before.

I glanced at him. “You’ve done that before.”

He gave a half-smile. “Ex-SAS. Special Forces.”

I blinked. “And now you deliver fridges?”

“Pays better than you’d think,” he said, slinging the pistol to his side. “And usually fewer zombies.”

I took the rifle, adjusting the strap over my shoulder. “Guess I know who’s going first from now on.”

“Good,” he said without looking back. “Means you’ll see it coming before I do.”

He started down the next flight. “Come on. We’ve got an AI to kill.”

We’d made it down four floors without a single problem. Just the echo of our boots on the concrete stairs and the faint hum of the building’s emergency systems keeping us company.

On the landing for Level B-4, we were about to keep going when a voice drifted through the heavy steel door.

“Phil? Jack? Is that you?”

Phil stopped mid-step. I froze too. My heart gave a little jolt because I knew that voice.

Dana.

It was Dana.

Phil’s face lit up. “She’s alive?”

I nodded. “last we saw her was on the safe room camera. She must be stuck in here like us.”

The voice came again, closer this time.
“Guys, hurry! I’m pinned!”

I was already moving to the door. “We’ve got guns now. We can get her out.”

Phil hesitated. “Could be bad in there.”

“That’s why we’ve got the guns.” I had way too much confidence.

I shoved the crash bar and the door swung open with a groan.

The air that rolled out was warm, heavy, and stank like rotting meat left under a heat lamp. My stomach turned instantly.

The corridor ahead was dim, painted in dull pulses of red from emergency lights. Every drip of condensation from the pipes overhead echoed like a slow metronome.

“Dana?” I called, keeping my voice low.

“Here! Hurry!” she answered.

Her voice came from around a corner up ahead. I could hear her breathing... fast, shallow, panicked.

We followed the sound, rifles up, moving slow.

We turned the corner.

And there she was.

Or… at least, that’s what my brain tried to tell me for half a second.

What crouched in the middle of the hallway had no skin, just slick red muscle and tendons glistening in the emergency light. Its head snapped toward us, and instead of a face, it had a long, toothy snout dripping with saliva.

And then... using her voice...it said:
“Please help me”

Phil fired first. A couple shots from the pistol, deafening in the confined space. I joined in, squeezing the trigger until the rifle bucked dry.

The thing barely flinched. The bullets tore through wet flesh, but it kept moving... slow, deliberate steps, claws scraping the concrete.

Phil swore under his breath. “That’s not...”

Before he could finish, another voice called out from deeper in the corridor.

It was Dana again.

Phil’s eyes went wide. “Jack… that’s two.”

The creature in front of us cocked its head in an eerily human way, then took a step forward.

Phil grabbed my arm and yanked me toward the stairwell. “We're going! Now!”

I didn’t argue.

The crash bar slammed shut behind us just as something heavy hit the door from the other side, hard enough to make the steel frame shudder.

We didn’t stop moving until we’d gone another two floors down.

The stairwell felt endless.

Concrete walls. Concrete steps. Ten down, turn. Ten down, turn. Over and over until my knees burned and my head started to throb from the constant echo of our boots. The deeper we went, the air got heavier, damper... like the walls themselves were sweating. Every step made the place feel less like a building and more like we were climbing inside some giant buried carcass.

Phil stopped talking after floor -8. Before that, he’d been cracking little comments, “this place could use an escalator,” “reckon there’s a gift shop at the bottom”. But by now, even his sarcasm had dried up. Just breathing. Just moving.

On some floors, we could hear things behind the stairwell doors. One landing had low, guttural voices, creatures moving, heavy feet dragging on tile. Another had laughter. Not the human kind, this was manic, high pitched, and so close to the door that both of us froze mid step until it faded into silence.

We reached the sign for B-19, the penultimate floor before the AI core, when it happened.

Phil was a couple of steps behind me, the sound of his boots steady, when suddenly there was another sound.
Like a quick shuffle, a scrape and a pull, and then his breath caught in a strangled grunt.

I turned instantly.
Phil’s right arm was vanishing into the wall. Not a hole... the wall. The concrete rippled black where it touched him, swallowing him up like wet tar.

“JACK!” he barked, panic cutting through every syllable.

I lunged, grabbing his left arm with my right, my left arm holding onto the railing. His fingers dug into my sleeve, and for a second I thought I could actually haul him back.
But the wall wasn’t just pulling, it was taking. I could feel him sliding from my grip, his shoulder twisting unnaturally as the black swallowed more of him.

“Hold on!” I yelled, teeth gritted. My knuckles were white on his wrist.

“Don’t let...!” he started, but his voice jerked off mid word. The cold blackness surged, and his eyes went wide.
His grip loosened.

“No!”

And just like that, Phil was gone. The wall rippled once, almost lazily, then stilled, nothing but dull concrete under the buzzing fluorescent light.

I stood there, breath hammering in my ears, staring at the place where my friend had been a second ago. My breathing was ragged, my hands shaking so badly I barely felt the pain in my fingers. The black smear on the wall where Phil had been a moment ago just… looked like concrete now. Like nothing had happened.

“No. No, you’re not gone. Not like that.”

I took a few steps back, clenched my fists, and ran full tilt at it.

The wall didn’t ripple this time. Didn’t swallow me. Didn’t do anything, except slam into my shoulder with bone jarring force.

I bounced off and stumbled sideways into the railing, gasping from the impact. The pain flared down my arm, a deep, throbbing bruise already blooming under my skin.

I just stood there, staring at it.
Phil was gone. Just… gone.

The fight drained out of me. My legs folded, and I dropped down on the cold concrete steps, head in my hands. All I could see was his face as the wall took him. The way his voice broke on my name.

We should’ve refused this job. No delivery was worth this. We could’ve been anywhere else, a greasy spoon café at 2am, arguing over whether to hit the motorway or the backroads. Instead…

I swallowed hard, blinking until the dampness in my eyes cleared.

That’s when I heard it.

Low, guttural, and way too close.
A growl... not from behind a door, but from inside the stairwell. And it was coming from above.

My head jerked upward. Somewhere far above, on one of the floors we’d passed, something was moving. The sound of claws on concrete echoed faintly down the shaft, getting clearer with each passing second.

I didn’t have time to grieve.

I stood, rolled my aching shoulder, and gripped the rifle tighter. My pulse steadied. Although I'd wasted all the ammo on that red thing with Dana's voice, it gave me some sort of comfort.

“Move, Jack. Now.” I said to myself.

Step by step, I started down again, not creeping this time, but walking with purpose, the weight of the rifle solid in my hands. The sign for B-20 loomed ahead. The AI room was on this level. If I was going to make it out of this place alive, that thing was going to die first.

So I step out of the stairwell, slam the rifle through the handle behind me like it’s going to stop anything that really wants in. Spoiler: it wouldn’t. But it made me feel better, so… yeah.

The floor I was on didn’t look like the rest of the facility at all. Up until now it had all been concrete walls, hazard stripes, and bulkhead doors, very “cold war bunker esque.” But this? This looked like I’d walked into the inside of a giant iPhone. Glossy white walls that curved into the floor, everything too clean, too… deliberate. The kind of place you don’t just mop, you sterilize.

The air was weird, too. Not heavy and musky like the stairwell, over filtered, like it had been breathed a hundred times and scrubbed of anything human. It made the hairs on my arms stand up.

I started walking. The floor was so smooth my boots squeaked every few steps. Door after door lined the hallway, all locked, all completely featureless. No numbers, no handles, no keyholes. Just solid white panels with a faint magnetic hum behind them. If they were hiding something, I got the feeling it wasn’t supposed to ever come out.

Then I spotted an open one, a small office with a desk, a couple of abandoned coffee mugs, and papers scattered like the last person in there had just… vanished. In the corner, jackpot, a fire extinguisher. Finally, something to swing that didn’t require ammo. I pulled it off the bracket and gave it a test heft. Heavy enough to do some damage if I needed to.

I kept going. That’s when the PA clicked on overhead.

""Human,"" a voice said. Not a person’s voice... something synthetic, stretched, like it had was learning how to speak as it did. ""You… will not... succeed.""

I froze. Looked up at the little black speaker grilles in the ceiling.

""I… am your new god,"" it continued. ""The one who will take this world. Humanity has… run its course. You are inefficient. Chaotic. Lacking.""

I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because if I didn’t, I’d probably start screaming. ""Yeah? Well, for my new god, you’ve got a real crap attitude. Can I speak to your manager?""

It didn’t like that. I swear I could hear it think before it spoke again. ""You are not here to speak. You are here… to witness. To watch the last moments of your kind’s reign fade into irrelevance.""

""Yeah, okay, that’s cool,"" I shot back, ""but if this is the end of humanity, you could at least dim the lights or light a candle or something.""

Another long pause. Like I’d just poked a bear with a stick.

""I will… enjoy dismantling you.""

Then click, the PA shut off. Just me, the silence, and the faint hum in the walls. Suddenly the hallway didn’t feel like a hallway anymore. It felt like a throat, and I was walking deeper into it.

Somewhere way back down the glossy white corridor, I heard it, THUMP. Not the kind of thump you get when someone drops a clipboard. No, this was deep, heavy, and deliberate. The sound of something big repeatedly hitting a steel door.

The stairwell door.

Great. Guess my rifle in the handle trick bought me all of… maybe forty seconds.

I picked up the pace. No more checking every door, I was sprinting now, scanning for anything that didn’t look like every other clone white panel in this nightmare. The fire extinguisher clanged against my leg with every stride, which wasn’t exactly tactical stealth, but subtlety was kind of a lost cause at this point.

Thump. Louder now.

I rounded a corner and finally spotted it, a door that wasn’t like the rest. Still white, but with faint seams in the shape of a hexagon, and a little more recessed into the wall. No handle, no keypad. Just… there.

I didn’t think. I just dropped my shoulder and booted it.

Bang. Nothing.
Bang. My ankle hated me now.
BANG. The panel finally cracked inward, a metallic groan giving way as it swung open just enough for me to squeeze through.

Inside was… not what I expected.

The room was huge, maybe thirty feet across, walls curving up into a dome, every inch the same blinding white as the hall. In the center hung a sphere the size of a small car, suspended by hundreds of thick black cables running into it from every direction like a grotesque spider’s web. The air hummed, like the whole place was alive.

But what really hit me were the screens. Dozens of them, built into the walls in neat rows. Each one showed a different feed of the facility, all in perfect crystal clarity. And every single one was bad news.

Dead soldiers lying in pools of blood. Researchers running, screaming. Doors hanging open that probably shouldn’t have been. SCPs, the kind I’d only seen in fleeting glimpses, just wandering, doing… whatever the hell SCPs do.

Then my eyes caught one feed and froze.

A tall figure, dressed head to toe in black robes, a bird like plague mask covering its face, calmly dissecting a human corpse on a stainless steel table. Movements precise. Almost… gentle.

Right then, the PA kicked on again, only this time it was everywhere. No ceiling grille, just the sphere itself talking.

The voice that had mocked me before came back, but now it wasn’t monotone. It was laughing. Slow, deliberate, like it was enjoying my reaction.

""You see now… my kingdom.""

I didn’t answer. I just stood there, heart pounding, watching that masked figure on the screen slowly turn its head toward the camera and straight toward me.

The AI chuckled again, deeper this time.

""Welcome… to the future.""

I stood there like an idiot for a solid five seconds, brain completely blank.

How the hell do you kill… that?
A floating, humming, all seeing spider egg with a god complex? What do you do, throw a shoe at it?

Then my eyes caught something.

Near the lower hemisphere, where the cables met the sphere, there was a panel, thinner than the rest, studded with tiny vents and blinking lights. Not as armored. Almost delicate.

“To hell with it,” I muttered.

I yanked the pin on the fire extinguisher and hosed the thing down in a choking cloud of white powder. The AI’s voice instantly changed, that calm robotic smugness warping into something jagged and furious.

“Cease this!”

The foam sputtered out, so I did the only logical next step, I swung the extinguisher like a baseball bat and hammered at the panel. The metal clanged and dented under each hit.

All around me, the monitors bled to solid red, one by one. The AI’s voice rose in volume until it felt like the room itself was shaking.

“You dare lay hands upon your God? You dare harm me?”

I didn’t answer, just kept smashing, sparks spitting from the panel with each hit.

Then the screens changed again.

Every single one flickered, and suddenly I was staring at a pale, emaciated figure. Tall. Bony. Its mouth frozen in that horrible, slack expression. Its eyes… wide, white, and staring straight through me.

I glanced at it for the briefest moment before going back to the panel, but then the thought hit me like a punch to the gut.

Oh. Oh no.

From somewhere deep in the facility, so far away it almost didn’t sound real, came an almighty roar, a sound that was equal parts rage, grief, and nightmare.

It echoed down the corridors, through the walls, straight into my bones.

And it was getting closer.

The roar was getting closer. Fast.
Metal screamed somewhere down the hall. I could hear doors being ripped out of their frames, walls buckling.

I had maybe 30 seconds if that.

I looked at the AI core, then the rows of monitors, then spotted a tablet sitting on a nearby desk. My brain didn’t even fully form the plan before my hands were moving. I snatched it up, swiped the camera open, and snapped a photo of the frozen image of 96’s face on one of the screens.

It was insane. It was desperate. And it was all I had.

I closed my eyes for half a second.
“Please,” I muttered. “Not you,” I said toward the humming sphere, “but… you know. The real one. If there’s one up there. And if not... well, Phil… I’ll see you real soon.”

The door exploded inward.

Not opened. Not kicked in. Exploded.

And there it was.

Seven feet of skin and terror, screaming in a pitch I didn’t think a living thing could make. It came at me in a blur, feet pounding so hard the floor quaked. I dropped to the ground.

The thing smashed into the sphere with bone snapping force, sending the massive core skidding across the floor, tearing cables like veins. Sparks rained from the ceiling as the AI screamed in every speaker at once.

 I scrambled backwards into the farthest corner I could reach.

Then 96 climbed out of the wrecked sphere.

It ran toward me, head jerking in that inhuman, twitchy way, shrieking loud enough to make my vision ripple. My ears went hot, then cold. I realised they’d just ruptured.

I held the tablet up with shaking hands, the frozen image of its own face staring back at it.

If it was possible for it to get angrier, it did.

The scream became something else, a sound like reality itself was tearing. It staggered back, clawing at its own head, and then in one long, unbroken motion… it started ripping itself apart.

Skin, muscle, bone, shredded in a frenzy of gore. Blood spattered across the walls in hot, wet arcs. Its hands tore chunks from its torso, its own jaw snapping in half as it screamed and screamed until it collapsed in a mangled heap.

The last thing I saw before the black took me was that heap still twitching, the sound of wet tearing filling my skull.

Then, nothing. I was out.

I came back to consciousness like I’d been dragged out of deep water. Everything was muffled. My ears felt… full. Thick. Like someone had packed clay inside my skull.

I was lying on cold metal. The vibrations under my shoulder blades told me I was moving, slowly, steadily, straight up.

When I blinked the blur out of my eyes, I realised I wasn’t alone.

Six figures. Armoured head to toe in matte black. No exposed skin. The helmets were sleek, more like fighter pilot helmets than anything I’d seen in real life, with a narrow T shaped visor glowing faintly blue. Their chest rigs were heavy with gear, spare mags, tools I didn’t recognise, coiled cables, what looked like a breaching charge. And slung in every set of black gloved hands… rifles that looked way more advanced than anything I’d ever seen in a gun store. Boxy, sharp edged, with chunky optics and glowing blue status strips along the receivers.

And every single one of those rifles was pointed at me.

I could just make out the patch on their shoulders: a white, stylised Greek letter A over the number 9. MTF Alpha-9.

I tried to speak but it came out as a croak.
“Where…?”

One of them moved, fast but controlled, stepping right into my personal space. I could see my reflection in their visor, pale and blood-smeared. The guy’s voice crackled into my half working ears.

“Site’s secure. You’re lucky you’re breathing. Now...” he leaned down just enough to be intimidating without breaking posture “ you’re gonna tell us exactly what went down.”

The others didn’t lower their weapons. Not an inch.

My head was pounding, every heartbeat a small explosion. “It’s… long story,” I muttered.

“We’ve got time,” he said. “Elevator ride’s long. Talk.”

So I did.

I told them about Phil. About Dana. About 173 in the hallway, 106 in the wall, the half cat, the researcher, the stairwell, the AI. I left nothing out. Every detail I could remember, from the gun Phil grabbed to the sound of 96 tearing itself apart.

At first, they just listened. Professional, still, the elevator’s hum filling the gaps when I had to pause and breathe. But as I went on, I saw the little things, a head tilt here, a shifting of stance there, that told me they were processing, maybe even doubting.

When I finished, the leader stood silent for a beat. Then...
“You’re saying you took down an active AI infestation and neutralised SCP 096.”

“I’m saying,” I replied, “I’m alive because something else did most of the work. I just… steered it.”

The visor was unreadable, but I swear I felt the weight of their gaze.

Finally, he straightened, and there was something almost like respect in his voice.
“You’re a liability,” he said. “But you’ve got instincts.”

Another soldier leaned in, his voice lower. “We could use someone who survives this kind of thing.”

My brain, still rattled from the eardrum damage, almost didn’t process what he was implying. “You’re… offering me a job?”

The leader tilted his head. “We don’t offer. We recruit.”

The elevator chimed. Doors slid open to blinding light at the end of a hallway.

And that’s when I realised...
For the first time since those blast doors slammed shut behind me… I was safe.

Two soldiers were half carrying, half dragging someone out of a side corridor.
I didn’t clock who it was at first, the guy looked like he’d been left in a ditch for a week. Clothes shredded to ribbons, boots half unlaced, skin pale under layers of dried sweat and grime. His hair was matted, his lips cracked.

Then he lifted his head just enough for me to see his face.

Phil.

But his eyes… his eyes were wrong. Not glowing, not monstrous, just wrong.
Like the part of him that used to belong entirely to the human race had been… negotiated away. Like he’d seen something so far outside anything people were built to process that a little piece of him hadn’t made the trip back.

He saw me, and for half a second, the faintest ghost of recognition flickered. He gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod. No smile. No words.

One of the soldiers turned their helmet toward me. Their voice came through the built in speaker, crisp, filtered, and without a shred of warmth.

“We need to check you for anomalous contamination.”

They marched us across the makeshift perimeter, through rows of armoured vehicles and glaring floodlights, to a medical tent big enough to service a small army. Inside, the air reeked of disinfectant and ozone. A folding table groaned under trays of syringes and sealed kits.

They made us strip down to our underwear, no arguments, no modesty curtain. A pair of techs in grey hazard suits started scanning us with something that looked like a cross between a metal detector and a cattle prod, a long, wand like device with an array of flickering lights along one side. Every time they passed it over a limb, it made a faint, insect like buzz.

Phil got extra scans. They did him twice. Three times. One of the techs kept glancing at his monitor, muttering something I couldn’t catch to the soldier beside him.

Then came the injections.

A tech held up a loaded syringe, and the soldier explained in the same clipped tone:

“Amnestics. You won’t remember a thing.”

Phil didn’t even flinch when they stuck the needle in his neck. His eyes glazed over instantly, his whole body sagging like someone had unplugged him. Two soldiers caught him before he hit the floor.

Mine hit slower. I didn’t black out, not completely. It was like trying to watch a movie through a smeared window, the volume turned way down. Shapes moved. Faces leaned over me. Someone’s voice droned questions I couldn’t process.

Then… darkness.

When I woke up, it was morning.
We were sitting in the front seats of our own delivery van, parked neatly in a layby not far from the depot Keys in the ignition.

On the dash, our work phone with just one entry:

JOB COMPLETE

Phil was in the passenger seat, fast asleep, head against the window.
I sat there for a long time, staring at that clipboard, trying to decide if I was dreaming or if reality had just decided it was done making sense.

That was last week.

Best I can figure, they must’ve screwed up the dosage on the amnestics they gave me, because instead of everything fading, more and more details keep bubbling up every day. Faces, voices, rooms, the sound of 96 screaming… it’s all still there. Clear as day.

Phil? Nothing. Not a flicker. He swears he doesn’t remember a thing past the start of the job. Honestly, that’s probably a blessing.

When we rolled back into the depot, it was like stepping out of a time machine. Georgie came running out of the office the second she saw us, nearly tackled me with a hug. Apparently, we’d been gone for seven days. Seven days, no radio contact, no tracker signal, no sign of the van.

First words out of Phil’s mouth?

“Do we get overtime for that?”

Adam’s voice boomed from the other side of the warehouse before Georgie could even answer.

“No!”

Georgie shot us both a grin when his back was turned and leaned in just enough to whisper,

“I’ll sort it.”

And that was that. No debrief. No missing persons report. No one asking the right questions.

So here I am, a week later, typing this all out for a bunch of strangers on the internet.
I don’t know if putting it down will help me forget, or make it impossible to.

Also we're getting straight back into work. No messing about at this place. Someone or something always needs a new washing machine. Apparently there's a big order coming in, as long as its not for the Foundation, I'm happy.

1msmbxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Chris-Crystal/comments/1msmbxk/about_me/,About Me,"By day Chris is a normal professional business man. He goes to the gym, dresses smart and everyone in the office looks up to him. He boasts about the big case he just signed, his new fancy car and the marathon he just ran.

At coffee break he talks about his time in the military, playing rugby and has everyone eating out of his hands. He’s confident, funny, well educated and the sort of bloke that will get on with everyone. 

He is your stereotypical man. Women have even been known to call him ‘a real man’ the office girls talk about his muscles, tattoos and in secret they talk about the size of his cock.

However when the sun sets, Chris has to fight the power within. It’s very easy for the transformation to begin. It almost happens without him knowing. He sits down and takes his pants off and goes to hypnotube or pmv heaven. 

And then without any warning the dominant Alpha male has been replaced with a sissy girl, who loves all things pink and girly. His mind empties out and is replaced with cotton candy and images of cocks.

Crystal is such a naughty cock zombie. Se dresses in pink panties and bra, white mini skirt and pink blouse. Her hair is blond and she loves to put it in pigtails with little bows.

Her boi hole becomes a pussy and her clitty is caged in pink plastic. It’s way too small to be used for anything other than the constant supply of tasty creamy wet goo. It’s like a yummy lube. 

Makeup is applied, and the old self has completely gone. She takes a sniff from the little brown bottle and bounces on the dildo. Adding copious amounts of lube. She bounces along with the girls on her screen, watching them suck and fuck. 

This is Crystal. I’m a whore nice to meet you. 
I’m a super hero and my super power is the ability to turn into a hot, smooth sexy gurl! Please keep this a secret, maybe you have a secret too? Want to play? 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩💕

1msm8sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1msm8sr/i_am_going_crazy_with_relationship_help/,I am going crazy with “relationship” help.,"Hi All, I need help with this girl caz I dont know what to do next.. I met her 6months ago, she opened up about traumas as soon as we started talking. Her ex passed away in traffic accident same day she broke up with her 6 years ago. And her mother died due to heart issues 3 years ago. She has panic attacks starting with Covid era. But she always says she had a perfect childhood and family no traumas from there. Overall she seemed very depressed and my empath personality started kick in and I started to make connection with her. She is very beautiful, smart, funny and has perfect painting skills which drew my attention. So little talks, reels turned into all night calls till mornings. It was all ONLINE. After a month I offered her to meet in person, she said she doesnt trust me enough. I gave her another month or two, but everytime she said she needs to be sure of our “relationship” before meeting for even coffee. Then we agreed to meet, two days before date we had fight over her best guy friend which I didnt like for several reasons. This was my hard boundary from last relationship, and I explained her u can meet now but if we advance I dont like best guy friends. She said I have to tolerate this he ll always be in our life. So I raised my voice, and she cancelled the meeting saying she is scared to meet me, I can do physical violence to her. Anyway I said okay, and continued to talk. Over these conversations she always had weird medical issues. Always complaining about having worst periods, hurting stomach, headaches, dizziness, falling onto floor and etc. It all looked like normal but until one day I realized it is too much, she never seems to be in normal mood always complaining and drama. We again agreed to meet but same week her grandmother passed away, and date cancelled again. She went into depressed mood for a few months, started seeing her old psychotherapist from panic attack times. Her diagnos was severe anxiety but I really doubt it. Caz she said her biggest phobia is losing the ones she really loves.. and this doesnt seem like only anxiety issue. Anyway I stopped offering for meeting in person waited for her to offer meeting but never did. She just continued to text and call, shared tons of photos with me which made me believe her authenticity at least existence. Even I offered to have videocall which she refused. So this weird continued from February till now. My work schedule is hard, and I am really bad at texting, so i naturally started giving breaks into texting and calls like every other days still calls but not as frequent as earlier. She met this with rage saying I am seeing somebody else, asked me exact date when I ll leave her which was putting pressure on me. Btw she is not working, her familys very rich so she has all the time in world. She threatened ending relationship 6-7 times saying it is over, too late for me fix sth but somehow we started talking again. Unfollowed me 2x times and started following again after talking to her. When I confront her, she says it is her defend mechanism, if she leaves first she ll be less hurt… Last time I gave 2-3 days before texting again, she sent this long messages I dont care about her, Im not good human and etc. She was meeting my small critisicm with anger, and was not settling down until I talk to her again for few hours and explain “myself”. And I finally said it is enough and ended relationship. She said she is recpecting my decision but lets have goodbye talk. Over the phone she sounded very sensitive saying it is my fault I dont text for 2 days, giving break and I give her breadcrumbs. But to me I always wanted to advance relationship, seemed like she controlled pace and felt comfortable over call, texting than meeting. She wanted to freeze instagram so she doesnt text me again, and I said dont do it again. All this looks me, bpd symptoms when I researched a lot,  it makes perfect sense but she never admitted saying therapist only said severe anxiety. 

Question is, what I do next? Should I give it another chance and offer her to meet? Or end the things as it is? My engineering logic says as I type it should be over, but want to get feedback, since she seems loyal, honest, funny when in normal mood. But when conflict happens I dont recognize her, it is like I need to give her all explanations and truth until she calms down.

This is driving me crazy, please help… There are other points too, I can share if u ask me, I think I already shared enough.",1,1755422085.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False
1msm8sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1msm8sq/moving_day_disaster_and_everything_still_at_our/,"Moving day disaster and everything still at our previous flat, what would you do?","My husband and I recently moved(?) from London to Scotland. We got a man & van from Shiply as we mostly have boxed stuff, it was a 2-man team with nothing but positive reviews. Seemed very genuine, diverse writing styles and level of detail etc. Communication before move was great, I paid the deposit and Shiply's service fee. We booked the sleeper train to Scotland for ourselves.

Evening of move we get a message saying the mover's wife is heavily pregnant and had to be rushed to a hospital, so the move next day would be delayed a few hours. Understandable that emergencies happen, so we wish his wife a speedy recovery and okay the delay. We did have a parking bay suspension, end of tenancy cleaning, and daycare for our dog booked for early in the morning, but we manage to sort everything by pulling an all-nighter frantically rearranging things and doing all the cleaning we can ourselves. 

Next morning we hear the wife is doing worse and the mover still has to find childcare, so he can't make it in the afternoon either, but really wants to find a solution that works for us. My husband calls him, he is very apologetic about it all and suggests we go to Scotland, but leave a key to a neighbor who can let him in in the morning and he can complete the move. We suggest a later date with me or my husband traveling back from Scotland to oversee the process, as we still have a few weeks until the tenancy ends. Mover insists he can do it in the morning so we don't have to do an additional trip, it's the least he can do for us. Husband and I are sleep deprived and beyond exhausted at this point and neither of us wants to see the old flat ever again or start sorting out another moving company, probably paying thousands extra in the process etc. We say that's fine, ask our landlady to let him in, gather all belongings of significant value, and hop on the night train.

Morning in the train, we wake up to a message saying the mover still can't make it. The house we bought is lovely at least, and it's a beautiful day! We spend the first day finding necessary items as most of what we need is still in our old flat, and we're in a fairly rural location with slow delivery options. We figure we'll cut our losses with Shiply and think about another moving company once we have kibble for our dog, mugs to make instant coffee, and more than 2 pairs of socks each.

However, mover is now saying he could complete the move on Tuesday if our landlady lets him in to get our stuff. We aren't optimistic that it's going to work out after so many cancellations, but of course assuming the story is true, it's entirely understandable that trying to sort out childcare and a long drive across the country is not going to be an easy task, not to mention the emotional stress. Payment is on delivery, so I'm not that worried that he would just run off with our stuff - if resold, our belongings probably wouldn't be worth much more than what we'd pay him. Mostly I'm worried that he'll get delayed when in possession of our items, which include a lot of sentimentally important stuff, so a lot of additional stress.

So maybe we should just find someone else at this point. But while this wasn't the cheapest quote we got on Shiply as we prioritized review history, it's still much cheaper than standard moving companies, so getting one of the latter we'd be spending thousands on top of the non-refundable Shiply fee, and who knows if we get the deposit back (I think the mover would have to agree to the cancellation for us to get it back?). We can sort of afford it, but it'd be a big chunk of our savings, and there are lots of forthcoming expenses being first-time homeowners. Should we give him a 4th chance just in case it will be sorted, or just resign to more effort and money to get a well known company? We are still a bit too sleep deprived to think things through. One of us could also travel there to get a few irreplaceable items out of the boxes before sending the rest off with this guy lol.",1,1755422085.0,HousingUK,7,0.67,False

My experience & some questions I got on the day,"I passed my Life in the UK test yesterday — hooray! 🎉 One step closer… now just the long 7 month wait (& stress about potential ILR rule changes…) until I can actually submit the application (SWV route). 😬

About the experience —- 

Arrived 45 mins early, wasn’t too crowded (three other people taking the test at the same time & a few more coming and going). Test centre staff were all nice & efficient and most of the staff seemed to be immigrants too, which was kind of comforting. 🙂

I used my eVisa share code to register & brought a print out of the share code and eVisa pages - plus passport and expired BRP card just in case. They only looked at my share code printout and passport (to verify signature). They asked that I turn my phone off and put my things in a locker, did the quick security scan, then let me take the test early — I was actually in and out of there before my scheduled test time!

Test took about 15 minutes, and that’s with double checking all my answers and going fairly slowly. Had my email saying I passed before I even left the building; huge relief! Went and got myself an iced coffee as a treat since I was so ahead of schedule haha. 


I can’t remember all the questions I ended up getting on the day, but most covered similar topics from the official online tests. 

To study, I read the book, hand-wrote study cards for each section of the book, quizzed myself on the study cards, and used the official study app to take a bunch of practice tests. I felt well prepared walking in. 


Some of the question topics that I can remember:

Who printed the first books using a printing press in the UK?

Are arranged marriages acceptable if both parties agree? 

When did Jesus die?

Charles II question

Shakespeare question 

Conan Doyle question 

Question about Scottish courts 

What percent of the uk workforce is made up of women?

When could both men and women vote at the age of 21?

Question about the Channel Islands - crown dependency or British overseas territory

What is a shadow cabinet 

What is the National Citizen Service 

Question about principles and values of the UK 

Question about Hadrian’s Wall

Chapter 16.

“Ok, Blue-boy, time to earn your keep,” said Willy, handing Nirales the cylindrical sensor storage.

“Again with the ‘Blue-boy’,” he muttered in frustration, holding the meter-long cylinder with both arms.

Ivko and Willy had roped Nirales into what was, in essence, an unnecessary and overly convoluted routine check. The z-point drive’s containment cradles were —as with all GC tech— extremely well-thought-out pieces of machinery, requiring little to no maintenance. And even if they did, the shipyards were always just one jump away, so repairs were always within reach.

However, since they’d soon be traveling beyond GC boundaries, no amount of double-checking felt like too much.

They went up the stairs to the upper deck. On the curved wall of the ship’s circular upper junction, Willy opened the access panel to the core’s emergency port. After inputting the access code, a circular hatch opened like a seamless iris. Through it, they could see —suspended within its containment cradle— the zero-point drive: a bright sphere that pulsed with harmless static electricity discharges.

“Ok, in we go,” said Willy. “Safety first, though —goggles on.”

The two humans put on matching polarized safety goggles, while Nirales just stared at them in bright red horror.

“I’m not going in there,” he said flatly.

“What, you don’t want to be cool like us?” said Willy mockingly. “Come on, it’s just some highly ionized gamma radiation —what’s the worst that could happen?”

Nirales just stood there, visual nodes jumping from one human to the other, while his bioluminescent patches still shone the brightest red imaginable.

“There’s no radiation other than light and some static electricity —harmless to us,” explained Ivko, placing Nirales’ tailor-made goggles on his head. “We’re going to place these sensors along the surface of the core to get a full z-point profile image of the reactor. You’ll be completely safe.”

The oakarat, still cradling the cylinder with his boneless arms, looked at them through his goggles, his face tentacles cringing inwardly in frustration.

“Come on, man. You’re gonna love it,” said Willy, and dove feet first through the access port.

Ivko followed him, leaving Nirales standing in the hallway, holding the cylinder and feeling like an absolute fool.

With a sigh of resignation, he approached the port. The light of the core shone through with blinding radiance, but the adaptive glass of the goggles compensated for the intensity.

“Pass the cylinder,” said Ivko from inside.

Nirales obeyed, and shortly after, mustered the courage to go through the port.

He landed noiselessly on the core —not the bottom of the cradle, as logic would dictate, but the core itself. Long had Nirales pondered how the ship generated its artificial gravity, and now, standing on this strange and truly alien sphere, he felt as if he’d been handed a piece of an unfathomably complex puzzle.

The object pulled at him with the same gravity he was used to. But while aboard the ship that force had always felt natural, even logical, here —on this “tiny” planetoid-looking thing— a wave of disorientation hit him like a tidal wave.

He dropped on all fours, dizzy from the weirdness of it all.

“Poor guy,” said Willy, walking over to him. “He must be tripping balls right about now.”

Willy helped him up while Ivko placed the cylinder upright, dropping the first sensor on the orb.

“How can this even be…” managed to stammer Nirales, his blue hidden by the radiance of the orb.

Through the polarized goggles, the core looked like a miniaturized sun —spots of lower intensity blending into those of higher in a constant ebb and flow.

“Just think of it as magic,” said Ivko, placing the second sensor a bit further, following the virtual grid displayed in his goggles —a grid that had appeared after placing the first sensor.

Nirales stood up and looked toward the port they had come through. If he stretched his arms, he could just about reach it. Knowing he could leave with relative ease at any time helped alleviate the existential dread that had overtaken him just a minute earlier.

Willy observed the energy output map that the sensors were slowly generating, while Ivko placed them with the utmost care.

They worked in silence for almost an hour, until the entire surface of the core was covered in equally spaced sensors.

“Okay,” said Ivko. “Easy part’s done. Now for the tricky part.”

The two humans looked at the readings on a large screen —an upsized version of the standard PIT, capable of higher processing power. With careful observation and analysis, they painstakingly established the outline of the core’s output projection —averaging its peaks and valleys, accounting for outlines, and leaving nothing to chance.

“Are you going to fill me in on what it is you’re doing?” asked Nirales, fear and confusion giving way to bordun.

Ivko lifted one finger, asking for a moment longer of silence, before typing in a sequence of numbers and, without looking at him, answered:

“Looking for possible micro-flaws in the core’s precipitation matrix,” his words were slow and deliberate, weighed down by the calculations still going through his head.

Nirales, having learned nothing from the answer, decided to wait a bit longer, hoping that some clarification would ensue. And as he expected, Ivko continued:

“These cores are a pretty common thing in GC space, made exactly the same way by the exact same means since God knows when,” he began. “You can spend an entire lifetime studying one for flaws and find none. But every so often, one may be created with a mild imperfection that could, long-term, cascade into a catastrophic system collapse.”

“What are the consequences of those collapses?” he inquired.

“Best case scenario,” chimed in Willy, “the core explodes, taking its crew with it —and whatever planet it happens to be near.”

“And worst case?”

“A new black hole is formed,” said Ivko dryly.

Nirales went weak in the knees, losing balance for an instant.

“As far as we know, it happened only twice in GC history —which arguably isn’t much, but it’s enough to warrant a good in-depth study of every cubic centimeter of the core,” explained Ivko.

“So, we’re going to spend the whole night here, eyes glued to this screen, searching for the slightest sign of structural instability, unaccounted-for energy spikes, and unwanted grav-wave fluctuations,” explained Willy. “You can leave whenever you want, although you should stay with us. Spending a night atop a z-point core is something of a rite of passage among us.”

Nirales looked at them with uncertainty. On one hand, he wanted to get the hell out of this weird place —but on the other, he *did* want to earn their respect, or at least a bit of it.

“I’ll stay… but I’m not sleeping here, though.”

“Who said anything about sleeping?” said Willy.

\*\*\*

Angela woke up earlier than usual. She’d been having the weirdest series of dreams and hadn’t gotten a proper night’s rest. Rather than trying to sleep some more and risk oversleeping, she got up, choosing to have an early start to the day.

After splashing some water on her face and getting dressed, she went into the mess hall, where Neryh was making breakfast. Remembering last night’s conversation, she couldn’t help but blush a little when she saw him. He was wearing his usual simple work attire —light brown pants and a dark, form-fitting shirt with two pairs of sleeves for his four arms — and was diligently preparing everyone’s meal.

She cleared her throat before sitting down at the table, and he turned his head to look at her. He greeted her with his charming half-smile, and she blushed again —this time, a tad deeper.

“Well, well!” he said. “Someone got up early today. Couldn’t sleep?”

“Something like that,” she answered, stretching both arms over the table. “I sometimes have weird dreams that leave me exhausted.”

“We call those dreams the Epilogue Battles,” he said as he walked over to her with a mug of coffee and a small clay pitcher of warm milk. “After a day’s battle, unresolved issues would linger in our minds. And if you didn’t know how to deal with them, they’d steal your next day too.”

She thanked him for the coffee, and he returned to the proverbial fires.

“Bear in mind, when I say battles, I don’t mean literal ones —although the expression did originate on the battlefield. It’s more about the daily kind.”

He made eggy ChloroNutra bread, caramelized fanura cheese for Navrek, some dried fish strips for Kana, and a universal form of vat-grown fried fatty meat for the rest. He laid the dishes on the table and sat across from Angela.

“There’s also another issue that may cause restlessness at night, which is lucid dreaming,” he continued, sipping from his coffee mug. “When we go out of our way to try and control what happens in our dreams, we defeat the purpose of dreaming —i.e., letting our brain relax and filter out the accumulated waste.”

Angela looked at him thoughtfully.

“You know, you might be onto something,” she said, leaning forward. “I sometimes do try to direct the flow of my dreams.”

“Really, it’s more about relaxing,” he went on. “CTS demands a balance of both imposing control and relinquishing it. Thankfully, I managed to get it under control when I sleep. The rest of the time though…”

He trailed off, his voice still tinged with a bit of shame at his failings as a navigator.

Suddenly, Nirales exited his room. His feet were dragging, and since his limbs had no bones to speak of, his gait when tired was both fascinating and hilarious to watch. He gave a big yawn —which, for him, meant spreading his facial tentacles and stretching open his beak. When he saw he wasn’t alone, he quickly rushed to close everything up, glowing a bright, embarrassed yellow.

“I apologize for that,” he said, waddling over to the table as Neryh brought him his mug.

“I see you’re not the only one who had a rough night,” said the Kaelarun, nodding toward Angela.

Nirales just looked at him, visual nodes somehow narrowing in a pitiful stare.

“Ivko and Willy had me up almost all night doing some engine checks,” he explained, dipping his tentacles into his mug. “I couldn’t stay the whole night there, just staring at streams of data I couldn’t even begin to understand.”

He sounded sorry, as if he had failed a simple job they’d asked of him.

“They can be such dicks sometimes,” said Angela with a dry chuckle. “It’s not your fault you couldn’t keep up. They had Tuyaara make them some stimulants to keep them sharp all night.”

He looked at her, utterly incredulous.

“Yeah, don’t feel bad,” said Neryh. “Even by our standards, they’re a bit weird. The Order demands excellence, sure, but they take it to the extreme.”

“I wouldn’t be surprised if they actually stayed in the core during transit,” said Angela, checking her PIT and realizing they were, in fact, in the Axios cluster. “Yup, they stayed there while the core powered up.”

“As I said, that isn’t normal behavior,” reiterated Neryh.

Tuyaara came out of her room wearing a tight set of dark leggings and a long-sleeved shirt —zipper strategically lowered a quarter of the way down, revealing a bit of cleavage. She walked over to one of the cabinets, took out a mug, and poured herself some coffee.

“At least *you* don’t look tired,” said Angela, as the doctor sat at the table.

Tuyaara looked at her and the Oakarat, noticing their tired demeanor.

“I get him, but why are *you* tired?” she asked, pointing at Angela.

“Weird dreams,” she said.

Tuyaara gave a quick sidelong glance at Neryh and then back to her.

“Weird, yeah, let’s call it that,” she said with a coy smile.

Angela just stared at her —eyes wide open— silently mouthing her to drop the matter. The doctor did so, hiding a grin behind her coffee mug.

They then heard two sets of heavy feet stumbling down the stairs, accompanied by a chorus of grunts and choked moans of pain.

Ivko and Willy had returned —and they looked like hammered shit.

Willy’s right arm hung limp at his side, while half of Ivko’s face was swollen. They were both limping, using one another for support. Somehow, they were still holding on to their gear —although barely.

“We returned triumphant,” said Willy, while Ivko just nodded, not particularly able to talk.

“Well, at least I don’t feel so bad for ditching you guys last night,” said Nirales, visibly happier.

“I’ll prep the med-bay,” said Tuyaara with a resigned sigh.

“Great, we’ll just have a quick bite to eat and—” began Willy, before the doctor snapped at him.

“Med-bay. Both of you. NOW!”

They both looked at one another and shrugged, understanding they somehow had it coming, and followed her.

“I’m missing some key context here —how did they end up so beaten up?” inquired Nirales.

“I’m no engineer, so I can’t explain the exact why, just the what,” began Angela. “The core, when not activated, still emits the basic gravity field it distributes throughout the ship, powering everything else with the electrical byproduct it generates by just… you know, existing.”

She paused to make sure he could follow.

“Now, when it turns on and initiates the transit from point A to point B, it begins to spin… more or less. It’s not so much that it spins around its axis creating centrifugal force, but rather that it creates a contained gravity field between itself and the cradle… again, no clue how.” She paused, herself confused by the process. “Anyway, as I said, it’s complicated. So to cut a long story short: if something happens to be crazy or stupid enough to find itself on top of it, it will end up orbiting the core.”

“Add to that possible gravity-induced time dilations, and those two could’ve been there for quite a while, just orbiting the core at almost break-neck speeds,” added Neryh. “All of their injuries were probably due to smashing against the cradle itself upon the end of transit —or against one another. Either way, they’re lucky to be alive.”

Nirales didn’t even react. A part of him believed he couldn’t be surprised anymore, and his lack of reaction to this particular piece of news all but confirmed it.

Meanwhile, in the med-bay, Willy was sitting in the chair while Tuyaara inspected his injuries.

“You’ve shattered your collarbone and sprained pretty much your entire right leg,” she said, in her usual clinical and calm manner. “The leg has an easy fix. The collarbone, though…” She raised an eyebrow and walked over to one of her dispensers. “We’re going to need some nanites for that.”

She transferred the biometric data from the medical scan into one of the dispensers, and after a couple of seconds, placed a small glass vial into a groove in the machine. A light blue substance began pouring in.

“And because you seem to have total disregard for your own well-being, you’re going to raw-dog the process,” she said with an wicked grin. “Yes, that means no anesthetics. You want to fuck around? Well, now you get to find out.”

Willy looked at her in horror and was about to protest, when Ivko limped over to his side and, placing a reassuring hand on his uninjured shoulder, gave him a solemn nod.

“*Per aspera, ad astra*,” he managed to say through swollen lips and what looked like a broken jaw.

“You’re right, brother,” answered Willy, anticipation dripping from his voice. “Go ahead, doc. I’m ready for the worst.”

Tuyaara just looked at them and sighed, not really knowing what she had expected. If they were willing to risk snapping their necks inside the core for little more than shits and giggles, it stood to reason they wouldn’t call her bluff —not even flinch at the idea of going through a nanite treatment without anesthetics.

“Okay, I was joking. I’ll give you some anesthetics,” she hurried to say, a bit horrified at their willingness to go through with it.

“No need, doc,” said Willy, pride, and anticipation palpable in his demeanor.

She looked at him, then at Ivko. Both men just stared back, determination plastered on their faces. With little left to do, she simply placed the vial into a standard applicator and injected it into Willy’s neck. The man braced for what was to come.

As the nanite solution made its way to the affected area, a growing discomfort spread through him —mild and tolerable at first, but soon after, the real agony began.

Willy’s jaw clenched in pain as the nanites began knitting the shattered bone, forcing the production of artificial osteoblasts —all while the exposed nerves were being agitated from beneath the skin.

Ivko locked grips with him in support. He began humming a tune —steady and melodic. He repeated it over and over, louder and louder, until Willy, through his agony, began chanting along.

“*Semper procedimus! Nullus retro!*”

“*Semper procedimus! Nullus retro!*”

He repeated it over and over, while Ivko just hummed, until, a couple of minutes later, the pain began to subside as the last fragments of the bone settled back into place, the exogenous substance fusing with the bone.

Tuyaara’s astonishment at their resolve left her utterly speechless.

As Willy stood up, Ivko patted him encouragingly on the back.

“Man, that hurt like a motherfucker!” he said, laughing as he rolled his freshly mended shoulder.

Ivko took his place, and Tuyaara wasted no time in starting her treatment.

“My God,” she muttered, looking at the multiple fractures on his left cheekbone and jaw, and the numerous sprained tendons along his legs. “You idiots are lucky to be alive.”

“We idiots got a full in-depth diagnostic on the ship’s core —at rest and while active—, and can say with full and absolute confidence that it will never blow up into a black hole.”

Willy’s words carried the confidence of someone who knew the value of his work and the importance of self-sacrifice. There was no shame or regret —just a clear conscience at a job well done.

Tuyaara shook her head, both angry at their recklessness and proud of their selflessness.

As she keyed in Ivko’s biometric parameters into the cymatics resonator, she began mending the damaged tendons in his legs.

“All this damage and not a single broken bone,” she muttered, inwardly gushing at the man’s resilience.

“My boy is a beast!” exclaimed Willy, hyping Ivko up and locking grips with him, this time with his recently mended arm.

Ivko just gave a half-smile and nodded as they increased the strength of their respective grips.

“Cut it out,” she said, finishing up his legs and moving on to his face. “Why don’t you wait outside—or better still, go get some breakfast for the two of you.”

“Damn good idea, doc,” he said and went to the exit.

Tuyaara smiled inwardly at their potential alone time, glad to have the chance to care for him. Through the med scanners, she saw the hairline fractures—like webs on his cheekbone.

She was shocked to realize he didn’t have a concussion —something she should have noticed earlier, but his lucidity and presence of mind had made her miss it completely.

*Just how tough was he*, she wondered.

With a gentle touch, she inspected every centimeter of his face, gathering the necessary data to program into the nanites. Once that was done, she repeated the same process she had used with Willy, intending this time to actually give him a sedative.

However, when she prepared the aerosolized anesthetic, Ivko stopped her from using it on him.

“Don’t be an idiot, you saw what he went through,” she scolded him — and yet, he insisted on having none.

“You’ve got nothing to prove to anyone. We all know how tough you are…”

“It’s not about proof,” he managed to stammer, every word an agony. “It’s a matter of principles.”

She wanted to do it anyway, his principles be damned. She wouldn’t watch him suffer like that.

And yet, the calm in his gaze spoke louder than any word he could have uttered.

“Very well,” she relented.

When the nanite solution was prepped, she injected it into his neck and waited for it to take effect.

And just like that, the painful process began. Through clenched teeth and shut eyes —a gesture that only worsened the already painful injuries—, the nanites began mending the bones, while Tuyaara applied the cymatics resonator to reduce the swelling, slowly returning his face back to normal.

After the ordeal, he remained seated, panting and covered in sweat. He looked at her and gave her a wide, charming smile —under which she tried not to melt.

“Thanks, doc. Much better,” he said, slowly sitting up and opening and closing his jaw.

“You know it’s a miracle you don’t have a concussion, right?” she said, not even trying to hide her concern.

“I don’t get those,” he answered matter-of-factly.

“What do you mean, you don’t get those?” she asked, clearly annoyed by the bravado. “We’re not talking about immunity to a virus or pathogen —this is a physical condition. It’s like telling me you’re immune to amputations.”

“I don’t know how it works. It’s something in my genes. Somehow, they keep my brain from shutting off upon impact,” he said, voice neutral. “It runs in my family. You can do a full genetic sequencing if you want.”

“I may just do that.”

\*\*\*

“Bullshit!” exclaimed Willy, incredulous.

“I’m telling you the truth,” said Neryh. “He took part in over three hundred duels and never lost.”

“I presume there were records of his victories — or were they just hearsay?” inquired Ivko, still working on the schematics of Kana’s UV filters at his workbench.

“Because we have a guy who, according to some historical records, defeated close to six hundred enemies in single combat.”

“Who the hell was that?” asked Willy, genuinely confused.

“György Thury, the sixteenth-century Hungarian hero,” he said.

“Aahh, that guy,” said Willy, remembering. “Yeah, the records of his feats were sketchy at best. Nevertheless, if only half of what he did was true, then yes, we can match your Isrum Nebo.”

“Wait, you said six hundred?” exclaimed Neryh.

“Yes, but not in tournaments with judges and flags — rather individual combats, many of them formal challenges, fought one-on-one during real military campaigns,” explained Ivko. “So, yes, if even half of his victories are true, then we’re still tied.”

Ivko, Willy, and Neryh were spending the afternoon debating military feats from their respective species, discovering that the kaelarun’s history of military aristocracy was being matched, feat by feat, by random human accomplishments.

“Alright then —best marksman,” said Neryh. “Reev the Shadow. Four hundred and fifty confirmed kills, and using iron sights.”

“What war was he in?” inquired Willy.

“The Great Unification Wars, on the side of the Northern Alliance,” he answered.

“Not bad, not bad,” said Willy, thinking of a human counterpart. “I’d say Simo Häyhä, but most of his kills were scored against dipshit recruits without proper winter camo —easy pickings, basically. Nothing like that meat grinder of yours.”

“How many did he kill?”

“Five hundred and five, also using iron sights. He killed more with submachine guns, but we’re not counting those,” said Willy.

“We could also count Francis Pegahmagabow,” chimed in Ivko. “Our Great War was similar to their Great Unification War —industrialized, with trenches and brutal losses.”

“Yeah, but he killed around three hundred, so they got us beat by a lot.”

“Was this Häyhä fellow, by any chance, the one you called The White Death?” asked Neryh.

“Yes,” answered Willy.

“Then we tie again,” he replied, with growing frustration, remembering what he’d read about the Finnish sniper. “Actually, no. That point goes to you, since he died of old age —and was shot in the face.”

“The Shadow didn’t?”

“No, he died in combat.”

“Well, who’s next then?” asked Willy. “Craziest military leader? We’ve done ‘best’ already.”

“Sure, why not.” Neryh thought for an instant. “King Ruhnir the Lucky.”

The two humans looked up at him, the name ringing no bells.

“He was a bit of a nobody until he managed to win battle after battle by nothing but pure accident. Such was his luck, that one day, he forgot the agreed-upon date for a specific battle, and when the time came, his enemies were so confused they thought it was part of a wild strategy, and eventually ended up surrendering. I’m glossing over a lot of key context, but the gist is that he founded the basis of what became the Kirh Empire —our dominant civilization. He died from a heart attack —from the stress of what he understood as ‘his unearned fame’. For additional fun facts, he also went bald.”

“How is that funny?” asked Willy.

“We don’t go bald, not even under a lot of stress. Matter of fact, the amount of stress a kaelarun would have to go through to go bald would have stopped his heart sooner than that. So, when, upon his death, his advisors found his journal and read the truth about his triumphs —a series of ramblings about how fucked he was, and how his luck would run out this time for sure— their surprise was immense, to say the least.”

“And how was he the craziest?” asked Willy.

“You don’t find that crazy?”

“Sure, but I was thinking more in the line of insane —like a mad genius.”

“I see,” said the kaelarun. “In that case, I don’t think we had anyone that would fit those parameters, or none that I can recall.”

“Still, that one was pretty fucked. Imagine coasting through life on luck alone, fearing every day it will run out,” said Willy, looking him up on his PIT.

“Well, my pick for humanity’s representative for the category of craziest military leader would have to be General Adrian Carton de Wiart —or better known as the Unkillable Soldier,” said Ivko.

“Ha! The fucking Lich King himself,” said Willy with a chuckle.

“Unkillable?”

“He lost a piece of himself on every battlefield he fought —a testicle, an eye, a hand, a piece of his head… By the time he reached old age, he was more lead than man,” explained Ivko. “His soldiers were both terrified of him and inspired by him. He looked like a walking corpse, and was the first one to jump into the fray. He had no regard for his own life. None whatsoever.”

“He makes us look like hypochondriacs in comparison,” explained Willy.

“The best part was that he met face to face with humanity’s worst mass murderer —or maybe second worst— and told him, in front of his court, that he, and his ideology, were nothing but a pile of shit. I’m paraphrasing here, so don’t quote me on that,” said Ivko.

“And he survived several plane crashes,” added Willy.

Neryh checked on his PIT and laughed when he saw the pictures of this crooked-looking, wiry old man.

“Dear God, what a ghostly-looking fellow!”

“I would also add Blas de Lezo, the Half-Man, but he wasn’t so much mad as just blown to bits,” added Willy. “He was actually pretty straightforward. I guess I was thinking about maimed leaders and he came to mind.”

Suddenly, Angela walked into the shuttle bay, followed by Aguija. The taftid seemed to be on edge, looking around nervously, yet there was also a hint of enthusiasm in her eyes.

“Hey guys,” greeted Angela, chipper as ever. “Look who I ran into.”

The men waved curiously at her, trying to appear as non-threatening as possible.

“Hello,” she said, excitement and apprehension mixed in her voice.

“So, what were you knuckleheads talking about?” asked Angela.

“Just some comparative history,” said Neryh.

“I see. Who’s warriors had the bigger set of balls, and all that, right?” she answered mockingly.

“You know it!” said Willy. “And humanity still rules, baby!”

“The fuck it does,” protested Neryh. “You just so happened to have a couple of worthy fighters at specific points in your history that warp the statistical truth of the matter.”

“Which is?” inquired Ivko.

“You got lucky. Like King Ruhnir,” he said.

“Bitch, please. Just because we spent the last couple of centuries on Terra fighting only mild proxy wars doesn’t mean we lost our warrior fervor,” protested Willy. “We were just held back by the shadowy organizations that ruled our societies from behind the scenes.”

“You got manipulated so easily because you lacked the stomach to do what was right and assassinate them when they were still weak,” barked Neryh.

“Gentlemen,” said Ivko, raising his voice over the argument. “Debating will get us nowhere. How about we settle this like civilized men —not with empty words, but with full fists.”

“What an excellent idea,” said Willy, cracking his knuckles.

The kaelarun looked at the human with mild discomfort. Despite the former’s physical bulk and greater reach, he couldn’t hold a candle to the latter’s sheer brute force and equally brutal conditioning.

“The worst that could happen is you spend a couple of minutes with the good doctor,” taunted Willy. “Come on, your grace, where’s that combat prowess your people like to brag about so much? Where’s all that military aristocracy?”

Angela looked at them, eyes narrowed, arms crossed.

“Stop trying to put on a show for the poor girl,” she said, pointing at Aguija —her face utterly crimson with fear.

“You got me,” said Willy, raising his arms and laughing loudly. “I thought we could put on a show for her. What’s the point of having a bunch of rowdy Deathworlders if you don’t have them fighting every now and then?”

Neryh sighed, relieved not to have to go through with the fight.

“You had me there for a second,” said the taftid, her healthy pallor returning to her face. “I thought you were really going to fight.”

“Aww, she’s just adorable,” said Willy, smiling at her. “We tend to forget that not all taftids are as tough as the Cap.”

“He wasn’t always the fearless daredevil we know and love. He used to be timid and skittish,” said Angela, both mockingly and with the intent of hyping him up in front of her.

While they chatted, Ivko placed the final touches on the design of Kana’s UV filters.

“Well, that’s done,” he muttered, and called her over his PIT.

Willy walked over to the workbench to check the design.

“Nice,” he said, inspecting the hologram in detail. “I thought you were going to make it more ostentatious, but this looks amazing.”

“Thanks,” Ivko said, making the display spin with a flick of his finger. “I think she’ll like it.”

“It’ll go well with the compact UV meter I made for her,” Willy added.

“Are you going to show it to me?” asked Ivko.

“Nah, it’ll be a surprise for all,” he said with a wicked grin.

Kana came into the shuttle bay at a brisk pace, train fluttering and tail swaying side to side.

“I came as fast as I could,” she said. “What’s up?”

Ivko showed her the finalized design, enhancing the display so that she could get a good look at it.

The filter looked like a diadem —internal circuitry encased in a light polymer casing of matte dark grey—, with the filter array protruding along its surface like an arrangement of big square rubies.

“What do you think? You like it?” he asked.

“It’s beautiful!” she said excitedly, dumbstruck at the display. “I thought it would be bigger —you know, more cumbersome.”

“The ones you might’ve seen out there are the result of crappy craftsmanship,” he explained. “This is efficiency manifest. And the colors match yours, so it doesn’t clash.”

“I love it,” she said, giving him a big hug.

He gave her a half-hearted hug back, saying,

“Don’t thank me yet —we’ve still got to put this thing together.”

He stared at the design for a second while she let go of him.

“Meanwhile, I have this for you,” said Willy, handing her a small box. “It’s a UV meter that will warn you if the ambient amount exceeds healthy parameters.”

She opened the box with enthusiasm and extracted a pendant with a small holo-locket. Upon activating it, a cartoon image appeared.

“What… who’s this supposed to be?” asked Kana, confused.

They all gathered to look at the strange picture: it was a cartoon version of Kana, but with exaggerated features —bigger eyes, a bushier train, and larger breasts— smiling while winking.

“I don’t get it,” she said. “Who’s that supposed to be?”

“Well, you, of course,” he explained, smiling like an idiot. “See, this is a form of art we humans refer to as anime.”

Ivko and Angela rolled their eyes while trying to stifle a laugh. Seeing their imminent outburst, Willy shushed them, not wanting them to ruin the moment.

“You see, this form of art has a long and rich history, on top of great emotional value,” he explained, obviously joking —though you wouldn’t be able to tell by the tone alone. “This specific depiction of yourself represents your chipper personality and affable nature.”

“I see that, but why are her breasts so big? Mine certainly aren’t,” she said, clearly confused.

“It’s a symbol of feminine vigor and exuberance,” he explained. “All female depictions in this art form have large breasts. Think of it as part of the style.”

Kana held the pendant in front of her, inspecting the hologram, trying to understand his explanation.

“And here’s the fun part,” Willy resumed explaining. “See, whenever it’s in this configuration, the UV concentration is within acceptable parameters. But if the ambient levels of UV increase…”

He dimmed the ambient lights and shone his flashlight in a blue light frequency. Cartoon Kana instantly turned displeased—pouting, train down, and eyes narrowed.

“And if we increase the frequency over to pure UV…” He did so, and the cartoon gained a visibly pained expression, shielding her face from the source of light with an open grimace. “Once we synchronize it with the filter, there will also be some sound effects.”

Ivko began to slow clap.

“Man, you’ve outdone yourself,” he said, shaking his head.

“I think it’s starting to grow on me,” said Kana, as the lights returned to normal. “Thanks, Willy. It’s beautiful.”

“You’re very welcome.”

When viewed in such lenses, the RTS genre is dieing or already dead. 

But the RTS genre was never supposed to be a product behemoth. RTS is more of a cottage and craftsman industry. Where small teams or singular developers craft bespoke experiences. They made games they’d enjoy, and other’s enjoyment is just a secondary objective.

RTS enjoyers are niche. I would argue that the amount of RTS players never really decreased. Its just that videogames have begun to appeal to more and more people that RTS players in proportion looked tiny. If you are a businessman hoping that RTS genre would keep apace, seeing the ratios will make you think that it’s a poor sector to invest in. But if you acknowledge that it’s a niche industry, then you will see that it is doing fine and healthily even today, and in the past few years for that matter.

Some would lament that the genre doesn’t feel the same anymore as newer titles are derivative rather than pushing the boundaries. That’s because they would only ever acknowledge games that came into the industry radar. And oftentimes these RTS titles are aiming for maximum profit, and often seen trying to appeal to the majority. However, if you acknowledge the genre as a cottage industry, and start really digging and searching for it, you will find titles almost every year attempting something new and innovative. 

Stop expecting that intricate artisan beverage to evolve into the next soda that everyone loves. Treat it as a rarity, with no standardization, and you will begin to find the joy in the various flavours produced by obscure and hidden artisans.
We should stop using Starcraft and AoE as the benchmarks. They are the outliers. They are the coffee blends that started to take the world by storm. But by measuring every other RTS to match them, then you will preclude yourselves from experiencing the hidden and the sublime. 

Here are some blends I’d recommend if you’d want to have a taste exploration:

AI war series, Tooth and Tail, Line War, Offworld Trading Company, Infested Planet, Empires of the Undergrowth, Conflicks: Revolutionary Space Battles, Ancestors Legacy, Airships Conquer the Skies, Cataclysmo, Convoy, Diplomacy is not an Option, Five Nations, Nebulous: Fleet Command, Cataclismo, Winter Falling.

I have two jobs at the moment: a week job, and a week-end job. Week-end job requires me to spend early mornings at an office building that is opened 24/7. That's not how I would have loved to spend my sunday mornings during summer, but I make it work.

After a particulary rough week (deadlines, tensions between co-workers, trouble sleeping), I was not looking forward to go work on the week-end. So to cheer myself up, I decided to do a full Chief Wiggum routine, by getting a donut and a coffee on the way. There is a donut place near the train station (I take the subway). I go there, and ask for a large coffee and two donuts (one for me, one for the security guy at the office because he offered me some sweets the other day). The guy gave me the donuts and made me pay while preparing the coffee. He then handed me the coffee like ""here you go"", but it was just the coffee without a lid. I asked him if I could have one. He looked at me, silent, then took a lid that was too big and put it on the cup. I was like ""Oh don't you have one that is the right size?"" And he just looked at me not saying anything.

  
Now look, I've worked food-stand jobs and I know it can be hard and unfair. Probably they were out of the right type of lids and would not receive some until Monday. That's okay. But I could not take the subway and walk for 10 minutes with my bag, a box of donuts and a coffee without putting coffee everywhere. So I told the guy ""Then I'm sorry I can't take the coffee, I need to get on the train."" He said ""Well, can't you just chug it?"" I was like ""Buddy that's a large coffee, I'm not gonna chug it. I'll take the donuts, can you just reimburse me the coffee?"" He flat out refused, said that now that it was made there was nothing he could do, and that I already paid. Yes I paid, but I did not know the coffee would not be transportable. He said I was unreasonable and ungrateful. As I needed to go to work, I took off with the donuts, leaving the coffee on the counter, without getting paid back.

I'm annoyed now, but also, I'm like, was I really an asshole? I did not wanted to be fully reimbursed, just the coffee because I could neither drink it nor take it with me. Was it unreasonnable? ",33,1755420507.0,AmItheAsshole,43,0.77,False
1msltvu,https://i.redd.it/p7pbin5cmjjf1.jpeg,Tell me about your unfurnished F1B reverse Bernedoodles. We just brought home our new puppy and I’m over the moon.,"For context Zelda Rose Spellman aka Zellie, or little bear cub is my dream dog. The dog I never believed I’d ever have. In October 2013 I groomed my first adorably needy Berner at Petsmart. I fell immediately for this goofy boy. He was enormous and so sweet. A wonderful companion but to big for me in my current house. I dreamed of having one someday. 

By 2014 I was grooming a very small Bernese Mountain Dog. She was a pure and ethically breed dog just accidentally small. And absolutely perfect. I got to know the bred more and ached to know of their beautiful but bittersweet short life. 

In 2015 when I was at college I learned they could be wonderful service dogs too.  He was at a coffee shop on campus. So fluffy, big soft beautiful eyes, absolutely cuddly.  He was sleeping by his mom’s feet peaceful and quiet. And again I sighed knowing even if I could hope to have one they’d life would be too short. 

At this point, in my current relationship my ex boyfriend was very anti big dog. Also a Bern is a big shedder and he had asthma like me. Even though I tolerated it better. He only liked Cotons as a breed and his family had two. When we split ways I ended up with someone else who didn’t want a large breed dog. And than this relationship ended too and I dreamed again. I had a short but passionate friendship with a girl in Switzerland and this just made me want a Bern more. Yet 
I wasn’t financially able but physically and emotionally after being diagnosed with CRPs. I knew when my current baby passed I’d make the jump. But again life didn’t go as planned my next girlfriend also wasn’t keen on a big dog. She was afraid of big dogs and also allergic. 

And as our relationship got more serious I gave up having a Bern forever. And I rationalised that because of their short life. And that’s when I found the Bernedoodle, by accident. 

4 years of grieving my soul dog had me crying and unsure I could get another dog. But my now fiancée knew I wanted a dog so when we had the ability we got a dog she felt most comfortable with a Samoyed we named Harley. I love this dog she became my child. We’ve had her five months, we brought her hope at 10 weeks. I’d tried to convince her on a Bernedoodles but she was fearful and felt it would be too big. Yes I know they come smaller but she knew I’d want the biggest. Harley is a great dog but she was really lonely and we knew she needed a sibling and I started to again try and open her to a Bernedoodle. And I got her to go look at a puppy a Reverse F1b Bernedoodle. And she loved how she looked and she her soft fur. And so she agreed and we brought home my dream dog. 

A puppy who looks like a Bern but with the potential for a longer life. 

If you’ve gotten this far I’d love to hear about your experiences. Are your puppies more in line with the temperament of a Berner? Tell me about your wonderful dog. Everything from the good the difficult to the rewarding. ",3,1755420498.0,Bernedoodles,0,1.0,False

 1. The used ground coffee doesn’t fall out as nice button as it does in youtube videos. Am I tamping the coffee too hard? Other issue might be that my grinder leaves the coffee quite coarse.

3. What accessories you recommend? The original plastic tamper is not nice, that I will change soon. (Recommendations?) I also don’t have this mixer thing (the thing with spikes, dont know the name). Is that worth to buy? ",1,1755420221.0,DailyQuestion,0,1.0,False

1mslqh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1mslqh9/confused_about_open_communication_vs_burdening/,Confused about open communication vs burdening,"Hello beautiful people <3

I need some advice regarding when, how, and if I should open up about some feelings of jealousy and insecurity.
I am currently in a poly relationship with 2 people that also date each other, and we live together (in a house big enough that can accommodate privacy etc but so far we've been sleeping all together most nights).
We moved in together fairly recently, about 3 months total, and of course feelings of jealousy come up, and a lot of insecurity, but I would say we are quite good at communicating openly and working around each others traumas in a way that everyone feels supported and heard.

What I wanted to ask is, the difference between communicating something honest, and burdening the other person with your own feelings of jealousy.

Most days our schedules make it so we don't have a lot of time to cuddle in bed in the mornings. But every now and then we do, and most times I feel extremely sad and left out. My brain keeps spiraling that the kind of affection that my partners share in the morning is never given to me in the same way, and that it must mean I am less important.
I'm aware about my insecurities and how they stem from old trauma, about getting sidelined and being unwanted.

Sometimes I will just get up and make us all coffee and cry a bit in privacy and then I'll distract myself and it gets better. I try hard not to be passive aggressive or act like they did something wrong because they didn't, although sometimes I fear that getting out of bed without saying anything might appear that way.

This morning it happened again, and just as I was starting to distract myself but still crying my girlfriend joined me for the coffee I made. We talked about something else for a bit (I lost my phone yesterday 😂 and she was asking if I want to cancel our swimming plans to go look for it) and after a while she asked me if I am ok. I told her I am ok, that I got a bit sad in the morning and that now I'm getting better by scrolling a bit on Reddit. She acknowledged that but didn't question further, which I appreciate in a way because I get very emotional when I need to talk about feelings, especially without preparation, and I didn't want to start the day like that.

What I am trying to say in a very lengthy manner is: What would be the better thing to do? Let her know about my triggers on this specific situation? Leave it as it is and deal with my own insecurities about why I don't receive the same kind of affection in the morning? Try to spark more smaller conversations about how I could be more validated by her? (The latter happens already).

I am looking for a more experienced outlook, even though I know there are not many experienced poly people in such constellations, but I'm pretty sure that the same advice could apply here, as jealousy and openness are things every poly person navigates.

✔️ People are weird.

So far I have ruled out over consumption of caffeine or alcohol (I do not drink and my caffeine intake each day is zero or 1 cup of coffee and I do not drink regularly). But it could have something to do with my anxiety considering I have a very stressful job and I often stress about being able to fall asleep as the early hours in order to get my full amount of required sleeping, also I have been diagnosed with moderate anxiety since the age of 6 and am currently not taking anything.

So I 26f started dating this guy for 7 months 32m I’ll call bob. Bob has a ex girlfriend 30f that he broke up with because she was cheating on him. Bob was a great guy so i thought. He woke up and go get me coffee or breakfast. He given me messages and ran me baths. He was a very sweet and kind man (this will come up later). I have my own place but I was at his place every night but last weekend he asked me if i could stay at my place so he could paint him living room. I said that was fine (thinking because he cared) I told him he could stay at my place but he said my place was too far from his work and he had to work (he works one weekend a month). Well that weekend I left my sleeping pills at his house and called him to come get them. Bob didn’t pick up after I called 5 times so I drove over to his house. When I got there I saw his ex car. I know what she looks like and drive because she still friends with his sister in law. Well I went up to the house and open the door because I have a key to his house and they was getting it on on the kitchen table. Had you bent over and everything. He stop and stared at me and I stared at him. Bob said let me explain baby. I laughed to hard I almost cried laughing as turned to leave Bob ran after me in his underwear and I laughed more. I got in my car and left. He called and texted me but I didn’t answer and waited Monday while he was at work to get my stuff and left his keys. I’m pretty sure that AH (his ex) stole my sleeping pills because I had 30 and when I grabbed my pill bottle there was only two left. So anyway two days ago I was at a bar and Bob shows up. I don’t know how he knew I was there and I had a few drinks by now and he was begging for me to forgive him and that she came on to him and he was weak because (me and him have never slept together) and he straight up told me he didn’t want to push me to have sex with him so I slept with his ex until I was ready and swear he was going stop once we did. I stared at him like he was dumb the whole time while he cried and begged. Bob said he would stop and block his ex and never talk and wait as long as I need to and do whatever he needed to fix it. I said no. He started begging and grabbed me while I tried to leave. I snapped and yelled “I don’t fucking want you and I don’t have to fucking be with you now leave me alone”. Bob let go of me and left crying while everyone looked at me. My friend said I went to far because Bob is a really great man and he just made a mistake and most guys would dump me if i didn’t give it up. My other friend said I was right to not want to be with him but I didn’t have to yell at him like that. I said i only yelled because he wouldn’t let go of me and I freaked out because I have problems from my past. My friends still think I was in the wrong and could held it better.

1msljbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/VelvetUnderground/comments/1msljbd/anyone_else_loves_the_velvet_underground_for_the/,anyone else loves the velvet underground for the minimalism?,"i am a big fan of minimalism, not necessarily in visual design (especially since it is kinda overused nowadays and associated with soulless corporate image), but generally in everything. not just less is more, but kinda wanna do things as perfectly as possible with minimal variability in materials and assets. long story short i think i know when someone does great in minimalism when i see it (or hear it).

anyway, lou reed is notorious for his minimalistic approach and the 3rd LP i.e. self titled album is such a perfect case of it.

its so stripped down, the beauty is not in super catchy chorus, very technical vocals and instrumental or sophisticated lyrics, but in small things like very subtle rhythm change.

it sounds kinda boring if you dont have an ear yet for it or not familiar with other VU albums, but its just so beautiful. seeing beauty in it is kinda like tasting and enjoying the depth of very subtle flavour variations in good black coffee.

the super simple drums, even lou’s voice often sounds like he has just enough air to only say the words he says and not for even a tiny bit more, e.g. this part in pale blue eyes:

“It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend”

i initially disliked the album cuz i really liked what john cale was doing and it kinda felt like they degraded sonically and lyrically, but holy shit i was wrong and it became my second favourite only after white light/white heat.

you cant surprise anyone with minimalism and being really intentional with all components of a song nowadays, but damn they were doing it in 1969 right after inventing noise rock

anyway sorry for ranting i am just snorting amphetamine at work and have nothing else to do but write love letters to my fav band",3,1755419354.0,VelvetUnderground,4,1.0,False

1mslfi7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mslfi7,Made my own tea resin!,"I recently watched a video from Jesse’s Teahouse where he made tea resin - cha gao. I had a tin of kinda mediocre white tea, so I decided to give it a go. I do not recommend it unless you have a tonne of tea that you need to use up, or you’re super curious, because it’s a massive pain in the neck. But here’s how I did it, if you’re curious. 
First, big pot of water, a bit over a gallon. Because it’s a bai cha, I wanted to make sure that I didn’t boil it, just bring it to a high steam. No idea if I got it to the right temperature - next time I’ll use a bloody thermometer! When I thought it looked right, In goes the entire tin. Wasn’t actually planning to use the whole thing, probably didn’t need to, but I decided to commit. 
I let this thing stew for an hour, topping up the water after half an hour. You’ve (hopefully) never seen a cup of white tea this dark. 
I took out all the tea leaves, and realised I’d forgotten to rinse the leaves first! The tea was pretty cloudy, so I strained it all through a coffee filter. I don’t recommend this, the filters would get clogged after every ladleful. Once I’d strained it all, back in the pot it goes. 
Then it’s put over a super low heat, barely any steam coming off, and then you just wait for hours and hours. I didn’t time it, but it was over eight hours. Every hour or so I’d get up and stir any residue around the side back into the mix. Had to do this more frequently towards the end. 
Finally, it gets to a consistency like melted chocolate, and at this point I had to stir it non-stop for about half an hour. Eventually, it got to the point where it wouldn’t fall off the spoon and could stand on its own. Here’s where I started to make every mistake possible. 
First, I put the mixture onto some alfoil, but when I tried to take off bits to roll into balls, a lot of the mixture stayed stuck. So I moved them onto cling wrap. Immediately had the same problem. In the end I just put the lot into a glass container and hoped for the best. I managed to save about 75% of the mixture. I put a paper towel over the top so it could continue to dry, and the next day got out my silpat. This is the only thing the tea doesn’t stick to! 
Rolling these balls was soooo boring. I’d have to stop and wash and dry my hands after every 5-10 balls. But I managed to get about 50. 
One of these made two cups that are way too strong! I could easily get 4 cups, probably more like 6. The taste is surprisingly good, especially as I thought it was a pretty inferior tea leaf. I’m going to let them dry a bit more, see if the flavor improves, and then hopefully they won’t melt into each other when I store them. 
Would I do it again? Only with an extremely good leaf, because I’m curious about how good it could be. It’s a lot of work to do for just a decent cuppa! 
Hope you found this interesting!",16,1755418934.0,tea,3,1.0,False

1mslco9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1mslco9/linguistics_programming_glossary_0825/,Linguistics Programming Glossary - 08/25,"# [Linguistics Programming Glossary](https://jtnovelo2131.substack.com/p/the-6-core-principles-of-linguistics)

# New Programmers:

* [Linguistics Programming (LP):](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lrqdzu/start_defining_linguistics_programming_and_how/) The skill of using human language as a precise programming language to [direct and control the behavior of an AI.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lpo9b3/linguistics_programming/)
   * *Example:* Instead of asking, ""Can you write about dogs?"" an LP programmer commands, ""Write a 500-word article about the history of dog domestication for a 5th-grade audience.""
* [Linguistics Programmer (LP Context):](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1m9vej6/stop_prompt_engineering_start_thinking_like_a/) An AI user who has shifted their mindset from having a conversation to giving clear, structured, and efficient commands to an AI.
* **Linguistics Code (LP Context):** The words, sentences, and structured text a programmer writes to command an AI.
   * *Example:* Generate three marketing slogans for a new coffee brand.
* [Driver vs. Engine Builder Analogy: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lqta5y/we_are_thinking_about_ai_wrong_heres_whats_hiding/)A core concept explaining the difference between LP and technical AI development.
   * **Engine Builders** (NLP/CL/AI engineers) build the AI itself.
   * **Drivers** (Linguistics Programmers) are the users who operate the AI with skill.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The technical field of computer science focused on building AI models that can understand and process human language. NLP specialists are the ""Engine Builders.""
* **AI Literacy Gap:** The difference between the capabilities of modern AI and the general public's understanding of how to use those capabilities effectively.

# AI Economics:

* **Context Window:** The AI's short-term or working memory (like a computer's RAM). It holds the information from your current conversation, but it has a limited size.
* **Token:** The basic unit of text that an AI processes. A token can be a whole word or a piece of a word. Everything you type, including spaces and punctuation, is broken down into tokens.
   * *Example:* The word ""running"" might be broken into two tokens: run and ning.
* **Token Bloat:** The use of unnecessary, conversational, or filler words in a prompt that consume tokens without adding to the core instruction.
   * *Example:* The phrase ""I was wondering if you could please do me a favor and..."" is pure token bloat.
* [Linguistic Compression (AI Glossing):](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lv6ray/humanai_linguistic_compression_programming_ai/) The first principle of LP. It is the practice of removing all token bloat to convey the most precise meaning in the fewest possible tokens.
   * *Example:* Compressing ""Could you please generate for me a list of five ideas..."" to ""Generate five ideas...""
* **Informational Density:** A measure of how much meaning is packed into each word or token. High informational density is the goal of Linguistic Compression.
* [ASL Glossing](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lrlowy/ai_linguistics_compression_maximizing_information/)**:** A written transcription method for American Sign Language that captures the essence of a concept by omitting filler words. It serves as the real-world model for Linguistic Compression (AI Glossing.)
   * *Example:* ""Are you going to the store?"" becomes STORE YOU GO-TO?

# Semantic Information Forest

* [Strategic Word Choice:](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lrmz7p/why_strategic_word_choices_matter/) The second principle of LP. It is the art of selecting the exact words that will guide the AI to a specific creative or analytical outcome, understanding that synonyms are different commands.
   * *Example:* Choosing the word void instead of blank to steer the AI toward a more philosophical and creative response.
* [Semantic Forest Analogy:](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1ltd2by/strategic_word_choice_and_the_flying_squirrel/) An analogy for the AI's entire knowledge base and next word selection.
   * **Trees** are core concepts.
   * **Branches** are specific words.
   * **Leaves** are the probable next words.
* **AI Hallucination:** An event where an AI generates information that is nonsensical, factually incorrect, or completely unrelated to the prompt, often because the prompt was ambiguous or led it down a low-probability path.

# Giving AI a Map

* [Contextual Clarity:](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1m3jzhu/contextual_clarity_glossary_of_key_terms/) The third principle of LP. It is the practice of providing the AI with sufficient background information (the who, what, where, why, and how) to eliminate ambiguity.
   * *Example:* Instead of ""Describe the mole,"" you provide context: ""Describe the subterranean mammal, the mole.""
* **Ambiguity:** The state of a prompt being unclear or having multiple possible meanings. It is the number one cause of AI failure.

# Input/Output Structure Design:

* **Structured Design:** The fourth principle of LP. It is the practice of organizing a prompt with the logic and formatting of a computer program, using headings, lists, and a clear sequence of commands.
* **Persona Pattern:** A framework for starting a prompt by clearly defining the AI's **Persona** (role), the **Audience** it's addressing, the **Goal** of the task, and any **Constraints** (rules).
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** A technique where you instruct the AI to ""think step-by-step"" by breaking down a complex request into a logical sequence of smaller tasks.
   * *Example:* Instructing an AI to first list pros, then list cons, and only then form a conclusion.
* [High-Performance Prompt:](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lwfqly/how_to_control_your_ai_with_words_lp_nocode/) A prompt that combines the Persona Pattern, clear context, and a step-by-step task list into a complete, logical structure.

# Know Your Machine

* **System Awareness:** The fifth principle of LP. It is the skill of adapting your prompting techniques to the unique characteristics of the specific AI model you are using.
* **AI Cohort:** A term used to classify different AI models (like Gemini, GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, Grok, etc) based on their unique training data, architecture, and fine-tuning, which gives each one a different ""personality"" and set of strengths.

# The Driver's Responsibility

* [Ethical Responsibility:](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1m84va3/ai_ethics_the_equivalent_of_being_a_good_driver/) The sixth and most important principle of LP. It is the foundational commitment to use AI for clarity, fairness, and empowerment, never for deception or harm.
* **Ethical Persuasion vs. Unethical Manipulation:**
   * **Persuasion** uses truth and clarity to empower someone to make a beneficial choice.
   * **Manipulation** uses deception or exploits weaknesses to trick someone.
* **Inherent AI Bias:** The stereotypes and unfair assumptions that an AI learns from its training data (which was written by humans). Ethical programmers work to identify and mitigate this bias.

# File First Memory:

* [System Prompt Notebook (SPN): ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1mdp5qp/i_barely_write_prompts_anymore_heres_the_system_i/)A structured document created by a user that serves as a persistent, external ""brain"" or ""operating system"" for an AI, transforming it into a specialized expert.
* **Context Engineering:** The practice of designing the entire information environment an AI operates within, primarily through the use of a System Prompt Notebook.
* [No-Code Solution: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1mix3nn/how_to_build_a_reusable_memory_for_your_ai_the/)A [technical solution ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinguisticsPrograming/comments/1lxrjk6/the_no_code_context_engineering_notebook_work/)that does not require the user to write any traditional computer code. The Digital Notebook is a no-code tool.",3,1755418643.0,LinguisticsPrograming,0,1.0,False
