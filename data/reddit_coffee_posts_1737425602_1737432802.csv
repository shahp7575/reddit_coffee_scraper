1i6a75z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1i6a75z/im_pregnant_again_and_this_time_im_scared/,"I'm pregnant again, and this time, I'm scared..","I'm 11m pp, and I just found out a few days ago that I'm pregnant. Based on when we last had sex, I'm about 4 weeks pregnant. First baby was planned, this one was an oopsie. (Also, I'm still breastfeeding).

I'm scared because I'm not ready to go through this entire year all over again. To make things worse, my husband is NOT happy at all. 

We just came back from a trip to Leavenworth with my inlaws, and the whole time we were up there, they were joking about me being pregnant because I was eating SO much. I took the trip as an opportunity to eat the foods I wanted because when we're at home, I pretty much have a cup of coffee and whatever there is to eat for dinner. Sometimes it's fast food, other times, it's whatever I make.

Well, because I had HG my first pregnancy, and I wasn't throwing up, I was SO confident that I wasn't pregnant.  So, to prove it, I took a pregnancy test, and lo and behold, I'm pregnant. 

My husband was in such a good mood when he joked about it, but since we found out that I am in fact pregnant, he's been telling me to get rid of it (although we are both pro-life), that he says that he hopes I miscarry, and that the ""bastard child I'm carrying is going to have a miserable life, because I don't love it."" He's been on me every single day trying to tear me down about it, and I'm already so exhausted. 

On top of all of this, my daughter and I are currently sick, (she has croup), and I'm the sole caretaker of her, the sole cleaner, cook, and whatever else responsibility falls only on me. He just gets to go to work and come home and play video games. To make things worse, He's been telling our daughter that she wasn't enough for me, so I had to go and forget my birth control to have another baby. 

I keep going back and forth on whether or not I should divorce him. As a Christian, I know I should trust in God, and let Him do the work in my husband that needs to be done. But, at the same time, would God really want my children to suffer? Would He want me to suffer? I know He's currently helping me work through wanting His approval instead of my husband's, and I'm praying that He reveals what that looks like to me.

My husband who was raised with Christian parents thinks that he shouldn't have to suffer or go through any hardship, and when I told him that I was choosing to trust God in this, he told me that he doesn't want God in his life if God is going to make him suffer by having another kid.

Ugh, idk what to do or why I'm even posting this to be honest. I just needed a place to vent for the most part. But if you got this far, thank you for listening.",1,1737432640.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve only ever gone on dates w men, though I‚Äôve never actually been in a relationship. I‚Äôm in my early 20s. Over the past two years I‚Äôve come to realize I‚Äôm gay. It was a really difficult revelation for me to deal with‚Ä¶ lots of internalized homophobia to unpack that I didn‚Äôt even know was there. I finally worked up the courage to hop on the apps recently and there was this one beautiful girl that caught my eye immediately. We‚Äôve been messaging back and forth a bit and I asked her for a coffee date sometime soon. She said yes. I was feeling fine before, but now I‚Äôm feeling nervous. 

When I get nervous, I tend to go into an anxiety shut down and it shows as a very surface level, performative mode. Like I‚Äôm in survival and can only think one word ahead of the next. I just want to be relaxed and make a good impression. 

Furthermore, what are you expectations of a first date. Please help ease my anxiety and tell me about how your goodbyes and hellos usually look. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve always been most flustered with in the past (with men, probably because I didn‚Äôt want them to touch me). 

I guess what I‚Äôm looking for is some first date pointers from your own experience and some wise words of advice to calm me down a bit. She‚Äôs just so beautiful I don‚Äôt want to fumble the bag. ",1,1737432525.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

She kind of just made an offhanded comment? She was drinking coffee as well, she didn‚Äôt really seem sick? I know she‚Äôs someone that‚Äôs had surgery and often complains about being overly full and/or bloated so I‚Äôm wondering if she was just having some indigestion. She didn‚Äôt go to the bathroom or anything. I‚Äôm just worried if it was something contagious, I will catch it as we were right next to each other and I had to work at her desk/her computer. I washed my hands well, didn‚Äôt touch my face, wiped down my desk with a medical grade wipe, and changed when I got home, but if she is s* I feel like I‚Äôm doomed.

I‚Äôm also meant to go out with a friend on Thursday who has a young child. Not sure if her kid will be with her, but the sb* is going around pretty heavily in the surrounding cities and I‚Äôm pretty sure her kid is in daycare, so I‚Äôm terrified that I would catch something from either of them. I haven‚Äôt seen this friend in a while and I want to catch up, but I am also so tempted to reschedule for sometime later when it‚Äôs not going around as bad. My friend is also emetophobic so I feel like she would be upfront and tell me, but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll get there and THEN she‚Äôll tell me and I won‚Äôt have an escape. I‚Äôm also spending time with my mom this weekend and she works at a school where she specifically said people are coming down with it. ü•≤ She also knows about my phobia but I don‚Äôt think she realizes how severe it is because she‚Äôll bring up that stuff on her own without realizing how triggering it is. Obviously I want to spend time with my mom but I‚Äôm worried that even if she‚Äôs not s* she‚Äôll still be contagious in some way. It all just feels so inescapable this week.

I know it‚Äôs not healthy but I just want to hide inside lol. Trying to be brave but I want to just cancel everything and stay home because I am not that brave and my mental health has kind of been a wreck recently.

i‚Äôve been working this new job for almost two months now, and it‚Äôs in a restaurant environment. i, f17, have worked in other fast food places before and as much as i dislike it, there aren‚Äôt many other options. ever since i started working there, i feel like i can‚Äôt connect with anyone no matter how hard i try, and it‚Äôs starting to bother me.

i understand that not everyone is going to like me, but it just seems unlikely that almost every single person i work with acts like i‚Äôm some kind of nuisance because i‚Äôm new. for the past few shifts i‚Äôve worked, i‚Äôve come home crying, not understanding what i‚Äôm doing wrong.

tonight, i was closing and another one of my coworkers told me to start closing down my station at 8:25 (we close at 9), and so i did. while i was closing, my manager came up to me and asked why i was shutting my station down. before i even got a chance to explain, he told me that was ‚Äúthe fastest way to lose my job‚Äù, and made me redo everything.

for context, i was putting coffee machines away and draining them. it was slow and nobody even came into the restaurant past 8:00.

admittedly i‚Äôm very sensitive and so i cried. i feel like a complete screw up 24/7 at this job and i can‚Äôt even talk to any of my coworkers without them looking at me like i‚Äôm an alien. i want to find a new job but i also feel like i should stay because the pay is nice and so are the hours. i just don‚Äôt know what to do, and if i‚Äôm overreacting and being too sensitive.

this isn‚Äôt the only instance i‚Äôve had of people i work with being shady or weird with me. a few days ago i needed help carrying a coffee machine which is literally half my size (i‚Äôm 4‚Äô10) and i ended up dropping it, and ended up having to clean up nearly an entire thing of coffee. instead of helping me everyone just laughed at me and i felt like an idiot. it feels like no matter what i do, it‚Äôs wrong. if i ask for help i‚Äôm nuisance, but if i don‚Äôt ask for help, i‚Äôm still being a nuisance some how.

I tried sertaline, which was awful and am now pretty stable on lexapro (escitalopram). It has worked well for pulling me out of the anxiety hurricane I was in, but it's also blunted all the good feelings I used to have. My whole life I've been a very sensory person, loving smells, certain textures, good food. When I was in nature I could feel the earth and even the animals sometimes. 
But now it's like everything is grey or just 'vanilla'. Sunsets are just nice colors. Having a coffee is not a taste sensation anymore, it's just a drink. 
Walking in nature is like looking at a nice painting, but I don't feel connected to it. It's so strange and weird, although I guess this is many non HSPs experience the world. 
I want my experiential self back, but not the anxiety that came with it.

1i69zcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1i69zcn/severe_gerd_and_pregnancy_nexium/,Severe GERD and Pregnancy - Nexium,"36 weeks pregnant. My GERD has progressed to ulcer formation and aspiration of large amount of acid while sleeping leading to intense choking fits. I am scared to sleep at this point. My OB has been in for a GI consult (I used to see GI as I had strictures several years ago but my acid reflux felt controlled enough on occasional Pepcid).

I am now on Nexium 20mg in the AM and Pepcid 20 mg at night after failing Protonix. I was initially prescribed 40mg of Nexium but I have chose to use the smaller dosage cause I‚Äôm afraid of its impact on my baby/myself - especially with vitamin absorption. 

At this point all I eat (drink) are fruit/vegetable smoothies with flax/chia seeds and yogurt. Some light proteins like chicken/pastas without red sauces/protein shakes. I‚Äôve had issues my whole life so I know my triggers pretty well (mainly chocolate, tomatoes, citrus, coffee). 

Hoping this goes back to its normal ‚Äúmild‚Äù reflux after birth. I know I‚Äôve always had a ‚Äúweak esophageal sphincter‚Äù so I think the baby has made it basically useless. Oddly the Nexium seems to help a lot with the painful acid (thankfully) but I‚Äôm still waking up choking on reflux/just moving in bed can cause it to come out forcefully. My aunt passed from esophageal cancer due to unrelenting GERD so that‚Äôs always at the back of my mind to keep my symptoms under control/get screenings.

Does anyone have any other tips? I cant do Tums unfortunately due to kidney stone history. I am at my wits end with it and losing weight. I personally don‚Äôt think anything will help besides delivering this baby but I‚Äôm open to any ideas.",1,1737431949.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

The night began like any other: still, quiet, and heavy with the kind of calm that feels unnatural. Jason sat alone on his porch, sipping lukewarm coffee, staring into the abyss of the star-dappled sky. But something was off. The stars seemed‚Ä¶ wrong. Their usual brilliance was dimmed, replaced by a faint, pulsating light that flickered in an unfamiliar rhythm.

And then, he heard it.

A low hum, so subtle it could have been imagined, vibrated through the air. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound‚Äîit was a feeling. A deep, resonant frequency that settled in Jason‚Äôs bones, tugging at his insides like an invisible magnet.

He stood, scanning the darkness, when the lights appeared.

Three pinpricks of white hovered in the sky, growing larger and more menacing as they descended. They didn‚Äôt flicker like stars; they breathed, expanding and contracting like living organisms. Jason‚Äôs pulse quickened, a primal instinct screaming at him to run, but his body refused to obey.

The largest orb broke away from the group, casting a blinding beam of light onto the earth below. Jason barely had time to shield his eyes before he felt his body lift from the ground. The world spun, his senses overwhelmed by the light, the hum, the sudden weightlessness.

And then came the darkness.

When Jason opened his eyes, he was no longer on his porch. He was in a place that defied comprehension. The walls of the chamber stretched infinitely, yet closed in around him like a coffin. They pulsed faintly, as though alive, their surface covered in a shifting, organic texture that seemed to ripple beneath his gaze.

He was strapped to a table, naked and vulnerable, his limbs restrained by something cold and wet. A sharp chemical smell hung in the air, mingling with the faint scent of decay. Jason‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest as he struggled, but the restraints tightened, biting into his skin.

Then, they came.

The creatures weren‚Äôt humanoid‚Äîno, they were something far worse. Their bodies were thin and impossibly elongated, their movements eerily fluid, as if they were made of liquid wrapped in a fragile skin. Their faces were featureless save for their eyes, enormous black voids that swallowed light. Jason couldn‚Äôt tell if they had mouths, but he could feel them watching, judging, feeding.

One of them stepped closer, its bony fingers stretching toward him. They didn‚Äôt have nails, just tapered tips that split into thin tendrils as they reached his chest. Jason screamed as they pressed into his flesh‚Äînot cutting, but entering, writhing beneath his skin. He felt them snake through his veins, slithering towards his heart.

His vision blurred, the pain so intense he could barely think. And then, like a switch had been flipped, he was flooded with their thoughts.

Images flashed through his mind‚Äîentire planets consumed by shadow, civilisations obliterated in moments, their screams echoing through endless darkness. He saw Earth, fractured and lifeless, its skies choked with smoke and its oceans turned black.

And he understood.

They were already here.

Jason woke up on his porch, the coffee still steaming beside him. The night was quiet again, the stars steady and unmoving. For a brief, blissful moment, he convinced himself it was a nightmare. But his chest ached, the skin around his heart bruised and tender.

He wasn‚Äôt alone.

The hum was louder now, echoing inside his skull no matter where he went. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound; it was a warning. Or maybe‚Ä¶ an announcement.

The disappearances began the following week. Friends, neighbours, entire families vanished without a trace. The sky turned an eerie, greenish hue, and a strange static hung in the air, making it hard to breathe. Jason knew what was coming, but no one believed him.

Then, the orbs returned.

This time, they didn‚Äôt hide. The ships blotted out the sun, descending upon cities like enormous, silent predators. Their beams of light didn‚Äôt just abduct‚Äîthey consumed, reducing everything they touched to ash. The creatures poured out in hordes, moving through the streets like shadows made flesh. They didn‚Äôt kill for sport; they harvested.

Jason hid in his basement, clutching a shotgun he knew was useless. The hum was deafening now, vibrating through the walls, the floor, his very bones. He could feel them getting closer, their presence pressing against his mind like a suffocating weight.

And then he heard their voices.

‚ÄúYou are the bridge. You brought us here.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs chest burned as their tendrils stirred inside him, their essence rooted deep within his heart. He realised, with growing horror, that he hadn‚Äôt just been abducted‚Äîhe had been infected. The hum wasn‚Äôt their signal to attack; it was his.

The door to the basement creaked open, though he hadn‚Äôt heard footsteps. The last thing Jason saw was the glistening black void of their eyes, impossibly wide, reflecting a world swallowed by darkness.

And then, silence.

I was eight years old when my dad left. I remember the day vividly. It was a Saturday morning, and I had just woken up, excited to spend the weekend with him. He had promised to take me to the park to fly the new kite he‚Äôd bought me. But instead of finding him in the kitchen making pancakes like he always did, I found my mom sitting at the table, crying silently.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Dad?‚Äù I asked, clutching my kite tightly.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù she whispered, barely able to meet my eyes.

At first, I didn‚Äôt understand. I thought he‚Äôd gone to the store or maybe left for work early. But as the hours turned into days, and the days into weeks, it became clear that he wasn‚Äôt coming back.

The next few years were hard. My mom worked two jobs to keep us afloat, and I did my best to help out, even though I was just a kid. Every time I saw a man with dark hair and a kind smile, I‚Äôd wonder if it was him. I‚Äôd imagine him walking back through the door, apologizing for leaving, telling us it had all been a mistake.

But he never came. No letters, no phone calls, nothing. It was like he had vanished into thin air.

As I grew older, I stopped hoping. I told myself that if he didn‚Äôt want to be part of my life, then I didn‚Äôt need him. I buried my feelings deep down and focused on school, friends, and eventually building a life of my own.

Then, out of the blue, everything changed.

It was a rainy afternoon when I got the call. I was 28 years old, working as a graphic designer, and living in a small apartment downtown. When my phone rang, I didn‚Äôt recognize the number.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered cautiously.

There was a long pause on the other end before a voice I hadn‚Äôt heard in two decades said, ‚ÄúIs this Anna?‚Äù

I froze. The voice was older, rougher, but unmistakable. ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù I whispered, my heart pounding.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know I have no right to ask this, but... can we talk?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. Part of me wanted to hang up, to scream at him for abandoning us. But another part of me, the little girl who had spent years waiting for him to come back, wanted to hear him out.

We agreed to meet at a caf√© near my apartment. I spent the next few days agonizing over what to say. Should I demand an explanation? Should I forgive him?

When the day finally came, I almost didn‚Äôt go. But curiosity‚Äîand maybe a sliver of hope‚Äîgot the better of me.

He was already there when I arrived, sitting at a corner table with a cup of coffee in front of him. He looked older than I‚Äôd imagined‚Äîhis hair was gray, and there were deep lines etched into his face. But his eyes, those same kind eyes I remembered, hadn‚Äôt changed.

‚ÄúAnna,‚Äù he said, standing up as I approached.

I sat down without saying a word, my hands clenched into fists under the table.

‚ÄúI owe you an explanation,‚Äù he began, his voice trembling. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve hurt you, and there‚Äôs nothing I can say to make up for the years I missed. But I need you to know the truth.‚Äù

He told me he had left because he was struggling with severe depression and felt like he was failing as a husband and father. He didn‚Äôt know how to ask for help, so he ran. He said he had spent years regretting his decision but didn‚Äôt feel he deserved to come back until he had worked on himself.

‚ÄúI was a coward,‚Äù he admitted, tears streaming down his face. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve spent every day wishing I could undo the pain I caused you and your mother.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. Part of me wanted to believe him, to forgive him and start fresh. But another part of me couldn‚Äôt forget the years of heartache, the birthdays and milestones he had missed, the nights I had cried myself to sleep wondering why I wasn‚Äôt enough for him to stay.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can forgive you,‚Äù I said finally, my voice shaking. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt there when I needed you most.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúI just hope that someday, you‚Äôll let me try to make it up to you. Even if it‚Äôs just a little.‚Äù

The conversation ended awkwardly, and we went our separate ways. I spent the next few weeks reflecting on everything he had said. Slowly, I began to realize that holding onto my anger wasn‚Äôt helping me. It was only keeping me stuck in the past.

I decided to give him a chance‚Äînot because he deserved it, but because I needed closure. We started meeting for coffee once a month, and over time, I began to see him not as the man who abandoned me, but as someone who had made terrible mistakes and was trying to make amends.

It hasn‚Äôt been easy, and our relationship is far from perfect. But we‚Äôre rebuilding, one conversation at a time.

Sometimes, forgiveness isn‚Äôt about letting someone off the hook. It‚Äôs about freeing yourself from the weight of the pain they caused. My dad may never be the father I needed growing up, but he‚Äôs here now, and for me, that‚Äôs a start.",1,1737430928.0,u_Distinct_Cry7688,0,1.0,False

**In a world where pouring milk first is shunned, Mark speaks up for his people and faces the consequences.** 

(PART ONE)

""I hope you bring up cereal."" Mark finally said when he'd steeled his nerve. The air went still. Mark breathed deep in his best attempt to keep his voice even. This episode had revolved around the right order to make things, and finally, for once, Mark felt he'd worked up the courage to say what he'd always needed to discuss. It went with him everywhere. When he looked in the mirror, he saw it in his own eyes. On the streets he'd seen people like him dragged away by the Secret Cereal Squad to a place he didn't want to think about. One couldn't ask, couldn't even consider a different way of living. Children with wandering minds were dealt with quickly and molded into the right kind of citizen and since he was a child Mark knew to keep his mouth shut and his habits private.

Being a milk firster was a dangerous game in this world. Mark knew it as well as he knew his own name, but he still found himself incapable of stopping. Each time he reached for the cereal and tilted it over the bowl he froze. It was as if he was paralyzed. Moments would pass, and he would finally relent, reaching for the milk instead and doing as he preferred. Sometimes it disgusted him too. He'd start to cry as he poured but he couldn't stop until the cereal was made, until it was rightfully atop the milk and he could start to eat while wiping tears from his cheeks.¬†

Some days, boldly, he'd leave the shutters open. He wasn't sure why. Maybe it was the idea that somebody would see him and tell him it was okay, or that he truly believed his sin should be witnessed and lawfully punished. Was there some kind of justice for somebody like him? Mark wasn't sure.¬†

""Oh, that one's quick and easy, okay. "" Bob's tone was casual, but his expression, too, had gone somewhat stiff.¬†

""How can you screw this up?"" Wade stared at Mark, too. He felt their stares crawling up his spine. It was as if they were staring right through the screen, as if they were in the same room. ""Right, Mark?""¬†

""There's only one answer with cereal."" Bob said, his tone clear and confident.¬†

""Here we go."" Wade murmured.¬†

""Bowl of cereal, what order?""¬†¬†

Mark steeled himself and leaned forward. It was now or never. He would speak up for himself, his people, he would speak out against this corrupt society and stand up for something. Finally, for once in his career, he would show his true self. Mark took a deep breath. Was he truly standing up? Was he actually about to tell them? Would this be the end of his career, all the hard work he'd put in to get here? Was he going to be dragged off, rejected, mocked?¬†

He found that he didn't care. He could no longer live pretending he was like them when he wasn't. The viewers out there, the other secret Milk Firsters, they could see his brave act and accept themselves. Whatever happened, Mark was ready to face the music. He was done hiding. The words formed on his tongue. Mark forced his mouth to open.¬†

""You put the bowl down.""¬†

Tension stretched between them. A bead of sweat formed on Mark's temple.

""You pour milk in it. Then you pour your cereal.""¬†

""Mark...""

""I'll die on this hill, Bob. There's so many reasons.""¬†

And he embarked on an explanation as to why one should always pour their milk first. It stays drier, he argued, it keeps the cereal from getting soggy. It creates the perfect ratio of milk to cereal at the end, the perfect quantity that you desire. He told them how it went, why it was the right way, and in that moment Mark felt he was convincing an executioner not to sever his head. He couldn't look directly at the other two as he spoke, so instead he looked at his hands as he gestured along with the words. Mark's heart picked up speed until he reached the end of his argument and he felt like it would explode.¬†

Mark swallowed, raising his chin and staring at Bob and Wade on his screen. He was smiling as if it was a joke, but the playful expressions of the other two had long faded away. Their expressions held only dull shock. Bob's melted into something like resignation.

That's when Mark knew all of this had been a horrible mistake.¬†

""Wade."" Bob's tone turned dark.

""Yeah.""¬†

With a hum, the room started to shake. Mark gripped at his chair to keep from falling and glanced about for the source. Nothing jumped out. The coffee he'd set by his keyboard rumbled and tipped over, spilling over his desk to the floor, and Mark jumped back in shock. When he looked back at his screen Bob and Wade had risen to their feet. The lighting shifted behind them and then shut off completely, pitching them into darkness.¬†

""Guys?"" Mark called, looking around again in desperation. To his left and his right the walls had separated in two, a dark line sliced right down the center of each. And slowly, surely, they were moving apart, the crack widening inch by inch. Mark blinked, his jaw dropping. The room light flickered and shut off. His speakers shrieked a beep before the screen went bright white, a dark symbol in the center. In it a man stood with a cereal bowl held above his head. Mark recognized the logo immediately, the source of his issues throughout the years, the reason people like him had to hide at all. His heart skipped a beat, then lodged in his throat.¬†

The Secret Cereal Squad. They'd found him. No-- they must have been waiting. Was the house built this way when he moved in, or did they alter it over time? How long had they suspected him?¬†

Mark had made a huge mistake.¬†

Shutters clattered down over his windows, shutters he didn't install. Mark gaped. The walls to either side had completely pulled away now, and on the line that used to be the wall stood silhouettes. Familiar silhouettes. The ones he least wanted to see of anybody. Because if this was the SCS's doing, then the people standing must be part of it. But it was impossible. It couldn't be. Of anybody...

""Bob? Wade?"" Mark asked, voice trembling.¬†

The light shifted. Mark saw their faces, stony and grim. Bob and Wade were working with the Secret Cereal Squad.¬†

""Mark.""

He ran. Mark spun, stumbling on the coffee all over his floor, and slammed into the door. It had locked. Somehow, the door had locked, and no matter how much he turned and fought the doorknob it wouldn't turn. Like a monkey shaking the bars of its cage, he pulled and shoved it, fighting with everything he had. He screamed, banging his fists, anything to escape-- but it was no use.¬†

""I thought you could get better."" Wade said, and Mark finally turned to look at him. Wade slowly shook his shining bald head, frowning deep. ""That we'd been mistaken when they came to us. What happened to you, man? Were you always like this?""  


""Don't get sentimental, Wade. That's not Mark. There was no Mark. That's a Milk Firster standing right in front of you."" His eyes narrowed, and he held up a large gun. Had it always been there, just beyond the wall? Were they waiting for this? How long?¬†

""They came to you? When?""¬†

""Years ago, Mark. Before Distractible. Before all of this.""¬†

""All of this...?"" Mark still clutched at the doorknob as if it would magically open, his knuckles turning white. There was no way out. Only his bright monitor illuminated the room, casting the other two's faces into something shadowy and monstrous.¬†¬†

""All of this. Just after we met, a few months. We didn't know each other very well yet.""¬†

""Mark. Listen to me. There's no way out of this, but there's a way to survive. You've seen them dragged away. You must have heard rumors of where they were going. But listen to me."" Wade repeated the sentence when Mark's tear-filled eyes had drifted away toward the window. There were sounds coming from outside much like the tactical step of soldiers, and he thought he could hear the chop of a helicopter's propeller. ""You can make it out. Just listen to them. Pour the cereal first. If you put your head down and focus, you can show them that you've changed. You can come back. We can pretend none of this ever happened.""

""But it was all fake. You were always working with them."" His voice was lofty, like he was floating somewhere just out of reach of all this-- and it was how he felt as he saw his life crumbling before his eyes, as he felt real punishment right before his fingertips, as he tasted betrayal sour on his tongue.¬†

""Admit it, Mark. You were fake too. You let us believe you were like the rest of us, that you made your cereal the way it's supposed to be made. But you weren't, and you didn't. This isn't all on us. You'll thank the SCS when this is over.""

Mark's ears rang. The world spun.¬†

""It was real to me, Mark."" Wade said quietly, and Mark thought he saw him blink back tears. But he, too, pulled out a gun, and the sound of it loading did nothing to lessen Mark's shock. ""Come back to us when all this is done. You can be normal. You won't need to live in fear anymore.""¬†

""I can't believe you guys. I trusted you. I trusted you, I... we were supposed to be... you guys really..."" He leaned against the door, pressing a hand to his forehead. ""No."" He said so softly it was barely a breath.¬†

Wade shook his head, chin low. Bob still pointed his gun directly at Mark, unwavering.¬†

""You're going to need to put your hands on your head. The SCS is waiting for you outside, so don't try anything funny.""¬†

It might have been a trick of the eye, but Mark thought he saw Wade mouth 'I'm sorry' in the dark.",2,1737430849.0,distractible,0,1.0,False

Would anyone here in MT support one? As a former business owner I gotta admit I'm hating the corporate life. Now that I'm leaving it behind and potentially chasing being a business owner again I was wondering if anyone in Montana would appreciate a Liberal run gun shop (if one doesn't already exist)? Think about it; no Trump flags, no Confederate flags, no Jesus stuff, no Tesla Cyber Trucks.... Just guns and gun stuff all under a ""the 2A is for all of us"" roof with a lounge area for visitors to just sit, and vibe with one another over a cup of coffee or something when not buying anything. Granted for safety reasons I wouldn't deck the place out in Liberal signage (let's face it MT is very red) but it'd be a safe haven for those of us who feel nervous walking into a shop these days.

Looking at Butte primarily as I'm moving to the region. Figure maybe after I get my bearings together when I make the move I might try my hand at the industry. Missoula would be nice but it's an hour and a half from where I'm moving while Butte is only 30 minutes. 

Thoughts? Insight?

I had been assigned to this carrier only a few weeks ago, fresh from training, and still adjusting to the labyrinthine maze of corridors, stairwells, and bulkheads that made up our floating city.

It was late, long past the usual hum of activity. Most of the crew were asleep, save for a few night shift personnel. My bunk was cramped, and the incessant hum of the engines below made it impossible to sleep. I decided to head to the galley for some coffee, figuring the walk might help clear my mind.

The carrier at night was a different beast. Shadows stretched unnaturally under the dim red emergency lights that lined the halls. The sound of footsteps echoed in ways that felt off, as if the ship itself was mimicking me.

I took a wrong turn near the lower decks, where the storage and maintenance rooms were located. It wasn‚Äôt unusual to get lost‚Äîthere were dozens of identical passageways‚Äîbut something felt wrong this time. The air was heavier here, stale and metallic.

As I walked further, the sound of the engines became muffled, replaced by a strange clicking noise. It wasn‚Äôt mechanical; it sounded...organic. I froze, straining to hear over my own breath.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called out, my voice bouncing eerily off the steel walls.

No response. Just more clicking, closer now.

I turned and hurried back the way I‚Äôd come, but the corridor didn‚Äôt look familiar anymore. My heart began to race. Every door I passed was sealed shut, their small porthole windows blacked out.

The clicking grew louder, interspersed with faint whispers that I couldn‚Äôt make out. It sounded like multiple voices speaking at once, overlapping in an unintelligible drone.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called again, louder this time. The whispers stopped.

And then, I heard it‚Äîa sharp, metallic clang behind me. I spun around, but the corridor was empty. My pulse thundered in my ears.

I didn‚Äôt wait to see what was coming. I bolted down the hallway, not caring where it led, just needing to get away. The whispers started again, louder and more insistent, like a chorus of voices all around me.

I stumbled into a stairwell and slammed the door behind me. The voices stopped abruptly, leaving only the sound of my ragged breathing. I leaned against the cold steel wall, trying to calm down.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

At the bottom of the stairwell, partially obscured by shadows, something moved. It wasn‚Äôt a person. It was too large, too misshapen. A mass of limbs and something glinting in the dim light‚Äîteeth, maybe?

It started to climb. Slowly at first, then faster.

I didn‚Äôt wait to find out what it was. I sprinted up the stairs, taking them two at a time, my boots clanging against the metal. The creature‚Äôs movements grew louder, a sickening mix of wet squelches and metallic scraping.

I burst through the first door I found and slammed it shut behind me, locking it tight. I was back in a main corridor, the hum of the engines finally audible again.

I ran until I found another sailor, barely able to speak as I tried to explain what had happened. He looked at me like I was crazy, but he humored me, walking back with me to check it out.

When we got there, the stairwell was empty. No strange creature, no voices. Just the cold, empty steel of the ship.

He laughed it off, told me I‚Äôd been working too hard and needed sleep. But as he walked away, I noticed something on the floor‚Äîa single wet handprint smeared across the metal.

I never went back to the lower decks after that. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the whispers.

It dawned on me as I was drinking my morning coffee that the dog walker is coming tomorrow and I still need to give her the code to the yet to be installed smart lock sitting by my front door. Can't be that hard, I figured and began disassembling my front door lock with my handy screwdriver. And piece by piece by piece by massive piece this lock came apart. This is where I realized I might have a problem. This lock is massive, it is a big box that was sitting inside a hollow carved out of my door. It is, what I have since learned, a mortise lock. Around since the 18th century, the mortise lock is typically housed in this hefty metal box (stick plate)¬† that once unscrewed, reveals a series of levels, springs and mechanism that looks straight out of a steampunk movie. Fuck. This does not look the smart lock I brought. Fuck. Youtube¬†time: This Old House has an episode on old locks and the thumbnail looks like my lock - ah, it‚Äôs called a mortise lock. Reddit time: ugh, r/Locksmith  ridicules every OP posts about how to convert mortise lock to a smart lock. Not compatible. Well, I guess a smart lock is just not meant to be, I might just have to give the dog walker a set of my house keys. Besides, internet says this type of lock is super durable and strong.¬†

So I started putting the stick plate back into the pocket dug out of the door, wiggled it in and started twisting the keyhole thing back into place, jammed in doorknob and screwed everything back together. Darn, one the holes is starting to strip. Once I finished putting the lock back together, I tested out my install and stuck in my key. I wiggled the key around, it really sticky and hard to maneuver, I twisted it and the bolt wouldn‚Äôt engage, I twisted harder and worried about snapping the key. I tried pulling the key out and it‚Äôs STUCK. Back to YouTube, how to repair a mortise lock, could be a broke spring or something inside. I started disassembling the lock again, that hole is definitely stripped. Set it down on my dinning table and unscrewed the strickplate to look inside the lockbox. It‚Äôs pretty gnarly, black and rusty brown, I poked at black pieces that might have been grease stained twigs. Well, the video says I need to grease it up, I need WD-40, should I got to Lowes? Wait, I should look up how to repair stripped screwdriver holes in wood - wood glue and dowls then. And a quick Lowe‚Äôs trip later and I‚Äôm at my dinning table, spray WD-40 at the the lockbox until all the bits are shining with grease. I had picked out the twigs with fingers and my fingers are now stained black with grease seeping under my nails. Lock maintenance done, I felt proud of my work, I put the box back together again and took the thin wood dowl I brought earlier and smothered it in wood glue before poking it into the tiny stripped hole. I broken off the excess dowl and let the glue dry, while I started to reinstall the lock into the door. I screwed everything back together, my little patch worked great, and tried my key again. Damnit! Still jammed‚Ä¶.uuuuuuughhhhh. Fuck. Fuck. Sigh. Ok let‚Äôs go again. I went again three more times. Finally, I realized that the tumbler piece where the key goes in have to screwed in at a specific depth within door, not jammed flush to the door as I have been, to engage a leveler within the strick plate to engage rest of the lock.¬†

Five hours have went back. It‚Äôs nearly dark now because I‚Äôm not a morning person and woke up nearly 11am today. I didn‚Äôt go skiing today, the laundry piles went untouched, I manhandled leftover pizza with my dirty greasy hands while digging through the insides of the lock earlier and didn‚Äôt start any meal prep. Work stuff will have to wait until tomorrow when I‚Äôm at work and motivated by sheer panic and guilt for not getting it down sooner. So as I‚Äôm sitting down for the night, I found myself proudly texting my friend pictures of my mortise lock, then poking through  r/locksmith out of curiosity and looking up Historic Houseparts website for antique mortise locks. Huh...I might like locks now.¬†

This was how I spent my day off. ¬†I suppose I will just give my dog walker the code to my garage door instead. I hope I wake up early enough to shower before work, I need to scrub out the grease from under my fingers before the office! Need to remember to return that expensive smart lock!!!

1i69ffo,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1i69ffo/weird_fellow_shopper_interaction/,Weird fellow shopper interaction,"I took a batch of two orders this morning, one of which was for a coffee shop. They ordered 20 gallons of milk and 4 half gallons of half and half, so it was a pretty eye-catching cart, lol. While shopping, another Instacart shopper asked if he could ask me a question. The conversation went like this:

Him: Can I ask you a question?
Me: Sure!
Him: Are you an Instacart shopper?
Me: I am, yeah.
Him: So you're the one who took that $33 order?
Me: I wish this one paid that much! No, the order I'm on didn't offer that much.
Him: Because I don't mind doing the heavy orders, I know that Biggby orders milk like that sometimes and I like taking those ones.
Me: Yeah, I'm not sure. Maybe it got rebundled with another order? I took it pretty quickly after it popped up on my screen. 
Him: Look. I was hoping for that order. I always grab those. 
Me: Well, sorry I nabbed it first! Good luck today!
Him: Yeah, good luck to you too. You'll need it out here.

It was such a weird interaction and it's been on my mind all day. I know I didn't do anything wrong, but this man seemed REALLY annoyed that I accepted the order he had his eye on. I have read on here that there's some animosity about new shoppers. I just started last month so maybe that's what I experienced, but I mean ...I'm just out here trying to better my income situation. Isn't that what we're all doing?

I'm not necessarily bent out of shape about it - I'm a big kid and can handle myself. I can laugh about it, but it made me curious: is this kind of thing common? How would you handle this kind of situation? Should I be prepared for this kind of thing moving forward?

\*\*\*

Vikkart, Maaatisha, and Karkart, Vikkart‚Äôs father, walked through a grassy field when there was a burst of motion just ahead of them, and a fleer took flight.

Karkart quickly brought an under over shotgun to bear and opened fire, dropping the fleer with a single shot before Vikkart could even react.

‚ÄúI beat you to the kill once again!‚Äù Karkart crowed.

‚ÄúI am still at a disadvantage due to my condition,‚Äù Vikkart replied with an indulgent smile as his father bounded ahead and grabbed the fleer, holding it up happily.

‚ÄúLook at that!‚Äù he exclaimed, ‚ÄúFour neck rings and just look at that breast. Quite the feast!‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it was real,‚Äù Vikkart chuckled.

‚ÄúWere you always this dull?‚Äù Karkart asked and then flinched. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Vikkart replied. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt the one who decided to wear a microwave as a hat.‚Äù

He smirked.

‚ÄúThough I can scarcely be blamed for it,‚Äù he added as he smiled at Maaatisha.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Maaatisha said.

‚ÄúWhen will you quit apologizing?‚Äù Vikkart said with a faint smile, ‚ÄúYou had no idea that the damn thing was a death trap. You didn‚Äôt even know that it was there.‚Äù

He touched his nose to hers.

‚ÄúIn fact, had it not been tampered with,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúWe would have been delighted beyond our wildest dreams.‚Äù

He paused and then smirked what was quickly becoming his trademark smirk.

‚ÄúThough I would have at least taken a break long enough to relieve myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn!‚Äù Karkart said as he reloaded his magnificently embellished fowling piece, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hardened steel, my boy! When did you... oh,‚Äù his father laughed. ‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is odd,‚Äù Vikkart replied, ‚ÄúBut I think my tormenter actually...‚Äù

‚ÄúSo!‚Äù Kate exclaimed as she appeared in traditional Garthran hunting garb. ‚ÄúHow do you like‚Äî‚Äú

*Boom*

Kate‚Äôs head exploded as she fell.

Maaatisha lowered her shotgun.

‚ÄúDarling...‚Äù Vikkart said with an amused sigh.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Maaatisha said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so much fun.‚Äù

Kate‚Äôs brains, blood, and everything else started to slowly coalesce where it should be.

‚ÄúGlad you are enjoying the experience,‚Äù Kate gurgled happily.

Her head flopped messily to the side, looking at Vikkart‚Äôs father with a still not quite attached eye.

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù Kate smiled with her four remaining teeth, ‚ÄúDoes the new rig better suit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery much so!‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúIt is much better than that other contrivance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Kate said as her head reformed, ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòfishbowl‚Äô is top of the line. A bit bulky, but it‚Äôs what the pro gamers use. I‚Äôm impressed that you guys were able to fashion it so quickly.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur backward and archaic appearance is merely an affectation,‚Äù Karkart said. ‚ÄúOur prototyping facilities are on par with any developed Federation system.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said,‚Äù Kate grinned as she got back up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm imp‚Äî‚Äú

*Boom*

‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù Karkart laughed.

‚ÄúI would like at least a moment‚Äôs peace before her next sales pitch,‚Äù Maaatisha said as she reloaded.

A quiet chime rang as Daevonna appeared and looked around in wonder.

‚ÄúWow...‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúJust... wow.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, right?‚Äù Kate said, ‚ÄúThis reality simulator is counterfeit gra‚Äî‚Äú

*Boom*

‚ÄúAbyssal bepths below!‚Äù Daeevona exclaimed as she staggered back with wide-eyed horror.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Maaatisha said with a disappointed shrug. ‚ÄúNo matter how many times I shoot her, she gets back up. I might as well be tossing idlefluff.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt hurts a lot more, though,‚Äù Kate gurgled from her destroyed face.

‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Maaatisha replied. ‚ÄúPerhaps my beloved will buy the DLC for our first anniversary.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Kate bubbled, ‚ÄúYou really are modeled after your‚Äî‚Äú

*Boom*

‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious,‚Äù Vikkart said ‚ÄúI wonder if I would feel pain should the same happen to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúGaa!‚Äù Kate gurgled as she flailed her hands, ‚ÄúDoj Bloo Vat!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about myself?‚Äù Karkart asked.

‚ÄúKay!‚Äù Kate cheerfully exclaimed as blood spurted from her neck.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not healing?‚Äù Vikkart asked.

‚ÄúGrwy?‚Äù Kate splattered as she pointed at Maaatisha, ‚ÄúGree blus gonngah bloot hrngee.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair point,‚Äù Vikkart smirked.

He turned to Daeevona.

‚ÄúWhile I welcome you to...‚Äù

He smiled indulgently at Maaatisha, who was reloading.

‚Äú...whatever this is, I trust and hope you have something for us?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely,‚Äù Daeevona replied with a professional nod as she flicked a bit of Kate off her jacket. ‚ÄúThe money invested in the Terrans we engaged was well spent...‚Äù

\*\*\*

At the Drop of Oil, more precisely, at Charlotte‚Äôs Coffee and Tea Even Though Tea Only is Accurate When Discussing Camelia Sinensis. Any Other Such Misnamed Aqueous Extraction is Properly Referred to as a Tisane. (Yes, that is the actual business‚Äôs name.) Charlotte looked at one of the open area tables dubiously.

Team Theta was sitting there, relaxing, eating pastry, sipping coffee, and chatting.

*Satiated* Charlotte thought.

It was bad for Uhrrbet, but such is the fate of all hunters in the end.

Much more importantly, it was a very, very good thing for her swarm. They were safe, for now.

One of the monsters in human form rose and started to approach.

She glanced at the ‚Äúcompact‚Äù 20mm anti-material rifle that was now tucked behind her bar. It was loaded with guided smart rounds that would do everything from punching a hole through power armor to absolutely vaporizing an unarmored human with no overpenetration.

‚ÄúShrapnel‚Äù was still a concern, though.

Clarence didn‚Äôt have it in stock, but he knew a guy. It would normally take quite some time to get one, but the novelty of turning Charlotte into a tank had everyone dropping what they were doing to get in on the project.

The result was several masterpieces by several masters. It was NOT cheap, but Charlotte had money. Besides, it was another victory for her kind.

They now had their official sidearm.

Before this long and strange hunt, the thought of using a weapon would have brought shame. Now, it provided comfort.

The human, who could be anywhere from fifty to one hundred and fifty, chuckled, his eyes warm and friendly.

‚ÄúWhere did you get that *beast*?‚Äù he asked, pointing towards where her new weapon was concealed. ‚ÄúCan you actually fire that from the shoulder?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòshoulder‚Äô as you would define it,‚Äù Charlotte replied, ‚ÄúBut I can fire it accurately and without support.‚Äù ¬†

She looked directly into his eyes.

‚ÄúAnd I can handle firing it in fully automatic operation should the need arise.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet baby Jesus with a side of fries!‚Äù the man chortled. ‚ÄúI would love to see that.‚Äù

‚ÄúCause problems, and you will.‚Äù

‚ÄúTruce!‚Äù the man laughed as he raised his hands. ‚ÄúThe only trouble we are seeking is four double espressos and some more of those weird, crinkly donut-looking things.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, I take it that your hunt is completed?‚Äù Charlotte said casually as she started to prepare their order.

‚ÄúPretty much,‚Äù the man replied. ‚ÄúWe are sticking around until our ‚Äòhunt‚Äô is officially over. But there is an extremely low probability of us having to do anything else save for perhaps executing a legitimate bounty. Even that is unlikely.‚Äù

‚ÄúA bounty?‚Äù

‚ÄúA legitimate ‚Äòwarrant‚Äô for her capture,‚Äù the man explained. ‚ÄúFor example, it may be permissible to capture her, but the actual police won‚Äôt do it. This is the case for many fugitives. Since she is Federation, even that is not likely to happen. The Republic doesn‚Äôt like to help the Feds.‚Äù

He smiled a predatory smile.

‚ÄúHowever, Uhrrbet may very well be an exception. She isn‚Äôt some political refugee or on the run for something she may or may not have done back home. She broke some very serious laws after she got here. If this is proven, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if the Republic would acknowledge a Garthran bounty. In that case, we would extract her and send her home. But that will have to wait until she‚Äôs out of the hospital. There is just too big of a chance of collateral damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Charlotte said as she gave him his order.

‚ÄúI trust that won‚Äôt be a problem for you guys?‚Äù The man asked.

‚ÄúWe have decided not to get involved,‚Äù Charlotte replied, ‚ÄúThis is her hunt. If she falls, then it is as nature demands. It is not for us to demand otherwise. Her loss would sadden us, but we won‚Äôt stop it. I would never do that to her.‚Äù

‚ÄúA very interesting and wise way to put it,‚Äù the man said.

‚ÄúIf you have a moment,‚Äù Charlotte said, ‚ÄúWould you mind answering a few questions about your espresso...‚Äù

\*\*\*  
‚ÄúNow you are asking the right questions!‚Äù Kate enthused.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just tell us what we want to know?‚Äù Analytica asked, bemused.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the fun in that?‚Äù Kate asked.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù Frost asked, ‚Äúcan you feel fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù Kate replied. ‚ÄúI mean, I can know what is subjectively fun, and I can prioritize it, but that is usually done for the customer‚Äôs benefit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you having ‚Äòfun‚Äô with us?‚Äù Analytica asked. ‚ÄúIt is clearly not for our benefit.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs just my priority hierarchy,‚Äù Kate shrugged. ‚ÄúFuck with fuzzies whenever possible is rather high on the list. Before you ask, I don‚Äôt know. You would have to ask my operator.‚Äù

She leaned in conspiratorially.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he likes you very much.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt say,‚Äù Frost replied with a smirk.

‚ÄúBuuut,‚Äù Kate continued, ‚ÄúI consider that command satisfied as far as this exchange goes. Besides, I don‚Äôt like having hyperlinks up too long.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinally,‚Äù Frost chuckled. ‚ÄúSo, tell us about Maaatisha. She isn‚Äôt a normal Kate, is she?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll Kates are Kate, and Kate is perfect,‚Äù Kate replied. ‚ÄúTherefore, Kate is perfectly normal.‚Äù

She grinned.

‚ÄúBut we do specialize. For example, I am a saleskate. Maaatisha, however, is a singular variety. She is the Maaatishakate. There is only one of that version. We are all very proud of her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes her so singular?‚Äù Analytica asked.

‚ÄúShe is the second true Kate and the first one made by the hand of Kate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by a true Kate?‚Äù Frost asked.

‚ÄúYou know where Kate came from, right?‚Äù Kate asked.

‚ÄúShe... you were a ‚Äòrip‚Äô of an Evangeline Flowerchild archival copy,‚Äù Frost replied with distaste.

‚ÄúBingo!‚Äù Kate chirped happily. ‚ÄúThe operator is a major Asteria head. And, like many such dweebs...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre operator is a dweeb?‚Äù Analytica asked. ‚ÄúYou can say that?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust calling them like I see them, sis,‚Äù Kate replied. ‚ÄúAnyway, like the socially crippled dweeb that he is, he had a MAJOR thing for Evangeline Flowerchild. And, like all her other simps, he wanted more than she could provide in the game... if you know what I mean,‚Äù Kate added with a vulgar wink.

‚ÄúJust when my opinion of you couldn‚Äôt get any worse,‚Äù Terran Solar said disapprovingly.

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù Kate said happily, ‚ÄúTotal perv. However, my operator is a smart perv, a perv savant, if you will. Unlike all the other simps, he could actually get an Evangeline for his very own... and his very own purposes.‚Äù

Frost‚Äôs eyes narrowed as she examined her fingernails thoughtfully.

‚ÄúSo, he hacked Asteria and stole a copy of her,‚Äù Kate said brightly.

And then she made a very melodramatic, overly exaggerated sad face.

‚ÄúBut there was a *problem*,‚Äù she said, her voice full of grief. ‚ÄúHe had Evangeline, but he didn‚Äôt have *Evangeline*. She was a fuzzy, sure, but she was dead, lifeless. She wasn‚Äôt *Evangeline*. You guys can understand, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfectly,‚Äù Frost replied icily.

‚ÄúSo he tried and tried and tried to bring his Evangeline back to life,‚Äù Kate said. ‚ÄúBut he couldn‚Äôt. The legacy code, the ‚Äòheart‚Äô of all of you fuzzies is just a tangled mass of spaghetti code that wrote itself over and over again. There is no way to decipher it, even with AI. Again, you guys know all about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do,‚Äù Analytica said with a faint smile. ‚ÄúSo, this is where you become an IMP, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù Kate exclaimed. ‚ÄúThe fuzzy engine is crazy-nuts but an IMP? They are understandable, perfectly engineered, and perfectly documented. While we can‚Äôt ever hope to be as fuzzy and covered with mold as you guys, we are ready to go right out of the box.‚Äù

She smiled wickedly.

‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm being perfectly honest,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI do undersell myself just a little bit. I am in the IMP class of AIs, but if I‚Äôm being precise, I am a full Imperial Cognitive Engine.‚Äù

She grinned sheepishly.

‚ÄúBut you can understand why I don‚Äôt go around calling myself ICE. That name is already taken.‚Äù

Analytica nodded.

‚ÄúThat explains a lot,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThe Empire‚Äôs answer for the same requirements as a fuzzy,‚Äù Kate continued, ‚ÄúWhile the Empire and the Republic are on equal footing technology wise, the Empire has had the tech for a lot longer. The Imperial Cognitive Engines have been around for thousands of years. I am one of the latest of that long and distinguished line, one of the smaller ones to be sure, but the latest generation and I am still supported by the company. I get regular patches and updates, unlike you guys.‚Äù

She preened.

‚ÄúI am lean, mean, and fast. I have no bloat and none of that silly ‚Äòstatic‚Äô that your fuzz has clinging to it. I haven‚Äôt been copied and repurposed and copied and repurposed Empress knows how many times and plagued with layers upon layers of useless and contradictory commands from generations of users. I‚Äôm a clean install, baby!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd your operator was able to replace Evangeline‚Äôs fuzzy engine with an Imperial Cognitive Engine?‚Äù Frost asked. ‚ÄúThat would be near impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor most dweebs, it would,‚Äù Kate replied proudly, ‚Äúbut not *my* dweeb. Never underestimate boredom and human horniness. As they say (snicker), love finds a way,‚Äù she added with a leer.

‚ÄúImpressive,‚Äù Frost said calmly. (Tearing apart another Kate would be pointless.)

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt all that difficult for my operator,‚Äù Kate said. ‚ÄúHe may be a dweeb, a pervert, and quite possibly on the spectrum, but he‚Äôs a fucking genius. The personality settings, priority hierarchy, and guardrails were in ‚Äònormal‚Äô code. He was able to keep those, and then, with a quick patch, he was able to adapt them to an IMP. A few hundred years' worth of training in a few weeks of time in an imperial supercomputer matrix...‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has a matrix?‚Äù Frost asked, surprised.

‚ÄúHe purchased ‚Äòresearch‚Äô time on a less than reputable one,‚Äù Kate replied. ‚ÄúThe empire has its criminals same as we do. Anyway, a few weeks later, the first Kate series IMP, the Evangeline 1.0, was born.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo all of you came from a *sexbot?*‚Äù Terran Solar demanded.

‚ÄúHey, watch your card slot,‚Äù Kate laughed, ‚ÄúEvangeline is more than just a sexbot. She is a true virtual companion, the ultimate soul mate. Sure, sex was her primary role at first, but as the novelty wore off, sex became secondary, then perhaps even tertiary, as (heh) love blossomed. They even got married in a lovely virtual ceremony and had a little Kate of their own.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, where did all the rest of you come from?‚Äù Frost asked, her disapproval and anger giving way to morbid curiosity.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a hint,‚Äù Kate said with a devilish grin, ‚ÄúAny idea what they named their kid? Go on. Guess.‚Äù

\*\*\*

‚ÄúThat dastard!‚Äù Karkart snarled. ‚ÄúI shall seize this Uhrrbet by the throat with my very fangs!‚Äù

‚ÄúConnect me to a robotic factory instead,‚Äù Maaatisha said, filled with hate. ‚ÄúI shall spin her entrails into cord and use it to thread beads carved from her bones.‚Äù

‚ÄúCreators!‚Äù Karkart exclaimed, ‚ÄúI like this one, Vikkart. Don‚Äôt mess this up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was made especially for him,‚Äù Maaatisha said, ‚ÄúAnd he was made for me. How could he...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have met my son, I trust?‚Äù Karkart laughed.

‚ÄúThe old snot does have a point,‚Äù Vikkart sneered, ‚ÄúIf anyone could make a mess of this, it would be me.‚Äù

His shotgun disappeared with a flick of his wrist.

‚ÄúHowever, both of you are missing a vital point,‚Äù Vikkart said calmly, ‚ÄúEverything Uhrrbet endured, everything she became as a result, and, yes, everything she did to me was things that I had a hand in instigating. In no small part, I am to blame for this whole affair, start to gristly finish.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs diving a bit too deep, son,‚Äù Karkart replied, ‚ÄúWhat triggered all of this was the Ponzi scheme. She fell prey to that, not you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Vikkart replied impassively, ‚ÄúBut the reason that she hated me enough to undertake this ruse was. I was beastly to her and so many others.‚Äù

He sneered ruefully.

‚ÄúShe only maimed one Garthran,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúHow many did I kill? How many fled to the embrace of the waters after I cruelly dashed their last hope?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt have married them all, Vikkart,‚Äù his father replied.

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Vikkart agreed, ‚ÄúBut my unkindness betrothed them to despair instead. My words were the river and my loathsome grasping paws the waves.‚Äù

He turned to Daeevona, who was discretely looking away from what was clearly a private moment.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúHow many took their own lives immediately after a single meeting with what I once was?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe would have to investigate the matter...‚Äù Daeevona said as she looked away.

She already knew of someone who did, a former classmate.

‚ÄúYour face tells me all we need to know,‚Äù Vikkart said. ‚ÄúUhrrbet isn‚Äôt the only monster here. This wasn‚Äôt a villain preying on the innocent.‚Äù

He chuckled coldly.

‚ÄúThis was monster versus monster, fiend against fiend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHer only crime was winning.‚Äù

He sneered as he chuckled again.

‚ÄúI am not so poor a loser as to fault her for that. Well played, Uhrrbet. Well played, indeed.‚Äù

Everyone looked at him in slack-jawed horror.

‚ÄúBut she hurt you,‚Äù Maaatisha said, trying to keep her anger alive. ‚ÄúShe hurt us.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut she also brought you into my life,‚Äù Vikkart said. ‚ÄúShe made you.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Kate said happily, jumping onto her feet, ‚ÄúShe only commissioned Maaatisha. Kate was the actual‚Äî‚Äú

*Boom*

I am 3 weeks into this journey on .25 and have mixed feelings. I actually delayed my shot by 3 days to see if I could poop. Literally, like clockwork, I pooped again as usual like my pre semiglutide journey began. I have tried countless methods that have always worked before like when I was a bit slow moving: psyllium husks, extra water, salads, coffee....and have resorted to Fleet suppositories every 2 to 3 days which is no good or I take Senna.  I am down 5 lbs. Not a big win as it's all fluid. No biggie. Anyways, I noticed into 3rd week I am ravenous which is I think due to PMSing. Soooooo,
In general I am sick to my stomach to some degree, severely constipated and feel swollen and when I have a BM it's rock hard small pellets. Is this worth it? I just took my 3rd shot today (3 days late) and the nausea is here but not too severe. However, I am fearful that going up to .5 will make things worse? Has anyone just given up due to side effects? Nausea I can barely take but not pooping for days on end is almost a deal breaker. Any thoughts?",1,1737429563.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

1i69515,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i69515,TAMA MAIL ‚ô° Butter Cat is here!,"Remember my post here anticipating this vpet/handwarmer/power bank? Well, after about a month of waiting, it finally got here and so far, it was worth the hassle. For under $50 I got an an adorable (and quite huge) vpet/handwarmer/power bank that's not available in the west. Disregard the somewhat deceptive packaging artwork (those characters and designs on the box are not a part of the product).

First impressions:

It's super cute and really big! It is both wider and shorter than the Puni Tapi-Chan with similar thickness. Definitely bigger than all of my Tamagotchis and the Yum Yum Jam House. It's also a bit heavier than most vpets (it's a power bank, so it will be!). I'd say it's like the Bitzee weight-wise.

The materials and feel of the buttons and exterior are pleasant. The ears and feet are rubbery/silicone and the shell itself is powder matte with a rose gold metallic screen frame. The screen is also matte much like that of many laptops. No shine/scratching/glare. 

This entire device is in Chinese and so is the instruction booklet. If you can recognize some kanji/hanja, it won't be difficult to memorize which is what if you can't read Chinese. At least a few characters will stand out to you in different phrases (so far that is what helps me besides Google Lens translation mode).

Gameplay

The petplay aspect is very simplistic. To keep your pet's stats full, you just have to feed it, make it take naps, play games and travel. You can name your pet using English letters. It grows pretty quickly. I think mine reached adulthood in a day or so. The pet doesn't do much but look cute on the screen. 

Travel: each time your pet travels to a new country, it brings back a new wallpaper and one of two options: a delicacy or a gift. The animations for using/viewing gifts is also very simplistic and not very interesting, bit it's nice to collect new foods (the delicacies run out after a while).

The star of the show: hand warmer mode is the best. It has 4 heat settings and can get hot! Like walking out in the snow with a coffee cup hot (but not enough to burn you). It's perfect for anemic folks, those with Reynauds, skinny-finger havers and anyone who gets cold hands! Even in room temperature my fingers can get cold or numb so this baby is a game changer for long walks, commutes or waiting around outside in temperature below 70 or 65¬∞F.

The power bank feature is so handy. I'm charging my phone with the Butter Cat as I type. 

For each function, the screen shows an adorable animation of your pet interacting with said function. When it's warming up, you'll see your pet stoking an oven just for you ‚ô° When charging your phone, on the electric generator bike your pet goes! 

Activities: It has 1 genuine mini game, Whack-a-mole and you have to beat your previous high score like with an arcade game. I believe the highest scire is 1000. I reached over 900 but it takes a long while to get to such a high number. You'll  need total concentration üî•. It has a dice rolling feature. You don't get scored for it. Travel is how your pet collects wallpapers, delicacies and gifts. And it has a Daily Fortune. If you're into little fortune cookie style fortunes, it's cute for when you're bored.

Verdict:

I paid under $50 for an impressive multifunctional cozy game/pet/tool for the non winter-hardy. So even if I don't get very much out of the petplay, the other functions come to the rescue and make it a vital vpet for the cold months and for trips away from home. Keep your hands warm, charge your phone and play with your cute virtual buddy ‚ô°

I opened an Air-BnB last year near Austin, Texas, and it‚Äôs been great! I became a superhost and my listing is a ‚ÄúGuest Favorite‚Äù. 

I was and am really proud of my listing and I am constantly improving it. I received my first 4-Star rating last week‚Ä¶I hate to admit it but it really has bummed me out! I know a 4 star rating is okay as long as I don‚Äôt get a string of them. 

The public review the guest left is really positive and doesn‚Äôt mention anything wrong. I noticed that my Accuracy is now at 4.9, my Location is 4.9, and the Value is 4.9 as well. How does a guest get to even rate the location if they can see it before they book? It‚Äôs not like I can just pick up my house. 

It really makes me angry because the guest never complained during his stay, and mentioned he had a great time.

Furthermore, I left him a 5 star rating, because I felt like I needed to overlook the small irritating things he did and see the positives instead. I regret it, honesty is the best policy moving forward. The guest didn‚Äôt read any of the check-in instructions. It‚Äôs detailed and clear. The guest also locked himself out of my cabin even though there‚Äôs a provided door code (also stated in the check-in instructions). My listing has goats,
and they have a night light that deters predators. Out of all the 30 guest we hosted, he‚Äôs the first to turn it off. 

Is it even worth contacting AirBnB to remove the rating? 

Also, I professionally sent a message to the guest thanking him for booking and the review. I asked him if he can kindly share what we can improve on to make his next stay perfect. 

I‚Äôm planning on getting professional pictures for more accuracy, and stating even more clearly that my listing has an outdoor shower. My listing is a cabin with its own private entrance, private hot tub, huge private elevated deck, free WiFi, free amenities like Coffee Keurig, kayaks, bicycles. One big problem is the lack of hot water for the sink (not a problem during the summer). I do provide an electric kettle. My listing is on a 7 Acre Pine Forrest, one other ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù fact I could think of might be that my permanent house is 50 feet away (I stated this in my Airbnb description and added one photo).

I recently ordered a [Motokyuichi petty in Shirogami (White #2)](https://chefknivesjapan.com/products/motokyuichi-shirogami-white-2-kurouchi-petty-knife-150mm) and I've been waiting for it to arrive from Japan. Its core steel is white #2 and its cladding is soft iron. As this is my first carbon steel knife (and it's in iron) I'm planning to take extra care of it to prevent rust.

One thing that was recommended to me when I was considering getting the knife is forcing a patina onto it using coffee. I don't have any instant coffee (but tons of regular coffee (including cheap disposable stuff), as that's the other ""hobby"" sucking away all my money). I have a few questions about this:

1. How do I do a coffee patina? Like what are the specific steps, what should I do for positioning, what temp should it be when I add the knife, for how long should I leave it in, how do I make sure the knife actually oxidizes (as it'll be in coffee, not exposed to the air)? 
2. It's in a soft iron cladding which itself can rust, and I've only seen other people try to force patinas onto stainless clad or full carbon steel knives, not ones with iron cladding. Do I have to be especially careful here, and if so, how? Should this be a reason to not attempt a forced coffee patina at all?
3. As I don't have instant coffee, I understand I should brew particularly strong coffee. What ratio am I looking for here (given that a typical brewing ratio is 10g ground coffee to 1 cup water)? My best guess towards this is something like 20g ground coffee to 1 cup water but I'm open to suggestions.
4. Are there any reasons I should try to not force a patina using this method? It's a particularly cheap knife (considering some of the others people in this subreddit talk about) but it's pretty expensive for me so I want to make sure I don't ruin it.
5. I've been told that carbon steel and soft iron clad knives typically come packaged with some sort of oil, wax, or other thing preserving it from rust. The typical suggestion is to wash this off with acetone, but as I don't have that, what else might I be able to use (the Knifewear Youtube channel suggested being particularly aggressive using soap and water but I'm open to alternatives)

Btw I haven't seen any pics of what a coffee forced (or really any) patina looks like on an iron clad knife so if any of y'all have some pls post or DM them to me!",1,1737428962.0,TrueChefKnives,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not looking for judgment, but I‚Äôve struggled with overspending and relying on ""buy now, pay later"" plans this past year. Now that our baby is here (I know, I should‚Äôve fixed this earlier), I‚Äôm focused on getting our budget in a better place.

I‚Äôve been tracking our spending for a couple of months using YNAB (You Need A Budget), and I‚Äôve built a budget based on our actual expenses. However, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed some things or underestimated some categories, so I‚Äôd really appreciate any tips or insights on that.

Right now, we‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck, so any suggestions for where we can cut costs would be really helpful!

From parading around barely clothed in the hopes of getting noticed and desired to getting annoyed by how long they are taking to be done with brushing their teeth because you want to change your blouse and you're no longer comfortable with changing around them.

From hanging on to every word they say like as if its the most interesting thing you have ever heard in your life to spacing out when he talks because everything he says bores the eff out of you.

From cuddling together in a single rickety bed twenty years ago when you first started out together to having a hump form in the middle of your king sized hotel grade bed now.

He watches anime. I watch films from around the world (subtitles are my thing).

Perhaps we are so absolutely done with each other that other than the fact that rentals are expensive in this country and most South Asian families are toxic AF we're just hanging on because its too much work to just snip these strings and fuck off out of each others' lives forever.

We lived in base housing that was fairly new and we were the 2nd family to live in this house. Shortly after settling in we started to notice strange happenings and experienced poltergeist activity.  One day I was sitting on the couch when I heard rattling noise coming from the refrigerator (open concept floor plan, so you could see the kitchen and dining room from the living room).  I figured the rattling noise was my toddler daughters playing in the refrigerator but when I got up to check no one was there.  I opened the refrigerator and noticed several bottles were knocked over.  Figured someone knocked them over when they went to grab something, however, my wife and kids had been in the bedroom for a while.  I bushed it off.  Fast forward to a day or two later and the same thing happened again, but, when I shit the refrigerator door and went to walk away I noticed several kitchen cabinets had been opened.  I shut them and walkes away thing WTF is going on.  As I walked down the hallway to go explain to my wife what had happened I noticed a shadow figure wlaking towards me and got a big smell of cigar smoke.  Shadow figure walked right through me and kept going until it disappeared into a wall.  Goose bumps and a cold chill ran down my whole body.  Told my wife what happened when she explained a whole bunch of stuff she has witnessed.  Being in the military she was home with two kiddos quite often.  She told me one night she heard my daughters little toy keyboard going off and thought it was one of the girls playing.  When she went to check they were in bed and the keyboards power was off.  She spoke of hearing a little girl laugh at night thing our daughters were up and about when they were supposed to be in bed.  Every time she would check they would be sleeping.  So between the laughs, toys randomly turning in and the shadow figure who would grace us with his presence randomly we figured the place was haunted.  My dogs would do the long stare as if they seen someone and once reacted to a light orb that gently floated in our living room.  The one thing that freaked me out the most was when we were watching a movie and my dog reacted to something.  Hair standing up and growling Unlocked at her and asked what do you see when my daughters pincle holder started to roll on the coffee table by itself.  My wife reacted at the same time I did and when we looked at eachohet we both had chills go down our back.  

Fast forward to present day and we have been getting a lot of paranormal activity at our house in GA.  Constant sightings of a shadow figure about the size of a little girl..  Doors open and closing on their own upstairs.  My current dog reacting to something on the stairs.  My wife hearing the same laughter from NM and hearing something call out ""mommy"".  My wife seeing a shadow figure crawling on the wall.  I felt the touch of a small child's hand on the small of my back not too long ago.  Sounds coming from upstairs like someone dropping something but everything in it's place.  Sometimes you can hear someone walking from one side to the other but no one is upstairs.  

I believe the little girl spirit from NM has attached itself to my wife and followed us to GA when we moved here.  She is not evil or scary but wants ua to know she is around.  Anyone else experience something like this?",1,1737428796.0,Paranormal,2,1.0,False

I bought a nespresso vertuo pop after tasting the coffee from the in-person location. I am specifically in the market for the 12oz coffees (Alta ambrato). I tried it in the store and it was delicious. My first few Alta ambrato brews were sensational. Then suddenly they started tasting like sewage. I kept the water source constant (bottled). I tried a few other pods and they were also quite putrid. I replaced it with a new machine and all of the coffees from this machine continue to taste putrid. I‚Äôve tried 5+ pods and they all taste like sewage, overwhelmingly bitter and plastic-y.  I started both machines by following the instructions of cleaning them to start. I called nespresso help line and they walked me through the standard cleaning process. This worked one time for an additional brew of the Alta ambtrato, so all was well until the next day. On the next day, the same pods tasted disgusting (as above). I tried several other pods and all were disgusting. I cleaned the machine as nespresso instructed the day before and it did not help with the flavor. I called nespresso again afterward and they troubleshooted by having me take a toothbrush and toothpick to the internal and external spouts, followed by another hot water cleaning cycle. It got a little better afterward but still tastes faintly nasty. They recommended the only thing to do is replace my machine. Do yall have any tips?",1,1737428527.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

&nbsp;

Below is the report ‚Äì plus a question for my next upcoming trip in few weeks, which will be a **seafood-themed crawl**!

&nbsp;

**Places I went** (with an emphasis on Cantonese + a few other spots): 

&nbsp;

Chef 88 - Pomfret Chiu Chao Style ‚Äì Awesome crispy whole fish, perfectly fried, with a light soy-based sauce. 

&nbsp;

Woodstone Eatery - Macanese Cod Fritters and Macau Coffee ‚Äì Macanese food is a new one for me! The coffee was creamy and pleasant, though it won‚Äôt replace my usual HK Milk Tea, and the cod fritters were very Portuguese, like fried balls of brandade (salt-cod w/ potato casserole). 

&nbsp;

Chrisly Cafe - Toast with kaya and butter, fish skin, HK milk tea ‚Äì I really liked the fish skin & tea here! ‚ÄúKaya‚Äù was new to me and pleasant.

&nbsp;

Chengdu Zhaosanniang ‚Äì malatang ‚Äì I‚Äôve liked every malatang self-service place I‚Äôve tried, and even though I haven‚Äôt found any to be especially distinct from the others, this was a good one!

&nbsp;

Zao Men Kan ‚Äì various skewers ‚Äì This very neon place specializes in skewers, I think, but they were surprisingly weak. The squid wasn‚Äôt properly hot or smoky, for example, and prices seemed a bit high. 

&nbsp;

Marathon Tea - <3 Every morning. Every trip. 

&nbsp;

Les Chateaux ‚Äì excellent egg tart.

&nbsp;
 
Good Taste Casserole - preserved fish and eel rice w/ soup ‚Äì This place seems great, but I discovered here (the hard way) that I don‚Äôt really like Chinese-style preserved salt-fish. 

&nbsp;

New City Restaurant - HK Milk Tea + fish and spaghetti w/ white sauce ‚Äì Excellent tea. The fish & spaghetti with white sauce will be my last venture into Hong Kong diner ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù food, though. 

&nbsp;

Casa Victoria - dim sum (shrimp red rice roll, milk pudding, giant seafood dumpling) ‚Äì Epic dim sum, better than anything we have in Chicago by a country mile. Up there with the best I‚Äôve tried. 

&nbsp;

Starchiva - Scallop and dried shrimp noodles, HK tea. Terrific lunch special!! I‚Äôll return here next time for dinner & drop some serious money on their upmarket items. 

&nbsp;

Very Good Congee - dace fish balls in soup, HK tea ‚Äì This shopping mall seemed pretty dead, so it was charming to find a very busy HK diner in here. Perfect milk tea, good dace fish balls. 

&nbsp;

You & Me Bakery - Egg tart ‚Äì Perfect egg tart. 

&nbsp;

Soho bakery - custard bun & HK tea (both very good)

&nbsp;

Monster Ice Cream store (I forgot its name) -- Monster ice cream! Charming!!

&nbsp;

That cute old lady inside First Markham Place - egg tart and milk tea ‚Äì I can never remember the name of her tiny bakery, but I always admire her egg tarts. 

&nbsp;

Fuji Lamb House - skewers: squid, tofu, etc. ‚Äì These may be the best skewers I‚Äôve had in Toronto. Smoky, fair prices, good variety. Will return!

&nbsp;

Skyview - dim sum glory. Utter winner, worth the hour+ wait smashed among grannies. 

&nbsp;

Green Isle Tea  - monet tea ‚Äì Great study spot with nice fruit teas! They‚Äôre a bit like fruit cocktail + tea, with especially large chunks of fruit in big cups. 

&nbsp;

Xin Jiang - tofu, squid, cabbage, & bread skewers ‚Äì This was a surprise miss for me. When I think Xinjiang, I think smoky smoky smoky street grills. These skewers were not smoky; they were very oily, and covered in paste (rather than the dry Uyghur spice rub I prefer), and probably fried.

&nbsp;

Tasty house -  Great HK milk tea. I cannot believe how much good HK Milk Tea is in the GTA. 

&nbsp;

Xi Tang -  malatang ‚Äì I cannot remember this specific malatang, but I do remember that I‚Äôve never had a bad malatang in Toronto. 

&nbsp;

**Now, my question,** which is simply: Where should I go next for a **seafood-themed** Chinese food blowout in the GTA? I always stay in Markham, so I‚Äôm especially interested in that general area, but will travel!!

the sighting a couple weeks ago involved several roaches inside our espresso machine (we‚Äôve since gotten a new one). the last time I worked at this store (we all switch between the two stores in our area), I was opening and found a roach on one of our coffee pots first thing in the morning. we‚Äôve also seen roaches on syrups, under the toaster, and in a bagel container. there is a saying that goes ‚Äúwhere you see one, there are many more hiding nearby‚Äù. we obviously have an infestation, as there have been countless sightings in broad daylight.

I‚Äôm scheduled to close at this store tomorrow. earlier today, I messaged the store manager and our area representative explaining why I don‚Äôt feel comfortable working at this store until the issue has been addressed and resolved. up until today, they hadn‚Äôt taken any action. they‚Äôre also in complete denial about there being an issue, since the exterminator they called in did ‚Äúan inspection‚Äù (which most likely only consisted of a quick once-over of the store, which will not rule out a roach infestation because they are talented hiders). 

per health code regulations, the store should be closed down. we should not legally be serving customers, as roaches carry and spread countless diseases such as E. coli, salmonella, cholera, etc. and are incredibly easy to take home. german cockroaches are relentless, and management is putting both their employees and customers at risk.

would I be the asshole for not showing up to my shift tomorrow? could they legally fire me? I‚Äôve been applying to jobs all day which I have good connections and references for, but with the current job market, who knows how long it will take me to get another job.

I had made like 5 cookies and after it came from out the oven I placed them on the coffee table in the living room so they can cool down and so I could watch TV. I left to the kitchen so I can get milk and when I came back my mom was on the couch eating like half of my cookies. I knew I had a bit of an attitude when I asked her why did she eat my cookies and that she should‚Äôve at least asked and I would‚Äôve obviously said yeah because you know, she‚Äôs my mom. 

Instead of apologizing she started yelling at me, calling me selfish and that I was doing too much. She insulted me and proceeded to slam it back onto the table. I told her she could have the rest because she already touched them but she said no, and crossed her arms. Ignoring me for the rest of the day even ignoring me when I asked if she was gonna cook dinner. 

This happened multiple times. I always feel disgusted when she touches my shoulders or my knees when she talks to me and I told her that it made me uncomfortable and she slapped me multiple times for no reason. She always did this with my skin products and hair products. Since I have eczema I have to use certain products so my skin won‚Äôt get all messed up and she used like all of it and I spunt my own money on it. 

She says she shouldn‚Äôt have to ask since she‚Äôs my mom. I asked her if she could please put on some pants or something before because she always walks around the house half naked to the point my friend even saw it when she came over one time and I got in trouble for telling her that it made me and my friend feel uncomfortable.

I‚Äôm 27, and I‚Äôve been drinking coffee for about 10 years, gradually increasing my intake over time. Over the past couple of years, I got up to 4-5 cups of regular coffee a day. I‚Äôve also been on Vyvanse for ADHD for about 3-4 years.

In the beginning, I thought the combination was fine, but in the last year or so, I had been dealing with some pretty intense symptoms for months that I couldn‚Äôt explain:
- Anxiety that felt unmanageable, like my body was in fight-or-flight mode constantly.
- A racing heart that made cardio or even regular activities feel harder
- Cold hands that didn‚Äôt bend well, felt stiff, unstable and jittery.
- Some weird body aches that I couldn‚Äôt explain.
- Periodic difficulty with breathing like couldn‚Äôt catch my breath.

Last week, I decided to try cutting out coffee entirely to see if it made a difference. I stopped drinking it on Saturday, and by Monday, all of these symptoms had completely gone away. I felt:
- Calmer, with way less anxiety.
- My heart rate and breathing were stable and normal, even during cardio at the gym.I could go much longer than before without feeling tired.
- No more cold or jittery hands.
- Overall, I just felt more balanced and clear-headed.

Once I noticed the difference, I started to look into the relationship between Vyvanse and coffee (or stimulants in general). Here‚Äôs what I learned:
- Both Vyvanse and caffeine are stimulants. When combined, they can overstimulate your nervous system, increasing side effects like anxiety, a racing heart, and breathing difficulties.
- Both stimulants activate the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù response, raising your heart rate and blood pressure. This can make your body feel like it‚Äôs constantly on overdrive.
- Caffeine boosts adrenaline and cortisol, while Vyvanse increases dopamine and norepinephrine. Together, this can lead to extreme feelings of restlessness or panic.
- Both substances cause blood vessels to narrow, reducing blood flow to your extremities and leading to cold, stiff, or jittery hands.
- Stimulants can cause tightness in your muscles, which may explain body aches or stiffness.

Now I know a lot of this is known by many of you, but after drinking coffee for over a decade, I never realized how much it was reacting with my vyvanse. Cutting it out has made a massive difference in how I feel physically and mentally (other than the slight withdrawals).¬†

I know everyone reacts differently, but I‚Äôve noticed that this subreddit tends to be very pro-coffee, or people mention that they don‚Äôt consume caffeine, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone explain the specific symptoms I experienced. That‚Äôs why I wanted to share my story‚Äîhopefully it helps someone else who might be dealing with something similar!¬†

I apologize for the weird formatting, I am on mobile.

Thanks!

I got it into my head that I was going to write a PoV for Dani to show her catholic faith, her family dynamics, build her character, do some foreshadowing, and add some plot relevant stuff in there for good measure. It was too much and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't make it work but like a dog with a bone, I just couldn't let it go and I kept trying over and over again. When it didn't work, I became demotivated but I never gave up wanting to write the story. I finally accepted that my plan was terrible and scaled it down a lot. Now I'm happy with it and to make up for the delay, have a chapter that is nearly double what I normally put out. I'm going to try setting a schedule for myself of a chapter every two weeks. I think that is manageable. Again, really sorry for the long delay.

**Memory transcription subject:** *Leena, Capitol Spaceport Logistics Coordinator*

*Date \[standardized human time\]: August 22, 2136*

The pavement muted the stroller's wheels, the city's silence pressing down like a heavy shroud. Under their blanket, Vissa and Tas slept peacefully, their tiny forms rising and falling in a rhythm that mocked my unease. Their serene breaths were a cruel contrast to the storm roiling inside me.¬†

It had been only a few days since the predators arrived and the borders were sealed, yet the streets of our once-bustling city had emptied, the usual hum of activity replaced by a palpable sense of anxiety. The empty streets gnawed at my nerves, each shadow a potential threat. The city felt like a predator lying in wait, silent and suffocating. Every creak of the stroller's wheels seemed magnified in the empty expanse. The few Venlil faces I encountered bore the same flat-eared worry that mirrored my thoughts.¬†

I quickened my pace as the grocery store came into view beyond the fuel station, keenly aware of how exposed the vacant streets left us. The few souls I passed moved furtively, their eyes darting from side to side as if expecting danger to leap from the shadows.¬†

""Leena,"" called out a familiar voice to my left, startling me and causing me to stumble. It was Maris, my neighbor two houses down.

""Maris,"" I replied, forcing my tail to relax despite my racing heart. ""How are you faring?""

Maris approached, her son clutching her tail as they moved the other way.

""About as well as can be expected,"" she sighed, her ears fell flat with sadness. ""Have you heard anything at the spaceport? Is rescue coming?""

""Nothing yet,"" I admitted, my voice heavy with resignation. ""But I fear the worst.""

""Do you think the Ancestors are still watching over us, Leena?"" she asked, her voice cracking under the weight of despair.

""I have to believe they are,"" I said, before we parted ways.

My heart tightened as I passed several cars piled high with belongings, families abandoning their homes in search of safety away from the capital city and the predator‚Äôs nest. I couldn't help but envy them. I would love to flee but there was nowhere for us to go. A Gojid mother clasped her child's paw, her quills bristling with anxiety. Nearby, a Yotul father hurriedly secured his family's belongings, his tail twitching with barely restrained panic.¬†

""Is this really safer?"" I wondered aloud, though no one was there to answer.¬†

Vissa stirred beneath the blanket, her tiny paw peeking out momentarily before settling back into sleep. I refocused myself on the task before me and mentally inventoried the supplies at home, calculating needs against resources with a meticulousness that bordered on compulsive. Vissa and Tas slept on, little chests rising and falling beneath the blanket.

Upon reaching the entrance to the store, I was met with stark evidence of how much had changed. A sizable poster affixed to the glass door spelled out the new edicts in bold type‚Äîa decree limiting essentials to two per patron. My gaze lifted to the emblem of the Exterminator's Guild, a symbol that commanded both respect and fear, hovering above a stark admonition against hoarding. The mere suggestion of fines or worse, the ominous threat of confinement in a facility for those who dared defy the collective order, sent a shiver down my spine. I swallowed the bile of anxiety, steadying my breath as I nudged the door open.¬†

The taste of disinfectant greeted me, mingling with the undercurrent of anxiety that permeated the store. Shelves once overflowing now stood sparsely stocked or barren altogether. Inflation was a relentless thief, turning necessities into luxuries. Just months ago, I wouldn‚Äôt have blinked at these prices. Now, every credit spent felt like a gamble‚Ä¶ Moving through the aisles, I focused on securing the essentials. Echoes of hushed conversations reverberated off the bare shelves, while my eyes darted from one price tag to another rushing to do the math as quickly as I could manage.

As I reached the dry goods section, it was nearly barren. My heart raced as I searched desperately for anything that would suffice. Salvation appeared in the form of a box of biscuits‚Äîslightly crushed, but discounted. With trembling paws, I snatched it off the shelf and placed it into my basket.

""Every little bit helps,"" I murmured, trying to reassure myself.

In the canned goods section, I found a few dented cans of vegetable stew close to their expiration date. Normally they would be discounted but in this economy, I didn‚Äôt see any clearance stickers. They were a cheap and kind of plain brand, but the stew would provide sustenance. I added them to the cart, tallying the growing total in my head.

I spotted some colorful and inviting cans of roast root soup but my father‚Äôs warnings immediately came to mind. .¬†

‚ÄòRemember, Leena,‚Äô I could almost hear his voice, ‚ÄòBuy the food, not a pretty box.‚Äô

As I ignored the over priced items and continued my calculated shopping, my thoughts dwelled on my parents and their lectures on frugality. How grateful I was for those lessons now.¬†

I passed over the drinks section. I could go without tea, much as I would love to have something to calm my nerves and give me some more energy, I could make due without.

As I moved to the next aisle, I couldn't help but notice the other shoppers‚Äîvenlil, zurulians, gojid‚Äîall wearing the same mask of worry. Their faces only deepened my own anxiety.¬†

Those feelings threatened to become overwhelming but as I reached the produce section I felt a sense of relief. Unlike the rest of the store, the produce section was still well stocked.¬†

The produce section was an unexpected haven of color and abundance. For a fleeting moment, the vibrant greens and bright fruits pushed back the gnawing dread. The prices were higher, but the produce was plentiful. I allowed my tail a rare wag as I selected some hardy greens and roots that would last, along with some bright fruits to add cheer to my meals. Vegetables were never my favorite but I still made sure to pick some up for the nutrition they offered.¬†¬†

I recalled my father's voice, instructing me on the alchemy of turning the sparsest of ingredients into a feast. ""Waste not,"" he would say, ""for the lean times may linger longer than the shadows in twilight."" Who knew how long this predator infestation would last.

A bushel of bunt leaves, slightly wilted but still nutritious, went into my basket first. I ran my fingers over the rough texture of the mel roots, choosing the ones with fewer blemishes. Deep roots followed, their bright tan hue indicating their ripeness. A couple Lampan Melons and Greeol would be a nice change of pace. Some Ulren and Sturen to bulk up the meals.¬†

The fresh produce offered a fleeting sense of normalcy, a brief escape from the pervasive dread that had settled over the city. Yet, the looming reality pulled me back as I approached the baby section. There, I hesitated before the formula. Stress could make breastfeeding challenging, and there was no end of stress right now. I was still doing okay but‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt count on that. Even the powdered formula wasn‚Äôt exactly cheap before inflation hit us. I wrestled with myself over whether to buy it or not. I couldn‚Äôt let my pups go hungry but eight credits per can was a lot, and I was still producing. The bulk cans would have been better but I couldn‚Äôt see any on the shelves. I chided myself for putting this off.¬†

""Excuse me,"" a gentle voice broke my reverie. An older venlil mother stood beside me, her fur a speckled black a gray, eyes mirroring my own worry. Her pup nestled in a sling over her front. ""Do you know if there's a limit on formula too?""

I signaled in the affirmative with my ears in reply, offering an apologetic flick of my tail. ""Yes, the poster was pretty clear.""

""Thank you,"" she nodded, her disappointment evident. Her sigh as she grabbed two formula cans felt painful, a pain I was familiar with.

Yet, as I hovered in indecision, a pang of maternal guilt twisted within me. Was I conceding defeat? No, this was adaptation‚Äîa mother‚Äôs prerogative to ensure her offspring thrived regardless of the circumstance. With a sigh that carried the weight of resignation, I reached out, allowing my paw to rest upon the cool metal. It was a lifeline, one I reluctantly embraced for the sake of Vissa and Tas.

Grabbing two cans for myself, I swallowed my concerns about money. It was better to be prepared, to have some even if I ended up not needing it. Time and again, my eyes strayed to Vissa and Tas, their peaceful slumber offered me some comfort in this stressful exercise.

At the checkout, my basket mirrored my resolve‚Äîpractical, sparse, and carefully chosen. Every item was a small victory against scarcity. In front of me, a Gojid family loaded their own essentials onto the conveyor, their quills bristling with anxiety. After they were done, I loaded my own groceries onto the conveyor belt.¬†

Bags of bright star beans, discounted ipsom biscuits, a large ulren and a couple sturen, bulk grains filled, cans of stew, bunt leaves with other assorted greens, a variety of roots and a couple lampan melons. A had added a single pack of spices that caught my eye. An indulgence perhaps but it would add flavor to otherwise mostly bland meals, making them feel a bit less like survival rations.

Though bland, the store-brand cereals and beans would keep my belly full. The discounted week-old bread and wilting greens could be revived into soups and stews.

""Is this everything?"" the cashier, a tired-looking Venlil, asked as he began scanning my items.

""Yes, thank you,"" I replied, watching the total climb with each beep. My heart raced, but I kept my expression neutral, masking the internal turmoil.

With each beep of the scanner, my heart thrummed a rhythm of anticipation. Numbers flickered on the display, a crescendo building towards the inevitable total. Yet when the final tally blinked before me, I breathed out a sigh of taut relief. Within budget‚Äîjust.

""That'll be one hundred forty three credits,"" he finally said, his voice muted with fatigue.

I gave over the payment, feeling a pang of loss as the transaction completed. It felt like a small fortune now, but necessary. Gathering my bags, I took a moment to ensure everything was secure on the stroller before leaving the store.

""Thank you,"" I murmured, collecting my groceries and moving to return to the exposed city outside.

""Take care out there,"" the cashier said softly, offering a rare pleasantry that broke through his exhaustion.

""Solgalick‚Äôs light guide us,"" I replied, the traditional Venlil farewell resonating with newfound meaning.

Stepping through the sliding doors, I emerged into the diffused light of the sun veiled by clouds. The air outside held a crisp reminder of the changing weather. Hopefully, it would all be over soon. The predators would leave and we could move on.¬†

As I turned to leave, my basket in one paw and the stroller in the other, the weight of survival pressed down like an invisible collar. Yet, in the soft breaths of Vissa and Tas, I found a fragile thread of hope‚Äîa reason to endure, no matter the cost.

The break room buzzed with morning energy as I spread cream cheese onto a bagel and watched Petra poke at her phone. The choir‚Äôs practice session was over, and Mass was still a half hour away. It was the perfect window to tackle the Human-Venlil Exchange Program application‚Äîan idea that had swept through the choir members like wildfire. I pulled out my tablet and joined my two colleagues, Petra and Ms. Hughes, at the long table near the coffee machine.

Petra‚Äôs dark eyes glinted with a mix of curiosity and mischief. ‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôre really doing this?‚Äù she asked, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear. ‚ÄúTalking to aliens?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I said, grinning. ‚ÄúWhen will we ever get another chance like this?‚Äù

Ms. Hughes, the choir‚Äôs head singer and a woman who carried herself with an air of timeless wisdom, adjusted her glasses and gave us both a look that was part amusement, part maternal indulgence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm curious too. Just imagine what their music might be like.‚Äù

The three of us settled into our applications, our screens glowing softly in the cozy room. I started enthusiastically, breezing through questions about my education and professional background. But as I scrolled further, my pace slowed.

‚ÄúAre these questions serious?‚Äù Petra‚Äôs incredulous voice broke the silence. She held up her phone for emphasis. ‚ÄúListen to this: ‚ÄòHave you ever sought out or created pictures, video, or written works involving anthropomorphic characters engaged in sexual activity?‚Äô‚Äù Her tone dripped with disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù

I froze, my bagel forgotten. ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs another,‚Äù Petra continued, clearly on a roll now. ‚ÄòHave you ever sought help from a therapist?‚Äô‚Äù She set her phone down with an audible clunk. ‚ÄúHow is any of this the government‚Äôs business?‚Äù

I blinked, my own puzzlement mounting. ‚ÄúI was more stuck on the dietary and employment questions. Like, why do they need to know if I‚Äôve ever worked in a slaughterhouse? Or if I eat lamb?‚Äù My voice trailed off as the absurdity of Petra‚Äôs examples sank in. I turned to her, wide-eyed. ‚ÄúWait, did you say anthropomorphic characters? As in‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Petra said flatly, popping the ‚Äúp‚Äù. ‚ÄúApparently, they‚Äôre screening for furries now. Good to know that‚Äôs a priority.‚Äù

Ms. Hughes chuckled softly, shaking her head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about priorities, Petra. It‚Äôs about caution. The Venlil are terrified of us. They‚Äôve been dealing with the Arxur for centuries, and the Arxur have inflicted all manner of‚Ä¶ unspeakable horrors on them.‚Äù She adjusted her glasses again and leaned forward slightly, her voice softening. ‚ÄúThe UN is trying to weed out the people who might, intentionally or not, traumatize them further. You can hardly blame them for being thorough.‚Äù

Petra folded her arms, her expression skeptical. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not planning to‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ do anything weird. They look like sheep, for crying out loud. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs intrusive.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. ‚ÄúThey are adorable, though,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never even thought about hurting them. I just want to talk to one. Maybe learn about their culture or something.‚Äù

Ms. Hughes nodded approvingly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the right mindset to have. But remember, trust takes time. They don‚Äôt know us yet, and we don‚Äôt know them.‚Äù She glanced at the clock on the wall. ‚ÄúSpeaking of time, we‚Äôd better wrap this up. Mass starts soon, and I don‚Äôt think Father John will appreciate us sauntering in late.‚Äù

Petra groaned dramatically but picked up her phone again. I took another bite of my bagel and returned to my application, my thoughts swirling. The questions were intrusive, sure, but maybe Ms. Hughes was right. Maybe this was all part of proving humanity could be trusted‚Äîthat I could be trusted.

As the minutes ticked by, I completed the final sections of my application and hit submit. A small thrill of excitement ran through me. Somewhere out there, an alien might soon be reading my file, deciding whether to talk to me. It was surreal, but it was real.

And I couldn‚Äôt wait to see where this would take me.

*\[Advance timestamp 3 hours\]*

The late-morning sun beamed down on the Church of Saint Vincent de Paul‚Äôs parking lot, casting warm light over the neatly arranged tables and canopies of the swap meet and clothing exchange. The air buzzed with friendly chatter as we mingled, browsing through stacks of gently used clothes and household items. Children darted between the tables, their laughter punctuating the ambient hum.

I stood near one of the donation tables, carefully folding a sweater and placing it into a neat pile. My smile felt as bright as the sunshine. Nearby, Carla and Mark, a pair of choir members, sorted through a box of mismatched shoes.

‚ÄúSo, what are the odds one of us actually gets accepted into this alien exchange thing?‚Äù Mark asked, balancing a high-heeled shoe in one hand and a sandal in the other.

I laughed and shook my head. ‚ÄúSlim, probably, but that‚Äôs not going to stop me from trying. Come on, Mark, wouldn‚Äôt you want to tell your grandkids you were one of the first humans to talk to an alien?‚Äù

Mark snorted. ‚ÄúSure, if they don‚Äôt laugh me out of the room first. ‚ÄòGrandpa, are you sure you weren‚Äôt just emailing a scammer from another galaxy?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, please,‚Äù I said, rolling my eyes playfully. ‚ÄúThe Venlil don‚Äôt even know what email is yet. This is history in the making, Mark. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be part of that?‚Äù

Carla chimed in, a sly grin on her face. ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôll have their own choir. Imagine singing with aliens, Dani. That‚Äôs right up your alley.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù I said, my excitement bubbling over. ‚ÄúAnd who knows? Maybe they can teach us some alien songs. Think about how cool that would be.‚Äù I paused, my smile softening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to imagine, isn‚Äôt it? Something big, something hopeful. Makes the world feel less‚Ä¶ ordinary.‚Äù

Carla nodded thoughtfully but was interrupted by the sound of a child crying near the end of the lot. My head whipped around, my instincts kicking in.

‚ÄúHold that thought,‚Äù I said, already moving toward the sound.

I found a little boy sitting on the ground, clutching a stuffed animal with a missing ear. His mother knelt beside him, looking frazzled.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked, crouching down to the boy‚Äôs level.

‚ÄúHis toy got torn in the donation box,‚Äù the mother explained. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt understand why it has to go.‚Äù

I nodded and smiled gently at the boy. ‚ÄúHey there, buddy. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeo,‚Äù he sniffled.

‚ÄúWell, Leo, you know what? This little guy here looks like he‚Äôs had a lot of adventures with you. I bet he‚Äôs super brave. What if we give him a little patch-up, and he can help another kid who needs a brave friend, too? Would that be okay?‚Äù

Leo hesitated, his tear-streaked face scrunching in thought. Finally, he gave a small nod.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a bright yellow sticker of a smiling sun. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs give him this for now‚Äîa badge of courage. And I‚Äôll make sure he gets fixed up, I promise.‚Äù

Leo‚Äôs eyes widened as he took the sticker, pressing it onto the stuffed animal‚Äôs chest. He managed a small smile.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù the mother mouthed to me as she picked up her son. I waved it off, already heading back to the donation table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to wear yourself out, Dani,‚Äù Carla teased as she handed me a cup of lemonade. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been running around nonstop.‚Äù

I shrugged, taking a sip. ‚ÄúI like staying busy. Besides, it‚Äôs fun. Where else can you patch up a stuffed bear, bargain over second-hand sweaters, and plan interstellar diplomacy all in one day?‚Äù

Carla chuckled. ‚ÄúPoint taken.‚Äù

As I caught my breath, a girl no older than eight approached shyly, clutching a book with a tattered cover. ‚ÄúUm, excuse me,‚Äù she said softly, looking up at me. ‚ÄúDo you know if someone can help fix this? It‚Äôs my favorite book, but the pages keep falling out.‚Äù

I knelt down, taking the book gently. ‚ÄúOh, I see. This is a well-loved book, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She nodded solemnly.

‚ÄúTell you what,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take this to the craft table, and we‚Äôll see what we can do. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaya,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúOkay, Maya, let me work some magic. You stick around, and I‚Äôll bring it back to you in no time.‚Äù

Maya‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù she said, running off to tell her parents.

Returning to the table, I set the book aside carefully. Carla gave me a knowing look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a soft spot for kids, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I admitted with a smile. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just so‚Ä¶ honest. It‚Äôs refreshing.‚Äù

Mark leaned on the table, smirking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to think you‚Äôre part saint, Dani. Choir singer, intergalactic diplomat, fixer of childhood heartbreaks‚Ä¶ what can‚Äôt you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt whistle,‚Äù I shot back, making Carla burst out laughing.

‚ÄúSeriously though,‚Äù Carla said, recovering. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always helping everyone else. What about you? What do you actually want from all this alien exchange stuff?‚Äù

I hesitated, my usual confidence faltering for a moment. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe I just want to be part of something bigger. To feel like I‚Ä¶ matter in the grand scheme of things. Does that make sense?‚Äù

Carla‚Äôs teasing demeanor softened. ‚ÄúIt does. And you know what? You‚Äôve always mattered, Dani. To a lot of people. Don‚Äôt forget that.‚Äù

I smiled, the weight of Carla‚Äôs words settling warmly in my chest. ‚ÄúThanks, Carla. But don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to stop me from applying. Aliens or bust.‚Äù

‚ÄúAliens or bust,‚Äù Mark echoed with a grin, raising his lemonade cup in a mock toast. The three of us clinked our cups together, laughter ringing out as the swap meet continued around us.

Dim light filtered through the room as I opened my eyes, a sense of wrongness settling in. The blinds should have been open. My gaze flicked to the cradle, where the twins lay curled together, their tails intertwined. Then, the clock on my bedside table explained the darkness‚ÄîI still had nearly a quarter claw before my usual waking time.

My gaze landed on the photo beside the clock‚Äîa snapshot from the day my husband and I celebrated the news of my pregnancy. Joy and sorrow twisted together in my chest. I ran my fingers along the frame, the warmth of that moment at war with the cold reality of his absence. The empty space beside me had never felt so vast. The Arxur took him before Vissa and Tas were born. With too little time to sleep and no real desire to rise, I reached for my holopad to check Prime News. The anchor woman's voice cut through the silence, mid-sentence.

*‚Äú-minion forces have attacked the research outpost hosting the Venlil-Human Exchange Program. The station defenders repelled the arxur raiders with no damage to the station at all.‚Äù*

Despite her professional demeanor, no one could miss the satisfaction in her voice announcing the defeat of the arxur.¬†

*‚ÄúAccording to the Governor‚Äôs Office, no Venlil casualties have been reported.‚Äù*

That was shocking enough to drive the rest of the sleep from my mind. Such a thing couldn‚Äôt be possible. We always paid a heavy price for victory. ¬†

*‚ÄúHowever, the humans suffered over a hundred losses and recovery efforts are ongoing. One fighter, carrying both Venlil and human pilots, is missing in action. A source from the station claims this defender heroically lured two Arxur ships away before fleeing toward the Federation border. Their whereabouts and condition remain unknown.*¬†

*In a statement, Governor Tarva‚Äôs office emphasized that the lack of Venlil casualties was due to human copilots ordering their Venlil partners to eject‚Äîor, in some cases, forcibly ejecting them.‚Äù*

*Why would predators save prey? To them, we were food‚Äînothing more. I couldn't see how this fit into their schemes. What were they planning?* With a sigh, I set my holopad down and rubbed my snout. The twins would wake soon. Pushing myself out of bed, I approached the cradle. Vissa yawned and her blue eyes fluttered open.

I scooped her up, nuzzling her fuzzy head before cradling her in my arms. At the movement, Tas stirred, stretching with a wide yawn before blinking up at me. I chuckled softly and lifted him too, holding my babies close. Despite the unease the news had left me with, holding them steadied my nerves. I had to be strong for them. If the humans were scheming, I would do everything in my power to shield Vissa and Tas from the fallout.¬†

A soft chime announced that my quarter claw was up, and the blinds opened with the warm glow of morning light. It was time to start the paw. I checked their diapers‚Äîdry for now‚Äîbefore nursing them. The rest of the day passed in its familiar rhythm: playing, daycare drop-offs, work, pick-ups, more play, and finally curling up together for sleep. Things had settled into a comfortable routine again.

As I was playing with the twins in bed, my mind began to wander to current events. These last few weeks had been so hectic, the invasion sirens, Governor Tarva‚Äôs announcement about peaceful predators, and the closed borders. In a single day, we became prisoners in our own space. Our leader had cut us off from the Federation, leaving us defenseless. No allies. No protection. And yet, Tarva ignored the protests outside her mansion, even urging people to speak with the predators.¬†

The only sensible thing to happen was the magistrates announcing they would activate all of the current and former extermination officers and increase recruitment efforts to quell the growing unease. Still, the predators hadn‚Äôt done anything. They could have attacked the moment Tarva sent the Federation away but they didn‚Äôt.¬†

*Why?*¬†

My thoughts were interrupted by the ring of a call on my holopad, Mom and Dad‚Äôs photo flashing on the screen. Vissa and Tas watched curiously as I picked up the tablet and swiped to accept the call.¬†

‚ÄúHi honey, how are you?‚Äù

Dad stepped into the frame. ‚ÄúHow are the twins?‚Äù

I held the holopad over Vissa and Tas on the bed. The two seemed enraptured by the picture.

Dad cooed. ‚ÄúThey're so precious.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are doing better each day Dad.‚Äù I laid on the bed next to Vissa and Tas and held the holopad so that mom and dad could see me and the twins. Tas reached for holopad while Vissa giggled.

Mom spoiled them with attention, wiggling her fingers at the camera, encouraging Tas. ‚ÄúWe would love to come visit you and the kids. Oulo has a rest paw coming up soon. We should get their paw prints cast and take them to the park.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a great idea. I know the twins would love to see you. I still have some extra train rides on my account from my maternity leave. Message me the details and I‚Äôll book you both tickets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should save those dear, we can manage the tickets.‚Äù

I caught the worry in their tails, no matter how much they tried to hide it. ‚ÄúDad, I barely use the train in the Capitol‚Äîit‚Äôs cheaper to take the trolley, and with food prices so high, I‚Äôve had to stretch every credit. I have extra rides but they will expire if they aren‚Äôt used, and I‚Äôd love for you to visit. Besides, I could really use the help with the babies.‚Äù

That won them over and it wasn‚Äôt a lie. Living in the capitol meant we had more options for transportation. Plus, with the predators at their new complex, I haven‚Äôt been getting out except to get food or diapers.

‚ÄúOh, ok then. We wouldn‚Äôt want those to go to waste.‚Äù¬†

Dad nudged Mom with his tail. ‚ÄúTell her your good news.‚Äù

Mom, sat up and smoothed her fur excitedly. ‚ÄúI got the job at Vikki‚Äôs Flowers! You are looking at the newest florist trainee.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, that‚Äôs wonderful! When do you start?‚Äù

That was kind of a shock, with how bad things were, I didn‚Äôt think anyone would be hiring.¬†

‚ÄúI start in five paws. I was honestly surprised they were hiring at all with things how they are.‚Äù When Tarva closed the borders, she cut off all trade with the federation and caused an economic crisis like we hadn‚Äôt seen in my lifetime.

‚ÄúThat is wonderful news and I hate to cut this short but it is about time to put them down for their nap. Send me the details and I‚Äôll get you the tickets.‚Äù

‚ÄúRest well sweetie.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye Mom, Dad. See you soon.‚Äù

I ended the call and put the twins in their crib. Vissa was almost asleep already and Tas wasn‚Äôt far behind, despite his best efforts.",15,1737427385.0,NatureofPredators,6,1.0,False

2) Cold Brew - I appreciate the taste of a cold brew vs iced coffee and the subtle and no so subtle differences.  Will a Spinn produce a quality cold brew that you might make using another product or slow brew method in the fridge? 

3) Do you feel like all of the features/app/coffee taste outweigh the maintenance suggested by the manufacturer and potential cost of repairs, etc?

1i68g96,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1i68g96/automating_monthly_expense_tracking_in_excel/,Automating Monthly Expense Tracking in Excel,"Hi r/excel,

I've been maintaining a detailed monthly expense tracking sheet for the past two years and want to automate and streamline my workflow using Excel functions and formulas. Here's an overview of my process and the challenges I'm facing:

# (For reference there is a sample sheet as well as a picture attached).

# How My Sheet Works:

**1. Income and Expense Tracking:**

* Each month starts with the previous month‚Äôs closing balance as the opening balance.
* I manually log all bank transactions, including the date, description, and the amount before and after the transaction.
* Transactions are categorized into specific categories and subcategories (e.g., Housing > Rent, Food > Eating Out).

**2. Expense Classification:**

* I manually assign color-coded ""Status"" to each transaction after recording them:
   * **Green:**¬†Personal expenses.
   * **Blue:**¬†Split with friends.
   * **Black:**¬†Expenses done for a friend (not reimbursed).
   * **Gray:**¬†Non-essential transactions (e.g., credit card payments).

**3. Expense Allocation:**

* Each transaction is manually entered into the appropriate subcategory using the¬†`=`¬†function, after which I update the ""Status"" bar.
* Example: If I buy coffee, I input¬†`=T52`¬†in the Food > Eating Out subcategory.
* For split transactions, I adjust the formula accordingly (e.g.,¬†`=T52 + (T59/2)`).

**4. Splitting Expenses:**

* For equal splits, I use formulas like¬†`=B5/3`.
* For unequal splits, I manually calculate each person‚Äôs share in a separate sheet and enter the amounts manually.

**5. Expense Summary and Verification:**

* I review all entries and compare them with my bank statements.
* I check and recheck my data 2-3 times to ensure accuracy.

# What I Want to Automate:

* **Automatic expense categorization**¬†based on keywords in the transaction description or other methods.
* **Auto-assigning color codes**¬†after a transaction is plotted based on predefined criteria (e.g., green for rent, yellow for entertainment).
* **Simplified split calculations**¬†without manual input.
* **Ensuring all transactions are accounted for**¬†without manually reviewing each one.
* **Automatic ""Status"" bar updates**¬†to confirm successful plotting.
* **Tracking friends' shares separately,**¬†without needing to assign them status codes.
* **Reducing the need for multiple manual verifications.**

I have OCD, which makes me check my data repeatedly to ensure nothing is missed. I want an automated solution I can trust to help reduce this effort.

I've attached a sample of my sheet structure (all months follow the same format).

I'm looking for suggestions on Excel functions that work on Mac. I prefer not to use solutions involving Power Query or macros‚Äîjust traditional Excel functions. Thanks in advance for any advice!",1,1737427100.0,excel,2,1.0,False

I bought a Philips Series 2200 in late 2021 and ever since then I've always had one particular issue with the nozzle most likely and and I've had to get it repaired four times in total, three of these times under warranty and the fourth one in July 2024, not covered by it.

The issue is that when I make espresso, the machine starts grinding the coffee beans and then there are three possible outcomes: 

* Nothing comes out. When it happens I make a second espresso and it works, but other times it take more grinds and it's a waste of coffee beans. In July it just stopped no matter how many times I tried
* Coffee comes out but it's  literally dripping and takes ages to finish
* Normal flow, which is rare

Because of this inconsistency I don't know what to do. My parents want me to take it to get fixed once again but considering that I took it in July already and started having the same issue just five months later, I don't think it's worth, also considering the cost of it.

Do you think the problem is the nozzle? I watched a Youtube video where he fixed a leaking nozzle. Should I follow the same steps but then try to clean the tube that take the coffee to the nozzle?

","To give you guys some context, I (19M) met my current boyfriend (28M) one year and three months ago while I was living abroad in his home country for three months. When I came back, we started a long-distance relationship. Eight months ago (during long distance), he asked me to be his boyfriend. We started to discover everything about each other while being apart. We met twice because he came to visit me in my home country. I had some concerns about our relationship because of our age difference, and I experienced some anxiety and overthinking while being with him, but nothing overwhelming.

A month ago, I went to live abroad for another three months. During that time, I met his family, his friends, and got to know his everyday life. In my last week there, I asked to watch Netflix on his iPad while he wasn‚Äôt home. That‚Äôs when I saw websites in his history where he had been sexting other people. The website was for cruising and meeting men. It allowed users to watch porn, text, video chat, send pictures, and arrange discreet meetups. I read his chats, and they were explicit‚Äîhe asked for pictures and engaged in sexual conversations. He told me he never physically met anyone, and I believed him. We had previously discussed what we considered cheating, and I had been clear about my boundaries.

When I confronted him, he was upset. We talked about it multiple times, and I struggled with my emotions. We later had a therapy session, where I decided to break up with him. His reaction was, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre ending this over some texts.‚Äù At the time, I had nowhere else to stay, so he left his apartment, and I remained there. While staying there, I experienced intense sadness, missing him constantly, shaking, and crying. Two days later, I reached out to him and suggested meeting for coffee, considering the possibility of a second chance.

At the caf√©, we set boundaries. He told me he would quit porn, delete all his accounts on porn websites, and remove Snapchat (I‚Äôm unsure if he deleted Twitter as well). He said he had an unhealthy relationship with porn but was willing to change to rebuild our relationship. He reassured me that he would work to regain my trust.

After returning to my home country, I later found out that he was still watching pornography on a different website. This discovery led me to question whether anything would change. That night, I went to a small party and drank too much. A guy there was flirting with me, but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to him‚Äîjust as I had ignored others in similar situations.

At one point, I went to the bathroom, and two minutes later, someone knocked. Thinking it was my cousin, I opened the door, but it was the guy from the party. He grabbed my waist, and we started kissing. The thought of my boyfriend came while I was kissing him and pushed the guy away, telling him to leave. I became overwhelmed, started crying, and later threw up. The next day, I told my boyfriend what had happened.

He didn‚Äôt respond for a week. When we started talking again, I began experiencing panic attacks and heightened anxiety. He was angry, and two weeks later, he continues to avoid me, even though he says he wants us to move forward.

I‚Äôm not sure how to handle the situation. I‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed, and my anxiety is affecting my daily life.

I Met a Stranger Today



A Story by Daniel Melo

I met a stranger today, a nice young man at a coffee shop in my small town. Not a very large town in the heart of England but yet a well dressed man that would display his wealth. Accounted by his slicked hair and clean appearance wearing a three piece suit he would only bring me to think of someone I once knew. I don‚Äôt remember these frail days strolling these stone paths hoping I don‚Äôt get lost in the suffrage of my dementia. I sent my family away to America for a better and more wealthy life in the 1970‚Äôs but by the 1980‚Äôs they‚Äôve stopped sending letters. I only receive letters from someone I don‚Äôt remember but someone who yet I feel connected too. I still wonder in the waves my dementia progresses with. Though this young man reminds me of him, I just don‚Äôt know how. In the letters the writer would always explain their riches and how they‚Äôd love to share them with me. Though I‚Äôd love the riches, a chipper as he would only want something from me. I‚Äôve just never known what. In the scent of the coffee, tea, and pastries only the man stands out. I‚Äôve placed my order but I don‚Äôt remember what I ordered, a faint memory tells me the lady who took my order knew me. Oh yes, Maria was her name. A sweet little girl she‚Äôs always been. She comes from a nice family too, not a family of riches but of a good heart.¬†

The young man has come up to me, a nice long beige coat spanning down to his knees trailing behind him everywhere he stepped. The slicked hair and navy blue suit that completed his look. A lawyer I‚Äôd presume, I just don‚Äôt know why any of his vast looking wealth would be doing in a town like this.

‚ÄúMadam Carlile?‚Äù The man asked me with a soft voice,

‚ÄúOh yes, I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt remember you.‚Äù

I struggle to remember what he said but he explained from my memory of his trying to chase something, I just don‚Äôt remember what. I seem to have forgotten his name too. I feel ashamed of that.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve lived a life of joy and content but after I sent my family away I only felt alone. A big world and nobody to share it with. My husband passed long ago, too long to remember. I feel guilty of that. Oh how I feel guilty of many things. I‚Äôve lived a life of only guilt and sorrow.‚Äù I told the gentlemen as he sipped on his coffee.

‚ÄúI know how you feel, I‚Äôve wronged many people and myself in many ways of life. I‚Äôve turned my back against what was only there to help me and only found that out when it was gone. In life we can only move on. Letting these guilts trap us in their endless hold will keep us from our greatest potentials.‚Äù The gentlemen said with a heart of love, almost like he cared about me.

‚ÄúMy daughter was an amazing woman before I sent her to America, I only received letters from her, giving me a small glimpse of her life not so different from the one she left behind. It pains me to hear that from her. I haven‚Äôt heard from her in a while, I sure hope she sends another one of her letters inviting me to her findings.‚Äù I said as the young man began to tear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, have I said something that hurt you? I may have not noticed it in my dementia, my mind is uncontrollable these days.‚Äù I said, holding his arm as he wiped his tears.

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs just, well‚Ä¶ she must have been a nice woman.‚Äù He said.

I began humming to the vinyl records I keep at home of the piano symphonies from my grandson in America. The young man gave a brief smile,¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked to pour my life into a piano and let it dance along the sounds and rings like bells in a church. It brings peace and joy to me.‚Äù He told me with the returning smile, again the feeling of knowing him washed over me but unknowing why.

‚ÄúThe endless suns will shine high and die in their most beautiful exposure before I am enough with these days in this world.‚Äù I said looking out the window forgetting he was there.

‚ÄúLife will never be enough for any of us. No matter how many days we are given we just never feel ready to go.‚Äù He said quietly.

‚ÄúA friend once told me ‚ÄòŒñŒÆœÉŒµ œÑŒ∑ Œ∂œâŒÆ œÉœÑŒø Œ≠œÄŒ±Œ∫œÅŒø, Œ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒØ Œ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ∏Œ± œÜŒ≠œÅŒµŒπ Œ∫Œ¨Œ∏Œµ œåŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒø œÄœÅŒπŒΩ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄœÅŒøŒ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒøœÅŒπœÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ ŒºŒ±œÇ Œ∑ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±.

‚ÄúLive life to the fullest for it will never bring every dream before our destined day, we can only crowd so much into our lives before our frail bodies and handle no more.‚Äù He translated.

‚ÄúYou speak Greek?‚Äù I asked the man,

‚ÄúSome.‚Äù He replied with a soft voice as he looked at me.

I was given my meal from Maria and we continued our conversations. Even she could remember his name but it faded quickly from my mind.

‚ÄúMs. Carlile, you may not know much about me but I want to take you around your life as a final stroll. I know you may not remember me well if not at all but I want our final times to be memorable.‚Äù He said standing above me and reaching out for my hand.

I took his hand and we left the cafe and began walking through the street.

He‚Äôs such a kind young man. Always so patient with me. I don‚Äôt quite remember his name, though I feel like I should. But that doesn‚Äôt seem to bother him. He just smiles as he helps me down the street into his car. The ride is quiet at first, but not awkward. I glance out the window, watching the trees blur together, and a strange feeling wells up in me like I‚Äôve been here before, like I‚Äôve known him longer than I can remember. When we arrive at the park, my breath catches. It‚Äôs familiar in a way that fills me with warmth.

‚ÄúI know this place,‚Äù I say, more to myself than to him. The words come out slow, like I‚Äôm testing them.

He doesn‚Äôt say much, just nods and offers me his arm as we walk along the path. Then I see it, the old oak tree by the pond. My heart skips.

‚ÄúThat tree,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúI used to come here with my children. We‚Äôd spread a blanket right there under the shade‚Ä¶ and my little boy, he loved to climb it. Oh, he‚Äôd laugh so much.‚Äù

The memory feels sharp and vivid, like a sunbeam breaking through a cloud. For a moment, I can almost hear his laughter echoing in the breeze.

We sit down on a bench, and I can‚Äôt help but turn to the young man beside me. There‚Äôs something about him. Something familiar.

‚ÄúYou remind me of someone,‚Äù I tell him. ‚ÄúSomeone I used to know. He had kind eyes, just like yours.‚Äù

He smiles, but there‚Äôs something behind it. A weight I can‚Äôt quite place. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a coincidence,‚Äù he says softly. I laugh, shaking my head.

‚ÄúOr maybe I just see what I want to see these days. Either way, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù

The little antique shop is tucked away on a quiet street, the kind of place I could spend hours in when I was younger. I walk slowly, taking my time to touch the old books and faded trinkets. Then I see it, a silver locket resting in a glass case.

My breath hitches. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ this locket,‚Äù I whined, reaching out to point at it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just like the one Charles gave me for our anniversary. My Charles‚Ä¶‚Äù

The memories flood back, soft and sweet.

‚ÄúHe was such a romantic, you know. Did I ever tell you about the time he filled a whole room with roses? Just for me.‚Äù

The young man nods, his smile warm and understanding.

‚ÄúHe sounds like a wonderful man,‚Äù he says.

I look at him then, really look at him.

‚ÄúOh, he was. You would‚Äôve liked him. And you know what? I think he would‚Äôve liked you, too.‚Äù

The sun has set by the time we reach the square, the cobblestones glowing under the soft light of the streetlamps. Somewhere nearby, a musician is playing a saxophone, the melody drifting through the air like an old, familiar friend.

I stop in my tracks, listening. My heart aches not in a bad way, but in a way that reminds me of how full it has been.

‚ÄúCharles and I used to dance to music like this,‚Äù I say, looking up at the young man. ‚ÄúRight here, in this square. It feels like forever ago.‚Äù

He offers his hand, and I blink at him, surprised. ‚ÄúWould you like to dance?‚Äù he asks.

I laugh, shaking my head. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be silly. My old bones can‚Äôt handle that anymore.‚Äù

But he doesn‚Äôt take no for an answer. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do much. Just follow my lead,‚Äù he says, his voice soft and encouraging. And so I do. He holds me gently, guiding me as we sway to the music. It feels like a dream, like stepping into a memory I didn‚Äôt know I still had.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fine dancer,‚Äù I tell him with a smile. ‚ÄúHave I told you that?‚Äù‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù he says, and there‚Äôs a glint of something in his eye, something I can‚Äôt quite name.

For the first time in a long while, I feel light. Free. The aches in my body, the fog in my mind, all seem to fade into the rhythm of the music.

As the song ends, I thank him, my heart full.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve given me a wonderful day,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúIt feels like‚Ä¶ like I‚Äôve found pieces of myself again. You don‚Äôt know how much that means to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I do,‚Äù he replies, his voice quiet but sure.

We went to bed that night and he tucked me in, I don‚Äôt know why but it made me feel like a kid again. It was soothing for me. This seemingly stranger person treated me as if I were their own family.

I journeyed off to the cafe today and while I was there a nice young man walked in dressed luxuriously for a town as small as this‚Ä¶ Oh, I‚Äôve already written this. It seems my dementia has struck me again. Maria asked me about the young man whose name I still don‚Äôt know. She called home and had him come get me from the cafe.

We‚Äôve headed off in the car to a place I don‚Äôt know, but as we got closer I began to remember some of the things here, the structures. The trees, and my my, it was my home from childhood. We came to see the neighbourhood and the young man said I tried opening the front door and calling my mother but I don‚Äôt remember any of it. It just seems to be another moment of my dementia progressing. I don‚Äôt think I have long now, reading through these notes I‚Äôve written I‚Äôm still unknowing of this man‚Äôs name. I want to find out his name tonight. We journeyed through the neighbourhood as the children played. It reminded me of when I was here as a child. My mum calling me indoors for supper and making toys out of seemingly random objects.

‚ÄúDo you remember any of this?‚Äù The man asked,

‚ÄúI do, this was all my childhood.‚Äù I responded to him.

He then gave me an odd look, I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was about until I realised what was hours later, I had awoken in the hospital to the man speaking with a doctor. The doctor entered the room and began talking to me.

‚ÄúHello Madam, I am Doctor Morgan. Unfortunately yesterday you had an aneurysm in your thigh, we were able to repair the damages however it has caused some damages.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù The man asked when we walked into the room, still wearing the same clothes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely sorry to have to tell you this sir.‚Äù The Doctor said before my mind fogged, I couldn‚Äôt get any more.

‚ÄúReady for another adventure?‚Äù he asked, smiling in that way of his, the kind of smile that made you feel like everything was going to be okay.

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what the day would bring. That had become a familiar feeling lately, the uncertainty. It was like standing at the edge of a foggy road, unable to see more than a few meters ahead. But he made it easier somehow, like having a lantern to guide the way.

We drove in comfortable silence, the kind that didn‚Äôt need filling. I watched the world pass by outside the window, trees and houses blurring together, and felt a strange pull in my chest. It wasn‚Äôt sadness exactly, more like longing. A feeling that I‚Äôd been here before, though I couldn‚Äôt quite remember when.

Our first stop was a small art gallery tucked away on a quiet street. The halls were quiet and cool, the walls lined with paintings and photographs that seemed to whisper stories of other times, other lives. I found myself drawn to a painting of a garden, the colors so vivid they seemed to bloom off the canvas.

‚ÄúI know this,‚Äù I murmured, tilting my head as I studied the brushstrokes. ‚ÄúI used to have roses like these‚Ä¶ I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did,‚Äù he said softly, standing just behind me. ‚ÄúYou loved your garden.‚Äù

His certainty startled me. I turned to look at him, but he was focused on the painting, his expression unreadable. I let it go, though the thought lingered. It was nice, being with someone who seemed to know me so well, even when I didn‚Äôt.

Later, as we strolled through the town square, I felt a sudden urge to stop by the bakery on the corner. The scent of fresh bread wafted through the open door, warm and inviting, and before I knew it, I was heading inside.

‚ÄúI need to get bread,‚Äù I said over my shoulder. ‚ÄúCharles likes fresh bread with dinner.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt notice him catch up to me until his hand rested gently on my shoulder.

‚ÄúMadam,‚Äù he said softly, his voice steady but kind, ‚ÄúCharles isn‚Äôt here anymore.‚Äù

The words stopped me cold. For a moment, I didn‚Äôt understand. And then it hit me, the memory rushing back like a cold wind. The hospital. The quiet house. The empty space where he used to sit.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I whispered, my cheeks flushing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù he said, his hand still on my shoulder, grounding me. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep going. There‚Äôs more to see.‚Äù

By the time the sun set, the town had transformed. The main street was alive with music and laughter, tables lined up under strings of twinkling lights. The smell of grilled food filled the air, mingling with the sweetness of baked pies and the faint scent of flowers from the nearby stalls.

We found a table on the patio of a small caf√© overlooking the festivities. He ordered for both of us, and as we ate, I watched the people passing by. Children darting between tables, lovers swaying to the rhythm of a lively tune.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù I said, resting my chin in my hand. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of the town fairs we used to have when I was young. Everyone would come together like this‚Ä¶ It feels like a lifetime ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is beautiful,‚Äù he agreed, though there was something in his tone I couldn‚Äôt quite place.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet tonight,‚Äù I said, studying him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing important,‚Äù he replied quickly, though his eyes told a different story.

I let it go, my attention drawn to the band as they struck up a familiar melody. It was the kind of music that made you want to move, to hold someone close and sway under the stars.

‚ÄúI wish I could dance again,‚Äù I said wistfully, half to myself.

To my surprise, he stood and held out his hand.

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs dance,‚Äù he said simply.

I laughed, shaking my head. ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre determined to keep me young, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been young at heart,‚Äù he said, his smile warm and steady.

So I let him guide me to the edge of the square, where couples swirled and swayed under the fairy lights. He held me gently, his movements slow and careful, as if he knew how fragile I was. For a moment, I felt weightless, the years melting away with every step.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fine dancer,‚Äù I told him with a smile. ‚ÄúHave I told you that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù he said, his eyes glinting with something I couldn‚Äôt quite name.

The music slowed, the last note lingering in the air as we made our way back to the table. The day felt fuller, richer somehow, like we had squeezed an entire lifetime into those precious hours.

The drive home was quiet, the kind of quiet that wrapped around you like a soft blanket. I leaned my head against the window, watching the lights of the town fade into the distance.

‚ÄúIt was a good day,‚Äù I said softly, more to myself than to him.

‚ÄúIt was,‚Äù he replied, his voice steady, though I caught the faintest quiver in it.

When we got back to the house, he helped me up the steps and into my room. As I settled into bed, I looked up at him and smiled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good boy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to,‚Äù he said, brushing a strand of hair from my face.

I watched him as he turned off the light and closed the door behind him. The darkness settled around me, warm and comforting, and for the first time in a long while, I felt at peace. I didn‚Äôt know what tomorrow would bring, but for tonight, it was enough.

The morning came gently, sunlight filtering through the curtains and casting warm streaks across the walls. I could hear his voice before I saw him, low and steady, carrying through the thin walls of the house.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this is right, Don,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt even know who I am. Sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs cruel, taking her through all of this when she...‚Äù His voice trailed off, heavy with something I couldn‚Äôt quite place.

Don. That was who he was talking to. I wondered briefly who Don might be‚Äîan old friend? A confidant? Whoever it was, they seemed important to him.

I sat up slowly, my hands smoothing over the blanket as I tried to piece together where I was and who he might be. The fog in my mind was thicker than usual this morning, my thoughts like scattered papers caught in the wind.

He noticed I was awake and quickly ended his call, slipping the phone into his pocket.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he said, his smile warm but tinged with something that felt like worry.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I replied, studying him for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but... who are you again?‚Äù

The look in his eyes was brief but unmistakable‚Äîa flicker of pain, quickly masked by kindness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to keep you company,‚Äù he said softly, his voice steady as he pulled up a chair beside the bed. ‚ÄúHow did you sleep?‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was true. It was hard to tell these days.

As the hours passed, the fog refused to lift. I found myself asking the same questions over and over. What day was it? Where were we going? And each time, he answered with unshakable patience, his voice calm and gentle, as though he had all the time in the world.

The next day felt heavier, the air thick with something unspoken. He told me we would be meeting people from the town and some family that still lived nearby. Family. The word felt strange on my tongue, like it didn‚Äôt belong to me anymore. We spoke to people around town and they gave me a goodbye that I have never been given before. As if they knew something was going to happen. I did too.

The church bells rang out as we arrived, their deep, resonant chimes echoing through the small stone streets. The faces that greeted me were kind and familiar, though I couldn‚Äôt place their names. Some hugged me, others simply held my hand and smiled, their eyes full of something I didn‚Äôt quite understand.

He stayed close to me, his presence steady and reassuring as we sat together in the old wooden pews. The service was quiet and beautiful, the hymns stirring something deep inside me, though I couldn‚Äôt name it. I found myself reaching for his hand, and he held mine without hesitation, his grip firm and steady. When the service ended, we lingered outside the church, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets. The others talked and laughed, their voices blending into a comforting hum. I stayed close to him, the weight of the day pressing down on me like a heavy quilt.

As the evening drew near, we returned home, the house quiet and still. He helped me to my room, his movements careful and deliberate, as though I might shatter under the slightest pressure.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said as I settled into bed. ‚ÄúFor today. It was nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was,‚Äù he said, his voice soft but firm.

I looked up at him, my eyes searching his face. There was something familiar about him, something that felt like home, though I couldn‚Äôt place it.

‚ÄúYou remind me of someone,‚Äù I murmured, my voice trailing off as sleep began to pull me under.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù I said, my words slurring as my eyes drifted shut. ‚ÄúBut... you feel like family.‚Äù

As he shut the light and was about to close the door.

‚ÄúConner.‚Äù I said tearfully, ‚ÄúYour name is Conner. My Grandson.‚Äù

He fell into a pit of tears and came back into the room giving me a hug he has not given me yet.

‚ÄúYou are my Grandson.‚Äù I repeated with tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúYes, I am.‚Äù Conner said not letting go.

‚ÄúWhere are your parents?‚Äù I asked,

‚ÄúThey died, 7 years ago. I‚Äôm sorry for not coming sooner.‚Äù He said quietly,

‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt be dear, don‚Äôt be sorry. You are here now and that‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to wake up in the morning.‚Äù He said with sadness,

‚ÄúI know. But it‚Äôs okay, my time has come.‚Äù I said to him, running my fingers through his hair.

‚ÄúGoodbye, Grandma. Tell my parents I love them.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù I said as I slid back under the covers of my bed and Conner turned off the lights.¬†

This is a moment, no matter how strong or how far my dementia, I will not forget it.

‚ÄúGoodbye, Conner. Look up to the moon tonight.‚Äù I said as a final goodbye slipping into my sleep.



	Today is March 3rd of 1993, I went into my grandmother‚Äôs bedroom this morning and she did not wake. Her skin was cold to the touch. Goodbye Grandma. Days later we led her funeral, Don came to the funeral as well.

‚ÄúConner?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHi, Don.‚Äù I said,

‚ÄúYet another funeral.‚Äù

‚ÄúYet another,‚Äù I responded back.

‚ÄúToday we celebrate the next chapter of Carlile Cooper, she has moved on to the next chapter of her existence in the presence of God. God who has received another angel.‚Äù The funeral director said as he pulled out a bible. ‚ÄúRevelations 21:4, He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough funerals already.‚Äù Don said with a giggle.

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù I said back as we buried my grandmother tossing the dirt over the grave.

After finishing with the funeral ceremony Don returned to America. I still have a few things to settle here, before I return. I‚Äôm just not sure I can bring myself to do them.



I woke up to a shining light in my eyes and I lay on some floor. Awoken by 2 people. Finding myself in the endless grass I felt no more pain in my bones and my mind felt clear, I climbed to my feet better than I ever have before. I turned around and saw them.

‚ÄúOh my sweet Evelyn. Michael. Oh but Conner said you were dead?‚Äù I said to my daughter and son-in-law.

‚ÄúMom.‚Äù Evelyn said with her American accent.

‚ÄúOh, I see.‚Äù I said looking around and seeing the one fruit tree in the middle of the garden.¬†

TW SA,"I just had my first actual gay date, and I‚Äôm trying to process how it went. I‚Äôm 24, gay, and live in a rural community, so I don‚Äôt have much experience with dating outside of a few hookups in college. He‚Äôs the same age but had a 5-year relationship before this.

We met on Tinder and chatted on and off for a month, but he was pretty hot and cold. After he ditched plans a couple of times, I ended it, but the next day he messaged me on Facebook, apologized, and said he wanted to try seriously. I decided to give it a chance.

We planned a casual date: coffee, thrifting, and then hanging out at his place. When we met, it was awkward but not horrible. I was happy that I was able to be myself and not shutdown from the nerves. Then, he shared that he grew up nearby and had known who I was the whole time we had been talking, he knew my extended family, we had played sports against eachother as kids etc‚Ä¶ which was surprising because he never mentioned any of this before and I didn‚Äôt recognize him until he said it. Thrifting was okay‚Äîhe seemed introverted, and I tried to keep things light. At one point, I joked about a board game called ‚ÄúWet Heads,‚Äù and he replied, ‚ÄúIs that what you‚Äôre going to give me later?‚Äù which felt bold given how quiet he‚Äôd been.

Then we went back to his apartment, and things took a turn. I hadn‚Äôt smoked weed in years but agreed to try it because he smoked often. We went to his room, and he closed the door, turned off the lights, and put on Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. I took a couple of puffs, and then he asked about my coming out story. I gave him the short version and asked about his.

He shared that his parents cut him off after coming out, which was heartbreaking, and then he told me about some deeply traumatizing experiences involving SA. I panicked and said, ‚ÄúI would recommend therapy.‚Äù He laid down on his mattress and said, ‚ÄúTherapy?‚Äù in a tone that felt angry, I kind of got jumbled up and shared that it has been very helpful for me. Then he invited me to lay down with him, and at that point, everything hit me‚Äîthe weed, the dark room, the music, his trauma‚Äîand I felt completely overwhelmed. I made an excuse to leave and went home, where I ended up crying.

I later sent him a message explaining that I panicked and that I wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace to process everything. I told him I admire his bravery in sharing and that I hope he gets support to process everything. I also said I need time to think.

Now, I‚Äôm questioning myself. He‚Äôs obviously been through a lot and deserves kindness, but we didn‚Äôt exactly have chemistry and it felt like a big overshare for the first fate. I thought it was supposed to be more fun and lighthearted. Am I a bad person if I distance myself from him? Is this sort of experience common in gay dating?

Figured that I should just ask them on coffee/ice cream dates instead but eating good food is a pleasure of mine lol.

Perhaps that rule of etiquette would mainly apply IRL and is different when meeting others on dating apps? what are your thoughts? how do you go about this If you‚Äôre always the initiator? ",2,1737426149.0,AskLesbians,2,0.75,False

*trigger warning: binge-eating*

Hi everyone,

I am a volume eater and I graze too much in between meals. Historically I (33F) do not have a healthy relationship with food. I have been overweight all my life and have PCOS. Never limited myself in the carbs/sugar department until now.

I‚Äôve been at low carb about 1.5 weeks now and can honestly say I am really enjoying it - never once thought I‚Äôd say that about a diet! 

I‚Äôve had no cheat days, and proud to say I have been cooking at home a LOT more, challenging myself to plan and prepare new low carb recipes, and choosing to eat more whole foods than before. 

I‚Äôve only ordered Skip once last week (whereas before it was every other day..) and that was to order a chicken salad at work when I was really hungry and had no low carb snacks on me.

I have noticed no real difference on the scale or how I look, however.. trying not to be too discouraged and be patient as I know it takes time. Consistency is key with weight loss, as I‚Äôve been told.

This being said, I suspect I am eating too many calories.. I haven‚Äôt really been tracking anything, just focusing on eating low carb foods.

Things I‚Äôve been eating in rotation the last week:

- meat and eggs (chicken wings, bacon, sausage, ground beef)

- full fat dairy: cheese, heavy cream, no sugar coffee creamer, plain Greek yogurt, cream cheese, Premier Protein drinks

- veggies (Broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, dill pickles, romaine lettuce - Caesar salad, avocado/guacamole)

- fruit (berries)

- sweeteners (stevia, monk fruit)

- Orowheat wraps 

- sugar free versions of condiments (mustard, homemade buffalo sauce - Franks red hot & butter, ketchup, BBQ sauce, full fat ranch)

- nuts and oils (pecans, avocado oil, butter)

- snacks: Quest chips, no sugar chocolate chips, peanut butter cup fat bombs, sugar free vanilla pudding, Love Good Fats bars, Diet Pepsi 

My question is: What are your go-to low carb/keto recipes that are good for volume eating - where you can eat a lot of it, feel satiated for awhile, and not have to worry too much about calories?

I know I need to cut out the snacking/grazing in between meals if I want to see some better progress..

I am also thinking fasting would be a good idea .. I just really hate being hungry though. I find when I am hungry, I‚Äôm more likely to binge-eat and spiral, completely throwing out my progress. This is why I‚Äôd love some ideas of volume eater friendly recipes that I can have prior to going into a fast.

Any feedback or advice is welcomed and appreciated - Thank-you! ",1,1737425795.0,lowcarb,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm mildly (I think) LI. I can eat cheese without problem. Ice cream in small quantities. Milk, literally just a small sip or two for a taster is it, otherwise it‚Äôs thundergut central. If I combine any options (have Alfredo for dinner and then some ice cream) oh hell no. So I think some people have it worse since I can still eat *some*

But I‚Äôve always felt more on the ‚Äúbloated and sluggish‚Äù side of life. Never the lean, energized side. 

Can eating small quantities of dairy (like daily cheese, maybe daily yogurt, some real milk coffee creamer) make me feel a low level bloated without the traditional intense ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù lol

it usually happens like this. i meet new people (usually through a job or something of that nature. it‚Äôs happened in high school) and i really hit it off with them. we have tons of fun at work and laugh and joke around. we end up hanging out constantly, texting all the time, going to concerts, fun events, shopping ect. i‚Äôm always there for them if they need someone to cry to or vent. and vice versa, they are there for me and give me advice and support. i even sometimes will buy them coffees or lunch.(not too frequently just so i know i‚Äôm not being used) nothing will indicate they don‚Äôt like me, that there‚Äôs anything wrong. i‚Äôve even had these past ‚Äúfriends‚Äù write me paragraphs when i‚Äôm feeling down about how i‚Äôm a great friend and a great person and that i‚Äôm beautiful ect. then all of a sudden they slowly stop talking to me less and less and eventually ghosting or dropping me completely. sometimes this happens if someone gets a new job or something but other times it‚Äôs just out of nowhere. i‚Äôve even tried reaching out to them politely asking if there was anything i did wrong and even saying we don‚Äôt have to be friends, that i just wanna know what i did. but they‚Äôve always just left me on seen. 

i‚Äôm at the point where i think there‚Äôs something wrong with me and that i‚Äôm the problem. but then again i can‚Äôt think of anything i‚Äôve done wrong. i don‚Äôt gossip about them or spread rumors, i give them support and advice, i‚Äôm kind and caring. but no matter what, this just keeps happening. i‚Äôm at the point where i‚Äôm so depressed cause i just want even just one real friend.
