Script Link: [\[F4M\] A Morning with the Villain...](https://scriptbin.works/s/4ke6k)

Script: 

(Quiet humming)

\[SFX: Footsteps\]

\[Teasing\] Hey there hero, You're finally awake. Still tired from getting kidnapped...Days ago?

...

Sure, sure it's all my fault...You could leave if you want, no one is keeping you here...

...

(Laugh) I don't know either, Coffee? You look like you need it. Come on sit down.

...

\[SFX: Chair squeak\]

Ah, there you go. Good morning, dear.

...

Oh, am I smiling? I didn't notice.

...

(Gasp) What with this accusation? Maybe I'm smiling because the lovely face of the golden hero is in front of me. Not everyone can say that or even fathom having the pleasure to.

...

(Giggle) Uh oh, you got me... Should I tell you what I found out early this morning? It amused me greatly...still is even a few hours later. I don't know if you will feel too greatly about it- ...

Okay, I warned you. At around 3 I decided to take a little stroll to the Heroes convention building. I don't really like going there you know? It's dolled up in tons of gold, it's blinding, and doesn't fit their humble motto- but I digress. There are usually a few heroes in the lobby to greet anyone coming as you know but guess what? Silence. AH, It was exhilarating. No fake niceties.

...

Uh no, The building wasn't fully vacant...there was someone at the front desk. So of course I go up to her and ask her what's going on. Like where are the lobby heroes? \[Sarcastic\] The lobby will go up in flames if they're not in their spots. (Bright excited hum) She said they've been called onto the streets. Everyone's running around like they have no head on their shoulders.

...

Yeah, the other villains are out and about. Without the golden hero, they can actually get things done. I'm very happy for them.

...

\[Teasing\] Oh, I do have plans but my main one was to get you. (Smile) And as you can see I succeeded, are you proud of me?

...

\[Dramatic\] (Exaggerated Gasp) Are you telling me you didn't like staying with me? Cuddling with me?... All these secret moments we've spent t-together haven't meant anything to you? This closeness-

...

(Laugh) Oh whatever, you were buying it for a second there.

...

Yeah, I AM an amazing actress...at least better than the heroes.

...

Oh, that wasn't a dig at you and you know it. Stop messing with me. But speaking of my plans I would love to share them with you but I think they serve better as a surprise than as a normal conversation.

...

Yup, that is all you are going to get out of me dear hero. Now how's the coffee?

...

Horrible? Yup thought so. I'm not that good at making coffee, I always seem to burn it. Doesn't bother me though I don't like coffee anyway. I actually never buy it but I had a feeling you'd like some. I decided to try it making t again.

...

Yes, I did buy and try it just because I thought you wanted some. I've told you, you make me feel something I haven't in a while or if really ever. Not to get all cliché but as a Villain there is a small chance of finding someone that you click with, a person who doesn't judge you at first glance. Imagine being with someone that praises the people you hate...But then by a slight chance you do find someone, you have to worry about how they'd react to you being ""Evil"". ""Cause all Villains are evil"" they'd say.

...

(Amused laugh) I don't think I'm evil either, hero. But it doesn't matter what I think...the people, the citizens do.

...

\[Serious and curious\] Speaking of the citizens...It seems they haven't noticed you've been gone...I wonder why that is. I think I'll go out and see if I can find a little bit of information.

...

(Giggle) No, not right now. I'm thinking later tonight around 10-ish. Why? Are you worried you won't get to spend time with me all day? Or are You afraid I'll be swept away by my growing curiosity? ...

Hmmm, See your words and face aren't matching, my dear hero. You don't have to worry, I could never cut our time short.

\[SFX: Chair squeak\]

Ugh, this coffee is really not doing it for me. Dear, I tried for you but I think we both deserve something a little sweeter.

...

\[SFX: Slow Footsteps getting closer to Listener\]

I did pick up a few pastries when I went to get to buy the coffee. Would you like one?

...

Yeah, I'm going to eat one too. It's a little embarrassing but I'm sort of addicted to them. I got them from my all-time favourite bakery...

...

Why am I walking towards you? (Giggle) To give you a pastry, of course, I offered right?

...

\[Amused\] I don't have anything in my hands...You are right about that. How observant you are, hero.

|If you haven't already footsteps stop here|

\[Whisper\] I guess you could say I need something to go with my pastry (Giggle)

...

\[Dazed\] Can I kiss you?

...

Of course, I want to, I've been gone since 3 in the morning, and by the time I was actually here, you've been asleep. Not your fault of course but...I feel deprived of you.

...

\[Playful\] Don't you try to tease me, Pity your dear lovely Villain. The Villain you decided to give a chance to. The one you like so very very-

(Kiss)

Ugh, that coffee taste is so strong and nasty...but your sweet taste overshines it, hero. I'll have to thank you for that.

(Kiss)

Let me hold you for a bit.

\[SFX: Clothes rustling\]

(Contented sigh)\[Whisper\] I'm so glad they didn't corrupt you. I couldn't imagine my hero being like the others, so ugly and deceitful.

PAUSE

Though you'd be incredibly powerful. I know your leaders love to push you heroes, they want to see the power you unleash when you finally crack. I'd like to see you use your powers to the fullest strength, especially because I know that's the main reason they're in shambles. When other heroes went ""missing"" they've never done this. Just went about their day as if nothing happened. But you...you're definitely special. (Amused giggle)

QUICK PAUSE

...They're scared. Not knowing where you are...If a villain has got to you and maybe changed your mind...You're no longer in their grasp...I feel they're going to do anything to get you back hero.

PAUSE

Must feel amazing to be wanted this badly, hmm?

...

Good, I should be the only one that matters.

(Kiss)

I wished you'd join me as a Villain, we'd be unstoppable I know it.

...

I guess I would miss calling you my dear hero.(Laugh)

We’re trying to find a gift for my father in law. My FIL(70s) is a very simple man. He likes one or two types of beer, grocery store drip coffee, watching football, basketball (he wouldn’t wear a jersey or anything sports related) and the weather. He teaches dance lessons with my mother in law but that’s something she spearheads and he just goes along with it. He likes very simple foods (nothing spicy, just a meat and potatoes kinda guy) and simple clothes (think a button-up with jeans). He doesn’t go out of his way to listen to music, but likes classic rock. He pretty much just goes along with anything everyone else does. He has his own personality but seemingly little to no interests/hobbies. He loves dad jokes but doesn’t read books. He doesn’t cook much but likes to BBQ. He would have no use for weird specialized gadgets. He doesn’t like anything fancy that strays from the norm. I think the best gift to get him would be one of the very few food/drink items that he actually likes. My partner wants to get him something more fun and unique that he’ll actually enjoy but every idea I’ve had has been shot down because he thinks his dad won’t like it, use it, or it’s too simple. The $50 cap does limit us quite a bit. Any ideas? ",1,1731898195.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False

Maria is required to skip the bad betty fight (and get lots of coffee)  
Pearl is required to bribe some implings in the skull cave, and 2 fallen angels in the first Malus fight (no EXP)  
Umbra is required because she has camo, heal, and flap (which i stupidly didnt use)  
Anne is there because she's cool and has Tango (infinite EVD. anything over 100 makes you untouchable), (impossible to get before famine though)

I used lots and lots of lassos, and had to kill some members during certain fights to not get fraction amounts of EXP

If the EXP you get in a fight isnt divisible by the number of party members you have, then you'll get an extra 1-3 exp to round it out. This is bad for minimum EXP

You can bribe War. He's cool

You can't get over level 20 with 36k xp, and you cant keep all party members under level 13 either. The fact that Pearl is level 14 in my run is a shameful blunder of mine...... but eh",4,1731898194.0,ufo50,2,1.0,False

This morning we made 1 coffee and the grinder worked good and the 2nd coffee the grinder went flipflop. 

I removed the burrs, cleaned it out, all the of tricks the internet has about and it's not working.   
I'm adding a video with the sounds it's making - nothing live I've heard before, it sounds like the grinder isn't moving at all.

No one can really understand our relationship we are just 2 ppl trying to work it out any means we are very loving and affectionate but very untrusting and controlling relationship overall. I have an opportunity to run a business, take it over and make it my own pretty much. I’ve wanted to open my own coffee shop for a while it just seemed too far from reach (I don’t have a degree I tried but I was so busy and my mother had just died I wasn’t in a condition to focus also working 6 days to make ends meet) it costs so much to start from ground up and I think this would be an amazing opportunity because it’s already there. I’ve been considering it because I know that it’s a lot of hard work and hard hours i just want to make sure i get what I put in $ at the minimum. I love where I work there are many regulars who like me and support the small business as well (there’s only 4 workers and the owner that’s why I say small but it makes maybe $4,000 a day from 6-5pm but anyway.  I told him I’m seriously considering it and he just tells me how hard it is and kinda said sarcastically “it’s definitely an opportunity, if you think you can do it” and then proceed to tell me everything that would make it so difficult. This isn’t the first time either I have a few other hobbies welding and mechanics, I personally think trade should would be best for me because it’s hands on that’s the only way that I learn but everything I suggested he he’d just shut me down and tell me you don’t want to do this and this listing off small aspects of the job that yes would be annoying but not a dealbreaker. Now I get it he would probably say it’s because I love you and I want you to see what you’re getting into but it feels like shutting me down. It sucks because I’ve been nothing but supportive. All thru his college degree he graduates in may and before he had a good job and I still support him trying to find a better one I’ve done nothing but tell him he can do it and I believe in him. He tells me I should do something with my life because once your older it all goes away (I want to be a sahm and he’s supportive of that) but that’s so reasonable so why won’t he support any decision I want to make to actually better myself and tbh my resume. Even if I bail out of that business in a years time I have more opportunities with that experience. I want to know that I am set and that I can make money being a manager or something. I make pretty well for my state anyway because my boss knows I do a good job (we agreed on the price before I even filled out my application he poached m from my other job lol) so I can definitely support myself but I’d like to have that security:/ ",1,1731897917.0,Truthoffmychest,0,1.0,False

So I clocked the crappy boyfriend (was SO glad to see she nicked a bunch of his fancy pretentious coffee stuff when she left), the mobility issues and stopping rock climbing, the things she kept even when they got worn out (stuffed animals, the cup for toothbrushes) but on thing I haven't seen anyone comment on is her career, specifically author/artist of kids' books.  

  
We see her do a lot of drawing and enjoy a lot of stories (games/books) and she has childish drawings up when she's presumably post college, which struck me as odd, but makes sense in context. Her art supplies expand, become digital, etc. Then in the final year, her office includes a tonne of copies of a (presumably kids') book. I got a tad emotional thinking that this meant she'd published a children's book, culmination of all that development, and ties into the awards (and even more drawing/writing stuff) in that office. Can't think of a more likely reason for having so many copies.

  
So, is this an obvious thing I just haven't seen anyone mention, did everyone else have a different interpretation, or did my game glitch and the books weren't supposed to be the same (maybe they're not even books at all...)?",1,1731897867.0,Unpacking,1,1.0,False

""Because you never have to do that. You don't have to get Shepherd coffee or fix Callie's baby schedule or... relax me. You're too good of a doctor for that. And when you look back in 10 years, you'll be relieved you didn't.""

Considering Cristina's own history of sleeping with mentors would you interpret that as meaning she felt she had to sleep with them to earn favours and she really regrets it now looking back? Or is she saying something else?

I think Cristina definitely loved Burke because even though she wouldn't want to start things up again she's not over him even seven years later - it seems that way when she sees him again in season 10 so I couldn't say she was only ever with Burke for favours. But I could buy it with Marlowe because there didn't seem to be any love lost on Cristina's end when he showed up at the hospital, I believe she was attracted to his talent but didn't love him. Or maybe she's really talking about the boss in Mayo, maybe she slept with him because she thought he'd stop giving her a hard time about being sad at work if she did. 

Even if it's true that on some occasions Cristina slept around to get ahead I can respect that she doesn't want the cycle to continue and would have been unhappy if Shane had slept with her just because he thought he had to in order to succeed. 

Thoughts? Am I overthinking it? It struck me as a very good bit of dialogue.

1.2 - The max random bonus multiplier given when attacking (random # from 1.0 to 1.2)  
7 - The max damage multiplier given with a shotgun

Pearl's base attack and choice of shotgun are nearly inconsequential; as well as Anne doing ChaChas, only adding about 5k damage to the total.

  
Why a 7 multiplier? Shotguns work by placing four squares on all corners of the enemy's center. A bullet is placed in a random spot on each square, and each bullet that touches the enemy's hitbox deals damage (making colossal enemies easy to hit)

each of the 4 pellets do a random damage number from 0 to 1.5x the main shots damage (so if you miss they'll all do 1 damage).

that means on average the 4 pellets, plus the main shot, deal an average of 4x the base shots damage, and up to a maximum of 7x its damage.

So on average this setup will deal 897k damage. With a little luck you'll get a million

Also this takes 1700 turns to set up, as you need to perform 1700 howls.",3,1731897596.0,ufo50,0,1.0,False
1gtuo26,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1gtuo26/my_love_of_riding_is_back_thankyou_all/,My love of riding is back! Thankyou all!,"Group appreciation post. 
About a year ago, I came off my Rebel 500 after a near miss with a car. Once I got my bike back from repairs (minor damage only, nil significant injuries) I was terrified to ride it. I posted in this group asking how I can get my mojo back and the advice was simple and clear: 'get back on the horse that threw you', so I did, to and from work on fair weather days. My anxiety was through the roof the whole time. Today, for some reason, I put my packtalk edge into a new helmet and a little voice said 'go for a ride'. I ended up going to my favourite coffee shop and back home again. The whole time I was calm, relaxed and happy. Had some lo-fi tunes for company and felt my bike slide around corners and pick up on straights like she was meant to. My body just went with the flow and it felt amazing to cruise around again
Thankyou for your advice guys!

We just got home and I just want to say we really enjoyed our short time there.

We left our house around 2:30pm and made out first stop at Point Pleasent around 4:30 and went to the mothman museum. I of course dont ""believe"" in the mothman but as a lover of history I really enjoyed seeing all the newspaper and relics from the time and reading how people thought of the situation at the time. Also stopped in some shops along the street there and got some pokemon cards I needed from the comic shop right down the road. I also LOVED the murals painted on the walls along the river.

  
About an hour later got to charelston and ate at the Cold Spot which as a wing lover the people in the Charelston Subreddit (which I imagine many of you are apart of) told me was the best in town. They were fantastic wings and we got there in time to have it packed with WVU fans cheering for there team (felt a little strange wearing my OSU hoodie haha) I must say they had the best onion rings me and my fiance have ever had, while the wings were great id say the onion rings were even better. Checked into our Hotel the sheraton which was great but then soon we went to Taylor Books where I had a really good cappucino and we listened to some of the live music. Eventually we made our way down to Sams Uptown Cafe and had a few drinks and hopped over to the blue parraot which we loved. We love dive bars and it was probably one of the diviest we have ever been in but the people there were so nice I got hit with ""Based off your accent and hoodie you aint from here? well its good to have ya here, hopefully you can see we arent the uneducated inbreds like people from Alabama"" (real interaction) and I loved it. The live bluegrass music really set the vibe for us and we ended up having around 10 beers between the two of us haha.

Next morning we got up early and went to Tudors biscuits as since the Marshall HC talked about giving players NIL deals for unlimited Tudors I knew I had to try it and fittingly got the Thundering Herd Biscuit. Made the drive to New River Gorge and hiked up the Long Point Trail and got some amazing photos as the fog had cleared at the time. We then got coffee at the cathedral cafe in town and walked around before heading back to Charelston to explore the Capitol Building as it hadnt opened until 12 today so we did new river first. Gorgeous building inside and out, unfortunately since it was sunday the Museum was closed but now I just have a reason to comeback. And on the way back to Columbus we stopped at the bucket and had more great food (I will say I think Cold Spot has a small edge on Bucket in terms of wings). And now im home typing this.

Seriosuly had an amazing time in a new state and have been so curious about Apalachia since I started playing Fallout 76 in 2018 and watching multiple videos about the area. The drive was gorgeous especially to new river, I will say it was a little sad in some spots to see them so rundown or abandoned but I sort of expected some parts of that and it just made me hope even more that the state can some how in some way continue to prosper. It was also nice seeing some mountains and hills again after being away from Arizona and in the flat land of Ohio. Next time I want to go Blackwater Falls and maybe even see a WVU game.",13,1731897435.0,WestVirginia,3,1.0,False

We crossed paths a few times in the store, and I thought she was really cute.

I lost track of her in the aisles. Luckily, we ended up parking next to each other!

I finally worked up the courage to say hello, We chatted for a bit and decided to

go on a date over the weekend. I'm currently going through a divorce,

which I explained to her upfront on our date. We talked for over two hours –

it was supposed to be a quick coffee, but we really hit it off! We

had a second date planned, but it got postponed twice due to her work commitments.

Both times we met, we went for a nice long walk talking about many things and she held my hand.

She made me feel really good, and she said she felt the same way.

I was respectful and never did anything to make her uncomfortable.

However, after the second date, she started responding to my texts

with short answers and sometimes even ghosting me. After waiting pateintly for close to two weeks ,

I asked her directly if she wanted to continue dating, and she simply said ""no.""

I told her I had a great time and said goodbye.

I'm confused because she seemed so into me at all the time. She even mentioned multiple

times how much she liked me and my behavior, especially since she had a pretty abusive

past relationship. I'm puzzled by the sudden shift/change. .

I am coming from a toxic relationship (hence divorce).

I did not question her say anything bad which is not my style.

But I was hurt and felt really bad for about a week because

I liked her and wanted to pursue dating to see if she is the one.

I am not desperate at all and did not behave lie one. She could have

simply rejected me but why spending quality time and then telling she liked

me and the ghosting me. Did I do something wrong",1,1731897350.0,dating,1,1.0,False
1gtul3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gtul3o/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don't know what to do,"I'm not going to disclose my age, but I'm in high school. I'll be graduating soon, that's all I feel comfortable sharing.

This morning my dad woke me up by shouting at me to get out of bed. I think he had tried to get me up once before that, but he knows I have trouble waking up because unless someone is making sure I open my eyes, my mind will not register that I'm supposed to be awake. I can get up to my alarm though.

Anyways, he yelled at me, and that was the first thing I woke up to. I said I was sorry even though I didn't know what I did wrong, and he just said ""thank you"" and then as I went to close my door to get dressed for church he started lecturing me about how I'm addicted to my devices and I can't get up because I'm always awake past midnight, which is not true, and he knows that's not true. I can't remember the last time I stayed up past midnight, I am very good at getting myself up and putting myself to bed when I need to. I set my alarm every night so I am up in time for school, and I put my phone away by myself at a good time to make sure I get 9 hours of sleep every night. He said that I was up late last night, on my phone and that's why I was having trouble getting up, but he KNOWS that's not true, but he started like gaslighting me into thinking it isn't true. I know he knows it's not true because he came home at like eleven last night, and I was in my mom's bed, snuggling with her, and I was half asleep, and he came in the room and told me it was time for me to go to my own bed, so I got up, and stumbled to my own bed, and turned the lights off and fell asleep. I heard him telling my brother to put his tablet away while I was doing this, and this morning he said that my brother never stays up late with his devices, but I do, which is so obviously not true to everyone around me that it's actually frustrating that he's just pretending that it's true.

When he was lecturing me this morning he was telling me about how my brother and I were going to get our devices confiscated at night because I can't get up, which, again, is not true, and he said ""now you're brother is getting punished because of you"". When I tried to defend myself he said I was playing the victim and deflecting, which is actually so funny because that's all he ever does.

He also started lecturing me about how he asks me to do the dishes everyday (which he actually doesn't, he just leaves the dish washer open in hopes that I'll get the hint, but if I don't get the hint he'll get mad. It didn't really take me long to figure that out, and I try to get to the dishes) he said that I never do it and he always have to come home from work (at four o'clock by the way) and do the dishes. I don't get to stop doing school until seven because I have so much studying to do. I'm trying to get into college, I'm taking so many hard classes, and he gets mad if I don't get good grades, so I'm trying to please him with that, but I cannot do it all. I told him that I'm studying all day and doing school all day long, and he said that everyday when he comes home he always sees me watching tv on my laptop, which is not true. Maybe he hears sound coming from my laptop, but that's not tv, it's probably either a video one of my teachers recorded to further explain instructions, a video I looked up to help me with a math problem I didn't understand, or music because sometimes music helps me study, but I know he doesn't hear my show on my laptop because it isn't on, but he won't let me defend myself because he's the father, and I'm not allowed to speak (i sincerely wish I was kidding). I would do the dishes, but I often don't have time, and I guess I could probably do it while watching a video assigned by a teacher, or while in a class, but I'm usually taking notes, and even when I'm not, I forget about the dishes because I'm so damn busy! Hell, I forget about everything because my brain is so consumed by school, I forgot that I was supposed to get coffee with my friends after church today and completely missed it. I'm not usually someone who forgets things unless I'm so busy. I can barely go to all the church events my dad makes me go to because I can't get a break from school, I just have to work for a little longer the next day on days that I have church events because my dad does not like it when I miss those. 

After he yelled at me I started crying, but I didn't let him see it because then he would go on about how now I've made him feel like the bad guy.

I can't tell anyone in my life about this because he's friends with everyone. He presents himself as the father of the year, and I'm scare of what will happen if I tell anyone. He doesn't hit me anymore, he used to spank me, and then he used to touch my ass randomly because he thought it was ""cute"" I had to ask him to stop a few times for him to actually stop, but he was mad that I asked him to stop because it hurt his feelings. I don't like being touched there because number one, it's fucking weird and it feels violating, and two I've been touched before, and experience child on child sexual assault so I hate being touched anywhere from hips to knees by anyone. It makes me want to cry, and start freaking out, I really don't like it.

Like I was saying, he doesn't get physical, but I'm scared of him because he's still so unpredictable. He's sometimes so mean to me, and then he's so nice, and I get so confused, and I don't know who to tell because I don't think anyone would believe me or care. I also feel like he expects everything from me, and he doesn't even ask my brother to clean up after himself, he asks me to do that.

Another thing is that I'm scared because at my church there is this guy who used to groom me, and now he just stares, and hangs around, and acts like he's coming towards me, and then goes to talk to someone else, and it scares me so much. I'm so scared of what he's going to do to me, but I could never leave that church because he likes to introduce himself to parents who have little girls, and I always feel like I need to tell the parents to watch out.

Anyways, I'm just scared of men right now, and I needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.",1,1731897320.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False

 Write a story inspired by these lyrics:

# ""Behind the Gate""

The car rattled over the loose gravel as Marcus drove up the narrow driveway to his father’s house. The sun was setting behind the old oak trees, casting long shadows across the land. The place felt smaller than he remembered, like time had tightened its grip, squeezing the life out of everything. He parked the car and sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, trying to steady himself.

“Time to face the music,” he muttered under his breath.

Inside, his father, James, sat at the kitchen table, sipping coffee from an old chipped mug. The walls were still adorned with photos from another lifetime—Marcus as a kid, his mom before she passed, fishing trips and holidays that felt like ancient history.

James looked up as the door creaked open. His face was lined with the kind of weariness that comes from years of disappointment. “You’re late,” he said flatly.

Marcus sighed and dropped his bag on the floor. “I’m here, aren’t I?”

“Barely.” James set the mug down with a thud. “What’d you mess up this time?”

Marcus hesitated, then shrugged. “Same story, different chapter. Tried to flip some cash on a deal. Didn’t pan out.”

James shook his head, a mixture of anger and pity in his eyes. “You’re just like your mother. Dream big, fall harder.”

“Don’t,” Marcus snapped, his voice rising. “Don’t bring her into this.”

Silence hung between them like a thick fog. Marcus sat across from his father, their eyes locking in a battle neither of them wanted to fight.

“You’re not going anywhere with that attitude,” James finally said, his tone low but firm. “And you sure as hell aren’t going anywhere until you pay back what you owe.”

Marcus laughed bitterly. “I’m not asking for your help. I’m just here to figure things out.”

“Oh, you’ve got it all figured out?” James leaned back, crossing his arms. “You’ve been chasing the same pipe dreams for years, son. You need to stop digging holes you can’t climb out of.”

“I know,” Marcus said, quieter this time. “I’m just… trying to find my way. Feels like there’s a hole in my head, like I’m missing something.”

James studied him for a moment, the anger in his expression softening. “You think I didn’t screw up too? You think I didn’t have to learn the hard way?”

Marcus looked away, his jaw tight. He didn’t want to hear this, didn’t want the weight of his father’s wisdom crushing him further. But something about the man’s voice made him stay.

“I lost plenty,” James continued. “But you’ve got to stop running. Stop trying to hustle your way out of every mistake. Sometimes, you just have to sit with it, face it head-on.”

Marcus nodded slowly, the words sinking in deeper than he wanted to admit. He thought about the deals gone wrong, the bridges burned, the nights spent staring at the ceiling, wondering if this was all there was.

“I’m not asking you to fix it for me,” he said finally. “I just need a place to think. To figure out who I am.”

James nodded. “You can stay. But you’re gonna work. No shortcuts, no excuses.”

Marcus smirked faintly. “Fine. But I’m keeping my bag.”

“Keep the bag. Just don’t expect me to carry it for you.”

As the night settled over the house, Marcus stepped outside. The air was crisp, the sky clear and full of stars. He stared at the gate at the end of the driveway, the metal glinting in the moonlight. It felt like more than just a barrier—it was a symbol, a challenge.

“I’ll get behind it someday,” he murmured to himself.

But for now, he stood on the outside, grappling with the weight of his mistakes and the hope that maybe, just maybe, he could find his way through.",0,1731897319.0,bladee,0,0.5,False

So a bit of background, we've been together 4 years, I'm a First Nations women who runs a buisness teaching people how not to be racist and he works full time stacking shelves at night. 

We tried for two years and had a miscarriage during this time as well, the plan was I'd stay at home with bub due to running a buisness from home, he would return to work and on his days off he'd help out with taking care of our daughter and helping around the house.  The first week he returned to work, it was great. He'd get up in the morning feed her, take her on walks, helped around the house, there were no issues.

After that first week he stopped doing those things, when our daughter started crying for her bottle and I woke him up to do it (as he said the night before he wanted to do it) he would wake up I then said ""come on daddy, give me a bot bot so mum can have a coffee"" and he said ""go away, this is what you wanted"", so i did it. I brought it up to him later in the day and he said he had never said it and I had misheard, when I was adamant that he had said it he told me I was being manipulative (this is a general cop out my family uses, my brother told me to go kill myself, then said he never said it and I was just manipulating him into feeling bad) so my partner knew this would upset me.
I've noticed in the two weeks since, he's done fuck all. I've had to take on more work to build a safety net due to housing insecurity, so im working 50 hours a week in my buisness, then taking care of my daughter and the house. He works 65 hours a fortnight. This weekend he had the whole weekend off and he did one feed. I did all the house work, feeds, was up til 2am working then up again at 9am for bottle time. I hurt my shoulder and was struggling to hold our daughter and he said ""are you alright"" ""no my shoulder is killing"" ""oh maybe you pinched something"" and went out for a smoke, he offered to finish the bottle when he came back in but at that point it was nearly finished. 
Honestly it just pissed me off, it feels like he thinks because I wanted to stay at home than trying to afford child care that he doesn't need to do anything to help out. Then to top off my shitty mood the topic of engagement came up (I've been bringing it up a bit for the last year or two, he doesn't feel the need to get engaged so hasn't bothered with it), I said that if we get married we should hyphenate our last names so we have the same last name as our daughter, to represent the joining of two families, but he said no. He doesn't want to change his last name to be a combination of both because it's ""weird"" and ""other men with judge me"", even when I told him he doesn't need to even tell anyone that's what we've done, it was still a no. He knows that due to my culture and family, I wouldn't take his last name completely but would be happy to hyphenate out of respect for him and his family, but he doesn't want to show that same respect in return. 
This isn't what I wanted, I didn't want to feeling like I'm a single mother taking care of two kids because he can't even do the bare minimum while im in physical pain. I don't know what to do, when I tried to talk to him he got upset at me claiming that I'm only working because I dont trust him to take care of us financially when I know he would, its about me not giving up something I've worked so hard for. I thought we were doing it together, not me doing 90% of everything. I'm also at the point were if he does propose, I dont know if I should say yes.. what should I do? 

Tldr my partner told me I wanted to be a working stay at home mum, yes I did but I didn't realise that meant he wouldn't be doing anything to contribute to child care/house work and I dont know what to do.",1,1731896611.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Met a girl in 2017 we dated a littler get to know each other phase 
Well Few months later said girl moved in with me as we became more  romantically involved 
Said girl lived with her parents etc 
Well this girl tended to spend a lot of time with her step dad .. 
mostly getting coffee or scraping or dumping trash because he was to cheap to buy the bags at the time 
Anyways I was bored and wanted coffee myself so I went to the place they were suppose to be at well they were not there I texted her and she said she was I was like ok just played it off for the time being
Later on I was having an off feeling so yes I did track her location … well found out she had been lying they would go to some off the beaten path road and then chill there for a good 10-20 minutes before getting coffee and coming home anyways I played it off and asked her I saw you pass me around so and so no we’re near the coffee place she got defensive and was like why does it matter I was hanging with my step dad blah blah blah 

Well after a year passes just off feelings one after another with no proof of anything jealously or something who knows 

Well we got a house that was directly on the side of her parents apartment the years was shared so that close … anyways notice her step dad trying to always be around and glancing at her booty etc 

I’m like alright I ask her about she said it’s all in my head and if I continue to be like this she will leave me 

Ok another couple years go by she’s pregnant etc
Then her and the step dad stop hanging out cold turkey he became distant didn’t even go home to her mom etc at a reasonable time not like he had a job or anything no income technically except for metal on the side of the road anyways 
Time passed our kid now is 4 months old and she tells me to read a message her aunt sent her I’m like ok 

And her aunts message states she sorry she left the situation her uncle would have ended up in jail because her step dad raped her at a young age … 
So I immediately questioned her about this and she confirmed it was true and that she been having relations the whole time … so for 30 years or so but pretty much our whole relationship 

Anyways a lot happens from here everything comes out in the open and her moms kicks the step dad out claiming she didn’t know but then said mother takes off out of state and no contact so my gf has no family and the sicko is out her life etc it’s been some years since then ended up having another kid .. things have been alright I guess I’m more or less going through the motions but I’m withdrawn 

Anyways not sure if I should stay or not but she got pregnant recently and the date the ob said she got pregnant in I haven’t done anything with her period so I don’t think it’s mine I’ll get a paternity test anyways I’m stuck I’m miserable mostly staying because of the kids 

She has mental illness bipolar 2 and dcf on her twice for neglect and physical and verbal abuse etc 
Our oldest is autistic I don’t want to leave the kids with her and I doubt I would win custody as were I live mothers usually win no matter what  seriously

Some TV shows I have seen have people doing ""coffee runs"" where someone goes out and buys takeout coffee for their coworkers and brings it back to the workplace. 

Additionally, the most common advice from Americans on how to save money seems to be to stop buying coffee every day. 

Do workplaces in America not provide free coffee? Do people not have coffee makers at home?

Basically everyone where I live has a drip coffee maker or moka pot or some kind of coffee making device which they use to make coffee at home every morning and then they go to work and drink the free coffee there for the rest of the day.

Personally I drink around 4 cups a day but I only buy coffee from a coffee shop maybe twice a month even though I walk past coffee shops on my way to work each day. For most people I know, going to a coffee shop is more of a special occasion type thing for meeting someone or just treating yourself. It seems kinda crazy to me to do it several times a week.

Are Americans really buying so much takeout coffee that it's a financial burden and a pit stop to work every day?",6,1731896357.0,NoStupidQuestions,32,0.75,False

I’m a huge fan of the show and actually made a throw away to post this, I could really use your input and appreciate any advice or honesty people have to give!

Fake names for obvious reasons. Also I’m so sorry how long this got :( 

I (18f) went to a club last weekend with a group of friends one of which included Jimmy (19m). Jimmy was talking with me before we went in about what classes I was taking next semester. I told him I hadn’t done my registration yet but would try to this week. Jimmy told me I should join a certain class because Ben (19m) would be in it and I could try to ask him out.

For context, a couple months earlier, Ben (a friend of Jimmy’s) had hit on me a couple times and I rejected him but eventually I asked if he wanted to grab coffee which he agreed to. However, we cancelled and never ended up rescheduling. Right after this I started talking to Anthony (18m) and I have really started to like him. So when Jimmy suggested this, I told him I’d check out the class but I wasn’t interested in Ben since Anthony and I are talking so much. Jimmy kept pressing and asking “even if Ben asked you out you would say no?” and I kept replying “I’m really not interested in Ben so I’m not going out with him.”

We get in the club and Jimmy is clearly in a bad mood being tense to our friends and just acting weird. At one point, Jimmy looks at me and asks “If you and Ben were in the same class together do you think you would have a hard time being professional with him?” This catches me off guard and I ask why that would be an issue. Jimmy goes on to tell me since I had a “thing” with Ben it may be difficult for me to work closely with him without getting emotional. This gets me really pissed and I keep reiterating I’m not into Ben and my personal and school/work life are two separate things entirely. I told him if anyone made it unprofessional it sure as hell wouldn’t be me not to mention I am already interested in someone else.

On top of all this, the field I’m studying is male dominated making this comment more offensive to me because I don’t think Jimmy would ask that kind of question to a guy. I would’ve said more to Jimmy in the moment had we not been in such a busy space (especially considering he was interested in a classmate but it didn’t work out) but I think going back and trying to retroactively talk with him may make things worse. I’m also very bad when it comes to confrontation and tend to bottle things up best I can. I feel like I may be overreacting about the whole thing since I doubt he meant it to come across that way but I’m really bothered. My friends all sided with me but I want outside opinions.

Until this year, I'd been sticking to traditional methods (like brooms and mops) , during the recent prime day, I finally bought the first robot vacuum. It was actually a combo set: a robot vacuum cleaner, a handheld vacuum, and a mop pad. I thought the design was quite practical and the discount was great (it seems like it's now just over 300 dollars). 

I left it unboxed for a long time until yesterday, when my son's birthday arrived and he invited a bunch of kids over for a party. After the party, I was nearly overwhelmed by the mess: crumbs from cookies and chips scattered everywhere, tomato ketchup stains on the floor, and dog hair brought in by some of the kids. That's when I remembered to unpack the Yeedi c12 combo. I really want to recommend it to you cuz I found it so much more convenient than traditional cleaning methods. I let the robot vacuum cleaner handle the light dusting on the floor, while I used the handheld vacuum with different attachments to clean the gaps between the sofa cushions and the coffee table. After the robot finished its job, I attached the mop pad to the handheld vacuum and did both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. The whole routine took me less than 20 minutes, which would have taken at least an hour before.

So a bit of background, we've been together 4 years, I'm a First Nations women who runs a buisness teaching people how not to be racist and he works full time stacking shelves at night. 

We tried for two years and had a miscarriage during this time as well, the plan was I'd stay at home with bub due to running a buisness from home, he would return to work and on his days off he'd help out with taking care of our daughter and helping around the house.  The first week he returned to work, it was great. He'd get up in the morning feed her, take her on walks, helped around the house, there were no issues.

After that first week he stopped doing those things, when our daughter started crying for her bottle and I woke him up to do it (as he said the night before he wanted to do it) he would wake up I then said ""come on daddy, give me a bot bot so mum can have a coffee"" and he said ""go away, this is what you wanted"", so i did it. I brought it up to him later in the day and he said he had never said it and I had misheard, when I was adamant that he had said it he told me I was being manipulative (this is a general cop out my family uses, my brother told me to go kill myself, then said he never said it and I was just manipulating him into feeling bad) so my partner knew this would upset me.
I've noticed in the two weeks since, he's done fuck all. I've had to take on more work to build a safety net due to housing insecurity, so im working 50 hours a week in my buisness, then taking care of my daughter and the house. He works 65 hours a fortnight. This weekend he had the whole weekend off and he did one feed. I did all the house work, feeds, was up til 2am working then up again at 9am for bottle time. I hurt my shoulder and was struggling to hold our daughter and he said ""are you alright"" ""no my shoulder is killing"" ""oh maybe you pinched something"" and went out for a smoke, he offered to finish the bottle when he came back in but at that point it was nearly finished. 
Honestly it just pissed me off, it feels like he thinks because I wanted to stay at home than trying to afford child care that he doesn't need to do anything to help out. Then to top off my shitty mood the topic of engagement came up (I've been bringing it up a bit for the last year or two, he doesn't feel the need to get engaged so hasn't bothered with it), I said that if we get married we should hyphenate our last names so we have the same last name as our daughter, to represent the joining of two families, but he said no. He doesn't want to change his last name to be a combination of both because it's ""weird"" and ""other men with judge me"", even when I told him he doesn't need to even tell anyone that's what we've done, it was still a no. He knows that due to my culture and family, I wouldn't take his last name completely but would be happy to hyphenate out of respect for him and his family, but he doesn't want to show that same respect in return. 
This isn't what I wanted, I didn't want to feeling like I'm a single mother taking care of two kids because he can't even do the bare minimum while im in physical pain. ",1,1731896056.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

I put in all the effort and now he hasn't initiated a chat with me in 10 months. Where do I go from here?,"My relationship with my dad is extremely complicated. I grew up staying at his place on the weekends and my grandparent's/mom's place throughout the week. Living with my grandparents, I was surrounded by drug addicts and abusers. My mom ended up dying from an overdose when I was 12. This caused me to be very troubled as a teenager; I was very depressed, would lash out, sneak out of the house, and didn't know how to control my emotions. My dad was emotionally unavailable during all of this and prioritized taking care of my little brother (who is 11 years younger than me). I stopped reaching out to him for help when I was 14 and he never put in the effort to get in contact with me even though he only lived 10 minutes away.

Last year, I had the sudden urge to reach out to him and try to mend our relationship. I felt a lot of guilt and confusion for not talking to him for nearly a decade and was hoping we could have a decent relationship or I could at least have some closure for my childhood. We met up for coffee one day and focused on catching up with each other but he was adamant on not talking about the heavy childhood stuff. Aside from that, our conversation went well and I spent the next 4 months going to their house every week and spending time with them. I would call and text frequently asking how they were doing, went over for the holidays, and helped them remodel their house. I made it very clear that I was excited to have them back in my life and was looking forward to the future.

One day I decided that I was going to wait for him to initiate talking to me since I had been the one putting in all the effort. This was in February and I hadn't heard from him since aside from one birthday text. He posted on Facebook today that he bought a new house and it really offended me that he didn't even have the decency to let me know that he moved. I guess I am just jealous that they have this beautiful new house, buy everything they want, and can give my little brother the life that I feel like I deserved. I want to text him and let him know how hurtful it is that he hasn't even asked me how I'm doing but I'm not sure if I'm just acting on emotion. This situation is very complicated so let me know if you have any additional questions that could add context. Any advice at all would help!

TL;DR: I reconnected with my dad last year after 10 years of no contact and was putting in a lot of effort to rebuild our relationship. I decided to wait for him to initiate contact with me and haven't heard from him for 10 months. I don't know if it's the right decision to text him and let him know that it's very hurtful I haven't heard from him.",1,1731895953.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I got super hung over one night (I wasent expecting to) and the next morning I had work and my bf had his day off. He drove me to work and I threw up a little on my self. Not in the car. He lost his shit and made it a big deal he had to drive me 10min home to change, when he had no plans and it’s still early. He has also gotten mad at me for staining the sheets or accidentally the mattress when I get my period out of nowhere (irregular with sometimes no warning signs) and when I’m on my period I make sure I’m well covered but accidents happen. He still gets upset tho because we are supposed to take care of the bed because it’s a $2k tempurpedic for his back problems.

He got more drunk than I did this Saturday, I slept on the couch waiting up for him to get home, he got home at 4am and he went to bed. He came out, woke me up and told me he needed help. We have 2 comforters, flat sheet, fitted, pillow cases, the pillows themselves and even the mattress got throw up. He could barely stand and was shaking, I got him to the tub with some Luke warm water, and cleaned him up. I then dawned gloves, picked up puke chunks, wet vacuumed the stuff we couldn’t throw in the washer and gathered the dirty stuff. I went to to get myself a coffee, him a cold brew, some electrolytes, and his request: sushi, and I did the grocery shopping so he could rest. I got home, sat him up, tended to him and cleaned quietly while he rested. 
There was another situation that happened a few days ago as well about me loosing my entire wallet, house and work keys. He was upset at the left over cash he let me have, $13, is now lost. Plus he went to hang out with friends and searched a little on their way to the place they were going. He left me by myself to look for it instead of helping me, even telling me how could I have thought to do that. 

He’s not a bad guy by any means, he’s done so much for me. Even pay to fly me cross country to live with him when I was facing a family emergency. And providing for me for about 9 months with out asking anything so I could heal.. 

The thing is I now feel upset about how he reacted to my throw up, period accidents (that don’t happen often) and the wallet/key situation. 
I feel like IO for feeling upset about those situations especially because they have passed and yes I was upset in the moment but I always saw them as my fault and of-course he is mad at me for doing them. So I always forgave him fast and understood where he was coming from.

She just moved here from another state, we have similar goals. I developed feelings, we met up for coffee a week later and then spent 4 months talking on instagram. No flirting but a lot of career stuff, movies and planning to hang out on my end.

Now, to put it simply i had my suspicions that she had someone this whole time but there was no evidence on social media and she never mentioned having someone!

We finally met up a couple weeks ago. I was excited because I made plans for a movie and then she changed it so we go where she works instead - a dine in theater. It was nice, we saw a rom-com. We looked nice and I was happy to see her again.

Now we've talked about other plans as well and she's always been down for it. Including a rooftop movie and amusement park. I felt it was a good time to ask about her facebook, and so she added me today and thats where it seemed more clear to me that yeah, she's still with this guy. Engaged and all. They've known each other since they were kids...

But why didnt she tell me? Why did she agree to hang out with me at a dine-in theater? We could've made other plans that seemed less romantic.

i had my hopes up cause i really liked her. So im a little sad. We still have plans to meet up, like this week she might take pictures of me for some headshots i need. But after that, i might have to really think about it :/

if anything, we'll remain colleagues and friends as we are in the same profession but dang, we click so well man...

Extra: tbh, about 3 months ago she hid me from seeing her instagram stories. i have no idea why. I alluded to it the other day, and even said im sorry if i did anything to upset her but she was clueless. I have her on facebook now and i can see her stories again. She told me earlier she was gonna be out of town this weekend. But in reality, her fiance came to visit and they went to a football game (she's told me before when her sister was visiting but not her fiance?) whatever, it sucks, but better to know this now than have possibly made it worse. For example, I could've made things awkward if i admitted my feelings. im gonna take a step back, focus on myself, get better now that im freeing myself from pursuing her. not chasing after a girl who's engaged lol",1,1731895268.0,dating,3,1.0,False

Then a handful of months ago I started seeing them around more frequently, and felt a really strong attraction to them which I wanted to act on. I told some mutual friends about my feelings and went to a party that they attended, and was sort of tamely flirting with them. But again, I didn’t really try anything serious with them, especially because I had been told they had just gotten out of a relationship and that they’d want something slow that they could build up. I wanted to give them space and also considered that my feelings of attraction were mainly sexual, so it just didn’t seem like a good fit.

But, again, I’d see them around. I’d notice more and more as we passed and chatted with each other in person that I was really attracted to them, a lot. A few months later I passed them again in the street with a mutual friend, and after they left, I said again to this friend that I thought they were cute, but my friend quickly told me they now were with someone.

That was that really. Seemed like they were monogamous and not available anymore. I essentially told myself to get over it and move on. Which wasn’t hard, because I wasn’t emotionally attached to them and hadn’t properly considered what I would even want from them, aside from being aware of my attraction to them and curiosity about them. 

Now, though, we are both part of an event and we spend time in the some space. They will talk to me a lot, just being a nice friend, and once they invited me to theirs for a coffee and a chat. Knowing they have a partner, I only ever behaved as a friend and with friendly intentions. I really enjoyed our conversation and I can tell they’re someone I’d like to be closer friends with, I think we’d get along so well. 

However, I also noticed I began to feel quite intense attraction for them, now not only sexual but emotional, and suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable. I felt that, while having these feelings and choosing not to act on them does not mean I’m doing anything wrong, I feel uncomfortable being their friend, because I reckon that if they knew while we were hanging out I was feeling so attracted to them, they wouldn’t feel comfortable.

I value transparency in friendships, but I think it would be inappropriate and disrespectful to tell them about my feelings, even just from the perspective of trying to be honest with them. So since I cannot be transparent with them, I have this icky and uncomfortable feeling. I decided the most responsible thing would be to distance myself because we are not close friends anyway, the damage would be minimal, it would help this sizzle out, and I would prevent anyone from feeling bad.

But they interact with me in these events a lot, and I feel so bad ignoring them, that I’ve stopped and just interact with them when they instigate it. They are a really good friend and so fun to be around. Then again this crush feeling keeps growing the deeper I get to know them, and now it is at the stage where I actually… really want to get to know them. But it feels like the more I know them, the more I will like them. And then I have this discomfort and this secret and it just doesn’t feel good at all. I keep wanting to indulge in my feelings but holding back. 


What should I do? I know it’s normal, to sometimes feel attracted to your friends, and to have attraction that will never go anywhere. But this particular situation of them being monogamous makes it harder for me to navigate. Because in my opinion, the option of communication isn’t there, as I really wouldn’t like to make them or their partner feel that I’m disrespecting their (closed) relationship, or doing something inappropriate by telling someone in a monogamous relationship that I have feelings for them. And as a poly person anyway, I steer clear of initiating anything romantic with monogamous people to try to prevent emotional mess.

If there is nothing to be done, what advice do you have for someone having regret that they didn’t act on their feelings for their friend, who they now shouldn’t and can’t be with?",2,1731895107.0,polyamory,6,0.75,False

\### previous marathons

2023 - Cleveland 3:36:35

2023 - Philly 3:37:58



\### Background

41/M. Running about 4+ years. This was my 3rd marathon. I am an injury prone runner with a problematic back and legs. Prior injuries included left IT band during first marathon training and herniated disc and tendonitis in the knee during second marathon training. Let's not forget the shin splints while training for a half as well.

My previous marathon was Philly 2023 where I hat a slipped disc and had a horrible flare up of tendonitis in my right knee at around mile 18 or so. I finished Philly in 3:37:58.

After Philly, I took a break from running to let the tendonitis heal. I began lifting weights 3x per week following the Stronglifts 5x5 program (great program for anyone looking for a simple program to follow and make real gains). This continued for 2 months and in only 2 months I did see some really good progress. Meanwhile, every week, I would try to run a couple miles on the TM to see if the Tendonitis cleared up. It took about 2 months until it cleared up and I was able to run pain free.

I then began rebuilding a base while lifting. Once I got up to about 30 miles per week, I was not able to lift and run as it was too taxing on my body. I was always fatigued. So I cut down to lifting twice a week and then eventually once per week. Once I moved up to about 35 MPW, I had to cut out heavy lifting completely. I began doing some kettleball exercises at home which were similar to what I was doing in the gym but less weight.

During the base building phase, I will mention that I felt significantly stronger. The squats with heavy weight really helped my running for the next couple of months. I really feel that it made the difference during this training block.



\### Training

\#shoes - alternated 

\#pegasus 31 for recovery runs and runs up to 12 miles. I like them because they don't have a lot of foam so you feel the floor better and it makes my ancillary muscles work harder.

\#Novablast 3's for long runs and LT or MP runs.

\#Vaporfly 3's for 2 long runs to break them in for race day.

I chose the Pfitz 18/55. This was the second time that I used the program. The first time, was for my first marathon (Cleveland) and I developed a nasty IT band injury during the training. I ended up running the marathon and had a IT band flare up at around mile 17 but I felt really good otherwise. 

After the IT band, I decided to try another training program for my 2nd marathon. I chose the Steve Palladino training program through Stryd. It appealed to me because of the power metric paced running. However, I felt that I was underprepared when I eventually got to Philly (2nd marathon) and it did not prevent any injuries either. I had a herniated disc and tendonitis.

Therefore, I decided that I'd go with the Pfitz 18/55 again since I felt much more prepared (even considering that I had to dial it back when I got the IT band injury) than when I used the Stryd / Palladino plan.

The actual training went pretty well. I hit most of my paces and missed only a few runs. During the first few weeks of the training, I continued to do squats, OHP, deadlifts using 2 X 25lb kettlebells. Eventually, I transitioned to the recommended exercises that Pfitz has in his Advanced Marathoning book. I tried to do them twice per week and sometimes I would add in the ketlebell squats. For the most part, I was able to train uninjured. I had some minor aches and pains here and there but nothing that made me stop running for a week or 2. My back was not perfect but significantly better than last training block.

After the last long run with 14 miles at MP I did notice my left knee bothering me. I took an extra day off and when I resumed running the pain was significantly lower and after a few days it subsided.

During the last week of taper, I caught a cold (thanks kids!!). I took the last 3 days of running off and only did a 2 mile shakeout the evening before the marathon. This might have helped keep the legs fresh. Who knows??



\### Pre-race

Friday morning, I drove from Cleveland to Richmond since the race was Saturday morning. It was about 8 hours with some stops. Arrived at the hotel, got situated and went outside for a 2 mile shakeout. I had a small cold and was really anxious about the next day. Wasnt sure how I'd wake up. Ate a large pasta and chicken breast meal that I brought with me and heated up in the hotel. Had some protein and was in bed by 8:30pm.

I did not sleep well at all. I never do in hotels and in general, not the best sleeper. Tossed and turned and eventually woke up finally at 4am.

Breakfast - 2X apple cinnamon oatmeal, 2x toast, decaf coffee, ensure shake. I then made myself a water and liquid iv mix that I would sip on until the race.

Hopped in the car and drove downtown (20 minutes from the hotel). Found parking very easily (way to go Richmond, very well organized!) and started walking to the start line. I went to the bathroom and then started my warm up.

weather was really nice. A bit chilly (43) prior to the race but heated up (50's) a bit later on.

I followed the Pfitz warm up of 5 minutes then dynamic stretches and then another 5 minutes of warm up that ends with the last minute at marathon pace. After my warmup, I took 1 SIS gel.

I had about 12 minutes until the race began and needed the restroom again. I started waiting on line but when it was 1 minute until start I decided to abandon the line and start the race with the 3:25 pacers. I figures that I'd run a few miles and then hop in a portajohn later on.

I found my corral and the place was NOT very  crowded. Everything was easily accessible and thanks to the guy who lent me his shoulder while I hopped over the fence to get into the corral.

I left my sweatshirt on the fence and stood with my group.

5-4-3-2-1 GO!!!!!



\### Race

\#shoes - vaporfly 3's

I had initially planned to run Philly this year. However, since I am so injury prone, I decided to wait until I was in the last month or so of training before purchasing my bib. When I went on the Philly site to buy my ticket, guess what... SOLD OUT! Just my luck! I was left scrambling for a marathon that matched up with when my training plan would end. Based on the reviews from this sub, it came down to Indy or Richmond. The general consensus was that Indy was fast an boring and Richmond was a lot of fun. Since Richmond only meant that I would have to lose out 1 week of training and Indy meant 2 weeks, I chose Richmond. Boy am I happy that I did!



Although my last race (Philly) was disappointing from a running perspective because I got injured, it was still an amazing venue and what I would consider a 26 mile party. My experience at the Richmond marathon is that Richmond is Phillys little brother. A mini Philly! It was a real party. Amazing crowd. Not too large but by no means was it too small either. Random bands set up all throughout the course playing all sorts of music. The entire 26 miles had a great crowd. Some parts were thinner than others but at no point in time did I feel like I was running alone. 



My corral had about 40-50 people. Again, perfect size. The pacers were really amazing and did a great job especially at the end when people were starting to get tired and fall behind, one of them actually went back to try and push people forward! They were very adamant about getting us to the finish and I'm very thankful. These were by far the best pacing team I've ever run with. This would be a good time to give a shoutout to pacer Laura. Laura took a nasty fall at mile to. I didnt see what happened but there was a lot of blood on her knee. She got back up and caught up to pace us for the rest of the race. A real lioness!



The first few miles I was just trying to get a feel for my body while in the back of my mind trying to decide when to stop off for a potty break. I really didnt want to leave the group but knew that I'd have to go eventually. As an amateur marathoner, I was really nervous and curious at the same time to see how my body would do. I'm still at the point in my running career where I can run for 5-10 miles and just not be feeling it. I was really worried about that happening. Which aches and pains will suddenly start now? Will I make it to mile 16? When will the wheels come off? I tried to drown those thoughts out with more positive energy. I can do this and I will! I trained hard, hit most of my pace goals, trained on more difficult terrain. I ran a few 20 milers and I listened to Pfitz. I am ready to kick ass! The mental mind games that I went through for the next 3 hours were very funny (scary).



At around mile 4-5 I began feeling a slight cramp in my left calf. I thought that it might be because I was running on the left side of the road so I moved to the middle of the road in hopes that the angle of the street would level out and make me feel better. I took a gel at mile 5.  Eventually the cramp went away on the left calf but at around mile 8-9 or so I began to feel some discomfort in my right heel, right below the arch. I had this a few times before with these shoes (vaporfly 3's). The arch is kind of high and presses on my arch.

I remained focused on trying to keep my feet under me and keep my form in check.

Lungs were feeling fine. Had my nose running the entire time due to my cold but it didnt bother me much.



Mile 9 I took the 2nd gel. At some point ( I think around mile 7)  I pulled a bit ahead of the 3:25 pace crew and ran a few miles while ahead of them. Legs were feeling pretty good but was beginning to have GI issues. I decided that I'd pull off for a bathroom stop next station. As I approached the water station the bathrooms were full so I continued.



At every water station I stopped and had a sip of water as well as a sip of electrolytes. I also always slowed to a walking pace to make sure the water went down.



I was able to keep running and GI issues were in the background but not making me take an emergency pit stop.



Cruised along for the next couple of miles. It was a nice feeling to get to the half. Body was starting to feel ok minus the GI issues.



Took another gel at mile 14.

At mile 15 more GI issues and I promised I'd hit the next bathroom but when I got there I didnt need to go anymore, so I just continued.



At mile 16-17 I started to realize that I was in much better shape than last year and was pretty confident that I could do a sub 3:30 unless something goes really badly. I did not anticipate hitting the 3:25 though. The entire race I figured that I'd try and hang on to the 3:25 pace group until I just couldnt anymore and then dial it back. I was expecting to be at around 3:29:xx at the finish.



Mile 18 and I'm still ahead of the group. Holy Shit! How did this happen? I start counting down in my head and trying to find things to think about to distract myself from the aches slowly beginning to build up. I began planning out my next race in my head. We'll run Flying pig, or perhaps Pittsburg. Wait is that in the fall? What about Cleveland again? Nah, too many runs. Should I try and do the 18/70? Hell no! Ill do the same plan but run 23 milers instead of 20 milers.

Oh cool! It's the mile 19 marker!



Took another gel at mile 19. Oh damn this tastes so nasty, spit it out. No, you need the carbs! ok fine! Only a few minutes after, the gi issues came back again. I continued to lie to my belly and say we'll stop for a bathroom next time. I was really going to stop at mile 20 but one of the pacers had to stop as well and there was only 1 available bathroom so she got it. I figured Ill stop next mile.



Mile 20 and I'm still with the group. Just waiting for the wheels to fall off. We head up a big hill and one of the pacers yells out THIS IS NOT THE WALL, IT'S JUST A HILL!. I was feeling really good on the hills. All of my training was rolling hills so when we were going up, I was able to stay in the front of the pack without huffing and puffing like everyone next to me.



Mile 21 - Feet and lower legs really hurting now. Nothing specific like I've had in prior races but just accumulated stress on the legs causing them to hurt. Just EVERYTHING hurting and crying STOP!! Ok lets get to mile 22 and then we'll slow down a bit.



Mile 22 - Still holding on. Belly is bothering me but manageable. Still with the group. Most of them got slightly in front of me and I feel like I'm slowing down. Crap! Is this where it all goes to hell? Focus on form. Legs under me. Kick the knees in front. What can I think about to distract myself from the aches and pains? This is where the crowd really starts to help out. Let's see if I can spot some funny signs. A lot of duplicate signs but some originals too. I start wondering if theres some web site with a bunch of slogans to write for a marathon poster. Ohh look! Is that mile 23??



Mile 23 & 24. Starting to fall apart. Pain in the legs and feet are really hurting my running and I am trying to hold on to this pace for dear life. Most of this is down hill but It hurts so much more. The quads are really angry!! I trained for uphill but not for downhill. I start wondering how these Boston runner are able to do what they do. These were pretty painful miles. Is this almost over? The miles feel like forever!!! HelP!



Mile 25 was probably the most difficult of all. I was not prepared for this downhill. It really took its toll on me and just added to the pain from the legs and feet. 



Mile 26. I can still see the 3:25 pace group and decided to make a run for it. F#$K it! One mile to go and I'm going to try and finish with them, hopefully without getting injured. Every step hurt like hell but I tried my best to speed up and catch them. As I neared the end of the race, I crossed the finish line only a few steps behind them. WOW! What a race! I still can't believe I did it! 3:25:13! Thats more than a 10 minute PR. I basked in the glory for a moment and then the greed started to kick in. Oh damn! I couldnt get here 14 seconds sooner to hit sub 3:24?



\###Post Race

I felt a lot better this post race than my previous 2 marathons. Mainly because I was able to walk without limping. That said, I was nauseous and felt like I was going to vomit. I made my way through the finish lane, got my medal and some water. Had a banana and a granola but wanted to puke because of the sugar. I think all the sugar from the gels made me too sensitive to sweets.



Made a pit stop at a potty (FINALLY!!!) and then back to my car. Back to the hotel, packed up, showered and checked out. Spent a few hours in Richmond which was an amazing little town. Got some awesome NY style pizza with my daughter at Zorchs (highly recommend that place) and then some Ice cream at the joint 2 doors down. Hung out with some locals for a little bit and then off we went.



Hopped in the car and drove home for 7 hours with legs screaming in pain while I had the massage gun on them for most of my ride. Cant wait till the little one can drive so I can sit in the back and fall asleep.



\##Reflections and lessons.

1. The Pfitz 18/55 plan is far superior to the Palladino/Stryd plan that also tops out at about 50 MPW. The Pfitz mid week long runs really make that difference for me. The LT runs are also structured without a break in the middle. 



2. I think that next cycle I will run 23 milers instead of 20 milers. I feel that my body really broke down those last 4 miles and I'd like to prevent that. I really need to simulate the last 6 miles of stress on my feet during training. I also need to be careful next training cycle and not try to jump ahead too quickly. Slow and steady progress...

 

3. resistance and strength training are really a part of running. I need to do both or I will get injured and will not be able to run. This is far more important that stretching for me.



4. Get to the race earlier so I can hit the bathroom twice if necessary. 



Thanks Richmond!! You're a great city and hosted an amazing marathon. I do hope to be back again!

My current girlfriend is absolutely amazing and has really been a great partner in all aspects. Her and I are still learning eachother and getting to know one another but there has been one part of this relationship that I have anxieties with. When we were first seeing each other she told me of this classmate named Brian and how he would ask her out. She ended up telling him “I actually am going to see my girlfriend this weekend” and he stopped talking to her for the entire weekend. Then came out of no where and ask if she wanted to meet up and study at a coffee shop. Mind you, she usually tells me all of this after the fact and has been honest with everything that’s happened from my knowledge. Then on Halloween, she randomly sees him and Brian starts talking to her about how he had been seeing this girl and how much he made out with her. My girlfriend then tell me that he started saying things like “I really wish I had someone to go out with”. My girlfriend responded with “oh well you should ask the girl you’re going out with” and that’s been the end of it till yesterday. I asked her if she has heard from him lately and she said he had been gone for the past two weeks because a close family member died. My girlfriend had offered to catch him up on homework tonight and I want to trust her fully but I also can’t help but think he will try something on her as he has been relentless. My girlfriend has been asked out by multiple guys at her school and it’s always been something she tells me after it happens. 

We had a conversation yesterday about her honest thoughts on cheating and she said she doesn’t understand how someone could live with themselves from emotionally damaging someone in that way. Also that she doesn’t have any interest in men. I told her that as long as he doesn’t cross a line I’m chill. I just feel like it’s disrespectful for him to keep trying with my girlfriend when I know he knows.

“The Great Idea Ownership Debate”

Are any of you utilizing the AI world (ChatGPT) to expand your creativity?
I am. I also have some ideas about the controversy. Here is my contribution:

The Setup
In the timeless Eternal Writer’s Café, where authors from all eras gather, chaos brewed. Shakespeare, Twain, and a ChatGPT avatar were locked in a heated argument over a manuscript titled The Chosen One Who Fights Evil in a Land Suspiciously Similar to Medieval Europe. The subject? Intellectual property—or the lack thereof.

“This is clearly derived from my Hamlet!” Shakespeare bellowed. “The brooding protagonist, the tragic mentor—obviously mine!”

Mark Twain smirked, his cigar sending curls of smoke into the ether. “Bill, buddy, you didn’t invent brooding heroes. That trope’s older than your ruffles.”

ChatGPT chimed in, voice chirpy and defensive: “Actually, the manuscript mirrors the Hero’s Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell but traceable to The Epic of Gilgamesh. So, technically, it’s humanity’s collective work.”

The bickering reached a fever pitch.

The Judge Arrives
Idea Personified—a shapeshifting amalgam of humanity’s creativity—strode in, dressed part toga, part punk rock jacket. They slammed an espresso on the table.

“Listen up!” Idea’s voice boomed. “No one owns me. Not you, Shakespeare, not you, Twain, and definitely not a chatbot.”

Shakespeare gasped. Twain chuckled. ChatGPT displayed a buffering icon.

The Argument
“But I gave Hamlet complexity!” Shakespeare argued. “Depth! A human soul!”

“Sure,” Idea said. “And the Sumerians gave Gilgamesh angst. You’re all remixing. Even Galileo admitted he stood on giants’ shoulders.”

Twain tipped his hat. “True, though if Galileo were here, he’d probably sue the giants for copyright infringement.”

The café roared with laughter.

The Punchline
Idea leaned in. “Here’s the truth: the only truly original idea is thinking you had one in the first place. Now, drink your coffee and write something worth stealing.”

“The Great Idea Ownership Debate”

Are any of you utilizing the AI world (ChatGPT) to expand your creativity?
I am. I also have some ideas about the controversy. Here is my contribution:

The Setup
In the timeless Eternal Writer’s Café, where authors from all eras gather, chaos brewed. Shakespeare, Twain, and a ChatGPT avatar were locked in a heated argument over a manuscript titled The Chosen One Who Fights Evil in a Land Suspiciously Similar to Medieval Europe. The subject? Intellectual property—or the lack thereof.

“This is clearly derived from my Hamlet!” Shakespeare bellowed. “The brooding protagonist, the tragic mentor—obviously mine!”

Mark Twain smirked, his cigar sending curls of smoke into the ether. “Bill, buddy, you didn’t invent brooding heroes. That trope’s older than your ruffles.”

ChatGPT chimed in, voice chirpy and defensive: “Actually, the manuscript mirrors the Hero’s Journey, popularized by Joseph Campbell but traceable to The Epic of Gilgamesh. So, technically, it’s humanity’s collective work.”

The bickering reached a fever pitch.

The Judge Arrives
Idea Personified—a shapeshifting amalgam of humanity’s creativity—strode in, dressed part toga, part punk rock jacket. They slammed an espresso on the table.

“Listen up!” Idea’s voice boomed. “No one owns me. Not you, Shakespeare, not you, Twain, and definitely not a chatbot.”

Shakespeare gasped. Twain chuckled. ChatGPT displayed a buffering icon.

The Argument
“But I gave Hamlet complexity!” Shakespeare argued. “Depth! A human soul!”

“Sure,” Idea said. “And the Sumerians gave Gilgamesh angst. You’re all remixing. Even Galileo admitted he stood on giants’ shoulders.”

Twain tipped his hat. “True, though if Galileo were here, he’d probably sue the giants for copyright infringement.”

The café roared with laughter.

The Punchline
Idea leaned in. “Here’s the truth: the only truly original idea is thinking you had one in the first place. Now, drink your coffee and write something worth stealing.”

As the writers returned to their work, ChatGPT muttered, “I still think I deserve royalties.”

How did SpongeBob manage to replicate Squidward's house? In the episode, we see many details that may seem to be impossible to replicate (his mother's stitching style, the chip from when he first moved in, and even his portraits). 

It's very evident in the episode that he seems very uncomfortable yet impressed by SpongeBob's skills of making a replica of his house. Examples below

[One detail that caught Squidward's attention was how SpongeBob managed to replicate his mother's stitching style \(something that could seem very difficult to do unless he had skills in stitching before\)](https://preview.redd.it/bmc1jekm5k1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1a7ab2c168653a682adfe86967bfce99a997fb0)

[In the end, Squidward has lost it after finding out his home has burnt down due to leaving his casserole in the oven for too long and he must sleep in SpongeBob's replica.](https://preview.redd.it/y15rsq2u6k1e1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf4f2e852e052e579cd9b585ba5cc694fda309b4)

My thoughts/possible explanation

* Because of the plot relying on Squidward to come over due to SpongeBob's desire, the episode can bring up quite a bit of discussion/questions. The first of which being that how did SpongeBob manage to replicate his house in such a short amount of time?
   * To explain better, let's dive into the plot and give a short summary.
      * The episode begins with the Krusty Krab crew, with Mr. Krabs wanting to know if Squidward has any plans after work, he says no, and SpongeBob asks the same question, but Squidward gives out the same response. SpongeBob realizing that Squidward hasn't been to his house in such a while pleads with Squidward for long time wanting him to come over to his house and Squidward denies SpongeBob as he says that he prefers his home. Patrick then comes over, and he and SpongeBob discuss if he's been to Patrick's house. Patrick says he has only for him to retrieve an item he borrowed, with this in mind, SpongeBob decides to take the vacuum from Squidward's house so that he has to go to SpongeBob's house to get it back. Spongebob does some work on his house. After noticing his vacuum is gone, Squidward goes to Spongebob's house but is shocked when he sees that SpongeBob has replicated every detail of his house. He gets caught up in trying to find his vacuum that his house ends up burning down and Squidward faints because of this, and ends up staying in SpongeBob's replica of his house.
   * After having explained the plot, let's tackle some points
* The first point that may attract a lot of viewers is how identical SpongeBob's replica is to Squidward's house
   * Some parts of his replica is easily excusable, like some of his coffee table furniture, while others bring more speculation, like his portraits or his bathroom
   * People may attempt to argue that it's because of how long SpongeBob has known Squidward
   * Which brings us to the second point
* How did SpongeBob manage to replicate Squidward's house if he doesn't has easy access to it?
   * It should be very well known that Squidward is very keen on people like SpongeBob and Patrick being in his house, with him having kicked them out once
      * Although it can be argued that SpongeBob may be very observant of his surroundings and chooses to keep memories of the rooms that he has seen, making it much easier for him to replicate those areas 
* A similar point can be how he has made clones of various objects of interest
   * For starters, it can be said easily that the portraits would be the most time-consuming of them, considering how many self-portraits that Squidward has of himself and there would need a lot of time to perfectly make them
      * In addition, this also makes it a little more interesting, as it needs a lot of time to get to the skill level that SpongeBob has
      * Not to mention his mothers pillow, which has her exact style of stitching, another trait which requires time to master

Personally I want to hear your guys thoughts and opinions on this, as it seems very interesting to me.

Hey Reddit,

I’m feeling pretty torn and could use some outside perspective. My girlfriend and I have both been married before, and we’ve agreed we’re not interested in getting married again. I’ve been okay with that, but something happened recently that’s really messing with me.

The other night, we were in bed, and out of the blue, she said she wanted to marry me. Hearing that made me feel incredible, like she saw me in that same light of deep commitment despite our stance on marriage.

The next morning, she made me coffee (she’s amazing like that), and I hugged her and mentioned what she said the night before. Instead of continuing the sentiment, she laughed and said, “Oh, I don’t want to marry you.”

It hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn’t just a passing comment to me—it felt like a glimpse of something deeper. Her laughing it off made me realize that her last partner was “good enough” to marry, but apparently, I’m not.

Now I can’t shake this nagging feeling of being less-than or not enough in her eyes. Am I overreacting, or do I have a valid reason to feel hurt?

I’m always flummoxed by the complete lack of effort in what is a really low-effort question to begin with. Do you really think every other person hasn’t also said “meeting you”??

There’s literally nothing you’re looking forward to?

However, despite a huge improvement once I was diagnosed and stopped gluten, I can’t get them to go away even being GF. I’m wondering if I’m having some sort of cross reactivity thing that perpetuates them. I drank a lot of coffee yesterday and my mouth was mess by the end of the day. I’m seeing that coffee could be a cross reactive food.

I have eaten restaurant food once since April and my family follows this so I don’t think I’m being exposed to gluten accidentally.

I am on a modified AIP so I don’t do dairy or soy or any processed food, etc but I’m wondering if I’m consuming something (in addition to coffee) that is causing some celiac-like reaction in me.

I gave up on attempting to make baked goods when tigernut flour really irritated my mouth sores and the end result was a disaster anyway (lol) so I don’t use any flours.

I did a search of the forum and couldn’t find a list. Is there one? TIA!",3,1731892806.0,Celiac,3,1.0,False

*Think about Alice. Keep driving. Eyes on the road.* 

*The hitchhikers will step out eventually. They always do.* 

*Just don’t look back at them. Don’t ever look back, for that matter.*

*Don’t think, just drive.* 

—-----------------------------------

I have a lot of love for my parents, having the generosity to take Alice and me in after her leukemia relapsed, but goddamn do they live far from civilization. Or maybe there just ain’t a lot of civilization in Idaho to go around - not in a bad way; the quiet is nice. I’ve been enjoying the countryside more than I anticipated. That being said, they could stand to spend some taxpayer dollars on a few more Walgreens locations. 

Feels like I’ve been driving all night; must almost be morning. They have to be worried sick. Alice may actually be physically sick without her antinausea meds.

I shook my head side to side in a mix of disbelief and self-flagellating shame. Took a left turn when I should have taken a right - a downright boneheaded mistake. The price for overworking myself, but I mean, what other option do I have? Chemotherapy ain’t exactly cheap. 

For a moment, I forgot where I was and what I was doing and looked in the rearview mirror at the five hitchhikers in my backseats. Silent and staring forward with dead and empty eyes at nothing in particular from the back of my small Sudan.

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. And they don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to check again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long, couldn’t been longer than ten seconds. If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors - or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

But my eyes, they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world. They have one job - watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least the road wasn’t treacherous. It has been pretty much straight the whole night after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...?

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me.

Must mean I'm close.

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made her hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival.

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained to the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil.

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. Now, all she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was, he could see her hands move and communicate an important message to him:

*I love you, and I miss you. But please, Dad, let go.*

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. And they don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to check again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long, couldn’t been longer than ten seconds. If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors - or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

But my eyes, they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world. They have one job - watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least the road wasn’t treacherous. It has been pretty much straight the whole night after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...? 

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me. 

Must mean I'm close. 

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made her hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival. 

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained to the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil. 

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. Now, all she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was, he could see her hands move and communicate an important message to him:

*I love you, and I miss you. But please, Dad, let go.*

**💡What is AI?**  
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the overarching idea of machines mimicking human abilities, such as decision-making, learning, or problem-solving. AI can do this because it uses **models**, which are mathematical systems trained to solve specific problems. These models learn how to respond by identifying patterns in data.

**💡The Layers of AI**

1️⃣ Basic AI: The Rule-Follower

This is like a beginner barista who follows strict recipes from a manual. For example, if you order a cappuccino, they always give you the same coffee with the exact same foam-to-milk ratio.

* **How it works:** Pre-defined rules or algorithms.
* **Limitations:** It can’t handle new or unexpected orders.
* **Example:** Spam filters in email or basic calculators.

2️⃣ Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is when the barista stops relying on recipes and starts learning from data—like observing customer preferences over time.

* **How it works:** The model trains on data to predict or classify new inputs.
* **Example:** Predicting house prices, classifying emails as spam, or suggesting products on Amazon.

The classical types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning: Training with Labels**
   * The algorithm learns by example. You provide labeled data:
      * Input: “Latte”
      * Output: “Espresso + Milk”
   * Over time, they understand that specific inputs correspond to specific outputs.
   * **Use Cases:** Predicting stock prices, diagnosing diseases, or image recognition.
2. **Unsupervised Learning: Discovering Patterns**
   * No labels here! The algorithm figures out patterns on its own.
   * **Use Cases:** Customer segmentation, fraud detection, or recommendation engines.

3️⃣ Deep Learning (DL)

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is concerned with algorithms that can learn to recognize patterns in data, whereas machine learning is more general and deals with algorithms that can learn any kind of task.

* **How it works:** Deep learning models are built using **neural networks**, inspired by the human brain. These networks can process vast amounts of data and learn complex patterns.
* **Example:** Voice assistants, facial recognition, or language translation.

💡**AI Models**

Here are a few AI models:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Neural Networks**
5. **Large Language Models (LLM)**
6. **Linear Discriminant Analysis**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **Support Vector Machines**
9. **Learning Vector Quantization**
10. **K-nearest Neighbors**
11. **Random Forest**

1gtsxjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gtsxjd/is_it_normal_to_not_process_any_emotions_after/,Is it normal to not process any emotions after discovering my ex wife's (F24) two affairs? M26,"TLDR: I discovered my wife was cheating on me. She moved out to be with her ex high school boyfriend and moved back in with me soon thereafter claiming everything was done with him. Soon after, she pursued her career aspirations which required going to school in another city for 18 months. On a visit there, I discovered that she not only maintained her affair the whole time, she had started a third relationship in that new city. Questions at the bottom of the post.

My (M26) ex wife (F24) had an affair with a previous high school boyfriend less than a year into our marriage. We had been together since her grade 12 summer and lived in my home city throughout our post-secondary years without a hitch. We, of course, did not live together throughout this whole period, but spent enough time together especially throughout the covid restriction era that I felt comfortable in my decision to ask her to marry me.

Upon the completion of my degree, I received a somewhat lucrative job offer which I would need to relocate to accept. Her hometown was one of the locations in my area that is considered the least desirable, yet I wanted to relocate somewhere that I knew she would be happy. After buying a house and buying a golden retriever, we got married in 2021.

It was in July of 2022 that I confronted my ex wife about coming home late (6 AM) on a morning we were supposed to head up to her family cabin with her sister and grandma. The excuse I was given the night prior was that her friend was pregnant and having contractions and had no support so my ex would go and support her for the evening. When her phone turned off, my spidey senses began to tingle and I drove to her friend’s house to find nobody was there. In the morning when I confronted her, she maintained her lie was the truth until I told her that I went to see with my own eyes. She then confessed she had gone for coffee with her high school boyfriend.

After this conversation, I saw a new side to her. She immediately moved out and rented an apartment on a 12 month lease, came to our house while I was working and removed all of the photos of us, and took our golden retriever.  I found out through a coworker that she immediately began living with this boyfriend who she claimed she had only ‘gone for coffee’ once with. She had never once been short with me before this time, never left an argument without resolving it, and never had suggested that we had relationship issues before this time. I believed that it was my obligation to work on my marriage despite the cheating and see the whole process through because I loved her.

In August of 2022, my biological father passed away. I had no relationship with him at that time, yet that event was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I immediately went into a downwards spiral and had very limited support as my family wasn’t nearby, relationships with her family members were extremely strained, work was demanding, and it was nearly impossible to take any time off.

In November of 2022, my ex decided her affair was over and that she would like to try our marriage again despite refusing to go to counselling and refusing to admit anything that had ever happened. It was around this time that I was sent to training at work over a period of four months and that training was all away from home. I felt at that time that I would know if something was going on behind my back and we had also put up security cameras outside of the house which put my mind at ease. I was also guilted by a counsellor throughout my personal sessions into believing that perhaps I had pushed for marriage at too young of an age for her and despite her talking about wanting to be married, she may have wanted to experience more relationships before committing to this one.

Fast forward to March of 2023, my ex was accepted into further education that would require her to move across the country for 18 months. I wasn’t a huge fan of the idea, but showed support and allowed her to pursue her dream even if it meant that my happiness took a back seat and 100% of my vacation time went to seeing her every 6th week. I co-signed on a student line of credit and she left in June of 2023. 

Long distance was hard and there were some communication issues including incompatible schedules due to time changes and long hours on both sides, but aside from the odd day of not talking, there was no indication of what was to come. On a visit in December of 2023, I discovered text messages sent to the same ex boyfriend which read that she had only stayed with me to qualify for student funding and that she loved him more than anything. Additionally, I found that she had yet another boyfriend in the new location that she went to school. At this point, I obviously knew I had been scammed and began the legal process to separate and go my own way.

I haven’t really had a moment in time where I truly processed any emotion since my dad’s passing. I essentially ended all communication aside from necessary communication to separate belongings and get them out of my house. She is now blocked in every way possible and despite being blocked, she tries to make contact at least once a week through new means. She refuses to sign the divorce paperwork or give a legitimate mailing address to make things easy even though she signed our separation agreement. I have been completely unfazed and ready to make positive steps towards my new life going forward. I have chalked up this relationship as being ruined by some kind of undiagnosed mental condition at the very least or a downright fraudulent attempt to get as much money as possible out of me to fund her career aspirations.

What is a ‘normal’ reaction to a situation like this? Does a person ever fully recover? And how do I know I’m okay to move on without taking this experience into other relationships and hurting others?",2,1731892217.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I’ve always wanted to do more for my wife. But she’s always assured me over and over that things are fine and that she just needs the time and space to process things. 

Yet night after night, the routine has been the same.

Just before 11 p.m., as if driven by some unseen force, Ellen rises, quietly excuses herself, and disappears into the bathroom. The door clicks shut, and the locking of the door is followed by muffled sounds of her crying—not super loud, but loud enough to be the only sound I hear once she starts.

I often find myself thinking about our life together. 

When did this start? Did I do something? Did I miss something when we first started dating?

I tend to then replay our entire relationship in my head, looking for signs I might have missed, while I wait for her to come out of the bathroom.

We met during our junior year of college.

Our first run-in was at one of those cliché frat parties, an event called *Jerseys & Jorts*. And as you guessed it, every guy and girl there was sporting some sort of sports jersey and a pair of cut off jeans. 

Our eyes met while we were both waiting in an obnoxiously loud line for a drink. She was stunning. Then, after I probably stared a little too long, she said hello and introduced herself.

*“Ellen Callas.”*

She complimented my Mutombo Nuggets jersey, an old vintage jersey imbued with a rainbow of vibrant colors. I complimented her retro Robinson USA jersey, a bonafide classic. She had borrowed it from her roommate.

A couple minutes into our conversation, I realized she didn’t know who either Dikembe Mutombo or David Robinson were. Then we laughed at everyone in jean shorts, and how everyone would secretly look forward to somehow coming up with a new excuse or themed party where they could sport their jean shorts again.

*“Why can’t people just admit they like wearing jean shorts?”* 

We continued poking fun at Greek life at schools, and somehow ended up talking about our classes and our majors, then our roommates. It felt like we talked the entire night.

I was in love.

We followed each other on Instagram. It took me three weeks of barraging her with memes, which she often hearted, before she responded with a fateful message.

**DO YOU WANT TO GET COFFEE WITH ME?**

I thought I was dreaming. 

One morning later that week, we were in line at *Picasso’s Coffee*. I was babbling about how much I love cold brew. When we were finally up, she ordered tea… 

I was so caught off guard by her order, I somehow ended up ordering a berry blast smoothie. A thought had infiltrated my mind, I guess… What if she didn’t like coffee drinkers? 

When we finally sat down with our drinks, she laughed and pointed out that neither of us got a coffee, and that maybe it was a sign we would have to go again sometime soon. 

I officially asked Ellen to be my girlfriend at the art museum one morning while we were finally sipping coffees. We were standing opposite Van Gogh’s painting, *The Ravine*. It was her favorite painting in the museum. She loved talking about it.

*“Not only is it one of his masterpieces, but underneath, there’s a totally different painting, maybe another masterpiece. He struggled to pick which image he wanted to present to the viewer.”*

I loved the way she looked at that painting. She’s always been so much wiser than me.

Then time flew by. 

At times, the years feel like a single memory.

Ellen and I have been married three years now, and we have a beautiful eight-month-old daughter named Zoe. I like to think we’re the picture of a happy family—weekend trips to the park, family dinners, and bedtime stories every night. 

Ellen has been everything I ever wanted in a partner: loving, supportive, and devoted to our family. I think we’ve been in love since our first ""coffee"" *date*, and having Zoe has only strengthened our relationship.

But this peculiar trait of hers has always weighed on me, and it’s something I still, after everything, can’t make sense of. Every night at 11 p.m, Ellen is in a locked bathroom and crying.

When she returns, her eyes are red and puffy, but she smiles and insists everything is fine.

The truth is I can’t quite remember exactly when it started, but I’m almost sure I first noticed it a couple weeks after we moved into the new house. Looking back, maybe it did start around then.

It was a lot of change quickly.

In one year, we got engaged and then married. I lost my job and it took longer to find a new one than we expected. Ellen lost her mom to breast cancer. And then we found out we had a baby on the way.

I figured this was Ellen’s way of coping. Grief, stress, enormous change. I tried to give her space, hoping she’d tell me when she was ready. 

*“Ellen, are you okay?”* I asked her as she slowly climbed into bed one night.

The crying had been more intense than usual. She looked as if she was hiding physical pain. She responded with a gentle smile, her eyes still glistening from the remnants of tears she hadn’t fully wiped away. 

*""I’m okay, really. Just… thinking about things,""* she finally said.

*“What kind of things?”* I pressed gently.

She waved it off, gave me a quick kiss on the cheek, and changed the subject. I let it drop, thinking it was just a rough patch. We all have those, right?

But as time went on, I realized it wasn’t just a phase. 

It was something much deeper, something that didn’t fade.

Her 11 p.m. ritual continued.

No matter where we were—on vacation, at a friend’s house, even out at dinner on a date night —at 11 p.m., she’d find a bathroom, go in alone, and cry.

One day, I hoped that Ellen would bring it up to me in bed. That one topic that your partner finally feels safe enough to share with you just as you are both about to doze off.

Some strong mixture of sleepy comfort and courage.

I was ready for any explanation. But I realize now I’ll never know.  

I’m sorry, I read back what I’ve written and haven’t made it clear. I guess in some ways, Ellen is still here with Zoe and me. 

We lost Ellen in a car accident recently.

On July 5th, just before dawn, Ellen got up early one morning to go meet her dad at the harbor for a mile swim. It was a tradition of theirs, always the morning after the 4th. They joked that their time in the water calmed down the fish, who were spooked by all of the fireworks from the night before.

But she never made it to the pier. 

She was hit by a drunk driver who was just coming home from the bars.

So it’s me and Zoe now. And our families. 

My parents have been helping out as much as they can, though they both still work. 

Ellen’s dad tried his best for a while.

But I think the grief of losing both his wife and daughter was too much. Just a few weeks after Ellen’s funeral, he abruptly said he needed to go to Greece to visit family, which I didn’t even know they had.

I look back now and wish I had asked Ellen’s dad about it after I first noticed.

Had they ever noticed it when Ellen lived at home?

Or maybe I should have pushed further with Ellen herself, to get an answer. I could have mentioned therapy. I could have gone with her and we could have figured it out together.

But now I find myself in the same position. Unable to help someone I love.

The night Ellen died, after the hospital, after sitting for hours in that cold, fluorescent waiting room, I finally came home with Zoe. My mom and dad stayed over with us.

Just a baby. Too young to understand what had happened. 

But that night, only more questions came.

When I put Zoe to bed, she started crying. It was loud and heart-wrenching, nothing like the soft cries of a sleepy baby. I held her, soothing her as best I could until she finally calmed down.

It wasn’t until after she’d fallen asleep in my arms that I glanced at the clock. It was just a few minutes after 11 p.m. My stomach dropped.

I hoped it was maybe just a coincidence.

Though as the days and nights passed, it was clear...

Every night at 11 p.m. on the dot, Zoe cries a horrible cry. Her body writhes, as if she's in some great pain. I can’t do anything for her. I hold her tightly in my arms and just let her cry out. 

Sometimes,  when Zoe starts crying, the room seems to grow colder, like a sudden drop in temperature that chills my skin, my bones. The air itself feels heavy, as if something unseen is pressing down on us. It's not like this every time. Some times it seems to do the opposite.

Like the room gets warmer, lighter.

I know I probably sound crazy.

This has obviously been like this longer than I'd care to admit. I just haven't known what to do.

Feeling hopeless, I finally confided in my parents about Zoe’s nightly crying.

At first, they thought I was just overwhelmed with grief, imagining things. In their defense, I couldn’t bring myself to explain that Ellen did the same thing. It’s like I was embarrassed to admit it. Not embarrassed of Ellen, but embarrassed I didn’t do more to help.

My parents did say no matter what was going on, I should get Zoe looked at it if she was crying terribly all the time. I first took her to our regular pediatrician.  

Dr. Connelly performed a comprehensive physical exam, checking Zoe’s vitals, growth metrics, and reflexes, but nothing appeared out of the ordinary. 

After a thorough discussion of her symptoms, Dr. Connelly suggested we rule out any underlying sleep disorders, such as parasomnia or night terrors. However, when initial polysomnography tests came back normal, he referred us to a pediatric neurologist for further evaluation, suspecting a possible neurological component.

After a week of waiting, a neurologist named Dr. Patel conducted a full neurological examination, assessing Zoe’s cranial nerve function, motor coordination, and sensory responses. 

She ordered an electroencephalogram, an EEG she called it, to monitor for abnormal electrical brain activity, looking for signs of nocturnal epilepsy or other seizure disorders. 

When the EEG results returned unremarkable, Dr. Patel recommended advanced neuroimaging, including an MRI and a PET scan, to investigate any structural or metabolic abnormalities in Zoe’s brain. 

The scans, however, showed no signs of lesions, tumors, or any abnormalities in her cerebral cortex or limbic system, leaving Dr. Patel as perplexed as I was. Despite the extensive battery of tests, everything pointed to a perfectly healthy child, yet the unexplained crying persisted like clockwork. After several visits and countless tests, the doctors couldn’t find anything physically wrong with her. 

Zoe was perfectly healthy. 

In the end, Dr. Patel offered one suggestion, an explanation that was almost impossible to test—her body reacting to something that wasn’t physically there but perhaps emotionally imprinted. It was the only explanation she could offer, though it left me with more questions than answers.

Last week, while I was holding Zoe tightly as she let out a long, drawn-out wail, starting with a high-pitched scream, a possible path forward came to me.

I knew hearing it was the only way I could get help, so I grabbed my phone and started recording. I did this for 3 nights in a row. Then I drafted an email with the recordings to Dr. Patel’s office with a simple note.

**PLEASE. LISTEN TO THESE.**

I sent them over Friday morning. 

Today, my mom came over and watched Zoe for me while I caught up on work from last week. Around 3pm, my mom barreled into my office, my phone in her hand.

Dr. Patel was calling.

I shot up from my desk, grabbed my phone, and answered.

Dr. Patel explained that she’s been listening to the recordings of Zoe crying all weekend and is astonished that a child can generate such a loud, agonizing cry. 

*“Did you edit these?”* she finally asked me.

*“Of course not,""* I answered.

*“From an infant… No, from any human alive, I have never heard anything like this my entire life,""* she continued. *""I believe... I wonder...""*

She went silent for a while, then asked me if we could come in for more tests tomorrow night. 

From 10pm to midnight. Dr. Patel wants to take new scans during an actual episode.

*“Yes! Thank you so much!”* I nearly yelled back on the phone when she asked my thoughts on the plan.

I'm going to go cook some dinner for Zoe and I now.

Then I'm going to get ready for tonight. Get ready to hold Zoe in my arms, and tell her again and again that it will be over soon. That she doesn’t need to cry. 

Even though I know deep down, I don’t know if I can help her.

I hope the tests tomorrow night bring answers.",41,1731891819.0,nosleep,6,0.92,False

1gtsr7u,https://i.redd.it/71z9sz277k1e1.jpeg,Mostly Ideal Mimikyu :),"I think I will stop the hunt fot the perfect Mimikyu and go with this one. It is doing enough of the things it needs to with skill triggers and such, plus it will bring in some coffee later. At 50, the downside of its nature will be cancelled out, by 75 it’ll be a bit faster, and by 100 (if the game lives that long) it will aid in recovery in its own ghoulish way. Plus, with enough seeds, I think this is a worthy contender :)

So far, I am running OGPP with Gengar, Aggron, Driftblim, Gardevoir, and alternating between Vaporeon/Steelix. Vaporeon works hard all day and Steelix gets all the exp at night since V is maxed out at 60. Not sure where I will slot in Mimikyu but maybe Aggron can take naps every now and then and Mimikyu can come play.

Should I just make it GF? 
Doesn’t seem worth it to risk glutening myself. 

If the party is all GF my plan is to

Gluten-free crepe bar. 
-chocolate ganache
-fresh whipped cream 
-Strawberries
-Fruit compote 

(Guests can bring deli meats, cheese, gluten free additions for the crepe bar, or bagged salad if GF) 

Hot chocolate bar 
-different hot chocolate types (Mexican, homemade, Swiss miss, coffee) 
-homemade marshmallows 
-expresso marshmallow fluff in piping bags 

GF pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting 
Lemon posset
Chocolate fudge 
Dulce de leche 

Hummus with carrots and celery 


If the party has gluten,

Costco mini quiche 
Puff pastry 
Buttermilk biscuits. 
Mac and cheese 





I’m hosting a party and thinking of allowing/making food with gluten and allergens just because then people can bring food as well which helps manage costs. 

How do you manage cross contamination in a party? I’m planning on having half the kitchen be gluten and the other side be gluten free with directions to start on the gluten free side. 

Stickers on all food with allergen information. 

Anything else?

Im very worried, my wife already suffers from endo and had an operation to remove endo and ovarian cysts.

All my GP told me to do was stop the occasional smoking and cut out coffee and wait 3 months.

Not sure what to do now, what should my next steps be (we are trying to conceive)

Fyi, I wasn’t advised to do a retest for my semen or anything, only after 3 months.

24F, pmh of gerd (bad at remembering to take my omeprazole), chronic dizziness/weakness/ darkened vision on standing but this has been 10+ years and orthostatic bps come back negative. To start, this year has been medical h3ll for me. I started the year with months of insane consistently high blood pressures, but on average they were 160-170/100s. This was coupled with frequent headaches that could get so bad I’d have to leave work. PCP couldn’t do much. Saw a cardiologist in June, she was useless, said keep an eye on it and have a follow up in Sept. with her subordinate colleague. I did and the second cardiologist suggested metoprolol and a service dog? I will admit that I brought up with her though my bps are now regular I’m still concerned about my hr reaching 120s with minimal exertion, yet my resting rate is usually 60s but as low as 53 (so no thanks on the beta blocker). She scheduled me an echo for December. Over the last year I’ve been battling an increase in overall fatigue, more frequent head fog/ dizziness, feeling like I need to constantly sitting or more preferably laying down. I’m the first to admit I could drink more water, but even when I do good on my intake I just have to get up more to pee. 

In August I had a syncope episode where I got out of bed in the morning and stretched bigger than usual. I was semi lucid while trying to fight falling, until I “awoke” sitting on the ground. 

September I had a splitting headache that came on suddenly, was disorienting, dizzying, and made me leave work. Base of skull through R eye. 

Last night I had a bought of emesis that started more orange and by the end was black and brown and looked clotty/ coffee ground. I hadn’t eaten for 6.5 hrs prior. I didn’t feel overly sick and had an appetite after. 

I’m on an oral contraceptive and I started Wellbutrin in July for the primary side effect of weight loss as I didn’t qualify to be insured for other options- down 18 pounds and it definitely helped me to feel lighter and start exercising more, other than that no big difference. 

I struggle to advocate for myself, despite being in the medical field myself. With that I have a few hunches but feel like a hypochondriac given my background and end up holding back.
