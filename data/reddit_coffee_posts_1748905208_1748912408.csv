I'm on the fence about buying a Nespresso machine and was wondering if anyone could help me.

When at home, my coffee comes from either my Tassimo pod machine, or from a pour over using a Melita single cup using fresh ground beans (although my pour over technique isn’t consistent).

I drink my coffee black and although I am not against the occasional flavored coffee, I mostly use ""regular"" medium roasted pods or beans.

I also hate the taste of Keurig's coffee.

I recently went to a hotel that had a Nespresso original machine. I tried an espresso and a lungo pod. Both tasted good (well I am not used to that strong a taste but it didn't seem bitter; just strong but flavourful)

Since I'm more of a ""over 200ml coffee "" type of guy, I went to a Nespresso store and tried a 230ml Colombian pod, with a flavor profile of 4 or 5. The taste was really bitter.

Reading up on it, I saw many comments about the virtuo line making bitter coffee. I also read that I should maybe stir the foam before drinking. I also got to think that maybe they just don’t clean the test machine often enough.

In any case, I’m wondering if this sounds like a « one-off » bad experience, or if the virtuo line is more geared toward people who either don’t take their coffee black, or drink flavored coffee?

Thanks

Grabbed two hibiscus from Sam’s Club in the middle of April. I’m in 6a, which has been colder and rainy more than usual, so they stayed inside until about 2 weeks ago, should have had plenty of sun, and water. One of them really lost A LOT of foliage. There are many new leaf buds growing, and it’s had a good share of flower buds. The overall is pretty bare, and even new leaves are yellowing and falling off. 

I’ve been good about watering (rain has really helped) and given some miracle gro plant food (tropical) and thrown in coffee grounds occasionally. 

What am I doing wrong, and can I turn this around?

1l1yogn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1l1yogn/help/,Help,"My relationship of 4 years fell apart in the matter of 3 months because of me F 21. My ex was set on traveling abroad last semester and despite me not wanting him to go I supported as a partner should. We prepped for him being gone. We knew it would be hard but we would make it work. Fast forward to a month in his abroad. I was set to see him for spring break as he bought me a ticket to go. I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to see him. But something become off within me. I had recently got off birth control (not that it makes any difference) but I had felt weird, I didn't feel as much of an urge to talk to him I grew distant. I became cold. I started having thoughts of breaking up. I felt unhappy and we were fighting over the phone. There was a lack of communication between us the majority coming from my part. When I had discussed breaking up at first he was upset and angry with me. But then wanted to make us work and promised to meet my needs and I would meet his. This left me with a lot in my stomach and I didn't know if it was the right thing to do. There was a two week period where I was back and forth and didn't know what to do. I broke things off completely in the end. I was truly upset about it but thought maybe it was the best thing to do. I reached out to my ex and he said he needed space and we would talk eventually. 

A week later I got asked out to coffee by a guy. I said yes thinking nothing of it and that it was harmless. We just got coffee talked and I went home and we were not in contact ever again. A week after that I reach out to my ex again saying that this is not what I wanted for us and I would give him my all and I apologized for being so rash. We talked like old times but he said he was hurt by me, he said he couldn't be with me again after I had gotten coffee with another guy, and he said he needed space. I begged for us to work things out but he said no. He knew I had gone on a date and was very upset. A week later he started going on dates, would tell me about them, and had been seeing this girl for his whole time abroad. He told me that they hadn't hooked up but a friend had told me that ""they haven't rlly done anything"". Not that it was my business but we were still very much in each other's business.  During our breakup I had said very un thoughtful things to him such as, we need to experience life without each other, with other people as we had been dating since junior year of highschool and we are now going into our senior year of college, and that being with him had become a weight on me. A day after our breakup he asked to be together again but I said no as it was too soon for me to know. I wish I had said yes in that moment. He then called our mutual male friends telling them not to be friends or hang out with me anymore. They all thought that was absurd and stayed out of contact with him for the coming months. My ex and I were still in on and off contact from when we broke up until two months after. It was mainly on my end as I would try to see if he was ready to make things work and each time he would say no. But we need continued to talk like normal, we cried together, we said we loved each other still. But he couldn't get over what I had done and said. It was months of torture. We couldn't let each other go more so me and it made things worse in the end. 

In between that time a friend of my ex told me he liked me after a night out 4 days after my breakup. It was a shock and I told him that I was not interested in him like that along with the fact that I had just gotten out of a relationship. My ex and I's mutual friends had told me I should not tell my ex and leave it be. Let's call these friends K, m, and L.  I thought that was the best thing to do. So I listened and once again, I regret not saying anything. 

We fully went no contact after I had contacted him upset that his friends and family unfollowed me on social media. With the months of contact as well as brewing on the situation he became angrier and harsher. Again, I should have left him alone all those months, I know that now. He had told me off told me to leave him alone, to stay out of his life, and to stop reaching out. We had always planned to meet up in May when he came back so I let it go. And we were not in contact until he was back. A lot had happened in this time frame . 

Our mutual friend ""Z"" that had said he liked me became a friend, as our friend groups would hang out every single weekend. I had told his roommates, m, L, and K multiple times and him a couple times that I was not interested and I thought that things were finally over. Yet he still continuously flirted with me and I didn't stop it from happening. In some selfish way the attention was nice, comforting. We had kissed once I admitted it was wrong and we didn't do it again. But we still were in contact as friends and hung out in groups. Our mutual friends in the group had found out and had told me that I should tell my ex. I agreed to an extent. We were not together and were not in contact, although I was still in love with him and wanted to be together again. I knew kissing Jacob was wrong and I had said of course I would tell my ex eventually. But being that he was already abroad and I had already broken up with him while he was away, I did not want to drop this big piece of information. Our mutual friend K had held it over my head and was constantly berating me with that information saying that if I didn't tell my ex he would. This was very upsetting as it was a a difficult situation. That went on for months. Until one night Z and I hooked up. It was after a drunken night at a party. All of his roommates went home, they asked him to join but he stayed behind and came to the house with me and my roommates. My one roommate went to her room with a guy she liked. My other roommate went to bed so it was only us two left. I had said I was tired and made my way to my room. He asked if he could come and I said okay. We ended up talking for a bit before he kissed me and things escalated. We didn't fully hook up. I started crying, I was embarrassed, I was guilty, overall confused and shocked by my own actions. It sounds made up, it sounds like bullshit. But truly those past few months I had been spiraling, I had been depressed, I was seeking comfort, and I received it the wrong way. Those past few months really didn't feel real. My life generally does not feel real. After that we again remained friends. I told him I didn't want to date, that we should not have been doing this as our friends are threatening me, and that it is wrong. He genuinely did not care, did not care about saying friends with my ex, with our friends, and didn't think what we had done was wrong. I was in shock. This friend Z had told me he had liked me for a while even while I was with my ex, so it somewhat made sense. But it made me feel sick. What was I doing with my life?!? 

Where I was at mentally at the time I had thought that I had nothing else to lose. M and K found out we had hooked up and that information was then held over my head. I admitted to them it was wrong, that I was going to tell, and I told them not to do this. L was able to convince K, the main person holding this over my head, not to tell or mention this unless my ex and I were seriously talking about getting back together. That was reasonable and if my ex and I were to ever talk about getting back together then of course I would tell him and I had already planned on telling him in general. Again, I never planned on hiding this forever. Z and I did not hook up for months after. I had firmly made my boundary which Is a skill I was not very good at. We truly remained acquaintances, friends, and that was that. 

Fast forward my ex had come back to the states. We met up, talked, cried, fought. He didn't want to get back together and it was all torture. He had kissed me first, we hooked up. We then met up again the next day and it was a repeat of before. We were torturing each other. He said he loved ma but couldn't be with me. I begged I pleaded I bargained but nothing. We then fought over text and I stopped reaching out. Fast forward to the beginning of summer. It was two weeks in and o reached out to him. I truly don't know why. I thought he had changed his mind. He agreed to meet up with me. We talked, he had asked me why I had broken up with him, to clarify it. To be honest, to be frank, I was scared of our future. If we were ever going to be broken up I wanted to have control. I was scared that in the future years down the line we would move in together like we dreamt but we would end up breaking up then. Making things harder. I was scared that he would fall out of love with me. That he would find someone better abroad. I was not always the best partner. He wasn't either. We were very controlling of each other and I think that left lingering resentment. We held each other back in a way. I explained to him all the fears and he told me he wished I had just communicated that. I wish I did too. He was also scared but he had more faith in us than I did I guess. I'm an anxious person, I'm a depressed person. I think the worst of situations, of people, and I let that control my life. Again we cried, hugged, kissed, fought, all of the above. I needed to let go. But it made me sick to my stomach. I went home after having a panic attack and crying for hours. We called that night. Said we missed each other. Said I love you to each other. And fell asleep over the phone. I woke up at 6am. He had too and he hung up. It broke my heart. I sent him one last message pleading to which he said no. I cried nonstop for days. I left him alone. 

Fast forward to a week later. He knows about Z. He's angry. He's calling me. I answer he asks me if it's true. I try to explain but then I was blocked on everything. 

It was M who had told him. I confronted him and he stated he was always going to tell and he told me this. That was not true. M had never directly said anything to me and would only talk to K about the situation. M never heard directly from me about this situation. He found information from snooping, going through phones, and through K who I thought was a trusted person at the time. I sent M multiple long messages. Explaining that this situation was never his to get into, never his to gossip about, and never his to share with my ex. It was my personal business that got out because of a person who I thought was a friend. And that he does not control right or wrong. I know within myself that the disruption was wrong, that my actions were wrong, but M does not get to control that. He said he did what was right as a friend to my ex. Mind you he told me and all of our friends he did not want to be friends with my ex and would talk badly about him to our friends for months on end. I'm sure some of you may say I don't have the right to be upset. But this is my life, my business, which I now know who not to tell, and very sensitive information that should have came from me and me only. I am upset my ex heard it from another person in some twisted way. My ex's mom contacted me saying I was a liar, deceitful, and disrespectful. She said that my ex always treated me right and was disappointed I did not do the same. It was upsetting as she does not know the full story, she does not know how my ex treated me and has only heard this one bad situation. Im aware it's a really bad situation it's unpleasant to hear but I don't think her reaching out on this matter was appropriate. I was very close to his family so I understand the disappointment. But I was still upset. 

As of now I'm still blocked but my ex showed up to my house while I was away, lied to my roommates, tried to go to my room, said he wanted his stuff back. Lied to them saying it was okay. And got kicked out. He then showed up again. Saying he just really wanted his stuff back and said he wanted the couch that his mom gifted me back. I gave him the most if not all of his things back the beginning of summer so I'm not sure what he needs or wants from my room. As for the couch fine take it whatever. But he will have to contact me in some form one way or another to get it back. He is set on ever speaking to me again and I will not force him to speak to me. But removing a whole couch from my home without contacting or informing is complicated, it feels weird. I just don't like that or any aspect of this. I never in my life thought I could ever act in this was and be in a situation this messy, saddening, etc. I created all of this for myself and I guess I still haven't processed it. I'll be eating and remember and suddenly I can't eat. I'll be dreaming of him then wake up and I am unable to fall asleep again. I'm sure he's going through worse. He's hurt, he hates me, I put him through hell and then hell again. I feel horrible and disgusted with myself and I wish there was something I could do to make this better. To fix this. To help him in any way I can. I understand in a lot of ways there's nothing I can do. He does not want the person who hurt him to then heal him. That's impossible. But I wish I could say something or do something to change this. Has anyone else gone through a situation like this? Has any one acted in ways they never thought they would? How do you get over this? Is there any advice anyone can give me? Does anyone think there's a solution to this? I know focusing and working on myself is important. I have been putting in the work. I'm just upset about so much right now and all I can think and worry about is him. I've considered going to church and repenting there. I've ranted to everyone I could for months on end. My closer friends/roommates have been so supportive of me but I'm hoping that ranting to other people and gaining different perspectives will be helpful. There are so many details and parts to this but that'd take forever to write. I'm not saying I'm the victim. I'm not saying I deserve pity. I just want advice and perspective.

As for the story I was talking about, it was pretty long but I know It never finished because I stopped getting updates ages ago and I just can’t find it in my 20+ pages of subscriptions (it’s an addiction I know I like characters going though hell). Anyway it was a story that was based off the main timeline except it was in a psychiatric ward as apposed to the school setting. It was really well written because at the time I remember refusing to read stories that didn’t read well. I know that is realy vague but that’s all I have to offer :( oh and I think it only got to the Misaki stairs ark before i stopped receiving updates. ",1,1748911437.0,hanakokun,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I’m one month post-op and wanted to share something I’ve been struggling with — and get some advice too

So, I know they say coffee is a no-go after surgery, and that decaf is preferred. But honestly, I love starting my morning with something warm — tea or coffee just helps me feel better and more normal. Recently, I bought that viral Java coffee protein everyone’s been talking about (yep, I fell for the gimmick 😅), and I actually like it.

Here’s the thing:
I make it with the Java coffee (10g protein), add my protein powder, plus collagen, and a splash of milk. In total, I get about 45g of protein in the morning — and I’m actually able to drink it all without issue.

But without coffee? I struggle. Protein shakes alone are so thick or taste weird, and I honestly can’t finish them.

So my question is:
👉🏾 Is coffee really that bad post-op?
👉🏾 Is there another way to get in this much protein in the morning without coffee?

I’m doing my best to follow the guidelines, but I also don’t want to lose out on protein intake early on. Any advice or personal experiences would be helpful.",1,1748910947.0,gastricsleeve,7,1.0,False

So I (25 F) have a younger brother (23 M). My brother recently moved to my city and it has been an adjustment. A few weeks ago I went to visit my parents and accidentally took home a sweater with me. My brother was going to be visiting home tomorrow so I was going to send the sweater home with him. It seemed like an easy way to get it home. I texted him if he wanted to meet for lunch to see each other and grab the sweater (nothing crazy). 

After the text I got a call from my brother saying that he can meet, but he wants me to drive to his apartment to help him move a TV instead. I reluctantly agreed over the phone. After a few minutes I told my partner that I was going to drop off the sweater and help my brother move furniture. She pointed out that I seemed annoyed that I was going to drive 50 minutes round trip to help him move furniture. Additionally, we had gone to my girlfriend’s uncle’s funeral yesterday and were exhausted from socializing all day and getting back to our apartment at 3am. 

Despite this I agreed, and sent him a text message asking him to pay me $15 if I was going to drive out there to help him to cover gas and a cup of coffee. my brother then texts back that my dad said that I can use the emergency card on my phone that is linked to my dad’s account to fill up my tank.( I never use this card my dad asked me to have this on my phone for emergencies). 

My brother has made promises like this before and often offers my parent’s money to cover him without asking them first. Our parents are well off and my brother has had a bad habit of using their money because he feels like it is also his. Every time they cut him off he finds a way to guilt back into my parents giving him money or covering his bills. Because of this history of offering my parent’s money to pay off his debts I call my dad to confirm that he said that I could use the emergency card for gas money. My dad immediately tells me that he did not say that I could do that. I understand, and ask him “so Jake(fake brother’s name) was lying”. My dad changes his story and says that asking my brother for $15 is basically asking them for money because my parents are financially support him. I apologize and tell my dad that I did not want my dad to give me money to help my brother. More so that I wanted my brother to pay me for my time and gas to make it a fair. 

Also it’s not like he doesn’t have a job he works full time and makes decent money. My dad got mad at me for not being supportive of my brother and asking them for money even though they pay my tuition.So am I the asshole for asking my brother for $15 to help him move furniture?

Catalaiya's pov:

Leo grabbed my hand and wrapped it around his arm before looking down at me with a reassuring smile. I used my other hand to slightly lift the front of my dress as we walked into the marriage office.

Leo was my elder brother and today he was walking me to the marriage office, sending me off with a stranger that our parents chose for me. Even my dress was chosen by our mother. Our mother and father had a marriage that was more a matter of family agreement... so did their parents and their parents' parents.

It was like a tradition in our family.

The only one who chose love marriage and managed to break free from this long-standing custom was my brother Leo. He has a wonderful family that he cherishes deeply.

I always believed that I could break this tradition just like Leo did, but I faced challenges along the way. I had two relationships in the past, and each time I learned something new. I wasn't as fortunate as Leo, but I am resilient.

The reason I agreed to this wedding was due to the expectations my parents had for me. My husband-to-be comes from a big business family and marrying him would be a great opportunity for my parents to grow their own business. Leo tried to argue with them, defending me but that lead to a big conflict.

This wedding was an arrangement, and I'm sure going to treat it like one. It's been two years since I stopped doing what I love and dedicated myself to my work. Making arrangements and respecting them was one of my daily tasks, and this marriage is just like any other arrangement.

Though unconventional, I chose to accept it for now.

We stepped inside the office and my eyes landed on Mason Mcbelt, the one I'm marrying. He was in a grey suit, red tie, white shirt and he has the hairstyle of a military guy. His gaze lingered on me, an inscrutable mask replacing any discernible emotion.

My parents stood on the side with big smiles on their faces. I ignored them as Leo walked us to the chairs. I sat down, not even waiting for Mason or the man behind the desk to say anything.

""She's just so eager."" I heard my mother explain behind me. I kept my face neutral, looking at the man in front of me.

He cleared his throat, adjust his tie before gesturing for Mason to sit down. He opened a black file and started to talk about marriage. I zoned out, looking at the handmade pictures behind him.

Painting and drawing were one of my favourite leisure activities. My room used to be full of canvas, each one representing the emotion that I felt when I was painting. There was sad ones, complicated ones, happy ones, unfinished ones... Now my room was just white walls with a mirror.

I felt a hand on mine and I turned to my side to look at Mason. He gave me a friendly smile before looking back at the man. I gently removed my hand, hoping he would understand my need for space.

""Now I'll need the witnesses to sign before the couple do."" The man spoke. He did say his name but I don't remember it. Our parents, including Mason parents, walked in and signed the paper.

""You'll be part of this arrangement soon,"" Mason murmured. Since our parents were busy, they didn't notice anything but Leo did. He sends a glare his way, showing him how much he dislikes him.

The man pushed the file in front of us and Mason reached out to grab a pen, eagerly signing it. Our parents noticed his action and chuckled amusedly.

I wasn't.

""Once you sign the papers, you'll exchange rings."" The man added.

Mason placed the pen on the paper before sliding it in front of me. I took the pen and signed, feeling a sense of resignation.

I only wrote a 'c' before the door slammed opened gaining our attention. I dropped the pen, turning around to look who came. None of us invited anyone to this wedding as our parents wanted it to be as quick as possible.

""Oh no,"" I heard my father curse.

Three men all suited walked in confidently. There was one in the middle and two behind him like bodyguards. The middle man particularly looked intimidating and scary. He was definitely the boss.

Who were they?

Mason stood up and so did i.

""Yes, how can we help you?"" Mason asked in his business tone.

Father walked forward, ""Mr Alvaro, why are you here?""

Alvaro? I heard this name before...

""Because of the agreement we both made."" Mr Alvaro replied, looking at father.

""What contract?"" Mason inquired cautiously.

""The contract where he mentions his daughter and my wedding."" Mr Alvaro said making my eyes widen.

Huh?

What on earth?

I felt a hand on my arm and I turned around to look at Leo.

""Just say yes,"" Leo whispered making me confused. Did he know about that?

""No, she's marrying me!"" Mason stated confidently.

""No, you're not,"" Father said shaking his head.

Mason was furious, ""What are you talking about!?""

""He's right, The agreement included a marriage arrangement as part of the terms."" Father admitted.

I took a deep breath, steadying myself. Why would he do that?

""He's not, He'll have to formally challenge my position."" Mason glared at the middle guy.

""Mason, he's Aziel Alvaro. He doesn't have to conflict you to take your place."" Leo spoke beside me, making the middle guy shift his gaze on me. His piercing greyish eyes held an intensity that made me tense.

Aziel Alvaro

**Chapter**2

Catalaiya's pov:

Aziel Alvaro

Wait a minute, I know this name.

Oh my god!

He's a formidable figure in town, known for his uncompromising control over both business and social circles. Whispers about his methods varied, but all agreed crossing him was unwise. Even local authorities seemed reluctant to interfere with his affairs.

I also heard that he has a legal business, where he works like normal people.

Why would father sign a contract with him?

Aziel walked forward, making Mason move to the side as he went to the desk. He took the paper from the file and folded it in half, making the ladies sigh. The man behind the desk gulped looking at Aziel.

""Take out a new one and be quick,"" Aziel told him and he nodded wordlessly. He quickly opened the drawers by the side and took out another set of papers. He put them on the table in front of us.

""Wait, let ask her what she wants,"" Mason stated looking at me.

So now they'll ask me what I want?

""The terms are binding, though I wish circumstances allowed for more discussion."" Father spoke.

I clenched my fist by my side, trying to stay strong. I wanted to express my feelings clearly and take control of my own life.

""The witnesses have to sign first."" The man told Aziel.

Aziel turned around and nodded at the two guys, who came with him. They walked forward and each one at a time signed onto the paper. Leo left my side and went to sign too.

""Now you both sign,""

Aziel signed the paper in seconds, his face blank, his fingers wrapped around the pen tightly. He drops the pen and back away, putting his hand in his pant's pocket.

""Your turn Catalaiya,"" Father spoke.

His voice was firm and steady.

I took the pen and signed it. It wasn't the most elegant signature, but it was done. I carefully placed the pen back on the table before stepping back near Leo.

""Now the ring,""

One of Aziel's friends took out a blue velvet box, handing it to him. Aziel opened it before walking toward me. A few long strides and he was in front of me. He grabbed my hand, swiftly put the ring on my finger before dropping my hand.

Mother walked to me with another velvet box and I grabbed the ring. I held the ring in the air and looked up at him. He lift his hand and I put the ring on his finger.

It was a little tight as the ring size were of Mason.

""This union is now formalized,"" the man said, his words met with our tense silence. He gulped, looking down.

""That is nonsense."" Mason scoffed looking at the wall.

""This is quite unfortunate."" Mason's father stated. They all left, including the man behind the desk.

Aziel and the two guys walked out, leaving me, Leo, my father and my mother inside.

""Come here, my little daughter."" Father opened his arm, with a small smile on his face.

I ignored him and turned around to hug Leo tightly. He wrapped his arm around me, rubbing my back slowly.

""We should walk out, Aziel is waiting,"" Leo murmured.

We pulled away and he gave me a reassuring smile.

""If you need anything, call me."" He said and I nodded. I wrapped my arm around his and we both made our way outside. I didn't care if my parents were following us or not. Once we were near Aziel's car, Leo handed me my phone which he kept in his pocket since my dress didn't have one and I didn't bring a purse.

Aziel sat in the front while I sat in the back with one of his friends. There was a good amount of space between us as I leaned against the door, looking outside.

The car started to move and I waved at Leo. He smiled and waved back. Soon, I lost sight of him.

""Drop us at my place,"" Aziel told his friend.

Aziel's pov:

I put the last file in the drawer before closing it. There was a knock on my door and I said a loud 'come in'.

A familiar guy walked in but I couldn't remember where I saw him. He sat down in front of me.

""Yes?"" I asked.

""I'm Leo Snyder from Snyder company. My father came to you for a work a few months ago."" He says and by his surname, I knew who it was.

His father prioritized financial gain above all else.

""I already did his work,"" I stated.

""I know but you didn't take your money as per the contract."" He replies.

If I remember clearly, there was no money involved. The contract clearly says that he will give me his daughter as my wife when I'm done with his work. I honestly didn't want to sign this contract as I didn't want to get married but my father forced me. He was present in the office when Leo's father came to see me.

""It isn't important,"" I said briefly.

""We both know the 'money' is my sister Catalaiya."" He said firmly.

Something tells me there's more to this.

""What do you want?""

""That you keep your word."" He simply added.

""You want me to marry your sister out of a contract,"" I said and he nodded.

""Failing to honor this agreement would be... uncharacteristic for a man of your standing."" He says.

I chuckled humourlessly,""You think it's wise to test my resolve, in his own office.""

""My associates are aware of this meeting and will follow up if necessary."" He spoke confidently.

I clenched my jaw, glaring at him.

**Chapter**3

Aziel's pov:

Few days ago before the wedding part 2

The door slammed opened and I looked up at Adam, my elder brother. He looked confused and concerned while I looked pissed.

""What the heck, dude? Carter told me what happened earlier."" He said as he sat in front of me. Carter was my best friend and business partner. A few minutes later when Leo left, I called Carter and told him everything... cause if I didn't, my office would be completely destroyed by my anger.

""Like always your father's idea wins,"" I said sarcastically. I'm not really close to our father and each time I talked, I always say 'his father'.

He sighed leaning in his seat.

""I thought you would get away from this... like it's been weeks since you did their work."" He spoke.

Just like me, father forced Adam to marry a woman who was one of his friend's daughters. Her name's Alicia and she was mean to Adam. My brother's bfinancial priorities differed significantly.

""Carter uncovered discrepancies in their motives,"" I said gaining his attention.

""The union appeared to be more a result of external pressures than a reflection of mutual consent."" I explained.

He furrowed his eyebrows, ""So his brother came to you because of the money status.""

I shrugged,"" I think so. His father is known for his greed for money, it wouldn't be a surprise that his son and daughter are just like him.""

""You suspect her compliance stems from pragmatism."" he concluded and I nodded.

""There's no other reason. Why would a brother come to a mafia leader, tell him to marry his dear sister out of a contract?"" I inquired.

""You're right,"" he nodded, ""What will you do now?""

""I'll do the wedding to show him that I do keep my words. Besides, I don't need to commit to a contract-based wedding; it'll just be an arrangement."" I stated.

Leo's pov:

I reached home and closed the door, letting a breath of relief. I made sure that no one was following me home.

""How did it go?""

I turned around and saw my lovely wife, Kassy, with my adorable girl, Aria, in her arms. My lips curled in a smile, feeling better now that I've seen them. I walked to them and pulled my wife into my arms before kissing my daughter's cheeks.

""I hope it works,"" I murmured.

Kassy frowned, ""You should tell Catalaiya.""

I shook my head no, ""She's already upset about what's happening, if I tell her this news, she'll be in shock.""

""She needs to know though,"" Kassy insisted.

A few days ago, I learned that Mason was planning to marry my sister just to get her million worth properties. He already made the papers and it was accidentally sent to our office. That's how I learned about it and when I read the property paper, it was mentioned that the rightful owner-Catalaiya-was dead due to an 'unexplainable' reason.

That got me thinking and I did a lot of research on Mason. I knew talking with my parents would be a complete waste of time, as they were the ones who chose this scoundrel for her.

When doing all the research, I got hold of Aziel Alvaro's file and the contract he signed with father. This was the only way, to stop Mason from killing my sister. It was the only way to protect her.

I didn't mean to threaten Aziel, I don't have the guts to do that. I know his powers and what he can do. I love my family and I wouldn't want any harm to come upon them.

""I'll tell her a few days after the wedding... hopefully Aziel come to the rescue."" I sighed.

Aria cooed and I smiled at her. I picked her up in my arms and pampered her with kisses. She smiled widely showing her pink gum.

Aziel's pov:

Wedding day in the car\*

Carter drove us to my house. I sat in the front because I didn't want to sit beside her. Instead, Adam sat beside her. I glanced at her through the front mirror and she was looking outside, lost in her thoughts.

I had no way to gauge her intentions—this marriage was as much a mystery to me as to her.

We reached the big gate and the guard nodded at me before opening it. Once it opened, Carter drove right to the front area and parked. I unbuckled my seatbelt, opening the door.

I glanced at her and she was standing near the door, taking in the estate's grandeur with wide eyes.

Of course she will be awed.

The front of my house was kinda plain and dull to see, but at the back, it was more gorgeous and luxurious. The front of the house hides all the charm of the back, always surprising newcomers.

I love this place so much...

I walked to the front porch and opened the door. She tagged along, taking in the architectural details with quiet fascination. Adam and Carter stayed near the car as I have to go back to work for the influential circles. I had to postpone a meeting for this wedding and I'm already 15 minutes late.

I'm always on time...

""Thalia,"" I called out loudly.

Thalia was my maid and she lives here, in the guest house with her husband Alfred, who was one of my drivers. They both had been working for me for the last 6 years. I was 20 years old when I bought this house and now I'm 26 years old.

Thalia was in her forties while Alfred was in his fifties.

Thalia walked toward us and looked at Catalaiya with wide eyes.

""We're married. She'll be staying here now."" I informed Thalia and she nodded.

""Show her around and take care of her. I need to go back to work."" I stated.

**Chapter**4

Catalaiya's pov:

This house was enormously huge and so pretty. I try to keep my stunned expression in as I looked around.

Aziel left the house while I stood in the same spot, awkwardly.

""Hi, I'm Thalia. I'm the maid here."" She introduced herself. Thalia was the same height as me, she had short dirty blonde hair, rosy cheeks, dark brown eyes and she has really pale skin.

""Hi, I'm Catalaiya... the new bride."" I awkwardly said the last part as I didn't know what else to say and she just smiled at me, not judging.

""Well welcome home, you look pretty in your dress."" She complimented me.

It was the first compliment that I got since this morning.

""Thank you,"" I said sincerely.

She walked behind me and closed the door before turning toward me again.

""None of your stuff arrived yet and I doubt you want to stay in this dress... how about I lend you one of mine and then I'll show you around?"" She suggested.

""Yes,"" I nodded.

""Sit down or walk around, I'll be back soon."" She smiled as she dashed to the end of the room toward the door which I think lead outside.

She lives in the back?

I looked around at my new surroundings. I took a step forward before I stopped. The floor was shining, showing how clean it was so I lift the front of my dress and removed my heels, grabbing them by their straps.

I walked to the open glass door behind the couch and I was surprised to see the set-up of his pool. There was another set of couches outside, palm trees, a firepit area, a patio area. I didn't walk outside as I waited for Thalia. I sat on the couch which was comfy.

I heard the door open, ""I'm back.""

I looked at her and she walked to me with a pink dress.

""I think this will fit you."" She says as she handed me the dress.

""Thank you,"" I said again.

""Come, I'll show you the master bedroom.""

I follow her to the stairs which were on the side of the living room. I hold onto the rail as I was afraid I would step on the front of my dress and fall. Once upstairs, there was another living room in the middle.

On either side, there was a door leading in a hallway. She turned to the right side and I followed her. This hallway leads directly to one door. She opened it and stepped inside.

""It's pretty,"" I commented.

She chuckled, ""Aziel has a great choice.""

She walked to another door near the window and she opened it, ""here's the bathroom. You can change here while I'll make something for you to drink. What would you like, Coffee, tea, milkshake, juice?""

""Juice will be good,"" I replied and she nodded.

As she walked out of the room, I dropped the dress on the bed and my heels near the wooden sitting area. I walked near the window and slightly pull the curtain to the side to look outside. The view was the front entrance. I let go of the curtain before looking around.

There was another door that lead to the closet. His closet was behind the wall of his bed. I walked in and I was amazed by the number of suits he has. Once I was done looking around, I grabbed the dress and changed.

It felt good to be out of the wedding dress.

Since I didn't have any shoes or sandals to wear, I had to wear my heels. I grabbed the wedding dress and laid it on the small couch. I then made my way downstairs to the kitchen where Thalia was.

I stood by the counter and she handed me a glass of juice, ""Fresh orange juice for you.""

""Thank you,""

I took a sip and the cold liquid felt refreshing.

""Follow me, I'll show you around.""

She walked in front of me and I followed her.

""There are two guest rooms here, that we barely use.""

She walked to the last room, which was closer to the back door she used earlier. She opened it and stepped aside so that I could see the inside.

""It's a small library,"" she spoke as my eyes roamed around. Drat, this room was more colorful than the other rooms.

""Who usually reads here?"" I asked curiously.

""No one... I only read a few books in my free time in my guest house, but never in here. Maybe, you will use this room more than us."" She says making me look at her.

Maybe...

""Do you wanna see my guest house?"" She asked and I nodded. We walked out of the room and she opened the back door. We walked on the green grass, to a guest house. She slides open the front door and made her way inside.

""Alfred, we have a visitor."" She says loudly before grabbing my hand. She excitedly pulled me into her living room and at the same time, Alfred walked in from their bedroom.

""Oh, who is this lovely lady?"" He gave me a warm smile.

""I'm Catalaiya, nice to meet you."" I introduced myself.

""She is Aziel's wife,"" Thalia added making Alfred's eye widen.

""And he's my husband Alfred. He's also one of Aziel's drivers."" Thalia told me.

Oh...

""Aziel got married?"" Alfred asked, not believing Thalia.

""Yes,""

""Well welcome,"" he smiled and I smiled back.

These two were nice and welcoming. I feel less miserable and sad now as I know there were two people here who I can talk to.

We stayed in the guest house for a few minutes talking before we walked back to the main house. Thalia cooked and we had dinner together. For some reason, I felt really tired. So one hour later, I was on the bed ready to sleep.",1,1748910878.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

NEW GROUPS
-🟨 Azucar Internacional
A Colombian, agri-business that harvest sugar, tobacco, coffee and rice. They wear yellow, short sleeved dress shirts with floral or plain print. They wear gold chains and watches. There base would be a 1 story build with plants growing, tables with computers, and mostly lounge areas.

-🟥 HongShi Holdings
A Chinese business that specializes in the leasing and management of cultural artifacts and sites. They wear red suits with a golden dragon head on the shoulders. Their base would have artifacts inside, abide by feng shui and have maybe one or two cubicles.

-🟪 Kanzor
They are a Russian Mafia that buy, sell, acquire and delete certain data. They wear dark purple suits with black gloves and their hat is an Ushanka with the ear flaps folded up. Kanzor’s base would be very compact with many servers and computers with wires running along the ground. They would also have a radio room next to the spawn room on the second floor.


NEW MAP
maybe idk cause the current map can maybe take 1 more corp.


WEAPONS
idk about guns but maybe melee weapons specific to the corps, like a katana for Yoromoto, Hook swords for HongShi, Bats for Renetti, Knuckledusters for Azucar and Daggers for Kanzor. Idk about the American groups Tomohawk for Alamont and idk about halfwell.
They could also add C4 or NPCs


NEW GAMEMODES
Data Swap: all companies have a project, but different ones have different values to other companies.
(maybe add a fake projects)

Business Buy: we can incorporate the different spots, like Aloha Burger, Red Eye Diner and Dealership, so that companies can buy the businesses to make them more money down the line ( this one will usually take place Monday or Tuesday)

Protect The Boss: One Companies Boss is in town, He will spawn at a random food, or club spot in town and only the Bosses corporation know where he is. It is their job to take him home while it is the other corps job to kill the boss. The Boss also spawns with 3 goons and their own car. The goons will be npcs with decent aim and 2 will have hand balls and one with a pitch. The corp that knows where the boss is needs to go to the spot, interact with the boss then the boss will tail them home in their car. If there is no car they will follow them on foot. The opposing teams have a bounty on the boss, and will gain a good amount of money when killing the boss. But the money only ever goes to one team, who ever puts the last bullet in the boss’ head.",2,1748910649.0,RobloxNoBigDeal,0,1.0,False
1l1yc5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/comments/1l1yc5m/has_anyone_been_able_to_manage_low_blood_pressure/,Has anyone been able to manage low blood pressure without making their dystonia/movement disorders worse?,"I tend to have borderline hypotension in general, postprandial hypotension, and learned in December (with tilt table test) delayed orthostatic hypotension. 

I already drink tons of water and started incorporating more salt in my diet when a PT last year made note of my vitals saying it would be unsafe to work with me until I take meds to raise my BP and lower HR. And with the recommended vitals diary, I learned that there was a reason I can’t function without coffee in the morning XD, it actually does help temporarily raise it.

So in response to the TTT my neurologist prescribed Pyridostigmine, so my BP would only raise while standing. However among other side effects, was an increase in violent full body spastic attacks.

Several months later, I went to the cardiologist who did the test who said I needed to take Midodrine instead, 1 gram salt tablet x3 a day and weekly IVs (saline drip I believe), I very much pleaded against the last one as I very much do not like IVs and he said ok for now if the meds and salt works. Well I actually find the Midodrine much more distressing with the effects to my neck and throat, and increased difficulty lifting my head. (I only took a low dose for only 4-5 days).  

Only one salt tablet with lunch seems to cause immediate stomach upset, so I have not been taking the full 3 times day.

(Also I only eat a medium lunch and a meal right before bed as frequent small/healthy/low carb meals make me really sick and learned a few months ago from Endocrinologist/continuous glucose monitor that it’s because that makes me constantly hypoglycemic rather than fasting or medium/large meals).

It’s frustrating because some things that are meant to help one condition makes another worse. 

So I was curious if anyone here has low blood pressure and have found something that actually helps without making dystonia and other movement disorders worse. Even if it is the IVs. Thanks in advance and I apologize for the lengthy post! I see my neurologist in a couple of weeks so it would be great to share if anyone else had success and come up with a better game plan with him. :)

Need 60 participants minimum. The University gave me $150 funding, allowing me to pay 30 people $5 each.

My initial plan was to save this money for strangers signing up to the study for the money, and then get the other 30 to do it for free through friends/connections etc. The study isn't long, takes 30 mins max to participate so not much a commitment, so I thought it was doable.

But then, on Wednesday night, I started to feel extremely fucking guilty at 2AM because I was paying some people but not others and I honestly felt so scummy for it, even though I literally couldn't afford to do it any other way. I was having 6 of my friends do it on the Thursday, none of which I was planning to pay with the funding because they all told me they were happy to do it for free and I need as many free participants as I can get.

...I caved to my guilt/empathy and paid them all anyway.

Now i'm in a position where I somehow need to find 6 entirely new participants willing to do it for free (Which I was already struggling with - I don't have anywhere near 30 close friends here lol). I will probably have to end up just paying $30 out of my own pocket to convince those 6 more people.

I've since realized my mistake and how my empathy/guilt made me do something irrational, and going forward I have since been more transparent with people. I've basically been saying ""Hey I didn't get enough funding to pay everyone so I can't pay you as I need to save the money to incentivise strangers but I'd love to repay you by buying a coffee or something etc"" and I really should've just used this approach from the start because every friend I've sent this to so far has been fully accepting and happy to do it for free with no compensation. I felt so scummy not being transparent with them by not telling them some people are getting paid while they aren't, without explaining. I got so stuck in my own head about not wanting to make people feel cheated or left out that I'm now gonna have to spend my own money to recover from this.

And it's just... I feel so much agony over this. I think the worst part about it for me is that I probably haven't even made these 6 friends feel good. Sure they all took the $5 for taking part, but I doubt they felt good about taking it. They might even feel the need to repay \*me\* now which actually makes them feel worse. I wanted to do an act of kindness for them and make them feel good but now I'm sat here worrying that my act of kindness actually made them feel guilty or uncomfortable for taking the money. This could've all just been avoided by being transparent with them and explaining the situation but I didn't and now this has happened.

I know it's not the end of the world, and I can easily bounce back from this and make it to 60 people, even if it now means using some of my own money. I just wanted to write about this because it was strange to me how I let my guilt/empathy control me like that, and how I'm now getting thoughts/worries that giving my friends money could've actually made them feel worse about the whole thing.

""Hmm..."" Sadie Hudson murmured in a gentle whisper, her eyes fluttering open into a drowsy blur, only to be met with the intense gaze of another pair of eyes.  
  
Her husband, Noah Wall, had quietly returned, his presence subtly marked by the faint aroma of alcohol.  
  
He sealed their reunion with a kiss that was unyieldingly dominant, compelling her into a reluctant acquiescence.  
  
A wave of unease surged through Sadie's chest, and reflexively, she attempted to withdraw.  
  
""Stay still."" Noah's voice rumbled, deep and seductive, tinged with a compelling charm that was hard to resist.  
  
For a moment, Sadie's body tensed, caught in a struggle between resistance and submission.  
  
Today was significant--their second anniversary--and she was determined not to spoil the celebratory spirit.  
  
With a sigh, she closed her eyes, allowing herself to melt into his embrace.  
  
The robust scent of his cologne masked the alcohol, swirling around her and piercing her heart with its potent allure.  
  
Noah's eyes darkened with desire as he observed her yielding, his actions becoming bolder and less restrained.  
  
Just as Sadie was about to regain her composure, she gasped softly, her plea laced with a tender fragility. ""Please, not too harsh... because I...""  
  
She couldn't complete her revelation of being pregnant. The sharp ring of a phone sliced through the thick tension, abruptly severing the intimate moment between them.  
  
Noah's eyes, still ablaze with longing, flickered as he caught sight of the caller ID.  
  
He got up and began to dress, his movements betraying none of the fervor that had engulfed him just moments before.  
  
""Are you heading out?"" Sadie inquired, her voice tinged with a mix of confusion and concern as she tightened the grip on her nightgown.  
  
""Yeah,"" Noah answered, his tone breezy and dismissive, as if evading further inquiry.  
  
""But...""  
  
""Go back to sleep,"" he interjected smoothly, his voice soft yet detached. He leaned forward, his lips briefly caressing her forehead in a fleeting, tender gesture.  
  
Without a single backward glance, he strode out of the room.  
  
Sadie's eyes lingered on the empty doorway, her heart sinking slowly.  
  
She convinced herself it had to be an emergency at work.  
  
Understanding was essential; any sign of displeasure could drive him further away.  
  
After all, she had loved Noah for over a decade, and becoming his wife was a dream realized. She could hardly expect more.  
  
With a sigh, Sadie quickly freshened up and returned to bed, her hand resting gently on her belly, a hopeful smile playing at the corners of her mouth.  
  
""Sweetheart, Daddy didn't mean to leave us by ourselves. Please, don't hold it against him, alright?""  
  
No sooner had she uttered these words than her phone buzzed with an unexpected news alert, startling her.  
  
""Wall Group CEO Spotted at the Airport Late at Night, Allegedly Picking up Mysterious Girlfriend.""  
  
The photo that accompanied the headline captured Noah at the airport's private terminal entrance, clad in a black suit. He stood with impeccable posture, exuding an undeniable aura of authority.  
  
His eyes conveyed a softness, a tender warmth that Sadie had never observed before.  
  
Shock flashed across Sadie's face as her heart thudded painfully in her chest, the sharp sensation nearly stealing her breath.  
  
It took a considerable effort for her to regain her composure. Clutching onto a sliver of hope, she clicked on the article, her fingers quivering.  
  
As she had feared, a familiar face filled the screen--Kyla Wade.  
  
The woman Noah had seemingly been unable to forget was evidently back in his life.  
  
A chill spread through Sadie, a profound sorrow embedding itself deep within her heart.  
  
She clenched her teeth, forcefully suppressing her cries.  
  
The memory of how her marriage had begun was too painful to revisit.  
  
Two years earlier, just as Kyla and Noah had been planning their future together, Kyla had vanished without a trace.  
  
At that critical juncture, with Noah poised to secure the position of chairman of the board and in dire need of a compliant wife, Sadie, known for her unwavering devotion to him and from a family now in decline, had become the ideal candidate.  
  
For the past two years, Sadie had been a docile wife, enveloped in a sense of unworthiness, as if the joy she experienced was never truly meant for her.  
  
That illusion shattered yesterday when she discovered she was pregnant.  
  
They had always been meticulous in preventing pregnancy, except for that one night last month. Noah had staggered home, reeking of alcohol after a business dinner, and in his drunken haze, they had lost themselves to passion.  
  
That fleeting lapse had now culminated in her pregnancy.  
  
Now, Sadie was tormented by uncertainty on how to break the news to Noah.  
  
She dreaded that Noah would demand an abortion.  
  
Deep down, she knew she wasn't the woman he loved.  
  
When Sadie was still engulfed in a whirlpool of anxious thoughts, her reverie was broken by Noah's voice echoing from the study.  
  
Was he already home?  
  
She rose, pulling a light coat around her shoulders, and made her way to the study.  
  
Just as she neared the door, the playful tones of Alex Howe, Noah's friend, reached her ears. ""Did you really spend the entire night with Kyla?""  
  
Sadie felt her heart plummet.  
  
So it was true. Noah had spent the night with Kyla.  
  
""Mm-hmm,"" Noah responded, his voice empty of any discernible emotion.  
  
""What's your take on Sadie, then? After two years as husband and wife, you can't possibly say she means nothing to you, can you?"" Alex's voice softened with concern. ""She's truly remarkable, you know. If you fail to see her worth, someone else surely will, and you'll be left with nothing but regret.""  
  
""I only feel a faint stir of guilt,"" Noah retorted, his voice cold and distant, as if discussing something trivial. ""If you're so taken with her, perhaps I should do the matchmaking. But really, shouldn't you be getting back to work? Off you go.""  
  
Guilt? Was that the only thing Noah felt towards her? As this stark realization dawned on Sadie, a solitary tear traced a silent path down her cheek. Her hand fell away from the doorknob, trembling.  
  
It was painfully clear--he had never truly loved her.  
  
In the recesses of Noah's heart, she was just an insignificant trifle he could easily hand off to another.  
  
A shiver of desolation coursed through her.  
  
With a swift turn, Sadie darted into the sanctuary of the garden, her heart pounding wildly.  
  
There, she huddled down, burying her face in her knees, her tears distorting the world around her.  
  
Memories flooded back--the day she first met Noah, ten years ago.  
  
He had been the epitome of charm and vitality, born of privilege, effortlessly stealing the hearts of every girl at school.  
  
And Sadie, newly vulnerable from her family's downfall, had been easy prey for ridicule.  
  
It was Noah who had stepped in like a guardian, his words like shields, commanding others to back down.  
  
In those moments, he had been her savior, her angel.  
  
  
Chapter 2 You'd Have To End The Pregnancy  
It was at that time that Sadie fell hopelessly in love with Noah.  
  
In the days following his departure to study abroad, she immersed herself completely in her studies, eventually earning a place at his university.  
  
She harbored the belief that excellence could bridge the gap between them.  
  
Finally, one day, he approached her and proposed marriage.  
  
She believed her affections had thawed his indifference.  
  
However, she was mistaken.  
  
Noah's heart had always belonged to Kyla.  
  
To him, she was nothing more than a stand-in.  
  
Taking a deep breath, Sadie fought to control the whirlwind of emotions threatening to overwhelm her.  
  
Pregnant and under doctor's orders to maintain her composure, she knew she had to be strong for her unborn child.  
  
Brushing away her tears, she rose and made her way back to the bedroom.  
  
Unprepared for Noah's lack of empathy, she was met with his blunt announcement as soon as he entered the room. ""Kyla is back,"" he declared. ""I think it's time we got a divorce.""  
  
The word ""divorce"" struck Sadie with the force of a physical blow, robbing her of breath.  
  
Until he uttered it, she had clung to a sliver of hope, however frail.  
  
It took Sadie a painfully long time to muster the courage to speak.  
  
""You're leaving me now that she's returned?"" Her voice quivered, betraying her attempt to mask her vulnerability.  
  
Noah's brow furrowed as he regarded her with evident displeasure.  
  
""I was clear from the start when we married--don't long for what can never be truly yours. Anything you desire, I'll ensure you're compensated.""  
  
Those harsh words had been his vow on their wedding night, a night meant only to quell the relentless whispers of the corporate board.  
  
His heart had never been hers to claim.  
  
Driven by a fool's hope, Sadie had thrown herself at him, believing she could stir some emotion in him.  
  
Sadie raised her eyes to Noah's, a silent plea for truth in her gaze.  
  
""All those nights we shared… were you imagining I was Kyla?""  
  
Noah was caught off guard by her blunt question. He hesitated, his mouth opening slightly, but no words came.  
  
Sadie interpreted his silence as the stark admission she had feared, and it shattered her already fragile heart.  
  
Deep down, she had always understood that Noah's heart was not in their union.  
  
Yet, the fleeting moments of happiness during their intimate nights had momentarily blinded her to this brutal reality.  
  
She had mistaken their physical closeness for emotional acceptance.  
  
But she had been tragically mistaken.  
  
Throughout their entire tumultuous entanglement, Noah's heart had remained elusive to her.  
  
With a profound sigh, Sadie closed her eyes and resigned herself to her fate.  
  
""Fine, I consent to the divorce,"" she declared resignedly.  
  
Turning on her heel, she collected a few personal belongings, deciding to spend the night in the guest room.  
  
Noah's gaze lingered on her, his forehead creasing in frustration, a subtle annoyance brewing within him.  
  
As Sadie brushed past him, Noah reached out instinctively, clasping her hand, poised to say something.  
  
Yet, just as he opened his mouth, Kyla's call interrupted him.  
  
Reluctantly, Noah let go of Sadie's hand to answer, and Sadie made her way to the guest room.  
  
""Hello, Kyla... It's nothing, really...""  
  
Sadie couldn't hear the rest of Noah's words.  
  
All she could discern was the unexpected softness in Noah's voice, a stark contrast to the coldness he reserved for her.  
  
She shut the door of the guest room, threw herself onto the bed, and clamped a hand over her mouth to muffle her cries.  
  
Even as she grappled with the harsh reality of their impending divorce, the stinging disparity between Noah's indifference to her and his warmth towards Kyla pierced her heart deeply.  
  
What was she to do now? And what of their unborn child?  
  
Sadie was completely at a loss.  
  
All she knew was that she felt exhausted, hurt, and desperate to flee from everything.  
  
The sound of cascading water filled the bathroom as Sadie absentmindedly shed her clothes and stepped into the shower.  
  
Although the warm water cascaded over her, it did nothing to thaw the cold grip of sadness clutching her heart.  
  
She sank down, curling into herself and burying her face against her knees. The relentless roar of the shower muffled her sobs as she finally let go, tears streaming down uncontrollably.  
  
Why? Why did he have to be so cruel?  
  
Exhausted from crying, she stood up and got dressed, but suddenly, her foot slipped on the slick surface.  
  
""Ah!""  
  
A jolt of sharp pain surged through her as she couldn't hold back a pained cry. Instinctively, her hands flew to her lower abdomen, cradling the spot where she felt the impact.  
  
In the master bedroom, the sound of Sadie's distress reached Noah. He immediately sprinted towards the source of the noise.  
  
The bathroom door was ajar, and he caught sight of Sadie crumpled on the floor.  
  
Her complexion was ghostly pale, a sheen of cold sweat on her skin, her attire in disarray, and her hands fervently guarding her abdomen--as if she had taken a hit.  
  
A sudden pang of concern tightened Noah's chest.  
  
He hurried to Sadie, quickly scooping her up from the cold, wet floor.  
  
""What happened to you? Are you injured anywhere?""  
  
Noah's voice trembled with a barely detectable undercurrent of panic.  
  
Sadie's mind reeled, her vision blurring slightly as she tried to focus on the man before her. It took her a moment to muster a response through the haze of her confusion.  
  
""I'm fine..."" Her words were barely a whisper.  
  
She attempted to wriggle free from Noah's embrace, but he tightened his grip.  
  
""Stay still,"" Noah commanded, his voice firm, tinged with urgency. Sadie ceased her struggling, subdued by his tone.  
  
He continued with a softer edge, ""Let me make sure you're not hurt.""  
  
Gently, he laid her onto the bed.  
  
Leaning over, Noah meticulously examined her for any injuries, his expression a mix of concern and focus.  
  
This unexpected gentleness rekindled a wavering spark of hope within Sadie.  
  
She seized his hand abruptly, her voice cracking as she posed a question loaded with fear and desperation. ""Noah, what if I were to tell you I'm pregnant? Would you still push for a divorce?""  
  
The possibility of keeping their marriage intact for the sake of a child lingered in the air.  
  
Sadie searched Noah's eyes for any sign of reconsideration.  
  
Noah paused, his face unreadable for a brief moment before he replied coldly, ""We've always been careful. It's unlikely you're pregnant. But even if it were true, the situation wouldn't change--you'd have to end the pregnancy.""  
  
  
Chapter 3 She Was Just His Employee  
Sadie's complexion drained of color, leaving her ghostly pale.  
  
Noah had just delivered his harsh decree for her to end the pregnancy. His indifference was a dagger to her heart.  
  
""Why? Noah, even if you don't want this child, must you be so merciless?"" Sadie's voice trembled, disbelief etching her features.  
  
Noah returned her gaze with icy detachment, his voice a deep, unwavering growl. ""Our marriage is merely a contractual arrangement. A child would only make things messy.""  
  
Crushed, Sadie averted her eyes, the sting of rejection too potent to bear. Internally, her sorrow carved through her, deep and relentless.  
  
After collecting herself, she said, her tone defiant, her resolve firm, ""Well, don't you worry, Noah. I would never burden you with a child!""  
  
Her decision was made: she would keep the baby, but not for him--for herself.  
  
One day, she would tell her child that their father was a part of her past, nothing more.  
  
Noah's brow creased slightly. ""I'm glad you see it that way. You're not feeling great. Take some time to rest. No need to worry about work for now.""  
  
Without another word, he exited Sadie's room, his silhouette disappearing into the hallway.  
  
Despite his words, Sadie appeared at the company the very next day.  
  
The weight of raising a child alone left no room for weakness. No matter how drained she felt, she had to push through--there was no luxury of rest.  
  
She worked at Wall Group. She had joined its secretarial department right out of college to be close to Noah.  
  
Their marriage was a well-kept secret, hidden from the eyes of the oblivious majority, except for Noah's assistant, Samuel Ford, and a select few executives.  
  
As soon as Sadie stepped into the bustling secretarial department, she noticed a crowd huddled in front of the meeting room, buzzing with hushed, eager whispers.  
  
""So that's the woman everyone's been whispering about--Mr. Wall's rumored girlfriend.""  
  
""Rumored? She's practically official, okay? Don't forget she was the reason Mr. Wall spiraled into that slump two years back.""  
  
""Apparently, they've known each other since they were just kids in elementary school.""  
  
""Mr. Wall actually held back during the meeting just now--no scolding at all. Guess his sweetheart was watching.""  
  
""And now, Miss Wade's stepping in as Mr. Wall's private senior legal counsel. Talk about a power couple.""  
  
…  
  
Each whispered word struck Sadie like a sharp, icy dagger, slicing through the facade of her calm demeanor.  
  
The memories of Noah's enduring affection for Kyla, even remembered vividly by the employees, haunted her.  
  
She felt utterly insignificant.  
  
Sadie bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, her nails digging into the flesh of her palms, a physical counter to the emotional pain.  
  
She forced herself to block out the murmurs, to ignore the stabs of jealousy, and to focus on her tasks as if nothing had disrupted the ordinary.  
  
But the words clung to her, a relentless echo in her mind, taunting her with their cruel, magical persistence.  
  
Suddenly, nausea overwhelmed her.  
  
Sadie stood abruptly, her chair scraping back, and hurried to the restroom.  
  
To mask her discomfort, she cranked the faucet to full blast, the sound of rushing water a feeble shield against any curious ears.  
  
It wasn't until after she had vomited nothing but bitter bile that Sadie felt the turmoil inside her subside slightly.  
  
She splashed her face with cold water, each droplet a small shock to her system, helping her piece her composure back together.  
  
With a deep breath, she steadied herself and left the restroom. The door to the meeting room was slightly open as she walked by, just enough for her to see Noah and Kyla sitting side by side.  
  
Kyla tilted her body forward in a pose that spoke of elegance and deliberate grace.  
  
Her voice was soft, almost a whisper, and her eyes glinted with a mix of allure and subtle seduction.  
  
They were so close their shoulders almost touched, casting them in the intimate silhouette of a couple deeply in tune with each other.  
  
Watching from afar, Sadie felt like a forgotten shadow lingering on the edges of their world.  
  
In her own marriage, she had always been the one on the outside, peering in, never truly part of the picture.  
  
Tears welled up quietly, tracing a silent path down her cheeks.  
  
As she turned to leave, her elbow caught a potted plant, sending it crashing to the floor with a clatter that sliced through the quiet.  
  
The sudden noise jerked Noah's attention away from Kyla. His eyes found Sadie's, locking onto her with a mixture of surprise and something colder, harder.  
  
Embarrassed by her own clumsiness and overwhelmed by her feelings, Sadie felt frustrated.  
  
Noah stepped outside, his presence now overwhelming, and Kyla, quick as a flash, appeared beside him.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" Noah's voice was sharp, edged with clear displeasure at the sight of Sadie.  
  
It didn't take long for Kyla to figure out Sadie's identity.  
  
Yet, she pretended not to know, flashing a sugary smile as she asked, ""Noah, who is she?""  
  
And there it was--the question that hung in the air, heavy and oppressive.  
  
Who was she?  
  
Sadie's heart ached to know just where she stood in Noah's life.  
  
The disdain in her expression was evident, and Noah's features tightened, a flicker of displeasure crossing his face. He responded curtly, ""She's just an employee.""  
  
Just an employee?  
  
The phrase echoed mockingly in Sadie's ears, amplifying her sense of insignificance.  
  
She felt reduced to nothing--a mere shadow within the cold, unyielding walls of their workplace.  
  
No sooner had Noah finished speaking than he turned around and strode away.  
  
Kyla paused to shoot Sadie a smug, provocative glance, her eyes gleaming with triumph, before she hurried after Noah.  
  
Left alone, Sadie felt adrift, as if standing in the midst of a strange, unfathomable world.  
  
Lost in a haze for the rest of the workday, Sadie was jolted back to reality by an unexpected call from her grandmother, Laura Stewart.  
  
""Sadie, I'm not getting any younger, and who knows how much time I have left. More than anything, I dream of the day you're settled, with a loving spouse and children by your side. So, when are you finally bringing your boyfriend to meet me?""  
  
As Laura spoke with warmth and ease, Sadie found herself swallowing hard, emotion creeping up on her.  
  
Even Laura, the one who had always been there for her, was completely unaware that she was married.  
  
Noah had set the terms before their wedding--beyond the board of directors, it was best to keep their marriage under wraps.  
  
He surely anticipated Kyla's return, didn't he?  
  
Every step of the way, he had been silently working to make things easier for Kyla.  
  
The moment she hung up was a blur, but one thing stuck--her promise to Laura that she'd bring her boyfriend home this Saturday.  
  
But just who was she supposed to show up with?  
  
  
Chapter 4 Acting Pitiful?  
Sadie's mind was in chaos as she hastily collected her things and exited the office.  
  
As she stood on the curb, her eyes searching the street, a sleek Maybach slid to a stop before her.  
  
The window descended slowly, unveiling the striking features of a man whose appearance never failed to draw admiring gasps from onlookers.  
  
It was none other than Noah.  
  
""Get in,"" he called out, his voice smooth and authoritative.  
  
Despite her urge to decline, the memory of Laura's unsettling phone call earlier made Sadie step into the car with resignation.  
  
This time, she deliberately chose the back seat instead of the front.  
  
""I told you I'd compensate you, but don't think acting pitiful will make me feel sorry for you,"" Noah remarked, a hint of reproach in his tone.  
  
Acting pitiful?  
  
The irony of his words struck Sadie, and a laugh, sharp and devoid of any real amusement, escaped her.  
  
""When are we getting divorced?"" she asked, her voice tinged with a brittle, hollow quality.  
  
Noah, puzzled by her laughter, replied, ""Relax, there's no need to rush--it's not the right time.""  
  
""And where are we going now?"" Sadie pressed, her frustration mounting.  
  
""We're heading back to the family estate--Grandpa wants to see you,"" Noah explained, his voice softening.  
  
Noah's grandfather, Nigel Wall, stood as a pillar of warmth in Sadie's chaotic life, second only to Laura.  
  
Since her family's financial collapse in middle school and the mysterious disappearance of her parents, kindness had been a rare luxury in Sadie's life.  
  
Noah's presence had once brightened her entire existence.  
  
Now, everything seemed to be reverting to a gray, mundane reality.  
  
Sadie remained silent, her quietness an implicit nod of agreement.  
  
After a long pause, her voice, barely above a whisper, broke the silence. ""One month.""  
  
""What?"" Noah's confusion was palpable.  
  
""I want the divorce finalized within a month,"" she declared, her tone resolute yet tinged with a hidden urgency.  
  
If the proceedings dragged on, Noah might uncover her secret--she was pregnant.  
  
Given his attachment to Kyla, he would undoubtedly demand she end the pregnancy, and she was determined not to forsake her unborn child.  
  
Noah's brow creased in annoyance. ""The decision's been made, Sadie. Stop playing these mind games with me,"" he said, his voice laced with frustration.  
  
He knew all too well how deeply she cared for him, which always left him wrestling with a sense of guilt.  
  
However, he was adamant that her feelings couldn't be used as leverage in their strained negotiations.  
  
With a stern tone, he added, ""Until the divorce is official, we need to keep up appearances. Let's not give anything away.""  
  
Sadie felt a sharp sting in her eyes at his harsh words.  
  
""Noah, you really have a heart of stone when it comes to me,"" she murmured, her voice breaking.  
  
She slightly lowered the car window, turned her head to gaze out, and let the brisk wind dry her tears.  
  
Their car wound its way toward the Wall Manor, located in a lush, prestigious hill in Buihron, a mere half-hour drive from the bustling city center.  
  
The car leisurely pulled into the yard, marking their arrival with a gentle halt.  
  
Noah swung the car door open for Sadie, gracefully shielding her head with his broad palm, a gesture brimming with consideration.  
  
Despite her knowledge of his theatrical display, Sadie found herself momentarily captivated by his charm.  
  
As they strode forward, Noah's warm grip enclosed her hand.  
  
Sadie hesitated, her fingers twitching as she attempted a subtle escape from his clasp.  
  
Unprepared for her sudden resistance, Noah stumbled slightly, turning to face her with a bewildered expression.  
  
In that unexpected moment, as Sadie looked up to meet his gaze, their lips brushed softly against each other.  
  
A shiver of surprise raced through Sadie, her eyes reflecting an astonished sparkle.  
  
""Noah..."" she whispered, her voice trailing off as she stepped back.  
  
Her retreat was cut short by the sudden appearance of Nigel emerging from the grand house.  
  
Caught off guard, Sadie allowed Noah to reclaim her hand as Nigel tapped his cane with feigned annoyance.  
  
""Well, well, look who finally showed up! I was starting to think you'd forgotten me."" His voice carried a playful rebuke.  
  
Under usual circumstances, Sadie would have stepped forward to appease him.  
  
However, today she stood frozen, uncertain of the role she was supposed to play before Nigel.  
  
His keen eyes, seasoned by years in the business world, didn't miss the tension between the young couple.  
  
""Noah's being ridiculous, putting you through unnecessary stress,"" Nigel stated, his gaze softening with empathy towards Sadie while shooting a disapproving glare at Noah.  
  
Noah, lips pressed in a thin line, remained silent, soaking in the weight of Nigel's words.  
  
""I'm fine, Nigel,"" Sadie murmured, her lips curving into a strained smile that failed to reach her eyes, which shimmered with unspoken loneliness.  
  
She was aware of Nigel's genuine concern for her, yet she knew his affection couldn't alter her situation.  
  
""Still claiming you're fine?"" Nigel's voice was gentle, laced with worry as he took Sadie's hand in his. ""You look pale. Come, let's have a chess match. It's been far too long since our last one.""  
  
With a hesitant nod, Sadie allowed herself to be led into the grandeur of the house.  
  
From a distance, Noah observed them, his brow creased with a mixture of confusion and concern.  
  
Although he had mentally prepared himself for the divorce from Sadie, the sight of her finding solace in Nigel's company stirred an unexpected pang of regret in his heart.  
  
As Sadie stepped into the living room, her gaze fell upon Kyla. Poised and elegant, Kyla sat on the sofa, a coffee cup in hand, laughing merrily with Noah's mother, Isabel Wall.  
  
Kyla's eyes widened in feigned surprise when she noticed Sadie. ""Hello, you're one of Noah's employees, right?""  
  
Isabel chimed in with a venomous tone, barely disguising her disdain, ""Is that how Noah introduced her? Looking at the mess she is, it's clear why he doesn't want to admit to their relationship."" She then turned to Kyla, patting her hand with approval. ""Fortunately, you're back, Kyla.""  
  
Kyla cast an apologetic glance at Isabel. ""I'm sorry, Isabel. Leaving for my studies abroad was a mistake. If I hadn't, you and Noah wouldn't have had to worry all this time.""  
  
Isabel huffed dismissively. ""Well, it's a relief you're back now. Some people who've overstayed their welcome will finally have to step aside.""  
  
  
Chapter 5 Causing Trouble  
""Enough already!"" Nigel snapped, his glare slicing through the tension as he stared Isabel down, silencing her instantly.  
  
Sadie and Isabel had never gotten along.  
  
Isabel, always looking down her nose at Sadie, considered her as nothing more than a bankrupt heiress trying to claw her way into the Wall family's vast fortune.  
  
In the past, Sadie had to navigate these treacherous waters with grace, swallowing her pride even when she felt deeply aggrieved.  
  
But now, with divorce proceedings looming on the horizon, she no longer felt compelled to humble herself before Isabel.  
  
Brushing off the chilly atmosphere, Sadie strode confidently across the room to where Nigel sat, taking a seat beside him.  
  
At that moment, Noah pushed the door open and stepped inside.  
  
The moment he walked in, Kyla sprang up and approached him, looping her arm around his.  
  
""Noah, you're finally back,"" she cooed, her voice dripping with the honeyed tones of a wife who had awaited her husband's return for long.  
  
Noah's reaction was swift and cool. He slipped his arm away, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked, his tone icy.  
  
Before Kyla could muster a reply, Isabel interjected smoothly, ""She's here because I invited her. It's been too long since her last visit, so I thought we'd catch up.""  
  
Two years earlier, Isabel had fallen victim to a disastrous investment scam, losing a substantial sum. It was Kyla who had stepped in to untangle the mess, a deed that had quietly solidified her status in Isabel's eyes as the preferred daughter-in-law.  
  
Kyla cast a sorrowful glance at Sadie, her voice trembling slightly. ""Maybe I shouldn't have come. It might be best if I leave now. I don't want to cause any trouble for you, Noah.""  
  
She turned dramatically towards the door.  
  
Noah, visibly annoyed yet restrained, stopped her and said, ""No, don't overthink things. Stay.""  
  
Sadie observed their interactions from the sidelines, her heart sinking with a bitter sense of irony.  
  
Officially, she was Noah's wife, yet she sat there, feeling more like an unwelcome intruder in his life.  
  
Restlessness crept up on her, making it impossible to remain passive any longer.  
  
""Shall we go to the study now, Nigel?"" Sadie suggested, her voice steadier than she felt.  
  
Nigel, leaning heavily on his cane, responded with a sneer, ""I may be old, but I've still got some fight left in me! As for my granddaughter-in-law, Sadie is the only one I acknowledge. The others don't even come close!""  
  
He paused for emphasis, his tone hardening. ""And let me be clear--if I hear of anyone here hurting Sadie, they can kiss my shares goodbye.""  
  
At this declaration, Kyla clenched her fists, her nails almost digging into her palms, a clear flash of jealousy sparking in her eyes.  
  
Isabel, visibly upset, bit her lip, holding back her words.  
  
Noah bristled at the confrontation, loathing the sensation of being cornered, especially by Nigel.  
  
""Then go ahead and donate your shares,"" he retorted sharply, tugging at Kyla's arm to leave.  
  
""What did you just say, you ungrateful brat..."" Nigel's voice trembled with fury, his body shaking as he struggled to maintain his composure.  
  
Quickly, Sadie offered support as she guided him into the sanctuary of the study.  
  
Once inside, she spoke, her tone low and filled with weary acceptance. ""Don't bother forcing him--his heart was never mine to begin with.""  
  
Watching her composed demeanor, Nigel exhaled a heavy sigh, a mix of admiration and sorrow. ""It's truly Noah's loss, not yours.""  
  
He knew deep down that no matter how much he wanted to, he couldn't steer the lives of the younger generation.  
  
It pained him to see Sadie mistreated.  
  
With a resigned air, he pulled a document from his drawer and laid it before her.  
  
""Sadie, please, sign this.""  
  
The moment Sadie spotted the word ""shares"" on the contract, a sudden, piercing tension gripped her head.  
  
With a firm hand, she slid the document across the table, her voice steady but laced with resignation. ""This isn't mine to take. I married Noah knowing full well he had someone else in his heart. Now that she's here, it's only right that we put an end to our marriage.""  
  
With a solemn expression, Nigel ventured cautiously, ""Sadie, do you ever regret marrying Noah?""  
  
His question, unexpected and direct, made Sadie pause. She was momentarily taken aback, then offered a bitter smile as she shook her head. ""No, I don't regret it,"" she admitted, her voice tinged with a sorrowful resolve.  
  
Despite the searing pain, her love for Noah was something she could never regret.  
  
Yet, this love had grown too burdensome, teetering on the brink of crushing her.  
  
Sadie refused to sign the document.  
  
Nigel, seeing he couldn't sway her, handed her a card instead.  
  
As she stood to leave, he told her that if it became unbearable, she had no reason to keep suffering.  
  
He cared for Sadie with the affection one might show a beloved granddaughter, even if it meant standing against his own grandson.  
  
After she stepped away from the grandeur of the Wall Manor, Sadie didn't return to the home she still shared with Noah.  
  
Instead, she found solace in a modest, serviced apartment managed by a hotel.  
  
It had a bedroom and a living room, fully furnished, offering her solitude at an affordable price.  
  
Sadie grew to cherish this small, cozy sanctuary.  
  
Most importantly, it was free from Noah's presence and the excruciating memories that lingered around him.  
  
After a refreshing rinse, Sadie scrolled through her contacts, a pang of helplessness washing over her.  
  
No matter how she looked at it, she had no one to pretend to be her boyfriend.  
  
What excuse could she possibly give Laura for showing up alone?  
  
A wave of frustration crested within her, prompting her to run her fingers agitatedly through her hair.  
  
Accepting the inevitable, she surrendered to whatever happened next.  
  
If pressed, she'd lay out the truth for Laura--plain and simple.  
  
With her mind somewhat settled, Sadie busied herself with tidying the space.  
  
Thankfully, the little one nestled within her was cooperative today, not stirring up any discomfort.  
  
Just as she was lost in her cleaning frenzy, her phone buzzed to life.  
  
Noah was calling.  
  
Sadie's heart skipped. She was torn between answering and ignoring the call, but ultimately, she picked up.  
  
Noah's voice, icy and sharp, cut through the silence. ""Where the hell are you, Sadie? Why aren't you home? You're not causing trouble again, are you?""  
  
""Me? Causing trouble?"" Sadie's laugh was tinged with bitterness. ""Considering we're getting a divorce, I don't see how my whereabouts are your concern.""  
  
""I--""  
  
""Listen,"" Sadie interjected, her tone firm yet cool, ""I've accepted this divorce. I won't be clinging to you. And I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from bothering me further, Mr. Wall.""  
  
With a decisive click, Sadie ended the call, leaving Noah to stew in silence on the other end.  
  
His face twisted in anger as the line went dead.

1l1y6bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1l1y6bj/i_came_up_with_a_new_atrioc_joke_for_real/,I came up with a new Atrioc joke (for real),"Hey Atrioc fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the Atrioc community that Atrioc is a ""football ferret"", supposedly stating that he really like American football and, in fact, is a ""ferret"" for it. This, of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about Atrioc. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: Atrioc is a ""Alfredo Antelope"". The joke here is that it's saying that Atrioc really likes Alfredo Sauce, and in fact, is an ""antelope"" for it.

Okay chat now that I've lured you in with the joke bullshit and Atrioc has clicked away already, let's get down to brass tacks. I have real, undeniable proof that Atrioc caused the Alfredo sauce highway crash on the 31st of August, 2022.

Proof 1:

The first thing he says when he hears about the crash is that he has ""no thoughts on it""

How can he not have thoughts on it, isn't it a streamers job to have thoughts on everything? Isn't that why it is the hardest job in the world? Him saying he has ""no thoughts on it"" must mean that he is deflecting, that he is personally responsible for the crash.

Proof 2:

Someone deleted this post when it was first posted, and gaining a lot of traction. No reason was given, but another mod later confirmed it was... ATRIOC! HE WILL NOT SILENCE ME.

https://preview.redd.it/shyvdewhvl4f1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=210ef87152335ae0867511e159b4e6255f4a914c

Proof 3:

Atrioc's famous catchphrase ""Mamma Mia, the schools in Italy are no good"" give us an insight into the reprehensible mind of this man. Rather than taking responsibility for his stupidity, he throws the blame on the severely underpaid teachers. This shows a track record of dodging blame for his mistakes, which leads us to proof 3.

As we all know, Atrioc is a ""coffee cow"". A proven fact for decades. Well, after the stock market crashed due to the crash causing fluctuations in the price of Alfredo Sauce across the world, Starbucks stock went up by 20 cents.

1l1y5wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1l1y5wa/for_the_one_who_will_never_know/,For the one who will never know.,"Your birthday was yesterday.
We celebrated at work today.
Just treats, a few jokes, laughter echoing off the walls like it was nothing.
But for me, it was everything.

I stood there smiling, pretending I hadn’t been counting the days.
Pretending I hadn’t written and rewritten a message I’ll never send.
Pretending this was just another Monday,
and not the day I got to quietly celebrate you.

You don’t know that I noticed the way your eyes crinkled when you opened gifts.
Or that I memorized the way you leaned into the moment, just for a second.
You don’t know that I stayed a little longer than I should’ve.
Or that I didn’t sleep the night before.

I bought you coffee. Said it was nothing.
Laughed at your jokes like always.
Said happy birthday like it didn’t ache.

Because I love you.
And you don’t know.
And maybe you never will.

And God, I do.
I love you so quietly it echoes.
It hums through my ribs when you laugh,
flares in my chest when you say my name like it doesn’t ruin me.

I wish I could have told you.
That you’re the softest part of my day.
That loving you feels like breathing: natural, involuntary, and impossible to stop.

But I won’t. I’m too scared to ruin what we have.
So I’ll keep showing up, smiling,
celebrating you in small, invisible ways.

Because today, I got to stand in the same room while the world told you
you were loved.
And I pretended I wasn’t the one who meant it most.

Today, I got to see you smile.
And that was enough for now.

I know that you guys are well-served for quality of coffee, having had some really incredible stuff at Colonna & Smalls and WatchHouse, so I'd be pretty shocked to hear that you're all furious about the state of things. 

All the same, I'd appreciate it a lot if you'd take the time to go through this survey I whipped up. I'd also be interested in any thoughts that you guys have outside the realm of Bath, our outside the bounds of the survey.

So I (28F) have been giving a coworker (32M) a ride to work for the past couple of months. He doesn’t have a car right now, and we live about 10 minutes apart, so I figured it wasn’t a big deal. At first, it was fine — we’d chat a bit, he’d offer to buy me coffee occasionally, and it felt pretty balanced.

Lately, though, he’s been texting me super late at night asking for last-minute schedule changes, expecting me to wait for him when he’s running late (like, 15+ minutes late some days), and hasn’t offered anything in return in weeks. Not that I expect gas money or anything, but even a “thanks” would be nice. He also complains about my music and once asked if I could take a detour to stop at his friend’s house before work — which would have made me late.

I’ve started to dread picking him up, and I kind of just want to stop offering rides altogether. I mentioned maybe he should start looking into other options, and he got a bit passive-aggressive, saying, “Wow, okay, thanks for the heads-up.”

My boyfriend says I’m being too nice and should just cut it off, but some people at work have said it’s kind of harsh to leave someone hanging when you’ve already been helping.

Our info: I am US born 35f and he is immigrant 28m. I was previously married and have children from that marriage. We met two years ago, engaged after one year and married in August 2024. We filed November 2024. Biometrics done later that same month and EAD approved December. 

Interview was scheduled for 12:30 (Maple Shade NJ) and we were called back maybe 15-20 minutes after our appointment. Initially she began questions together. Basics like name, dob, parents and siblings names, she had me write my kids names on a slip of paper and she had him write his family’s names on a paper as well. She asked about when we got married while we were together. I gave the date and location then she asked my husband where we got married and he gave the city name but I guess she meant the physical location or name of the place and he stumbled at the question. Honestly I didn’t know what she wanted myself as I had already said the place but never the less he eventually answered. But at that point she separated us. We were prepared for that to happen so that was fine. 

I went first she asked basics still like how we met and where and about the proposals. She asked about our utilities at home. She specifically asked our utility company names. This was a new one for me and not something I’d seen in prep questions and I pay the bills so I knew but wasn’t sure my husband would have known. (He got 2/3 correct). She also asked me about my religion. This too was something that I wasn’t prepared for. I was raised in a religious home but no longer attend church and I told her so. My husband comes from a country that their religion is kind of a given. She only asked about my religion to me but asked him about mine and his own. She didn’t ask me about his… this seemed overall an odd line of questioning. She also asked what we did to celebrate his birthday and I answered. Our birthdays are only 3 days apart so we celebrated together. She then commented that I’m much older than him and asked if that was a problem. I told her no but she didn’t ask him about my age. Only me. 

The only thing he was asked different than me aside from the religion was about my kids. She asked if it bothered him that I had kids. I was honest with him from before we met that I had kids and it’s never been an issue. I even brought my son with me on our first meeting (it was a casual coffee date). 

Overall I felt she was colder with me and from what he tells me quite jovial with him. Laughing at his jokes. In the end she said to him we did well and would hear by mail the results. We’re hoping that it’s approval and soon so we can take the mental load off and sleep easier. Hope this info helps others prep!",15,1748909815.0,USCIS,4,1.0,False

The Indian stock market on June 2nd, 2025, presented a mixed bag of performances across various sectors, with Largecap stocks dominating the headlines.

This summary synthesizes the day's trading data, highlighting key trends, sector-specific performance, and technical indicators.

**Overall Market Sentiment and Sectoral Performance:**

The overall market sentiment appeared to be neutral to slightly negative, with several prominent Largecap stocks experiencing either marginal gains or losses. Several stocks closed the day with a negative return, while others managed to eke out small gains. This mixed performance suggests a degree of indecision among investors, potentially driven by prevailing economic uncertainties or sector-specific headwinds.

The **Pharmaceuticals sector** presented a mixed picture. **Sun Pharmaceutical Industries** showed a negative return of -0.32% for the day and **Cipla** was up 0.14%, suggesting a varied performance within the sector. Technical analysis reveals the daily pivot level for Sun Pharmaceutical at 1671.68 and Cipla's at 1463.

The **Auto sector** also reflected the broader trend. **Maruti Suzuki India** closed down by -0.64% and **Mahindra & Mahindra** showed a more positive result with a 1.63% increase, with the daily pivot levels at 12184.93 and 2987.18, respectively.

This variation in performance could be indicative of diverse approaches or challenges faced within the financial industry.

**Consumer Goods and Food Processing:**

The **Food Processing & Packaging sector**, saw contrasting results. **Britannia Industries** showed a substantial gain of 1.4%, while **Nestle India** declined by -0.04%. This variance might be attributed to company-specific factors or shifting consumer preferences. **Hindustan Unilever** in the **Personal Care** sector experienced a positive gain of 0.81%.

**Construction, Technology, and Energy:**

The **Construction, Contracting & Engineering sector** represented by **Larsen & Toubro** witnessed a marginal gain of 0.02%, suggesting that the sector could be in a consolidation phase. **Tech Mahindra** in the IT Consulting & Software sector, closed the day with -1.92% decrease, which implies a negative turn, with its daily pivot level at 1553.15. **Oil And Natural Gas Corporation** experienced a decrease of -0.67% closing, operating in the Oil Drilling and Exploration sector. Technical analysis placed its daily pivot level at 238.82.

The **Port & Port Services sector** as represented by **Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone** experienced a strong positive gain of 2.27% showing its resilience, with its daily pivot level at 1441.95.

**Technical Analysis and Key Levels:**

The data provided includes daily pivot levels and resistance levels for each stock, offering insights into potential price movements and investor sentiment. These technical indicators are crucial for day traders and short-term investors. The daily pivot levels provide a benchmark to assess the overall stability of each stock. Resistance levels also indicate potential price barriers that the stock may face during the next trading session. The ability of a stock to break through these levels may serve as a signal of the market's confidence in the company and the stock.

**Looking Ahead:**

The mixed performance across various sectors suggests a period of market consolidation, with investors carefully evaluating risks and rewards. The resistance levels identified provide key benchmarks for assessing potential price movements in the short term. Sector-specific factors and global economic trends will likely continue to influence market dynamics.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1l1xz9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1l1xz9s/the_phone_calls_you_get_at_work/,The phone calls you get at work...,"Hello, fellow petty potatoes, and glad tidings to our fair Potato Queen and Consort!

I am an American expat living in Australia and boy, do I have a customer service story for you! Strap in kids, because shit's about to get weird.

An older gentleman called my work phone line one afternoon while I'm working from home. After assisting him with his query, he asked me where I'm located. We then had a bit of small talk about the weather in our respective locations. I don't mind this - some people just like to chat for a while.

Now I have a ""customer service"" voice. Anyone who's ever worked in a job where they regularly deal with members of the public knows about this concept. Mine is a bit higher pitched than my usual speaking voice, and super smiley and friendly.

>HIM: ""So can I tell you a quick story before I let you go, or do you need to get back to work?""

It's almost 3pm by this stage, so I told him sure - I could use a short break and a cuppa anyway, so go for it.

>HIM: ""Okay, good. On a scale of 1 to 10, how curious are you?""

...what? I'm obviously a bit confused, but I assume he's asking how curious I am about his story.

>ME: ""Umm, I suppose maybe an eight? Speaking conservatively.""

>HIM: ""An eight out of ten speaking conservatively. You must be very curious!""

>ME: ""Yeah I guess I'm fairly curious about what you want to tell me.""

He then tells me that he does voiceover work for a living, and he does this freelance for ebooks, commercials, etc. Okay! So that's actually kind of cool, and I say as much.

>HIM: ""How curious are you now?""

>ME: ""I'm actually more curious now. I'm racking my brain trying to figure out if I've come across any of your work before.""

>HIM: ""Okay, good. So I'm going to do an impression for you.""

I am now genuinely curious. I think awesome - he's going to give me a hint of what I might know him from.

>ME: ""Okay, go for it.""

>HIM: ""I'm going to play the mean boss.""

In my mind, I'm naively thinking maybe there's a mean boss character out there in the advertising world that I just don't recall offhand. Well, maybe not naively thinking so much as hoping this isn't going where I suspect. I give an ever-so slightly nervous chuckle and try to save the conversation.

>ME: ""Oooookay. I've had a few of those - not now, of course - so I'm definitely familiar with what those are like.""

>HIM: ""But I'm going to be the FUN mean boss.""

...what does that even mean! I don't say anything for a good three seconds, and then I laugh nervously, still desperately clinging to my dwindling hope for a normal conversation.

>ME: ""...okay...?""

>HIM: ""And I want you to call me Big Boss.""

Whoop, there it is! I fully know where this is going. I'm also morbidly curious, which I deeply regret.

>ME: ""Umm...right...?""

>HIM: ""So what are you going to call me?""

I start questioning my life choices and respond through gritted teeth whilst somehow still using my customer service voice.

>ME: ""...Big Boss...""

>HIM: ""I want you say it louder.""

By this stage, any semblance of professionalism has fully failed me and I burst out laughing.

>ME: ""Dude, my husband is working from home right now too. I am NOT saying that louder!""

>HIM: ""Okay okay, I understand. You need to be careful.""

I stop laughing and start quietly contemplate my role in the universe. His voice is basically crooning at this stage.

>HIM: ""So now I want you to sit back...and drink your coffee.""

I am silently in full existential crisis mode.

>HIM: ""Now how curious are you?""

This train has officially arrived at Assholeville, I've had a quick look around from the carriage window and I am officially over it. I respond in the most customer service way I can.

>ME: ""Umm, I am a whole lot less curious now if I'm honest.""

Suddenly the crooner is gone and replaced with a seeming normal human being.

>HIM: ""Okay, well you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye!""

...WHAT JUST HAPPENED. I've been in some interesting situations in my day, but that has to be the single weirdest conversation I've had in my adult life.

I know the affect a foreign accent has one some people, especially when it's a female with a foreign accent. Back in the day when I used to work in customer service roles full time, I got a lot of, ""How's it going, love?"" and older dudes putting on the charm. But this....this was definitely a first.

1l1xynl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1l1xynl/aita_for_not_planning_any_birthday_surprises_for/,AITA for not planning any birthday surprises for my husband when he said he didn’t want anything?,"My (40F) husband (40M) turned 40 today, and for months I wanted to do something special on his day.  I asked about a party, a cake, a present, an outing, etc. and he said “no” to it all.  We got back from a vacation yesterday, and on the trip I’d been sick (only sleeping maybe 4 hours a night for 8 days) almost the whole time.  Today, the day of his birthday, I finally slept and was in bed until 2pm.  When I got up, I ate something, and maybe at 3pm my husband then got sick and slept until 5pm before being starting to vomit.  He has previously suggested a movie, and so I’d planned out a restaurant and the movie theater time/location for when he woke up, but obviously that didn’t work out with the vomiting.  

He’s terribly angry at me now for not planning anything.  By contrast, my friends and I planned the 40th birthday party I wanted, I ordered my own cake for the party, I cooked for the party, and I suggested my own presents like books, jewelry, a coffee maker, etc.  He got me a card, a necklace, a coffee maker, and a book, and he took me out to my favorite sushi restaurant the day of after I asked him to choose a restaurant and had made all those suggestions for presents (and had walked him through which books and coffee maker I wanted while he was in the shop; the necklace he chose on his own).  

He’d said all week while on vacation he just wanted to stay home because we’d be tired from vacation.  I take what people say literally due to my communication style and ADHD, especially when I’d been so sick last week and he insisted he didn’t want me to do anything.  He’s currently slamming doors, snapping and yelling at me, and saying that he will “never forget this”.  I’m now really upset at myself because I feel like I should have planned something despite what he said, as I know this is a milestone birthday.  

Before we left I did give him a “gift certificate” to go to a shooting range with him twice, once on his birthday or a day of his choosing and once with him and my dad on another day since today my dad is out of town.  (His family lives in another country, so doing something with them isn’t possible.)

On his first birthday when we were together, I made him a very labor-intensive cake from scratch since he’d always had shop-bought ones.  On his 35th I arranged a COVID party outside while socially distancing.  On other birthdays I’d gotten him presents, but he went to visit family in another country earlier this year, and due to finances we decided that his trip would be his birthday present.

So, AITA for doing what he asked, especially after he only did things on my birthday that I suggested? ",1,1748909464.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

# Best Drinking Straw Cleaning Brush 2025: Top Picks!

The drinking straw cleaning brush is a seemingly simple but essential tool for maintaining hygiene and promoting sustainability. With the increasing popularity of reusable straws, ranging from stainless steel to silicone, a dedicated cleaning brush has become indispensable. This review will guide you through the best drinking straw cleaning brushes available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision for a cleaner, healthier, and more eco-conscious lifestyle.

[[Explore Top Rated drinking straw cleaning brush on Amazon.]](https://blog.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=drinking straw cleaning brush)

## key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a drinking straw cleaning brush hinges on several key features. These include the brush material, handle design, brush length and diameter, durability, and versatility.

**Brush Material:**

The brush material is critical for effective cleaning and durability. Typically, bristles are made from nylon or stainless steel.Nylon bristles are generally softer and more flexible, making them suitable for delicate materials like silicone or glass straws. They are also effective at dislodging residue without scratching the straw's surface. Stainless steel bristles, conversely, offer more aggressive cleaning power and are ideal for removing stubborn buildup in metal straws. However, they must be used with caution to avoid scratching softer materials.

**Handle Design:**

The handle's design directly impacts the user's grip and control during cleaning. A comfortable and ergonomic handle can significantly ease the cleaning process, especially for longer straws or those with intricate designs. handles are commonly made from plastic, stainless steel, or wood. Plastic handles are lightweight and inexpensive, while stainless steel handles provide durability and a sleek aesthetic. Wooden handles offer a natural feel and eco-kind appeal. Look for handles with non-slip grips or textured surfaces to enhance control, even when wet.

**Brush Length and Diameter:**

The length and diameter of the brush are essential for compatibility with various straw sizes and types. A longer brush can easily clean longer straws, while a brush with a smaller diameter is suitable for narrow straws.A set of brushes with varying sizes is frequently enough the best option to accommodate different straw dimensions. Consider the length of your longest straw and the diameter of your narrowest straw when selecting a cleaning brush or set. A brush that's too short won't reach the bottom of the straw, and a brush that's too wide won't fit inside.

**Durability:**

Durability ensures the brush can withstand repeated use without falling apart. This depends on the quality of the materials used and the construction of the brush. Look for brushes with tightly secured bristles to prevent shedding and sturdy handles that won't bend or break easily. Stainless steel brushes generally offer superior durability compared to nylon brushes, but proper care and maintenance can extend the lifespan of any brush.**Versatility:**

A versatile cleaning brush can be used for various cleaning tasks beyond just straws. Some brushes are designed with flexible heads or angled tips to reach into tight corners and crevices of other items, such as bottle nozzles, sippy cup parts, and even small household appliances. A versatile brush can be a valuable addition to your cleaning toolkit.

## Core Benefits

Using a dedicated drinking straw cleaning brush offers several core benefits, including improved hygiene, extended straw lifespan, and environmental consciousness.

**Improved Hygiene:** By fully removing food and drink residue, cleaning brushes eliminate bacteria and mold growth, ensuring a cleaner and healthier drinking experience. This is particularly critically important for reusable straws, which can harbor harmful pathogens if not properly cleaned. Regularly cleaning your straws with a brush prevents buildup that can affect the taste of your drinks and perhaps cause illness.

**Extended Straw Lifespan:** Regular cleaning with the appropriate brush prevents buildup and corrosion, extending the life of your reusable straws. This is especially true for metal straws, which can be susceptible to rust if not properly maintained. Proper cleaning also prevents the degradation of silicone straws, ensuring they remain flexible and functional for longer. Investing in a good cleaning brush is an investment in the longevity of your reusable straws.

**Environmental Consciousness:** Reusable straws are an eco-friendly choice to disposable plastic straws, but they only provide environmental benefits if they are properly maintained and used for an extended period. By using a cleaning brush to extend the lifespan of your reusable straws, you reduce your reliance on disposable alternatives and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. This simple act can have a notable positive impact on the habitat over time. Choosing reusable items and cleaning them properly contributes to reducing waste in landfills and oceans.

**Elimination of Odors and Tastes:** Regular cleaning prevents the accumulation of residue that can cause unwanted odors and tastes in your straws. This ensures that your drinks taste fresh and clean every time. Built-up residue can also affect the color and appearance of your straws, making them look dirty even after washing. A cleaning brush effectively removes these residues, keeping your straws looking and tasting their best.

## FAQs Section

**Are all drinking straw cleaning brushes the same size, or do I need different sizes for different straws?**

No, drinking straw cleaning brushes come in various sizes to accommodate different straw diameters and lengths. It's best to have a set of brushes with varying sizes to ensure you can clean all your straws effectively. Consider the dimensions of your straws when selecting a cleaning brush set.

**How often should I clean my reusable drinking straws?**

Ideally, you should clean your reusable drinking straws after each use to prevent the buildup of bacteria and residue. If that's not possible, aim to clean them at least once a day. Regular cleaning will keep your straws hygienic and extend their lifespan.

**Can I put my drinking straw cleaning brush in the dishwasher?**

Some drinking straw cleaning brushes are dishwasher safe,but it depends on the materials they are made from. Check the manufacturer's instructions before placing your brush in the dishwasher. Brushes with wooden handles may not be dishwasher safe, and high heat can damage nylon bristles over time.

**What is the best way to store my drinking straw cleaning brush?**

After cleaning your drinking straw cleaning brush, allow it to air dry fully before storing it. This prevents bacteria or mold growth. You can store it in a dry, well-ventilated area, such as a utensil holder or a dedicated cleaning supply caddy. Avoid storing it in a damp or enclosed space.

1l1xxwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1l1xxwv/my_new_husband_is_disabled_yet_he_manages_to_wear/,"""My new husband is disabled, yet he manages to wear me out every night""- How About We Get Married?","Chapter1 How About We Get Married?  
""Kaelyn knows about our wedding, and now she's threatening to jump off a building. You are aware of her depression, aren't you? I have to go save her,"" Theo explained impatiently and pushed Elyse aside.  
  
""Today is our wedding day! What am I supposed to do if you leave? Kaelyn Bennett totally stabbed you in the back before. She's caused you so much pain-why the heck must you go see her right now?""  
  
The push caused Elyse to sprain her ankle, and as she fell to the floor, she awkwardly stretched out her hand, trying to hold him back.  
  
Theo's gaze turned even colder. ""You're not in a position to judge what happened between me and Kaelyn. No matter her wrongs or the pain she caused, you don't measure up to her.""  
  
A pain struck Elyse's heart. She realized that he had never truly forgotten Kaelyn. To him, she would never be as significant as Kaelyn was.  
  
""What did I do to deserve this? Why are you treating me this way? Please, just wait until the wedding is over. We're almost at the point of exchanging rings. You can leave after that.""  
  
Theo dodged her hand and said with disgust, ""You're more concerned with your wedding than a living person's life. You're so heartless. Let's reschedule the wedding.""  
  
Without a glance at her pale face, he strode away from the ornate altar, oblivious to the puzzled looks of gathered guests.  
  
As the groom left, the crowd erupted into chaos.  
  
""No, please don't leave me, Theo! What should I do if you leave?"" Elyse cried out, sitting pitifully on the floor. She trembled, tears ruining her carefully applied makeup.  
  
The man she had loved for three years, disregarding her dignity, had chosen another woman without a second thought on their big day. He was consumed with thoughts of Kaelyn's distress but seemed indifferent to how lost and humiliated she felt, left alone at the altar.  
All around her, countless eyes watched, some mocking, some pitying, and others even gloating. Elyse had never felt such torment!  
  
Her father, Lanny Lloyd, approached. She hoped for comfort, but instead, he scolded her sharply, ""You can't even keep a man. How useless!"" After berating her, he left with his wife, Glenda Lloyd, without a backward glance.  
  
Her sister, Mabel Lloyd, emerged from the crowd with a smirk. ""Well, that's embarrassing, Elyse. Your groom ran off, and now you're a laughingstock. I'm embarrassed for you. Imagine how Mom and Dad feel."" After saying that, she turned and left.  
  
One by one, all of Elyse's family members departed, leaving her completely alone. Initially, Theo's parents felt guilty, but upon witnessing her family's reaction, all traces of guilt dissipated.  
  
""Even her own parents didn't support her. It seems this isn't entirely Theo's fault.""  
  
""Yes, if she were a good partner, why would her fiancé leave her?""  
  
""Did she cheat on him? What else would make a groom leave like that?""  
  
The murmurs of criticism from the surrounding guests grew louder and harsher.  
  
Suddenly, there were noises nearby.  
  
Turning around, Elyse spotted a man in a suit sitting alone in a wheelchair. The officiant, looking flustered, asked, ""Where is your bride?""  
  
Wiping away her tears, she halted a passing staff member and inquired, ""That man is a groom, right? Where is his bride?""  
  
The staff member glanced at her and responded, ""She didn't show up. I heard it was because she couldn't deal with her husband's disability.""  
  
""And he's been waiting here all this time?""  
  
The staff member nodded.  
  
The wheelchair-bound groom was facing away from Elyse, and they were a fair distance apart. She couldn't see his expression, but she understood the pain of being left alone.  
They were both unfortunate souls, abandoned.  
  
After a moment of reflection, a determined look settled in Elyse's eyes.  
  
She had loved Theo for three years, but he had betrayed her. Why should she remain loyal to him? She realized she didn't need to be with him at all.  
  
As she suddenly stood up, the guests who had been whispering and mocking her fell silent. All eyes instinctively focused on her as she lifted the hem of her dress and confidently walked toward the man in the wheelchair.  
  
The sight of a bride in a white wedding dress approaching left the man's guests equally stunned.  
  
Hearing the rustle of her dress, the man in the wheelchair turned around slowly.  
  
Elyse halted and gazed at the handsome man before her, a spark of surprise in her eyes. She then extended her hand and said, ""Hello, I heard you're in need of a bride. My groom just left me. How about we get married?""  
  
  
Chapter2 What Was She Up To?  
""My name is Elyse Lloyd. If it's all right with you, we can get married today,"" she proposed confidently.  
  
Her bold proposal left the crowd in shock, prompting several to capture the moment with their phones.  
  
""Miss Lloyd, are you certain about this decision? Given my disability, I may not be able to provide the future you envision,"" the man replied openly, without hiding his condition, and gently urged her to think it over.  
  
""I've made up my mind,"" Elyse responded with determination.  
  
""I'm Jayden,"" he introduced himself.  
  
Seeing her resolve, Jayden Owen grasped her hand and shared his concern, ""I fear you might regret this choice later on.""  
  
Elyse chose not to respond. She was sure of her decision. She had once been solely focused on marrying Theo, who never truly reciprocated her love. Now, who she married seemed inconsequential.  
  
After efficiently wrapping up the wedding formalities at City Hall, Elyse and Jayden were now bound by matrimony, officially united as husband and wife.  
  
With the marriage certificate in hand, Elyse experienced a profound sense of relief.  
  
Theo had broken her heart, and she was resolute in never returning to him.  
  
Regarding her father, since she would not be marrying into the Ward family, he had another daughter to think about.  
  
She understood her little sister Mabel too well. As someone driven by greed, how could Mabel resist the temptation to become Theo's wife and a member of the Ward family?  
  
Thus, marrying Jayden was Elyse's perfect escape from her family's clutches. She had no intention of going back home again.  
  
While she gazed thoughtfully at the marriage certificate, Jayden asked, ""What's on your mind? Regretting your decision to marry a disabled man?""  
  
Elyse shook her head, took hold of the wheelchair, and replied, ""I think it was a good decision.""  
  
Jayden smiled slightly, though his eyes betrayed a hint of skepticism and mistrust.  
  
How could any woman genuinely want to marry a disabled man? He figured she was just putting on an act-an act that couldn't last forever.  
  
He needed a bride momentarily to distract his family while he pursued his own goals. Well, he decided, he might as well see what she was up to.  
  
Elyse helped Jayden into the car, and they drove to his house.  
  
Jayden's home was opulent, complete with a garden and a swimming pool, and staffed with a butler in a tuxedo and uniformed maids.  
  
As Elyse stepped onto the plush wool carpet, she truly realized that her new husband was far from ordinary.  
  
The butler, Driscoll Lee, approached them respectfully and inquired, ""Mr. Owen, is this your bride?""  
  
Surveying the opulent house and recollecting her newlywed husband's full name, a sudden realization dawned on Elyse.  
  
The Owens were the most influential family in town, and Jayden Owen was particularly notable among his peers for his business acumen and exceptional talent. He was one of the wealthiest men around. However, after a car accident a year ago that cost him his legs, Jayden had faded from the public eye and his prior achievements were largely forgotten.  
  
So, she had married the legendary Jayden Owen?  
  
Elyse recalled hearing rumors about his engagement to a girl from the Foster family. The bride who had disappeared on her wedding day was supposed to be that Foster girl.  
  
Upon hearing Jayden's full name at City Hall, Elyse hadn't dwelled on it much. If she had known his background sooner, she wouldn't have had the courage to broach the topic of marriage with him.  
  
Jayden noticed the shock and panic on her face but remained silent. He still doubted that she truly hadn't recognized him. After all, his disability was well known.  
  
""This is Elyse Lloyd, my wife. From now on, she will be the hostess here,"" Jayden introduced her firmly.  
  
""Joanna Foster escaped on our wedding day because she didn't want to marry a disabled man,"" he added bluntly.  
  
""Joanna Foster disappeared on the wedding day?"" Driscoll expressed his surprise. The Foster family had been eager to forge a union with the Owen family through marriage, pushing for Jayden to marry Joanna.  
  
On the wedding day, however, the bride had disappeared. Wasn't this a deliberate humiliation of Jayden?  
  
Driscoll felt sympathy for him and offered some consolation, ""Sir, perhaps it's for the best that she left. It seems you might have found the right person after all.""  
  
Elyse had shown no concern for Jayden's disability and was willing to marry him. That indeed counted for something.  
  
  
Chapter3 He Could Walk Fluidly  
Looking at Jayden's legs, Elyse felt a wave of sympathy for him. Jayden had once been at the pinnacle of success, and now he seemed so vulnerable. Just because he was disabled, his bride had callously abandoned him at the altar, showing him no respect whatsoever. He must have felt even more devastated than she did during the wedding.  
  
Approaching Jayden, Elyse took his hand and said earnestly, ""Don't worry. We are husband and wife now. I will take care of you for the rest of our lives.""  
  
Jayden's expression turned rigid. Could she really mean it, promising to take care of him for a lifetime? He doubted her sincerity, thinking she was just putting on an act of compassion.  
  
Without a word, Jayden maneuvered his wheelchair into the study on the first floor.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" Driscoll said apologetically. ""Since his accident, he's been a bit more temperamental.""  
  
""It's fine. I understand,"" Elyse replied, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. Anyone in his situation might change.  
  
She then followed Driscoll upstairs to a room on the second floor.  
  
\--  
  
""Sir.""  
  
In the study stood a bald man named Vinny Bailey, clad in a tight black shirt that accentuated his prominent tendons.  
  
Respectfully, Vinny ignited a lighter and lit a cigar for Jayden.  
  
""Joanna has gone abroad. The Foster family is desperately trying to come up with a solution.""  
  
""They've taken thirty million and five major projects from me. Is this their way of repaying me?""  
  
Jayden let out a puff of smoke and remarked casually, ""If I don't teach them a lesson, others will see me as a pushover. The Fosters need to learn a few things.""  
  
""Do you want us to bring Joanna back?"" Vinny inquired, nodding. ""And as for your new wife, should we make some introductions with our men?""  
  
""No need.""  
  
Jayden, cigar clenched between his teeth, lifted a document from the desk and strolled over to the window.  
  
The wheelchair was tucked away in a corner of the room, ignored, as he moved fluidly across the floor.  
  
This document detailed Elyse's entire life, from her childhood through to her college life, even including her romance with Theo.  
  
He casually flipped through the pages and drawled, ""An ordinary woman. She married me just for my money.""  
Back then, the Owens had declared their search for a wife for Jayden, aiming simply to secure an heir.  
  
Upon the announcement, no wealthy family was eager to marry their daughter to him, except for the Fosters, who had enriched themselves through their daughters' marriage.  
  
The Fosters' motive was straightforward-to exchange their daughter for resources and money.  
  
Vinny saw no other reason for Elyse to marry Jayden but for financial gain.  
  
Yet, there was another twist. ""She was originally going to marry Theo Ward.""  
  
""Ward? The Ward family that's well-known?"" Jayden lifted an eyebrow.  
  
""Yes. But apparently, the groom ran off to reunite with his ex-girlfriend after receiving a phone call.""  
  
Vinny paused, then speculated, ""Maybe she married you just to spite Theo Ward.""  
  
Jayden ceased perusing the documents and glanced up at Vinny with a hint of annoyance. ""You're looking at it too simplistically. By marrying me, she stands to gain more. That's the real reason she married me, despite my disability.""  
  
In Jayden's eyes, Elyse hadn't yet revealed her true intentions. But he didn't mind her interest in his money.  
  
He needed a wife to appease his family. If she married him for gain, it would make a future divorce simpler for him.  
  
\--  
  
Perched on the edge of the bed, Elysee scrolled through her phone and noticed the trending topics.  
  
\#Bridegroom Ran Away For His Ex  
  
\#Bride Marries Stranger To Anger Her Ranaway Groom  
  
She casually scrolled through the comments. The public deemed the entire situation unbelievable and both parties' actions as unreasonable. Nevertheless, discussions had thrust Elyse's name into circulation because of it.  
  
Some even discovered she was a violinist in an orchestra and stumbled upon a video of her past performance.  
  
Unable to resist, Elyse was watching these videos when Theo called. ""Where are you, Elyse? Let's meet and talk.""  
  
  
Chapter4 Who Were You Married To?  
As Elyse descended the stairs to the villa's entrance, Driscoll approached her with concern. ""It's quite late. Where are you off to? Shall I arrange a car for you?""  
  
""No, thanks. I'll be back soon.""  
  
Driscoll watched her depart before heading to the study.  
  
Elyse, having agreed to meet Theo, called a taxi and was soon en route.  
  
Fifteen minutes later, she entered a coffee shop and instantly noticed Theo, who was in high spirits, busy texting on his phone. A flicker of sarcasm crossed her eyes as she approached and sat across from him.  
  
Theo looked up, his expression souring. ""Why are you so late? Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting?""  
  
Staring back at him, Elyse felt a chill. They had been together for a long time, yet he was always domineering toward her, a stark contrast to his demeanor with Kaelyn.  
  
She had once loved him, believing she could endure anything. Only today had she realized how foolish that was.  
  
If she didn't love herself, how could she expect anyone else to love her?  
  
""If you don't want to wait, you can leave,"" Elyse retorted icily.  
  
Theo, taken aback by her response, grew visibly more upset. ""You're holding a grudge about what happened at the wedding, aren't you? I get why you're upset, but you can't be more understanding and reasonable? I left because Kaelyn was in dire straits-she was depressed and contemplating suicide.""  
  
""You can go to anyone you want. You don't need to explain anything to me-I don't care anymore."" Elyse found humor in his words.  
  
Theo couldn't believe she was indifferent. They had been together for three years, and everyone knew how deeply she loved him.  
  
He thought her claim of indifference was merely a result of anger. But he was confident he could easily resolve this. Just a few sweet words and she'd come back to him.  
  
""It's not a big deal. I came back to you after handling everything, didn't I? I'll visit your parents soon, and we can start planning the wedding again,"" Theo said.  
  
""No need for that.""  
  
""What?""  
  
""There won't be a wedding."" Elyse's face was devoid of emotion. ""We're done.""  
  
""Why are you still upset? I left at the wedding, but I came back for you. Can't you forgive me?"" Theo frowned.  
  
""Forgive you? Forgive you for abandoning me for another woman?"" Elyse slammed her hand on the table. ""Do you have any idea what I've been through since you left? Your family has been calling me names, even though you were the one who left me at the altar- just for another woman!""  
  
""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo shouted her name furiously. ""What others say is their issue. Isn't our three-year relationship strong enough for you to trust me?""  
  
""Three years, and yet you never forgot your ex,"" Elyse countered, her face marked by disappointment. ""I believed we'd be together forever, but it seems three years was our limit. We're done, Theo. It's clear we're not suited for each other.""  
  
While speaking, she retrieved a ring from her bag and set it down on the table-the same ring he had used to propose.  
  
She recalled the joy she felt that day, now overshadowed by her current despair.  
  
Elyse gave Theo one last look, mentally closing the chapter on their three years together. She grabbed her bag and departed without a backward glance.  
  
Theo was stunned. Was Elyse dumping him? He always saw her as a simp, her family reliant on his. How could she just walk away?  
  
Humiliated, he chased after her, grabbed her shoulder, and said forcefully, ""You have no right to break things off! Remember, your father's business relies on me. Without me, your family has nothing. Come back, and we'll marry in a few days to make up for today!""  
  
""Let me go!"" Elyse fought back fiercely and yelled with defiance and frustration, ""I'm married. Stop bothering me!""  
  
""So what if you are married! You will always belong to me.""  
  
After blurting that out, he froze and asked incredulously, ""What did you say? You're married? Who to?""  
  
While he was momentarily dazed, Elyse wriggled free from his grip. She hadn't anticipated turning around to find Jayden sitting in a wheelchair quietly a few meters behind her. ""Jayden!"" she exclaimed.  
  
  
Chapter5 You Can Stand?  
""Didn't I make it clear? I'm married. We're over. This is my husband,"" Elyse said as she quickly moved to Jayden's side, gripping his arm.  
  
Theo stared at Jayden, failing to recognize him. With a sneer, he said, ""To get back at me, you married a disabled man?"" He then extended his hand, commanding in a domineering tone, ""Elyse, come here! I'll make it up to you when we get back.""  
  
But Elyse looked at him as if he were a stranger.  
  
""Did you hear me? Come here!"" Theo grew frustrated.  
  
Elyse reflected on how she would have responded in the past-she would definitely walk over to his side.  
  
She had loved him deeply for three years. Her feelings had been genuine. Yet, the depth of her affection made the betrayal harder to bear.  
  
On her first birthday after they got together, she wanted to celebrate it by the sea. To make her happy, Theo bought a camera, promising to capture beautiful photos of her. As they were about to board the plane for their trip to the seaside, Kaelyn was injured on a film set and called Theo. Without any hesitation, Theo left her stranded at the airport. It was the most disappointing birthday Elyse had ever experienced.  
  
Theo had once vowed to attend her debut performance with her orchestra, yet she ended up not seeing him there. She lingered in the hall all night, only to learn the next day that he had missed the performance because Kaelyn had become drunk at a dinner party while trying to land a role. He stayed because he was worried she might be taken advantage of.  
For three years, he had been Kaelyn's protector, but he had never offered Elyse the same safeguard.  
  
This accumulation of disappointments came to a head at the wedding. She knew she deserved love and respect, not neglect.  
  
""I am Jayden's wife now. I owe my loyalty to him,"" declared Elyse with a chill in her voice.  
  
""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo roared, enraged. He thought Elyse was merely being spiteful and fabricating things due to the day's incidents.  
  
As he tried to seize her hand, Jayden intervened, blocking him swiftly.  
  
Theo struggled to free his hand, but was unable to. He couldn't overpower a disabled man? The realization pissed him off.  
  
""Release me!"" Theo exploded with anger.  
  
""She has no desire to leave with you. Can't you understand?"" Jayden pressed slowly, his force causing Theo's features to twist in distress.  
  
Jayden held on until Theo cried out in pain before releasing him.  
  
""Remember this day, Elyse. You'll regret it in the future!"" With a hint of embarrassment, Theo glared at Elyse and stormed off after his declaration.  
  
Watching him leave, Elyse felt a bitter smile form within her. She knew Theo would not easily let go of being humiliated, but there was no turning back for them now.  
  
""Let's go home, Elyse.""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
After helping Jayden into the car, they both sat silently, gazing out the window and avoiding any mention of Theo.  
  
""How did you know I was out here?"" Elyse asked, her curiosity piqued.  
  
Without turning to face her, Jayden replied, ""Driscoll mentioned it wasn't safe for you to be alone at this hour, so I came to pick you up.""  
  
In truth, he had suspected she was up to something secretive, but it turned out she was merely meeting her ex. This revelation left him slightly disappointed.  
  
""Since you've married me, you should sever ties with your ex. My family members are strict, and I can't cover for you if they find out you're still seeing another man.""  
  
""I won't see him again. I met him just to return a ring,"" Elyse responded, nodding.  
  
Jayden said nothing more. As long as Elyse respected his boundaries, she was free to make her own choices.  
  
When they arrived home, Elyse noticed Jayden heading straight for the study again. Curious, she asked Driscoll, ""Why is he always in the study?""  
  
""The study is not only his workplace, but it has also become a sanctuary for his soul,"" Driscoll explained.  
  
""And why doesn't he return to his room?""  
  
""He does sometimes, but we rarely know when. He prefers that we don't fuss over him too much.""  
  
With that, Driscoll departed. After freshening up in her room, Elyse was preparing for bed, but her thoughts lingered on the day's events with Jayden. She realized that despite his reserved nature, he was genuinely concerned for her safety.  
  
Feeling grateful and wanting to express her thanks, she left her room and walked towards the study. As she approached, she noticed the door was slightly ajar, casting a sliver of light into the hallway.  
  
Elyse pushed the door open and to her surprise, saw Jayden standing. She gasped and asked, ""Jayden, you can stand?""  
  
……  
  
====  
""You need a bride, I need a groom. Why don't we get married?"" Both abandoned at the altar, Elyse decided to tie the knot with the disabled stranger from the venue next door.   
Pitying his state, she vowed to spoil him once they were married. Little did she know that he was actually a powerful and healthy tycoon.   
Was Jayden's fake disability revealed just like that?

His twin brother, Dylan Anderson, told Leanna in a hoarse voice, ""Brenton... he's not coming back.""

She fainted immediately.

When she arrived, she went into a frenzy trying to find him, only to be held back tightly by her mother-in-law.

Later, she took sleeping pills and attempted to suicide three times, each time being saved.

Everyone said, ""Their relationship was truly remarkable...""

Indeed, it was.

So remarkable that only three months after his ""death,"" she discovered—Brenton wasn't the one who died.

\*\*\*

On the night Leanna was rescued from her third suicide attempt, she arrived at her husband's family home with a pale face. She intended to ask her mother-in-law, Ivy Cade, for some of Brenton's belongings to ease her grief. But as she approached, she overheard low voices coming from the inner room.

""Brenton, how long are you going to keep hiding this? Leanna has attempted suicide three times because of you!""

Her fingers clenched into her palm.

Brenton?

Why was Ivy calling Dylan, Brenton's older brother, by that name?

""Mom, just wait a bit longer,"" Dylan replied. It was unmistakably his voice, but the tone was similar to Brenton's when he used to comfort her.

""Before Dylan passed away, he asked me to take care of Crystal. She's fragile and weak. If she learned of his death, she wouldn't be able to survive. So I had no choice but to assume his identity... to give her a child. With a child to hold onto, she might have the strength to go on.""

Leanna felt as though her blood had turned cold, unable to believe what she had just heard.

It was Dylan who had passed away, not Brenton.

""Her husband was still alive. But he had taken on his brother's name and identity, and was sleeping in the next room—

with Crystal.""

""What about Leanna?"" Ivy pressed with urgency. ""You stay in Crystal's room every night. Haven't you thought about Leanna's feelings?""

""She's stronger than Crystal...""

Those words cut into Leanna like a knife. She stumbled backward, accidentally knocking a painting off the wall, and plunging the room into silence.

But she turned and fled as if pursued by wild beasts.

For three months, she had awoken from her dreams in tears countless times. Now, it all felt like a cruel joke.

Her husband wasn't dead.

He'd let her think he was—for Crystal's sake.

Five years ago, she first encountered Brenton at a social gathering.

He was the hockey team's captain, and she was a cheerleader.

But that night, he stood by the stage and watched her intently as she danced. When she finished, he strode up onto the stage in front of everyone, draped his coat over her shoulders, and said, ""It's chilly. Don't catch a cold.""

She wore his coat and blushed with shyness.

After that, he started pursuing her. He'd go out of his way just to see her.

When she finally agreed to be his girlfriend, he celebrated by getting completely drunk. He lifted her up and spun her around in the yard, saying, ""Leanna, for my entire life, I, Brenton Anderson, will recognize only you as my one and only.""

After their marriage, everyone said that he was utterly devoted to his wife.

And she believed it. She truly believed he loved her more than life itself.

But now?

To ""take care of"" Crystal, he had taken on his older brother's identity, shared a bed with her, and was even planning to have a child with her.

Meanwhile, she'd been weeping like a fool, willing to die for him, living each day in unbearable pain.

Did he ever think that she might feel pain too?

When she returned home in a daze, Sadie visited again.

""Leanna, Ethan will be transferred to Hawaii in two weeks. This is the seventh time he's sent me to ask... He said if you still refuse, he won't come back. Ever.""

Ethan Madren was Brenton's comrade from the army.

Since the day she was labeled a ""widow,"" he had repeatedly proposed to her.

She had turned him down six times before, believing that she would only ever love Brenton.

But then...

She glanced up and said calmly, ""Alright, I'll marry him.""

Sadie was stunned. ""Are you serious?""

""Yes,"" she replied with a smile. ""Please tell Ethan that in two weeks, I'll marry him and go to Hawaii with him.""

Suddenly, the door curtain was pulled aside, and Brenton appeared with a stern expression. ""Leanna, who are you planning to marry?""

She looked at him. For a moment, the situation felt laughable.

""Dylan,"" she said softly, ""This is my choice.""

Although he was speaking to Sadie, he seized Leanna's wrist with such force it hurt. ""I'll look after Leanna. She doesn't need to remarry. Besides, she loves Brenton too much to ever do that. Sadie, don't come here again, or I'll have to show you the way out!""

Sadie was shocked, ""But Leanna has already agreed...""

Leanna interrupted Sadie mid-sentence by grabbing her arm. ""Sadie, didn't you say you needed to go to the supermarket? You should hurry, it'll close soon.""

Sadie, momentarily distracted, nodded and left quickly.

Once Sadie was gone, Brenton let out a sigh of relief. He stepped slightly closer, his voice earnest. ""Leanna, even though Brenton is gone, don't worry. I'll look after you. If any matchmakers approach you, just send them away...""

Leanna found the situation absurd.

He spent his nights sneaking into Crystal's room, yet he was afraid she might leave or remarry.

It made no sense.

But she said nothing. Just nodded.

In any case, she'd be marrying someone else in two weeks and leaving this place forever. He wouldn't be able to control her anymore.

At night, Leanna was packing her suitcase when she suddenly heard the creaking of a wooden bed from the next room.

In the past, she would have assumed it was just Dylan and his wife being affectionate.

But now, every gasp felt like a dull knife cutting through her flesh.

She recognized those suppressed groans as Brenton's, the kind he used to whisper in her ear when he was excited.

Leanna rushed out just in time to see Brenton holding a half-dressed Crystal in his arms as he ran outside. Under the moonlight, a vivid red stain spread across her white pajama pants.

""What's happening here?"" someone asked.

""I heard things got too intense, and she started bleeding,"" another replied.

""Tsk, Dylan always seems so serious, who'd have guessed he's so tender with his wife...""

Leanna was in the crowd, feeling a shiver run through her.

She was about to turn and leave when Lyla grabbed her. ""Leanna, you're the younger brother's wife. You should go and check!""

Not wanting to spark gossip, she threw on a coat and hurried to the hospital.

The sharp scent of disinfectant in the corridor stung her eyes.

Brenton was pacing nervously and looked startled when he noticed her.

""What are you doing here?""

Leanna forced a smile. ""As the younger brother's wife, I should be here to check on her.""

Just then, the operating room door opened, and the doctor walked out.

""No worries. Your wife is fine. She's pregnant. Just be more careful during intimacy...""

**Chapter 2**

Leanna stood in the hospital hallway, a buzzing noise filling her ears.

The doctor's words, ""She's pregnant,"" hit her like a heavy blow.

Her eyes instinctively turned to Brenton, who looked shocked at first, but then joy filled his eyes. He whispered, ""That's wonderful... Everything is falling back into place.""

She understood what he meant. With Crystal being pregnant, he could finally leave behind his ""Dylan"" persona and return to her.

But she no longer needed him.

The doctor's voice cut through her thoughts, ""However, the patient is somewhat anemic and needs a blood transfusion.""

Brenton immediately rolled up his sleeves, but the doctor stopped him. ""Your blood type isn't compatible. We need type B blood.""

Leanna had type B blood.

Brenton looked at Leanna, hesitated, and then approached her. ""Leanna, Crystal is pregnant, and we've been hoping for this child for a long time,"" he said, pausing. ""Could you please donate some blood to her? I promise I'll make it up to you once the baby is born.""

""Compensation?"" Leanna scoffed to herself.

Was his idea of compensation really just returning to her side as if he were doing her a favor?

""I can donate the blood, but there's no need for compensation,"" she stated calmly, then turned to follow the nurse for the blood draw.

As the needle pierced her vein, she watched her bright red blood fill the bag.

Soon, her blood would flow into another woman's body to nurture their child.

Over the next few days, Leanna rested at home.

Looking out the window, she noticed that Brenton no longer went to the office. Instead, he traveled back and forth each day between home and the hospital.

Brenton, whose gaze was usually cold and stern, couldn't hide the smile on his face as he handed out pastries to the neighbors. ""Crystal is pregnant. Have some.""

""Congratulations! Congratulations!""

""Finally, you're going to have a child!""

He responded with a smile, and the joy of becoming a father was evident in every expression.

Finally, he walked up to Leanna. His hand hesitated a little. ""Leanna...""

""Congratulations, Dylan,"" she accepted the pastries and smiled politely. ""I wish your family of three a happy and fulfilling life.""

Brenton frowned slightly, almost imperceptibly.

Such a blessing was too proper, so proper that it made him feel uneasy.

Ever since ""Brenton's sacrifice"", Leanna had either been crying or causing a scene. When had she ever been this calm?

But before he could think more, Crystal walked over and took his arm, saying in a sweet voice, ""Dylan, didn't we agree to invite Leanna to dinner?""

To show her appreciation for Leanna's blood donation, Crystal insisted on treating her to a meal.

Despite Leanna's repeated refusals, she was eventually persuaded into the car.

When they arrived, the waitress greeted them warmly, saying, ""Welcome!""

She glanced between Brenton and Crystal, then smiled and remarked, ""You two make a wonderful couple!""

The waitress turned to Leanna and commented, ""This must be your younger sister, right? She's quite beautiful.""

Brenton was momentarily stunned, but before he could react, Leanna softly replied, ""Yes, I'm his younger sister.""

Her words felt like a knife to his heart.

However, as he noticed Crystal's slightly rounded belly, he chose not to correct her.

**Chapter 3**

While ordering food, he expertly rattled off a list of dishes. ""With less oil and salt. She's expecting...""

Only when the waiter asked, ""What would your sister like?"" did he pause and glance at Leanna.

""Anything's fine with me,"" she replied, lowering her head to sip her coffee, the steam obscuring her eyes and brows.

As the meal was served, Leanna absentmindedly picked at her salad.

It was only when her throat suddenly constricted that she realized the salad contained peanuts—she was allergic to them!

There had been a time when Brenton remembered all her dietary restrictions.

But now, he had ordered something with peanuts.

""Leanna?"" Crystal noticed something was off with her skin tone. ""What's going on with you?""

Only then did Brenton glance up. Seeing her flushed face, he abruptly stood. ""Did you eat peanuts?""

Leanna struggled more and more to breathe, and her vision began to blur.

In a haze, she saw Brenton rushing toward her, but he was halted midway by Crystal's agonized cry. ""Ah... My stomach hurts so much...""

Time seemed to stand still at that moment.

She watched Brenton freeze, torn between her and Crystal.

Ultimately, he picked up Crystal and, before leaving, urgently instructed the waiter, ""Please take my sister to the hospital.""

""Ma'am? Ma'am!"" The waiter's frantic shouts became increasingly faint as Leanna's consciousness slipped away, and she eventually lost consciousness.

The sharp odor of disinfectant pricked Leanna's eyes.

Upon opening them, she saw a nurse replacing the IV bottle.

""You're awake?"" the nurse said with a relieved sigh. ""Luckily, the waiter from the restaurant got you here quickly. Allergic reactions can be very dangerous.""

Leanna tried to speak but discovered her throat ached immensely.

The image of Brenton leaving without a second thought, carrying Crystal, replayed in her mind.

She shut her eyes, allowing tears to trickle down to her temples.

During the three days Leanna spent in the hospital, she lay alone in her bed. The allergy-induced rashes made her entire body itch, and her throat was so swollen that she couldn't even swallow water.

At her most uncomfortable moments, she overheard the nurses whispering outside her door.

""The pregnant woman in Room 308 is just experiencing frequent fetal movements, and her husband is incredibly anxious.""

""It's not like the patient in Room 302. She's suffering from a severe allergic reaction, yet her husband hasn't even visited her. It's as if he's gone...""

Leanna buried her face in the pillow.

Yes, her husband had been gone for some time.

He died in a car accident three months ago, and at the moment he chose to become someone else's husband.

When Leanna was discharged from the hospital, the sun was shining brightly.

As she reached the hospital entrance, she suddenly spotted that familiar jeep.

The following moment, Crystal emerged from the hospital's main entrance.

The car door swung open with a loud ""bang!"", then Brenton hurried over in two quick steps, gently supporting her waist. ""Take it easy. The doctor advised you to get more rest...""

His voice was tender, reminiscent of how he used to comfort her in the past.

Leanna remained standing as the jeep drove off, the exhaust fumes wafting onto her pale face.

He didn't even glance in her direction.

\*\*\*

The evening breeze was chilly as Leanna pushed open her house door. From afar, she noticed a tall figure at her doorstep.

Brenton stood there, clutching multiple bottles of supplements.

""Leanna,"" he called out, hurrying toward her. ""Is your allergy improving?""

""How ironic,"" she thought.

He ignored her all day, but now, with no one else around, he was acting concerned.

""Thank you for your concern. I'm doing much better,"" she replied, attempting to sidestep him to unlock the door.

Brenton grabbed her wrist. ""Take these...""

""There's no need...""

Crystal burst into the yard with tears streaming down her face. ""Dylan! Something's wrong! I've been reported for smuggling!""

Leanna felt Brenton's hand tense up suddenly.

""What did you just say?"" His voice turned icy.

Crystal was sobbing so intensely that her face was wet with tears. ""I only wanted to make more money to buy clothes... Now they're coming to arrest me...""

Brenton's forehead veins stood out. ""Why would you do something like that?""

""I..."" Crystal pulled at his sleeve, stomping her feet. ""What are we going to do now? I'm pregnant and can't go to jail.""

At that moment, the courtyard door was kicked open, and three people rushed in.

""Crystal Harrell, you're being reported for smuggling. Please come with us.""

The atmosphere turned icy in an instant.

Brenton was silent for what felt like ages before he finally spoke up, ""It's not her.""

Everyone's attention was riveted on him.

The tension lingered for a few moments before he continued, enunciating clearly, ""I know about this. Crystal didn't do it. It was... Leanna.""

Time seemed to freeze at that moment.

""What did you say?"" Leanna's voice quivered. ""Repeat that. Who was it?""

He avoided her gaze, swallowing hard. ""It was Leanna!""

Leanna's voice wavered as she attempted to speak again, but court officials had already taken hold of her arm. ""There are witnesses identifying you. Please cooperate with the investigation!""

As she was ushered into the police car, Leanna locked her gaze on Brenton.

He stood protectively in front of Crystal, yet he no longer resembled the man she once remembered.

**Chapter 4**

In the dimly lit room, Leanna's protests of innocence went unheard.

""How can it be false when your own relative pointed you out?"" The officer forcefully placed a pen before her. ""Admit the truth!""

After three days without food or water, Leanna was thrown into jail.

The prison was cold, damp, and grim. She was worn out and terrified.

""Leanna!""

Was she hallucinating? The man who had left her was now rushing toward her frantically.

""I'm sorry... I'm sorry...""

As Brenton carried her away, his voice trembled uncontrollably. He repeated her name over and over.

""Crystal is expecting and can't handle this ordeal... I had to put the blame on you. Leanna, I was compelled to do it. I feel more agony than you do. I'll bring you home once the baby arrives... Please wake up... I can't live without you...""

Leanna felt an urge to laugh.

He always had this habit—scolding her first, then softening with kindness.

The last thing she remembered before blacking out was the sensation of Brenton's tears on her face.

When she regained consciousness, the hospital room was silent.

Brenton was asleep with his head resting on the bed's edge, and his chin was covered in dark stubble.

The moment Leanna stirred slightly, he awoke at once. ""Leanna!""

He wrapped her in a tight embrace and, with tearful eyes, kissed her fervently. ""You're awake. Thank God...""

""Dylan,"" Leanna shoved him away with all her might. ""What on earth are you doing?""

**Chapter 5**

The next day, just as the sky was beginning to lighten, the sound of a car starting up came from the courtyard.

Leanna opened her eyes. As she listened to Brenton's car gradually drive away, she was just about to heave a sigh of relief when the door suddenly burst open!

A slap landed heavily on her face, stinging painfully.

Crystal stood by the bedside, her eyes filled with resentment and venom. ""Leanna, you're really despicable! Since your man is dead, you're here to seduce Dylan?""

""What nonsense are you talking about?""

Leanna covered her face, but in the next instant, she understood. It was what happened last night.

How absurd. Brenton was legally married to her, with a marriage certificate to prove it, yet their closeness was being misconstrued by another woman as an affair.

""You're mistaken. Last night, it was him...""

""Shut up!"" Crystal abruptly knocked the candles off the bedside table onto the floor. ""Don't think you can allure someone else's husband just because you're somewhat attractive. Today, I'll show you who truly matters to him!""

The flames quickly engulfed the curtain, spreading rapidly.

""Are you out of your mind?"" Leanna leaped out of bed, ready to flee, but Crystal gripped her wrist firmly.

""What's the rush?"" Crystal taunted. ""Do you really think I'll perish with you?""

She leaned into Leanna's ear and whispered icily, ""I had someone call Dylan before I arrived. Tell me, who do you think he'll rescue first?""

The thick smoke made Leanna's eyes water uncontrollably. She fought to free herself but heard the sound of hurried footsteps beyond the door.

""Crystal! Leanna!""

As Brenton burst into the flaming room, Leanna had a fleeting memory of their wedding night. He had held her close and promised, ""Leanna, no matter what, you will always be my top priority.""

But the truth was, he didn't even glance her way. Instead, he scooped up Crystal and dashed out.

""Brenton..."" Leanna called out, reaching for him, but a falling beam blocked her path.

The intense heat scorched her skin. As she collapsed, it felt like she was seeing Brenton walking toward her on the playground all over again.

\*\*\*

""Leanna? Leanna!""

The sharp scent of disinfectant filled the air as Leanna struggled to open her eyes.

Brenton sat beside her, his chin covered in dark stubble and deep shadows etched beneath his eyes.

""You've just had a skin graft. Don't move,"" he advised, reaching out to steady her, but she pulled away from his touch.

""A skin graft?!"" Leanna's voice was raspy, disbelief evident in her tone.

Brenton frowned deeply. ""You started the fire and nearly killed Crystal. Now you've had a skin graft. Is there any reason to be so upset?""

Leanna suddenly began to laugh, tears brimming as she did. ""She said I started the fire? And just because she said it, you believed her?""

""What else should I think?"" Brenton sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose in exhaustion. ""I'm her husband. If I don't believe her, who else should I trust?""

The word ""husband"" pierced Leanna's heart like a dagger.

Leanna abruptly yanked the needle from the back of her hand. ""Then why are you here? Leave!"" she demanded.

The infusion bottle crashed to the floor, shattering. Brenton applied pressure to her bleeding hand, trying to soothe her. ""Leanna, please calm down. I understand you're upset, but just hold on for ten more months. Once the baby is born...""

""Get out!"" Leanna interrupted, hurling a pillow at him. ""I never want to see you again!""

The pillow barely grazed his shoulder, feeling light and insubstantial.

Brenton remained still, swallowing hard before finally turning to leave.

After the door clicked shut, Leanna noticed a box of her favorite toffees on the bedside table.

In a fit of anger, she threw it against the wall, the candies scattering across the floor, mirroring her shattered heart.

**Chapter 6**

The day Leanna was discharged from the hospital, the sunlight was harsh on her eyes.

As she arrived at the entrance of the family compound, she noticed Sadie standing on her toes, waving energetically. ""Leanna! I've finally been waiting for you!"" Sadie exclaimed.

""Sadie?"" Leanna said, smoothing the loose hairs around her temples.

""Mr. Madren has taken care of everything. The ship departs early tomorrow,"" Sadie whispered, pulling a ship ticket from her pocket. ""He specifically said you shouldn't bring much luggage. Everything is ready in Hawaii.""

Leanna's lips curved into a slight smile. ""To celebrate my new beginning.""

Sadie was momentarily surprised, then her face lit up. ""Yes, it's truly worth celebrating. Just leave your late husband in the past and focus on the future...""

In the eyes of everyone, Brenton had been considered dead for a long time.

He had supposedly perished in that car crash.

Only she knew the truth: he was alive and thriving in the arms of another woman.

Just as she prepared to speak, the courtyard door swung open with a loud crash.

Brenton stood there, his face dark with anger, his suit drenched in sweat, clearly having rushed back.

""I've told you, no more arranging blind dates for Leanna! I will look after her, and she won't agree to remarry either!""

Sadie was so startled that she trembled. ""But she has already...""

Leanna gently cut in, giving Sadie a meaningful glance, ""You can leave now.""

Sadie hurried out in a rush and accidentally collided with Crystal, who was coming in.

Crystal glanced up and noticed Brenton standing protectively in front of Leanna, causing her eyes to immediately flash with hostility.

\*\*\*

Late at night, as Leanna was packing her suitcase, the door swung open.

Crystal, her slightly protruding belly evident, taunted, ""Didn't you learn your lesson last time? You still have the nerve to go after Dylan?""

Leanna continued folding her clothes without looking up. ""I'm leaving tomorrow. You...""

Before she could finish, Crystal suddenly screamed and fell to the floor, clutching her stomach and crying, ""My baby!""

Almost simultaneously, Brenton burst in from outside. ""Crystal!""

He didn't even look at Leanna as he scooped Crystal up in his arms and hurried out.

Leanna stood listening to Crystal's cries and shouts echoing down the corridor, ""She pushed me... Dylan, our baby...""

Her acting was laughably bad, yet Leanna felt tears sting her eyes.

At dawn, as Leanna was leaving with her suitcase, she encountered Brenton returning, looking exhausted.

His eyes were shadowed with dark circles, his chin unshaven, and his eyes red.

""Why do you keep hurting Crystal?"" he demanded, grabbing her wrist. ""I stayed with her all night. We almost lost the baby!""

Leanna pulled away and continued walking in silence.

Brenton noticed her suitcase and asked, ""How did you know I was going to ask you to leave? You're already packed.""

Leanna paused, surprised. ""Ask me to leave?""

His handsome features were marked by fatigue, yet he spoke with a frosty tone, ""Yes. Crystal's pregnancy is delicate, and she doesn't wish to see you at the moment. You should return and stay with your parents for a while.""

Without seeking her consent, he grabbed the suitcase and stated, ""I'll drive you to the train station.""

""There's no need,"" Leanna insisted, retrieving the suitcase. ""I can manage on my own.""

Nevertheless, Brenton persistently trailed her, seemingly anxious that she might not depart. He accompanied her all the way to the train station.

""Stay at your parents' during this time. Once the baby arrives, I'll come to get you.

""I won't go in with you. Buy a ticket and go in yourself. Crystal is waiting for me to care for her in the hospital.""

After offering a few words of guidance, he swiftly turned and left.

Leanna burst into laughter.

""Brenton, you can look after your Crystal forever.""

Once the jeep vanished into the morning fog, she turned around and walked the other way.

There were cars heading to the port. Ethan was waiting for her, and a fresh start awaited.

1l1xra1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1l1xra1/thoughts_beliefs_and_convictions_what_creates/,"Thoughts, beliefs and convictions: what creates your reality?","A phrase started to circulate in New Thought circles in late 19^(th) century: “thoughts are things.” It was coined by Warren Felt Evans (1817-1889) and made popular by Prentice Mulford (1834-1891). Hundreds of books were then written about “thought-force.” In the 20^(th) century this culminated in the “Positive Thinking” movement spearheaded by popular lecturers like Vincent Norman Peale (Donald Trump was his student).

It was and still is widely believed that your thoughts create your reality. Others spoke about beliefs, which are essentially thoughts you consider to be true. Neville spoke about assumptions, which is basically a statement you believe tentatively and if you persist in it, you end up believing it fully.

**The problem is this: thoughts, beliefs, assumptions create nothing in themselves.** They have no creative power. Let’s see what the facts show. I’m never interested in mere theorizing and I don’t believe something to be true just because it is well expressed by a gifted writer or well said by a charismatic speaker. I prefer to do my own thinking and I encourage you to do the same. So the proposition is that thoughts, assumptions, beliefs create reality. Ok, let me ask you a few simple questions about your own experience: Do all your thoughts materialize? I suspect your answer is No. Did you ever assume something but it never materialized? I suspect your answer is Yes. Did you every believe something will happen and yet it didn’t happen? I suspect your answer is Yes. Did you ever go to an interview, an exam, a date, thinking failure, yet you didn’t fail? I suspect your answer is Yes. We all have such stories. These stories prove that thoughts, fears, hopes and assumptions produce nothing on their own. That’s a fact.

Some might object to the above by pointing to “persistence” being a factor. Alright. Have you ever heard a psychologist talk about their practice with patients? I have and they talk about their patients having horrible thoughts held in mind obsessively, for months or even years, yet none of those nightmare thoughts actually materialized. Clearly they’re “persisting” in it, they’re “living in the end” of something bad, but nothing terrible happens in reality. Persistence is not a guarantee either.

I will make the following proposition today: **nothing that takes place at the surface level of the mind has any effect on reality**. No surface thoughts, no surface assumptions, and no surface beliefs, be they positive or negative, have any power to re-shape circumstances. The only power to shift reality lies in the subconscious mind. What Neville calls imagination is the faculty of producing images as a way of impressing the subconscious mind with scenarios presented for reproduction in physical reality. Any other technique you use has the same objective whether you realize it or not.

**Reaching the subconscious mind or controlling what gains access into the subconscious mind is the central task of what we call ""manifesting"" and it is a very difficult one.** We don't really understand very well how to do this thing, we cannot really tell when the subconscious has been impressed, and there's no clear rule we're aware of in regards to what it takes or how long to accomplish that.

A highly intense emotion produced by an event or a situation can create a deep subconscious impression. If you don’t process that emotion at the conscious level, it becomes repressed. Repetition done in a deliberate manner and with intensity can also impress the subconscious. Intellectual realization of universal truths (e.g. You are God) can open the door to the subconscious because the reasoning mind is less resistant. Meditation, contemplation and solitude can also increase your familiarity with your subconsciousness. The subconscious is not reached by mere opinions, thoughts and beliefs. It is reached by firm convictions your mind does not question.

The problem is that the reasoning mind develops firm convictions based on what the senses confirm. If my bank account is empty, it is very easy to develop the conviction of financial hardship. The consciousness of abundance relies on nothing on the exterior. I can only develop it if my mind relies on the operation of a Law that can make it happen.

So you must believe firmly in the Law to be able to form convictions unrelated to external facts. Through whatever method available to you, you must transfer that conviction to the subconscious mind. Only then reality will be changed. When you imagine getting free coffee and you do get it, that means you impressed your subconscious. Sometimes it takes seconds to do it. I’ve done it a hundred times with small things, so I know it’s not difficult to make that impression when there's little opposition. But your reasoning mind must not fight it and that’s the key.",3,1748908875.0,TRUE_Neville_Goddard,0,1.0,False

1l1xqwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BayAreaHomes/comments/1l1xqwb/sale_closed_in_san_jose_25_million_for_a/,Sale closed in San Jose: $2.5 million for a three-bedroom home,"San Jose just posted another eye‐popping sale: a three‐bedroom, two‐bathroom home went under contract in early May and closed last week at $2.5 million. Nestled in the city’s southern Willow Glen neighborhood, the 1,650-square-foot property landed well above both the city’s median sale price and recent comps in the area. The transaction highlights how even modest‐sized houses in established San Jose enclaves continue to fetch premium dollar.

Built in the mid-1950s, the single­-story home was updated over the past decade with a modern kitchen, recessed lighting, and dual-pane windows, but still retains original hardwood floors and slender Tudor-style trim. The quarter-acre lot sits on a quiet, tree-lined street just blocks from neighborhood coffee shops and the popular Lincoln Avenue shopping district. Buyers reportedly competed with at least four offers, a common scenario these days as inventory remains tight.

This sale price of $2.5 million significantly outpaces the broader San Jose median of roughly $1.3 million, according to recent Bay Area sales data. Even in sought-after Willow Glen, three-bedroom homes typically change hands closer to $1.8 million–$2.2 million, suggesting this particular house’s location and updates gave it an edge. Experts point to strong buyer demand from mid-career tech workers willing to pay up to avoid longer commutes.

Financing details remain private, though insiders say the winning offer was likely all-cash, putting it in line with the growing share of cash deals in Santa Clara County. With interest rates hovering around 6.5 percent, cash buyers have clearly retained an advantage, particularly in competitive bidding situations. Mortgage‐dependent purchasers are often sidelined by appraisal gaps when homes sell well above list price.

On the city level, San Jose’s housing stock remains underbuilt compared to job growth. While recently approved zoning reforms aim to add more density around light-rail corridors, these changes won’t deliver thousands of new units overnight. In the meantime, homebuyers are scooping up anything move-in ready, driving prices higher for existing product. That dynamic appears to be shaping every corner of the market, from entry-level bungalows to larger family homes.

Looking ahead, most analysts expect San Jose prices to remain elevated through the summer, though a slight cooldown may follow if mortgage rates inch further upward. For now, sellers in established neighborhoods can expect to field multiple bids—sometimes well over asking—especially on homes with turnkey renovations. Buyers, meanwhile, are bracing for continued competition in a market where $2.5 million for a three-bedroom no longer raises eyebrows.

I'm realizing as I'm halfway through writing this that there will definitely need to be a part 3. This part will talk almost exclusively about the filmmaking process I briefly mentioned last time. This part is less creepy weird shit, but will tell you all the primary reason why I hold such a fervent disdain for Redbeard.

Picking up where we left off last time, Redbeard and I are now set to begin shooting for our independent movie. We agreed to meet one final time on the last day before we're supposed to start, just to make sure everything was in order and set to run smoothly.

On my end, everything was great. I was in charge of things like making a shooting schedule, handling the budget/fundraising, communicating with everyone and figuring out a meticulous plan to work around the conflicts of an in retrospect much too large cast of 10 main characters. It took a lot of work, but I was proud of it, and we were set to finish shooting our feature length film in just 13 days so long as we stick to my schedule.

On Redbeard's end...he thought it'd be appropriate to wait until the very last day before we start to tell me he's basically gotten nothing done. He had really important responsibilities such as, you know, getting film equipment and finding a crew. We'd also split up responsibilities on things like making a shot list (We didn't have a DP) and securing locations. The only things he did manage to do was cast actors and make a shot list (because I was there with him to help).

I was on the verge of losing my shit upon hearing we didn't have crew or equipment. But he guilted me out of blowing up at him, using his mental health as an excuse to not do anything. I do know he was in a genuinely bad mental state, but that didn't stop him from telling me he didn't need help until the day before we were supposed to start.

The part that pissed me off the most was that after telling me all this, he straight-faced looks me in the eyes and goes ""We need to figure something out, fast."" BITCH, WHO THE FUCK IS WE??? I did my work, and now I gotta do yours too. I knew if I trusted him with handling something last minute, it would likely not get done. So I took a deep breath, said ""It's fine"" through gritted teeth, and immediately got to work.

I went online and express ordered film equipment, blowing most of the budget. The rest of it I had called in my friend who we'll call Jade, who ended up being my rock and my mvp throughout this entire shitty filmmaking process. She came in clutch, giving us a camera, a shotgun mic, an audio recorder, and 2 barndoor lights from her garage. As far as crew, I called damn near everyone I knew, whether they have film experience or not. We needed people, and fast.

Crazy thing is, it's hard to find a group of people available for 13 specifically tailored days and times, so my perfect schedule that I was under the impression Redbeard shared with ""the people he was talking to"" was rendered null and void. That said, we (or at least I) still tried to do everything in our power to stick to the schedule.

First day of shooting rolls around, and I immediately notice a problem. This should be a simple first day. It's just me and redbeard on crew, with 3 small scenes to get through and 3 actors called that day. I start setting up lights and sound stuff, leaving Redbeard to set up the camera. While I was setting up, he comes up to me, and asks that I do it for him. I wouldn't be upset at this normally bc it is someone else's camera, except for the fact that he said his specialty that he's been learning about in school is camera operation and photography direction. Bitch, you spent all this time allegedly studying cameras, figure it out! He couldn't even find the bright red record button.

I sighed and set up the camera for him, helping him what was supposedly ""his specialty."" I didn't know how to do it at first either, but I figured it out while he chatted up the actors about nonsense. Then I went back and set up the cameras and the lights. Everything was set up, but Redbeard still turned and asked where to put the camera. My brother in christ, I DON'T KNOW! IT IS YOUR MOVIE! YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR, DIRECT YOUR FUCKING MOVIE. I was dumbfounded, but I bit my tongue and directed the director.

After every single shot going forward, Redbeard would always turn to me and ask me to help him do his job. Every. Single. Shot. What my job should have been is me keeping everyone on schedule, making sure the crew and actors all know what they're doing, and occasionally reminding the director of what shots are next SO HE CAN SET IT UP HIMSELF. Instead, I was always doing the work of 6 people. I had to set up lights, set up and record sound, change the setting around, drive and transport equipment, set props, direct the actors, and direct the director. All jobs that should be done by the film crew that we don't have. All while Redbeard does nothing but occasionally ask an actor to stand in a certain spot. Thanks, Redbeard.

I love making plays and films, but the 13 days we spent shooting damn near sucked any joy I had for filmmaking right out. It had its fun moments, it was a satirical comedy script after all, but it all proved to be way too much.

Another regular thing Redbeard would do throughout filming that really pissed me off is that half of the time, he wasn't even there. He'd always show up late for filming anywhere that wasn't his house, and he'd always tell me some bullshit on the day of as to why he needs to leave halfway through. But 4 days in, he hit me with this:

""Hey OP, just so you know, I signed up to audition for a show that will run for the summer time. I know it'll interfere with filming and it means I'll miss a lot, but it's my absolute favorite show! I can't miss an opportunity to be a part of it. I'll be here for an hour, after that you're in charge.""

This got to me. I had to give up on so many summer plans to fit with the schedule of filming, and this motherfucker waltzes in and essentially goes 'Fuck you, fuck the movie, I'm gonna make you do everything.' I tried really hard to dissuade him from doing this, but the best I could do is make him promise to keep the film as his #1 priority. Apromise he didn't keep of course, because from this point onward, he'd consistently miss huge chunks of filming to go rehearse for this other show.

All of this combined led to me overworking myself beyond what I was capable of. I had some friends come in to help on crew, and they were a huge help to me. I still had to essentially do everything, but there was no expectation that these friends know what they're doing, seeing as they had no prior experience. That said, they provided significantly more help than redbeard ever did. They followed direction, picked things up quickly, and had really strong work ethics. But unfortunately, it wasn't enough. By the end of the 13 days, we only had like 25% of the movie done.

I was crashing the fuck out. I don't remember a single day where we actually stuck to the schedule. If Redbeard just did his job and didn't mess with my carefully planned out schedule, we'd have been done. But it was always ""Redbeard had to leave"" or ""Redbeard forgot an important piece of equipment"" or ""Redbeard didn't secure a location and waited until the day of to say anything."" That's I think what pissed me off the most, the way he would wait until we were on-site, day of, about to shoot before saying he forgot/didn't do something important. Every single time this would happen, he'd blame his mental health. Every day, it was ""Sorry, it slipped my mind. I'm having a really bad day today. OP, could you go do/get it for me?""

I am a major advocate for mental health, and I really wanted to make sure everyone was having fun. This is supposed to be a fun passion project after all. But when you use mental health as an excuse to not do anything, and actively overwork those around you as a result, I lose empathy. Redbeard seems to have forgotten about my whole situation I described last time, you know, being in therapy actively getting over an abusive relationship. Oh, and don't think that just because we're working on a project he stopped being weird. He didn't.

See, normally when people complain about being rejected, they don't do it to the person that they were rejected by. In Redbeard's case, however, he would still come to me, asking for advice and giving me updates on how he handled my rejection. I did used to be his go-to person for advice about his crushes, I just didn't think that'd still apply when I was the crush. He'd continuously talk about how sad he was, and how strong his feelings for me were, and how excited he was for the end of the filming process so ""we'd both be free for him to ask me out again."" 

It was getting to be a bit too much for me, so I met with Jade over tea and told her everything. She wanted to kill him, and was really upset at how he was fully taking advantage of my empathy and work ethic to avoid responsibility. She also made a really good point about me being an abuse survivor, and how that made me more agreeable to men out of fear, and how I needed to recognize that Redbeard is not a threat. Jade helped me realize that as weird and creepy as he is, I know for a fact he would never physically hurt me. At the end of my rambling, she gave me really good advice: ""He's clearly not getting the hint, so you just gotta be blunt about it."" And so I was.

""Hey Redbeard, even if I'm ready to date again by the end of the filming process, I don't really view you like that. You're my friend, you've been my friend for 9 years, and that's how I see you. I don't date my friends. I'm sorry.""

He seemed crushed to hear this, but he poutily agreed that he'd get over it. After this point we took a little 3 week break in the filming process. During this time, Jade helped me get my shit together and work out a new schedule. I used the time to prepare to lock back in while Redbeard went around to all of his friends telling them about me. He even said to me directly that he told damn near everyone he knew about how I'd rejected him. Even hitting me with ""Don't worry, I don't think you did anything wrong. Neither do any of the people I told. I'm glad you responded as maturely as you did.""

Condescending asshole.

Anyway, eventually filming picks back up. I had a whole new schedule put together, an established crew, upgraded film equipment, and I was ready to tackle this process. It was the same shit again: I'd do approximately 60% of the work, the crew would do 30%, and redbeard would do 10% (when he was there). But it was fine. I was in high spirits, we were getting things done, and I didn't care anymore that this would end up consuming my whole summer.

Part of why I was having more fun is because I'd become a more confident person who took less shit from people, especially Redbeard. I essentially took over as director, and Redbeard became my bitch for a short period of time, taking orders from me without talking back. It was honestly really cathartic after the shit he'd subjected me to. I'd taken over most of Redbeard's responsibilities, but I was stumped on one thing: locations. Redbeard insisted that he'd be able to secure a bar, a school and a coffee shop for filming. Only because I was swamped with everything else, I trusted him.

Now, I want you to take a wild guess what happened? That's right. Day of, Redbeard tells me he failed to secure the location, and we'd have to do something else.

Great. Just great.

I'd been mostly keeping high spirits throughout this, but one shooting day we had towards the end of the summer nearly made me lose my shit. This day was a really short, simple one. 2 hours, just me, redbeard, and our lead actress filming one scene. Funny side note: Redbeard's main infatuation before me was the girl who played our lead.

She'd actually just gone through a breakup at the time of our shoot. The three of us were talking about that when we first got started. Redbeard was 100% focused on the conversation, meanwhile I, as a firm believer in walking and chewing bubblegum at the same time, chimed in and listened while setting up. Redbeard wasted ZERO time asking if she had any new crushes and if she was looking for anything with anyone. He even threw in a few ""Yeah, men are the worst"" and phrases like that. What a feminist icon you are, Redbeard.

Anyway, the reason this shooting day pissed me off is because of how it actually went. See, it was my turn to be partially absent for a shoot, as I had a therapy call I'd forgotten about. This meant after an hour, it would be Redbeard running the shoot by himself. I had no expectations of course, as for the first hour it was the usual routine of me directing while Redbeard kept asking what to do next.

Eventually, an hour passed, and it was time for my call. There was still plenty of scene left, and I was fully ready to be there for an extra hour at the pace we were going. But nonetheless, I went downstairs, got some cinnamon toast crunch and complained about Redbeard to my therapist for 45 minutes. After the call, I didn't wanna walk in on them mid-shot, so I texted Redbeard ""Hey, am I good to go upstairs?"" He replied ""Yep :)"" so I went up. I walk in, and I see Redbeard and our actress on their phones doing nothing.

I was ready to lose it, no way they wasted all 45 minutes. Surely they're just taking a break? So I ask them how it's going, hoping they actually got something done. Well, Redbeard looks at me smiling and remarks ""Oh we're done. We've been done for 10 minutes.""

...Certainly not what I was expecting. At first I was really happy, as they'd worked really efficiently and got a lot done in a short amount of time. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how much that pissed me off. This guy is PERFECTLY CAPABLE of running a shoot without asking for my help. He actually has the capacity to work more efficiently than I do (Which should be expected. I'm not even a film major like him, I'm a writer). But when I'm there, he chooses to leave me with all the work. Best part? Going forward, he went right back to making me do everything.

That's it. I'm done.

Jade was right, I'm fully being taken advantage of. I decided at that point that I'd finally heed the advice of Jade, my mom and my therapist and drop the project. We'd been doing this for so long the summer was almost over, and I'd be going back to college soon. I told Redbeard that I'd stick with the project only for what was still on the schedule to be respectful of the time of our actors and crew, but after that I was dropping the project.

I'd fully let out all the emotion I'd been holding back and told him how I felt. I told him how I was fully burnt out with this and how the workload I've put up with is not anywhere near normal for an assistant director. I was doing so many jobs that should've been done by someone with the skills to do it. I had to look up YouTube tutorials to teach myself things like how to operate a sound recorder, how to do blood makeup, how to operate Jade's camera, etc. I told him how he had a whole team of people at that point who were willing to help him out, but I want to work on my own projects and focus on school, and I had to put this behind me in order to do that.

To my delight, he (initially) took it incredibly maturely and well. He agreed with me, and thanked me for my work on the project. He'd later end up insisting I should have told him I felt this way sooner (even though I did so many times), putting the blame back onto me, but I didn't care. This was such an incredibly huge weight off my shoulders.

On my last day before going back to school, I met with Jade and told her the updates. I actually ended up crying after she hugged me. I was so happy to be free of this. She was so proud, and even offered to handle working with Redbeard as a producer (strictly as a producer lol). I firmly warned that she shouldn't do that, and she was very quickly convinced to let it go. She knew how much I cared about this project, and wanted to do what she could to help me. What ended up happening is I gave Jade her equipment back, and Redbeard could only get it back if he signed a contract for it.

After this, I went to school, and I had heard nothing about the film for about a month and a half. I figured it wouldn't take too much longer since I'd essentially helped get 80% of the movie done. I even had everything left to do laid out on a series of neat Google Docs for Redbeard.

I did eventually get a text from him 2 months into school asking me for Jade's number. I FaceTime called with Jade, and yep; she's had her equipment for 2 months. My suspicions were confirmed: After I left, the whole thing fell apart. The film is not done to this day. Now, a whole year later, when anyone asks Redbeard how the film is going, he replies ""It's a sensitive subject.""

The worst part of all of it is that in the event this movie finally gets finished, I'm going to be credited as nothing more than ""Assistand Director"" and ""Co-Writer."" Redbeard won't even let me call myself the only writer because throughout the scriptwriting process, he'd give me notes. He never once typed a single word on that script, but still insisted on getting a writing credit. Whatever, I have a second copy saved for potential employers, and I just tell them I wrote and directed it myself. That or I don't bring it up at all.

But yeah, hope y'all enjoyed part 2! Sorry I didn't get to any of the really weird, juicy stories promised at the end of part 1, but hey, that gives you something to look forward to for part 3. Trust me, part 3 will have no shortage of weird shit, so don't you even worry. Stay tuned for that, coming soon :)",1,1748908387.0,neckbeardstories,0,0.67,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a bench and coffee table set requires careful consideration of several features to ensure it meets specific needs and preferences.

**Material Durability:**

The material of both the bench and the coffee table determines their resistance to wear, weather, and potential damage. High-quality materials such as solid wood (teak, cedar, or acacia), durable metal (aluminum or wrought iron), or weather-resistant synthetic materials (polywood or resin) are preferred for outdoor use. For indoor settings, upholstery can be wrapped around wooden frames. The choice of material directly impacts its lifespan and maintenance requirements. Always research wood durability and weight bearing features.**Size and Dimensions:**

the dimensions of the bench and coffee table should be proportionate to the surrounding space. A large bench and table set can overwhelm a small patio, while a small set can get lost in a vast garden. Measurements should be taken to ensure that the bench offers comfortable seating space for the intended number of users and the table provides ample surface area without obstructing movement. Before buying any furniture, make sure that the measurements are aligned with your expectations.

**Design and Style:**

The aesthetic design of the bench and coffee table should complement the existing decor and style of the space. Options range from modern and minimalist designs featuring clean lines and geometric shapes while contemporary farmhouse frequently enough incorporates natural materials and rustic charm. Mid-century modern designs blend vintage inspirations with modern functionality. The design should enhance the overall visual appeal of the area. Pick the style that is most likely to enhance the look of your home.

**Weight Capacity:**

The bench must have a sufficient weight capacity to safely accommodate the intended number of users.Weight limits should be clearly specified by the manufacturer. Exceeding the weight capacity can lead to structural damage or collapse, so it is important to consider the average and maximum weight of potential users. Also consider the long term weight bearing effects on bench.**Weather Resistance:**

For outdoor benches and coffee tables, weather resistance is a critical factor. The material should be able to withstand exposure to sunlight, rain, snow, and extreme temperatures without fading, warping, or rusting. UV-resistant finishes can protect against sun damage, while waterproof or water-resistant coatings prevent moisture damage. Regular cleaning and maintenance can further extend the lifespan of weather-resistant furniture.**Assembly and Storage:**

consider the ease of assembly when evaluating bench and coffee table sets. Sets that require complex assembly can be frustrating and time-consuming to set up.Additionally, if the bench and table need to be stored during the off-season or for protection from severe weather, consider whether they can be easily disassembled and stored compactly. Easy assembly is only valuable if the product has been assembled with high quality craftsmanship.

Key features of the Bench with Coffee Table [2025] include:

*  Durable weather-resistant materials
*  ergonomic design for comfort
*  Stylish design and aesthetic options
*  Easy assembly and maintenance

Work is usually slow during the weekdays, so I'm on here looking to chat. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for something long-term or can just be short-term. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. Also want to start making different types of bread/sourdough so if know anything about that I would like to learn. Trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASA, and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know. 

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",1,1748908082.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I of course could cut this up for the boring suburbanite market, but before I do that, I feel compelled to see if there's someone out there who would appreciate this wood in its current shape.  

I'm envisioning an epoxy + walnut table --second pic has some examples and a mockup of what this one could look like. Epoxy can be any color -- subdued matte black would make the wood the star of the table, but the table could be as loud / bright as you want.   It would be coffee table-sized.

Due to meetups with friends in Vancouver, we most likely won't be able to stay overnight in Victoria.  The plan is to take the ferry in early morning, have lunch and dinner near the gardens, and  ferry back in the evening.  
\- How far in advance should Ferry rides be reserved?  Should we book the return ticket before the day begins, or is it OK to reserve a return ride a couple hours in advance (say before we head out to dinner)?  
\- Our origin is 10 minutes from the Swartz Bay terminal, and Google Map estimates 2 hours & 50 minutes  total.  Is this realistic, including waiting to get on the ferry?  
\- Are timed entry reservations recommended for a Friday morning arrival, estimated 10-11 am?  
\- Any comments on the Coffee Shop vs. the Blue Poppy Restaurant?  We're looking for something relaxing. but not too picky about the food (Tea at the gardens is already booked up anyway).  Cold we take food to another part of the garden?   It appears there aren't any other convenient lunch places that are an easy walk, right?  
\- Any dinner recommendations in Victoria? We're not ""fancy fooders"" but ""fun food"" (different ethnicities, something varied, as well as burgers) is appreciated.  
\- Any advice on avoiding the worst traffic going back to the mainland on a Friday?  We were hoping to be done with dinner by about 6 pm, but if it's better to wait until later, we can do that.  Or if it's better to leave Victoria at 4-ish and eat on the mainland, we could do that too.  
\- If things are too harried, it's possible that we might try to book a last-minute stay at a Victoria hotel and head back in the morning.  Is this practical or ill-advised?  Cost is a consideration, but not the only one.

Really looking forward to this trip, but wishing we could do it on a Tuesday.-

1l1xfpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l1xfpr/advice_on_my_attachmentdating_approach/,Advice on My Attachment/Dating Approach,"Hey all,

So just to preface I know I can expect mixed responses to a post like this. Please bear with me :)

So I (28m) matched with a lady (29f) on a dating app and started messaging her. Right off the get-go, it was like pulling teeth to get her to respond (had to message twice), but she sent me her number and expressed the headache she had from dating apps.

I felt really drawn to her already, as this was someone I had a massive crush on in college. Almost forgot that part.

We went for coffee and she said that she ""enjoyed (my) presence and found (me) calming, and wanted to see (me) again."" I obliged and reciprocated the sentiment. This date was about two hours.

I planned another date and through this, she was texting full paragraphs and asking about me. I tried to ask questions back but I maybe didn't ask as much about her by text as she did me.

We went on a second date where I took her paddleboarding and on a hike. I was really enthusiastic about making this date good and I brought lots of things (Eg. cut strawberries, picnic blanket) for the date. Again I know this doesn’t entitle me to anything but I felt it nice and wanted to do it. We paddled around a bit and had a picnic on a beach where some deeper topics may have come up. I got the sense that she wasn't comfortable being intimate and so I didn't push anything, and I was happy to just hang out. We hiked back up and walked a lake afterwards. This date was about four hours.

I followed up the next morning by telling her I enjoyed our date. She didn't say the same back, and met me with a mid-energy text about enjoying my day. Her messages became shorter at this time as well, going from paragraphs to shorter blurbs that didn't inquire much about me. I took that as a lack of interest and left it at a ""you too!"" She sent me a youtube video later which honestly just made me confused about whether she wanted to keep talking. I opted to give her space after sending a similar ""I hope you have a good week!"" message.

I attempted to reengage with dinner plans on the friday. She told me she was feeling unwell and said she would be agreeable to a walk on the weekend instead. I sent a time, and she agreed. I sent a calendar invite (I do this to all my dates to show that I put time aside for them) and left it until the agreed upon morning.

She messaged me two hours before the walk to tell me that she was still feeling ill, and she said she would need to reschedule for when she felt better. After the communication change, the dinner plan change, and the cancellation for the walk, I estimated that her interest changed. I said I would get back to her, and when I did two hours later, I told her that I ""enjoyed spending time with her, but found that we had different communication expectations."" I told her ""I was going to take a step back from (this)."" She said ""oh okay I understand, best of luck to you."" I said ""You too"" and left it.

In between the days I wouldn't hear from her, I was anxiously waiting for a text that usually didn't come, or that would confirm that she wasn't as invested as I was. If this is abnormal behaviour or if this comes off as too needy, please let me know. I don't want to be a hindrance for someone else.

I know that this was a brief interaction, and that I maybe shouldn't be as upset about it as I am. But I have been perseverating on it for a few days, and I feel like I may continue to for a bit. I want to know if I handled things poorly, if there was something that I could have done to yield a better outcome, and how to move forward now. I think that I clearly need to work on myself if I'm this upset over such a brief exposure but I really liked this person. We had a lot in common in my eyes and I've had a crush on them since college. In a fairytale sense, it felt as though things were aligned to be good and then weren't. I know that she's busy (starting a big course soon) and probably had that stress on her plate, but I just felt so trivialized not being told that she was too stressed to talk, or that I wasn’t enough of a priority to be told that she did/didn't have a good second date. I wish I hadn't closed the door on the situation but I can't change that now. Any advice?",2,1748907954.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1l1xdw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1l1xdw9/new_tool_for_stress_hearthealth_enthusiasts_heart/,🚀 New tool for stress & heart‑health enthusiasts: Heart Rate Fragmentation,"Hi — clinical researcher & indie dev here. I just launched my very first iOS app that turns 30‑s Apple Watch ECGs into deeper insights than classic Heart Rate Variability. Here’s the skinny:

# 🧠 Why look at Heart Rate Fragmentation?

* **Heart Rate Variability =*****how much*** **your beat‑to‑beat interval wanders.**
* **Heart Rate Fragmentation =** ***how often & abruptly*** **that wander flips direction (little “jerks” in the line).**
   * Smooth pattern → flexible, low‑stress control and high adaptive flexibility between 'rest and digest' and 'fight or flight'
   * Choppy pattern → your nervous system is making rapid “course‑corrections” to steady the heartbeat—an early‑warning sign that shows up before Heart Rate Variability or resting Heart Rate usually change.

Because Heart Rate Fragmentation focuses on sub‑second dynamics, it’s far less distorted by breathing depth, posture, or mean HR.

# 🔬 Science check (human data)

|Domain|What higher HRF predicted|
|:-|:-|
||
|||
|**Atrial‑fibrillation (AF)**|**31 %**[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7847074/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\+1 SD HRF → rise in incident AF in MESA, after adjusting for CHARGE‑AF, HRV, BNP, etc.|
|**Silent coronary plaque**|[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10920038/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  Night‑time HRF independently tied to coronary‑artery calcification in the SESSA cohort.|
|**Type‑2 diabetes**|[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36529300/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  T2DM patients show significantly higher HRF even when traditional HRV looks normal.|
|**Cognitive decline**|[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8428192/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  Elevated sleep HRF predicted faster 4‑yr drop in executive function & memory.|

# 📲 What the app does

1. **30‑s ECG each morning** (pre‑coffee, reclined 30‑45°, quiet nose breathing).
   * High Precision Mode allows users the option to take multiple back to back ECGs to offer a longer measurement window.
2. On‑device pipeline computes:
   * **PIP** – overall fragmentation score.
   * **Wave patterns** (smooth, moderate, and choppy) and **Transition (Turn) patterns** (gentle and hard)
   * **VFI** – Vagal Fragmentation Index (‑2 … +2 window for stress vs recovery).
3. Auto‑graded **short-term / persistent / chronic** time trends → *Improving • Stable • Worsening* Stress vs Recovery.
4. One‑time purchase of $5.99, no ads, all data stays on your phone. Heart Rate Fragmentation CSV export for anyone who is data‑hungry.

# 🏹 Who’ll get mileage? (According to previous studies)

* **Athletes & coaches** – catch over‑reach/training sooner than Heart Rate Variability alone.
* **Metabolic‑health hackers** – watch Heart Rate Fragmentation settle as glucose control improves.
* **40‑plus preventative crowd** – extra early‑warning layer for atrial fibrillation & silent CAD.
* **Neuro‑longevity nerds** – track a heart‑brain stress link that precedes memory dips.

For the past year I've been on a weight loss journey and I've lost about 30 lbs and am still in the obese category. However, I am eating the best that I have ever been (See below for some common foods I'm eating nearly daily). I just got my labs redone and they're the worst they've honestly ever been. My LDL and Triglycerides were still extremely high and my A1C is at 5.2. My Free T4 was borderline at 0.9. My insulin is middle range of normal.

I am overwhelmed and not sure how to approach my diet anymore because it seems that something is not working. For protein I consume mostly vegetable or dairy protein and avoid beef and pork and rarely eat chicken and fish. I am eating tons of vegetables and fruit. For fats I'm not consuming any butter and only using a spritz of spray olive oil when absolutely necessary. I don't use any sauces or dressings.

Edit: I do exercise some but I definitely can do better in that category.

I am eating around 1500 calories for my deficit.

Common foods; Breakfast:

Brown rice & black beans w/ an egg and fruit

Plain oatmeal with fruit

Lunch:

Low fat greek yogurt with berries, PB Fit, and Catalina crunch

Mixed greens with chicken and fruit

Dinner:

Sweet potatoes w/ protein and brussel sprouts and/or broccoli

Brown rice & black beans or lentils w/ tofu and veggies and/or fruit

Snack:

Nuts (I do try and limit this)

Built bars

Cottage cheese

Carrot Salad

I’ve had IBS for over a decade. The kind that runs your life - gas, bloating, cramps, unpredictable diarrhea, always scouting bathrooms, always anxious.

And then, a few weeks ago, I was cleaning out the fridge and saw a tuna sandwich wrapped in wax paper. I assumed it was from earlier in the week — probably something I made and forgot about. I was hungry, tired, and not thinking clearly.

A few bites into the second half, I felt like something was wrong. This sandwich was over a month old. Like, four-and-a-half weeks, minimum. I braced myself for the impending chaos explosion.

The next morning, I made coffee and then drank it and then it happened: I had a perfect poop. like something out of a digestive health pamphlet. I mean Bristol scale level 4, textbook, no pain, no urgency, fully satisfying. A unicorn poop. Then another normal poop the next day. And the next, and still WEEKS later - no urgency or fear.

Did I shock my microbiome into order? Was it an ancient bacteria in the sandwich that colonized my intestines like probiotic Vikings? We'll never know.

All I know is:  
I accidentally ate a rotting tuna sandwich and I haven't had IBS since.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Last year I finally took the leap into nicer coffee at home. At the time I told myself that I was really just going to stick to dialing in filter coffee at home (V60, Chemex, Moka, French Press, Clever, Aeropress, etc) and that espresso would come a bit later. To that end, I got myself an Ode Gen 2 for grinding. Well, the desire to jump into home espresso onset a bit more quickly that I initially thought (which comes as no surprise at all to my partner). I have been bouncing back and forth between a nice hand grinder + manual espresso machine vs electric grinder + semi-automatic machine or even some combination of the two.

Location: United States

Preferred drink types: Would be primarily straight espresso for me (primary user) and definitely the occasional milk drink, e.g. cortado, latte for myself and my partner. Most often this will be used just for ourselves and occasional guests. I much prefer lighter roasts whereas my partner tends to prefer medium to dark, so, you know, the whole spectrum is appreciated here, ha.

Drink frequency: Right now I do more of my ""high end"" coffee making on my 3-day weekends and we typically lean into a batch brewer during the week (grinds a-la-minute, conical, a bit older but gets the job done). I could see myself getting into making a more shot or two before heading off to work in the future (for sure in the beginning because I will probably be so enamored with it).

Space: We are definitely a bit more limited in this department with our current arrangements and how things are laid out and set up. This is what has me thinking about something a bit on the ""smaller"" end or something that is not as burdensome to move may be more beneficial for the way things are currently arranged. There is a world, that I have briefly explored before, of setting up a dedicated coffee bar that could provide more space, but that is not how things are now.

Experience: As per the title, when it comes to making espresso, none other than when I was pulling shots for a few+ months working as a barista at a local coffee shop (they were the ones to teach me). That was back in late 2019 through early 2020. If you can call it experience, I've taken a lot of notes and watched a lot of videos from James Hoffman, Lance Hedrick, etc.

Candidates:

Grinder

\-For the hand grinder, I am thinking about K or J-Ultra (leaning more K for it's utility in filter versus the J so I can bring it traveling with me, perhaps, to make whatever type of coffee is accessible). The OE Lido OG, Kinu M47, and K6 are also on my radar. I know grinding for espresso this way is hard, but that is not that off-putting for now to me (he maybe says naively).

\- On the electric side, the Baratza ESP I know is pretty good value for money and has great customer service, but I am afraid of the noise (which is indeed a pretty high ranking consideration for me). I almost bought a Timemore Sculptor 064s initially when looking into things, so that's still on the table. Then there are the Turin's (DF54, 64v2)

Espresso Machine

\- On the manual side: ROK Espresso GC, the Robot (if it ever becomes available again), Flair 58 v2 (though did I spy a v3 about to pop up?). Update: I also just found out about just the Pro series from Flair which seems a great option too.

\- On the electric side: De'Longhi ECP3420, Breville Bambino, Gaggia Classic Pro with Gaggiuino or Gaggimate. If it wasn't SO much more expensive in the US, I would be willing to break my budget for the Lelit Elizabeth, alas.

My current favored set-up right now: K-Ultra + ROK. But that is pretty light and I waffle daily.

A Letter I won't send

Dear J
  
Now that enough time has passed, I want to tell you what I’ve learned and reflected upon in the months since. 

Your love never left me. I felt your absence every single day. I felt it in every morning, in every coffee, in every social interaction, and in every breath. Despite the difficulty, I continued living my life without you. I committed to sobriety and going to therapy. I often had a lingering sense of regret that I wasn’t able to commit to this for the benefit our relationship while we still had it. 

The love we had was beautiful, special, and raw, and it changed my life. It was ours, and it will continue to be even if time passes and our feelings towards each other and the relationship change. I also know that our love could be difficult and painful. I now believe that whenever we argued, both of us just wanted to be seen and acknowledged, but we were two different souls learning how to love and understand each other. 

Somehow, somewhere along the way, when one of us expressed how we felt and the other tried to understand, the message got lost in translation. For me, when I listened, I could only hear how inadequate I was and how I had to change. I always saw it as an argument and responded accordingly, instead of seeing it as an invitation to show me how my actions hurt you. I won’t justify my actions by blaming the insecurities from my past, the way you brought up these issues, or the emotions I had. I wasn’t the person you needed me to be, and I’m sorry. I could have changed, listened, and acknowledged you, but I didn’t. 

I also want to apologize for how I treated you during the relationship, despite the hell I endured following your departure. I wasn’t honest with you or with myself, I took you for granted just as much as you took me for granted, and I put my comfort, my happiness, and my fears before your needs, vice versa. I continued to do this even after we broke up by not respecting your boundary of no contact even though you left me during a period in my life you played a direct hand in igniting; I was the fuse, you were the match. It was a difficult transition, and I’m sorry for the ways I tried to beg, bargain, guilt, or pressure you back into my life. Still hurts you never did the same.

In those moments, I didn’t understand why you left and how you could leave me with so little to hold onto. But I know that breakups are hard– it was both of our first real relationships and one of many firsts we held together. Although I held onto anger at the ways you ended the relationship, I’ve realized that you were doing what you felt was best for you and our relationship. 

In my healing journey, one of the most important lessons I learned was letting go of the illusion of control. I can’t rewrite the past or undo my mistakes. I can’t take back the ways I hurt you, even though I now understand why I did. And I can’t change how I behaved after we broke up. Every day, I have to live with the consequences of my actions. I can only acknowledge, forgive, and learn from these experiences. 

Similarly, I can’t change the way you acted. I can’t change the reality that you broke up with me or the way you did it. In the moment, and for months after, I wanted to keep trying and fix our mistakes, but you didn’t. All I can do is acknowledge the reality of our love– from the unexpected beginning to the painful end, for all of its beauty to all of its perfect imperfections. 

The final aspect I cannot control is the ending of our story. It might have already happened. We might walk our separate paths and slowly return to becoming strangers to each other– only this time, with a shared history of love. We might return to speaking terms once we’ve healed and be friendly with each other, though never once letting our defenses down again. We might try again and fail. We might grow old together and share our lives again.

I don’t know what will happen. This uncertainty is difficult to come to terms with, but it will teach me how to live in the moment. I have to learn to accept any outcome, no matter how painful or how much I want it to happen. While I can't write this to you, I'll write to the memory i have of you; the J i used to know. 

Thank you for everything. I love you. 

Leaving the apartment felt like: 
As messy as this room may look, I wish it still looked the same. I wish it was messier, I wish the pile on the floor was immovable, and the mirror was too heavy for 10 people to lift. I should have opted for the portraits on the walls to be cemented rather than nailed. I wish the vanity i always hated still needed to have the drawers pulled all the way out to realign them everyday. I wish it was just as bright there now. I wish I was still just as goofy and truly smile like that again one day. I wish the things you can't see were still there despite me wishing they never were. I wish i was still 15lbs heavier, maybe then it would be harder to push me aside. I can wish a million times but a wish, by definition, is just a desire that is not easily attainable; something that cannot or probably will not happen. I wish i didn't feel as overused as a word that's been coined dozens of times to describe the paradox of the world i've been living in. Nobody's given the guidelines on how to live life properly; we learn to walk by falling... what a contradiction. Perhaps the only rule that's for certain is there are no rules. You create the guidelines to your life just as much as you run headfirst into guideposts. I am truly remarkable and I am one of a kind - how lucky am I to feel so deeply through the small overlooked sentiments of this home. However, I keep in mind the major difference between who I am compared to these tender memories - they are replaceable.

Hopefully one day they will simply fix:

1. Banning browser extensions
2. Shorter time for ‘reconnecting’ 

These two things alone would stop the majority of cheating. 

The whole ‘manual check every game’ is not working. 

The estimate is that currently 1/5 chess.com games you will face someone cheating. 

Tournament players are winning $100k by cheating. 

My question is what is the reason this community is so against having better anti-cheat?

August of last year I informed the City Council that persons with severe misophonia were being discriminated against. In a letter I emailed each member of the council before the meeting that children suffering from misophonia were announcing their suicides on Reddit. I have informed four Pasadenas police—they did nothing.

However, I trust that the City Attorney complied with the state and federal mandatory reporting laws and immediately took action, since it is a crime to neglect doing so.

Please provide me proof that Pasadena’s City Attorney followed the law to protect those children.

As you know, if any of those children followed through, liability increases on the mandatory reporter who failed to immediately comply with the law. 

Also, if I discover that any City employee is working to frustrate my attempts to bring awareness to a very painful and debilitating disability, I will report them, sue them, and put it on a public record. I say this because I suspect collusion between certain police officers and the East Pasadena Peet’s Coffee that “Jim Crowed” me so as to not comply with ADA mandates.

Hopefully, this is not true, because it would be a really stupid move.",1,1748905430.0,realmisophoniatalk,0,1.0,False

Body:
Hi friends,
I’m trying to locate a unique commercial building somewhere around Melbourne’s city loop, and I hope someone here might recognize it.
Before the pandemic, I visited this place and it left a deep impression on me — not just for its coffee, but for the overall atmosphere and design. Here’s what I remember:
	•	The building’s exterior was covered in black glass curtain walls.
	•	Just outside the entrance, to the left, there was a small window for takeaway coffee orders.
	•	The lobby itself was a coffee bar — not just a side café, but a real hybrid space where the café was embedded into the structure and feel of the lobby.
	•	If you walk in the main entrance, you’ll see restrooms on the right-hand side before reaching a back door that leads into a rear alley.
	•	The interior walls and even the restroom doors were adorned with classic solid wood carvings.
	•	The bathroom faucets were solid brass, adding to a vintage, elegant vibe.
This space had a timeless charm, and I always wondered if it survived the pandemic’s impact on hospitality spaces. Sadly, I can’t recall its exact location or even which direction it faced.
If any of this rings a bell, I’d really appreciate your help.
I’m not just trying to find a coffee place — I’m trying to recover a moment from my past.
“If you know this place, please let me know—I’m trying to find a piece of my memory.”
Thank you so much!",1,1748905351.0,AustralianNostalgia,0,1.0,False
