**​Between Father and Son** 

“Did it every bother you that I loved your sister more than I did you?”  My father gave the question a casual sound, as though he was inquiring about the weather.  
   
Years later the moment remains clear in my mind—my father sitting on the edge of the hotel bed, the usual drink in his hand, looking at me slouched in a chair across the room.  He was drunk, as he usually was during one of his unexpected visits to the city where I lived.  
   
He had called asking if I would stop by his hotel.  I took a deep breath, and felt the icy caress of the forced calm that I willed into place whenever he invaded my space.  
   
Years of putting up with the dark moods that boiled up around him when he was drinking had resulted in an emotional distance—my defense against his presence.  Just don’t let yourself feel anything, I had told myself repeatedly.  
   
The thing I had learned to do was to say no—as in “no I can’t visit.”  He was my father, I couldn’t say no.  I armored myself and drove to his hotel room, accepting the drink he poured me, forcing a smile, taking a sip, and then leaving the rest of it untouched.  
   
I let the weight of his question rest in my mind for a few moments before I answered with a careful shrug, keeping that grip on my feelings.  “No, not really,” I said, doing a good job of hiding my surprise because my father had never talked about any feelings except his own.  Although I had always sensed his absence of interest in me, he had never approached the issue so directly.  
   
Years later, I can remember his lack of expression, the way he looked at me but beyond me, his mind probably fastened on thoughts I could not imagine.   
  
  
Was he considering a follow-up question or had his mind moved on?  Was he trying to force his way into the thick of emotions that separated father and son?  
   
I was tempted to ask, imitating his casual manner, if he had ever loved me at all.  But I could not find my voice and let it go.  Our conversation rolled off in directions I no longer recall.  
   
The shock of my father’s unexpected question and my sense of having confirmed the loss of a relationship that never really existed remained rock solid in my mind long after time had washed away other shapes associated with that day.  Several years later, I would ask an Al-Anon friend, “Is loneliness one of those personality defects our program talks about or is it a condition of the heart that causes other defects to flourish?”  
   
What could I do about it?  I was tired of carrying the weight.  Could I take this mountain of a memory involving my father and compress it into a manageable molehill, maybe even make it go away?  
   
The answer is yes, as I would eventually discover, but as with so many things, the answers did not arrive in gift-wrapped packages.  I found them in my regular use of Al-Anon tools.  Tools that helped me re-prioritize and put what my Sponsor saw as “accurate labels” on circumstances that had filled me with years of unexplored anger, depression, and resentments as they shaped the person I had become.  
   
“People like us to do a lousy job of accurately labeling things, “my Sponsor said.  
   
The moment came in the form of a phone call several years after that conversation in the hotel room.  I answered the phone and he did not ask whether I had time to talk, or how I was doing.  He simply started talking.  He stumbled down memory lane, remembering the embarrassment, the anger, and pain he had felt at the age of 11 or 12, more than a half century before, when his mother would send him down the street to the bar where his father was drinking.  
   
“She wanted me to persuade him to come home.”  He rambled on, asking rhetorically, “Now how was I supposed to do that?”  Didn’t she know how this tore him up and embarrassed him?  
   
I shook my head impatiently and interrupted to say there was something I had to do.   Putting the phone down without waiting for his response, I walked across the room and poured a cup of coffee.  Then I stopped, standing there staring into the distance, because a mind-churning thought had suddenly blossomed!  
   
The disease that gripped both my father and I in different ways was leap-frogging across generations.  We had been living parallel lives, drawing our thinking from a polluted pool of instincts that alcoholism had filled in the lives of parents years before either of us had been born.  
   
My father had spent years mourning his inability to control the basic dynamics of family life.  Even late in life he felt like a victim without options.  
   
What about me?  What I had was an Al-Anon program telling me how to find the truth, if I would only listen and pay attention, as I was struggling to do in that moment.  I could use it to repair my thinking, learning to respect the reality of circumstances I could not change.  My father had done the best he could with what he had.  Whatever he was or had been . . .  well, I couldn’t do anything about it.  
   
I stood there, that cup of coffee in my hand, my father waiting for me, feeling as though I had suddenly put my arms around the essence of the First Step and my inability to control attitudes that may have been several generations in the making.  
   
I returned to the phone prepared to apologize for my interruption, but my father was still talking as though he did not realize I had walked away.  I sat back to listen, happier than I had ever been to give him some time.  
   
Neither of us could undo much, but my use of the Al-Anon tools helped me realize that perhaps with his effort to ask a single question in that hotel room, he might haven making his best effort to cross the bridge that separated father and son.  I was grateful for that possibility.  
   
I had come into the Al-Anon program *not* to help myself, but to do a favor for my wife who had decided to do something about her drinking problem.  What I discovered was the Al-Anon had more for me than I could ever have imagined.

1hjfh3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/1hjfh3d/underrated_tracks/,Underrated Tracks,"Ace Attorney is incredibly consistent with its music. Every single game has absolutely banger tracks that have garnered major attention such as the pursuit and objection themes but also select character themes like The Fragrance of Dark Coffee and Great Detective of the Foggy Town. But with this post I wanted to bring attention to some of the tracks you may have disregarded or perhaps not listened to as closely as they deserve, and they are a LOT of them.

First of all, every single cross examination theme hits incredibly hard. I don't think even a single one misses and they all nail the vibe of game they're in. DD (my personal favorite track) and SOJ all have this heavy dramatic feel to them counterbalanced by their allegro versions. The original trilogy's vibe is also similar though a tad bit darker at times, while the Investigations series have far more upbeat tracks with the addition of Presto. Apollo Justice definitely has the most ominous cross examination of them all, fitting the game like a glove. Finally, TGAA have lighter instrumental tunes for the cross examination, as the witnesses in those two games are comprised of loons and wackos, and the occasional masterpiece of a dark character.

Other criminally underrated tracks include, in no particular order:

The Basics of the Case (SOJ)  
The Great Secret Trial (TGAA)  
The Solitary Coroner - Courtney Sithe (TGAA)  
I'm Fine! - Apollo Justice (DD)  
Announce the Truth (DD)  
The Man Who Masterminds the Game (AAI2)  
Courtroom Lobby (AJ)  
Happy People (SOJ)  
The Detective from the Wild West - Jake Marshall (PW:AA)  
Hotline of Fate (JFA)  
Telling the Truth (JFA)  
Samurai on a Mission - Kazuma Asogi TGAA)  
Theme of Deduction (TGAA)  
Speak up, Pup! - Shi Long Lang (AAI1)  
The Gentleman Thief - Yatagarasu (AAI1)  
I Just Want Love - Luke Atmey (T&T)  
Winning Independence - Eustace Winner (AAI2)  
The Old Bailey - Closing Argument (TGAA)  
Rival of the Great Detective - Tobias Gregson (TGAA)  
Unyielding Medium Princess - Rayfa Padma Khura'in (SOJ)  
A Painful Declaration, and a War Song - Victor Kudo (T&T)  
Je Suis L'Belle - Florent L'Belle (DD)  
Lost Messenger of the Slums - Gina Lestrade (TGAA)  
Reminiscence - The Girl with No Memories (AAI2)  
Reminiscence - Bonds Forged in Travel (TGAA)  
Mysteries Pressed in Wax - Esmeralda Tusspells (TGAA)  
Overture to Pursuit (TGAA)  
The Gate to the Truth (TGAA)  
Guardian of Khura'in - Lady Kee'ra (SOJ)

I think that should do. No doubt I am missing a few I listen to on a daily basis, but I'm sure you all can fill in some blanks and mention other underrated tracks I should give a listen to, because AA really has incredibly consistent OSTS, and I cannot wait for AA7 for more of them.",2,1734804532.0,AceAttorney,0,1.0,False

1hjffwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hjffwa/never_get_approached_in_clubs/,Never get approached in clubs,"Hi friends,

I'm a woman in my 30s who never gets approached in clubs or events, whilst most of my friends do, and it's doing a number on me because I can't figure out why. Whilst I know it isn't healthy to worry about this, it is happening so often that it is getting to me. I'm trying to figure out why it might be. I would honestly love it if it happened, especially as I would be very open to a casual thing!

My friends are definitely very attractive women, and lovely people, so I can definitely understand why men would be interested in them. However, consistently being overlooked whilst with them is messing with me a bit.

 I'm not overweight (work out 5 days a week), super careful with skincare/makeup and I try to dress in styles and colours that suit me. As an experiment I started a dating profile on a a popular dating app  (in a major city) and got 7,000 ""likes"" in one week, so there were definitely men interested in me on that platform. Then recently in desperation, I did a speed dating event in person and nearly every man present swiped ""yes"" on me at the end of the night. So, in those contexts I had some \[apparent\] interest from men. Yet in person at events and clubs I don't get approached or have men talk to me at all AT ALL, whilst my friends get approached often.

 In fact, if I receive a compliment on my appearance at the club, it is normally from another woman.

 I would really love it if a guy would approach me at a club, event or social activity, or even just to ask me out for a coffee or a drink, I feel it's a more natural place to meet than an app, but they seriously never do!

I am quite shy with the opposite sex (at first) so I am afraid to approach (especially as I never get approached myself and feel I might be rejected), but would be receptive, open and friendly to those who might start a conversation with me or approach me. I have fun when I go out and I love to dance, so I don't feel I'm intentionally giving negative energy out.

In desperation, I confided in my friend's boyfriend and asked him to tell me very frankly and in an uncensored way what might be hindering me from being approached, e.g. scowling or unapproachable body language. He said to me you are very beautiful and men are intimidated to approach you because of that and they are afraid that you will automatically reject them. I laughed because it seemed ridiculous and I thought he must be saying that just to try and make me feel better about the situation - to me this explanation doesn't make sense at all.

What might be a reasonable explanation and how could I go about managing the lack of interest/not comparing myself or even approaching men myself in the future?

  
Thanks in advance <3

1hjffau,https://www.reddit.com/r/gratitude/comments/1hjffau/spreading_holiday_gratitude/,Spreading Holiday Gratitude,"

This holiday season I want to share the joy of being greatful for all the amazing people that encompass us. A lot of people are stuck in this isolated headspace which is not inline with the holiday spirit. I belive that we should use these few cold and cozy weeks to express how grateful we are for those around us. 

Getting caught up in life and its troubles we tend to forget the importance of family and friends. Having someone to lean on when you are going through rough patches of life is a blessing some people don't have. So call up that friend/parent/cousin who helped you out in some way and just tell them how grateful you are to have them. Maybe a foreign concept to you but trust me they will appreciate it. A few nice words go a long way. Maybe they just needed to hear that.

Be grateful for the people who shared great times with you. People tend to focus on the people who are present in their bad times but what about those who helped us create good times? Those long conversations late into the night, a simple coffee to catch up on each other's lives, a Thanksgiving dinner with the whole family together, that one crazy story everybody proudly talks about or that joke that made you smile the other day. So many people forget that those small moments in time seem insignificant but are actually equally as important. 

We all have that person that we used to hang with but because of life you got seperated and don't hear much from eachother. Why not call him up and see whats he been up to. If that's to demanding why not try sending a message? Anything is good as long as you find a way to tell them you are thankful.

What I'm trying to say is reflect a little bit on your experiences this year. Notice the people that make a part of you thrive and thank them. Get in the habit of being grateful and expressing it to others. Not only does that bring you up when you're feeling down but the people around you as well. Gratefulness is a habit for your mind and soul. In modern times we often lose sight of our mental wellbeing. Taking the time to actively set aside time to be thankful and recording it truly helps out. Hope this post inspired a few people to be mindful or helped someone. Cheers, and I wish you all a happy Christmas.",1,1734804392.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False

I’ve been thinking a lot about how many people in Amsterdam struggle to find friends, which is why I wanted to start by sharing this here in this group.

With the holidays coming up next week, I know how many people are looking for ways to connect and struggle to make new friends in Amsterdam. That’s why I wanted to [re-share one of my recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1gv8996/struggling_to_find_friends_in_amsterdam_looking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) here.

I’ve been working on [PlusOnes](https://plusonesapp.com/), an app designed to help people find “plus ones” for small, meaningful activities. We’re testing the app with a small group in early January and planning to officially launch by February.

In the meantime, we’ve set up a WhatsApp group to bring people together now, and we’re organizing casual meet-ups—like walks through the Amsterdam Light Festival or grabbing a coffee. It’s been a great way to connect with others, especially now during the holiday season.

If you’d like to join us and be part of this, feel free to leave a comment or send me a DM!

\--------

I’m working on something I'm super passionate about called PlusOnes—an app designed to help people build real connections through small, meaningful activities. Anything **non dating**. 🌱

As a Dutch local myself, I know firsthand how hard it can be to meet new people in a city as busy as Amsterdam, no matter whether you’re a local or an expat. That’s why I’m creating a safe, trusted community where you can easily find a “plus one” for your activities—whether it’s someone to explore Museum Night with, join you for a Sunday run in Vondelpark, or tag along for a Saturday stroll at Noordermarkt. It’s all about connecting with people who share your interests and making those moments more fun together.

We’re close to launching an MVP of the app and plan to test it in just a few weeks. I’m looking for a small group of people who’d like to be part of this early on, test the app, and share feedback in a small Whatsapp group to help shape something truly special.

If this resonates with you and you’d love to be involved, I’d be so grateful if you left a comment or sent me a DM!

Thank you for taking the time to read this—and who knows? You might make a friend or two even before we launch. 💛

P.S. I’m happy to share more details about the app and our vision if you’re curious.",1,1734804131.0,StudyInTheNetherlands,1,1.0,False

OnStar roadside department was not willing to help tow it to the dealership, saying I didn't have an account.   This part was wild, because I just bought it a month ago, and it only has 1400 miles on it.      I went through insurance for a tow truck.      The tow truck driver had a flat bed, but because we couldn't get the vehicle into neutral he couldn't get it on the truck, and was worried about how to get it off of the truck at the dealership.    While we were trying to figure that out, (during this \~2hrs I was trying various things to get it into drive),  it did finally go into drive, but kept service transmission message on screen.       I thanked the tow truck driver and limped it to the closest chevy dealership which was about 30 minutes away.    

  
Once at the Chevy dealership, which I made just before they closed for the night,  it would not go out of drive mode...  good thing it had stop and hold on, so I could at least get out of the vehicle.    They said they had not seen this before.   They gave me an equinox EV loaner and off I went.   

A few hours after dropping it off I received an OnStar 12v battery warning, which I can only assume was the service center disconnecting the 12v battery.     I called in yesterday to check on diagnoses and they didn't have one yet,  I don't think the blazer was powering back on,  they said hopefully by Monday they will know what is wrong.  

That is where we stand as of today (12/21).     Not a great situation, but shame on me I guess for buying another Chevrolet after they left be stranded, without a rental, for 10 months earlier this year on my 2017 Volt for a bad HV battery they couldn't manufacture, and FINALLY decide to repurchase the vehicle from me late summer (2024).

# How Online Courses Make Learning to Drive Fun and Convenient for Teens

Learning to drive is an exciting milestone for teens, marking the beginning of independence and new opportunities. However, the process can sometimes feel overwhelming or tedious. This is where online driver education comes in, transforming the learning experience into something both fun and convenient. At **Get Drivers Ed**, we specialize in making driver education accessible and engaging for teens, offering online courses that fit into their busy lives while providing all the tools they need to succeed.

In this blog, we’ll explore how online courses make learning to drive enjoyable and stress-free for today’s teens.

# 1. Convenience: Learn Anytime, Anywhere

One of the biggest advantages of online driver education is the flexibility it provides. Unlike traditional classroom-based programs, online courses let teens learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

# Benefits of Online Flexibility:

* **Study Anywhere**: Whether at home, a coffee shop, or even on the go, online courses make learning location-independent.
* **No Fixed Schedule**: Teens can balance their studies with school, extracurricular activities, and social commitments.
* **Pause and Resume**: Courses like those offered by **Get Drivers Ed** allow students to pause lessons and pick up where they left off, ensuring they never feel rushed.

This flexibility not only reduces stress but also allows teens to absorb information at a pace that works best for them.

# 2. Engaging Content That Captures Attention

Gone are the days of dry textbooks and monotonous lectures. Online driver education leverages multimedia tools to create an engaging learning experience that teens actually enjoy.

# Interactive Features Include:

# 3. Affordable and Accessible for All

1hjf64u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjf64u,No word from Jenn on the girl in her fruit ‘retreat’ picture who DIED last week ,"First pic is right before the girl died, second pic is days after. 

A girl on her retreat literally just fucking died because her body couldn’t survive just eating fruit. 

Not only has she ignored that, she’s back to pushing her fruit diet and encouraging other sick girls to join her ‘healing’ fruit retreat for anorexic girls who need FOOD not fruit

Tone Deaf Records- vinyl records
Howling Pages- Graphic Novels for kids and adults
REPCHI- Chicago themed apparel, merch and gifts
Sunnyside Plants- plants, pots, and greeting cards
Old Irving Brewery & Eris- great beers/cider to go and brewery swag 
Perkolator- coffee beans

And obviously, all these places sell gift cards which is perfect for neighbors and other people who live in the hood.

1hjf5md,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1hjf5md/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_i_got_turned_on/,My girlfriend cheated on me and I got turned on ,"My girlfriend confesses to me that the new life drawing model in her studio arts class is absolutely gorgeous. I can sense in her voice that there is some desire there, something more than she's willing to admit outright. There's a lust in her voice, a longing, and beyond believing that she's hiding something, this desire turns me on. I hate to admit it, never thought it would be true of you, but I push her to keep talking about him. His body. His muscles. His ass. Even his cock. Im getting hard hearing her talk about how he was so hot, she had to go masturbate after the first class. And she even had a sex dream about him! There's no hiding my reaction now, your cock popping a massive tent in your pants. Even she can see it. ""He's much bigger than you,"" she admits, and you can't help but groan, imaging your girlfriend lusting over a big huge black cock. 
 She smirks. ""You know what else?"" she says, as you begin to stroke yourself through I pants, ""I gave him my number."" I can't believe how hot this is, hearing her talk about getting coffee, going home with him...and hooking up. My cock is out and my girlfriend is touching herself as she details all the things she did with him, all the things she did with him that she doesn't do with me. She's not being mean, just honest, but it's turning me on all the same. She tells me that im going to help, too. Help her get fucked. She kisses me, saying that she just sucked him off and I  can taste him on her lips...and you burst. I cum before you even realize what's happening, but my cock stays rock hard as my girlfriend explains all the ways you'll help her new, hung boyfriend fuck her! Getting her pussy wet, kissing her as she gets fucked...cleaning his cock off after he fucks her! I can't believe how hard this is making you, how desperately i want it, and how encouraging and sweet she's being.  She even gets a huge black dildo, the one she bought to try and approximate her new lover, and fucks her pussy so you can see how much he stretches her open.",0,1734803666.0,confessions,9,0.14,False

1hjf3ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthywomanlife/comments/1hjf3ft/all_day_slimming_tea_review_does_it_actually_work/,All Day Slimming Tea Review: Does It Actually Work?,"I've always been skeptical about weight loss miracles. But All Day Slimming Tea caught my eye. Could it really help me lose weight? I've tried many diets and exercises, so a simple tea solution seemed too good to be true. So, I decided to look into this **All Day Slimming tea review** to find out the truth.

Weight loss teas promise quick results, but they often don't deliver. The FDA doesn't approve any slimming tea for weight loss. There have also been lawsuits against companies for making false claims. Yet, the idea of a natural, easy solution is tempting. So, what makes All Day Slimming Tea stand out?

This system includes Morning Energy Tea and Evening Detox Tea. It claims to boost metabolism, reduce cravings, and help with weight management. But, with little research on slimming tea additives, I was skeptical. Let's explore what this **herbal slimming supplement** offers and if it really works.

# Key Takeaways

* All Day Slimming Tea is a two-part system for day and night use
* The FDA does not recognize slimming teas as effective for weight loss
* Limited research exists on the effectiveness of slimming tea additives
* Green tea may contain compounds that enhance fat burning during exercise
* A balanced diet and exercise are still crucial for safe, sustainable weight loss
* Caution is advised due to potential side effects and interactions with medications

# Understanding All Day Slimming Tea: A Morning and Evening Duo

All Day Slimming Tea is a unique way to manage weight. It has a Morning Energy Tea and an Evening Detox Tea. These are designed to help your body all day long.

# What Makes This Tea Different

The Morning Energy Tea boosts your metabolism and helps control hunger. It starts your day off right by reducing cravings and boosting energy. The Evening Detox Tea works on bloating, digestion, and sleep quality.

# The Philosophy Behind the Two-Tea System

This two-tea system targets weight management in different ways. The morning tea helps burn fat during the day. The evening tea cleanses and prepares for rest. It matches your body's natural cycles for better results.

# Natural Ingredients Overview

All Day Slimming Tea includes natural ingredients for weight management. These are:

* Green tea: Rich in catechins that may increase fat oxidation
* Oolong tea: Known for its metabolism-boosting properties
* Senna leaves: Often used for its mild laxative effects
* Tulsi basil: Supports overall health and may aid in stress reduction

|Tea Blend|Main Benefits|Key Ingredients|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Morning Energy Tea|Metabolism boost, Appetite control, Energy enhancement|Green tea, Oolong tea, Ginger|
|Evening Detox Tea|Bloating reduction, Improved digestion, Better sleep|Senna leaves, Licorice root, Peppermint|

All Day Slimming Tea combines natural ingredients for a full weight management plan. It supports your goals all day and night.

# The Science Behind Weight Management Tea

I've looked into the science of weight management teas, and it's fascinating. Research shows that some detox tea blends can help with weight loss. In studies, adults at risk for type 2 diabetes who drank green or Pu-erh tea lost an average of four kilograms.

The power of these teas often comes from their ingredients. Green tea and oolong tea, found in many blends, boost fat burning and energy. Garcinia Cambogia, another common ingredient, helps control hunger.

Studies found that teas with added catechins and caffeine can increase daily energy use by about 5%. That's around 430 kilojoules per day. Over three months, green tea with added extracts led to 1.3 kilograms more weight loss than without them.

>""I lost 12 pounds in four weeks with All Day Slimming Tea,"" shares Sarah from California.

While these results seem good, we must be careful with weight management teas. The FDA doesn't see them as effective for weight loss, and the science is mixed. Some teas can even have bad effects, especially if they contain illegal weight loss drugs.

Tea might help with weight management, but it's not a quick fix. Eating a balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables is still essential for good health and lasting weight control.

# Morning Energy Tea Composition and Benefits

The Morning Energy Tea in All Day Slimming Tea is a mix of natural ingredients. It's made to start your day right and boost your metabolism. I've looked into its ingredients and found they help increase energy.

# Key Active Ingredients Analysis

The Morning Tea has green tea, oolong tea, orange peel, lemongrass, ginger, and ginseng root. Each one helps with weight management and energy.

|Ingredient|Benefit|
|:-|:-|
|Green Tea|Rich in catechins, boosts metabolism|
|Oolong Tea|Reduces fat storage, increases energy expenditure|
|Ginseng Root|Enhances energy, reduces fatigue|
|Orange Peel|Aids digestion, improves nutrient absorption|

# Metabolism Boosting Properties

This tea is made to speed up your metabolism. Green tea's catechins help burn fat, and oolong tea helps with weight loss. Together, they boost your metabolism.

# Energy Enhancement Effects

The Morning Tea not only burns calories but also gives you energy for the day. Ginseng root boosts energy and fights fatigue. With green and oolong teas' natural caffeine, you get energy without the coffee jitters.

>""I feel more energized throughout the day, and my metabolism seems to be working overtime!"" - Sarah, 34

The Morning Energy Tea is a natural way to help with weight management. It keeps you energized and focused all day.

# Evening Detox Tea Components and Effects

The evening **detox tea blend** is key in the All Day Slimming Tea system. It helps with digestion, reduces bloating, and aids in relaxation before sleep.

The evening tea has a special mix of natural ingredients:

* Senna leaves
* Licorice root
* Peppermint leaves
* Fennel fruit
* Cinnamon bark

Each part of the tea has its own role in detoxing. Senna, with its laxative effect, can help with weight loss by improving bowel movements. In fact, 92% of women saw better bowel movements within 24 hours of using this tea.

Peppermint and fennel calm the digestive system. Cinnamon adds a nice taste and may help control blood sugar. Licorice root adds anti-inflammatory benefits.

>""I noticed a significant reduction in bloating after just a few days of drinking the evening detox tea. It's become an essential part of my nightly routine,"" shares a satisfied customer from Denver.

The tea's success is clear in the numbers: 88% of women felt less bloated. This shows the ingredients work together to improve digestion and comfort.

Adding this evening detox tea to your routine can lead to better digestion, less bloating, and relaxation before bed. These are all key for managing weight effectively.

# All Day Slimming Tea Review: Real Results and Evidence

I've looked into All Day Slimming Tea, a popular **weight loss tea**. It claims to help users lose up to 6 pounds a week. Let's see if these claims are backed by evidence.

# Clinical Studies and Research

There aren't many studies on All Day Slimming Tea. But, research on its ingredients is promising. Green tea boosts metabolism and fat burning. Garcinia cambogia might help with appetite and weight control.

# Customer Testimonials and Feedback

Many users have shared positive experiences with the tea. Over 18,000 customers have noticed more energy and less bloating. They like the tea's natural ingredients and how it can be used in the morning and evening. But, results can vary.

# Before and After Results

Some users have seen big changes with All Day Slimming Tea. But, it's important to be realistic. Fast weight loss might be water or waste. For lasting results, combine the tea with a healthy diet and exercise.

|Time Frame|Average Weight Loss|Notable Effects|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 Week|2-6 lbs|Increased energy, reduced bloating|
|1 Month|8-24 lbs|Improved digestion, appetite control|
|3 Months|24-72 lbs|Significant body composition changes|

All Day Slimming Tea might help with weight loss. But, it's key to have realistic goals and talk to a doctor before starting.

# Safety Considerations and Potential Side Effects

I've looked into the safety of herbal slimming supplements. It's important to know the risks before using them.

# Known Contraindications

Research shows 30% of people using herbal medicines have bad reactions. Some slimming teas have laxatives and diuretics. These can cause dehydration, muscle cramps, and heart problems.

# Recommended Usage Guidelines

Always follow the instructions when using a **herbal slimming supplement**. Taking too much can lead to addiction and harm your colon. Start with a small dose to see how your body reacts.

# Who Should Avoid This Tea

Some people should be careful or not use slimming teas at all:

* Pregnant women
* Individuals with heart conditions
* People on specific medications
* Those with a history of eating disorders

It's wise to talk to a doctor before starting any new weight loss plan. Safe weight loss comes from eating right and exercising, not just supplements.

# How to Maximize Results with All Day Slimming Tea

I've found some great ways to get the most out of All Day Slimming Tea. This **diet support beverage** is known for helping with appetite and weight. Follow these tips to boost its effects.

Start by eating a balanced diet. The morning tea, with Green Tea and Oolong Tea, works best with healthy meals. For the evening tea, with Senna Leaves and Licorice Root, eat your last meal 2 hours before bed.

Exercise regularly. The morning tea's ingredients, like Ginger and Orange Peel, work better with daily activity.

Stay hydrated. Drink lots of water to help the evening tea's detox process, with Peppermint Leaves and Fennel fruit.

|Tea Type|Key Ingredients|Best Practices|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Morning Energy Tea|Green Tea, Oolong Tea, Ginger|Drink before breakfast, follow with exercise|
|Evening Detox Tea|Senna Leaves, Licorice Root, Peppermint|Consume 2 hours after dinner, stay hydrated|

Consistency is key. Use all 30 tea bags daily for the best results. Over 18,000 customers have seen positive changes. But, keep your expectations realistic and focus on overall health.

1hjeyp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hjeyp7/narcissistic_dad/,Narcissistic dad,"Does anyone else have the most stubborn, prideful, and argumentative dad? Usually, nowadays, I don't have any issues with my dad. If he's annoying me, I'll just avoid him. But this morning, I was making coffee and noticed there was a bunch of mold in the water chamber. He's kinda a slob and doesn't notice what he's doing/doesn't care. I told him not to put tap water in my coffee machine because it's sensitive to mineral buildup. Filtered fridge water only, please. 

I'm about to take the thing into my room because he wanted to argue about it. He doesn't clean up after himself too. It feels sometimes like he makes messes on purpose right after I clean. It's impossible to tell him anything. If I want to make a point or ask him to do anything, I have to go through my mom. Then, sometimes she can't even do anything about it. I can't imagine myself doing the things he does.

 It's annoying, and he's lucky he has me as a son. Because I don't blow up about it even though it's so so frustrating. I don't even talk about it because I know it's going to turn into an argument from him. He can't talk civilly his dad didn't teach him how to work things out. 

I'm excited to move out someday. It feels like I'm living in a nursing home sometimes. When I did move out years ago and come here, the kitchen was always spotless. He magically knows how to clean or not make messes when I'm gone. But if I'm living here, I'm their maid. 

It's definitely a toxic part about living with them. My mom will assume I'm not cleaning at all if the kitchen is dirty from him. So he makes me look bad. Same with my sister when she used to live here. There's an entire new load of dishes to do every day from just him alone. He wastes electricity like crazy too.

And I can't move out at the moment it's too expensive to live alone in college. I have one or two more years of living here. I'm just keeping quiet because that's what has worked for me. Cleaning here and there, but nothing will ever be perfect. I do enough for them not to say anything to me. I'm not a butler. I have my own life, and he should respect that I'm not here to clean up every minute he splatters something on the surfaces.",1,1734803136.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1hjew18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1hjew18/i_need_advice_about_my_wife_drug_induced/,I need advice about my wife (drug induced psychosis; ayahuasca),"Hi, 

Me and my wife have been on our spiritual journey for a few years. My wife is already pretty open and sensitive to substances even coffee. 

2 years ago we had some mushrooms and she took about 0.8g, she was fine for the first few hours. Then she couldn’t control her body would run off to the garden etc. and wasn’t very verbal until it wore off in the morning. Retrospectively I feel like maybe that was a psychotic episode. But I had no idea.

Cut to this year, in October we partook in an ayahuasca ceremony with indigenous Brazilian shamans. 

We sat for 2 nights. Ceremonies started in the evening and ran through the night. After the ceremonies we got home. And the next day I guess the experience coupled with going back to work and also my dad who suffers from Parkinsons disease coming back home from visiting family for a few weeks. It was overwhelming for me and I began smoking weed again to numb myself.

Over the next few weeks, my wife began messaging people a lot, almost to the point it felt like she was spamming people with messages. She also said that she felt like she was telepathically communicating with several music artists we listen to. Her seeing synchronicities everywhere and angel numbers.

I had no idea what was happening. This went on for a few weeks I thought she was just a lot more energetic than usual. During this time her sleep was getting disturbed by the “channellings” and was sleeping a few hours a night.

The chance came to sit again with ayahuasca a month after, so in November. She was adamant that we go, and I will admit a part of me wanted to go as I felt I hadn’t made the changes in my life that I should’ve from the first ceremonies. So we sat for 1 night.

After this, things ramped up for her drastically. She started to experience “telepathy” a lot more, sleep was getting disturbed again. Communicating in emojis, several artists blocked her. She would also write in her notes app to channel, and also use the predictive text and believe that that was how they were communicating with her.


There was also a lot of denial when I would tell her that I don’t think she’s channelling as it was 1 way communication etc. her ego was also getting big, and she felt as if she had no problems to work through etc. 

We went to see a shaman for a non medicine session. And he was concerned. After the session the first thing she said was that he was projecting his insecurities on her etc. 

This slowly got worse and she began feeling like Apple and the tech companies were spying on her phone and using her notes app to manipulate her. She would watch something on tv a movie anything and feel like it was so relatable and that her life story was getting stolen from her phone and being made into content.

Last week she had her first psychotic episode, where we were at the supermarket and she felt like she was telepathically communicating to someone in the store. As we drove home, she began saying that she felt like she could hear everyone’s thoughts of the people she was channelling.

We got home and she lost it when I turned the car off and took my eyes off the road. I had to restrain her and drag her into the house. She was in a total panic or manic episode for hours. It was terrifying.

The ambulance said that they couldn’t come because they had no vehicles available. After a few hours she began to come back to reality a little. The next night she slept the whole night through. She said she felt more rested. 

Come to the evening and the thoughts were very intrusive. And she had another episode. Where I had to stop her from running outside, she was saying that the government and Apple were all outside surrounding the house etc.

My mom and I took her to the hospital, she was still in a delusional state. We were there for 2 days before being discharged for home treatment. 

We saw a psychiatrist as per hospital. And they prescribed some aripiperazole/abilify and some zopiclone for sleep and promethazine for anxiousness. 

She was initially welcome to the meds and help, but would throughout the day feel like she didn’t want them. On Thursday she took the sleeping tablets and slept for 9/10 hours. Friday she took the 5mg aripiperazole in the am and managed to get some sleep last night but it was somewhat broken.

This morning she said to me that she will have the meds today but then she wants to stop taking them. She believes that Apple and the government keep telling her that she’s mentally ill etc and that shes fine etc. 

For moments she pops back to reality and will be open to the meds, but today has been an uphill challenges. I’m a little scared of whether she will take them tomorrow or not. 

She’s only had 2 days of AP’s and says they’re not working. 

Any help or advice on how to navigate this is so helpful thank you! And thank you if you’ve read it all. Apologies for the long post, tried to condense it as much as I could ",1,1734802929.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

I’m going from being a hermit of 6 years borderline no physical fitness. I’m 5’8 175 lbs. I wouldn’t say I’m fat but sure I could lose a couple lbs. I’m trying to gain strength and lose a few lbs for basic training this year coming up. 


1 being Monday, 5 being Friday. 

I go to planet fitness so for Monday I go, warmup with a 5 minute run, normally that’s about half a mile for me. Then I go to the chest press. I do enough weight to borderline failure. But if I fail I take a few seconds and just finish it. I’ve been doing about 7 reps 4 sets. I make sure each rep is challenging weight wise. Most of the time I fail towards the end of my reps but always finish. Then I did the butterfly machine where your arms are straight back pull forward. Close off with either the bike or a mile run. 


Tuesday Biceps triceps. Open with a 5 min jog. 
Use 17.5 weights for curls. Same reps and sets. I almost fail but didn’t this week. Then I use those same weights. 7 reps 4 sets. Of lifting my arms up like a T pose.  I forget what it’s called sorry.  Then I do pushups 4 sets of 10. Finish with a mile run. 

Wednesday, 5 minute run, leg press, high weight same sets. I also spend about 15 minutes on the cycle on high levels. Absolute leg killer. Finish off with a mile run. 

Thursday , open with 5 jog. I did the ab twist machine. 10 reps 4 sets.  Did the shoulder press machine. Kept failing at 5 reps was aiming for 7. Just kept finishing it off. Starting another set. Eventually I got annoyed did another abs set and came back to do 6/7 for shoulder press. Finished on bike high level. 

Friday, open with my jog, do a couple of the back machines I forget the names, I go for high weight same types of sets. Finish on the cycle or run a mile at the end. I’m trying to increase my stamina at the moment I’m struggling to run the full half mile without stopping. 


I’m doing all this while being a lot more conscious of what I eat. I stopped drinking soda. Started drinking more quality water, and coffee here and there. 

Is this a decent routine to keep up with? I’m about to start week 2. I have someone giving me advice and tips and not that I doubt them. I would just like to know what you guys think. 

Going from no exercise at all. To this. Do you think it will make drastic changes in my physique within the next few months? Should I go harder? Should I keep this up? I would love if you guys could help me I’m really new to this. Thanks in advance! Oh by the way I’m having 2 off days working out 5.   Between my jogs and end runs I total with almost 2 miles a day.

1hjevh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Furrierist/comments/1hjevh9/potent_cannabis_oil_recipe/,Potent Cannabis Oil Recipe,"(This was originally posted by u/EdibleOnly in r/treedibles but later deleted. I'm posting it to my own account for the purpose of preserving the recipe, which is the best I've found for making cannabis oil) 

Let me start by giving some background information about myself:

I am a biochemistry student, and I love and respect cannabis greatly. For the longest time, my main method of enjoyment was through vaporizers. I would be able to enjoy the taste and potency more fully and efficiently.

Unfortunately, 8 months ago I had a spontaneous lung collapse. I was hospitalized for around 3 weeks and had to have lung surgery to prevent future collapses. I have found now that if I try vaporizing, I will experience a lot of discomfort in that lung, and being high and feeling chest pain of any sort is never fun.

Instead of giving up, I turned to a new form of using cannabis that I had only briefly explored: edibles. Fast foward 7 months and many many failed/test batches. I feel like I can safely say that I can make high quality cannabis oil by focusing on enhancing efficiency.

Even though only \~30% of the THC is processed by our bodies, it is broken down into several cannabinoid metabolites, the main one being [11-Hydroxy-THC](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11-Hydroxy-THC) which has been shown to be **4-5 times stronger** than normal THC. This is why people regularly report experiencing ""trip-like"" effects/visuals from having larger edible doses.

So here are the **essential tools and the ones I use:**

* [Coconut Oil](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.amazon.com/Nutiva-Certified-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B000GAT6NG): Coconut oil is the best choice for our cannabis edibles for several reasons. The first is that it consists of 100% saturated fat, which is exactly what is needed for cannabinoid absorption. Coconut oil also consists of \~66%[Medium-Chain Triglycerides](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride) which are the perfect size to be easily absorbed by our bodies without additional help from our bodies. For example, Long-Chain Triglycerides need to be broken down first, which takes energy.

I use the Nutiva brand mostly because it is by far the highest quality that I have been able to afford. I used to use a brand from wal-mart, and I have noticed a significant difference when I switched.

* [Crock Pot](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.walmart.com/ip/Crock-Pot-4-Quart-Slow-Cooker-Black/14922959) and Oven/Freezer Safe Tall Dish: This allows for consistent low heat, which is what we are looking for. Note: Do not put the oil directly into the crockpot unless you plan to make serious bulk. Often times using a smaller oven/freezer safe dish is much easier to handle and creates less waste. [Souffle dishes](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.amazon.com/BIA-Cordon-Blue-Souffl%C3%A9-Dish/dp/B0000DE20I) and [egg dishes](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.amazon.com/BIA-Cordon-Bleu-White-Porcelain/dp/B006H5V82Q/ref=sr_1_36?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1365000668&sr=1-36&keywords=egg+dish) for larger/smaller amounts respectively are perfect.
* [Soy Lecithin](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.amazon.com/WillPowder-Soy-Lecithin-Powder-16-Ounce/dp/B00250UC92): Soy lecithin is an emulsifier that increases the bio-availability of the final oil, which essentially means that its easier for your body to absorb it in higher quantities. This is really optional, but there is definitely a noticeable difference in potency.
* [Coffee Grinder](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://www.amazon.com/Proctor-Silex-E160BY-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B00006IUX5/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1364962223&sr=8-2&keywords=coffee+grinder) and Small Brush: Our goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible such that it nearly becomes a kief-like powder so that most of it literally dissolves into our oil. You'll need a brush to minimize waste, and it's actually very fun to meticulously brush cannabis powder into your container.
* Aluminum Foil, Sheet Pan
* Of course, our lovely friend cannabis. I'm using a half oz of the finest cannabis that I could find for this.

**Procedure:**

**1. Decarboxylation**

First we must decarboxylate our cannabis. In raw cannabis, THCa is found in much larger quantities than our friend THC, and unfortunately it is much less psychoactive than THC. This is why eating raw cannabis does not produce much of an effect unless eaten in extremely large amounts. Our goal is to remove the Carboxyl group from THCa and convert it to THC by adding a certain amount of heat. The only other way to do this is through time itself, but it takes a tremendously long amount of time.

It is a misconception that decarboxylation is unnecessary due to the heat provided once the cannabis is actually in the oil. Unfortunately, the carboxyl-groups fall off at a much slower rate once the plant matter is heating in the oil, slowing the rate of decarboxylation dramatically. This is why we decarboxylate beforehand, ensuring that most of our THCa will be converted by the end of the process.

In order to do this, break your cannabis up into small popcorn-sized nugs and place them in your oven-safe dish. You'll be using this dish for the entire process so treat it well. Preheat the oven to \~225F. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place on a sheet-tray for easy entry and removal.

Place it in the \~225F oven for 20-25 minutes, depending on how brittle the cannabis originally felt. Afterwards, allow the cannabis to naturally cool down for \~10 minutes. Then we get ready to grind.

**2. Grinding** Example Picture: [Before and After Grinding](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://imgur.com/a/CCIv2#0)

Your goal is to grind the cannabis as finely as possible. We grind after decarboxylating to ensure an even finer consistency. **I strongly recommend taking your time with this step.** It really pays off to focus on minimizing waste. There will be kief on the cover of the coffee grinder, and there will be powder in the nooks and crannies, but take the time to use your brush to get as much as you possibly can into your dish. Even if you only increase the overall potency by 2% for your work, remember that 2% is multiplied by 4-5x due to the nature of 11-Hydroxy-THC.

In the example picture, the ground up cannabis may appear to have clumps. This is from the cannabis being so finely ground that it is sticking to itself and forming temporary clumps which dissolve on contact with the oil.

**3. Adding Lecithin and Oil**

After grinding, the next step is to add your lecithin and oil. The soy lecithin depends on the ratio of the oil. I use a 3/4 **tsp** lecithin to 1 **tb**sp oil.

As for the oil, I figure out what I'm going to be using the oil for ahead of time and work from there. For example, for a batch of muffins, it takes 1/3 cup oil. Out of my half ounce of cannabis, I can make 2 7g batches of muffins, so I will add 2/3 cup oil, and use 1/3 in each batch.

**4. Processing**

Place your dish inside of the crockpot on low for 3 hours. Keep in mind that crock pots take a good \~20-25 minutes to actually get truly hot, so it is wise to turn it on before this step to allow it to pre-heat. Make sure you keep the lid on the crockpot for as long as possible to keep even heat. This will keep your oil at around \~195-210F which is what we want.

After 3 hours, remove the dish and allow it to cool for \~20 minutes, and then place it inside of the freezer for a minimum of 2 hours.

To understand why **freezing is important**, we need to visualize the plant cells within the cannabis. They are essentially globules of liquid containing cannabinoids that we want to extract. Freezing them **forces that liquid to take on a crystalline structure, piercing the plant cell walls and releasing the goodies**. This even further increases the bioavailability of our final oil.

After freezing, allow to reach room temp again for about \~15 minutes before placing back in the slow cooker. I suggest turning the slow cooker on after placing the dish back inside of it to let them slowly rise in temperature together. This lowers the risk of damaging the dish.

Heat inside the slow cooker for another 3 hours. I start the 3 hour countdown once the oil has liquidified again, as it will take about 30 minutes for it to no longer be solid.

Follow this by another 2 hour freeze. Afterwards, heat the oil again for another 3 hours and then you should have something resembling this:

[Final Oil](https://web.archive.org/web/20130618210055/http://imgur.com/bZjbsxN)

It should be **black enough to reflect the rim of the dish**, like you see in the picture. It will be slightly thicker, and extremely potent.

While straining out the plant matter, you should notice it is significantly less than what we started with.

Be extremely careful with this oil as it is very potent.

Smaller doses are also possible. I can use an eighth of cannabis and make a personal batch of potent edibles that will last me for 24 days.

It’s not like we never have dinner at other homes, we have a few close friends who understand and know what precautions must be taken.

1hjer7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BajaCaliforniaSur/comments/1hjer7m/tips_from_my_trip_to_la_paz/,Tips from my trip to La Paz,"1. Housing: We rented an Airbnb a few blocks away from the city center. We have mixed feelings about the apartment itself, but It felt safe enough to walk around at night(9-10 PM). I've only stayed near the city center and can't tell about the general safety, but I haven't seen any major problems like theft or pickpocketing. La Paz is a legit city where shops open until late.

2. eSIM: My US plan covers 0.5G per day in Mexico but I bought an Airalo eSIM just in case. Hotspot worked great. I lost connection on highways (between Cabo and La Paz) but never in the cities.

3. Cash: I didn't need pesos anywhere as I was able to do everything with credit cards, except for a museum(and they surprisingly took USD) but you could tip restaurants, cafes, or tour guides with pesos.

4. Transportation: We flew to Cabo airport, took Ecobajatours Bus to La Paz. We didn't buy the tickets in advance. From Cabo to La Paz, we had to walk 5-10 minutes to Terminal 1 and found Ecobajatours office there. It was a 12 passenger van, took about 3.5 hours after a few stops. ~700 pesos. From La Paz to Cabo, we went back to the bus terminal and purchased tickets for a direct bus to Cabo for ~400 pesos. The bus had a restroom inside. It took 3.5 hours to Cabos Walmart and we realized that it didn't go to the airport. We called Uber, took another 20 mins. I guess we could've bought bus tickets to La Paz as well but didn't bother searching more.

5. Remote work: There is a plenty of coffee shops with great wifi and people working there. Doce Cuarenta is the most popular, I also liked Paradiso right across from it.

6. Activities: We used MeXplore and  Airbnb to search activities. We did whale shark + sea lion snorkeling, scuba diving, museums, and walking tours. We had no problem without a car in the city, but we could've spent more time at the beaches reading, swimming, and just chilling... if we had a car.

7. Food: I got food poisoning from street food (lol) but I don't think it was particularly unsanitary. Traveler's diarrhea I guess. I couldn't eat much but I loved Tiger Club, Hanto, and Green & Rosse.

8. Shopping: We got cute accessories and t-shirts from local stores. For daily necessities Oxxo is everywhere (a convenient store) and you can also easily find pharmacies that are similar to CVS or Walgreens.

9. Language: I speak very basic Spanish like Duolingo level 10, but it helped. It's a touristy area, some people speak English but definitely not everyone.

10. Weather: Hot during the day but a little bit chilly at night. I took a windbreaker, long-sleeve sweatshirt and sweatpants for night.

I was an easy, safe, fun trip despite being our first ever trip to Mexico. I want to learn more about the history of the city, and think thoroughly about how the tourism can benefit locals.",4,1734802565.0,BajaCaliforniaSur,0,1.0,False

1hjeoh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DubaiJobs/comments/1hjeoh7/feeling_stuck_in_my_job_search_need_advice/,Feeling Stuck in My Job Search – Need Advice,"I’m turning to this community because I feel completely stuck and don’t know where else to go. My family and I recently moved to Dubai after my husband lost his job in the U.S. Thankfully, he found work here, but it was a sudden change, and we didn’t have a choice but to leave. The hardest part? I don’t know a single person here.

I have over 10 years of experience, with a background in strategy, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. I’ve worked for a luxury electronics AV firm, focusing on global operations and growth, and more recently, I’ve been managing stakeholder relations for a venture capital firm. I also have an undergraduate degree from an Ivy League university, so I thought my experience and education would make job hunting more manageable.

But the reality is far from that. My role in the U.S. isn’t transferable, and since moving here, I’ve applied to over 100 jobs on LinkedIn with no success. Everyone tells me I need a strong referral just to get a coffee chat or a first-round interview, but I don’t even know where to start when I don’t know anyone locally.

I know Reddit isn’t the place to ask for referrals, but I’m desperate for advice. I’m looking to join a consulting firm or a consumer goods company, ideally in operations or strategy. I’ve been tweaking my resume, writing tailored cover letters, and trying every strategy I can think of, but I feel like I’m just shouting into the void.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on breaking into these industries—especially in Dubai—I’d deeply appreciate your insights. This process has been humbling, and I’m open to learning from anyone willing to share their perspective.

My family and I recently moved to Dubai after my husband lost his job in the U.S. Thankfully, he found work here, but it was a sudden change, and we didn’t have a choice but to leave. The hardest part? I don’t know a single person here.

I have over 10 years of experience, with a background in strategy, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. I’ve worked for a luxury electronics AV firm, focusing on global operations and growth, and more recently, I’ve been managing stakeholder relations for a venture capital firm. I also have an undergraduate degree from an Ivy League university, so I thought my experience and education would make job hunting more manageable.

But the reality is far from that. My role in the U.S. isn’t transferable, and since moving here, I’ve applied to over 100 jobs on LinkedIn with no success. Everyone tells me I need a strong referral just to get a coffee chat or a first-round interview, but I don’t even know where to start when I don’t know anyone locally.

I know Reddit isn’t the place to ask for referrals, but I’m desperate for advice. I’m looking to join a consulting firm or a consumer goods company, ideally in operations or strategy. I’ve been tweaking my resume, writing tailored cover letters, and trying every strategy I can think of, but I feel like I’m just shouting into the void.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on breaking into these industries—especially in Dubai—I’d deeply appreciate your insights. This process has been humbling, and I’m open to learning from anyone willing to share their perspective.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",1,1734802104.0,dubai,1,1.0,False

I would be a week after the operation. I feel like this is a stupid question however I don't want to do anything that can compromise the graft.
 
Also, as day 4, would it be okay to drink coffee (room temperature)? Then again, I see warnings online about the hot drinks, not especially the caffeine.

Again, I just don't want to compromise the graft. Especially since I can't really see the areas and how they're healing (barrier + can't really pull my lips away, since it is not recommended)

1hjekc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountryDumb/comments/1hjekc5/the_campbells_cup_what_corporations_know_that/,The Campbell’s Cup: What Corporations Know That Employees Don’t,"For those who may struggle with mental illness, suddenly quitting bipolar medications in an effort to better hear/understand the imaginary voice inside your head, is almost guaranteed to take you to a distant Never-Never Land that neither you or your family truly want to go. And for me, this involved living in remote cave for four days, where I slept beside a pair of armadillos at night, and communed with a box turtle and a pair of screaming eagles during the day while I walked to a hidden spring for drinking water.

But despite the manic euphoria that comes with being completely secluded in nature without internet, social media, text-message pings, or the constant deluge of minute-by-minute reminders of everyday responsibilities as a father, husband, and provider, there’s also a chance for endless stillness that most people go through life without ever truly experiencing. And in this place of complete solitude—which only the unapologetic narcissism of an all-out state of psychosis can provide—there’s an artistic sadness that sometimes exists inside the subconscious as it searches for meaning and purpose without any restrictions, especially time.

And in the midst of crazy, while sitting there, butt-ass naked in the Tennessee River with soaring eagles overhead, I thought about my experience in corporate America, and the many different versions of the Campbell’s Cup, which I saw managers and executives use in order to lure employees into sacrificing their lives for some bullshit cause that always failed to scratch that familiar itch inside all of us.



**The Campbell’s Cup**

Like I said, I’ve seen a lot of versions of this over the years, but its true origin came from the hands of a group of fraternity brothers who decided to spend an entire semester gaming, as they battled each other for a storied prize that sat on the mantle above the TV. I hated gaming, but I absolutely loved watching this group of idiots fight over a homemade trophy. They got into fist fights, cussing matches, and all-out fits of rage as they raced to accumulate the most points, like some season-long NASCAR series. And the more those guys played, the more valuable the Campbell’s Cup became in the hearts and minds of each moron who dedicated their lives in its pursuit.

And on the day the winner was finally crowned, in a living room full of pissed off competitors and frienemies, I hee-hawed laughing while the champion stood on a coffee table made out of beer caps and kissed the trophy as part of his sarcastic, tear-filled acceptance speech—thanking God, Mama, and the pin-up posters of naked chicks who had helped inspire his victory.

And the worst part, was no one but me was living. Instead, every guy on the couch was jealous as hell, with a ridiculous level of video-gaming envy I can’t even begin to describe, so much so, that they were actually willing to piss away the following semester just for a chance to take back the precious prize.

But what was weird, in that very moment, what had started as a pure joke, was now a legitimate quest for a greater purpose in life. And every person there, was completely blinded by the idol’s allure.

Yes, to them, the Campbell’s Cup was indeed something to behold. Something more valuable than gold, diamonds, or a shiny-new lambo. But for any objective observer, the Campbell's Cup was nothing but a broken baseball trophy with an empty soup can bolted to the top.

 

**Naked in the Tennessee River**

You’ve got to be off your rocker to sit on a submerged gravel bar for half a day after taking an exfoliating bath with a 19^(th)\-century brick. But I did it!

And while sitting there scrubbing seed ticks off my body with a hand-carved rock, for once, I felt like I actually had time to slow down and think.

Nothing but wildlife, the woods, and acres of water surrounded me, and for once, I knew I was finally out of the day-to-day rat race, and maybe that's why I thought about the time when I was the happiest. Because when I looked across the water at a small island of flooded cypress trees and stumps, I remembered sitting there, in a boat with my father, catching crappie one afternoon after school.

https://preview.redd.it/4zxrpjlag88e1.jpg?width=623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa6a2a6932394840980450a5fa8772141c4d2759

The memory was one of my favorites, because it was one of the only times it ever happened. And while I sat there, literally looking over a landmark from my childhood, I realized the lack of time and money was what kept the two of us from returning to that same fishing hole.

Because when we did actually have a Sunday for leisure, my parents believed sitting on a church pew was more important than spending time in a boat as a family.

Church was my father's version of the Campbell’s Cup.

And as I sat there, in the water, reminiscing about lost time and missed opportunities, I realized that if I didn’t choose to dramatically alter my financial status in the world, my children were going to grow up while I was at work. And then they too, would be pissed off, wondering why they weren’t important enough for me to have taken the risks that would have allowed me to be at home or in a boat with them all those years I had spent giving my life to the damn company….

 

**Why Do You Want More?**

There’s nothing wrong with wanting to make more money, but you’ve got to make sure your ambitions have nothing to do with your own ego. Because if you don't, you'll never be able to manage risk and throttle back on your exposure when the market tilts toward exuberance. Instead, all you'll crave is more, and when more is some version of the Campbell's Cup, you're in big trouble.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, just spend five minutes people watching in corporate America. Because from the CEO, all the way down to the intern…EVERYBODY is selling their soul for the Campbell’s Cup.

And the system is designed that way!

Shit. These corporation do it on purpose, all in the name of “recognition.”

Print some trite award on a $.10 cent piece of paper with the CEO’s signature on it, and just watch how many hopeless bastards will do a cannonball into an 80-hour workweek, just for a chance to be at the center of some future grip-and-grin photo cliché.

A $20 plaque. Fancy promotion with a title on the door. Retirement cake. Commission check. 5-Star vacation for the top salesperson…. By god, you dangle a big-enough carrot on a stick, and even the CEO will bite. But when it’s all said and done, every one of those folks will be the very ones who’ll go to their deathbeds with regret.

Turn on CNBC, and you’ll see plenty of million-dollar executives with fine suits and forgotten children who won’t even come home for the holidays. And that’s the main takeaway I walked with after after my long soak in the Tennessee River.

Because it doesn’t matter what a person accomplishes in their “career,” if their own kids grow up to hate them.

And that’s the beauty of being the everyday wage earner who clocks in and clocks out for a living. If they're smart and don't get caught up in the ritual of it all, but instead use their labor as a means to acquire seed capital.... There's nothing to stop that person from investing his/her “recognition” every two weeks and delaying gratification while they wait patiently for the day they have the financial freedom to tell their boss to go to hell.

Because here's a fun fact about growing a ROTH to $2M by the time you’re 40. 

At some point, all those tax-free gains will compound over and over again, until the earnings generated by the retired Little Guy—who refused to kiss ass all those years—actually out earns the CEO who’s still chained to his job as an overly compensated W2 employee.

And how fun would that story be to tell your kids...while you’re sitting there in boat...in the middle of a lake... just spending time with the people you love the most?

Water plays a vital role in our overall health and well-being. It is essential for numerous bodily functions and impacts everything from digestion to cognitive performance. Staying hydrated should be a priority for everyone, yet many people do not recognize the importance of drinking enough water. Understanding how hydration benefits your health can motivate you to drink more water daily.

### Why Hydration Matters

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water each person needs can vary based on several factors, including age, weight, activity level, and climate. A common recommendation is to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, you may need more if you are physically active or live in a hot climate. Here are some tips for ensuring you stay hydrated:

- **Carry a water bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you to encourage regular sipping throughout your day.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone or a hydration app to remind you to drink water regularly.

The Role of Water in Skin Health and Appearance
-----------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but its role extends far beyond basic hydration. One of the most notable benefits of adequate water intake is its impact on skin health and appearance. Your skin, being the largest organ of your body, requires proper hydration to function optimally. When you drink enough water, you provide your skin with crucial moisture and nutrients that can result in a youthful and vibrant complexion.

### Why Hydration Matters

When your body is dehydrated, your skin lacks moisture. This can lead to a host of issues, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Dryness:** Dehydrated skin often feels tight and rough, which can make it look dull.
- **Increased Wrinkles:** Lack of moisture can cause premature aging and make fine lines more noticeable.
- **Increased Sensitivity:** When skin is dry, it can become more prone to irritation and flare-ups.
- **Pore Appearance:** Dehydrated skin can lead to enlarged pores, making them more noticeable.

By drinking sufficient water, you help maintain your skin's elasticity and overall structure, which contributes to a healthy appearance. Hydration helps your skin cells function better and can significantly improve your skin's texture.

### How Water Affects Skin Appearance

Drinking enough water can visibly enhance your skin in several ways:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Boosts Elasticity:** Proper hydration helps skin maintain its elasticity. Hydrated skin is less likely to sag and more likely to bounce back when stretched.
- **Promotes Healing:** Water aids in the healing process of wounds and blemishes. Staying hydrated can help accelerate recovery from acne or other skin issues.
- **Provides a Healthy Glow:** Well-hydrated skin emits a natural glow, making you look more youthful and vibrant.
- **Reduces Puffiness:** Adequate hydration can minimize the appearance of puffiness, particularly around the eyes.

### Daily Water Intake Recommendations

The amount of water you need can vary based on factors like age, activity level, and overall health. However, a general guideline is to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, known as the ""8x8 rule."" Here are some additional tips to help you stay on track:

- **Carry a water bottle:** Having water on hand encourages you to drink more throughout the day.
- **Set reminders:** Use your phone to set periodic reminders to drink water.
- **Infuse your water:** If plain water bores you, try adding slices of citrus, berries, or cucumber for flavor.
- **Drink before meals:** Having a glass of water before meals can help you stay hydrated and may even assist in digestion.

### Additional Benefits Beyond Hydration

Water does more for your skin than just hydrate it. It plays a crucial role in overall health, which can indirectly affect your complexion. Consider these benefits:

- **Detoxification:** Drinking water aids in flushing out toxins which can lead to breakouts or dull skin.
- **Improved Circulation:** Good hydration supports healthy blood flow, delivering essential nutrients to the skin.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Water helps regulate body temperature, which is vital for skin health during hot weather.

Water into your daily routine is a simple yet powerful step toward achieving healthy skin. Remember, while drinking water is essential, it should complement a balanced diet and skincare regimen for the best results. So, raise your glass and toast to healthy, glowing skin!

Myths and Facts About Hydration You Need to Know
------------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, many people have questions. With so much information out there, it’s easy to get confused. Let’s clear up some common myths and facts to help you make informed choices about staying hydrated.

### Myth 1: You Only Need Water When You’re Thirsty

Many believe that thirst is the only sign to drink water. However, waiting until you're thirsty can lead to dehydration. By the time you feel thirsty, your body may already be lacking the necessary fluids. It's important to drink water regularly throughout the day, even if you’re not feeling thirsty.

### Fact: Hydration Affects Your Energy Levels

Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining your energy levels. When your body is well-hydrated, you're likely to feel more alert and less fatigued. Studies show that even mild dehydration can have a negative impact on mood and energy. A simple way to keep your energy levels up is to carry a water bottle and sip throughout the day.

### Myth 2: You Can Get Enough Water From Food Alone

While some foods do contain water, relying solely on them to meet your hydration needs is a myth. Fruits and vegetables, such as watermelon and cucumbers, can contribute to your daily fluid intake. However, they are not enough on their own to keep you adequately hydrated. Make sure to drink plenty of water in addition to consuming hydrating foods.

### Fact: Your Water Needs Vary

Not everyone's hydration needs are the same. Factors such as age, gender, activity level, and climate can affect how much water you need. On average, it’s recommended to drink about 8 cups (64 ounces) of water a day, but this can vary. Listening to your body and adjusting your water intake based on your individual needs is key.

### Myth 3: All Drinks Count Towards Your Daily Hydration

While beverages like tea, coffee, and juices do contribute to your fluid intake, not all drinks are created equal. Some beverages, especially those with high sugar or caffeine content, can have a diuretic effect, causing you to lose more fluids. Water remains the best choice for hydration, and it’s important to consume it regularly, regardless of other beverages you enjoy.

### Fact: Hydration Can Boost Your Skin Health

Drinking enough water can enhance your skin's appearance and health. When properly hydrated, your skin looks more vibrant and can better maintain its elasticity. Studies indicate that increased water intake can help reduce the visibility of fine lines and dryness, promoting overall skin wellness.

### Myth 4: You Need to Drink 8 Glasses of Water a Day

The ""8 glasses a day"" rule is a guideline, not a one-size-fits-all prescription. Some people may require more or less water. Instead of counting the number of glasses, focus on how you feel. If you're feeling refreshed, your hydration level is likely adequate. Pay attention to your body’s signals and adjust your intake accordingly.

### Fact: Dehydration Can Impact Your Mental Performance

### Hydration Tips

- Always keep a water bottle handy.
- Add flavor to your water with slices of lemon, berries, or cucumber.
- Set reminders to drink water if you often forget.
- Drink a glass of water before each meal.

Understanding the myths and facts about hydration can help you adopt better habits. By prioritizing your water intake, you support your overall health and enhance your well-being. Whether you enjoy a refreshing glass of water or add a slice of citrus, remember that staying hydrated is essential for everyone.

### Conclusion

Adequate hydration not only sustains your body’s functions but also plays a vital role in boosting your energy levels.

1hjehw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1hjehw6/how_do_i_forget_about_a_situation_like_this/,How do i forget about a situation like this?,"So. Normally after school, i was spending time at a club for youths (about 8-9). And i randomly started to talk with a girl. (We were both in 8 grade) And we bonded over talking about FNaF and generally talking about everything. (We were just friends) She didn't have access to almost any of the popular social media (stright parents) But she had bereal. So we communicated via this. 

Everywere i went in the club, she went after me. And even a girl said that we fit eachother well.

2 moths later, december. She became angry at me because of... ""Probably a rude joke i made"" (i didn't have any girl knowledge back then) And also one of my friends joined us. So we were a triple group. And they became very close. And because she was angry at me. She didn't really talk with me when we were 3. So i kinda became a third wheel. And then i went on Christmas holiday a few days later. (I also asked her on discord why she was angry at me. She answered ""It isn't in your interest"" So almost the entire holiday i was desperate and couldn't stop think about this situation. On bereal i was trying to make some Posts that would catch her attention. (Before she became angry, she always liked my posts. And then stopped) 

I was really scared, that this could be the end. It hurt, alot. But 3 minutes after new year 2024. She commented on my bereal ""I'm sorry, and I'm not angry at you anymore"" And i wrote ""new year, new you ig"" and it was fine again. The next day, the three of us were just chatting over discord. Everything was fine

And after the holiday, two of my classmates were at my house. We were just chilling. And they saw a drawing on my wall (which was a drawing that she made for me before the holiday). And they began to ask ""who is she"" with excitement. So the next day they went to the club, and met her (she was talking with our shared Friend way more than me) and yeah, nothing really happened this time (foreshadowing) 

(Me and that friend were and are best Bros (remember for later))

About January 15. Our shared Friend told me. That they became a pair. I was happy for them and stuff, but i was also sad. Because you know. Being the third wheel. (Aaand... I've had some feelings for her.)

I've heard him talk about it before, about their relationship. And he said that he liked her. Because she wouldn't jugde him for who he is (forget to mention that all these people in this story are mostly unpopular. Many called us ""NPC's"" i was called it as well.)

So after this situation, i was fr the third wheel. I was just sitting alone in the club, and just making ideas for some yt video's. BUT. Sometimes she would just walk to me, like if she saw i was uncomfortable with this. And talked with me for some minute's. We talked especially about music, because we had a similar music taste. She showed me Linkin Park, which is now one of my favorite bands ever.

February 2. The club had a LAN party. And the whole friend group was there. Including the 2 friends from school. And they began befriend her fr. 

Some things happened. She spend alot of time with. But. Us both had a vr with us. And she desperately asked if she could play on my vr. I was very annoyed im general. Because of sometimes when i wanted to start a conversation, she didn't wanna talk with me. So i said to her a few times. Why can't you play on his vr? And we we're like that about 5 minutes. At last, i just gave in and let her play.

Meanwhile she played Beat Saber. She asked me if ""I could hold her, so i could catch her if she would fall"" i didn't think much of that then, but now... (She is not that type of person, who would fall with vr glasses on)

And there was also a Pringle situation, someone gave her an unfinished tube of pringles, and i asked if i could get some for fun, she said no. And i pretended to be angry. But after 5 mimutes. She just came to me, and said that you could take the rest. I felt bad...

And then at last, when we were about to go to sleep, we were basically all besides eachother (also some other girls, which were the friends of hers, but she talked only with us) and we talked, and we slept. I couldn't sleep, and she couldn't either.  So me, her and the one from my class began to do some strange things. Because it was 5am, and we couldn't sleep. But i layed down. And after 2 minutes, she layed down aswell. But she layed very close to me. We were face to face, and even moved closer. We were looking at eachother. But the light's turned on, and we were asked to begin to get ready to get home.

Before we went home, i opened an ice coffee. And begin to drink it. And then she took the coffee from my hand, and drank it as well. (She mentioned to me that she didn't like coffee before)

The next 1 week we talked **alot** actually. But. The friend she was with, they didn't talk alot with eachother anymore. And he even told me ""bro, i feel like everything is breaking with her and me after the lan party"" 

In between the 3 week. She began to talk alot with one of  my classmates (the foreshadowing mentioned before) and they went along really well. They played together alot on discord and stuff. And in the club i wss with them also
The third wheel feeling came back, and it wasn't on that extent. And they even watched my yt video's together. It was heartwarming.

(One time when we were playing together, she said that she wishes we could be roommate's in the future.)

But. After the week. The whoel group had a joke on me, which was very VERY ANNOYING. And i hated that. She wasn't in the club that day, but they called her. And she also made the joke. Then... I broke, and shouted to her ""I HATE YOU"" And ""I DON'T WANNA KNOW YOU ANYMORE"" and unfortunately more. I walked away. And the group tried make things ok again. Didn't work

(I probably broke, because of all the frustration that accumulated because of the third feeling, and it was where i began to realize i maybe had some feelings for her)

And i also heard from them, that she cried because of this situation.

Already the next day, the group began to talk on discord. And i really wanted it apologize to her, because i felt guilty AF.

She wasn't open with me that much anymore.

Now she basically only talked that classmate of mine. First we just had fun with it, tried to make Valentine letters, because we thought that they maybe had feelings for eachother (the other relationship was fr done for)

But... At the end of the day. Me, the one that was in a relationship with her, and classmate 2 realized that she didn't wanna talk with us. We made a strike. We left the discord chat, and just weren't very friendly. 

(It was so brutal for me, that i even anonymously asked my dad about these types of situations)

The next day. She tried to apologize to me , because she fr felt guilt. She also send me a spotify link to the song ""vampire, Johnnie guilbert"" and she wrote also sorry to her ex (and nothing to the second classmate)

I didn't answer a day. But the friend that talked with her, convinced me to make it good again. And i did. I made a new group on discord. And it was almost fine (her ex and her were fine at first, but he broke entirely, and they able to talk to eachother without a person in between)

The 20 of February, the club went to a jumping center. It was the first time i saw her, since the ""boycott"" situation.

She instantly sat Besides me, and started to talk with me. But when we actually arrived at the jumping centre, she mostly alone. I asked her why didn't stick with me and her ex. And she said ""because i wanted to be alome"" 

She was Walking with another boy, which was also im our friend group, but not to that big of that extent.

There were ziplines in the centre, and me and her ex went to them. She went up to us. There were many people. She cut the line to be before us. But there was only one piece of gear left, so we needed to wait. She asked if she should wait until we get the gear. I kept Quiet, and he said ""We don't care"" then she went without a word, i feel very bad about it

But before we came into the centre, she asked me ""what do you think about my hat?"" She had a goofy hat on actually. So I told her for fun ""you look like a hobo"" she **SLAPPED** me, but had a laughter after

We also made some photos together, when we were about to go back to the club:)

When we came back, my classmate came by, and we played and talked. I had also talked with him before. He told me that he actually had a crush on her.

So we made a plan, that im gonna ask while he hides somewhere. And then i asked her ""do you have a crush on him"" and she told me ""definitely no"" i told him that, but we were skeptical if she told me the Truth.

He invited her to a friend group of his brother and his friends (discord) and they played alot. There was a big argument again between the other classmate, and her ex on a bereal group. I and the the first classmate tried to stop it. And it went... Yeah

The classmate that had a crush on her, had confessed his love. He got rejected in a respectful way. 

February 29. She left all of our discord groups. She only stayed on bereal, and eventually. She also leaves that.

I tried to apologize to her. I tried also ask her some questions. But she didn't wanna answer.

And i told her ""if you don't wanna talk to me, you could just block me, ane she did. And didn't unblock since""
 
The end.. well, not quite

Me and the second classmate were both on that server, and we tried to communicate with her. Didn't end that good

And she also for the most part didn't come to the club anymore.

But, me and her ex became friends wirh a girl, that was her old friend of hers. 

It was may. And we didn't talk alot about her. (Even though i couldn't stop thinking about her)

Then her friend casually mentions that ""she had a crush you since oktober, aka when we became friends"". I've began to laughing, in pain that is. (And it was confirmed)

All the thoughts came back, that basically meant that i was the fault for everything. And i also found out, that she cried many times because of me. I basically friend zoned her without realizing.

After that, i tried to add her on bereal again. She added me back. Actually, (she didn't add anyone back)

I made an indirect emotional post, so she can maybe notice it. But after a week, she unadded me again.

She was in the club, and i asked her why she added me, ahe said ""for fun""

Now it's june. And i was randomly looking at my yt channel. And then i see that she subscribed to me. I WAS IN DISBELIEF!!! (I fell out my chair when i was that)

6 days i was wondering why. And finally i broke myself, and made an alt account, and commented on one of her video's 

I wrote a long sentence, basically saying ""sorry for everything, i miss you""

She wrote ""I'm sorry for being a diva""

And i said it's fine. 

In august she randomly added me on roblox. I wrote to her. No answer, i deleted her again.

I added her in november, she accepted. And i wrote again to her in december. No answer yet

On side note, after she left. The friend group fell apart. 
I felt depressed since then. Really, i im more introverted than i was before.

I swear, i cannot forget about this situation. It still hurts.

Like I know this question might make people annoyed but I saw a reel talking about how the biggest Tim Hortons location (a coffee chain from Canada) actually happens to be in Pakistan. And maybe it’s because it’s Instagram, but people kept confusing Pakistan with the Indians in Canada and making racist remarks based off their previous disdain towards Indians. It’s one thing to be annoyed people don’t understand English and therefore get your order wrong but these people were mainly complaining about this in a nutshell  “Eh both are brown so same shit, and they should go back to their own country” 

Like these countries are melting pots, I never hear this sentiment with white immigrants who also don’t know English. Somebody in the comments even said “This can’t be Pakistan it’s all in English” which itself is dumb so maybe I shouldn’t be too concerned  with these people. But it’s just annoying how some people generalize when they themselves are also immigrant a lot of the time, just not brown ones. And the fact people getting mad at one group is starting to rub off onto other countries because they just both “Look brown so same thing” is crazy.

1hjeecv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hjeecv/can_you_go_to_miami_on_a_budget/,Can you go to Miami on a budget?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience about visiting Miami without breaking the bank. I know a lot of people think Miami is just luxury hotels and expensive clubs, but trust me, there's so much more to it!

I recently spent a week in Miami and discovered tons of budget-friendly ways to enjoy this vibrant city. First off, timing is everything. If you visit during the shoulder season (April-May or September-November), you'll find better deals on accommodations and fewer crowds.

One of the best things about Miami? Many of the most awesome attractions are totally free! The beautiful beaches don't cost a dime. South Beach is iconic, but check out Haulover Beach or Virginia Key Beach for a more laid-back vibe. The colorful Wynwood Walls art district is also free to explore, and it's perfect for those Instagram-worthy shots.

For affordable eats, Little Havana is your best friend. The Cuban sandwiches and cafecito (Cuban coffee) are not only cheap but absolutely delicious. Food trucks are everywhere in Miami, offering amazing local flavors at reasonable prices.

Now, here's something I discovered that really helped me save money while still experiencing the best of Miami. I found this awesome website: https://athometouch.com/miami that offers really affordable tours and activities. They have everything from food tours to boat trips, and the prices are way better than booking directly at tourist spots.

Using public transportation is another money-saver. The Metromover is free and connects many downtown attractions. For about $5, you can get a day pass for the Metrobus and Metrorail to explore further out.

Want to experience Miami nightlife without the crazy prices? Many bars in Wynwood and Downtown Miami have great happy hour deals. Some spots even offer free salsa lessons!

For accommodations, consider staying in neighborhoods like Little Havana or MiMo District instead of South Beach. You'll find better rates and get a more authentic experience.

If you're interested in seeing specific attractions, check out https://athometouch.com/miami before you go. They often have combo deals that can save you a bunch compared to buying tickets separately.

And don't forget about Miami's parks! The Oleta River State Park is perfect for kayaking, and the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden offers reduced admission after 4:30 PM.

So yes, you absolutely can do Miami on a budget! With some planning and smart choices, you can enjoy this amazing city without emptying your wallet. Just remember to book activities in advance and keep an eye out for deals. Miami's magic isn't just in its luxury spots - it's in the culture, the people, and the incredible experiences you can have at any budget level.

Hope this helps anyone planning a trip to Miami! Let me know if you have any questions!",1,1734801574.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

The lab is almost empty, with only the sound of the keyboard and the distant hum of the coffee machine breaking the silence. The clock on the wall reads 9:15 PM. At this hour, I’m usually in my office, surrounded by books and papers, immersed in preparing the lecture I have to give about free will. But tonight, I can’t concentrate. My mind is trapped in a whirlwind of thoughts that don’t seem to fit together.

I’m reviewing studies on the human brain, recent research on decision-making, and the surprising conclusions of neuroscientists. Something is lingering in my head, but I don’t know how to process it. I open another article. It’s a study discussing how the human brain makes decisions even before we, as individuals, become aware of them—exactly 550 milliseconds before we’re conscious of them. *It’s as if we’re puppets of the brain,* I think, going over the text’s words.

I recall the first time I read about Benjamin Libet’s experiments. In those studies, participants believed they were making decisions in real-time, but in reality, their brains had already activated the necessary areas to carry out those decisions seconds before they became aware of them. In other words, it seems our brain is taking control before we can even say, “I decided.” Does that mean we’re completely subject to a destiny we don’t control?

My mind drifts to another, more unsettling thought. If our brain is already making decisions without our consent, could that explain criminal behavior? Could a lack of control justify atrocious acts? Perhaps criminals, murderers, aren’t entirely responsible for what they do if their brain is the one making the decisions for them. But I can’t help questioning: is it really that simple?

I can’t stop reading, one page after another. The information on the brain areas involved in criminal behavior draws me in—a piece that fits into the puzzle in my mind. The amygdala, that small almond-shaped structure, is responsible for emotion, fear, anger, and also reward processing. The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, is associated with rational decision-making, impulse control, and morality. It’s as if the battle between emotion and reason plays out inside our brains.

But something holds me back. Something isn’t fitting. Something beyond the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. The thalamus. This ""gatekeeper"" that connects sensory information to the brain, integrating what we perceive from the external world. It’s the processing center of our reality. What if dysregulation in the thalamus is connected to criminal behavior?

It’s an idea that suddenly pops into my mind, like a flash of light in the darkness. If the thalamus isn’t properly managing sensory information, if it’s sending faulty signals to the brain, could that influence how we perceive the world? Could it cause a person to see reality in a distorted way, leading to violence, impulsivity, or a lack of empathy?",1,1734801460.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1hjeb5h,https://i.redd.it/cjzxitpzi88e1.jpeg,In-Depth Reviews of some Fragrances from My Collection – Ask Me Anything in the Comments!,"All the reviews here are based solely on my personal opinion and experience. I’ve given each fragrance in my collection ample time to macerate and worn them extensively to build a well-rounded perspective. I strongly recommend doing the same, let your fragrances macerate before forming an opinion, as they can change significantly over time. Some smooth out, others reveal hidden depths, and many even improve in performance.

I love every fragrance in my collection, which is why I can’t rank them or say one is better than another. If I don’t connect with a scent, I simply give it away. For example, Lattafa Vintage Radio and Armaf Club de Nuit Intense Woman will be leaving my collection soon as they feel too feminine for me.

These reviews focus on fragrances I feel deserve more attention, rather than the most hyped ones. The only exception is Club de Nuit Intense Man, my all-time favorite, which I felt deserved a special mention. I’ve tried to make these reviews as detailed as possible, but if it feels overwhelming, I encourage you to skip to the fragrances that interest you most.

If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to ask in the comments, I’ll be happy to answer! 


■ ■ ■ Orientica Royal Blue is a true hidden gem in the fragrance world, and it holds its own remarkably well when compared to the iconic Layton by Parfums de Marly.

The scent profile of Orientica Royal Blue is an opulent blend of spicy warmth and sweet sophistication. It opens with a vibrant burst of fresh apples and spices, followed by a decadent heart of florals and woods, wrapped in a base of creamy vanilla and rich amber. It mirrors Layton’s elegance and seductive charm and brings the same depth and complexity that feels equally refined.

While Layton is renowned for its longevity and projection, Orientica Royal Blue slightly outshines it with a beast-mode sillage and endurance that lasts all day and well into the night. It’s a fragrance that announces your presence and leaves a lingering trail of pure luxury.

I absolutely adore this scent it’s both versatile and incredibly enjoyable. It manages to feel regal yet approachable, making it perfect for any occasion. Honestly, it’s hard to imagine finding anything better at this price point or even in the niche market as a whole.

It’s the fragrance you didn’t know you needed but won’t want to live without.


■ ■ ■ Al Haramain Detour Noir Exclusif is a bold, unapologetic masterpiece that demands attention. The scent opens with a rich blend of spicy cardamom, creamy vanilla, with a faintly animalic and smoky note that sets the tone for a deeply mysterious journey. As it develops, a luxurious heart of floral, sandalwood, and patchouli takes center stage, exuding warmth and sophistication. The dry-down is pure indulgence, leathery, ambery, and subtly sweet, with a whisper of oud adding depth.

Fans of Parfums de Marly Layton Exclusif will notice the resemblance, particularly in the intense, opulent vibe both fragrances share. However, Detour Noir Exclusif leans slightly less animalic and more gourmand, offering a smoother, velvety finish compared to Layton Exclusif's raw power.

This fragrance is incredibly potent, one or two sprays will fill a room and could easily become overwhelming in small, enclosed spaces. Its sillage and longevity are unmatched, making it a scent best reserved for special occasions or cooler weather.

Not for the faint of heart or the uninitiated, Detour Noir Exclusif is a scent that challenges and rewards its wearer. While beginners might find its complexity intimidating, seasoned fragrance enthusiasts will be captivated by its intricacy and the story it tells. This is a statement fragrance, a work of art that showcases Al Haramain’s prowess in crafting unique olfactory experiences.


■ ■ ■ Club de Nuit Intense Man EDP 200ml is an absolute gem in the fragrance world, and anyone who appreciates bold, captivating scents needs to try this masterpiece. Let’s dive into why this fragrance deserves all the hype.

The scent opens with a vibrant burst of fruity notes. To me, the opening is undeniably fruity and far from the harshness that some reviews suggest. People are seriously overreacting when they call it ""harsh"" or ""chemical."" In this EDP version, the pineapple and citrus dominate in a refined, uplifting way, seamlessly transitioning into a smoky, woody heart that radiates elegance. The dry-down is where it truly shines: a perfect blend of ambergris, musk, and patchouli that lingers with an addictive warmth.

Yes, we must address the elephant in the room Creed Aventus. While Aventus has earned its reputation, its performance often leaves much to be desired. Club de Nuit Intense Man, on the other hand, is a beastly performer. It lasts for hours on end, projecting powerfully in the first few hours and leaving an intoxicating trail that lingers all day. Aventus may have a slight edge in refinement, but it simply cannot compete in terms of value and strength.

This fragrance is a powerhouse in every sense. It’s so strong that it can make you noseblind within a short time of wearing it. But don’t be fooled just because you can’t smell it doesn’t mean it isn’t projecting. People around you will definitely notice it, and you’ll be getting compliments long after you’ve stopped noticing the scent yourself. Few fragrances can command a room like this one.

At around €50 for 200ml, this fragrance is an absolute steal. Comparing it to Creed Aventus, which costs several times more, the value is staggering. Nothing, absolutely nothing, comes close to beating Club de Nuit Intense Man at this price point. It gives you an Aventus-like experience without breaking the bank, and it does so with unmatched longevity and projection.

Club de Nuit Intense Man EDP is the ultimate fragrance for someone who wants a bold, sophisticated scent that lasts all day. The fruity opening is far better than critics suggest, the performance is monstrous, and the price is unbeatable. Whether you’re new to fragrances or a seasoned collector, this is a must-have in your collection. For the price and quality, it’s truly unmatched. Nothing else comes close.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Tres Nuit is an aromatic green masterpiece that exudes freshness and elegance with every spray. Its scent profile is a delightful blend of candied fresh-cut grass and a luxurious, soapy clean essence. Imagine walking through a lush meadow on a breezy spring day, with a soft sweetness lingering in the air, that's Tres Nuit.

It’s no secret that Tres Nuit draws heavy comparisons to Creed’s Green Irish Tweed, and for good reason. The resemblance is uncanny. Both share a similar green, citrusy freshness underscored by a smooth, clean vibe. However, where Green Irish Tweed struggles to maintain its presence, Tres Nuit edges it out slightly in performance, though admittedly, its longevity and projection are still on the weaker side. This is a shame because the scent is truly captivating.

Despite its moderate performance, Tres Nuit is perfect as a gym fragrance. Its light, clean aura is refreshing and energizing, and it won't overpower or offend those around you. At a fraction of Creed’s exorbitant price tag, Tres Nuit delivers incredible value. Paying Creed-level prices for such fleeting performance feels like a joke when Tres Nuit delivers a nearly identical scent experience for a fraction of the cost.

Every time I spray Tres Nuit, I find myself more delighted by its charm. It’s a fragrance that grows on you, captivating you with its simplicity and elegance. If only it lasted longer, it might be in heavy rotation for other occasions, but as a gym fragrance, it’s absolutely perfect.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Art du Parfum is a hidden gem in the world of barbershop fougères. From the moment you spray it, you're greeted with a symphony of rich, aromatic notes that embody elegance and masculinity. This fragrance exudes a virile confidence, blending spicy, woody, and slightly herbal accords into a smooth, refined scent profile that feels both classic and modern.

In many ways, Art du Parfum feels like a more wearable cousin to Dior Sauvage Elixir. Where Sauvage Elixir is bold and unrelenting, Art du Parfum tempers its strength with finesse. It’s less harsh, making it easier to reach for in a variety of situations, whether you're dressed up for a formal occasion or keeping it casual. This versatility makes it a standout in its price range.

One of its strongest attributes is its very good performance. The longevity is impressive, easily lasting through an entire day, while its sillage strikes a perfect balance, noticeable without being overwhelming. It's a fragrance that makes its presence known and leaves a lasting impression.

However, it's not a fragrance for everyone. Its barbershop fougère DNA carries a mature, sophisticated vibe that may require a more seasoned or trained nose to fully appreciate. But for those willing to give it time, its layers of complexity reward with a rich, addictive elegance.

Compared to Lattafa Asad, Art du Parfum is in a league of its own. While Asad leans heavily on sweetness and can feel overly dense or synthetic, Art du Parfum strikes a perfect balance between airy and grounded. It feels cleaner, more refined, and far less cloying, qualities that elevate it far above Asad’s more affordable appeal.

Ultimately, Art du Parfum is a versatile, elegant, and virile fragrance that commands attention without overwhelming. For me, it’s an easy favorite. Its polished take on the barbershop fougère makes it a wearable, modern classic that’s less abrasive and more nuanced than many of its competitors. Highly recommended for anyone looking for sophistication in a bottle.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Art Du Parfum Abstracto is a gourmand fragrance that strikes a fascinating balance between decadence and subtlety. The scent begins with a tangy burst of citrus that immediately grabs your attention, adding a touch of sourness that contrasts beautifully with its sweeter elements. As it develops, a rich, bittersweet coffee note emerges, adding depth and sophistication. The sweetness, however, isn’t cloying, it’s softened by a creamy, vanillic base that feels like the heart of the fragrance. This vanilla aspect is warm, comforting, and slightly powdery, tying all the elements together like the frosting on a perfectly baked pastry.

What’s remarkable about Abstracto is its ability to last for hours while remaining gentle. It isn’t loud or overpowering; instead, it stays close to the skin, offering a protective yet understated aura. The scent profile likely contributes to this, making it ideal for situations where you want to smell enticing without being intrusive.

Compared to Valentino Born in Roma Intense, Abstracto feels more gourmand and intimate. While Born in Roma Intense leans heavily on boldness and projection, Abstracto whispers its charm, a buttery, dessert-like scent that feels more personal and comforting.

While I admire its artistry, I wouldn’t wear it often as I find the pastry-like quality a bit too prominent for my taste. That said, I love the vanillic sweetness; it’s inviting, warm, and rewarding, especially when I’m relaxing. On slower days or quiet evenings, Abstracto feels like a cozy indulgence, a scent that makes you want to curl up with a book or sip a creamy latte.

If the idea of walking around smelling like an elegant, freshly baked vanilla pastry appeals to you, Abstracto is a fantastic choice. It’s a quiet masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression without ever raising its voice.


■ ■ ■ Al Haramain Detour Eco is a strikingly refined fragrance that balances modern elegance with a hint of old-world luxury. From the very first spray, it greets you with a radiant burst of fresh green notes, blended seamlessly with a sweet, woody undertone. As it unfolds, warm saffron, velvety cedarwood, and a subtle hint of leather create a harmonious, enveloping heart. The dry-down reveals a rich base of oud, amber, and musk, leaving an impression of opulence and sophistication.

When compared to Parfums de Marly Haltane, Detour Eco delivers a similar luxurious green-woody experience but feels slightly less smooth, with a more accessible sweetness that softens its sharp edges. For those familiar with Initio Oud for Greatness, Detour Eco captures a similar DNA but elevates it with a more balanced and cohesive profile, making it the superior choice for many.

This fragrance is incredibly powerful, projecting effortlessly and lingering on the skin for hours. In small, enclosed spaces, it can become overwhelming, so a light hand is essential. The sillage is immense, leaving a trail that turns heads and sparks compliments.

Detour Eco is not for the faint-hearted or newcomers to niche perfumery. Its bold complexity demands an experienced nose to fully appreciate its nuances. However, for seasoned fragrance enthusiasts, it is an absolute delight, layered, intricate, and deeply satisfying. Al Haramain has once again crafted a scent that feels like a work of art, offering a level of luxury and craftsmanship that rivals much more expensive options.


■ ■ ■ Rasasi Fattan is a masterpiece of Middle Eastern perfumery that leans toward modern sophistication while still retaining a natural, grounded character. From the moment it touches the skin, you’re greeted with a fresh, green citrus explosion, sharp, vibrant, and invigorating. Grapefruit dominates the opening, bolstered by a zesty bergamot, evoking the scent of dew-laden grass kissed by the morning sun.

As the fragrance evolves, its grassy, earthy heart takes center stage. Vetiver here is the star, crisp, rooty, and slightly smoky. This grassy quality is what truly captivates me. It’s as though you’re walking barefoot through a wild meadow after a summer rain, the smell of damp earth and cut grass lingering in the air. The composition is tied together with subtle florals and a touch of peppery spice, giving it an understated elegance.

Comparing Rasasi Fattan to Terre d’Hermès, the inspiration is undeniable, but Fattan stands tall on its own. While Terre d’Hermès has a mineral, almost abstract quality, Rasasi Fattan feels more grounded and natural. Fattan leans heavily into the grassy, earthy facets that I adore, while Terre d’Hermès balances those elements with its signature orange zest and flinty accord. If Terre is the polished suit-and-tie professional, Fattan is the free-spirited adventurer who knows how to clean up nicely.

The performance of Rasasi Fattan is another strong point. It projects confidently without being overpowering and lingers for hours, leaving a soft, green trail that feels effortless and refined.

In short, I love Rasasi Fattan. Its grassy aspect is what sets it apart for me, creating a serene, grounded vibe that’s perfect for any occasion. It’s an affordable gem that punches well above its price point, offering a sophisticated scent that rivals its more expensive counterparts. If you’re a fan of vetiver, grassy accords, or the outdoors bottled into a fragrance, Rasasi Fattan is a must-try.


■ ■ ■ Al Haramain Detour Noir Intense is a bold, intoxicating fragrance that exudes power and refinement. From the outset, it unveils a creamy almond note, blended with touches of lavender and vanilla, creating a warm, almost edible opening. As the scent develops, it transitions into a heart of spicy cinnamon, sandalwood, and a hint of floral sophistication, adding depth and complexity. The dry-down is luxurious, with rich amber, musk, and a faint metallic edge that feels strikingly modern yet timelessly elegant.

In comparison to Parfums de Marly Pegasus Exclusif, Detour Noir Intense shares a similarly almond-driven profile, but it feels richer and slightly sweeter, leaning more toward the gourmand side. It tempers Pegasus Exclusif’s metallic sharpness, offering a smoother, creamier take on the DNA. For enthusiasts of almond-based fragrances, this is a more indulgent and approachable alternative.

This fragrance is incredibly potent, with a sillage and longevity that are second to none. Just a couple of sprays are enough to command attention, but in small or enclosed spaces, it can easily become overwhelming. Perfect for cooler weather or evening wear. Its power and projection make it a statement scent for those who want to leave a lasting impression.

Detour Noir Intense is not for beginners; its boldness and complexity require an experienced palate to appreciate its many layers. However, for seasoned fragrance enthusiasts, it’s a treasure, refined, intricate, and deeply memorable. Whether you’re drawn to its almond-centric warmth or its luxurious, modern feel, this fragrance is a testament to Al Haramain’s ability to craft scents that rival far pricier competitors. It’s perfect for those who appreciate opulence in every spritz.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Legesi is an exquisite gem in the fragrance world that exudes sophistication and charm. From the first spritz, it reveals a crisp, aromatic freshness that feels impeccably clean and refined. The scent opens with a sparkling blend of citrus and herbal notes, gradually unfolding into a heart of aromatic lavender and geranium, grounded by a base of woods and musk. It instantly brings to mind the creamy, rich scent of luxurious shaving foam, a hallmark of timeless masculinity.

Compared to Chanel Platinum Égoïste, Armaf Legesi carries a similar DNA but offers a slightly fresher, more modern twist. Where Égoïste leans towards an upscale, classic profile, Legesi feels brighter, more vibrant, and versatile. It’s a scent that transitions seamlessly from a sharp business suit in the boardroom to a casual evening out, making it a true all-rounder in any fragrance collection.

I absolutely love this fragrance. It strikes a perfect balance between approachable and elegant, embodying the essence of understated luxury. Armaf Legesi is a must-have for anyone who loves classic yet versatile scents with a contemporary edge.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Beau Acute is a fantastic masculine fougère scent that delivers an impressive blend of timeless sophistication and modern appeal. From the first spray, it captivates with its sharp, aromatic freshness. The opening is lively and green, with crisp citrus and herbaceous notes leading the charge. As it develops, a beautifully balanced heart of lavender, geranium, and spicy nuances emerges, evoking a sense of clean confidence. The dry-down is warm and woody, with a subtly sweet base of amber and musk that lingers powerfully.

Many compare Beau Acute to Abercrombie & Fitch Fierce and Mont Blanc Legend, but in my opinion, it’s an upgraded version and surpasses both. While Fierce leans heavily on youthful energy and Legend offers a slightly softer profile, Beau Acute is bolder, more refined, and undeniably stronger. Its projection and longevity are remarkable, easily outlasting both competitors on my skin and considerably more on my clothes.

Contrary to what some believe, Beau Acute is not a clone of Chanel Platinum Égoïste. While it shares a similar fougère DNA, it carves its own identity with a distinctive richness and intensity.

Though it may be an older scent that many are familiar with, Armaf has crafted it so impeccably that it still feels vibrant and appealing. The versatility of Beau Acute is another standout quality, it’s equally suited for daytime wear, office settings, or a night out. I find myself reaching for it often, and every time, it feels like the perfect choice.

Overall, Armaf Beau Acute is an outstanding fragrance that combines strength, elegance, and adaptability. It’s a must-try for anyone who appreciates Fierce DNA and a classic fougère done exceptionally well.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Club de Nuit Oud is a masterful creation that defies the boundaries of simple categorization. While it draws comparisons to Xerjoff's Erba Pura with its initial fruity brightness, this fragrance quickly establishes its own identity, marked by a deeply woodsy, opulent character that feels undeniably high-end.

The scent opens with a vibrant medley of ripe fruits, lending a sparkling sweetness that grabs attention. But where Erba Pura leans heavily into its fruity gourmand profile, Club de Nuit Oud takes a darker, more sophisticated turn. The heart reveals an exquisite Cambodian oud, sweet, warm, and rich, yet free from the pungent animalic or synthetic qualities often associated with oud. This is a smooth, honeyed oud, embracing you with an earthy depth that feels polished and luxurious.

The woody base is a true highlight. It is complex, with layers of dry cedar, creamy sandalwood, and a whisper of smoky resin. These notes blend seamlessly with the oud, grounding the sweetness of the fruits and transforming the composition into something far more nuanced and mature.

This fragrance doesn’t merely mimic Erba Pura; it stands apart with its craftsmanship. The balance between the sweet and woody elements is impeccable, creating a perfume that feels both approachable and undeniably expensive. Armaf Club de Nuit Oud isn’t just a dupe, it’s a statement piece, a bold and refined scent for those who appreciate the interplay of fruits and woods without losing the soul of true artistry.


■ ■ ■ Armaf Club de Nuit Man is an underrated gem that deserves far more recognition in the fragrance world. While many know the brand for its “Intense” versions, this regular EDT offers a alternative that blends sophistication with approachability.

The scent opens with a burst of citrus and light florals, transitioning smoothly into a warm, woody base with subtle spicy undertones. Unlike its more famous counterpart, One Million by Paco Rabanne, Club de Nuit Man feels refined and less ostentatious. It sidesteps the overly sweet, bubble-gummy vibe that defines One Million, opting instead for a drier, more mature profile. This is a fragrance for the man who wants to be noticed without shouting.

What truly sets it apart is its balance. It avoids the harshness and overwhelming nature that some popular designer scents fall into, instead offering a smoother, more versatile experience. Despite being an EDT, the performance is impressive, with solid projection and longevity that hold their own against more concentrated formulations.

Armaf Club de Nuit Man is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a sophisticated, grown-up alternative to mainstream hits like One Million. It’s elegant, approachable, and delivers remarkable value. If you’re looking for a hidden gem, this is one fragrance that definitely deserves more hype.

1hje63y,https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/1hje63y/i_was_wrong_about_the_remarkable_pro/,I was wrong about the Remarkable Pro,"This is going to be a lengthy post (maybe?) so apologies in advance, but maybe it will help others who are in my shoes. 

I bought the Remarkable Pro because I was seeking better organization of thought, less distractions, and because I like tech stuff. I get terribly distracted during meetings by technology, and wanted something I could take notes on. Enter the Remarkable Pro. 

With Remarkable offering a 100 day trial it was a no brainer to plunge in. I tried to avoid outside opinions, but read this sub a bit, which honestly tainted my opinion a bit early on (I purchased my RPP on 10/28). Seeing screen issues, letdowns due to restrictive software, ghosting, etc, really made me think this was a mistake, but I decided to continue using it. Fast forward to 12/3 when I initiated a refund. I thought I had made up my mind by this point in time as the thing I wanted it to do wasn't happening: I couldn't place a cursor where I wanted to type bits of text I could search for later to refresh my memory on notes. I still can't do that today, but I'm keeping my RPP anyway. 

Here's why I was wrong. I thought I needed to search for old notes, or hyperlink pages, or have a split screen (sorry split screen guy, I hope you get what you want), but what I really needed was the act of mindfulness. I have a handful of notebooks on my RPP, including one for my wife, and they've been so helpful to me. I track my coffee brews on one (shoutout /r/pourover), I take work notes on another. I have a notebook to write down things I want to improve at home. I made a notebook for planning how I want to spend/save over the next year. I'm sure I'll add more things to it as ideas pop up, and what has been important is that this device has helped me dedicate the time and space I need for ideas to pop up. 

Is the device perfect? No. Honestly, there are things that it leaves that are to be desired. I would still like to have some flexibility with typed text. The ghosting is a bit annoying, although infrequent. There's so lag here and there, but nothing bad by any means. Is it overpriced for what it is? Maybe if you compare it to an iPad, but it isn't meant to be an iPad, and it isn't made by a company with unlimited resources. 

So if for some reason you’ve read all of this (why would you subject yourself to that), and you’re still not sure if the RPP is for you, I’ll leave you with some parting thoughts. If you’re on the fence just buy it and see what happens. You have 100 days to figure it out. I would also encourage you not to make a decision in the first 30 days. Spend some time with it and get to know what it can and can’t do, and what it does for you specifically.

1hje42v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hje42v/poland_is_alive_and_we_cannot_leave_pt2/,Poland is Alive and We Cannot Leave pt2,"[part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/s/QornbAi8w9)

I sat in bed listening to the rush of the town below my apartment building: People yelling, cars honking, babies crying... Hard to believe it was 3 in the morning with how active the streets were. Those who weren't out, were glued to their televisions watching the lastest emergency update. 

For Poland had changed course, and our location was on the ""estimated locations list"". We'd all seen what happens, when Poland climbs it's putrid, amoeba-like country over an area. We'd seen the towns, cities, *countries* completely leveled, from being underneath it. No homes, no grass, no trees. The only time Poland actually didn't change much landscape were those weeks it was stuck in the Sahara desert. 

Now it was coming here. New regulations had the UN, NATO, FEMA, and whatever else, taking the responsibility of helping get all humans out of Polands path. Usually folks had a few days to evacuate. Some only had hours. Some people chose to stay. 

I, myself, truly have stopped caring. *I knew* about this phenomenon at the beginning of April and no one believed me. My research lined up perfectly with that of the seismologists. But I found something else. 

I found...  

A heartbeat...

...and was immediately mocked.

And I get it! It's completely ridiculous for a large piece of earth to suddenly have an even, rhythmic pulse. But that was my job, at the environmental protection agency -to find life in unlikely places- and I was good at it! That's why I was known all around the world.  That's why as soon as things started getting weird in Poland, I showed up to examine things, myself. Except once I made that discovery, they threw me aside. Clearly I had gone bonkers. All because I had some crazy hypothesis and acted on it. 

When I first heard Polands's heart, mine nearly stopped. I called my connections with the UN Security Council, a gave my findings and concerns. I could tell they thought I was nuts, but they humoured me anyway. In the end, they asked what I wanted from them. Of course, I said I needed funding, and a crew to pursue this, and that's when they couldn't hide their laughter anymore. They said I was ridiculous for requesting so much for such an impossible theory. After that, not only did they turn me down, but they dropped all other funding also. 

And so now I lay here. Listening to chaos flow over our little city of Decatur, Illinois. The light of the tv flooding my room, showing the disasters of Poland in real time. 

My phone lights up, and I look to see my old buddy Jeremy calling. Fuck that guy. I let it go to voicemail. He calls two more times before I finally answer. 

""Hello.""

""Dammit, Jordan! Why won't you respond to us?!?""

""Gosh, I mean, I've been so busy. Studying mushrooms, and dragonflies. There's this new show out that covers both of those things along with unicorns and fairies. I mean, I can't afford to actually go out and study *real* ecosystems, since y'all cut my funding-

""Enough!"" Jeremy took a deep breath, trying to calm down, ""Look. We need you. We are willing to admit you were right, and we were wrong. We'll do whatever you want, just please say you'll meet with us, to discuss Poland.""

I thought about it for a few seconds. Maybe I could stand to survive for just a little bit longer. Except... ""I'm in Decatur. I'm right on Poland's path. Unless you can get me out of here, I can't help you.""

""Please, we've had your location for weeks. A chopper is on its way now. Get to your apartment's roof top."" 

Soon I was being flown toward a convention center, states away. Out of Polands's path. For now. 

Landing on the center's rooftop I could see Jeremy, and a few other gentlemen, waiting for me. We didn't shake hands, as I made it to them. They just turned and gestured for me to follow. They all looked exhausted. I forgot it was now probably 4 or 5 in the morning. but who knows how long these men have been up, trying to figure out ways to get Poland under control. 

We made it to a large conference room filled with technology. TV and computer screens lined the walls. Radios and other communication systems covered the desks. There were 6 other people in the room, monitoring specific screens. This must have been the new home base for the security council. 

""Take a seat"" Jeremy said, ""coffee?""

""Oh, yes please"" I responded, casually. 

Another man came and sat by me, and opened a laptop. ""Hello Jordan, my name is Rodney. I'm glad you made it hear safely, but we don't have much time to rest. Here, I have put together a list of everything we need to go over""

Jeremy brought me my coffee as Rodney continued, ""We're going to start at the beginning. When the earthquakes began. That was into the first week of April. A few different crews went out to do research-""

""Like me. Like when I found the heart beat and y'all dismissed me""

""Oh for the love of....just... just shut up, Jordan!"" Jeremy mumbled behind me, while pinching the bridge of his nose. 

Rodney continued, ""By mid-April, we had confirmed that all the quakes took place on the entire border of Poland, and by that time, the edges of the country were separating from the surrounding countries. 

""Also during that time is when Poland started rising in size, and changing it's shape, it caused huge quakes in Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany.

""During the first half of April, we did encourage those living in Poland to evacuate, and while we got a few hundred people out, safely, many didn't believe it was a threat, until it was too late. 

""As soon as Poland had finished rising in elevation and changing shape, it began to move, which was at the beginning of May.

""As we've seen through satellite images, anything Poland moves over is consumed. Lakes dry up, and whole cities disappear. 

""Planes and helicopters, more so, are nearly impossible to fly over Poland while it's moving. Our computers go haywire, causing crashes half the time. We have had a tiny bit of luck, landing aircrafts on the country while it's stopped. But it's nearly impossible to know when Poland will start moving again. Sometimes Poland is stopped for days, weeks, or just hours.""

I held up my hand, ""Has it been tried.... or... So, how about this scenario: we fly a plane onto Poland while it's stopped, with no intention of moving it, until the *next* time it's stopped. Giving people more time to all get to the plane, and more time to fly out of Poland."" 

""It's been tried."" Jeremy looked down and sighed. 

""Well, the news hasn't covered that.""

""Because it failed. It seems Poland can sense large gatherings of humans. We've had completely filled planes, sink down into Poland, right before take-off."" 

Rodney added, ""There have been some rogue pilots who've flown in and out of the country, and  were lucky enough not to be consumed, and also were able to get some people evacuated. But because of the risks, we no longer send large planes over. 

""We can't even get ""plane alerts"" out to the citizens, since they lost power. We've had planes land and stay down for days, with no one showing up.""

We all sat there quietly for a moment. Then Rodney pulled up the next talking point, ""Since Poland started moving, we've seen damage to Ukraine, Russia, down through Pakistan, and into India. The ocean has no affect on it, because next it crossed through Australia, down to New Zealand. 

""That's kind of when we learned that Poland had no strategy to where it went. It did a 180° and headed to Africa, starting down at South Africa, and making it's way north, until it hit the Sahara, and..."" Rodney squinted at his notes, ""that was the end of June. We were both relieved and concerned, because in the desert, Poland got very slow. We thought it may...die? Which would stop all the chaos""

""And the concern?""

""Well, obviously, because it's getting closer to America.""

""I will say, it was a pretty good try, with the nukes while Poland was in the Atlantic.""

Rodney read his notes, ""Yeah, that's next here: While in the Atlantic, it was decided not to nuke Poland, itself, but the water around it, hoping to change the countries course."" 

""Like I said... good try."" I sipped my coffee. 

""So that takes us to now. Poland it making it's way straight through the US."" Rodney closed his laptop. He folded his hands and looked at me. 

I sat there, waiting for more information. ""So..what do you want from me?"" 

Jeremy and Rodney looked at each other and back at me, ""Well. Obviously we we want to stop it. And we're running out of ideas."" 

Rodney added, ""Of course, we don't want to bomb it. Well, we do, but we don't want to hurt the remaining people on the country.""

""Frankly, if there's anyone left on Poland, I think they'd be fine with that."" I chuckled. 

Jeremy sat in the chair on the other side of me. He looked like he was struggling to get words out, ""So... You found a heartbeat.""

""Yes.""

""Which... Of course means it's alive.""

""That's pretty obvious.""

""I'm curious, if you think..."" Jeremy took a deep breath, ""if you think... There's some way to communicate with it.""

I stared at Jeremy, almost not believing what I just heard. I could barely take a breath, before I bursted into laughter. 

The men stayed silent while I laughed. They knew how their question sounded. 

I finally took a breath, ""You guys thought my theory on a heartbeat was crazy, and then you ask me this?? What kind of sense does that even make?! You want to communicate with a piece of land?!"" I was almost angry now.

Jeremy: ""Well what the fuck else are we supposed to do?!"" 

Me: ""It's a fucking country! A bordered piece of land!""

Jeremy: ""You think I don't know that??""

Me: ""It doesn't make sense!""

Jeremy: ""None of this makes sense! We are out of options though!""

Me: ""I actually had proof! Proof of a heartbeat, and *probably* COULD have figured out more about why this fucking country now has an organic anatomy, but YALL shut down my FUNDING!""

Jeremy, ""Oh gosh... Because you sounded CRAZY!""

Rodney broke between us, ""Guys please!"" He walked over to two maps. One of Poland before it changed, and one from after. ""Jordan, do you think you could remember where you were, when you discovered the heartbeat?"" 

I rolled my eyes and walked over to him. ""What are you thinking?"" 

Rodney sighed, ""We have an idea. I don't know if it's the best idea, but like Jeremy said, we're out of options."" 

I looked over at Jeremy, and then back to Rodney. 

""We saw that it struggled in the desert. That means it can feel stress, maybe even pain. And that maybe it can even be killed. If we can pinpoint the heart, perhaps, we can drop just *one* bomb, right over it.""

Now I was pinching my nose bridge, ""You guys know how heartbeats work, right?;"" 

Jeremy and Rodney stared at me. 

""Dropping a bomb over Poland where you hear the heartbeat, would be similar to, if I put a stethoscope to my foot and claimed my heart was there, because I could hear my pulse there.""

Jeremy threw his arms up, ""Why the FUCK did I bring you in?!"" 

""I don't know, Jeremy! You could have *left* me in Poland where I could have actually triangulated the heartbeat! We could have had a lead! Now we have nothing! We have no...."" 

I stared at one screen on the far wall. It was putting X's over every spot on Poland where sinkholes appeared. I walked over to the screen. Were the sink holes random? Or did they have a pattern? 

I looked over at the guys, ""We're going to need more coffee."" 

A tiny smile appeared on Jeremy's face. But it quickly went away as the room started to shake.

Rodney looked to one of the screen watchers, ""Judith, where's Poland's location??"" 

A woman named Judith pulled up satellite images. ""Ugh.... Alaska. Wait. Russia. Oh gosh, it's moving so fast!"" 

""Why's it going so fast??"" Rodney exclaimed.

I quickly sat down at a computer and started calculating. 

""What are you doing?"" Jeremy asked.

""With Poland going so fast, we may have even less time. There's no way we can nuke it, at that speed. But we can be ready, for when it stops again. If it stops again."" 

""And if it doesn't?"" 

I didn't respond. There was no time. I had to hope there was some method to where the sinkholes appeared. ""Judith, please keep an eye of where Poland is"". 

Hours went by. Maybe even days. The vibrations didn't stop. Poland hadn't slowed down. It sped over Russia, to areas north of Canada. It was doing laps around Earth. I couldn't believe we were still alive. 

I was quiet. Measuring distance from sinkhole to sinkhole. Noting the places that weren't affected. And calculating the possibilities of where they could arise. 

""There"" I said. Rodney and Jeremy came to my side, ""There's your Fucking heart!"" Jeremy nearly collapsed on the table. Rodney grabbed my shoulders in a congratulatory fashion. 

""Ok so where's the closest base? Who's still available? What's the next step?"" 

""Guys."" 

We all looked over at Judith. 

""It's. It's coming."" 

My heart sank. Would this all have been for nothing? 

All of us in the room looked at each other and appeared to have the same thing on our mind. There was no stopping Poland. And there wasn't enough time to evacuate.

I ran out of the room.

""Where are you going Jordan??"" Jeremy followed me out. Soon everyone was following, as I climbed the stairs to the roof top. 

Up on the roof, panting, I scanned the area, spinning until I saw the direction where I knew Poland would be coming from. 

There it was. Who knows how far it was, but I could see it's disastrous wreckage. The smoke and dust filling the skyline. 

Everyone stood around me. Some people holding each other, others silently staring. There was nothing to do but watch, until we were also absorbed by Poland.

There wasn't even time to recall my fondest memories. My childhood. My family. 

There was only Poland. 

""It's getting closer!"" Another woman sobbed into Judith's arms. 

But then something happened. As the building shook harder... as Poland got closer....

It lifted off the ground. 

What were we witnessing?? 

I fell to my knees, as I saw the large country literally take flight.

""My God..."" Rodney gasped. 

We watched. 

We watched it get higher. 

And higher. 

Until it was above the sky. 

Above the atmosphere. 

Poland was in space. 

After MONTHS of causing chaos all over the planet...

Poland was gone. 


2 months later...

Poland is moving. 

Actually Poland hadn't stopped moving. Ever since it jumped off of Earth, it has been chugging along in space, passing other planets. People who survived Poland, have all come together to build small, close communities. Slowly, life will become normal again. 

""Jordan, are you still here?"" I heard a voice call from down the hall. Of course I knew who it was, and didn't respond. Jeremy popped his head into the conference room. He scanned over the dark room, until he saw me, lit up by a computer screen, in the back corner.  

Quietly he came and sat be me. He cleared his throat, ""Jordan. I'm concerned.""

I didn't look away from the screen. 

""You've been up here, by yourself for weeks now. Poland's been declared 'not a threat' to the planet for a whole month. Please, get up. Come stay with me. Come see how we've rebuilt some cities."" 

I sighed and looked over at him, ""Not yet.""

Jeremy, eyes were sad, ""...I'll be back tomorrow. Please try and get some decent sleep."" As he stood up, he dropped a bag of food on the desk. 

He was a good friend. But I had to stay here. I had to make sure Poland didn't return. I stared at different windows on my screen. One showing earth, one showing emergency updates from all around the world, and one that sent updated images on where Poland was in space. 

I had to keep watching. 

I had to make sure. 

Poland wasn't dead. It was just gone. 

But if it came back, I knew how to kill it. 

So for now, I'll just keep watch.

WCs are a kind of business that is collectively owned by its worker-members who each have a vote. In smaller firms, the hierarchy may be flat and direct democracy is applied. In larger firms, representative democracy may be used to streamline decision-making processes. Many WCs employ a mixture of direct and representative democratic structures. There are many ways to structure a WC, so it is important to remain attentive and consider nuance when discussing and passing overarching judgment on the model. This point will be elaborated further later on.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/HpnmfXkcDf) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/AGItFrPL1f) discusses how worker cooperatives would lead to high unemployment and that it would almost never make sense for these firms to hire additional workers. The marginal product of labor and the law of diminishing marginal productivity are mentioned as the economic basis for this claim. The idea is that when a firm hires workers, the marginal productivity increase will decrease per additional worker, *ceteris paribus*. At some point, the marginal productivity of an additional worker may reach a negative value and decrease overall productivity of the firm.

The table below displays a simplified example of a coffee shop that has access to three coffee makers.

|\# of Workers|Output|Marginal Product|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1|5|5|
|2|10|5|
|3|15|5|
|4|17|2|
|5|18|1|
|6|17|\-1|

There may be a negative value in the marginal product due to overcrowding or an inefficient use of resources, rendering the idea of hiring more workers undesirable after such a point is reached.

>The marginal product of labor is usually a positive number during early hiring of workers, but does not usually show constant returns—the MPL will always begin to slow as the number of laborers increases, and they, therefore, must begin sharing resources like equipment during the production process. Eventually, the MPL becomes negative, when hiring an additional worker would disrupt the company and cause a decrease in production. This is called the law of diminishing marginal returns.[^(\[1\])](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-about-marginal-product-of-labor-in-economics)

To be very clear, this economic concept applies to both cooperative and non-cooperative firms. A CF is constrained by the law of diminishing marginal returns just as a WC is.

It is incredibly important to note that the marginal product of labor may be measured only when the variable input is labor, and nothing else. If one were to add an additional worker as well as an additional coffee maker, then the measuring of the marginal product will not be accurate. This is what *ceteris paribus* means: all else being equal. This point is paramount in understanding because we know that non-labor factors can be variable, which would in effect change the level of the marginal product.

A WC, just like a CF, is capable of reinvesting into itself. In France, WCs reinvest significantly more of its surpluses than is legally required,^[[2]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPEO-10-2022-0025/full/html) and similar is found for firms in Italy.^[[3]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0885-3339(2011)0000012012/full/html). Very often, WCs explicitly set aside a portion of its profits in a reserve for reinvestment. These plans frequently include expanding the business by opening new locations or entering new markets, as well as improvements to capital such as purchasing additional machines or improving technologies. When a firm's increases its physical capital (tangible assets useful in production), its marginal product *increases* and the curve on the marginal product of labor graph shifts upwards.[^(\[4\])](https://www.hsto.info/iis-ru/bm600/dl/04_cost1_shortrun_b4.pdf) This means that the firm is now able to hire an amount of additional workers without resulting in a negative marginal product.

*Processing img dddkvii21q0e1...*

Now that we have clearly laid out the concepts of the marginal product of labor and the law of diminishing marginal returns, we can delve into empirical information and data. Notice how the referenced post/comment did not actually reference any data to support its claims. Theory is not very useful if reality contradicts it. The main idea put forth is that WCs will ""ALMOST NEVER"" hire additional workers due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. We have established that the marginal product curve can shift upwards when additional capital (land, machines, tools, etc) is introduced. Again, this applies to both WCs and CFs.

France boasts one of the most highly developed and comprehensive legal frameworks for WCs in the world.

>SCOPs (French WCs) are not capital starved. Indeed, there is no statistically significant difference between the distribution of capital intensity of SCOPs and conventional firms’. SCOPs do not operate at inefficiently small scales and are in fact larger than other French firms on average. Estrin and Jones (1998) find no evidence of under-investment in SCOPs. Fakhfakh et al. (2012) found that average annual investment in SCOPs was either significantly higher than in conventional firms or not significantly different in all industries.[^(\[5\])](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jpeo-10-2022-0025/full/html)

>Univariate comparisons show that worker cooperatives are not smaller than conventional firms in all industries and are observed to expand their capital at least as fast as conventional firms.[^(\[6\])](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281599834_Productivity_Capital_and_Labor_in_Labor-Managed_and_Conventional_Firms)

SCOPs have the ability to expand its capital and hire more workers due to sufficient investment levels that are comparable to or even exceed that of CFs. Their being larger than CFs is a reflection of this fact. If the claim that WCs would ""ALMOST NEVER"" hire additional workers were true, why are French WCs larger? This trend is reflected in other countries: Spain and Uruguay WCs are larger than their respective CFs.[^(\[7\])](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf) Italian WCs are larger than CFs, and this is influenced by the goal of WCs to protect and generate quality employment. WCs exhibit a greater tendency to invest in social capital.[^(\[8\])](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371950257_Worker_cooperatives_in_Italy_legislation_prevalence_and_recent_trends) It is crucial to acknowledge that WCs are not necessarily solely profit-driven enterprises. Many are created to address the need for employment and income, and this is especially true during economic downturns.

*Processing img u2fpmba9vq0e1...*

A study of French and Spanish WCs measured their resilience during the 2008 financial crisis, finding that they tended to match or exceed survival and employment resiliency of CFs and that they also tended to recover more quickly.[^(\[9\])](https://www.ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/report_cecop_2012_en_web.pdf) In 2008, French WCs saw a 4.2% increase in its workforce while CFs saw a 0.7% decline. In Spain, the number of WCs decreased by 2.5% while the number for CFs decreased by nearly 15%.[^(\[10\])](https://ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/publications/files/eurofound_-_cooperatives_and_social_enterprises.pdf) These data points further corroborate the fact that WCs tend to be better for the employment level.

[The comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/AGItFrPL1f) mentioned earlier encapsulates in clarity the assumptions and therefore the level of ignorance required to arrive at the conclusion that WCs will tend to not hire new workers.

>If you must distribute ownership of a company equally among workers, it will ALMOST NEVER make sense to hire another worker. This is because any additional profit they can bring in is diluted by the share of ownership that other workers give up.

The assumption here is that WCs distribute ownership equally among workers. Reality is more nuanced. Many WCs employ a system of internal capital accounts that represent the individual equity ownership of each worker.^[[11]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://icagroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Internal-Capital-Accounts.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjpxcT7sdqJAxUAEFkFHTLQG4EQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Nz4uKfsOskcZHZiWHWCim) Washington State and New York are two U.S. states that have mentioned ICAs in their business laws.[^(\[12\])](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=23.78.090)^[[13]](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/cco/article-5-a/92/) The value of each capital account can be different. Someone who has worked at a cooperative for ten years may have an ICA that reflects greater value from earned bonuses and patronage over those years, while a worker who has just started out may have an ICA worth a lesser amount.

The other assumption here is that shares of ownership must be diluted to accommodate new workers, which is entirely inaccurate under the ICA model. Here is an example: John has an ICA worth $10,000, Kara has one worth $5,000, and Wilson has one worth $1,000. They decide to hire a new worker named Carl and grant them membership. Carl pays the $250 fee to open their ICA with the co-op, and so his ICA is now valued at $250. Over time, Carl's ICA value will rise as he earns profit sharing bonuses. At no point did the ICAs of any other worker have to be redistributed to accommodate Carl's entrance as a member. John, Kara, and Wilson continued to increase their own ICAs over time without having to transfer a cent towards Carl's account. Under the internal capital accounts system, existing workers do not have to dilute their equity ownership shares when admitting new members.

>If a company of 100 has a profit margin of $10k per employee, a new employee may bring in a profit of $9,500 (due to the [Law of Diminishing Marginal Productivity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-diminishing-marginal-productivity.asp)). This would reduce the *per worker profit margin* to $9,995. Why would a company ever hire this additional worker???

As noted previously, the law of diminishing marginal productivity applies to both WCs and CFs, and firms that invest in capital such as land, machines, and/or tools would shift the marginal product curve upwards, allowing for additional workers to be hired without resulting in negative marginal values. WCs are capable of investment to increase capital, and this is evident in the sources provided earlier. There is little or no empirical evidence to support the claim that the law of diminishing marginal productivity presents a greater growth constraint for WCs than it does for CFs. It is actually silliness that this person is presenting their own made up numbers and scenarios in a way that supports the conclusions they want. 

Additional assumptions that are made by the content include: assuming every worker becomes a member as soon as they are hired (and therefore included in profit sharing immediately), assuming every worker receives the same compensation, and assuming workers will always choose to pursue maximizing income per worker. These are actually theories originally postulated in The Firm in Illyria by Benjamin Ward.^[[14]](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808268) Subsequent empirical research has since emerged that contradict these theories. One study on plywood co-ops found that they place more weight on employment than earnings.^[[15]](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcec.1993.1027)

Sources that talk about these theories: [Dow 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apce.12194), [Pejovic 1992](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-1992/why-has-labor-managed-firm-failed&ved=2ahUKEwjHz9eZ0-2GAxVNkokEHRQPDYgQFnoECA4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw0M-sl274Ig8jvjWlBv-OZJ), [Putterman 2006](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/80125/1/522867464.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjHz9eZ0-2GAxVNkokEHRQPDYgQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw0OLluwXYQWq7cAT564LnQx), [Ellerman 2020](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPEO-04-2020-0012/full/html)

The WDV (Ward-Domar-Vanek) framework states that LMFs maximise income per worker, which assumes workers' are significantly self interested, with a lack of consideration for what is logical for the survival and success of the firm, as pursuing maximum income per worker may infringe on future success if less workers are hired in order to increase productivity and overall profit margin. Similar frameworks also assume workers will choose to enrich themselves short term, as well as shirk and freeride, ultimately leading to the closure of the firm, assuming a lack of long term reasoning from workers. This would theoretically lead to underinvestment as surplus is disproportionately distributed rather than reinvested. A glaring issue with the WDV framework to consider is that it assumes each worker receives equal patronage, which is not the case for many LMFs that distribute proportionately based on labored hours or other factors.

The ""backward supply response"" is also a theoretical model which states that a LMF's output would decrease as demand increases, as well as assume that workers may be fired in these situations. This, again, assumes workers do not employ long term rationale, instead hyperfocusing on short term income gain on a personal level. This dismisses the fact that LMFs typically adjust wages rather than employment when necessary, as employment is high in importance for workers.^([[1]](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf))

These frameworks have been found incomplete/inaccurate as more empirical literature on the model has been published and examined. In France, LMFs reinvests significantly more of its surpluses than is legally required,^([[2]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPEO-10-2022-0025/full/html)) and similar is found for firms in Italy.^([[3]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0885-3339(2011)0000012012/full/html)) There is little evidence of the backward supply response, and LMFs in general have significantly greater employment stability^([[4]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apce.12124)) and resilience to recessions.^([[5]](https://www.ess-europe.eu/sites/default/files/report_cecop_2012_en_web.pdf)) They survive longer than conventional firms,^([[6]](https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/1811/71538/1/OSLJ_V73N2_0219.pdf)) lending support to the fact that workers do consider long term goals and consider not only today's personal gain, but the sustainability of the firm for the future. Shirking is found to be low and mitigatable as workers are incentivised to self-monitor.^([[7]](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979399204600108?journalCode=ilra)[[8]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213297X21000082)) LMFs are actually comparably larger than conventional businesses, which is relevant to the theories that assume these firms will not hire at the same rate as other businesses.^([[9]](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/2020-10/worker_co-op_report.pdf)[[10]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371950257_Worker_cooperatives_in_Italy_legislation_prevalence_and_recent_trends))

Note that there are mentions of Yugoslav ""LMFs"" in support of the theory of inherent inefficiency. This is problematic considering the unique circumstances surrounding these firms, and I have listed sources about this in a previous comment.^([[11]](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/6w4fXkLxOv)) Essentially, drawing parallels between modern day LMFs and Yugoslavia's firms and assuming they're comparable would be fallacious and misled.

But wait, there's more. This person [has also claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/s/fQ2gCnyB99) that ESOPs (employee stock ownership plans) are cooperatives. This would be wrong. 

>ESOPs are not cooperatives–there is no direct ownership by workers of company stock – and there is no requirement to have the same democratic structure – employees do not generally get the right to “vote” the shares in their account (except in very specific, rare circumstances).^([[1]](https://cdi.coop/coop-cathy-worker-coops-esops-difference/#:~:text=ESOPs%20are%20not%20cooperatives%E2%80%93there,very%20specific%2C%20rare%20circumstances))

>The trust, not employees, is the legal owner of the stock. The trust (with the trustee being the shareholder of record) owns the shares in the ESOP trust; the employees are beneficial owners of shares in their ESOP accounts.^[[2]](https://www.esop.org/articles/esops-vs-employee-ownership-trusts-business-transition.php#)

>Every ESOP is essentially unique, and the same could be said for worker cooperatives. The most important difference between an ESOP and a co-op is in their definitions: An ESOP is a federally-regulated employee benefit plan that gives ownership interest to workers by allocating shares from the ESOP trust. A worker cooperative is a member-owned business entity in which worker-owners have a controlling interest, and who elect the governing body on a one-member-one-vote basis.^([[3]](https://www.esoppartners.com/blog/esop-vs-cooperative))",1,1734800543.0,u_Cosminion,0,1.0,False

It’s such a long story so here is the cliff note version:

I have always identified as queer. I am married to a man, we’ve been together 9 years married for 5. We have two children who are young, one is 4 and one under 1. 

Months before I met him, I met my best friend. We’ll call her Addison. Addison and I got very close very quickly. It started out just as a friendship. She had a boyfriend. When I started dating my now husband, her boyfriend and her split. She came to the conclusion that she also liked girls. Over the years we had gotten really close. A year or so in she admitted she may have feelings for me. I was already in a relationship for nearly a year. My home life was really scary, and unstable, just bad and I felt safe with my then boyfriend and I did (and do) love him. So I stayed. Right before I got married, she took me to a bar to celebrate a friends birthday. While in the bar she came onto me, asked me to “just try” and if I said no, she would continue her relationship with her boyfriend and not mention it again. I said not mentioning it doesn’t negate feelings, and she just tried to kiss me again. She was drunk and I felt like she was only doing it because of that, and I was literally about to get married (everyone invited, everything paid for, life imagined with this man, etc.) so I said no.

Fast forward to about 6 months ago. We’re still super close but platonically (I thought). She is now married to that boyfriend and has a kid. I have two. We got coffee like we do often and she, out of the blue, asked me if I regretted saying no at the bar that night. I had no idea how to respond because my sincere kneejerk reaction was: yes. I do regret it. I love my husband and my kids, but I do feel like I love her too. I always write it off as confusion on my side because of my trauma, sometimes I confuse platonic and romantic love. But with years of therapy and reflection now..I think I did confuse that love. But not with her. 

I asked her if she would do it again knowing what she knows now. Without a beat, she said yes, if she could still have her child, yes. 

I’ve been stewing on it for months. There is way too much at risk now: two families, three kids, two mortgages, bank accounts, etc. if you’re married with a family you may know how intertwined things get. But now I have this nagging feeling inside me like I’m missing something. 

If this were your life and your situation, what would you do? Would you blow up your life and start over, tell her you’re in love with her at the risk of ruining a nearly 10 year friendship and everything else in the process? Or, would you just push it down and carry on. ",6,1734800328.0,latebloomerlesbians,9,0.88,False

My mom is 49F and lives with her husband.
Growing up my mom worked a lot of jobs to keep food on the table pay bills etc.
My dad likes his gadgets so he always liked to have the latest gadgets.
My mom said that this got us into debt and so she had to work even more.

Eventually she left my dad and found a new man.

Everything fell apart a few months past.
I am in same sex relationship with my girlfriend 25F Rachel.
We met online and have met in person a few times since we live in different countries.

My mom has paid for these trips including air fare hotel and travel expenses.
This last trip we flew to Australia to see Rachel again .

My mom said this time Rachel HAD to pay towards the hotel cost and less than half of the activists, plus money towards food.
Rachel paid what she was asked but didn’t give my mom enough towards food she did offer to pay three times which is fair we were with her for two weeks.

Once she offered to pay in McDonald the other for ice cream and another for coffee.
I thought this was fair.
But my mom said this was not enough, because most of the checks, came to over $90 and she complained that Rachel only ordered the most expensive meal and didn’t eat it.

This is where, things got nasty.
One night we were leaving a restaurant, Rachel didn’t put her seatbelt on and my mom had set off and then  noticed, that Rachel had not put on her seatbelt in the car.
She exclaimed saying “Rachel” she didn’t raise her voice but that was all she said.
She said it was dangerous what if we had been in an accident? 
Which we clearly wasn’t.

Rachel was quiet for the rest of the ride.
This pissed me off.

So when we got to where we were going my mom forgot about it and was acting normal.
Rachel was not talkative and she went away to grab something.
While she was away my mom said what’s up with her? She’s creating an atmosphere!!? 

I was angry and said you should have kept quiet about the seatbelt!
My mom argued back saying it was common sense and that it was dangerous.

When Rachel came back I told her in front of my mom and I said to Rachel my mom says you are creating an atmosphere and what’s wrong with you?

My mom looked at me and asked me if I seriously just said that?

My mom thought it was inappropriate of me to do that, but I didn’t.

So we argued some more and I said you should not worry about what MIGHT happen.

From the first trip my mom was complaining about Rachel saying she was ungrateful didn’t say please or thank you.

Yes Rachel does not say thank you for EVERYTHING!

Since we have gotten home from the trip 
I have distanced from my mom.
Because I’m so angry with her!
THEN
My mom gave me money to get my dad a Christmas gift.
She asked me about it and I said yes I have it but I’m spending some on Rachel as I need to send her money for Christmas.
My mom was angry.
Because I apparently agreed it was for my dad.


My online friends say my mom is toxic and horrible.
I agree.

I can’t get a job because I suffer with anxiety I have felt like my mom try’s to say I should not be gaming all night and that my online friends aren’t real.

One online friend said I should go on welfare.
But my mom is against this idea.

1hjdum1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjdum1,Help with Short Rows,"Hi all! I’m working on my very first sweater. Now I’ve done socks and lace before, but for some reason these short rows on the neck are confusing. 

My pattern is Sprinkles on Top by Cozy Coffee Knits on Ravelry and I’m knitting the medium size. My image has the increases/instructions for my size highlighted in yellow. 

I got through short rows 1 and 2 just fine, and understand the Double Stitch on right and wrong sides, but as you can see in the photo I’m stuck on row 3, I’m confused by the line “knit up to 2 sts before last turn,turn” I’m not sure if that means knit the last two stitches next to my previous turn, or leave the two stitches before my last turn unworked?

Also, she states in row 2 to knit 16 sts up to my stitch marker (the sleeve section), but in the yoke row you can see where I actually have 17 stitches in the sleeve section. So I just did the 16, but I’m not sure that’s right. It’s also confusing because in row 1 she says knit 16 but makes no mention of slipping the stitch marker?

Further confusion comes from my limited understanding of short rows, which many videos have shown me that I’m supposed to knit the double stitch at the end of each row, but my pattern just says “pick up turned stitches as you go” after the short row section?

Someone else commented on the pattern page on Ravelry citing this exact issue and the designer did respond about a month ago stating she had a new pattern addressing the issue, but the new pattern only addresses sizes 0 months to 10 years :(

- You earn 1 star for every ₹400 (~$5 USD) spent in a single transaction.To reach Gold Level, you need to collect 25 stars in a year, which means spending ₹10,000 (~$120 USD) annually.
- Once you hit Gold, the benefits include a free drink on your birthday and occasional special offers, but they’ve stopped issuing the physical Gold Card here.

While I enjoy going to Starbucks for coffee, the requirement to spend ₹400 for just 1 star feels pretty steep. It makes me question whether the rewards are truly worth it, especially since there’s no actual Gold Card anymore.

1. I’m curious:How much do you need to spend in your country to reach Gold Level?
2. What does your rewards structure look like? Is it better compared to this system in India?
3. Do you feel like the rewards program is worth it overall?
4. Is there any way to make Starbucks bring back the Gold Card in India or receive it here somehow? (I know it’s a long shot, but worth asking!)Looking forward to hearing how Starbucks Rewards works in other countries. Would love to know if it’s any more rewarding elsewhere!Thanks!

TL;DR: In India, you earn 1 star for every ₹400 ($5 USD), and need to spend ₹10,000 ($120 USD) annually to reach Gold Level. They’ve also stopped issuing physical Gold Cards here. Is this worth it? How does Starbucks Rewards work in your country, and is it better? Also, is there any way to bring back or get the Gold Card in India?",1,1734799980.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False
1hjdsut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hjdsut/dressing_appropriately_while_traveling_foreign/,Dressing appropriately while traveling foreign countries,"I have a friend that dresses like she’s going to the club whenever she goes. It drives me crazy when we’re traveling abroad. I fully understand she’s allowed to wear whatever she wants and society is wrong for sexualizing her. I get that. 

However when we go to Asian countries and she doesn’t get let into historical sites for how she is dressed, she’s constantly stressed from being harassed by perverts, she’s constantly a victim to having up skirt photos taken, we’ve had to call security several times, etc. she will break down and sob when this happens. Yes it is super scary being preyed upon like that but when I tell her to just dress more modestly because we’re in a country that has a more modest dress code for everyday things, she gets super defensive and yells at us for not having her back and that she should be able to dress however she wants and men are the problem. It’s not just men that stare tho. 

She’s got a boob job and a big ass and loves to show off her figure and assets at all times possible. I just saw her post she wasn’t allowed into a memorial site because of her dress. And now she’s upset. I have another trip coming up with her to East Asia and I’m honestly dreading how she is going to pack. It’s not my problem I get it. Just venting it just annoying seeing Americans not respect other countries norms and then cry about their safety when it could have all been completely avoided in the first place. And no I do not blame victims for SA happening because of what they wore. It’s never okay to violate anyone because you think they are asking for it. She is not asking for anything other than to be able to freely dress the way she wants to. I get that!!! It’s just I don’t exactly feel great as a 95lb weak woman having my safety put at risk too because she refuses to cover her chest or ass cheeks up when we’re going to see a cultural site or grab coffee, etc. and then makes it everyone else’s problem to deal with. The last time it happened she wanted me to physically take someone’s camera when he was trying to get an upskirt photo. Instead I had to spend 30min talking to security for her because she was too shaken up and then she spent the entire rest of the hike paranoid looking over her shoulder convinced he was still following us. I love her but she’s borderline femcel and purposely does this shit to prove men are creepy. It’s not just men that stare at her tho. It’s everyone and she just thinks it’s because she’s white in a foreign country. No it’s because you’re dressed in a 2” mini skirt and platform stripper heels for a fucking nature hike where the average aged person is 65y/o.  ",1,1734799929.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

Sure, people wave, smile, or make small talk, but it feels so surface-level. It’s like no one actually wants to build a deeper connection.

For example, at my workplace, there’s a guy who’s friendlier than most. Sometimes, I’ll ask him to grab coffee or hang out, and he’ll agree. But I’ve noticed if I don’t initiate, he never does. It feels very one-sided, and this is coming from one of the “friendlier” people.

I get that colleagues aren’t automatically friends, but this feels like a whole new level of unfriendliness or indifference. It’s like everyone’s content to exist in their own bubbles without making any real effort.

Am I the only one who feels this way? Is this just a workplace dynamic, or are people in general becoming less open to forming friendships? How do you navigate this kind of environment?",1,1734799777.0,Life,5,0.67,False

I was diagnosed at 14, literally just days after my birthday, and as a teenager it didn't fully hit me that there were limitations I'd come up against as an adult with this lifelong disease. Sure, I was told all about my increased risk for just about every kind of health problem, and within a year of my diagnosis I had to have cataract removal in both eyes as a direct result of the disease, but the ""real world"" issues were kind of kept at bay for a while. But now, as an adult, my biggest issue with my disease is that I feel it holds me back in ways my non-diabetic, able-bodied friends and family members aren't. Not just that they can eat whatever they want without consequence, drive without worrying how many snacks they should bring if their blood sugar drops, traveling without needing to worry about medications or supplies, or take long walks without worrying if they'll go hypoglycemic. But I genuinely feel like being diabetic prevents me from taking a risk to find a job I'd actually feel fulfilled by. I'm working the job I am because it's got low physical requirements and the health insurance covers my needs. I'm a creative person who loves art, being around animals and plants, bookstores, and despite the issues of the service industry even just the cozy vibes of coffee shops and cafes. But would any of those career paths provide me with the insurance I need, or enough money to make up for what insurance wouldn't cover? Of course not. My non-diabetic, able-bodied friends were all able to take risks on lower-paying, little-to-no-insurance-provided jobs that they were passionate about because they didn't have to worry about going broke trying to afford a medication that literally keeps them alive. I'm sad that I can't say, ""Screw this, I'm going to go do something I'm actually passionate about!"" because my passions won't pay me enough or provide the care I'd need. Working in one of the local cafes I love, or the bookstore, or a greenhouse, or trying to make a living as an artist would basically be me setting myself up to go broke trying to afford my insulin and care, then dying when I can no longer pay for them.

And sure, I could try to go back to college and get a master's or a new bachelor's degree to maybe--only maybe--open more doors for myself, but who has the money for that? Not me, when even online programs are over $60k now. I couldn't even have afforded to spend one more year as a student only working part time because I turned 26 a year after leaving college, and at that point was no longer covered by my parents' insurance. Being covered by their insurance for as long as I was literally was the only way I was able to finish my degree without changing to a full time worker, part time student.

Long story short, so many things get me down about having this disease, but the worst is that I feel dependent on a job I barely like and feel no fulfillment in just because the insurance allows me to afford a medication that every able-bodied human gets from their body for free. I wish I didn't have to worry about that, and that my survival wasn't tied to my employment status. If it didn't cost so much for diabetics to remain alive, there'd be so many more opportunities not just for myself, but for all diabetics.",2,1734799731.0,Type1Diabetes,8,1.0,False

I look very young and mix easily with late 20s and 30s, many of them seem to be very careful with their money.

A few weeks ago I was on a tour and at lunch this 21 year old girl from UK asked to sit with me. We talked and I could tell she doesn’t have much money as she looked through the menu and only ordered a small soup which was the least expensive. When the bill came, I offered to cover hers which was only $5 and she seemed to be very thankful.

A few days ago I went out on a self organized tour with a few younger women. I got up early and bought everyone coffee. In the evening they didn’t want to spend money on uber and decided to take the bus, which took 2 hours with a transfer. It was cold and we were hungry and I wanted to get back to the hostel as soon as possible.

I wanted to share some reflections from my first time building a business, which happens to be an iOS app.

 It is called ""P Recovery."" It is an app that helps people quit p\**rn addiction, which has been a problem for me over the past 10-15 years. I am 30 now.*

  
*Some background on me: I have quite a few jobs in different industries—broadcasting, science, sports—and a love for investing, which really helped me build capital. But ever since around six months ago, I got engrossed in entrepreneurship and building a business of my own. I came across a video of someone who made an app that was successful and mostly gained users through organic social media marketing. I have a strong history in social marketing, so I thought I could add value with the skills needed here.*

  
Mobile apps have since boomed in the last 6-12 months, and so has the saturation of the market. My theme of quitting p\*rn also became saturated quite fast. However, after launching a week ago, I thought, if it helps one person and teaches me some lessons on business, then for an all-in $6,000 investment, maybe I will look back fondly at this experience.

# Some Learnings:

To caveat, I don’t actually believe too strongly in positives and negatives, as it’s all experience. However, for clarity, I felt it would provide more structure.

# Positives:

* Owning something that is mine is an awesome feeling. I make the final decisions on everything.
* The small successes: Even though I launched just a few days ago, one video hit 22k views on TikTok, which was a small win but felt like a pat on the back—a ""well done.""
* Creativity: This is probably my strongest trait. It has been great that this app reinforced that. I don’t have endless capital like other apps in this space that have grown much quicker, but I realized my creativity allows me to see opportunities that can turn into huge markets. It is only the last 6 months I see opportunities as business not just fun hobbies or things I can consume, but things i can own.
* Hiring people: It has been a great experience hiring a developer and designer and jumping on calls with them. This is all new experience I didn’t have before.
* Help from friends: One of my friends helped me film public interviews and sent the app to others to try out. It’s a great feeling to see friends supporting this project.

# Negatives:

* Taking losses to heart: When a video doesn’t perform well, my first reaction is *just quit; there’s no point in this* (of course, I didn’t, although I believe there is a time to give up when things are not working kind of giving myself 3-5 months). Mentally, it can be hard, as I have a history of things I start doing really well fairly quickly.
* Relying on someone else: I’ve always hated this, but relying on a developer—who, let’s be honest, isn’t being paid the most—meant the app, which was supposed to launch in September, ended up launching in December. Money does matter if you want to hire better employees.
* Not having instant success: This makes me question myself and my skills on a larger scale. It’s forced me to have tough conversations with myself and be extremely negative at times.
* Your business always being on your mind 24/7: I’m nonstop checking app downloads, troubleshooting issues, and stressing over problems. I knew it would be relentless, but the balance of fun and stress has leaned more toward stress so far—and we’ve only just launched.
* As much as I mentioned my friends’ help, at the end of the day, the buck stops with me. It’s my business, so they have no skin in the game. Being single, too, can make the hard days even harder.

None of the above is rocket science, but I wanted to just share my views. I’m super proud to have even launched. I’ve never done anything like this before, and I love having an idea and turning it into reality. My respect for business owners has grown tremendously. I now walk outside and non-stop think about how many businesses I use every day, study how much they charge, and go to coffee shops to speak with owners and get tips. It’s like seeing the world in a whole new way.

This is a great coffee maker. I usually drink one 12 ounce coffee. This has a few setting that I choose, both strong and the 1 to 4 setting in combination before hitting the start button. This makes the coffee brew slower so it comes out nice and strong. I am using about half as much coffee to brew what I was using with a different brand. The coffee is strong but the flavor is smooth. Every grind gets saturated due to the deep design of the way the filler sits in it. I also use the number 4 filter to preserve the reusable filter that it comes with.

My husband, 46M, and I, 39F, have been having marital difficulties on and off for a while. I work full time and his work schedule varies because he works for himself. He is a creature of habit and goes at least once a day to the same coffee shop in our city. This is the only coffee shop he frequents. I have also been going regularly for years and we go as a family with our child, 8M, as well. I am a rather private person. When we are having marital difficulties, I don’t really speak to many people about it. At most, if someone asks me specifically, I may just say something like “we’ve been struggling lately.” Sometimes, if my MIL asks me, we may talk about it a little more in-depth, because I know my husband has already told her some things. 
When my husband and I are having issues, my husband has informed me that he tells people at the coffee shop. And not just confiding in 1 or 2 people. He has told me that he tells EVERYONE. The baristas, the people sitting near him, etc. He tells them specifics. He shows them our texts, notes between us, and tells them things that I have said in anger that I am ashamed and remorseful for. I understand the need and desire to confide in people, but this seems excessive to me. I am a pretty insecure person, and I feel deeply uncomfortable going to this place anymore, which he says is “my fault, because he’s only telling them the truth.” I have no idea how he is presenting these things or who knows what. And he sometimes references this dynamic, saying things like “everyone agrees with me,” or “people couldn’t believe it,” or “we all had a good laugh.” I feel like it’s inappropriate for him to share all of these personal things with soo many people. I completely understand and encourage confiding in a couple people, but the fact that he’s sharing these things with so many people, including the baristas, and then insisting that’s the only coffee shop we can go to when we are together as a family leaves me feeling panicked, nauseous, embarrassed, insecure etc. I asked that he please only confide and tell these details to just a select few, and stop telling everyone. He got really angry and said that my asking him to do that was me attempting to isolate him. I don’t agree. So tell me, is requesting that he stop sharing all of the details of our marital difficulties with everyone isolating? AITAH?",3,1734798746.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

The *one tip* that made the biggest difference for me is dialing in a consistent **coffee-to-water ratio**. You can do this even with your drip coffee maker and the coffee you are using today!

A great place to start is **60g Coffee:1000mL Water** (3 grams of coffee for every 50 milliliters of water).

For precision and consistency, invest in a **kitchen scale with a timer**—as you progress in your coffee journey the timer will help you control brew time, unlocking the true flavors of your beans.

Experiment with ratios to find what works for you, and don’t be afraid to adjust based on your taste. Try 65g:1000mL if you are looking for a stronger cup or 55g:1000mL for a lighter one!

1hjd6s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hjd6s1/what_is_the_best_town_in_san_diego/,What is the best town in San Diego?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience living in San Diego for the past few years and tell you about what I think is the best area to live in or visit in this amazing city.

After exploring pretty much every neighborhood and coastal town in San Diego County, I can confidently say that La Jolla takes the crown as the best town in San Diego. Let me tell you why!

First off, La Jolla has this perfect mix of luxury and laid-back California vibes. The beaches here are absolutely stunning - from the famous La Jolla Cove where you can watch seals and sea lions lounging on the rocks, to the more secluded Windansea Beach with its incredible surf spots.

The village area is super walkable, filled with amazing restaurants (seriously, the fish tacos here are next level), cute boutiques, and art galleries. I love spending weekends just strolling around, grabbing coffee at one of the local cafes, and watching the sunset from Ellen Browning Scripps Park.

If you're into outdoor activities, you're in for a treat. The hiking trails along Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve offer breathtaking ocean views, and the snorkeling at La Jolla Shores is some of the best in Southern California. I've seen so many bright orange Garibaldi fish and even leopard sharks (don't worry, they're harmless)!

Speaking of activities, I recently discovered this awesome website where you can book all sorts of tours and activities in San Diego: https://athometouch.com/SanDiego. They have everything from guided kayak tours of the La Jolla sea caves to food tours in the village.

The weather here is pretty much perfect year-round, averaging around 70°F (21°C). Even during ""winter,"" you'll see people swimming, surfing, and paddleboarding. The microclimate here is slightly cooler than inland San Diego, which makes it especially pleasant during summer months.

What really sets La Jolla apart is its community feel, despite being an upscale area. You'll regularly see families enjoying picnics at Ellen Browning Scripps Park, couples walking their dogs along the coast, and locals chatting at the farmers market on Sundays.

For visitors, there's no shortage of things to do. You can check out the contemporary art at the Museum of Contemporary Art, visit the famous Birch Aquarium, or take a surf lesson at La Jolla Shores. If you're planning a trip, I'd definitely recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/SanDiego for some great tour options and local experiences.

While other San Diego neighborhoods like Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, and Coronado are fantastic in their own right, La Jolla just has that special something that makes it stand out. It's got the perfect balance of natural beauty, culture, dining options, and activities, all while maintaining its charming village atmosphere.

Sure, it's not the cheapest area in San Diego, but I truly believe you get what you pay for here. Whether you're looking to move or just visit, La Jolla offers an experience that's hard to match anywhere else in San Diego County.

So there you have it - that's my take on the best town in San Diego. What do you think? Have you visited La Jolla before? I'd love to hear about your experiences or answer any questions you might have about the area!",1,1734798159.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

A few were commenting on how disgusting it was.  He is now telling people it's saving the planet by keeping it from going to landfills.   🤔  He then proceeded to tell people that there is manure on our food.   He was trying to educate people on compost.  😂🤣😂🤣😂
Patrick the food you take that's fruits, veggies, herbs etc decomposes rapidly.  The card board does as well.  Many people who do organic gardening save scraps or if something has gone bad for just that.  You need a mix of what's considered browns (carbon rich) such as leaves, twigs, shredded paper which would be those card board boxes....you also need Greens (nitrogen rich) which is fruits, veggies, coffee grounds, tea bags or leaves, grass clippings and you will need water to facilitate the decomp process.  While you can use manure only certain manure can be used and it has to sit for a long time first.  Otherwise it's considered hot and can ruin your garden.   At any rate you can get sick eating rotten food.  You are not saving the planet Patrick.  You risking getting others sick is beyond low.  You are not very  intelligent either and neither are your followers who think it's ok.  It's against the law for a reason.   Going to a food bank is a better option...stop trying to be a martyr because you are far from it.   ",7,1734797790.0,tayhotrish,0,0.9,False

1hjd1f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1hjd1f3/how_do_i_forget_about_a_situation_like_this/,How do i forget about a situation like this?,"So. Normally after school, i was spending time at a club for youths (about 8-9). And i randomly started to talk with a girl. (We were both in 8 grade) And we bonded over talking about FNaF and generally talking about everything. (We were just friends) She didn't have access to almost any of the popular social media (stright parents) But she had bereal. So we communicated via this. 

Everywere i went in the club, she went after me. And even a girl said that we fit eachother well.

2 moths later, december. She became angry at me because of... ""Probably a rude joke i made"" (i didn't have any girl knowledge back then) And also one of my friends joined us. So we were a triple group. And they became very close. And because she was angry at me. She didn't really talk with me when we were 3. So i kinda became a third wheel. And then i went on Christmas holiday a few days later. (I also asked her on discord why she was angry at me. She answered ""It isn't in your interest"" So almost the entire holiday i was desperate and couldn't stop think about this situation. On bereal i was trying to make some Posts that would catch her attention. (Before she became angry, she always liked my posts. And then stopped) 

I was really scared, that this could be the end. It hurt, alot. But 3 minutes after new year 2024. She commented on my bereal ""I'm sorry, and I'm not angry at you anymore"" And i wrote ""new year, new you ig"" and it was fine again. The next day, the three of us were just chatting over discord. Everything was fine

And after the holiday, two of my classmates were at my house. We were just chilling. And they saw a drawing on my wall (which was a drawing that she made for me before the holiday). And they began to ask ""who is she"" with excitement. So the next day they went to the club, and met her (she was talking with our shared Friend way more than me) and yeah, nothing really happened this time (foreshadowing) 

(Me and that friend were and are best Bros (remember for later))

About January 15. Our shared Friend told me. That they became a pair. I was happy for them and stuff, but i was also sad. Because you know. Being the third wheel. (Aaand... I've had some feelings for her.)

I've heard him talk about it before, about their relationship. And he said that he liked her. Because she wouldn't jugde him for who he is (forget to mention that all these people in this story are mostly unpopular. Many called us ""NPC's"" i was called it as well.)

So after this situation, i was fr the third wheel. I was just sitting alone in the club, and just making ideas for some yt video's. BUT. Sometimes she would just walk to me, like if she saw i was uncomfortable with this. And talked with me for some minute's. We talked especially about music, because we had a similar music taste. She showed me Linkin Park, which is now one of my favorite bands ever.

February 2. The club had a LAN party. And the whole friend group was there. Including the 2 friends from school. And they began befriend her fr. 

Some things happened. She spend alot of time with. But. Us both had a vr with us. And she desperately asked if she could play on my vr. I was very annoyed im general. Because of sometimes when i wanted to start a conversation, she didn't wanna talk with me. So i said to her a few times. Why can't you play on his vr? And we we're like that about 5 minutes. At last, i just gave in and let her play.

Meanwhile she played Beat Saber. She asked me if ""I could hold her, so i could catch her if she would fall"" i didn't think much of that then, but now... (She is not that type of person, who would fall with vr glasses on)

And there was also a Pringle situation, someone gave her an unfinished tube of pringles, and i asked if i could get some for fun, she said no. And i pretended to be angry. But after 5 mimutes. She just came to me, and said that you could take the rest. I felt bad...

And then at last, when we were about to go to sleep, we were basically all besides eachother (also some other girls, which were the friends of hers, but she talked only with us) and we talked, and we slept. I couldn't sleep, and she couldn't either.  So me, her and the one from my class began to do some strange things. Because it was 5am, and we couldn't sleep. But i layed down. And after 2 minutes, she layed down aswell. But she layed very close to me. We were face to face, and even moved closer. We were looking at eachother. But the light's turned on, and we were asked to begin to get ready to get home.

Before we went home, i opened an ice coffee. And begin to drink it. And then she took the coffee from my hand, and drank it as well. (She mentioned to me that she didn't like coffee before)

The next 1 week we talked **alot** actually. But. The friend she was with, they didn't talk alot with eachother anymore. And he even told me ""bro, i feel like everything is breaking with her and me after the lan party"" 

In between the 3 week. She began to talk alot with one of  my classmates (the foreshadowing mentioned before) and they went along really well. They played together alot on discord and stuff. And in the club i wss with them also
The third wheel feeling came back, and it wasn't on that extent. And they even watched my yt video's together. It was heartwarming.

(One time when we were playing together, she said that she wishes we could be roommate's in the future.)

But. After the week. The whoel group had a joke on me, which was very VERY ANNOYING. And i hated that. She wasn't in the club that day, but they called her. And she also made the joke. Then... I broke, and shouted to her ""I HATE YOU"" And ""I DON'T WANNA KNOW YOU ANYMORE"" and unfortunately more. I walked away. And the group tried make things ok again. Didn't work

(I probably broke, because of all the frustration that accumulated because of the third feeling, and it was where i began to realize i maybe had some feelings for her)

And i also heard from them, that she cried because of this situation.

Already the next day, the group began to talk on discord. And i really wanted it apologize to her, because i felt guilty AF.

She wasn't open with me that much anymore.

Now she basically only talked that classmate of mine. First we just had fun with it, tried to make Valentine letters, because we thought that they maybe had feelings for eachother (the other relationship was fr done for)

But... At the end of the day. Me, the one that was in a relationship with her, and classmate 2 realized that she didn't wanna talk with us. We made a strike. We left the discord chat, and just weren't very friendly. 

(It was so brutal for me, that i even anonymously asked my dad about these types of situations)

The next day. She tried to apologize to me , because she fr felt guilt. She also send me a spotify link to the song ""vampire, Johnnie guilbert"" and she wrote also sorry to her ex (and nothing to the second classmate)

I didn't answer a day. But the friend that talked with her, convinced me to make it good again. And i did. I made a new group on discord. And it was almost fine (her ex and her were fine at first, but he broke entirely, and they able to talk to eachother without a person in between)

The 20 of February, the club went to a jumping center. It was the first time i saw her, since the ""boycott"" situation.

She instantly sat Besides me, and started to talk with me. But when we actually arrived at the jumping centre, she mostly alone. I asked her why didn't stick with me and her ex. And she said ""because i wanted to be alome"" 

She was Walking with another boy, which was also im our friend group, but not to that big of that extent.

There were ziplines in the centre, and me and her ex went to them. She went up to us. There were many people. She cut the line to be before us. But there was only one piece of gear left, so we needed to wait. She asked if she should wait until we get the gear. I kept Quiet, and he said ""We don't care"" then she went without a word, i feel very bad about it

But before we came into the centre, she asked me ""what do you think about my hat?"" She had a goofy hat on actually. So I told her for fun ""you look like a hobo"" she **SLAPPED** me, but had a laughter after

We also made some photos together, when we were about to go back to the club:)

When we came back, my classmate came by, and we played and talked. I had also talked with him before. He told me that he actually had a crush on her.

So we made a plan, that im gonna ask while he hides somewhere. And then i asked her ""do you have a crush on him"" and she told me ""definitely no"" i told him that, but we were skeptical if she told me the Truth.

He invited her to a friend group of his brother and his friends (discord) and they played alot. There was a big argument again between the other classmate, and her ex on a bereal group. I and the the first classmate tried to stop it. And it went... Yeah

The classmate that had a crush on her, had confessed his love. He got rejected in a respectful way. 

February 29. She left all of our discord groups. She only stayed on bereal, and eventually. She also leaves that.

I tried to apologize to her. I tried also ask her some questions. But she didn't wanna answer.

And i told her ""if you don't wanna talk to me, you could just block me, ane she did. And didn't unblock since""
 
The end.. well, not quite

Me and the second classmate were both on that server, and we tried to communicate with her. Didn't end that good

And she also for the most part didn't come to the club anymore.

But, me and her ex became friends wirh a girl, that was her old friend of hers. 

It was may. And we didn't talk alot about her. (Even though i couldn't stop thinking about her)

Then her friend casually mentions that ""she had a crush you since oktober, aka when we became friends"". I've began to laughing, in pain that is. (And it was confirmed)

All the thoughts came back, that basically meant that i was the fault for everything. And i also found out, that she cried many times because of me. I basically friend zoned her without realizing.

After that, i tried to add her on bereal again. She added me back. Actually, (she didn't add anyone back)

I made an indirect emotional post, so she can maybe notice it. But after a week, she unadded me again.

She was in the club, and i asked her why she added me, ahe said ""for fun""

Now it's june. And i was randomly looking at my yt channel. And then i see that she subscribed to me. I WAS IN DISBELIEF!!! (I fell out my chair when i was that)

6 days i was wondering why. And finally i broke myself, and made an alt account, and commented on one of her video's 

I wrote a long sentence, basically saying ""sorry for everything, i miss you""

She wrote ""I'm sorry for being a diva""

And i said it's fine. 

In august she randomly added me on roblox. I wrote to her. No answer, i deleted her again.

I added her in november, she accepted. And i wrote again to her in december. No answer yet

On side note, after she left. The friend group fell apart. 
I felt depressed since then. Really, i im more introverted than i was before.

I swear, i cannot forget about this situation. It still hurts.
