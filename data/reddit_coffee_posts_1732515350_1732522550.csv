They smell and taste sweet, but they’re $39 for a 1kg bag (regularly $49), plus $9.95 shipping.

Are there higher-rated light roast beans available in Melbourne or that can be shipped interstate? I’m new to light roasts and want a good one for cold brews and occasional espresso. ",1,1732521924.0,AustralianCoffee,0,1.0,False

It wasn't my career or my degree, but it was a hobby of mine. I made some flac tunes with different programmes and instrumental audios, posted them onto my Geocities homepage. It was just a fun thing to do, pretty much like Nintendo. 
One day, I get an email in my inbox. I won't disclose any names due to agreements that I've signed but let me tell you this - it was a huge company. THE big company when it came to CD production back then.
I spilled my coffee all over my keyboard due to the surprise and flatter that someone there had found my hobby homepage and not only liked what they heard but also decided to contact me.

My social circle widened up and I was sometimes hired by them to adjust some tunes, listen and review some instrumentals and even add in some extras. They asked me if I wanted to be credited but I've always been a laid-back dude who likes his privacy. So not to brag but, some bridges and parts of an instrumental that you've heard back in the days we're made by me. I started hanging out with these music producers and could even call them my friends.

One night me and some guys sit in the studio outside of the recording room and enjoy a pizza when they suddenly leave the table after a knock on the door. I listen to their voices to get a grasp on what's happening.
""Now? Wasn't it 8 AM?"" one of the guys said to a woman's voice I could barely make out. ""Well this is awkward"", my other friend says.
I recognize the female voice immediately when I hear how she gets closer to the studio room. No effing way dude, I think to myself.

It's so surreal seeing celebrities in real life. It's like our brains are so acclimated to see them on tv or in magazines that our brains must think that they are just a feature inside a screen or a photo, yet there she was, Christina Aguilera.

She looked surprised when she entered the room followed by some of her team, wearing jogging pants, a t shirt and her hair in a bun under a hot pink cap.
""Hi?"", she said in a confused tone, looking at me eating a pizza.
""Oh, I...-"", she interrupts with a giggle; ""Nah, it's okay! I need a big coffee before anyway. My latest tour really took a toll on me"". I see her team getting seated and starting to prepare the boards and the computers, making it clear with their body language that I am not welcome to stay.

I look at my friend's who just shrug their arms and we start to empty the table.
The long hallway we're in with different studios, some bathrooms and a kitchen as well as some office rooms is really long. We dispose of our waste in the garbage room when we hear the coffee machine, all the way from the kitchen.

That is one fast coffee brewer, I think, as the bubbling & hissing roar of steam escaping the empty water container vibrates throughout the building, indicating that the brewer has one pot ready. 
""I need a cup as well if I'm not gonna fall asleep behind the wheel"", my producer-friend says. Halfway through the corridor, we see Aguilera leaving the kitchen suddenly turning completely red all over her face when she sees us.
""Is there any coffee left?"", my friend asks.
""They're... Uh, not yet"", she says, looking away. As we approach the door to the kitchen she abruptly stop us. 
""So, who's this?"", she asks one of my friends about me.
""He's that Geocities guy"", my friend informs her meanwhile giving her a strange look as to why she stops us from entering the kitchen. She twitches her body and legs, almost stimming, except it's only her bottom.

""Ooh!"", Aguileras eyes shines up a bit and she tells me that I could go really far. 
I peek inside the kitchen behind her. The coffee machine is completely empty in a state it was when we arrived. Not a single drop of condence or steam. 
What was bubbling like that?
Then, the stench hits me right in the face. It's almost like sewage and I put my fingers over my nose.
""What on earth is this vile smell?"", I ask and Aguileras face immediately turn red as she almost cuts me off mid air ""something with the drain"", she says in a short tone and doesn't wait a second to change the subject, like we would forget the smell if we continued to talk about the future where computers and robots will make music instead of real humans.
It almost looks like she's dancing when she try to wiggle as secretly as she can, I start to wonder if she's in pain.

Then, it hits me, and I get a big smile all over my face which make Christina even more red.
She knows that I knows, and not only I, but even my friends has started to realise. They start to burst out in laughter. An infecting laughter and suddenly all of us laugh.

""Mexican food, huh?"", I say.
""Claro que si!"", Christina responds and now giggles. She excuses herself to the bathroom.

My friends prepare the coffee brewer and open the window in the kitchen and I tell them I'll just make a call. We hear several loud thumps from the bathroom and we all laugh. Such a contrast to the formal and dry production team of hers without a trace of a smile on their almost arrogant faces.
But instead of going to the wardrobe, I stand outside the women's bathroom where Christina is in, put my ear to the door. 

I hear the thumping sounds of her farts leaving her anus echoing inside of the porcelain chair.
They are so wet and loud that they mostly resemble a coffee machines hissing sound.
'BWAAAB-PFFF!' followed by a 'BWAP-AP-AP-AP' and more hissing 'PFFF's, I picture her anus stretching open with the fissure, letting out her foul smelling gas. Between the small gap of the door and the door frame, the meaty aromas of carne and hot chili emerges with her natural gut aroma and gut bacteria trapped with the smell of a generic bathroom smell spreading up my nostrils. 

It just keeps on going.
'BFFAAAP' followed by Christina Aguileras heavy breathing. 

It must feel so comfortable to finally release all that gas pent up inside. Her stomach must have felt like a balloon about to explode any second, to then finally release it all, feeling the air scratch the sensitive walls inside of the anus or tickling them when it's bubbling out in wet and fizzy sounds.
I wonder for how long she has been letting the gas marinate inside of her gut by holding them in. Being surrounded by people and paparazzi all of the time, I bet that all famous women must have trained their guts and intestines to hold a lot of gas. I'm not exactly jealous of their life.

Inside the bathroom, I hear her breathing heavily as she lets out every little cloud of foul smelling gas trapped inside.
My mind wanders off to science, with all the farts and gas that she's letting out, how many litres would it be if the gas turned into a liquid form?
Suddenly picturing a whole soda bottle filled with a light brown buttery fart liquid. Christina Aguileras fart liquid. Would I drink it? Maybe. It is after all Christina Aguilera.

It gets silent after a while and I hear a relieving ""Aaaah!"". The tap opens and the scent particles of soap start to emerge in the fart filled air, I guess it's an attempt to hide the stench but it's pretty pointless as even her production theme probably can smell it by now. I hear my friends laughter and cough from the kitchen. Before Christina turns off the water, I walk into the kitchen to my friends.

Christina Aguilera comes to kitchen, now looking very relieved and with her stomach less swollen and bloated. I pour up some coffee in a mug to her.
I ask her if she wants creamer, with a horrifying look on her face she almost shouts ""no!"". We start to laugh, again.",1,1732521808.0,celebfartfantasies,0,1.0,False

He said he didn't want to leave the house this weekend even though I asked if we could go out and take the kids somewhere. My mom came over to our house on her birthday. I had a $2 coupon for a coffee shop too so I asked my mom if she wanted to go get coffee and then go to Marshalls, my treat, and the kids wanted to come as well. Before I left, I told my husband my plans. He was okay with it and warned me not to spend too much. I ended up spending $19 at the coffee shop and went over $43 at Marshalls because we all found something we wanted. I got a new TJ Maxx card in the mail months back. It was card I had opened several years ago and since we never really shop I hadn't activated yet. So when we went to checkout it declined and was going to use a new card but the cashier suggested I activate it because I would receive 10% off plus free gift bags, so I did that even though I was embarrassed and there was a line behind me. I was feeling stressed throughout the whole shopping experience. Marshalls is always crowded and the aisles are too narrow. I was almost having to back out of every aisle I went into pushing a cart around. I was feeling a bit more stressed during and after checkout and then even more stressed dealing with traffic and the amount of inconsiderate drivers on the way back home. My mom had a nice time with me and the kids were happy so that eleviated some of my stress. After my mom left though, I get a lecture from my husband saying that I always end up spending too much money and questioning why I opened up a brand new credit card that he now has to keep track of. Hours later when it's starting to get dark outside and I'm down in the living room relaxing and watching a show he asks passive aggressively, ""wasn't that gift card for both of us?"" I responded that yes it was but that I had let him know my plans before we went to the store and that he should have spoken up if he had wanted me to get him something. He knew it was my mom's birthday and that I was planning on getting her something. Like seriously you're going to be bitter and hold a grudge? So he's mad all evening and wouldn't really talk to me, just holed up in our bedroom in the dark. I gave our youngest a bath, brushed his teeth, and got him ready for bed. Our youngest is super needy and needs one of us to be in his room while he goes to sleep. Otherwise he chases us around the house crying or wants to sleep with us in our bed. My husband tried to get him to go to sleep and come back over to our bedroom. However, to say the least this has put a strain on our relationship. He mostly wants my husband to be with him during that time. Yet I'm the one he gets mad at. He works from home and gets to sleep in while I get up at 4:30 every morning and drive into work. Tonight he says, ""well, I guess I'll go to bed with (our son) tonight. See you tomorrow."" I've been so depressed for years. It feels like we're falling apart. I've been with this man since we were in our teens. I hate that we fight about stuff like this. To me it's not worth the strain on our relationship to have these kinds of fights. Usually when I come from work he's in a meeting so I can't say hi to him and ask him how his day was or he's got his headphones on and can't hear me when I'm talking to him. He gets overly dramatic and breaks things once or twice a year too whenever I bring up issues like that. Last week he broke his headphones when he confronted me about me being upset. I said you've been in your own world for the past few weeks and I felt like I'm invisible. Can you please not use your headphones so much. He then proceeded to take his headphones off and rip them apart. He then said ""These were $100. I can go get my tablet and break it too if you want. That was $1,000."" AITH here?  I'm in a bad place right now and it sucks. ",2,1732521443.0,AITH,3,1.0,False
1gzdtvn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gzdtvn,Fragrance haul and seller reviews of u/mebankai and u/Decantosaurus,"In light of recent negativity and bad seller experiences, I thought I would share a great experience I've had with u/mebankai and u/Decantosaurus after buying a bunch of fragrances from them. 


u/mebankai (Jatin) was quick to respond, very polite and helpful and even recommended a couple of fragrances which turned out to be bangers. I originally wanted to get 10 ml decants of Eros, Eros Flame, Dylan Blue, ADG Parfum and CDNIM (kyuki CDNIM to compulsory hai). He also recommended Ibrahim Alquraishi's French Tobacco (which got me the first experience of a girl chasing me on her scooty for 1-1.5kms to ask which frag I was wearing) and Cullinan Diamond Iris which was also a pleasant surprise. 

The presentation was alright, bottles were sturdy, but I did have some issues with the sprayers on 2 (they get stuck sometimes when letting go). Rates were reasonable and shipping was borne by him. Packaging was excellent with no leakages or damage and the box was shipped within 4 days of the order. All in all 10/10. Bonus points for being an anime fan and recognizing my Log Horizon wallpaper 😁


u/Decantosaurus (Pragna) takes a bit longer to respond. Initially I thought it was because I order just a few days before Diwali so I figured she was busy with festive preparations and all. But overall she takes a day or two to reply. She's very sweet and helpful, gave me a bunch of personal recommendations after I told her what kind of frags I usually like, gave me a 300 rupees discount on the La Yuqawam decant and also threw in a complimentary 5 ml of Hawas Black. 

I ordered 10 ml decants of the following from her : Rasasi Daarej, Rasasi Hawas, Rasasi Hawas Ice, Rasasi Shuhrah, Rasasi LaYuqawam, Lattafa Qaed Al Fursan, Lattafa Asad, Lattafa Najdia, Lattafa Ramz Silver, Lattafa Khamrah Qawha, Lattafa Fakhar Black, Maison Alhambra Tobacco Touch, Afnan 9 pm, Afnan Rare Carbon, Rue Broca Theoreme, Al Rehab Choco Musk, Al Rehab French Coffee, and Armaf Tres Nuit. The order was a bit delayed due to Diwali rush, but still shipped within a week so no complaints. 

The packaging was excellent, there were no leakages or damage. The decant bottles she uses are like test tubes with ml markings so super useful to know how much juice you're getting. Only complaint I have is that the test tube-like bottles feel and sound very delicate and handling them always stresses me out because I'm afraid I'll break them from holding them too tight. I had also ordered decants of Rasasi Fattan and Afnan SNOI but she ran out of them so my order was shipped without the two. She offered a refund immediately when I contacted her, but I chose to have the two missing ones shipped later when she gets them again (haven't gotten them yet) so no complaints there. All in all, great experience, I'd give her a full 10/10 and I hope she can respond a bit more promptly in the future, but I do understand that everyone's busy with life and its not always possible. 


As for the haul, I haven't yet tried all of them properly but some standouts for me are as follows : 

1. Hawas and Hawas Ice : Everyone and their mother has probably sniffed this by now, so I won't go into detail. It's fresh, fruity, and refreshing. I was surprised because I usually don't like fruity or sweet fragrances because they can get too dense or cloying but these two feel super light and breezy. Loved the Ice more than the OG, it's a fresher and slightly blue-er take on the original. 9.5/10

2. Shuhrah : I've read reviews of people describing this as an ashy, smoky, floral scent, like a lit cigarette held in a perfumed hand. Initially I was only getting a strong floral scent of roses and chameli, but no smoke or tobacco. After a couple of days though, the tobacco note starts appearing in the middle notes and drydown. I'd give this a 9/10 if it didn't have the slightly sour, ketchupy tomato leaf note because it spoils the drydown for me a little. 7.5/10

3. Rare Carbon : I read somewhere that this is a kinda-sorta clone of Ombre Leather and I gotta say, if this is even 50% close to the original, I can fully understand the hype for the OG. This smells like a rich gentleman in a crisp suit smoking a cigar on a leather couch. 10/10 from me. 

4. La Yuqawam : Slightly sweetish and fruity opening and settles into a nice leather heavy scent. Very similar to Rare Carbon in the vibe it gives but slightly fresher. 9/10

5. Theoreme : A nice citrus blast in the opening which gives way to a pleasant and slightly woody drydown. I accidentally layered Rare Carbon with Theoreme while experimenting, and the resulting fragrance was 100% what 15 year old me imagined Pierce Brosnan's Bond smelled like. Refined, elegant, classy, old money. 10/10

6. Tres Nuit : This was my favourite one by far. It opens with a nice herbal and citrus blast, which feels fresh and airy, like walking in a garden with fresh cut grass, but very quickly progresses to a calming sandalwood drydown which heavily reminded me of how Vicco Turmeric smells after a few hours. 11/10

7. IAQ French Tobacco : Very tobacco forward opening with hints of cinnamon and vanilla in the drydown. Smells like rolling fresh cut tobacco leaves into a joint. Also caused a girl to chase me on her scooty to ask which frag it was because she loved it (😁) and wanted to get it for her boyfriend (😩). 9/10

8. French Coffee : This smelled like I walked into a premium coffee store and took a large sniff of a pot of freshly brewed coffee. Super strong, super long lasting and just two sprays was enough to create a beastly projection which made all my friends suddenly have the urge to drink a nice hot cup of coffee. The dry down smells like kopiko candy, if you've ever had some you'll know what I mean. 9/10 

9. Qaed Al Fursan : Like a punch in the face by a pineapple. It's like CDNIM if CDNIM was sprayed on a pineapple before being hit in the face by it. Surprisingly doesn't have the harsh synthetic opening that everyone *loves* in CDNIM. 8/10

10. CDNIM PP : CDNIM PP. It's very CDNIM, the opening is reminiscent of a CDNIM mixed with a CDNIM and CDNIM drydown. CDNIM/CDNIM.

Disappointments : 

1. ADG and Dylan Blue for their notoriously poor performance. I was smelling both for only about half an hour after which I really had to put my nose to my clothes or wrist to smell it. And it wasn't nose blindness because I verified with a 4-5 others and they couldn't smell it on me past an hour either. 6/10

2. Eros : I've seen it being super hyped as one of the sexiest scents of all time and in many top 10 lists but I just didn't like it. It felt super dense, cloying, clingy and headache inducing. Eros Flame was a lot better because it has more mandarin/orange in the opening so it feels slightly fresher. 6/10",1,1732521401.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,0.6,False

It's not recent news but I was unaware until my wife got a survey in the mail asking about it.

I think this is very problematic. Why is every municipality thinking they control the supply of money and should set a minimum wage?

For example, as the CEO of an unfunded start-up, I ran an experiment with signing people up with part time, flex, remote equity contracts. Our payment platform, Deel, was unaware of these municipal minimum wages and how they affect even 1099 contracts. Imagine hiring one person on an equity contract with minimum wage attached for compliance reasons, and someone comes along and costs nearly 25% more because they live in a slightly different location.

I am not rich, the company operates off of a loan I gave it, and this is a substantial amount of money to me during a time I have been financially pressed.

For remote workers, the minimum wage is based on where you ""perform the work"", so your minimum wage may be different if you drive to a coffee shop vs do it in your home. 1099 contractors are not exempt from minimum wage laws when there is an ""employee"" relationship, meaning they're hourly, are assigned work, and you vet the quality of their work.

This creates an arms race where you're having to pay against the most expensive locality.

For example, here's the reason given:

Cosponsored by Councilmembers Rod Dembowski, Teresa Mosqueda, and Jorge L. Barón, the measure is aimed at lifting wages in unincorporated areas where wages lag behind nearby cities with much higher minimum wage standards. For instance, Skyway is held to the state minimum of $16.28 while neighboring Tukwila has a $20.29 minimum wage.

Oh yeah, the law calls for documentation and other crap, and has tiers based on revenue and employees.

I also disagree it's remotely fair that a worker who has to follow a schedule and drives to work gets the same minimum wage as a worker who logs in on their own schedule and spends the time multitasking at their house.

Lastly, I'm skeptical any sort of science or study went into these numbers. Years ago, I sat in on a city council meeting and saw a member pull a number out of their butt, vote on it, and passed the motion. Would I be wrong in thinking this went similarly, at least when it came to picking these numbers?",0,1732520926.0,SeattleWA,4,0.14,False

1gzdpv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1gzdpv8/thinking_about_switching_off_strattera/,Thinking about switching off Strattera,"
I’m a 18 (m) and I’ve been on strattera for about a year now at 70 mg. I was diagnosed very early, at 7 years old, and took vyvanse until middle school, which i switched off of due to dietary reasons, as well as it not working as long as I preferred. Over my time in highschool up until my senior year, i usually didn’t take straterra consistently, especially on the weekends, leading to dampened effects. When i finally started taking it everyday my senior year, my condition improved well, and this was also about the time i started drinking coffee and started getting into caffeine heavily. Near the end of the year, the drowsiness that started when i started taking it got worse. I attributed it to bad sleeping habits and kept going. I started uni this year, but it feels like the medication stopped working. Furthermore, despite getting a good amount of sleep (7-9 hours). I’m still drowsy most of the day, which can make it hard to get through most lectures. The drowsiness doesn’t occur when i forget to take starters, so i was thinking about moving to a stimulant. I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow, and I don’t know how to approach talking to my doctor about this without seeming like I’m looking for amphetamines or something to deal, like I’ve seen on campus. Does anyone have any advice?",1,1732520906.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1gzdppe,https://i.redd.it/uyaz9gi3603e1.jpeg,How are motion design ads optimized for mobile viewing?,"Swipe Right for Stunning Visuals
Let’s face it—our phones are like the VIP club for content. If your motion design ad doesn’t perform well on mobile, it’s like showing up to a black-tie event in flip-flops. Mobile optimization isn’t just a feature; it’s the dress code. And motion designers? We’re the tailors, stitching every pixel to perfection for those tiny screens.


---

Vertical Is the New Black
Remember when horizontal videos ruled the world? Yeah, neither do mobile users. These days, if your ad isn’t vertical, you’re asking viewers to do the unspeakable: rotate their phones. And guess what? They won’t. Mobile-optimized motion ads are designed to fill the entire screen, so viewers are completely immersed. It’s like saying, “Forget everything else—this coffee machine deserves your attention.”


---

The Attention Span Olympics
Fun fact: You have about 3 seconds to grab someone’s attention on mobile. That’s shorter than it takes to sneeze. So, motion design ads waste no time. The action starts immediately—text flying in, product spinning, and colors popping like fireworks. Every frame has one mission: hook those thumbs before they scroll on to cat videos.


---

Sound Off, Visuals On
Let me ask you this: How many of you watch ads on mute because you’re in public pretending to be productive? Exactly. That’s why mobile motion ads are crafted to be just as engaging without sound. Captions, kinetic typography, and visual storytelling step up to the plate. It’s like watching a silent movie but way cooler—and, let’s be honest, with better graphics.


---

The Thumb Test
Here’s a fun game: open a mobile ad and try to click the CTA with your thumb while holding a coffee. Too hard? Ad fail. Mobile-friendly motion ads are designed with “the thumb zone” in mind. CTAs are big, bold, and easy to tap—no finger gymnastics required. Because if your audience has to work for it, they won’t.


---

Small Screens, Big Impact
Some people think small screens mean limited creativity. Oh, how wrong they are. Mobile motion ads are where creativity thrives! From split-second animations to layered transitions, every detail is designed to make a massive impact in a compact space. It’s like the Michelangelo of motion design, painting masterpieces on 6-inch canvases.


---

The Swipe-Up Symphony
And let’s not forget the grand finale: the swipe-up. It’s the holy grail of mobile ads, the moment when your ad turns into action. A perfectly timed motion design ad guides the viewer’s thumb like a conductor leading an orchestra. By the time they reach that swipe-up, it feels like the most natural decision in the world.


---

Wrap-Up: The Mobile Motion Dance
So, what’s the secret to optimizing motion design ads for mobile? It’s understanding the audience, respecting the platform, and designing ads that move—literally and emotionally. When done right, they’re not just ads; they’re experiences tailored for the swipe-happy world we live in. And remember, when it comes to mobile, your ad isn’t just fighting for attention—it’s competing against every meme, text, and TikTok on the planet. Make it worth the swipe!

","Me (F28) and him (M28) started talking almost for 3 weeks now. We talked about us not ready being in a relationship since we just had our breakup with our own partner couple months ago. We both came from toxic relationship. Mines ended 7 months ago, his was 3 months ago. We had s*x on our first dinner after a week of talking and we stayed in the hotel to spend the night together and every minute was amazing. I thought this is just fwb or just one night stand. But he continues to talk to me and he got more closer and open about his life story. So basically, relationship ( what ever we had since day 1 leveled up. 

After 2 days, he keep asking me if i caught feelings for him. I never say yes or no , I came up with reasons bc if I say yes, what's the point if he's not also ready to jump in a relationship which i understand bc he's breakup was still fresh and still need to heel. 

Since he keep asking me about if I have feelings for him after the s*x for the last 3 days after that Saturday night. 

I asked him to meet me in person bc I have important to ask him. He drove 40 mins to be just to talk to me in person. I asked him eye to eye, if did he catch feelings for me. And he looked at me and said yes a little.  I told him I'm not gona make this awkward or push you to have relationship with me.

But I'm scared now, bc i know one of these days. He will ask me if I catch feelings for me. 

Tbh, he's such a great person, gentle man, we talked on the phone more than 30 mins to hours everytime he has extra time at work.  He updates me everything he do, he talks about his family to me, he remember what i like and he also ask questions about my life. he sounded like he's interested to me. What i feel right now is that, I care about him, I brings joy and happiness everytime we text or calls, I'm ignoring the guys on my dms . He makes me so happy on the phone or in person.  He also visits me at work brings me coffee. I like him and I'm attracted to him. I'm catching a Lil bit of feelings for him.  But I'm scared of he asked me, and i know the fact that he is not also ready but my door is open for him if he asks me to be his gf. But at the same time, he wants to focus on his career and i don't think he's ready any time so to ask me to be his gf.

But do you desperately want to start saving? These 100 days money saving challenge may be the best way to make saving a part of your routine. 

Challenges make things fun and let you accomplish saving goals in real time. While the internet is flooded with hundreds of moneys saving challenges, the best is the one that fits your budget and yet lets you save a significant amount. 

These 100 days money saving challenge helps you to save $5000 by the end. However, if that seems to exceed your saving capacity, you can customize daily savings as per your finances and willingness.

# How To Save $5000 In 100 Days? 

Did the viral [100 envelope challenge](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/100-envelope-challenge/) just cross your mind? Well, this challenge is a similar one but with a few interesting twists. 

We understand $5000 may be a too aggressive saving goal for many. But as said earlier, you can customize your overall and daily saving goals. If you’re beginning your savings journey, any suitable amount would be a milestone. 

There can be two ways to save during this challenge:-

# 1. Fixed Savings Approach 

If you are determined to meet a specific savings goal over a pre-decided duration, this approach would be a great choice. Divide your goal amount for example it’s $5000 for this challenge into equal portions for your daily or weekly savings. 

From day 1 to 100, put aside $50 each day without fail. Make sure to maintain a tracker to see how far you’ve come. These savings can be in the form of cash or an automated transaction into your [emergency fund](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/emergency-fund/) savings account. Choose an amount that you can easily stick to for 100 days.

# 2. Variable Savings Approach 

If saving a fixed amount each day seems difficult, you can take up the variable approach. This one offers you flexibility with your daily or weekly savings. While you still need to put some money aside everyday for 100 days, you can decide a different amount when you want. 

**Want to make it more spontaneous and fun?** 

Fill a jar with chits that have random amounts from $25 - $100 (or more) on them (can be a different range based on your preference). Every day pull out a chit and set aside the amount mentioned on it. 

Well, your saving doesn’t have to be limited to the amount on these chits, you can always save a little more when you wish. You can also use a number generator to save time on creating chits. Although make sure you have a tracker to guide with your daily/weekly progress. 

Calculate your weekly savings to make sure you save enough to meet your total saving goal. Again, you can either keep your savings as cash or make a transfer to your savings account.

# Getting Started 

As crucial it is to save a portion of your income, it can often seem difficult. Now that you are taking a step towards improving your money saving habits, begin correctly.

# Where To Keep Your Savings? 

One of the major concerns is finding where to store your savings. While a piggy bank or a secret box is absolutely fine, making your savings easily accessible may tempt you into spending them the next time you get a chance. 

We suggest opening a special, [high-yielding savings account](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/high-interest-savings-account-rates/) instead. You won’t have an excuse of having no cash in hand and your savings will be safe from impulse spending. 

If you intend on saving a fixed amount every day, make use of the automated savings feature. This way your money will automatically get added to your savings before you get a chance to spend it on something unnecessary.

# Customize The Challenge As Per Your Preferences 

Adjusting the saving challenge as per your preferences and needs increases the chances of you sticking to it till the end. Saving something is better than spending every penny in your wallet (or bank account). 

Moving ahead with the variable saving approach lets you choose a different saving amount each day or each week according to current or upcoming financial necessities. 

Suppose you start the 100 days money saving challenge somewhere near the holiday season. Flipping your savings may help you keep up with it till the end. In the earlier months, your savings can range between $50 - $100 every day. As holidays get closer, you can save $10 - $40 every day. 

In simple words, you can tweak and flip the savings amount from higher to lower or vice versa depending on your expenses. Remember the ultimate goal of this challenge is to save SOME amount of money.

# Let’s Make It Fun! 

We told you this money saving challenge comes with interesting twists. Daily and weekly challenges will help you pave the way through unhealthy spending habits and discover new ways to save extra dollars. Let’s hop right onto them!

# Daily Challenges 

Choose at least 2-3 from these every day. 

**1. No Spend Day:** Choose a few days in a week when you pick free activities and stuff over spending your dollars on something you can absolutely live without. 

**2. Meal Prep:** Prepare a meal plan and spend the day savoring home-cooked food so you don’t have to eat out. Pack your lunch for workdays and cook your own delicious dinner. This can be done on most days of the week. You can reward yourself on the weekend with a [budget-friendly meal](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/cheap-summer-meals/) at your favorite place. 

**3. Make Your Own Coffee/Tea:** Instead of spending on coffee/tea at a cafe down the street, make one for yourself at home. There’s certainly no harm in making this a regular practice. 

**4. Pick Free Entertainment:** Look for free or low-cost entertainment around you - library events, free concerts, movie nights in local parks, etc instead of spending on subscriptions, expensive parties or movies. 

**5. Discount Hunt:** You cannot completely slash shopping off from your lifestyle. But when you have to shop, make sure you look for great discounts. Look for ways to get maximum discounts on groceries, clothes, and more. Plan your next shopping spree according to upcoming sales. 

**6. Unsubscribe:** When trying to [save money](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/save-money-live-better/) you need to beware of several money parasites that are often missed out. Subscriptions are few of those. Get rid of unnecessary subscriptions to save a significant amount from your monthly income. Keep a check on auto-paid subscriptions to cut-off unnecessary expenses. 

**7. Declutter:** Perfect for cleaning up your surroundings and making money out of it. Reassess your belongings and sell the ones you no longer need. Transfer the money to your savings. Do this one in a while to boost your savings and declutter your space. 

**8. Walking/Cycling Day:** Ditch your vehicle on a few days to choose walking or cycling for shorter distances. You can also opt for cheaper public transport to [save money on gas](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-save-money-on-gas/). This is yet another lifestyle change that can help you save significantly. 

**9. Carry Your Own Bottle:** Instead of spending on bottled water, start carrying your own reusable water bottle. Good to make it a habit!

# Weekly Challenges 

Choose 1 from these every week. 

**1. Pantry Picked:** This one’s a part of the daily meal prep challenge. Assess what’s already available in your pantry and plan the entire week’s meal with only those supplies. This helps save on groceries, ensuring no wastage of food. 

**2. No Impulse Buy:** Avoid any impulse purchases for an entire week. You can do this every week honestly. Whenever you’re tempted to buy something unnecessary, wait for at least 24 hours and understand if you really need that stuff or you can go on without it. Mostly the urge subsides. If it’s something important, you can look for cheaper alternatives later. 

**3. Double Down:** Got windfalls or raises? Count them as your savings. Or maybe you can double the amount of your daily or weekly savings to boost your overall progress. 

**4. Entertainment at Home:** Plan your entertainment at home for the week. Instead of going for drinks, clubbing, or movies, plan game nights, movie marathons, craft meet-ups at home with your beloved ones.

# Make It Till The End

Saving a few dollars everyday is definitely easier than showing up for workouts every morning. We want you to finish off this challenge with your desired savings. While you may be determined as well, here are a few tips to make sure you keep going. 

**(1) Know Your Goal:**  Having an end goal in mind before you start saving, helps you stick to the challenge till the end. Remember how as a child, our parents promised us rewards for excellent academic performances? The excitement for that one reward kept us motivated to achieve the best possible grades. Let your aspirations be your motivation this time as well. It can be a downpayment, [paying off debt](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/paying-off-debts/), saving for a dream holiday, or preparing for your kids’ admission. 

**(2) Set Reminders:** Once you take up these 100 days money saving challenge, there should be no excuses. Setting reminders on your phone (daily or weekly) will ensure that your money saving goals always stay in the back of your mind. This makes meeting daily savings goals easier. 

**(3) Reward Yourself:**  While completing the saving challenge would be your ultimate reward, little appreciation for yourself along the way will keep you going. You can choose a few reasonable weekly or bi-weekly rewards for yourself (your favorite treats, hangout with friends, etc). 

**(4) Do It With A Friend:** Taking up this [money saving challenge](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/52-week-money-challenge-5000/) with a friend or family member will keep your spirits high. Start together and track whether you’re both making enough progress on the saving journey. Share this challenge on your Pinterest board now!

# Go Easy On Yourself Yet Stay Focused 

If you keep waiting on the perfect time to start saving, it may probably never arrive. It’s better to start now with whatever income you have. Start small, but make sure to save at least something. 

For the ones who think they can build lump sum savings overnight - set realistic goals based on your income and expenses and follow a plan consistently. 

We hope these 100 days money saving challenge helps you meet your savings goals or at least start your savings journey. Stay motivated and focused to improve your financial well-being!

I don't know why Gaode Map is unwilling to make an English version. They are part of Alibaba and it is easy for them to do this.

But anyway, I made one. Although the functions are very basic at present, at least you can search for places and get routes. The data source is also Gaode Map, but we adapted it for English.

The app is not available on Google Play yet, you can download it here first: [https://cehnmnig.wixsite.com/china-wayfinder](https://cehnmnig.wixsite.com/china-wayfinder) (I know this landing page is too simple, I will make a better one then)

The features are basic but practical—no fees, no ads. Any feedback is welcomed!

Starting in San Pedro Sula, I rode through the lush landscapes of Honduras, passing through vibrant towns and scenic routes. The journey took me through La Ceiba, where I enjoyed the stunning views of Pico Bonito National Park, and Trujillo, a town rich in history and culture.
Crossing the border into Nicaragua was an adventure in itself, with the bustling border town of Las Manos marking the transition. Once in Nicaragua, the ride continued through the mountainous roads towards Matagalpa, a region known for its beautiful cloud forests and coffee plantations. The winding roads and breathtaking scenery made every mile an unforgettable experience.
This trip was not just about the ride; it was about the people I met along the way, the cultures I experienced, and the sense of freedom that comes with exploring new places on two wheels. From the Caribbean coast to the heart of Central America, this journey was a testament to the spirit of adventure and the joy of motorcycle travel. 🏍️🌍",1,1732519480.0,braapking,0,1.0,False

I know that height doesn't actually matter to most women as much as some men seem to fear that it does. Still, I know that some ladies do find tall guys attractive 

What I am curious about is: why that is. In other words, what about a taller man is attractive to you? 

Of course, different people will inevitably have different preferences and perspectives. That's why I'm asking here - I'm interested to hear about some of those differences!

We’ve had a few conversations while I wait at the traffic light, and now when he sees my car in the turning lane (I pass by on my way to work), he always gives me a big smile and wave. If we have time, he’ll ask how I’m doing and offer some positive words about why today is going to be a good day, or just say, “Have a wonderful day, sweetheart.” He’s never once asked for anything, just seems happy to be seen and acknowledged. I’ve brought him coffee a couple of times, and he’s always so grateful—sometimes even tears up. I’m just wondering if anyone else knows him or has similar stories to share.

# What is ""Alex Social – Conversation Casanova""?

Let’s talk about *Alex Social – Conversation Casanova*. It’s more than just a course; it’s a masterclass in understanding women and how to connect with them emotionally and conversationally. Created by Alex Social, a coach with **16 years of real-world experience**, it promises to transform any guy—from the shyest introvert to the socially awkward—into a man who can effortlessly attract women. The heart of the program is the *Conversational Compass*, a tool designed to help men navigate emotional dynamics and spark genuine attraction.

# Who is Alex Social?

Before you even ask, “Why should I trust this guy?” let’s break it down. Alex Social isn’t just another “dating guru” with a YouTube channel. He’s been in the trenches—coaching men across **45 countries** and leading over **6,270 live programs**. From bars and clubs to coffee shops and street fairs, Alex has honed his methods in real-time situations. His experience gives him unparalleled insight into what works—and what doesn’t—when it comes to connecting with women.

# Why Do Men Need This Course?

Dating today isn’t what it used to be. Between **post-pandemic social awkwardness**, fake profiles on dating apps, and the complexities introduced by modern movements, meeting and keeping high-value women has become a challenge for many. If you’ve struggled with rejection, the friend zone, or just flat-out running out of things to say, *Alex Social – Conversation Casanova* claims to be the game-changer you need. The course tackles the root causes of these struggles and offers a practical, transformative solution.

# Where Does It Work?

The magic of the *Conversational Compass* isn’t limited to the dating world. Whether you’re networking in the office, closing deals, or making new friends, these principles are designed to boost your overall charisma. Of course, its main selling point is in romantic situations—helping you become the guy women can’t help but notice, whether you’re at a bar, on a date, or even just grabbing coffee.

# When Will You See Results?

According to Alex, the transformation can happen **quickly**, depending on your commitment. The *Conversational Compass* doesn’t claim to be an instant fix, but it offers tools to make immediate improvements. With consistent application, you’ll notice changes in how people respond to you—and, most importantly, how women interact with you.

# How Does It Work?

The *Conversational Compass* teaches you how to activate a woman’s **full range of emotions**—from fun and lighthearted to deep and vulnerable—without being awkward or overbearing. It’s about striking a balance: too much humor, and you’re the class clown; too much intensity, and you risk turning her off. By mastering these subtleties, you’ll develop the *Conversational Charisma* that keeps women hooked.

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?

So, is *Alex Social – Conversation Casanova* legit? If you’re tired of guessing what works and want a structured, proven approach, it’s worth checking out. With Alex’s experience and the depth of this program, it feels like a step beyond cookie-cutter advice. The course isn’t just about picking up women; it’s about transforming yourself into someone who naturally attracts them—and that’s a skill that could change your life in more ways than one.",1,1732518980.0,NoraStudying,1,1.0,False

After a lot of thinking, we decided on a [honeymoon safari](https://www.easytravel.co.tz/tanzania-safari-tours/honeymoon-safari/)

 in Tanzania—and let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions we’ve ever made! 

I want to share our journey with you, as it truly was an unforgettable experience.

# Why We Chose Tanzania for Our Honeymoon

Before we even started planning, we knew we wanted something unique. We didn’t just want a beach holiday—we wanted an adventure that would bring us closer to nature and allow us to experience something extraordinary. After hearing about the incredible safaris in Tanzania and seeing photos of the stunning landscapes, we were sold.

Tanzania is a country that offers so much more than just a safari. From the Serengeti’s vast plains filled with wildlife to the beautiful beaches of Zanzibar, it had everything we wanted for the perfect honeymoon. Plus, the combination of exciting safaris and relaxing beach time seemed like the perfect balance.

# Our Safari Experience in the Serengeti

The first part of our honeymoon took us to the Serengeti National Park, and it truly felt like stepping into another world. We arrived at a luxury tented camp in the heart of the park, and from the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The tents were incredibly spacious, beautifully designed, and offered a comfortable experience in the wild. We even had a private balcony overlooking the savannah—perfect for sunrise coffee.

Our safari guides were so knowledgeable and passionate about the animals and their behavior. We saw lions lounging in the sun, cheetahs sprinting across the plains, and elephants walking majestically through the tall grass. But the most memorable moment was watching a lioness stalk her prey, a scene that played out right in front of our eyes. I don’t think I’ve ever been so captivated by nature.

One of the best things about the Serengeti is the vastness of it all. The endless landscape makes you feel like you're the only people in the world, and there’s something incredibly romantic about that. We spent the days exploring, and at night, we’d return to the camp to enjoy a delicious dinner under the stars. The staff even arranged a candlelit dinner for us one evening—just the two of us, surrounded by the sounds of the wild.

# A Magical Sunrise Hot Air Balloon Ride

One of the highlights of our honeymoon was a hot air balloon ride over the Serengeti. We woke up early, just before dawn, and were taken to the launch site where we watched the balloon inflate as the sun began to rise. Floating over the savannah, we saw zebras, giraffes, and gazelles from above, all bathed in the soft glow of the early morning light. It was magical. We couldn’t stop smiling the entire time, and it was a perfect way to start our day.

After landing, we enjoyed a champagne breakfast in the middle of the Serengeti, surrounded by wildlife. It felt like something out of a movie, and we both agreed it was an experience we’d never forget.

# The Ngorongoro Crater – A Romance in the Wild

Next, we headed to the Ngorongoro Crater. Known as the “Eighth Wonder of the World,” the crater is a breathtaking natural wonder, and we were excited to explore it together. The views were incredible, with the crater floor stretching out below us like a giant bowl filled with wildlife. It was a peaceful escape from the vastness of the Serengeti, and we could feel the romance in the air.

We spent the day in a private safari vehicle, spotting rhinos, buffaloes, and even lions lounging in the lush grass. It felt so intimate, just the two of us in the middle of nature’s greatest show. That evening, we stayed at a lodge with sweeping views of the crater, and as the sun set, we felt truly connected—not just to each other, but to the earth around us.

# Zanzibar – The Perfect Beach End to Our Honeymoon

After our safari adventures, we were ready to unwind, and Zanzibar was the perfect place to do that. The island is a paradise, with its white sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and warm, welcoming people. We stayed in a luxury beachfront resort where we spent our days snorkeling, lounging by the pool, and enjoying the peaceful sound of the waves.

One of the most romantic moments of our trip was a sunset dhow cruise. The boat glided along the coast as the sky turned shades of orange and pink, and we watched the sun dip below the horizon. It was a serene way to end our safari adventure and start the next chapter of our journey together.

# Why I Recommend a Honeymoon Safari in Tanzania

Looking back, I can confidently say that our honeymoon safari in Tanzania was the most amazing experience of our lives. It was the perfect blend of adventure, romance, and relaxation. We had the thrill of seeing wildlife in their natural habitat, the peace of the Ngorongoro Crater, and the beauty of Zanzibar’s beaches—all wrapped up in one unforgettable journey.

What made it so special was the way Tanzania’s landscapes and wildlife brought us closer. Whether it was sharing a quiet moment in the middle of the Serengeti or holding hands while watching the sunset in Zanzibar, every part of the trip felt like it was designed for us.

If you’re looking for a honeymoon that combines adventure, luxury, and unforgettable memories, I highly recommend a safari in Tanzania. From the heart-pounding excitement of spotting the Big Five to the tranquility of a beach sunset, it’s an experience that you and your partner will cherish forever.

1gzd3yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1gzd3yj/contemprary_romance/,Contemprary Romance ,"I'm looking for the title of a book I read once back in 2022. It was lent to me so I don't have it anymore and i can't remember the name for the life of me.

Things I know about it:

- Female protagonist
- Best friend (M) is in love with protag, protag doesn't reciprocate
- protag's love interest (M) works on his father's farm with his mother and at least one sister
- protag's love interest ends up building a house for them to live in at the end
- there's a wedding at some point 
- there's a physical altercation at the wedding
- protag works in a coffee shop

Things I remember but might have some details wrong about:

- protag ends up getting really sick or something at one point?
- there's a coworker at the coffee shop whose mother(or grandmother?) has health/financial issues
- there's a scene when protag and love interest are going through a rocky period where love interest's dad gives him advice while they ride horses

Things that could've been part of the book or I could be making them up I'm not quite sure:

- I think I remember love interest driving a white pickup truck?
- one of the scenes had something to do with a bathtub
- protag and best friend have a falling out
- protag and love interest keep thinking the other one hates them even though they very obviously like each other

1gzd3v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gzd3v9/bambino_pull_2_single_shot/,[Bambino] Pull 2 Single Shot ,"Hello, I recently got a Breville Bambino. Here in Italy, a single espresso typically uses about 8g of coffee, and I’m accustomed to that taste and shot length. However, I’ve read that pulling a proper single shot on this machine can be quite challenging. As a workaround, I’ve been pulling double shots and stopping the machine at my desired length, but this feels wasteful.

Additionally, when I want to prepare two coffees simultaneously to share with someone, I run into an issue: the flow from the spout is uneven, making it impractical to use two cups at the same time. What would be the most effective solution to address these problems? Thank you!",1,1732518213.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

>So, my stepdad and I are pretty much complete opposites, and I'm really struggling to come up with gift ideas for him this year. He's a pretty average middle aged Texan dude, zero hobbies outside of watching TV and eating out. I can't to get him a gift card to a restaurant because my family said no cash or gift cards this year. He doesn't like clothes and already has enough t-shirts and denim shorts to last a lifetime. I'm completely stumped. Feel free to ask questions about him to try to come up with something he would love that won't break the bank for me.

* Something simple like air hockey or a mini putting green for indoor fun during downtime.

# 14. Chili Starter Kit

* Everything he needs to make authentic Texas chili, beautifully packaged.

# 15. Engraved Keychain or Wallet Insert

* Something small but heartfelt, like a keychain with ""Best Stepdad"" or a wallet insert with a short, meaningful note.

About 4 months ago I spilled coffee on it (Sacrilege, I know)

I fully stripped it, and cleaned the electronics appropriately. I lubricated the switches and contacts as well.  
After reassembling it, It's been running perfectly ever since.

Over the last 2 weeks I've been having issues with the scroll wheel malfunctioning. When scrolling up or down, it skips scrolls, and scrolls the opposite way to the input on the wheel.

I assumed it was because of the coffee spill, but I also saw a lot of complaints online of people having the same issue, and it seems like it could be a production issue with the mouse. So I opened the mouse again, and opened the Rotary encoder, flushed it out with very light air pressure to avoid damaging the insides, and lubricated it with contact spray for electronics. After reassembling it, it worked fine for a bit and now the issue has returned.  


I want to replace the rotary encoder, but I'm not sure if that's the issue, or if it's from the coffee spill.

What kind of encoder should I be replacing it with ?  
I have a lot of experience with soldering electronics, so I'm not worried about that, I just have no idea if replacing the encoder will fix it, or what encoder I should replace it with to avoid the same issue in the future.

I no longer have the budget to replace the mouse with something of similar quality, so I'd really love to fix it",0,1732517956.0,MouseReview,0,0.5,False

I have been working for this company for three years, I have always thought na as long as I did my best with good performance ratings, as long as I am compliant, and as long as I take certifications frequently makakaangat din ako sa corporate ladder. Nakaka frustrate lang para saakin lalo na kasi sa 3 years ko sa company junior lang ang kaya nilang i abot. I started as a bootcamp (during this time akala ko junior level itong position na ito) i did my best maganda performance ko sa mga trainings, plus i take japanese classes sa company kahit lagpas na sa oras ng shift ko para mas ma upskill ako. Nung napunta ako sa project may times ako nag cocontact sa japanese side or nag tratranslate ako para sa ibang tao. I was surprised nung pinalakad ko sa manager ko yung promotion na ang position pala is JUNIOR lang?! Tapos na delay pa siya ng 6 months kasi “SABI NG HR MARAMING BACKLOGS SA PROMOTION KAYA NAKA QUEUE PARIN TALENT PROFILE”. Tapos itong HR pa ang lakas makapapel sa office akala mo ang daming ginagawa stress na lahat kasi delayed and promotion tapos ang gagawin lang nila is magbibigay ng isang pirasong donut, at bottled na coffee? And malala pa niyan marami na ngang backlogs sa promotion kuha pa sila ng kuha ng mga employee kahit wala masyadong projects. Tapos kung may projects man hindi nila ioffer sa mga naka bench ang kukunin rin lang nila is yung may mga current project or kakatapos ng current project. Imagine napaka underpaid tapos overworked mo. Tapos ang lala pa so nag send sila ng survey regarding sa work from home. Maraming pumili ng 4 days lang per month and RTO tapos binasura lang nila yung survey tapos nag decide na gawing 3 days per week ang RTO as per my friends? That time sinasabi nila samin nasa project kami kaya di kami inrerequire mag RTO pero how long will it take para biglaan na lang kami pilitin? So i resigned and sent my resignation letter and wow after that todo ang pangigipit nila, need daw nila malaman ginagawa ko every hour. Halos wala ka talaga mapagkakatiwalaan sa company na to, unless sa mabibilang sa isang kamay na mga managers. Which brings me back to the question na dapat bang mag suffer ang mga employees sa kabobohan ng HR?

I'm talking we had the same interests on things, same views about life, and same music taste and everything. I remember scrolling down her playlist and pointing out nearly every song that we shared. She was perfect in every sense of the word, she ticked every box for me and some I didn't know existed till then. 

We went on dates every week, usually 2-3 times, went to prom together and I think that was the best night of my life. I still think about it all the time. I remember when we destroyed the dance floor, when she got a headache and I had to go comfort her, when everyone I knew danced together and partied. I even was dumb enough to give her my lavender flower tie that has her lipstick on it as a souvenir.It was all going great till a month in when she told me she was moving away early for college.

I already knew about it cause a friend has told me so I wasn't to bothered by it but I told her that I'd be there for her regardless. Now, the college she was going to was about 12 hours away and I knew visiting was going to be hard. But I promised I'd make it work and she said she would too. But we had a month and a half till then so we didn't worry about it. 

With so little time, we went on as many dates as we could. Grabbing food, eating froyo, just driving around, going to the park, etc. Just normal couple stuff. Then, her graduation party came and it went well till the end. We had our first argument (I can't remember what because this happened 6 months ago) and it shook us up that we were probably not going to see each for a while.

Infact, the final time I saw her, and our last date, didn't go as well as I hoped. It went good, we talked, hugged, kissed, and said our I love yous but something felt off to me then. I just ignored it and kept on pushing through.

My last gift to her was a care package, a basket of her favorite snacks, energy drinks, and coffee to keep her over till she got to her new house (her parents moved with her and she was staying at their house till the dorms opened for the early summer semester.) She loves it so much she sent a letter about it, more about that later.

Anyway, we talked every day. I ruined my sleep schedule for Katie just so I could keep talking to her. It was about two weeks in I noticed her mood had drastically changed. She seemed less energetic about talking with me and it made me really sad. I tried cheering her up but I could tell it was getting to her like it was me. I was feeling lonely because she was so far away but I couped by talking to her outside. I did that because I knew she was under the same night sky I was and it helped me understand it wasn't permanent.

Unfortunately, she didn't see it that way and she broke up with me. She said it wasn't my fault and she just wanted the physically aspect of our relationship. I didn't take offense to that at the time because I didn't value that part compared to other but sure. I tried to convince her that it wasn't great but it'll get better. I wanted to tell her that I was planning to visit her sometime in the next week but something about the way she said it killed me. I didn't fight it and maybe that's something I regret not doing now.

Then a day later, the letter arrived. It basically said thank you for the care package and she loved and missed me a lot. That actually destroyed me. For the first time in my life, I lost my cool. I called her and asked what the hell was wrong with her not telling me about this and she had a lot of nerve. She apologized and looking back I probably did the wrong thing. It honestly hurt me more when our streaks died.

I tried talking to her again, months later obviously, because I didn't want to lose her as a friend and we both talked about how that's what we would want if we ever did break up. 

It didn't end well 

I don't know exactly what happened, we were talking about working out and how the freshman 15 was our nightmares when she just unfriended me. Just like that. 

I get updates from my friend about her sometimes, against my will btw. Apparently she's not doing good? He says she seems depressed and is always drunk and isn't doing good in school. Thats not the person I knew, I think she's going through stuff and needs someone to help her out.

It won't be me. I'm still in so much damn pain. It's getting to the point where I'm actually dreaming about her. I could not be making this shit up. The first time I thought it was a fluke. In that dream, she came back to where we lived and asked to start dating again and I said yes (or more accurately my subconscious said yes) The second one was waay more personal. We were at a carnival, passing by toy, candy, make up, and clothes stores (probably combining a memory from when we went to the mall and filmed a tiktok with our county fair date) and we were being physically pulled by something to the Ferris wheel. We both hated Ferris wheels. But what was strange was she got on but I didn't, I watched her have fun/be terrified from the ground. And when she got off, she walked right pass me. I tried getting her attention but then my dream vision warped and I woke up in a cold sweat. That was last night and I'm afraid to go to bed.

I need to know how you all get over someone? Especially when you thought she was the one? I am in so much agony and I can't talk to me friends or family about it because they all think I moved on. 

I also want to contact and get back to her but I know that's just my stupid monkey brain and it's a dumb idea.

1gzcv6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperpigmentation/comments/1gzcv6z/i_spent_3000_on_failed_hyperpigmentation/, I spent $3000+ on failed hyperpigmentation treatments before finding what actually works. Here's what I learnt 🔍,"Ever had that moment when you look in the mirror and barely recognize yourself because of dark patches that seemed to appear overnight? That was me 2 years ago. After wasting thousands on treatments that didn't work, I went full detective mode and analyzed hundreds of pigmentation success stories across Reddit. What I found literally changed my life - and my face.

**The ""Holy Sh\*t"" Stats:**

\- 78% of people tried at least 3 expensive treatments before finding what worked

\- Average spend before finding a solution: $2,400

\- Most common regret: ""I wish someone had told me this sooner""

\- Success rate with consistent routines: 89%

\- Most shocking success: Someone's 7-year melasma disappeared in 4 months 🤯



**The Most Desperate Questions I Found:**

1. ""Will I ever feel confident without makeup again?""

2. ""Why do some dark spots fade while others get worse?""

3. ""Am I stuck with this forever?""

4. ""Why isn't anything working for me?""

5. ""Is it worth trying one more treatment?""



**The REAL Tea on What Actually Works:**

The ""Worth Every Penny"" Ingredients:

\- Tranexamic Acid (the dark horse nobody talks about enough)

\- Alpha Arbutin (but not all forms are created equal)

\- Kojic Acid (when you know how to use it right)

\- Vitamin C (but there's a catch - more on this below)

\- Azelaic Acid (the unsung hero for stubborn spots)



**The ""Game-Changing"" Discoveries:**

\- The sunscreen hack that changed everything (hint: it's not just about SPF)

\- Why some people's pigmentation got worse with vitamin C

\- The weird connection between gut health and melasma

\- The $3 kitchen ingredient that outperformed $200 creams

\- Why your face routine might be making things worse



**The Timeline Nobody Tells You About:**

\- Week 1-2: Nothing (seriously, patience)

\- Week 3-4: Slight improvement (don't get too excited yet)

\- Month 2: The ""Is this working or am I crazy?"" phase

\- Month 3: The ""Holy crap, my skin!"" moment

\- Month 6+: The ""I can't believe this is my face"" results



**Mind-Blowing Patterns I Found:**

**1. The ""Less is More"" Phenomenon**

   \- People who used fewer products had better results (RIP my wallet)

   \- Simple routines = 72% success rate

   \- Complex routines = 41% success rate



**2. The Surprising Triggers**

   \- That healthy smoothie that might be making things worse

   \- Why your morning coffee routine needs a tweak

   \- The workout timing that could be affecting your skin



**The ""I Wish I Knew This Sooner"" List:**

\- Why layering products in the wrong order can make pigmentation worse

\- The real reason some spots come back even after they fade

\- Why that expensive treatment you're considering might make things worse

\- The truth about natural remedies (some actually work!)

2. milk! i drink milk daily with my coffee, and i’ve heard that milk makes ur face fatter and puffy, i substitute it with oat milk, but a lot of people say that oat milk has carbs and it basically makes you fat too.

is there any truth to this? is oat milk better than milk in terms of face fat? do you have any idea on how to lose face fat?",1,1732516986.0,diet,1,1.0,False

We have a one year old and I am 9 weeks pregnant, and I am a stay at home mom. Yesterday was my birthday and we had a small fight after the clock hit midnight, which resulted in him walking away from me and calling me psycho and a bitch (we concluded today the fight was just a misunderstanding- i was joking and he was being serious about a problem but i didn’t realize). I was upset, crying, and went to bed. He was so mad that I didn’t come talk to him about it before i fell asleep. 

The next morning was my birthday and he told me to get ready to get coffee. I cried again because of how upset I still was because the name calling is an ongoing problem. I told him to get coffee and i’ll go later with our baby and he waited around for an hour until I went with him. This later became a problem because he says I ignored him all morning and gave him the silent treatment. In the car he started the conversation about last time asking why I went to bed on him. Long story short, i didn’t argue much with him and rather stayed quiet because i found it bizarre he was making it a big deal. He then went on to tell me things that really hurt me: stonewalling was as bad as cheating so to not to be mad if that’s what happens in the future (he has a past of cheating), why he hasn’t and will never marry me, how we’re just coparenting and he doesn’t even see me as a girlfriend, how I was ruining *his* day to spend my birthday with me?? didn’t make sense to me but i told him i didn’t want to spend the day with him anymore and spent the day with my sister. he has ruined a lot of holidays, and im not sure it’s a coincidence or not but it’s getting really sad. 

of course, i was punished for not spending the day with him and didn’t talk to him much that night either. i brought him home dessert and didn’t get anything from him. not even a hug on my birthday or a kiss on the cheek at least. i have always gone way out on his birthday, throwing him surprise parties or surprising him with handmade gifts and decorating before he gets home. is this weird? has anyone else experienced this? 

sorry this is getting long, nonetheless he says he did absolutely nothing wrong. anytime he calls me a bitch or any name that upsets me he says it’s true, that i *was* being a bitch. i continue to tell him over and over how it’s wrong to say such awful things about our relationship and cheating, but he doesn’t disagree or apologize or take it back ever. he stands on it and says it again bc he knows it hurts me. AM I OVERREACTING?! he says i ruined my birthday for him because he had so much planned and i was evil for leaving him at home. 

when we got home after that conversation, i told him i was done and leaving the next morning. we have been technically homeless for a year straight now and living with his parents. he has kicked me out with our baby, twice, and i lived with my parents for less than a month. i would go live with my parents (who i don’t have the greatest relationship with because of my boyfriend) or a woman’s shelter. i am a stay at home mom and make maybe 1k a month from home, so i dont really know how i will do it on my own, but i feel emotionally drained and need to get out. he will never ever change and i know that now. what happened on my birthday was a big slap in the face. i don’t even care about my birthday really, but watching my boyfriend not care or say he didn’t do anything wrong is so bizarre to me. watching me cry on my own birthday and not caring again is weird to me. 

after i told him i was going to leave in the morning, and stopped talking to him he came up and said to me “but im the bad guy if i cheat on you? i’d have every right to cheat on you in this situation.” 

what would you do in this situation? i do love him and our baby adores him and doesn’t do well away from him. i would love to stay with him and make things work but this is an ongoing pattern and how every fight goes. if anyone understands him please help me. any tips on how to deal with him to work things out? or should i really just leave? am i overreacting or is this a true problem? is there a better action plan? btw we started therapy a month ago but he won’t go anymore.

1gzcf96,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMetro/comments/1gzcf96/tap_should_be_spun_off_into_an_independent_llc/,TAP should be spun off into an independent LLC,"There is much more potential for TAP but it's limitations are that it's just another department within Metro that has to go through bureaucracy to get stuff done. 

If TAP were given more autonomy to make deals and decisions on their own, things would go much faster. 

Case in point, Discover Card was originally a financial dept for Sears. Discover saw that being under the wing of Sears only hindered their operations when they could be making better opportunities like expanding Discover Card use outside of Sears and promoting its existence by coming up with promotions like discounts on Six Flags amusement park tickets for cardholders, etc. Eventually Discover won its independence from Sears and look where it is today, Sears is defunct but Discover survived. 

The opportunity that TAP can do is similar. It's hinderance is being tied to just being transit cash for Metro. It cannot expand beyond LA County transit payments when the opportunities to become a SoCal regional payments system is blocked by bureaucracy. It doesn't have the independence to say let's see if OCTA would like to adopt TAP and we'll provide all the expertise. Or it can't say let's allow stored value to pay for an In 'N Out burger or a Starbucks coffee. It can't even venture out to become a transit centric banking system like offer interest or a frequent use points rewards system. All things that the rest of the world is capable of doing but not us. All because of bureaucracy of it being under Metro. 

TAP should be spun off as its own LLC. Things would go much more faster and smoother if it can make its own financial decisions with its own internal Board than wait once a month for Metro Board to adopt things and only if it comes up on the agenda. 

edit (since it's coming up): Open loop payments have a flaw. It cannot provide discounted fares like child, student, senior or disabled concessionary rates. Your VISA or MC debit or credit card has no way of knowing that the cardholder is a child, an enrolled student, a senior or a person with disability. How would you get around this. 

edit #2: When people cite ""other cities"" please bear in mind that you tend to overlook the best transit cities in the world in Asia like Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, HK and Singapore which have far more ridership and use than any city in the US, Canada or Europe. This seems to be a recurring close mindedness that plagues most transit subreddits as if Asia doesn't exist. When you say ""the world"" bear in mind the ""world"" isn't just centered upon the US, Canada or Europe and that half of the world lives in Asia which has their own excellent mass transit systems as well.

This is a rental so there’s only so much I can do. I have a 3 year old and 7 month old so one of my first tasks is getting a large rug and baby proofing the space. Our current couch is obviously much too large and designed for a corner.

1)Do I choose a new couch first or rug?

2) Suggestions on patterns/colors for rug or couch? I find myself drawn to dark green colors and floral patterns but am afraid this will make the already small space appear smaller and more cluttered (with two young children there is always some clutter somewhere).

3)Suggestions on what to do for focal point? Our only option for a fireplace is electric and I’m not sure if I want a media console with a fireplace or a fireplace with mantle. I think I would still sadly need to put the tv above the mantle given the layout of the space.

4)Window treatments? Would any rendition of curtains not make the space look too cluttered or should we just go with white blinds?
