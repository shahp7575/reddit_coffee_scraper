1qlhd0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_B_eating_you/comments/1qlhd0v/the_misadventures_of_bailey/,The Misadventures of Bailey,"Chapter One A Night to Remember Bailey was known to his friends as a ""peace-loving guy,” but life had other plans for him. One Saturday night, he found himself embroiled in a mix-up that would go down in the annals of his friend group as ""The Great Incident.""  (The Setup) It all started at his favorite pub, “The Tipsy Tortilla.” Bailey had just downed his second taco, declaring them the finest in the city, when he decided to step outside for some fresh air. He hadn’t even finished chewing when he heard a commotion—a few blocks down, a gathering of yelling bystanders had caught his curious eyes.“Maybe they need a hero,” he thought, desperately searching for a chance to gain some minor street cred. He realized, however, that he had left his hero cape back in the laundry. (The Unfortunate Turn) Against all sense of discretion, Bailey strolled over, only to discover it was just a small street fight between two guys arguing over a disputed last slice of pizza. At that moment, Bailey felt a surge of righteous indignation swell within him. ""I can't stand by!"" he shouted, and ran forward, only to trip over an uneven sidewalk slab, face-planting directly into the fray. The crowd gasped, and with fish-out-of-water grace, Bailey catapulted himself into the main event—a theater of chaos featuring wild punches and pizza flying in all directions. His first instinct was to break it up, which, in retrospect, wasn’t the best idea. The two combatants paused mid-brawl, stared bemusedly at Bailey, and then, in a unanimous decision that Bailey would never quite understand, decided he was an enemy too. (The Aftermath) Before he knew it, Bailey was awash in fists, literally. He took one to the left cheek and one to the right, and it swiftly knocked the sense out of him. It was at this moment he learned a vital lesson: “When trying to be a hero, please ensure you can at least stand upright.” As he lay on the ground, dazed and confused, the onlookers finally began to remember their phones. Suddenly, they switched from cheering him on to filming the spectacle. And in the midst of this unfortunate event, two opportunistic thieves seized the chance. While Bailey was busy contemplating his life choices on the pavement, they jacked his phone and wallet and made off as if they were ninjas. (The Arrival of Authorities) Just when he thought his evening couldn't get worse, who should arrive on the scene but the local police? He looked up, bloodied, bruised, and wallet-less, trying to wave them down. Instead of being the valiant knight who saved the day, Bailey soon found himself in handcuffs.“Wait! I’m the victim!” he protested, raising his voice in an attempt to clarify the scenario. Instead, he ended up sounding like a cartoon character caught in a rising tidal wave of trouble. In a matter of minutes, he was seated in the back of a police car, getting the kind of metal bed rest that his mom always warned him about. (Chapter Two Into the Clink). Upon arrival at the precinct, Bailey was escorted in, his reputation as a well-meaning chap fading faster than his chances of getting a late-night taco. “You don’t understand! I was just trying to help!” he retorted to a sergeant who was only half-listening. The officers, having doubtlessly seen their fair share of misguided vigilantes, were generally unfazed. The Irony Bailey, now sitting in a cell with a bunch of tough characters, started to realize his predicament wasn’t just hilarious—it was downright tragic… in a comedic way. His fellow cellmates exchanged glances as Bailey began to recount not only his ill-fated heroics but also just how he had lost everything while trying to keep the peace.For some strange reason, they found his story so amusing that they started laughing heartily. One of them, a man whose name was probably something like ""Grizz,"" said, “Ain’t that a twist? The hero ends up in jail!” The Redemption By morning, Bailey found himself sitting in a waiting area with a cup of remarkably terrible coffee and an officer who finally asked the right questions. After explaining how he had gotten tangled up in events, they decided to let him go—mostly because the officers had a 9 AM coffee run to catch, and clearly, Bailey posed no significant threat (except maybe to his own well-being).As he stepped outside, a strange sense of peace settled on him. Sure, he had been battered, robbed, and wrongly arrested, but in the end, he ended up with a story that would bond him with his friends for years to come. Though slightly bruised, Bailey walked away with a valuable lesson: sometimes, it’s best to let the pizza eaters settle their own scores—and maybe keep your hero cape washed and ready for another day. Epilogue: The Hero Nobody Asked For Later that evening, Bailey returned to “The Tipsy Tortilla,” and all his friends greeted him with a round of tacos and laughter. They toasted to his bravery and to the unintentional mastery of unintended consequences. And as Bailey bit into a taco—this time fully aware of the chaos surrounding him—he knew one thing for certain: life, like his dear tacos, was both spicy and unpredictable.Bailey may have tried to be a hero that night, but he learned to be a good friend instead, and that was worth so much more than a night on the street.

Asa na part sa student-teacher handbook na pwede ang intimate relationship between Teachers and Students? or is it even metioned in the handbook nga bawal na sha kay conflict of interest? From a Well-known University 

Naa ba lain nakapansin na kaning Student kay mas favored ni Teacher? Been seeing them around campus with a group of so-called ""friends"", pero alibi ra diay to sila to cover up something lurid na ila diay gina tolerate si Teacher and Student just to pass every sem with good grades. And who in their right minds would tolerate this kind of violation? Clearly, someone na involved pud sa inani na setups. 

Not to judge but this student is a shiftee and in my opinion dili jud ni siya achiever or ga do great in class. Miraculously, dako jud iyang scores and iyang letter grade itself sa ani na class last semester (which is si teacher/lover ang prof) even though this major subject is really kinda hard even for the achievers.



How is it normal to hangout everyday after classes kani si Teacher with this Student in a masquerade na it's a private tutoring sessions kuno when in reality, they are trying to conceal the fact na there is more misconduct in their relationship talaga? Naa ba student & teacher na mag uban sa coffee shops and laag na sila lang duha? Kuyaw pud. A clear violation sa School policy indeed. 



Isn't it the Teacher's responsibility to maintain professionalism towards their students? pero why man maka dare siya to be unethical just to be with this Student? 

Have you ever wondered how many student-teacher relationship are out there na gaka tolerate pud kay there are alot of people involved in such stories allowing them to pursue this normalized behaviour? A bunch of weirdos. And to think that their actions will be kept a secret forever? It will be interesting to see how this all plays out.

1qlhb6o,https://i.redd.it/31eaxnjs89fg1.png,Mafia Princess: I Swapped My Groom Who Planned IVF with,"

“We’re getting married in two weeks,” I said, my throat burning. “And you’ve already started having a child with another woman.” “We’re just doing IVF,” he snapped. “Don’t make this emotional—it’s a procedure, not an affair.” I stared at the emptiness he left behind and posted to my story: ""Thinking of switching out the groom. Any takers?""



Chapter 1

Two weeks before my wedding.

I was sitting cross-legged on the rug, surrounded by glossy gift bags and tissue paper, when my phone buzzed with yet another notification from the planner.

\> Final headcount? Confirm seating chart? Any special requests from the groom’s side?

Groom’s side.

I almost laughed.

If my father could see me right now—Lola Fulton, wearing my mother’s surname like a mask, playing the devoted fiancée in a New York apartment he’s never stepped foot in—he’d either drag me back to Los Angeles by my hair… or applaud the audacity.

The Genovese daughter turned Fulton.

The runaway bride.

I reached for the tape dispenser, trying to ignore the hollow feeling under my ribs, when the front door opened.

Joel walked in late, suit jacket unbuttoned, tie loosened, sleeves rolled to his forearms. He smelled like expensive cologne and cold air.

His eyes flicked over everything without really seeing it: the bowed gift boxes, the embossed thank-you cards, the carefully curated little life I’d built for us.

“Lola.”

I set the tape down, slow and deliberate. “You’re late.”

“I had things to handle.”

“Business?” I echoed. “What could possibly be more important than our wedding right now? You haven’t helped with anything lately—you’ve left it all to me.”

His jaw tightened. A tiny movement. A crack in otherwise perfect composure.

Most people wouldn’t notice it.

After nine years of chasing Joel Ramirez, I could read him in heartbeats.

He stepped farther into the living room but didn’t sit, didn’t loosen his watch, didn’t even take off his shoes. He stayed standing—poised, contained, like he’d only stopped here because he had to.

“I need you to listen,” Joel said. “It’s about Cannon.”

Cannon Ramirez.

The Mafia boss of the New York–based Ramirez Group.

Joel’s godfather.

The man who took him in after his parents died, who raised him, who turned him from a quiet boy into the kind of man people lowered their voices around.

My fingers tightened on the roll of ribbon.

“What about him?” I asked.

“He’s worried about Maya.”

Cannon’s only daughter. The princess of the Ramirez family. The woman who was practically raised at his side in the business.

“That makes sense,” I said. “She’s his only child.”

Joel finally turned fully to face me, expression set, like the decision had already been made and I was just being briefed.

“Cannon is gravely ill,” he said. “His greatest wish is for Maya to have someone to rely on in the future. If she doesn’t have a male heir, her uncles will seize everything. The company, the assets, the name. They’ll tear her apart.”

A faint chill slid through me. I kept my voice even.

“So what does that have to do with us?”

“I’m going to help her have a child,” he said. “It’s IVF.”

He said it like it was a charity donation.

I just stared.

He slipped a folder from inside his jacket and dropped it onto the coffee table. My eyes flicked down. Anonymized clinic letterhead. Appointment dates. Notes in neat, impersonal font.

“Cannon set it up months ago,” Joel went on, voice clipped, already impatient with my silence. “Private clinic. No paper trail. Maya’s done the screenings. The cycle’s underway.”

My throat tightened. “And your part?”

His gaze didn’t flinch. “I already gave the sample.”

The air left my lungs all at once.

He didn’t rush to fill the silence. He just watched me, waiting for me to accept it the way I had accepted every other line he’d drawn in the sand.

“The embryo transfer is scheduled for next week,” he added, like he was reading off his calendar. “After that, it’s out of my hands. It’s a procedure, Lola. It’s not an affair.”

It’s not an affair.

My ears rang. I waited for him to look away, to blink, to show even a hairline crack in that composed mask.

He didn’t.

“We’re getting married in two weeks,” I said, each word scraping its way out. “And you’ve already started having a baby with another woman.”

His eyes hardened—not with guilt, not with regret. Just irritation. Like I’d interrupted a meeting with something trivial.

“Don’t make it emotional,” he snapped.

I forced my voice not to shake. “What else am I supposed to make it, Joel? A wedding favor? A fun fact for our guests? ‘Welcome to our happily ever after, by the way, the first heir is already on pre-order with someone else’?”

“You’re overreacting,” he said flatly. “This isn’t about you. It’s about securing Cannon’s legacy and keeping Maya alive. Do you have any idea what her uncles will do if she’s left alone? They’ll push her out, marry her off, bleed everything Cannon built. I can stop that.”

There it was—the justification. The noble cause. The weighty family obligations that always seemed to matter just a fraction more than I did.

“Of course,” I said quietly. “Silly me. I forgot my feelings don’t rank as high as the Ramirez portfolio.”

His jaw clenched. “Don’t twist my words.”

“I don’t have to twist them,” I said. “You walked in here and told me, very calmly, that you’re making a baby with someone else before our wedding.”

“It’s not a relationship,” he insisted. “It’s a medical arrangement. There won’t be… anything between us. You’re my fiancée. That doesn’t change.”

Something in my chest gave a quiet, exhausted crack.

“What if I said I can’t accept that?” I asked. “That I won’t marry a man whose first child belongs to another woman?”

He stared at me for a long moment. When he finally spoke, his voice was smooth again. Cold and reasonable.

“Then you’d be asking me to let Maya burn,” he said. “And I’m not that man.”

Not I’m not that man to you.

Just not that man.

The difference slid between my ribs like a knife.

“So that’s it?” I asked. “My options are… smile and pretend this doesn’t matter, or accept that I’m the kind of woman who would let another girl be fed to wolves?”

“I’m doing this,” he said, final and calm. “End of discussion.”

He reached for his keys. The metal scraped across the marble.

“I have a meeting,” he added, already turning toward the door.

“A meeting,” I echoed. “Let me guess. With Maya?”

His gaze cut to me, sharp as broken glass. “Watch your mouth.”

Then he walked out.

The door slammed hard enough to rattle the picture frame above the console table. A penguin-shaped magnet fell off the fridge and clattered onto the floor.

Chapter 2

Silence spilled into every corner of the apartment.

I sat in the middle of the rug, surrounded by the evidence of a life I’d spent years stitching together—monogrammed candles, boxes of macarons, pale ribbon that matched the flowers I’d already ordered.

My throat tightened until I couldn’t swallow.

I didn’t cry.

Not yet.

Crying had always been a luxury in my world. You cried when there was someone there to catch you.

I’d learned early that I had to be my own net.

So I did the next best thing.

I picked up my phone.

Opened my Moments.

Typed with hands that barely trembled:

Wedding in two weeks. Thinking of swapping the groom. Any takers?

I hit post before I could talk myself out of it.

Within seconds, the comments rolled in.

LOL FINALLY, I’LL BE YOUR GROOM.

Swap him for a billionaire.

Girl, stop. You’re obsessed with that man.

Two weeks? I’ll wear a tux, no questions asked.

Teasing. Laughing emojis. A chorus of people who thought I was being dramatic on purpose.

Because everyone knew I loved Joel Ramirez.

They’d watched me chase him for nine years like he was the only star in my sky. I’d called it devotion. Persistence. Romance.

When he finally agreed to be my boyfriend, I walked around for a month like I’d won a war no one else could see.

When he proposed on my twenty-seventh birthday, I said yes so quickly I didn’t even let him finish the question. I’d bought his ring with five years of overtime and skipped meals, whispering to myself that we were building something permanent.

I’d believed my loyalty had earned me a guarantee.

But happy endings don’t start with your fiancé explaining, calmly, that the first child he wants will belong to someone else.

I stared at the comments and felt something cold settle into place inside me. Maybe my humility hadn’t looked like love to him.

Maybe it had looked like permission.

My phone buzzed again.

Not another comment.

A call.

The screen lit up with a number I hadn’t seen in years.

For a second, my heart forgot how to beat.

Damian Mancuso.

My former arranged fiancé.

The heir to the Mancuso family.

My childhood friend—the quiet boy other kids called untouchable while their parents whispered about his surname.

When I was still building sandcastles on the beach, Damian was already trailing behind his father, small hand in a bigger one, learning how to run the Mancuso empire.

Considering his family is one of the oldest and wealthiest old-money syndicates in Los Angeles, it sounded almost unbelievable.

Exposing a six-year-old to that world should’ve been unthinkable.

And yet Damian had absorbed it all with terrifying ease. By ten, he could handle simple dock accounts. Men three times his age had stared at him in stunned, uneasy silence.

He’d always been the standout among kids our age. Handsome, brilliant, quietly dangerous.

Every child grew up being compared to him.

No one wanted to play with the boy whose report cards and bloodline made their parents sigh.

No one except me.

Even back then, I’d been hopelessly shallow about pretty faces.

He turned me down more than ten times, but I still trailed after him like a shadow. Even when he didn’t talk to me or look at me, just being near him felt… right. I used to share my lollipops with him, even though he’d wrinkle his nose at the ones I’d already licked.

He always ate them anyway.

Then, when I was fifteen, the Mancuso family was hit with a crisis so big the newspapers called it “the quake.”

He left Los Angeles for Italy with his parents.

I stayed behind with Alfie, my father.

Little by little, Damian and I lost contact.

During my years in New York, I fell in love with Joel. And to escape the arranged marriage with Damian, I’d run—across the country, across my own history—hiding my last name, erasing every trace of the life I’d been born into.

Genovese became Fulton.

Princess became nobody.

I stared at Damian’s name on the screen until the call almost cut off.

Then I answered, my voice steady because I refused to give anyone the satisfaction of hearing it shake.

“Hello?”

There was a pause on the other end. A soft exhale.

Then Damian’s voice—lower than I remembered, smoother, with the weight of years in it.

“Is it true?”

My spine went rigid. “What?”

“Don’t play innocent, Lola.” His tone was mild, edged with something darker. “Swapping the groom.”

Heat rushed to my face, like the words themselves were a slap. Of course he’d already seen the post.

My fingers tightened around the phone. The apartment suddenly felt too small, the air too thick. I got to my feet without thinking and walked toward the balcony. The sheer curtain lifted as I opened the glass door, a cool breeze slipping past me and brushing the broad leaves of the bird-of-paradise plant.

I watched the city lights blur for a beat.

“It is,” I said finally.

Another pause. When he spoke again, his voice was calm. Decisive.

“Well then,” Damian said, “if you don’t mind… would you be willing to resume our former engagement?”

I went absolutely still.

My brain tried to reject the words.

My heart tried to lunge for them.

A way out.

A lifeline.

A man who knew exactly who I was—Lola Genovese—and wasn’t asking me to shrink to fit beside him.

I thought of Joel’s folder on the table. Of sterile clinic forms, clinical betrayal, his impatient, “Don’t make it emotional.”

I thought of nine years of chasing a man who treated my love like a given.

And then I thought of the boy who’d once taken every lollipop I’d offered, even when he pretended not to want them.

I didn’t let myself hesitate long enough to get scared.

“Alright,” I said, my voice quiet but sharp. “What’s your condition?”

Damian didn’t miss a beat. “I’ll send over a prenuptial agreement tomorrow.”

It figured. After I’d run from the wedding once, he was entitled to armor up.

“Anything else?” I asked.

There was a hint of movement on the line, like he’d leaned back, considering me from an ocean away.

“And one more thing,” he said. I could hear the faint curve of a smile in his voice now—dangerous, unfamiliar. “Lola.”

My pulse kicked.

“I’d like you to change my contact name,” he said softly, “to ‘Husband.’”

I stared at my phone like it had grown teeth.

This Damian felt different from the boy I remembered.

Less distant.

More… possessive.

“Damian—” I began, but he cut me off, his voice dropping to something almost intimate.

“Lola,” he said, “this is your first step toward a new life.”

Chapter 3

The line went dead, but Damian’s last words stayed, thrumming in my ear.

This is your first step toward a new life.

The apartment hummed quietly around me. The fridge. Distant traffic. My own heartbeat in my throat.

A new life.

With Damian.

I set the phone down on the counter, then picked it up again almost immediately.

I wasn’t stupid. I knew what I was doing.

I wasn’t running to him.

I was running through him. He was a door, and behind me, the room was on fire.

My screen lit up before I could talk myself out of any of it.

Damian Mancuso – Calling…

I stared for half a ring, then answered.

“Changed my name yet?” His voice was low, unhurried, like he had all the time in the world to watch me twist.

“Don’t get ahead of yourself,” I said, trying for dry and almost getting there.

There was a quiet breath on the other end. Then:

“Don’t you want to ask,” he murmured, “what kind of marriage I want?”

I leaned back against the kitchen counter, the laminate edge pressing into my spine. A crack ran along one corner of the countertop—a tiny fracture I’d always meant to fix, but never quite had the courage to touch. Just like this life.

“Then ask it for me,” I said.

Silence stretched, soft but heavy.

“Lola,” he said at last, voice dropping, “you know I need a real marriage.”

I closed my eyes.

Outside, a siren wailed somewhere far below, then faded into the city.

“I mean it,” he went on. “I need you to fulfill all the duties of a wife. Publicly. Privately. I’m not looking for a contract on paper and two separate bedrooms. If you become my wife, I want you to be the mother of my child.”

The words landed hard and clean.

No pretending this was some whimsical second chance rom-com set up by the universe.

“My family’s been pressuring me for years,” Damian continued, matter-of-fact. “I could’ve picked any number of women if all I wanted was a womb and a surname. But I don’t want a carefully curated, dead-inside arrangement. I won’t cage myself in something hollow.”

He wasn’t boasting.

He was stating it the way men like him stated facts: calmly, as if they were gravity.

He understood me better than I understood myself. That was the dangerous part.

Because what he was really saying was:

I want a life, not a prop. I want you in that life.

I pressed my lips together. “You’re not leaving much room for misunderstanding.”

“I don’t intend to be misunderstood.”

Another siren rose and fell. Somewhere, somebody’s emergency. Mine was quieter. It sat inside my chest and watched me.

“You could say no,” Damian added after a moment. “You’ve always had that option.”

I swallowed.

“No,” I said. “I haven’t.”

“Lola—”

“I’ve had scraps,” I cut in, voice soft but sharp. “Scraps of affection. Scraps of attention. Scraps of choices that weren’t really choices at all. Stay with a man who treats my heart like a doormat, or walk away and start from zero with nothing but debt and humiliation again. Fall in line as the Genovese princess, or run to New York and pretend I’m nobody.”

I exhaled slowly.

“This is the first time someone’s put an actual door in front of me.”

He was quiet.

I realized, with a strange little twist in my chest, that I wasn’t talking to Joel’s version of me—the girl who was always grateful, always apologizing for wanting too much.

I was talking to the boy who’d once watched me share my last lollipop with him without looking away.

“If I marry you,” I said, choosing each word carefully, “I’m not doing it because I’m cornered. Or because our parents arranged it. Or because I think you’re some perfect savior.”

“No?” There was something in his tone.

“No,” I repeated. “I’m doing it because I want out of this burning building. And because you’re standing there holding open a door big enough for my pride to fit through.”

Another pause.

Then he let out a breath that sounded suspiciously like a laugh.

“This time,” I said, the words forming before I could second-guess them, “choosing to marry you isn’t a family arrangement. It’s my own decision. And I won’t walk away halfway through.”

Silence again. Different now.

He didn’t say thank you. Of course he didn’t. Damian wasn’t the type to gush.

But something in the air between us shifted.

“I’ll come to New York and bring you back,” he said. “Tomorrow.”

“Give me two weeks.”

The words came out immediately, instinctive. “There are things I need to settle. Once and for all.”

On the other end, I could almost see him reconsidering flight routes and security details in his head.

“Two weeks,” he repeated at last.

“Two weeks,” I confirmed.

“If you need anything in that time—”

“I’ll handle it,” I cut in. “You’ve got enough on your plate playing billionaire in LA, don’t you?”

He hummed, low. “You have no idea.”

I didn’t ask.

The line between curiosity and self-preservation was very thin, and I’d already crossed one line tonight.

“Goodnight, Damian.”

“Goodnight, wife-to-be,” he said softly.

When he hung up, the apartment felt different.

The sun had shifted, slipping lower, catching on the broad leaves of the bird-of-paradise plant in the corner. Dust motes floated in the air, lit up gold.

Thresholds always looked like this—ordinary, until you crossed them.

I set the phone down on the counter and stared at it for a long moment.

Then I moved.

I changed his contact name to Husband.

Then, over the next few days, I began dismantling the life I had built for another man.

I called the planner first.

She answered on the second ring, bright and efficient. “Miss Fulton! I was just about to ask about the seating chart. We still haven’t—”

“Put everything on hold,” I said.

There was a beat of stunned silence. “I—sorry?”

“Put the wedding on hold. Don’t send anything else. Don’t confirm the florist. Don’t pay the venue balance.”

Another pause. In the background, I could hear typing stop.

“Is everything alright?” she ventured. “Did something happen with Mr. Ramirez?”

Something had happened with Joel a long time ago.

I’d just finally decided to see it.

“I’ll handle Joel,” I said. “You handle the vendors.”

I spent the next three hours calling everyone.

Venue. Catering. Florist. Photographer.

I apologized where I needed to, negotiated what I could, swallowed non-refundable deposits like bitter pills. My voice stayed calm. Professional. Almost detached.

Between calls, I collected the invitations that had been left on coworkers’ desks, pinned to notice boards, tucked into café tip jars with sticky notes that said things like Take one! I’m finally getting married!.

I reclaimed every envelope.

People looked at me with confusion, pity, curiosity.

“Is everything okay?”

“Cold feet?”

“You two are perfect together!”

I smiled, thin and polite.

“Plans changed,” I said. “Sometimes that’s a good thing.”

By the time I was done, my throat was raw and my hands ached from clutching my phone.

I stacked the reclaimed invitations in a neat pile on the kitchen table. They looked smaller than they had a week ago.

Like someone else’s wedding.

I poured myself a glass of water and stood at the sink, letting the tap run over my fingers until they went numb.

The front door opened.

I didn’t turn immediately. I watched the water instead.

“Lola?”

His voice was hoarse. Not his usual smooth, controlled baritone. Roughened at the edges.

I looked up.

Joel stood just inside the doorway, white shirt wrinkled, sleeves rolled up, tie gone. The cut of his suit still screamed old money and power, but exhaustion clung to him like a second, heavier jacket.

His eyes were bloodshot. For a second, a strange pang flickered in my chest—old habit, old concern.

Then it passed.

“Call back the invitations,” he said, skipping hello altogether. “Cannon passed away last night. The family will be in mourning for at least six months. We can’t get married.”

He said it like a business update.

There was no we in it.

Just we can’t get married the way you said we can’t sign that contract.

He waited.

Waited for my outrage. For my tears. For the pleading.

Maybe he imagined me grabbing his arm, insisting we could do a small ceremony, whispering that love should matter more than old men’s rules.

I met his gaze and felt… nothing.

No hurricane. No ache.

“Cannon Ramirez,” I said quietly. “My condolences.”

Something flickered in his eyes. Confusion? Disappointment? He’d expected hysteria; he’d gotten a formal expression of sympathy.

“Today’s the memorial service,” Joel said. “Will you come with me?”

The water kept running, sliding over my fingers, cold and steady. I watched it for another three seconds, then shut it off and set the glass down.

I could still remember the first winter I’d spent in New York.

Not the curated version I told at office Christmas parties—girl from LA chasing her dreams in the big city with nothing but a suitcase and a smile.

   * Result: Ghosted.

   * Result: She laughed, called me smooth, and we have a date for coffee on Thursday.

Ideally, you want to learn to be funny yourself, but if you’re stuck in a rut, using a generator to break the ice is a cheat code. Also, this one actually gives **free rizz lines**, unlike the other apps that make you pay just to say hello.",0,1769241877.0,Bumble,1,0.5,False

(Culturally specific context),"I know Shera tells us not to meet men online but I'm from a culture where people looking for marriage can connect via specialized matrimonial sites. I'm in my late 30s, have been talking to a man in his mid-40s for a month now. He claims to be much richer than what he listed his income as and speaks regularly about his large home, several cars and businesses, frequent travels. His stories are vivid and specific so I don't have any reason to believe that he's lying. However, I cannot for the life of me find anything about him online. He lives in the US, while I'm in our home country but I've previously lived in the US.

When I say we've been talking for a month it means almost every day and a few video calls as well. The reason I entertained him was because he was very consistent with communication and made an effort to resolve problems and apologize first if we got into a heated conversation (mostly about politics, we have different views.) He has told me that he'll come visit me in March and wanted to take me on a trip to a different country, but I insisted on going to a nearby city. He is also okay with getting separate rooms in a hotel and has promised not to make a move sexually. We've been talking about the future and he seemed very solution-oriented. He's also making plans for trips we can go on together.

So far, I haven't asked him for anything specific. I asked him what he like to do on dates and he said he likes to go to coffee shops. I made a big deal about how I've never done that and would consider it an insult. He was apologetic and promised to make better plans when we met. Today, I posed an actual problem and was met with a very disappointing response. I need him to rent a graduation gown and cap for me (getting a degree soon) and bring it with him when he comes from the US, and take it back with him after I wear it for a graduation photoshoot. I gave him enough hints and expected him to offer, but he just suggested that I get it made locally. I was put off and went very quiet before telling him we'll talk later.

He has offered to help me in the future and when I talk about problems in the past he claims he would've stepped up but when I asked him for something concrete for the first time he didn't rise to the occasion. It didn't even involve a large investment of money, just some thoughtfulness on his part. I'm quite upset because I have become quite attached to him, but this is obviously not a good sign. Do I dismiss him entirely and evacuate emotionally or do I wait and watch?

1qlh1qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1qlh1qt/building_in_public_i_built_a_voicefirst_food/,Building in public: I built a voice-first food + symptom tracker (Flutter + Supabase) — looking for TestFlight beta testers,"Hey everyone — building in public here.

I’m pretty sensitive to certain foods. After a meal I can feel bloated / dizzy / uncomfortable, and doctors usually say: “Track your diet and symptoms and find patterns.”

I tried a bunch of tracking apps and couldn’t stick with them. The friction is always the same: search food items, select portions/brands, tap through forms… it feels like homework.

So I built Sympto: a voice-first food + symptom log that tries to meet you where you are (messy, human inputs) and turn that into something you can actually analyze later.

**What it does today**

* Voice → structured logs: You say something like “Slept late, had coffee, felt anxious,” and it can split that into multiple logs (sleep + food + symptom) without you choosing forms first.
* Food Lens (menu scan): Take a photo of a restaurant menu and get a quick “traffic light” style suggestion (green/yellow/red) based on your own history/preferences.
* Structured extraction: Under the hood it turns free-text into a JSON-like structure so it’s queryable later (instead of becoming a pile of notes).

**How I built it (stack)**

* Flutter for the iOS app (focused on getting iOS shipped first)
* Supabase (Postgres/Auth/Storage/Edge Functions) — the “analysis” lives in Edge Functions
* Vercel for the landing page / waitlist + domain/DNS + email sending
* TestFlight for early distribution and feedback loops

**What’s still rough (and why I’m posting)**

* Menu scanning can be slow: if a menu has tons of items, it can take 20–30 seconds. That “standing there waiting” experience isn’t great yet.
* Voice → structured output has a few seconds of latency (overall acceptable, but still something I’m trying to tighten).
* The bigger challenge: figuring out what matters most for users and ruthlessly prioritizing that instead of piling on features.

**If you’re willing to help**

I’m doing a small iOS beta via TestFlight. The site is a waitlist only because I need emails to send TestFlight invites in batches and follow up for feedback.

* Waitlist: [https://getsympto.com](https://getsympto.com)
* Once you’re in, there will also be an in-app feedback entry so you can report bugs / UX friction quickly.

**The feedback I want most (feel free to be blunt)**

* At what point would you actually use something like this?
* What’s the biggest “nope” for you (privacy, accuracy, waiting time, unclear value, etc.)?
* If you could only keep one feature: voice logging or menu scanning — which one and why?

One personal note: I’m not a “traditional coder” by background. AI helped me code, but more importantly it helped me think through the product end-to-end (inputs → structured data → storage → feedback loop → deployment/distribution). I took an [AI Architect course by Yuzheng Sun and Yage](https://www.superlinear.academy/ai-builders-eng) recently (Took their AI builder course before and it really opened me up to AI coding and what it can accomplish) and it gave me a lot of guidance for turning a messy idea into something shippable.

1qlh1mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qlh1mc/the_last_thing_my_husband_said_before_he_died/,The Last Thing My Husband Said Before He Died,"Love at first sight. Cliché, corny… and exactly how I met my husband. The ballroom was buzzing with lights and laughter. My friends dragged me along to an event hosted by their work committee. I was young and preferred libraries and coffee shops. To say the least, I was out of my comfort zone. I sipped my drink and nodded through polite conversations with my friends’ coworkers. In all honesty, I was bored. Same chats, over and over. I sat in the corner, counting ceiling tiles.

Until I heard the DJ play Madonna on the loudspeakers. No one moved, danced, or nodded along. I glanced toward the dance floor. One man stood alone, dancing as if his life depended on it. I chuckled. Not a single care in the world—just displaying every emotion in his movements, all by himself—like he’d done it a hundred times before.

He paused for a second, our eyes met, and he smiled, pointing for me to come toward him. As our eyes locked, I knew I would love this person—as friend, foe, or lover. I stepped onto the empty dance floor. No words were needed as he gently took my hand and twirled me. Every step was precise, like he’d danced this exact routine countless times before.

We danced all night. Our eyes did all the talking. When the music finally stopped, our movements froze, locked in motion. Our eyes stayed locked on each other. I sighed. “That was quite fun while it lasted.”  
 He smirked. “I missed that feeling so much.”  
 “I’ve never felt that before,” I said. “We should do it again sometime. My name’s Beck.”  
 He took my hand. “I’m Ben, and I would love to.”

Little to say, we spent the next few weeks dancing at numerous clubs around the city. Eventually, our friendship brought us to places I loved—libraries, coffee shops, and the animal shelter where I volunteered. Ben was confident, curious, and so interested in everything about me. He loved me without saying it aloud. His love was contagious. I wanted to spend every waking moment with him.

After months, I craved more. One night, I asked if he’d want to go dancing again. He eagerly agreed. The night scene never felt familiar to me, but being there with Ben changed everything. In those huge crowds, it felt like it was just the two of us—dancing alone, just like the first time we met. The music boomed. Cheers erupted. But I stayed locked on Ben. In that moment, the music silenced. I leaned in closer. “I love you,” I whispered.

He felt it too. Tears dripped down his face. “I will always love you, forever and beyond.”  
 I kissed him for the first time. It felt familiar, just like everything between us. We shortly married after that. Family and friends disagreed with our haste, but we didn’t mind. In our world, it was just us—perfect and complete.

A few years passed. We had a small apartment in the city. That feeling he brought never faded. We always danced once a week, Friday nights, after work. It was our calm, our space. The apartment was quaint but filled with joy. We even adopted a couple of cats. Everything was ideal. Ben was smart, always a step ahead. He cherished every moment with me—the morning coffee, hugs on the subway, every day together.

Then, one night on our way home, we decided to stop by our local deli. Outside, Ben’s face shifted. Concern flickered across his features.  
 “Beck, why don’t we go home tonight?” he asked.  
 I shrugged. “It’ll only take a second. Come on.”

I grabbed his arm. He didn’t move at first. Then, slowly, almost mechanically, he followed me inside. I hurried to the counter to grab our drinks and snacks. Seconds later, a masked man burst in, brandishing a firearm. He screamed obscenities, pointing the gun at me. I froze, tears spilling down my face.

I glanced back at Ben. His hands were up, tears streaming down his face. “I love you, Beck,” he said calmly.

The man behind the counter froze, hands in the air. “Relax,” Ben said, stepping forward. “Just point the gun at me. Take what you need.”

The masked man scoffed, raising the gun to Ben’s head. “Alright. Do it.”

In a flash, Ben grabbed the man’s wrist, twisting the gun away from himself. “Run!” he yelled.

I did. I ran, my legs barely moving fast enough to escape. I dialed 911, trembling. Then three gunshots rang out. I dropped my phone as glass shattered. Panic surged through me, and I ran back inside.

The counter man was dead. Ben lay on the floor, two gunshot wounds in his stomach. Blood pooled around him. I fell to my knees, clutching his hand. Tears blurred my vision.

“It will be okay, Beck,” he muttered, stroking my face gently. “I promise.”

“No! I can’t lose you, Ben!” I sobbed.

He grinned weakly. “This is the worst part… every time I come back. Not because I die, but because I have to leave you.”

I shook my head, screaming. “No! Help is coming! Stay with me!”

He coughed, blood on his lips. He pulled me closer. Then he said, quietly but clearly:

“I’ve done this hundreds of times, and I never regret it. I love you.”

I whispered back, holding him tight, “We’ll dance again soon, my love.”

He died in my arms. That was years ago. His words still linger. I don’t feel sadness anymore. Just the memory of him—and the echo of Madonna playing, and the feeling that someday, somehow, we’ll dance again.

Year after l, she got pregnant and we have a child. We sold her flat and bought a house in a small village. Since then everything went even more downhill. Now I feel like im in the place with no way out. 

I don’t have anyone to talk about it, people see us as a nice family but reality is way different. No matter what I do, she will get really angry, shouting, even in the middle of the night, slamming doors, throwing things and calling me names. Blaming me for absolutely everything. I am a morning person, I like to get up at 5am and I do tiptoe around the house to avoid any issues but if I leave, for example, bedroom door open, hell will get loose. She screamed at me because I was coughing too much in the morning while she was trying to sleep or during the day for me breathing too loud. 

Ii have to keep fixing things around the house because she is destroying them with her uncontrollable anger. 

Once I suggested to her that maybe we could record this and she can listen to herself but this was a really bad idea, she said to me I am not Johnny Depp. She gets angry on our daughter too who’s 4 this year. Simple things like dressing her makes her stressed at first then angry. 

We have a lot of financial difficulties too, is only me working now and my pay isn’t enough, we are in lot of debt. This makes it even more difficult because I am stuck and have to listen to her blaming me, how shit I am, how she hates this place and me, that I should leave. 

Many times she tells me to move out. Mamy times I woke up in the middle of the night because she was next to me saying how much she hates me. I was pretending to be asleep while tears were coming down my face. 

If I had to write down every single thing, it would be a lot to read. 

When Im downstairs on my own, drinking coffee, playing games I never know what mood she will be in today. I am trying to think of everything that could piss her off again. She got angry on me for not feeding the cats first thing in the morning, or because I left empty milk bottle on the kitchen counter, simple things but these arguments go for hours, i end up sitting and listening to this over and over and then she brings up other things from the past to keep it going. I had depression when I was a kid, multiple suicide attempts, over the years before I meet her, I fixed myself up, all of that went away but now is coming back. I am trying to stay strong for my daughter but If not that financial situation, I would find myself new place, to get away from that woman. Unfortunately I can’t do it and need to live my life this way. 

I like to draw, I used to paint but I feel more comfortable with pencils, I set up my desk in the bedroom, she hates it. She will tell how there’s no problem with me going upstairs and draw for hours but whenever there’s occasion, she will bring this up and blast me for doing this. For having hobbies. It put me down and I don’t do it as often anymore. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. This whole post is probably hard to read. I am writing it down few minutes after she screamed at me for that bedroom door again. She called me selfish and inconsiderate. Went up, slammed the door, screamed there, came downstairs again to tell me how bad shit I am, went up again, and that on repeat. Saying it’s my fault shes awake now. So i told her if she didn’t scream and got so angry, she would be sleeping but all I heard was fuck off. 

Please, what can I do? Is there absolutely anything I could do? I don’t know how much longer I can keep up with it. Been years. Few years back she threw bagels at the floor in front of me, why? Because I said Im not hungry now so she got offended and said that i am calling her fat because she wanted to eat. This still goes even now, when I am busy with something, I usually forget about hunger and she takes it personally asking me why am I starving myself, she is hungry but because I didn’t eat anything she isn’t allowed to eat either.

I (30F) lost my partner (M29) when he chose to end his life a few months back, and am trying to get through the process of grieving and acceptance, and so forth. We were in a complicated situation of being in different countries so I flew over to his home country to see him off (or I hoped I could) as soon as possible. 

My partner's best friend (M31) was another person who flew over to see him off at the funeral procession and I thought having someone familiar would make the situation easier to handle. For context he was the one who had contacted me about my partner's passing because he found out first, but I had details to my partner's address, access codes, location. 

However best friend flipped the switch: not updating me in a timely manner, not letting the family know about me (we weren't ready to meet each other's family just yet FYI, but I keep wondering why I couldn't be introduced as a friend), only vaguely telling me about funeral details and so I missed out on it all.  The only reason I ended up being able to pay my respects post-funeral was because I had figured out directions and ran into my partner's mom, and I got to pay respects on his birthday, a day before I flew out.

Back home now, the best friend has sporadically checked up on me but I feel like it's only when it suits him. He'll call and unpromptedly share that he got to speak to my partner's other friends, siblings, parents, and how everyone loves him and is so appreciative of him being around for my partner. He'll call in tears and talk about how they were brothers. He'll ask to get coffee and talk about scenarios where they got to have a full friendship circle etc, while lightly asking how I am before turning it back on himself.

I feel like there's this weird hero complex to look after me but also boxing me in to make sure I know that I wouldn't be as important as he is, in my partner's life. I also communicate with my partner's friends and family, but I seem to internalise it completely.

Not once have I felt welcome to share my thoughts, my sadness, my stories. I feel like a lot of my grievances gets pushed to the side to accomodate the best friend's feelings like a sounding board and I always leave upset, exhausted and two steps back emotionally from where I could be with my own healing process. Why I keep doing it? I think because he is the only direct /close connection I have to my partner. 

I've started to gradually stopped communicating with the best friend, but my guilt is eating at me because we're obviously going through this shared trauma, and aside from my partner's (other) friends in his home country, the best friend and I were the only two who have had to go through this loss at a very close proximity. I want to completely disappear from the best friend's life so I can properly start to heal from what is a life-altering experience but not sure if it'll make me a horrible person because everyone needs someone, during grief.

DA deactivated due to marriage pressure?","This might be a bit unusual for some people in this subreddit, but try to understand it from a different/islamic perspective. Sometimes can be a blessing due to not dragging things way too far or spending years upon years.

We (M24, F25) are both from a western country, in Europe specifically, where meeting other Muslims can sometimes be very difficult. Due to this, we met on a more untraditional platform, namely a Facebook matchmaking profile. The 'dating' life for us are a bit different than in typical western situations. It's straight to marriage (Nikkah, to be specific), since actual 'dating' is not allowed. I made a post in a Muslim subreddit too, where one commentor mentioned attachment styles - which sparked a whole different line of thoughts. Many suspected she wrote to multiple men, but I genuinely do not believe this.

**Some background**  
Everything on paper seemed good. Too good to be true, almost. We aligned on absolutely everything, from our goals and ambitions in life, to personality traits, religion, education and so on.

The main problem is that there was not once during those 2 months, that she had “gotten feelings” for me at all. We exchanged pictures on day 2, where we both accepted how the other person looked like, and personally I have not had problems with my looks. This was my second time talking marriage, where the first girl became interested after an hour of talking and had her decision ready after two weeks (which even I find fast, but remember islamic context here).

We have went on a total of 4 dates, first two being coffee dates, one bowling and the other movies + restaurant. She always enjoyed the dates, and so did I. But, after each date, I could always feel a shift. The frequency of the messages went from fun and lengthy talks to short and direct messages. This would usually last 1-4 days, after which the 'atmosphere' became normal again. Roughly 5-20 messages those specific days, otherwise 100+.

She always told me, that she had a positive outlook on the marriage, and just 15 days ago told me, that she leans more towards a yes. Behavior wise, she didn’t seem like a person who was deeply uninterested in me.  
Some things I can think of:

* Wrote many sweet messages, showed interest in me and my days
* Said yes to be there for my graduation in June (so, 5 months in advance)
* Talked about our 'future child'.
* That I was a golden person.
* Showed extreme care for everything, especially when I was sick with influenza.
* Told me face-to-face on our third date, that she leaned towards a yes and that she genuinely believed she could not find anyone better (a mix between personality, religion, etc). It was also the third date, that she would decide to fully continue or not. Since we continued, I assumed she made her decision.

4 days later after our fourth meeting, I got a message that she has 0 feelings and had to end it, making it very direct that “her heart feels nothing”, that she ""feels zero"" and she never got feelings at all.

We had daily contact, deep conversations, and in my opinion, chemistry as well. We wrote nearly 13.000 messages over 52 days. She did mention early on that she is ""slow to catch feelings,"" but her behavior suggested she was interested. I also learned, that with avoidants, you have to play 'hard to get'. I didn't. I think the feelings were lacking due to constantly writing, which I want opinions about too.

How can someone write 13k messages, plan for my graduation, call me ""golden"" and a 'heart that was on the right place' (even in the breakup text), and then claim she felt *nothing* the entire time?

I sent two final messages. One sweet and long, where I kind of praised/complimented her a lot, and other one, after a few hours and thinking, told her that I deserved better and know my worth. But she has NOT left the group chat, and I can see that she STILL checks the app (""Last seen recently"" on Telegram). She has 0 other things on Telegram besides our groupchat, since the matchmaker used that app.

**My Questions:**

1. What is actually going on? Is the *""I never felt anything""* a deactivation lie or is it true?
2. Why stay in the group chat and stalk the app if she feels ""zero""?
3. Is this a permanent discard, or just panic because marriage became too real?
4. What is the chance that she will come back? I understand avoidants quickly regret?",1,1769241042.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1qlh03z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoir/comments/1qlh03z/chapter_ii_a_new_beginning/,Chapter II: A New Beginning,"[**A.    My highly sensitive**]()

I got a job offer yesterday. It is a construction company headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, a major city in the south of my country. They have a project through my province. So now I am in a rented room in another town to facilitate the new job. This job means a lot to me. You will know why later. That is not a very happy story. The issue I want to raise in this book has caused me and my people so much trouble, I personally feel it is unnecessary to tell a non-fiction story that is not finished and will probably have a lasting impact starting with sad stories, so I will tell you that story later.

The room is about 20m^(2), cleaned before I come. The house owner is an old couple. They say they ran a karaoke bar but a few months ago, they started to use the rooms for rent. No wonder I see an A4 piece of paper paste on the wall in the bathroom: ""Please do not throw trash in the toilet"". And a wash basin and a table placed outside the bathroom must have been added later, for cooking, as they say. I bought a mattress, pillow, blanket, a small table, a small clothes rack for the room, and some essential items for the bathroom.

After arranging those things, I went out to take a look around this place. I live in the center of town, next to the market. As my house owner said, the market was on this side, it was moved to the other side of the street one year ago. A few remaining stores are eating houses and barber shops. They look old but there are more customers coming to those stores than the restaurants and salons newly built. I do not want to eat or cut my hair, so I walk back and cross the street. The market closed. I see only a few fruit stalls and clothing stores still open. I do not want to buy clothes either, so I skip those stores, continue walking. Around the market is more bustling. There are many eateries: coffee bars, snack bars,… Here and there are a few lots under construction.

I stop in front of a bright yellow milk tea cart. Looking at the decoration and the bartender, I think the taste will not be bad. I ordered a cup of traditional milk tea with flan and black sugar boba. While waiting, I see a young couple comes over. Almost everyone turns their attention to them. The girl has a beautiful body and dresses quite coolly, while the boy is holding her hand very proudly.

\-       What does this young lady want to buy? – An employee asks the girl.

\-       Yes, a cup of green tea with a full topping.

\-       Just wait a minute.

\-       Yes.

A carefully made cup of green tea rapidly is quickly given to the girl.

\-       Madam, yours is 30,000. – Another employee says.

I stand there, and see the surrounding air changes instantly. The girl receives the milk tea with shame. She awkwardly pays. The boy shyly avoids the gazes of the others, who their jealousy was satisfied and are enjoying the despicable pleasure of bringing down the couple. Some others quickly turn away, as if they are afraid that someone will point out and criticize their ability to evaluate beauty and ugliness. And two employees exchange their glances and smile with each other, I know this has probably happened many times before.

A lot of questions appear in my mind: Why are those two employees so mean? Why is the girl shameful? Why does the boy shyly avoice others? Why does he not hold his girl hand tighter? Why do the others have that despicable pleasure? Why do some others have to turn away? And why do I realize things others cannot realize? Why cannot I just think like them? What good are these thoughts of mine?

But I just keep silent. I say to myself: “I am just a common person, my different thinking is useless” every time I encounter situations like this. I still do not understand why but it seems that in fact, people do not often think rationally nor do they want to think rationally. There was a time when I thought that if I saw something absurd, I would just say it and everything would be fine. But it is not like that. I know there is a high probability that if I say my thoughts now, all those people, will not be able to accept the shame of having their dark sides exposed and will rely on the crowd to laugh at me, including the girl, she will not feel grateful but feels relieved, because the shame is transferred from her to me, and very willing to turn her back on me.

In reality, there are even more extreme cases, when passersby dare not to stop to help people in accidents, because they themselves become the target of being cursed, beaten and forced to compensate the accident victim. Humans are so funny.

The employee gives me the milk tea cup with both hands, big smiles and speaks warmly:

\-       Thank you for your support. If you find it delicious, please come back and support us next time.

I do not like this. That is really sarcastic when she neglected her role as an employee by behaving so shamefully towards her customer, and then she uses the employee role to enjoy the results of that behavior. She was enthusiastic towards me to pretend not to know what was going on and show to everyone that she is just a very exemplary employee, making her shameful behavior look like she was just casually stating the truth. This also helps those who felt gloating are relieved, thinking that their support on the good side saves them from unpleasant feelings. They actually felt a sense of shame in their hearts for the joy they had, so they have a urge to erase that feeling to rebalance. She gave them a reason for them to think that they are still good people.

I do not want to become indifferent. I do not want to turn a blind eye either. But I also do not want to bring trouble upon myself. I look deep into her eyes, keep it so long and she understands. She feels uneasy, blinks and diffidently looks away. I hope If she knows somebody may see her malice, she will stop doing such behaviors.

I keep walking and in a corner, I see a karaoke bar. I am more interested in it than other shops, so I step inside.

\-       How many people are going? – The receptionist stands up and asks me.

\-       I go alone.

\-       Just you?

\-       Have you never seen anyone sing karaoke alone?

\-       Not yet.

\-       Now you see. Just get me a plate of fruit. And can I bring this milk tea cup?

\-        Yes. Do you have any other requests?

\-       No.

He leads me into the first room, right behind the reception desk.

I ask for the light to be as bright as possible, no flashing lights, no air conditioning, just fan and sit down near the song selection board. It is a small room, with a U-shaped sofa running along three walls, a stone table in the middle, and a stereo system on the opposite side. There are no pictures or other decorations.

It has been a few months since I last sang. “Hoping I do not sit here crying” – I say and laugh at myself. I smile at my own foolishness when I realize I am wondering which song to sing first. “You are just singing karaoke alone now” – I remind myself and press “ARTR”, then choose the first line “A Realm to Return” and grab the mic. Thinking back to the past, I am afraid that I will sing heavily. But it turns out that when I sit here and sing to myself, I find myself singing very calmly, without any bitterness or sadness.

I have sung for two hours, singing all kinds of songs: western and eastern, old and new, happy and sad, love and broken hearts… Letting all my emotions rise up, and pour them all out.

If I have been deliberately peeling off layers of my thoughts through posts for so long but still never felt like I was fully myself, then I accidentally found that in my voice. It is not because it is good like people say. Others may not know, but I know my voice has defects. This is okay with me, actually. I am not a singer. So instead of spending time and effort to overcome those defects by others standards, I try to sing as I really want.

The receptionist said with admiration: “You sing so well” when I pay the bill. I smile at him. My voice seems to be the only thing that harmonizes between me and this world. I can be myself and others still like it. Left, I have to hear things like: You need to be like this when you go to school, like that when you go to work, you have to behave like this in this situation, you have to feel like that in that situation... I am so sick of these stereotypes, I do not fit into any of them.

 

While surfing Facebook, I see a video sharing an office staff’s thoughts in a day, both real and satirical. “Yes, work has its unpleasant situations, but somehow it is fun.” - I say to myself, remembering the happy times at my old company.

For more than two years since I created Lac Lac, Facebook has given me the feeling that it understands me more and more, as if it has followed me everywhere, was happy with me, sad with me, even guided me when I was confused, gave me suggestions when I had problems.

I see another post with the caption “After the darkest night, the sun will rise every morning”, I think it is talking to me, I am almost sure it knows I will have a new start tomorrow.

Scrolling down a bit more, the chorus of the song “A Flowery Path” ring out loudly:

“…I silently pray that youth with many wishes will bloom everywhere

Bringing you under that roof in the storm

Hope that time will erase all lies and vanity…”

“What a great song for today!” I copy the link and open Lac Lac to post it, with the caption above.",1,1769240950.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False
1qlgzy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qlgzy9/updated_profile/,Updated profile?,"Basically I’m kind of aware I can’t be annoyed, and I guess I’m not, more disappointed tbh, but I matched with this girl, she’s 23 (as am I), and she even messaged me first. 

We had like two full days of hours worth of good convo, I found an opening and asked her out, she said yes, switched to socials instead of dating app too. It was a good first date, had a coffee, walked for hours, ended with a kiss. 

Chatted a lot after that, but it’s died down a little which is fine, we agreed on a second date anyway. It’s still going ahead I think, but it’s been a while since the first, we do live an hour away tho, so it’s not ideal. But I checked the app and saw she has recently changed some prompts and info and stuff. Idk just made me feel bad.

I get that’s what dating is, and I am being pragmatic generally, but in a sense I kind of hate that? I can accept that for a job and shit, but this is meant to be romance and love? And maybe some people want to date around but that wasn’t her. I get trying for options and stuff, and it has only been one thing I do get all that, really! 

But idk, when I was a kid I had this idea about like movie romance and finding a great love, and I know that’s not the real world in most ways. I did find this girl who was amazing in almost every way ages ago, but it turned out she has this bf. I dislike the guy too, and they don’t seem as compatible as we were BUT I accepted it and have moved on. 

Point being, I just don’t like opening myself up and putting myself out there, only for it to turn out someone else is out there with other people and I’m more a possible option rather than the real thing. Not to say THIS is it, but in a general sense. Maybe it’s just the apps tbh, maybe just meeting someone who doesn’t use them and I can meet as friends first makes more sense. Idk.

1qlgyqp,https://i.redd.it/t9n1bw8259fg1.png,The woman at the counter repeated for the third time,"“I’m sorry, Ms. Cole,” the woman at the counter repeated for the third time, like sorry could put a roof over my head. “Your dorm assignment was… displaced.”



“Misplaced,” the guy beside her corrected under his breath.



“Displaced,” she insisted, smiling through her teeth as if smiling could file paperwork. “The point is, the room you were promised is unavailable.”



“The point,” I echoed, because apparently we were playing a game, “is that I’m standing here with two suitcases, a scholarship, and exactly forty-two dollars until my first stipend hits, and you’re telling me I’m homeless on day one?”



Her smile widened a millimeter. “Not homeless. Call it… creative housing.”



I blinked. “Is that a new major?”



Behind me, someone snorted. In front of me, the woman sighed in a way that said I was the fiftieth problem she’d handled today and the only one that persisted this long.



The thing was, I was already two weeks behind in the semester, because it cost me a tooth and a literal toenail on a site I wished never to visit again, to buy my ticket to come here.



Another delay was not what I needed right now.



The receptionist clicked across her screen, as she tapped her nails. I tried to stare at the sunlit lobby of Blackridge University’s Housing Office just to distract myself while she checked.



It really was a beautiful campus and everything I ever dreamed of. And although I was transferring in my third year out of four, I was grateful that I’d have two years at my dream school.



That is, if this issue is resolved and I get a place to rest my head.



“Look,” I said, lowering my voice. “I transferred late because I had some issues and my internship officially starts tomorrow. Admissions fast-tracked me, and housing was confirmed. I sold my soul to a color-coded spreadsheet—”



“Which we appreciate,” she murmured.



“—and I don’t have anyone in this city. Or… at all, really.” It slipped out before I could stop it. “So if you could just… ‘creatively’ house me in a room with four walls, that would be amazing. The janitor’s closet would suffice until a student or two decides college is not their cup of tea and decide to drop out prematurely.”



She snorted, but I was dead serious.



She opened her mouth to respond with another apology, I’m sure, but her obnoxious sounding telephone rang, and she grabbed it without a second thought.



I couldn’t hear the conversation, but she ‘yeah’ and ‘uh-huhed’ through the entire thing while my anxiety ate me whole.



When she finally ended the call, she gave me a look of complete relief, that I was sure had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her just wanting to get rid of me.



“So, turns out, we can place you,” she said finally, and my heart skipped in joy. “At Blackridge House, off-campus.”



My relief and celebration was cut short. “The alumni guest house?”



Her colleague coughed. “The Alpha House.”



I laughed, because the alternative was fainting.



“Right. The Alpha House. Is that some type of weird way of saying some frat house or something?”



The receptionist’s colleague gave me a confused look, but she shot him a glare that seemed to communicate something that I didn’t understand, because he burned bright red and ducked his head as if he realized something that I couldn’t place.



“It’s not a frat house,” the lady said. “and it’s not what you applied for, but it will do for the first semester at least, and it’s free.”



Now that caught my attention.



“It’s a formal courtesy for the displacement,” she added, sliding a carbon-copy form toward me. “Housing covers the rent, utilities, and a transport stipend for this semester, on us, because the mistake was ours.”



“Free?” I echoed. “No catch? No human-sacrifice system that I don’t know about?”



“Free. No catch,” she said, and the smile finally looked like policy instead of pity. “We messed up your placement, so the university makes it right.”



I hummed and I stared at the address on the paper she handed to me.



“Any surprises I should know about?” I asked tentatively.



Her smile seemed strained now. “It’s either this,” she said, printing the keycard, “or a hotel for three weeks at your expense.”



Forty-two dollars, a Dominoes gift card and two fake silver earrings was not going pay for that.



I bit my cheek and took the key.



“Creative housing it is,” I said.



She smiled genuinely this time as her eyes caught someone behind us.



“Elise!” she called, waving over a girl with glossy hair, a pressed polo, and the kind of planner that could run a small country. I liked her already.



Elise reached the counter in three crisp strides. Up close, she smelled faintly like citrus and old books.



“Please,” the receptionist said, relief leaking into her tone. “Could you show Ms. Cole to Blackridge House?”



Elise’s smile held, but something akin to shock flickered in her eyes before she schooled it smooth.



“Of course.” She turned to me, extending a hand. “Elise Hart. Campus ambassador and chronic overachiever.”



“Maya,” I said, shaking it. “Same, actually,” I laughed. “I mean, the overachiever part… Not the ambassador because obviously I wasn’t here to be an …“ I coughed to hide my embarrassing rambling. “Nice to meet you.”



“Same.” Her smile seemed real, and her fingers were cool and firm. She tipped her head slightly—just a subtle lift of her nose, like she was… sniffing me?



My stomach dropped. Great. I must’ve smelled like a bus-station chic. I should’ve bought the travel-size perfume instead of the emergency ramen.



We set off, the afternoon sun sliding warm across brick paths. Blackridge unfurled around us. It was mostly old stone halls, glass windows, and beautiful ivy climbing along the bricks.



Elise moved at a purposeful clip that said she didn’t believe in being late to anything, ever.



“Quick hits,” she said. “Dining hall coffee is a cry for help, the library closes at midnight but not really, and if you hear the bell tower at three a.m., you didn’t.”



“Didn’t what?”



“Exactly.” She flashed me a grin. “Your internship’s in Comms & Policy, right? I’m in that program too. I’ll see you in Professor Lang’s seminar and at work tomorrow.”



Relief loosened something in my chest. “So I’ll know one person in the room who can probably perform CPR on my social awkwardness.”



She laughed. “I can. Also on actual people.” She glanced over, friendly and curious, that tiny nose-lift again like a reflex. “New perfume?”



“New city,” I deflected, and she let it go.



We crossed a footbridge where a small stream sat, and passed a lawn where a frisbee nearly decapitated me. Elise didn’t break stride, and I respected that.



“Almost there,” she said, nodding ahead.



I nodded as we continued. “Are there rules?”



“Oh yes,” she said without looking away from the hill. “Rule one: Don’t die.”



I shot Elise a look. She didn’t look like she was joking.



“Half humor,” she said brightly, then lowered her voice. “Some houses like their privacy.”



The house appeared like it had been set down by a hand that did not accept ‘good enough.’ It was massive, antique, but beautiful. It’s structure was like most of the University’s, but there was something distinct about it that made it seem almost… homely, yet repulsive to intruders.



My feet stopped. “That’s… a house.”



“Mm-hmm. Welcome to Blackridge House.”



“What’s the cost for a night at a hotel here again?”



Elise’s smile tilted. “Good luck.”



I did a double-take. “You’re not coming with me?”



“Oh, no.” She tapped the face of her watch. “I have a lab. But I’ll see you in seminar and at work tomorrow, yeah?”



“Yeah.” I swallowed. “Tomorrow.”



She squeezed my forearm—quick and warm—and peeled away the way she’d arrived: neat, efficient, and a little too observant.



I dragged my duffel up the front steps. Housing had promised to send my suitcases by car, which was either very kind or them laundering their guilt. The door was unlocked, which felt like either a trap or confidence. I chose confidence because I had to choose something.



The foyer was cool, quiet, the kind of put-together that whispers don’t touch. Low voices threaded in from deeper inside. Male voices.



I followed them.



I turned into the living room and stopped so fast the duffel thumped my calf.



Three men looked up at me from three separate places.



One stepped out from the hallway still wet from a shower, a white towel slung low on his hips, and water sliding in clean lines over his chest.



Across the room, another stood at the entrance to what seemed like the kitchen, in an apron that definitely wasn’t his, oven mitt on one hand.



And the third was kneeling on the rug with a screwdriver and the gutted belly of a robot vacuum between his knees.



Nobody spoke. Neither did I.



By the looks on their faces, they were just as surprised by the news as I was.



“Hi,” I said, because my mouth was a traitor. “Creative housing?”



Chapter 2

Maya



An overpriced hotel was really looking good right now.



“I come in peace,” I called, because I wanted to live, “and also with paperwork.”



The first to move was the one who looked like he’d been carved out of shadow and expectations. He was tall, had broad shoulders and dark hair, pushed back with ruthless efficiency.



His gray eyes watched me like they’d already assessed all my flaws and filed them alphabetically. The scar through his eyebrow should’ve made him prettier; it made him colder. And he was shirtless… Very, very shirtless.



My eyes did a terrified hop from abs to ceiling, then to the floor like I’d stared straight at the sun. I could feel the heat crawling up my ears and cheek. I shifted from my right leg to the left, hoping with everything in me that he didn’t just see that.



“Lost?” he said.



“Placed,” I said, holding up the keycard. “By Housing.”



His gaze flicked to the card, then to me, to the duffle bag on my shoulder, then to my face again. He didn’t smile.



The way he looked at me was cruel and clinical… like he was cutting me raw with teh sharpness of his gaze. Something in my shoulders pulled tight like I’d been called to stand still while someone measured me.



I watched the calculations happening in his head—subtle shifts in his jaw as if he were sorting me into a criterion.



“We’re not a dorm,” he said flatly.



“So I hear.” I gulped, shifting the weight of the bag to my next thigh. “And apparently also not a sorority.” That part wasn’t supposed to be heard, but they all seemed to hear it just the same, all three rewarding me with different looks, ranging from disapproval to downright humor. I didn’t even know I said that so loud.



The joke caught on a dry throat, and I cleared it once before my mouth remembered how to behave.



The other man who just ditched his apron, leaned on the doorway, dark curls messy and blue eyes bright with the sort of trouble that didn’t apologize afterward. He grinned when I looked up, and it lit the room.



“Welcome to the fortress, sweetheart,” he said. “I’m Caden. He’s Ty,” he said, motioning to the shirtless super model still glaring at me. “Don’t mind the glower,” he added softer, but evidently wanted him to hear. “It’s chronic.”



Ty didn’t look away from me. “Tylon,” he corrected mildly. “And no.”



His words came out clipped and controlled, like he was barely restraining himself from growling or something. A small tick in his jaw said the correction wasn’t negotiable.



“No… what?” I asked.



“No, you can’t stay.”



“Fun story,” I said, smile bright and completely fake. “I actually don’t want to stay here. But if I don’t, I stay nowhere. And I have to be at the Comms & Policy internship building at eight a.m. bright-eyed and not smelling like a bus station tomorrow morning. So unless Housing intends to bunk me in a filing cabinet—”



“Let me see the authorization,” Ty said, cutting me off with his palm out.



I handed it over. He read the memo about temporary placement, capacity issues, and needing their compliance.



He went very still with the paper steady in one hand, his shoulders squared, and his eyes tracking down the text like he was checking for a loophole. Whatever it said, his jaw ticked once, and he passed the card back.



“Temporary,” he said.



“Thrilling,” I replied.



Caden moved towards me and took my duffel bag, and the relief was instant.



“I’ve got it,” he murmured as the strap slid off my shoulder under his hand, and his fingers brushed mine in a quick, reassuring caress.



He wore an easy grin, easy posture, and even gave me a little shoulder bump that said it would be fine even if nothing else seemed so. For a reckless second, I almost believed it. He had that type of effect, it seemed.



“We can put her in the sunroom,” he said as he tossed it over his shoulder.



“We are not putting a stranger in the sunroom,” Tylon said.



“Guest suite, then,” Caden said, without turning.



“Not the guest suite.”



There was a light chuckle, and it was then that I remembered the third man who was still kneeling in front of the broken vacuum. He brushed off his jeans as he stood, and I realized right there and then that i was placed in a house with three Greek god-looking men to live with for a whole semester, or more.



God, help me.



He looked younger than Caden and Tylon, but he wasn’t any less magnificent. They were all handsome in their own way, and I had no idea if there were anymore.



His hazel eyes glittered with a mixture of indifference, but feeding into Caden’s humor.



“Library couch?” he offered.



“Stop helping,” Tylon growled.



“Hi,” I said to the third one, seizing the gap. “I’m Maya, by the way. I’m very organized, I clean up after myself, I label things in a way that is helpful and not creepy, and I make coffee that will make up for the awful one they make here, apparently.”



Something like humor touched his eyes. “Leonardo. Leo for short,” he said. “Coffee is a strong argument.”



Ty’s gaze cut to me, then to the ceiling, then back like he was considering letting me stay and throwing me out.



“I will take this up with the heads, but for now, house rules,” he said finally. “No parties without agreement. No guests without notice. No entering rooms that aren’t yours. No going downstairs after midnight.”



Caden glanced back. “That last one isn’t real.”



“It is now.”



Leo leaned against the doorframe where Caden previously was, with his hands in his pocket. “She’s clearly capable of handling herself. No one’s scared of your scowl, Ty.”



“She should be. She’s human,” Ty said.



“‘She’ is standing right here!” I huffed, hating that the conversation seemed to be flying over me. “And are you insinuating that you’re not? What are you? Some super-human just because you seem to wear a permanent scowl and bossy pants?”



I heard Caden draw a sharp breath, and Leo’s eyes widened. And suddenly, I felt like I just crossed a line.



But I wasn’t about to let him treat me like some incompetent child, just because we were forced into something that none of us were ready for or wanted. But what the hell can I do about it?



Absolutely nothing. So we just had to live with it.



Silence reigned for a few seconds, and I didn’t miss the way Caden edged towards me, as if he was preparing to jump in front of me should Tylon leap.



He didn’t crowd me… just angled himself a breath closer, like a steady heat at my side and a buffer if I needed it. Weirdly, that tiny, ordinary detail calmed me more than anything.



But instead, Tylon simply mumbled, “Just remember the rules,” and left.



“Right,” Caden said after a beat. “That settles it. Sunroom it is.”



Rule number one: Don’t die.



Got it.



Chapter 3

Maya



“This is you,” Caden said, showing me into the sunroom.



There was glass on three sides of the room, a low bed, and yellow curtains that made the room even brighter.



“It’s… a greenhouse with delusions of a bedroom,” I said before I could stop myself.



But he laughed, the kind of laugh was warm and makes a place feel less like a stranger.



“Technically it’s a room,” he said, dropping my bag at the foot of the bed. “But your description has better PR.”



He didn’t leave. Of course he didn’t. He leaned a palm on the doorframe and looked around like he was measuring whether the light would bother me at dawn, whether the latch would stick, whether I cared. That last one, I wasn’t sure about.



“You keep a planner,” he said, tipping his chin at the one tucked under my arm. “Color-coded.”



“It’s how I know what to panic about,” I half-joked. “Red is due now, orange is due an hour ago, yellow is me pretending it can wait.”



“And blue?”



“Blue is coffee.”



“Then we’ll get along,” he mused, evoking another real laugh from me.



I had a feeling coffee wasn’t the thing that would make us get along.



He stepped in, close enough that I caught the clean, warm smell of his soap and something sharper that wasn’t cologne.



He reached for the curtain chord just as I did, and his hand grazed mine. He didn’t move away quickly, but he didn’t make it a moment either, and both choices said he knew exactly what he was doing.



“We’ll get you a blackout shade if the sunrise is too much,” he said in a cool, chill voice that made me see another part of him. “Or you can juts come to my room.”



I snorted and gave him a pointed look. “How many girls have you given that speech to?”



“Two,” he said lightly, then held my gaze. “Counting you.”



I shouldn’t have smiled. But I absolutely did.



A soft knock hit the doorframe behind him.



Leo entered with towels, some sheets and blankets and one of my two suitcases.



“These just arrived,” he said, rolling in the second behind the first. “And I got you these just in case none was in here.”



“Thanks,” I said, taking them. His fingers brushed mine, brief and warm, much like when it happened with Caden. But with Leo, I couldn’t quite tell where he stood.



He hadn’t been downright cold like Tylon, nor openly welcoming like Caden. He just seemed… polite. Like he was doing the bare minimum because he was stuck in this situation too, and not because he actually wanted me here.



Still, I appreciated the gesture, and I smiled just the same as I pulled away my hand.

1qlgw49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cirrhosis/comments/1qlgw49/im_worried_that_i_have_cirrhosis/,I'm worried that I have cirrhosis.,"On Tuesday this week, I vomited that digested blood that looks like coffee grounds, and as a result went to the ER. They said that my blood work was normal aside from a slight lack of potassium, but they wanted to do an endoscopy to make sure. Since I couldn't afford to take an extra day off of work, I declined the endoscopy, which I'm somewhat regretting as I don't know exactly what I have. I don't know if I have an ulcer or esophageal varices, which would explain why I vomited black blood and which would indicate that I have cirrhosis. I was a heavy drinker for four and a half years until this happened, so that would explain one of those conditions. However, I don't have any other evident symptoms of cirrhosis aside from having vomited black blood. I don't have jaundice, I don't have any signs of ascites aside from a very slight beer gut that disappears if I stand up straight, and I don't have red palms, all being symptoms associated with the esophageal varices stage of cirrhosis? Maybe I have occasional fatigue, but I feel like everyone gets that. If I had gotten the endoscopy, maybe they could have confirmed what the deal is, and I'm intending to schedule one myself, although I'm having trouble fitting it with my work schedule. My question is if anyone here more familiar with cirrhosis might shed some light, if nothing else to clear my head? Are there other conditions that could cause coffee grounds vomiting, probably related to alcoholism? I'm really worried that I'm not only not going to get to eat what I want anymore, but also that my life expectancy might be shorter than hoped without me knowing it.",2,1769240565.0,Cirrhosis,0,1.0,False

1qlguge,https://www.reddit.com/r/macedonia/comments/1qlguge/opportunity_from_bulgaria/,Opportunity from Bulgaria,"Dear Macedonian brothers and sisters,

As a proud Bulgarian from Sofia, I look at our beautiful Balkans and can’t help but notice how Lake Ohrid — that UNESCO pearl — is sadly stuck with you. While Bulgaria has been steadily climbing the economic ladder (our GDP per capita is already more than double yours, around $22-24k vs your \~$9-10k), we see North Macedonia still struggling with stagnation, corruption, low wages, and endless EU delays.

So, inspired by the Americans’ cheeky Greenland idea, here’s a serious yet friendly offer from Bulgaria: We’ll buy Lake Ohrid from you for a very generous price — let’s say enough to give your economy a real boost, pay off some debts, and finally get your people out of poverty. With our funds and management, we’ll turn it into an even bigger tourist magnet, protect it properly from pollution, and make sure the rakija flows freely for everyone.

Think about it:

•  No more worrying about UNESCO threats or environmental scandals on your watch.

•  Your budget gets a massive injection while we handle the jewel of the Balkans like the responsible EU member we are.

•  We share the lake’s beauty anyway — why not let the richer, more stable neighbor take the reins and lift the whole region?

Of course, if you’re too attached to your little lake (and your endless excuses for why you’re still behind), just say no. But deep down, you know Bulgaria could do it so much better.

What do you say, Skopje? Ready to cash in and let the big boys handle the gem? 🇧🇬💰

Let’s discuss over a coffee — or better yet, over some Bulgarian yogurt and banitsa on our side of the border.

Chapter 1 

The doctors said I wouldn’t live to see fifteen. 

9 

Von Willebrand disease-the name was too long for me to remember fully. I only held onto what it meant: my blood had forgotten how to 

clot, and any tiny cut could kill me. 

The day I was diagnosed at ten, I could hear Mom sobbing through the clinic door. 

After that, I became the “fragile girl.” My world shrank to clotting factor injections, medical bills, and the exhaustion that settled deeper 

in my parents’ eyes each day. 

But here I am, almost eighteen-just three days until Lina and I turn eighteen. 

We’re twins, though in the mirror she stands half a head taller, her cheeks flushed with color, her eyes bright like mine used to be before 

the diagnosis. 

“Ella, you’re really not coming?” Lina stood in my doorway wearing her graduation gown. 

Today was her high school graduation ceremony. She was the valedictorian, scheduled to give a speech. 

And me? I hadn’t set foot in a classroom since my diagnosis. I used to be an honor student too, used to dream about standing on stages 

and making a difference. Now I just watched from bed as she lived the life I should have had. 

“My knee’s killing me.” I pressed my right knee. “I can’t stand for long.” 

12:23 Sat, Jan 24 M… 

I Didn’t Die From My Disease, I Died From Neglect 

Mom rushed in, car keys clutched in her fist. “Lina, we’re going to be late!” 

She saw my hand on my knee and her voice caught. “It’s acting up again? Today of all days?” 

“Mom, I don’t think I can make it…” 

“Eight years. She cut me off, her voice shaking. “Every single important day for Lina, you get sick. Every single one.” 

79 

“I’m really hurting…” 

“Really?” Mom suddenly grabbed the medication box from the coffee table-next week’s clotting factor, three thousand dollars a box. “For this, I quit my job to take care of you full-time! For this, we sold everything we could!” 

The box trembled in her hands. 

“Just today,” she stared at me, “let Lina have her graduation. Let your mother catch her breath. Please?” 

I opened my mouth but no words came out. 

The box slipped from her grasp. 

The glass vial shattered with a crisp sound. Fragments scattered everywhere, and one shard grazed my ankle-barely a scratch that wouldn’t need a Band-Aid for anyone else. 

But my blood doesn’t clot. 

Droplets welled up. One, two, then a thin line. 

The air went still. 

“I’ll get gauze!” Lina spun toward the bathroom. 

“Stop!” Mom’s voice was ice cold. “Let her handle it herself.” 

She grabbed her keys and Lina’s wrist. “We’re leaving.” 

“But Ella…” 

“Now!” 

The door slammed shut. 

I stood alone, watching blood trail down to my foot and drip onto the light wood floor-the same floor Mom mopped every day. 

12:23 Sat, Jan 24 M… 

I Didn’t Die From My Disease, I Died From Neglect 

I crouched down, trying to wipe it with my sleeve. The blood just smeared, spreading into a larger stain. 

Cold crept through my body, starting from my toes. I knew this feeling too well. 

I stumbled toward the bathroom-my sanctuary, where I soaked in warm baths during every bleeding episode. 

Sinking into the bathtub, the warm water temporarily chased away the chill. 

I reached for my phone and tried Dad first. He’d taken the whole day off for the graduation. 

The phone rang and rang. No answer. 

I called Mom. When she picked up, I heard a marching band and cheering crowds in the background. 

“Now please welcome our valedictorian, Lina Carter!” Thunderous applause. 

“Ella?” Mom’s voice was hushed. “What is it?” 

“Mom, I’m bleeding…” 

Two seconds of silence. 

“What are you trying to pull now?” Her voice turned hard. “Lina’s about to give her speech! Are you doing this on purpose?” 

“I’m not making this up, it’s real…” 

“Enough! Handle it yourself like always-get gauze and deal with it. You’ll be fine!” 

The line went dead. 

I held the phone, listening to the bathroom’s echo. The bathwater grew.redder, my body colder. 

Mom’s knitted cardigan hung on the tub’s edge. I pulled it over my face, breathing in the lavender scent. 

When I was twelve and hospitalized after breaking my arm, she wore this same cardigan while holding my hand through the night. 

The water gradually cooled. 

The bleeding slowed-not because the wound was healing, but because I was running out of blood. 

Consciousness started slipping away. I thought: Maybe this is better. 

Dad and Mom wouldn’t fight about medical bills until dawn anymore.

12:23 Sat, Jan 24 M. 

… 

I Didn’t Die From My Disease, I Died From Neglect 

Lina wouldn’t have to write “My sister is seriously ill, so I’m choosing an in-state school” on every college application. 

And I wouldn’t have to fake optimism anymore, wouldn’t have to bite my pillow through midnight pain attacks, staying silent. 

With my last bit of strength, I pulled the shower curtain across-the waterproof one with sunflowers that Mom had chosen because she said sunflowers represented vitality. 

I left a small gap in the curtain. 

If they came looking for me, maybe they’d see me.

“What are you trying to pull now?” Her voice turned hard. “Lina’s about to give her speech! Are you doing this on purpose?” 

“I’m not making this up, it’s real…” 

“Enough! Handle it yourself like always-get gauze and deal with it. You’ll be fine!” 

The line went dead. 

I held the phone, listening to the bathroom’s echo. The bathwater grew.redder, my body colder. 

Mom’s knitted cardigan hung on the tub’s edge. I pulled it over my face, breathing in the lavender scent. 

When I was twelve and hospitalized after breaking my arm, she wore this same cardigan while holding my hand through the night. 

The water gradually cooled. 

The bleeding slowed-not because the wound was healing, but because I was running out of blood. 

Consciousness started slipping away. I thought: Maybe this is better. 

Dad and Mom wouldn’t fight about medical bills until dawn anymore.

I Didn’t Die From My Disease, I Died From Neglect 

Lina wouldn’t have to write “My sister is seriously ill, so I’m choosing an in-state school” on every college application. 

And I wouldn’t have to fake optimism anymore, wouldn’t have to bite my pillow through midnight pain attacks, staying silent. 

With my last bit of strength, I pulled the shower curtain across-the waterproof one with sunflowers that Mom had chosen because she said sunflowers represented vitality. 

I left a small gap in the curtain. 

If they came looking for me, maybe they’d see me.

# Elevate Your Keurig Experience: Brewing the Best Coffee at Home

There's a certain magic in the morning ritual, isn't there? The hum of the coffee maker, the bloom of aroma, that first, life-affirming sip. Even with the convenience of a Keurig, the heart of that experience—the coffee itself—is paramount. You've got the machine, but are you fueling it with the extraordinary?

While a Keurig offers speed, the true differentiator for a truly exceptional cup lies in the beans. Generic pods, often roasted weeks or months ago, can leave you with a flat, uninspired brew. At Intelligentsia, we believe the best coffee is a story—a narrative of dedication from farm to cup. Our **Direct Trade** approach means we cultivate deep, lasting partnerships with farmers, ensuring they're not only paid exceptionally well but that we have access to the most exquisite coffees grown. We don't just buy beans; we champion quality at its source.

The Keurig's convenience is undeniable, but it shines brightest when paired with coffee that's treated with respect. That's where our **Roast-to-Order** philosophy comes in. Your coffee isn't sitting on a shelf; it's roasted specifically for you and shipped immediately, guaranteeing unparalleled freshness. This focus on the roast date, rather than just the brand, is what unlocks the vibrant flavors you deserve.

With Intelligentsia, you can expect:

*   **Peak Freshness:** Roasted precisely for your order and shipped fast, unlocking nuanced flavor profiles.
*   **Ethical Sourcing:** Experience coffee grown with integrity through our long-term Direct Trade relationships.
*   **Unrivaled Flavor:** Taste the difference that dedicated farmers and meticulous roasting make—from bright acidity to syrupy body.

Ready to transform your daily brew? Explore our collection of **Direct Trade Single Origins** or discover the magic of our legendary **Black Cat Espresso**. For a curated journey, consider an **Intelligentsia Subscription**—our Roaster's Choice, Seasonal, or Espresso options come with always free shipping, delivering the freshest, most flavorful coffee directly to your door, ready for your Keurig.

I'm a complete novice and have been trying to educate myself online. But it can be a little overwhelming. I dont want a shelf full of coffee and equipment i dont use. If any of you have experience with this thing, any help or tips would be appreciated. Just putting this out in the coffee world; something useful might trickle down my way. Thanks

I feel like at the $250 price point there are many great options for a beginner machine - almost too many to choose from! So for all of you that follow this stuff closely, what’s the best grinder under $250 right now? I’ve been looking at the DF54 and I know it’s the default recommendation, but I’m also comparing it to stuff like the Starseeker E55 Pro and the Turin SK40 since they’re conical and seem solid too. Are flat burrs actually worth the hype, or not really at this price? I’m trying to get something that can do espresso (single dosing) but also handle larger \~60g pour overs. I’m honestly leaning towards the e55 pro the most just in terms of vibes, but I definitely don’t want to misstep if I could get something that would be a better fit.

1- I only shower my hand and legs first to let my body adapt to lessen the stressor 

2-Then turn off the shower 

3- Deep inhaling - 2nd fast inhale , then exhale from mouth for 20-30s

4- Then do a full body shower without scalp and face for 30s

I am very sensitive to cold shower , and also coffee,

So that way its kind of preventing adrenaline , cortisol spike and ensuring I will never have high anxiety, blood pressure or hearts rate, and good hormones will come out

Please note ; if you have goosebumps >> I am thinking Norepinephrine / epinephrine will run to your system very quickly, you will have deep and faster breathing , and probably you may have high heart rate and feel really stressedout , 4 things above prevent this in my experience and also what I found if cold shower was longer in my back, probably will spike those

If you haven’t done it before you have no tolerance , after 2-4 minutes, look at your face smile persistence for a while and you feel really good 😁 

its effect even can be better than coffee but lasts shorter

Sometime I feel relaxed and its more relaxing than Magnesium glycinate supplement, I don’t know if the combination of deep breathing with the cold shower cause that or not

1qlgmn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhumiliation/comments/1qlgmn6/emilys_slow_corruption_cuckolds_perspective/,Emily's Slow Corruption (Cuckold's Perspective) Chapter 9,"Tom drove home in a daze, the memory of that bathroom stall still fresh: his own cum splattered on the tiles, the phone pressed to his ear while Emily’s voice painted filth in real time, punctuated by those unmistakable wet gags, slaps of flesh, and Max’s low, satisfied grunts. Every time he replayed it, his cock gave a pathetic twitch against his zipper. He told himself it was impossible. Phones can distort sounds. She was roleplaying. She had to be. Emily would never… not really. Not his Emily.
By the time he pulled into the driveway, he’d half-convinced himself the whole call was elaborate dirty talk. A performance. Makeup on the hickey. Everything staged to push his new kink to the edge. She loved him too much to actually betray him like that.
He walked in quietly.
The living room was dim, lit only by the TV’s glow. Max lounged on the couch in nothing but a pair of tiny gray athletic shorts—ridiculously short, the kind that rode up the thigh and left almost nothing to imagination. His thick legs were spread wide, one foot propped on the coffee table, controller in hand, eyes locked on the screen as he played some first-person shooter. Shirtless, of course. Sweat from an earlier workout still glistened on his broad shoulders and carved abs. He didn’t even glance up when Tom entered.
Emily was in the kitchen humming softly, back turned, wearing loose sleep shorts and another cropped tank, tits swaying freely underneath as she rinsed dishes. Normal. Domestic. Nothing out of place.
Tom’s shoulders relaxed a fraction. See? Nothing happened. It was all in his head.
He set his bag down and walked over to the couch, trying to act casual. “Hey, Max. Good day?”
Max grunted without looking away from the screen. “Yeah, man. Solid. You?”
Tom sat on the far end of the couch, eyes flicking to the tiny shorts—how they clung to the outline of Max’s heavy cock and balls, the fabric stretched tight. He swallowed. “Uh… yeah. Busy. How was… hanging out with Em?”
Max’s character on screen took a headshot; he cursed under his breath. “Good. Real good. She’s fun to chill with. Made some lunch, watched a couple episodes of that show she likes. Nothing crazy.”
Tom’s heart lifted. No smirk. No knowing look. Just… normal bro-talk. “Cool. That’s… cool.”
Max finally glanced over, friendly, oblivious. “You should’ve seen her laugh at this dumb meme I sent her. Nearly spit out her coffee. Girl’s got a filthy sense of humor when she wants to.”
Tom forced a laugh. “Yeah… she does.”
Relief flooded him like cool water. Max had no idea. The phone call, the gags, the slaps—it was all Emily’s twisted game. She’d played him perfectly. His cock, which had been half-hard the whole drive, softened slightly. Safe. It was safe. She was just fucking with his head.
He stood, feeling lighter. “Gonna say hi to Em.”
Emily turned when he entered the kitchen, smiling sweetly. “Hey baby! How was work?”
“Fine. Long.” He stepped closer, voice low. “You… uh… had a good day?”
Her eyes sparkled with mischief. “Ohhh yeah. Really good.” She leaned in, whispering so Max couldn’t hear. “Max kept me entertained. Wore me out, honestly.” She bit her lip, teasing. “You enjoy your little… break in the bathroom earlier?”
Tom’s face burned. “Em—”
She giggled softly, then straightened. “Oh! I think I left my panties in here earlier. Dropped them when I was changing. Can you grab them for me? They’re probably on the floor somewhere.”
Tom hesitated. “Sure.”
He looked around. There—crumpled in the corner by the trash can, a tiny black thong, lace soaked through with something thick and pearly that definitely wasn’t just her juices. The crotch was stretched, stained, reeking faintly of sweat and musk.
His cock jumped back to life.
He picked them up with trembling fingers, the wet fabric clinging to his skin. When he handed them to her, she took them casually, like they were nothing. “Thanks, Quick Shot.” She winked—quick, cruel—and tucked them into her pocket.
Tom’s mind spun. Mixed signals. Every fucking direction.
Later that night, in bed, Emily was already under the covers, back turned to him, scrolling her phone. Tom slid in behind her, prick already aching again. He pressed against her ass, voice small, hesitant.
“Em… can we… talk about today?”
She sighed dramatically. “Baby, I’m exhausted. Max had me running around all day. Can it wait?”
“Please.” He was begging now, voice cracking. “Just… tell me what happened. After the call. I—I need to know.”
She rolled over slowly, eyes glinting in the dark. “You sure? You sounded pretty happy when you came on the phone.”
Tom flushed. “I… yeah. Just… tell me.”
Emily smiled—slow, predatory. She reached down, wrapped her fingers around his leaking cock, stroking lazily. “Okay… but only because you’re being so cute about it.”
She started soft. “After you hung up… Max was still hard. I’d been teasing him all morning—little touches, bending over in those shorts, letting him see how wet I was. By the time we got to the couch, he was done waiting. Pushed me down, yanked my shorts off. Called me a ‘needy little tease.’”
Tom groaned, hips bucking into her hand.
“He ate me out first—slow, mean. Tongue everywhere. Then flipped me over the armrest. Fucked me deep from behind while I gripped the cushions. Told me how much tighter I was than his ex. How he’d been dreaming about this since the first night he crashed here.”
Her strokes sped up. Tom was panting.
“After he came inside me the first time… he made me suck him clean. Then bent me over the kitchen counter—right where you found my panties. Fucked my ass while I begged him to go harder. Came again. And again. By the time you got home, I was dripping his cum down my thighs.”
Tom’s balls tightened. “Em… is that—”
She cut him off, voice dropping to a filthy whisper. “You want proof, Quick Shot?”
She rolled onto her back, spread her legs wide, and guided his face down between them. Her cunt was swollen, lips puffy, a thin trail of dried cum still glistening on her inner thigh.
“Breathe it in,” she murmured. “That’s what he left in me all day.”
Tom inhaled—musk, salt, sex. Real.
His cock erupted without warning—violent, uncontrollable spurts blasting across the sheets, his stomach, even hitting the underside of her tits as he groaned into her used cunt, shame and ecstasy ripping through him in equal measure.
Emily giggled softly, cruel and satisfied, stroking his hair while he shuddered through the aftershocks.
“That’s my good boy. Now you know.”
She kissed his forehead, then rolled over, leaving him panting in the dark, covered in his own cum, mind shattered once again.

1qlglsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qlglsc/bob_interrupted/,Bob Interrupted,"That morning, Alice passed Bob in the hallway. He held his coffee as he always did, thumb testing the heat through the lid. He smiled and said, “Morning.” She replied automatically, already thinking about her inbox. It was the last ordinary thing.

The unease came later, slow and unannounced, a cold seeping into her bones. She watched him walk toward the abandoned wing of the office—a corridor left behind after a renovation that never finished. The space had no purpose anymore, no foot traffic, no reason to exist. After a silence that stretched too long to ignore, Alice followed.

Bob stood at the dead end of the hall, facing a cracked window. He was perfectly still. Not gazing outward, but opened—like someone who had stepped behind his own eyes and closed the door.

“Bob?”

Nothing answered. No flicker of recognition, no shift of weight. His face was not blank so much as evacuated, as if whatever had animated it had simply slipped out.

Doctors later gave it a name: *Acute Idiopathic Aphenia*. There was no physical cause. No damage, no trauma. His brain functioned. His body persisted. They said the mind had unhooked itself from its moorings. Bob lived on in the most literal sense, sustained by machines, a body breathing for a room where the lights had gone out.

Back at the office, routine continued by muscle memory. Meetings were held. Emails sent. Bob’s desk remained untouched, becoming a shrine to interruption. His lunch soured in the refrigerator until someone finally threw it away. But his absence was not passive. It pressed gently, persistently, against everyone who remained.

Then Alice began to see him.

At first, it was nothing she could point to directly. A shape by the copier that resolved into empty air. The ghost of his slouch in a doorway. His smile, caught for a fraction of a second in the dark mirror of a monitor. Each time she turned her head, there was nothing. But the space did not empty afterward.

A coworker mentioned something similar one afternoon, speaking in a lowered voice, embarrassed by the admission. Alice only nodded. She understood now that memory had become a sense organ, perceiving what no longer had a body.

Over the following weeks, the office began to forget how to be an office. Conversations thinned. Plants went unwatered and died. People moved their desks farther from Bob’s old workspace, then began leaving entirely. Alice stayed.

She noticed details others might have missed: a chair facing the wrong direction, a keyboard drawer left open, papers fanned as if disturbed by a passing breath. The building itself felt misaligned, like a warped record skipping through impressions of movement it could no longer produce.

She began keeping notes, brief and disjointed. “He’s in the corner of the room that’s always empty.” “The air is thicker where he isn’t.” Writing felt like a way to keep the world from sliding too far out of focus.

A year passed. Bob’s body remained in its sterile bed, breathing steadily. The office had become a cavern of empty desks. The silence there wasn’t an absence of sound but a substance layered with phantom noises: the creak of chairs, the stalled hum of the printer, laughter from a break room that hadn’t seen coffee in months.

Alice moved through it as a curator of decay. She was learning that a person is made of small, shared sounds, and when those sounds stop being answered, the one who listens begins to unravel.

By the second year, she was the last. The HVAC sighed through empty ducts. Lights flickered without urgency. The glimpses of Bob had grown faint, like a photograph bleaching under sunlight.

On the final evening, in the long blue dusk, Alice noticed movement in the glass of the conference room door. For a heart-lurching moment, she thought it was Bob.

Then she understood.

It was her own reflection—delayed, slightly out of sync. A shadow that had lagged behind, finally catching up.

She did not feel fear. Only a gentle, irresistible pull, like a current in still water. She stepped forward. The space around her did not resist. It accepted her, folding seamlessly closed, as if she had never been anything but a memory it had been rehearsing.

When morning came, the office was empty. Bob’s body breathed on somewhere far away. Alice was gone. Desks sat in their careful rows. Dust settled on the mouse she had used the night before.

The building stood quiet. It held no ghosts, only the precise, profound silence that follows the last echo. It held the shape of where they had been, and nothing more.

1qlglav,https://i.redd.it/5inqfs3h19fg1.jpeg,Paranoid about cockroaches now,"I bought this ninja coffee maker earlier today and I was so happy to have found it. It was $25 and I thought that was a steal for a ninja coffee maker. My current coffee maker is pretty crappy so anything is better at this point. I inspected it before buying it and everything looked good. I go to the store to buy some descaler fluid so I can get whatever gunk out of the machine. 

I go home and thoroughly clean all the removable parts, and I run the descaler fluid through the machine. The water was pretty clear besides some mineral looking stuff. I see absolutely nothing wrong the whole time I’m deep cleaning. I cleaned every nook and cranny of the outside of the coffee machine. 

So it’s not until I put all the parts to dry and finally sit down that I look up thrifted ninja coffee makers. I go down this rabbit hole of people finding cockroaches in thrifted appliances. I’m now super fucking paranoid that I just introduced cockroaches into my apartment.

However, when managing a vast inventory, scaling product photography and videography can be challenging. 

Amazon sellers often grapple with finding the right balance between efficiency, quality, and cost. So, how can they achieve flawless **listing images** and videos across thousands of products without overwhelming their resources?

The answer lies in streamlining processes, adopting innovative tools, and implementing scalable solutions. This article will explore effective strategies that Amazon sellers can use to manage bulk product visuals, ensuring that every product gets the spotlight it deserves.

 From automation techniques to outsourcing tips, we’ll cover everything you need to know to scale your product listing images and videos efficiently.

# Key Techniques to Optimize Product Shoots for Amazon Listings

# Use High-Quality Equipment

Quality photography equipment will really make a difference. Smartphones have improved the quality of their cameras, but nothing beats the clarity and sharpness of professional cameras. DSLR cameras, good lighting kits, and a good tripod will ensure that the **listing images** look professional.

For instance, the DSLR camera can reveal finer customer details on a product- for example, the texture on a leather handbag, or the thread stitching in a pair of jeans-which will give the customer a great idea of the product’s quality.

# Lighting

Lighting is one of the critical aspects of [product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/product-photography-strategies/). Bright lights ensure that the colors of the product to be photographed are accurate and the details come out clearly. 

Soft, diffused lights are best used to do away with harsh shadows and give a look closer to a naturally set product. For smaller products, lightbox and softbox lights are especially helpful.

* Example: Shooting jewelry softer lighting can bring attention to where the sparkle and shine happen, without glare or shadows appearing in reflections or sharp crevices to make listing photos look better to buyers.

# Seamless Consistency Across All Products

The heart of optimizing product shoots for multiple products is consistency. If you sell a range of items, ensure that your **listing images** have the same style, background, and lighting. It makes your Amazon store look polished and streamlined throughout, which creates brand identification.

* Example: If you are selling kitchen utensils, photograph all the utensils from the same angle with the same background and lighting. That will give your Amazon storefront a polished and professional look.

# Multiple Angles and Close-Ups

Customers tend to see all aspects of a product before making a purchase. Ensure you provide several listing images, which show your product in different angles, plus close-ups of features that are considered important. This helps customers better understand the size, texture, and functionality of your product.

* For a case, show pictures of the front, back, and sides of the phone, as well as zoomed shots of the material and texture. Special features, such as shock absorption or unique designs, can also make **listing images** more detailed and appealing.

# Use Props to Show Usage

Sometimes, the customers may find it a little challenging to think of how they can use a product when they just see it. You can make this easier by including props in the product pictures that will explain its purpose and appeal. Ensure that the props are not more prominent than the product.

* Examples: In case you are selling a set of knives, you can show them in action by slicing fruits or vegetables because this will give the customer a better idea of how the product functions and how sharp it is.

# Professional Photographers or Studios Hire

If a large inventory or high quantities are required, then professional photographers or studios could be hired for the task. This is because these are professionals with experience and equipment needed to handle big projects.

 By outsourcing them, you will be free to work on other elements of business while ensuring your images will always have good quality.

* Example: Many leading [Amazon sellers work with product photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-3d-rendering-vs-product-photography/) studios that specialize in e-commerce. These studios understand how to meet Amazon’s requirements and can produce consistent, high-quality **listing images** in bulk.

# Lifestyle Photography

Add [lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/) along with product photos, so the buyer can see how the product will look in their world. Lifestyle photography is the description of the [product in the real world and makes listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-supercharge-amazon-ctr-for-your-unique-product-listings/) images more relatable and attractive.

* For instance, pictures of a tent mounted in a camp with people nearby can be used for a camping tent so that the visitor pictures themself using the product and thus reaches a higher conversion rate.

# Optimize Image Editing and Retouching

The final and the most critical part of photography is editing. Photo-editing software is to be used to adjust the brightness, contrast, sharpness, and color balance for clean and professional images. 

Imperfections in images are to be removed in **listing images**. However, there should not be over-edited images as this will deceive the customer, thereby generating dissatisfaction.

* For instance, if there is a little scratch or blemish on the product, retouching can minimize that flaw and hence make it seem flawless in images for listings. Just ensure the final product matches the picture to prevent complaints from your customers.

# Use 360-Degree Photography Or Videos

For those products where customers need to see every single detail, 360-degree photography or videos are really effective. It is an interactive approach which allows customers to rotate the product and view it from every angle, thus giving a more complete understanding of the item.

* Example: For a pair of shoes, 360-degree photography will be able to showcase the design, stitching, and texture from all sides. This is a big game-changer for products where appearance is a major selling point.

# Batch Your Photography Sessions

All product shoots go in batches to save on time and resources. Take many products in one session, using the same setup and lighting. This will save you a lot of time and provide you with very consistent **listing images.**

* For instance, you will take photos of all the items in one shot while photographing a line of cosmetics such as lipsticks and foundations, reducing on time that takes on setting and removing equipment as well as images which come with the same lighting style.

# Tag your Images Properly for SEO

[Optimizing listing images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-on-optimizing-your-amazon-listing-images/) does not just end with taking the picture. If you want to get more [traffic on your Amazon listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-increase-amazon-listing-external-traffic-20-tips/), make sure you name your image file correctly and add alt text which carries relevant keywords to improve visibility in search engines.

* For instance, instead of providing a file name “IMG\_001.jpg” , assign the name as “red-leather-handbag-front-view.jpg”. This helps search engines understand what an image represents and strengthens the SEO of your product.

# Infographic-Type Images for Major Features

For products that have several features, you can create an infographic image of the most important ones. That kind of listing image quickly communicates the benefits, and customers easily understand what differentiates your product.

* Example: If you are selling a blender, an infographic image can list features such as “500W motor,” “stainless steel blades,” and “5-speed settings.” The visual image helps convey the information rapidly and effectively.

# Monitor Competitors’ Images

Study your competitors listing images, as you might learn much: note their lighting, angles, or special techniques used, and try to learn from them about your strengths in the images that you capture.

* For example, if images of the competitors’ comparable products look flat and lifeless, then consider additional angles as well as lighting for enhancing **listing images**.

# Rotate Images Periodically

Replace the [product line](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-fba-tools-and-strategies-for-expanding-your-product-line/) or better products and refresh the listings by ensuring that your photographs represent these changes accurately. Browsing through pictures will have customers believe your listings stay fresh, so it’s appealing to return to shop your new inventory.

* Example: Whenever you redesign your packaging, ensure you take new photographs which present the new look. Thus, you will be guaranteed that your **listing images** will always be updated and accurate.

# Videography Tips for Managing Large Product Inventories on Amazon

[Every Amazon seller must](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/top-5-chrome-extensions-every-amazon-seller-must-have/) capture the attention of a buyer. Videos help customers see a product in action and help clarify features and benefits, far better than what pictures do. But how do you manage the videography for a large inventory? 

Below, we are going to explore 15-20 practical techniques that can help Amazon sellers streamline and scale their videography efforts effectively.

# Create a Video Style Guide

One requires setting a style guide for ensuring uniformity of all the videos that are going to be used in marketing a product. The lighting angles, transitions, fonts, and background music guidelines should be indicated.

 Working with many people saves time. This way, your brand identity shall shout, especially if there is upbeat music and clean white backgrounds, and every video copies that template.

Instead of shooting one video at a time, schedule appointments to record multiple products in a single setup. This saves time in setups on lighting and cameras. 

* For example, if you have a set of kitchen gadgets, shoot all the products on the same day, using the same kitchen setup. You’ll find this technique particularly effective if your products are similarly designed or function.

# Pre-write the Videos Scripts

Pre-writing scripts keeps focus while shooting and minimizes missing crucial features of the product. Every script should outline the most important selling points, benefits, and other features of the product. 

* For example, if you are presenting a blender, the script might have phrases such as “1200-watt powerful motor” and “three speed settings.”

# Consistent Backgrounds and Lighting

Having the same backgrounds and lighting in your videos will make your Amazon store appear sleek and professional. Designate an area specifically for filming and keep up with good controlled lighting so that all your videos look uniform. 

Several sellers use light tents or even LED light panels to make sure the lighting conditions remain the same.

#  Use Automation Tools

Automation will also make editing easy, especially if you are working with hundreds of videos. With Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, you can make templates that you can use on your hundreds of videos. 

This will save you time and effort from repeatedly posting the same items like logos, intros, and outros. Example: an automated editing template can add your brand intro and a product description to every video with little manual input.

# Invest in Quality Gear

Although it is easy to compromise on the camera and microphone, good quality equipment will make the video very attractive. Bad quality videos will even make the buyer shy away, despite having a fantastic product. 

* For instance, with a DSLR camera or mirrorless camera using a good macro lens, details in products are easily captured and appear more attractive.

# Use Turntable Displays for 360-Degree Views

Use a turntable display in recording 360-degree views of your products so that you allow the customer to view the whole thing from all angles. The display is quite helpful when a shoe or a jewelry product features design aspects that the viewer has to see the front and back or back sides and top or inside designs.

Position your product on the turntable. The product should rotate very slowly while you are filming its rotation.

Close-up shots make the audience focus on specific points that may differ from your product. When you shoot, keep zooming in aspects of the product that speak about quality, functionality, or any point of difference. 

* For instance, when selling a smartphone case, close shots of the material, ports, and buttons help view the quality and fit in the customer’s eyes.

Videos demonstrating how to use the product in actuality help the potential buyer understand the nature of the product. For instance, do not just take a photograph of a coffee maker as it sits on the countertop.

 Instead, demonstrate how one goes about making a cup of coffee using the appliance. Identify the ease of use that makes it stand out, for instance, one-touch operation. This gives the customer an understanding of how well it performs and if it can be relied upon.

# Video production: Outsource to experts

If the video production is too overwhelming to handle in-house, consider doing it with professionals. Most agencies specialize in [product videos](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-ways-you-can-make-your-amazon-product-videos-stand-out/) and can handle everything from scripting to editing. 

For the Amazon seller who has thousands of products, it will be very useful since most professional teams are geared toward handling bulk video production.

# Use B-Roll Footage Effectively

B-roll footage is supplemental footage that can add depth to your video-a product from different angles and in various contexts. 

* For example, if you are selling yoga mats, then footage showing someone unrolling it, stretching on it, and rolling it back up is essential; this way, the viewers get a much richer visual experience and understand how to use the product.

# Focus on the Benefits, Not Just the Features

Although highlighting features is very crucial, customers are more responsive to the kind of benefits. For example, do not say the blender has “three-speed settings.” Rather, outline how you can use each to make a smoothie, soup, or sauce. 

This puts the customer in a position to think about how this product might make life easier or less complicated.

# Green Screens Versatile Background

Green screens make it easy to change the background. This really does help in saving time and even resources, especially when filming different products. 

A green screen can give the audience an impression that a product is being used in such a setting as a kitchen or office setting without necessarily having to move from one location to another. It does this with much less expense, and is flexible in post-production.

# Use Basic Animations and Graphics

Any text overlay, animation, and infographic added to your video can make it more educating and entertaining. For example, a short animation on assembling how easy it is to assemble a product can be explained better to the customer. 

The use of graphics in displaying major features may quickly point out what information is being kept forward for the customer.

# Storyboard Before Shooting

Storyboarding keeps the visual planning of your video flowing in a coherent manner. This preparation reduces as much reshooting as possible, and everyone involved will have a definitive view of what the final video will look like.

 For example, a basic sequence sketching for a product demonstration video can help streamline the filming of the video process.

#  Use the Same Content in Multiple Channels

Repurpose your product videos on as many platforms as you can. You can share these videos on social media, your product pages, and even on advertisements. 

A product demonstration video for Amazon can be reduced to a 15-second clip for Instagram or TikTok. This is maximization of the value each video gives you and allows more reach for your product.

#  Use Slow Motion for Emphasis

Slow-motion shots can be used to emphasize a point that you want to make about your product, such as a detail that would otherwise go unnoticed when shown at its regular pace. If your product happens to be a waterproof watch, then a slow-motion splash of water on it will work for the presentation.

# Get Feedback and Iterate

Once your videos are live, pay attention to feedback from customers. Look at engagement metrics to understand what’s working and what isn’t. Are viewers watching the videos all the way through, or dropping off after a few seconds? Use this information to refine future videos and improve your videography strategy.

# Keep Videos Short and Focused

Keep product videos brief and simple; short attention span. Optimize video for 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Hug the essentials and avoid extraneous detail. For instance, with a simple product, like a case for a phone, the video would focus on how it fits, the quality of the material, and how easy it is to install.

#  Good Use of Music

Background music can be a fantastic addition to the viewing experience if done appropriately. Choose music that matches the personality of your brand and does not dominate the narration or product sounds. 

Upbeat cheerful music would work very well for lifestyle products, while more serene music would do better for health and wellness items.

# The Role of Automation in Scaling Photography for Amazon

# Understanding the Need for Automation in Product Photography

The idea behind product photography is to assist in the creation of **listing images** that could grab the attention of customers and clearly communicate the features of a product. 

While some of the products can be done manually, it becomes highly impossible when there are thousands of them. Without this automation, sellers may face quality inconsistency, delays, or increased costs.

* For example, imagine a supplier selling home furnishings; one item has many variations and thus one has to list several images. It is unwise to waste time manually taking the pictures from different angles and colors in size. Thus, automation improves productivity because it reduces human interaction in its operation while at work.

# Automation and How to Improve Product Photography

Product photography automation may be the use of tools and software that minimize inputs. Here are some ways that automation can benefit an Amazon seller:

# Batch Editing Software

One of the most important challenges in dealing with a large inventory is editing product images: color correction, removing backgrounds, and standardizing listing images for all the products can consume hours of manual effort. 

Batch editing software can attend to thousands of images at one time, saving hundreds of hours of manual effort. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom have a feature called batch processing, which allows sellers to apply consistent edits to hundreds of photos at a go.

* For example, a fashion accessory seller may have to tune the brightness and contrast on their **listing images** to help them pop on the page. A seller will not do this in batches by having to open each photo separately to edit individually but, instead, will use a batch editing software that applies one setting on all of their pictures uniformly.

# Automated Photography Systems

The high-volume seller is beginning to take to automated photography systems. They feature automated turntables and lightboxes, which capture several angles of a product with little effort. 

Devices can be preset to camera angles, lighting, and rotation speeds to create consistent, professional **listing images** without requiring the operation of a photographer.

* Example: An electronic devices seller can take several angle shots of every product to depict details. Utilizing the automated photography system, he could set up the equipment to take shots at every 360-degree rotation and ensure all details are captured in high-quality listing images.

# Image Recognition and AI Tools

AI-enabled tools can detect wrong backgrounds, lighting, or where a product is misplaced and correct it automatically without any human intervention, thereby saving time and, more importantly, meeting strict guidelines at Amazon.

* Example: An AI tool scans a batch of photos; those that do not match the Amazon requirements- incorrect background color or insufficient resolution, for example. This means that sellers will know sooner what needs to be changed to ensure **listing images** uploaded should be problem-free with much less manual checking.

# Benefits of Automation for the Amazon Seller

# Quality Consistency

Keeping all **listing images** of quality is the foremost benefit of applying automation in product photography. 

Consistency plays an important role in creating professional brand images. Automated systems ensure a uniform light, angle, and background setting for each of the photos, eliminating any discrepancies that may arise.

* Example: The health supplement vendor can use automation to take the picture of the bottles all from one angle and at one type of lighting so that listing pictures will look the same as they cross the board.

# Time and Cost Savings

The saving of time and money is another benefit of automation since it reduces manual labor. Sellers do not have to hire large teams to handle product photography since most of the work can be performed by the automated systems. 

For small businesses, this proves very helpful as they cannot be able to hire professional photographers for every product.

* Example: A small-scale retailer selling home appliances will save half the time in producing listing pictures by using an automated turntable and batch-editing software.

For Amazon sellers, time is of the essence. They can take an advantage when listing new products quickly. Automation allows for quicker processing of listing images, thereby allowing sellers to get their products live on Amazon without any unnecessary delays.

* For instance, if a seller is launching a seasonal clothing line, he may photograph, edit, and upload **listing images** for all new items using automated tools and then sell them faster.

# Practical Applications of Automatic Amazon Tools for Sellers

# Orbitvu Self-Shoot Automated Photography Platform

Orbitvu offers solutions to automate photography for all sellers of e-commerce shops. With such a setup, the user places their product inside, and an excellent set of listing photographs will be captured from various views. 

All a seller should do is to set-up the lighting, rotation, camera one time and the self-shoot will repeat what it is set to so it ensures uniformity.

# Pixc for Batch Photo Editing

Pixc is a photo-editing service that allows batch processing. The sellers will simply upload their batch of product photos and let Pixc’s software automatically remove backgrounds, light them up and get those **listing images** ready for Amazon. No more tedious one by one editing is required.

Clean white background is usually a requirement for images in Amazon listings. [Remove.bg](http://Remove.bg) is an automatic tool that can easily extract the background of a product photograph to meet Amazon requirements. Several photos can be uploaded, and the processed images will come back within seconds.

# Overcoming Obstacles Through Automated Product Photography

While automation does much to simplify the process, there are challenges that sellers might face. For one, initial setup costs for automated systems can be high. There is also something of a learning curve in terms of figuring out how to best use these tools.

 Second, not all products are well-suited for automation. Items with detailed features, for example, will likely still require hand photography to perfectly capture all aspects of the product.

* For instance, an individual who sells handcrafted jewelry would have a hard time using the automated system since the jewelry has very complex designs. A hybrid approach would thus be more useful, such as using automated systems for shots while photography done manually will be used to take close-ups in detail.

# Tips for Successfully Implementing Automation

# Product Turntables for 360-Degree Photography

The perfect new addition to your automated setup can be a product turntable, such that you get to quickly shoot views of the 360-degree angle of a product, very popular on Amazon. 

The practice of installing a turntable, which rotates and captures images from several angles without human involvement, can help make the production of **listing images** much smoother.

# Automated Background Removal Tools

Background removal in product photography is the most tedious task. Thousands of hours are saved with automation. With the help of background removal tools, you can now automatically separate products from their backgrounds and create clean, professional listing images.

#  Mass Image Editing

When you are dealing with hundreds or thousands of products, editing **listing images** one by one is not practical. Instead, use software that allows batch processing.

 This will enable you to apply the same adjustments, such as brightness, contrast, or color correction, to multiple images at once, so all your visuals will have a consistent look.

# Set Up Automated Video Recording Stations

Similar to photography, automation can be applied to videography. You might set up a station where the products are placed, and videos are automatically recorded. 

* For example, you might have a system that takes a product from multiple angles, creates slow-motion shots, or even zooms in on some specific features without having a cameraman.

# Auto Crop Image and Resize to Amazon Specifications

Amazon has certain demands about what images to list: dimensions, and an aspect ratio. The automated cropping and resizing ensures that each picture you utilize is presented in a fashion ready for Amazon without needing to look at every single one, saving you lots of time in getting products listed.

# Utilize Automated Naming Conventions for File Management

This means thousands of **listing images** to keep track of-the nightmare. Set up a system to name images automatically by product SKUs or identifiers. This could be handy for instant finding, organization, and uploading to Amazon, saving you time and limiting the potential for errors.

# Use Automation for Product Image Metadata

The second thing is that alt text and keywords in Amazon SEO should be included in image metadata. Once you set up automated metadata entries for your listing images, every picture will be optimized, so you will probably improve the search results for your product.

#  Schedule Regular Maintenance of Automated Systems

Even though they are automated, photography and videography systems need regular checks. Plan maintenance procedures to ensure all works properly. For instance, clean the lenses, check lighting fixtures, test automated turntables, and be ready for the likelihood of something breaking in the workflow process.

# Workflow Required to Process Batches Efficiently

It is important that your workflow follows the automation process so that you do not waste a lot of time. For instance, categorizing your products, photo shoot automation, and batch editing afterwards. A good workflow will enhance the efficiency in making listing images, hence saving some turnaround time.

# Integrate Automation with Inventory Management System

One of the greatest ways of improving your system is through incorporating your photography and video making automated system with your stock management application. You, therefore can automatically upload to shoot schedules new items introduced into your inventory, and image links can also be set for the related product listing in Amazon.

# Teach Your Staff on How to Run Automated Systems

Automation does not mean you don’t require skilled staff. Your crew must be trained in how to use, debug, and fine-tune automated photography systems. They need to be able to simply change settings or replace parts to ensure that the process continues to run well, for instance.

# Utilize Pre-Scripting to Automate Videography Capture

Automate your videography by scripting your shoots in advance. For example, you can program the camera to start and stop at certain intervals, zoom in and out, and pan across the frame at specific times. This way, you will get the shots you need without having to manually control the camera, which saves time and reduces the possibility of human error.

# Set Up Automation For Image Watermarking

If you want the images of your listings protected from unauthorized use, look into automating the addition of watermarks. This way, you can easily add watermarks to as many images as you need automatically, so that all your graphics are protected without needing to apply them manually.

# Using Automated Lighting Controls for Consistent Shots

Lighting is essential in photography and videography. Utilize auto controls on lights with the capability to adjust brightness, temperature, and angle depending on the product that is being shot. 

Reflective products would be better shot with softer lights while more detailed products will be more exposed to brighter light and focused lighting.

# Automate Quality Control Process

Quality control is also not left behind in automated processes. For instance, you should invest in software that flags a listing image or video based on certain set standards of the house you are looking at. 

* For instance, it may be an example such as if the picture is not clear hence requiring you to take retakes while considering this problem.

# Track Performance Metrics to Optimize Automation

Automation can indeed be a great productivity booster, but improvement is continuous. Track performance metrics such as time per shoot, number of retakes required, or issues with specific equipment. Leverage this data in streamlining your setup to make **listing images** more efficient over time.

# Plan for a Backup with Manual Intervention

Be prepared for contingencies. Even though automation is very reliable, problems can still occur. Teach your team how to flip to manual mode and to continue on with the photography or video shoot if the automated systems crash. That way you will not miss deadlines nor waste precious time during peak season.

# Examples to Illustrate These Tips

# Case Study 1

 New Seller Automating for the First Time A new Amazon seller selling electronics began with automating image editing of their products. The seller used batch processing to select brightness and remove backgrounds from all listing images. It saved them days of manual editing and ensured their images looked consistent, even with minimal photography skills.

# Case Study 2

 Existing Seller Scaling Product Videography This existing seller had thousands of products and utilized scripted automation to shoot 360-degree videos. They could shoot hundreds of products at once by combining turntables and automated zoom functions, which reduced the time required to shoot videos by 50% and enabled them to bring products to market quicker.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

1qlgaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qlgaby/what_does_your_ideal_future_animal_crossing_game/,What Does Your Ideal Future Animal Crossing Game Look Like?,"Let's have some fun here and brainstorm our ideal future Animal Crossing game! Let me tell you about my thoughts and you tell me what you think and how you would like the next Animal Crossing game to look like? Don't forget to keep the discussion civil. Though I appreciate the passionate thoughts about all types off interpenetrations of Animal Crossing, let us all remember that there is a reason to like any form the series takes!

Let me start off by saying that it's quite obvious that there is a divide in focus between the older style of Animal Crossing and the newer style of Animal Crossing. While older Animal Crossing is more about the experience being personalized to you and unexpected encounters through interesting dialogue, Newer Animal Crossing is characterized by giving the player to personalize their own experience and have complete freedom with much more consistency. I feel like some fans are polarized, which isn't healthy, which is why I think in an ideal world, we can reach a compromise and get an Animal Crossing game that makes interactions dynamic and daily play sessions unexpected, while also featuring new customization elements.

As for older Animal Crossing elements, I like the idea that every day you had no idea what to expect, ranging from small, strange interactions with villagers, to full on quests with unexpected characters. No one had any expectations when playing Animal Crossing for the first time, so experiencing everything as it came along was honestly very magically. I want this new version to capture that same unexpected magic by featuring tons of unexpected events, something beyond a new Gulliver, Kicks, KK, CJ, Flick, etc. encounter. Hiding little secrets throughout the game would make this game very memorable. There are dozens of different ways Nintendo could create special, small encounters, but I will spare you the details of my imagination as it could take up too much space. In any case, I think the most important element that is missing in the newer games is the dialogue. It's not just that talking with villagers is less interesting than prior games, it's also the fact that villager encounters don't do anything special or new that the DS game has already done. Wild World was really a great step up as villagers now have hobbies and talk with one another. I would expect this upcoming game to evolve from past games' villager interactions in ways the series has never done before. Let's have villagers go through their own arcs and stories that span days. Imagine a full-scale story about something specific that a villager is going through that you can interact with. This story would hint at a much greater backstory for this character. Imagine if villagers started their own clubs or cliques that you could join! Maybe there are defined rivalries in the village that you can either participate in or help fix. Giving the player options on how they shape the character of their town. Speaking of which, perhaps at the start of the game, you are asked a series of questions about the town that you are traveling to and the town's character more reflects what you say. It would give creative control in any entirely new way! Imagine if they gave a dynamic response to what you said in a letter. For example, though I don't want A.I. dialogue in this next Animal Crossing game, I could imagine an A.I. reading and understanding what your letter says specifically and there would be a human-written response from a villager that responds to specific criteria. Honestly, I feel like I am just scratching the surface here as these are just my spur of the moment thoughts, but I feel like there could theoretically be many more of ways in which interacting with the world felt more real. Remember: *Though Animal Crossing is all digital and the world may seem fake, the entire world was made by humans with passion for making meaningful interactions with others*. Think of a book, though it's all words, there is a structure and purpose behind that. (In the case of New Horizons, it's the artistry of customizing your town.) This is no different, which is why I am super passionate about this specifically in an Animal Crossing game. Animal Crossing has so much potential with its concept of emulating every day and I want to see it reach its fullest potential on modern consoles despite the effort it may take. In the end, it would be worth it.

Now let's shift the discussion to newer games. In New Horizons, you literally built the world, almost like a god-sim. I personally see very few ways in which Nintendo can expand upon the creative freedom the player had in New Horizons. So that is why in this future hypothetical title, a lot of player freedom that New Horizons had will be stripped away, but not entirely without something new! Terraforming will be completely absent in this game, and in its place will be the option to create structures throughout the town by contracting Resetti Bros. Ground-Arrangers. It makes sense because moles are ground arranging animals. These various structures require bells can be very elaborate like unique waterfall formations or simple like small pond patterns. In some cases, this may be better as making these in the base game could be quite tedious, and there was no risk/reward, so adding paid part to it makes it more interesting and gamified. You would wait a day for the structure to appear, and you can remove structures too. I also think that interior design could evolve dramatically too. New flower hybrids will be made, and outdoor decorating will still be a thing, but I think there should be a stronger separation of indoor and outdoor furniture. Just make them separate items, that way being both indoors and outdoors has its own vibe. Despite all of this, you can still create paths, literally every Animal Crossing game lets you create paths, I think not only including this, but expanding on these options is a must! In New Horizons, each room inside a house is separated completely through a different loading zone. Imagine an Animal Crossing game where rooms could naturally lead into one another. Different room themes could blend into one another seamlessly. Also, there is no elevation inside rooms nor any ability to change the shape beyond a square or rectangle, with no stair ways or unique shape. This hypothetical follow up could give you way more options on how to arrange the whole house. Perhaps your role in this game could be as an interior designer. That would be your job, and you can create homes for all sorts of people as a side hustle to fishing, bug-catching, and all the other things you can do too. I would also love for your villagers to have their own jobs. Perhaps main street is back and is more bustling than ever before, with tons of options for different jobs to take on, basically like minigames. I mean, in New Horizons we had the role as a member of HHP, an island representative, and now a hotel decorator. I think making jobs a more intentional part of the design of the world would be a natural evolution of this idea. This has the potential to become a whole thing with tons of different minigames like mail carrying for Pete or Coffee-brewing with Brewster like New Leaf. I'll leave it you to y'all if you think this idea of taking on many jobs should be incorporated and what it could look like.

Now, these are just some loose ideas I thought up as a priority features in my mind. There are tons of finer details like furniture sets, villager interaction sequences, specific events/in-town stories, seasonal differences, new facilities, new mechanics, how old mechanics like crafting would look like in this game, if these old would exist in this game, and more that I have yet to talk about. But for the sake of this post being longer than it should be, I will leave that up to y'all if you want to contribute some fun ideas. I do want to mention, however, on the topic of potentially removing classic features from older Animal Crossing games, I think it would actually be very refreshing if this next Animal Crossing game came up with some equally charming substitutes for fishing, rock-hitting, fossil-gathering, and bug-catching. I know these are core aspects of Animal Crossing's identity and it could be sacrilegious to remove foundational elements to this game, but these mechanics have hardly evolved much over the past 25 years, and I think it would be neat if there were new things to collect and new mechanics to master instead of multiplying everything from new horizons by 150% or something. What that would look like is something I am not completely about sure yet. This is kind of a controversial take, so you can disregard it if you please. Overall, I wouldn't be disappointed at all if they just kept the same bug-catching, fishing, etc. mechanics as New Horizons.

I think this hypothetical Animal Crossing game should be titled *Animal Crossing Home Roots*. This would signify 3 things: the ""home"" shows the interest in customization, specifically with homes and how that is a bigger part of this game, the ""roots"" is about how the series is going more towards its roots now by focusing on the villager interactions and the surprises in the village, and the ""home roots"" could mean how you are making this village your home as a new beginning in your life just like a ""true to form"" Animal Crossing game.

1) I told one of them “I feel like I am going to pass out, do you have any food or water?” he responded “Sorry?”

I didnt want to repeat my self and i said “I feel sick” he said “You can hand in your exam or have water”. I responded “I want to continue but I PHYSICALLY cant, I am on the verge of passing out”. I dont remember what was his response but I know for a fact he wasnt concerned at all. 

2) I kept asking for the time since I didnt couldnt remember the time I had started. The third i asked for the time he said “Sorry, but you cant read analog clocks?” 

3) He took me to the barhroom where I chugged some water and on the way back I took 4 sugar cubes from a uni coffee machine (and he gave me a very disgusted look), seeing that I mentioned to him “I studied the whole night, thats why I feel sick. “ After he took me back to the exam room he proceeded to talk with the other supervisor while both of them stared at me. 15 min before the end he came up to me and asked “Where are you from?”. Like wtf!?!!  

4) When he took my paper he said “You didint study for this, didint you?”

We get to the IHOP at 9 PM, which is early for me but it’s whatevs. I know the dumpsters out back have poor lighting and so I park there in case if we want to get up to some car fun without the added risk of doing it in the bathrooms, a move I find best reserved for late in a relationship, say, 6 weeks deep, because it reintroduces the sparks that have stopped flying. I get a country fried steak for sexual protein and they get some bullshit pancake dinner, a move I find carb-heavy and honestly unsexy, but hey, if they want to feel full of syrup then that’s up to them. I won’t tell anyone how to live their life (unlike most people I know).

So anyway, I won’t bore you with the details. Some hashbrowns and eggs and some coffee for some date energy later, and things are going great. We end up not having any carplay but I’m OK with that, if someone wants to get to know me first before we live like we’re in the fall of Rome then that’s strange, but I’m all about the strange. If anything it feels avant garde and interesting. We’re holding hands around Lake Eola and we end up hot and heavy beside the glitter of the water. A couple minutes of makeout sesh and hands staying over the clothes (but exploring all across them) later, and I pop the question, the one we all have on our minds:

“Which Severance character do you want me to be right now? And what are the rest of them doing to each other?”

Now, if you’ve seen Severance, you know this is a show meant to conjure up sexual fantasies of all the main characters on the screen having freaky freeplay rest and rectal relaxation together and any attempt to deny otherwise is a clear lie.

They pause and ask me “What?” and I think, OK pal, I’m all for playing coy to keep the mood hot. But then they take it too far and pretend they don’t know what I’m talking about. They say they don’t know what a Helly R is, or why I want to see a Dylan G rigged up in the shape of a pretzel as a Cobel looks in on the fun through a peephole in the subterranean room. They basically pissed all over the lore of this show and said they had to go, and then they took a swan boat solo to get on the other side of the lake and disappear into the night.

I’m typing this back in my car at that IHOP and I’m just remiss. People want to act like they haven’t seen this show and like they don’t fantasize about being any number of characters despite the whole thing being about everyone in sexual congress passing erotic legislation in the form of bodily fluid.

Like, maybe one level above the ones you'd find in a Motel6. It's got a hot plate to keep your coffee warm that a) gets a bit too hot imo and b) has absolutely no timer, thermometer, or failsafe of any kind for when you inevitably leave the thing on.

So I left about two cups of very normal brewed coffee in there overnight, and in the morning, of course all the water had boiled off. But my kitchen smelled Absolutely. Amazing. 

I knew instantly what had happened from the smell, so I quickly shut off the machine. Took a look inside the decanter: bunch of toasty coffee residue. Took a whiff: just a truly wonderful smell. Like burnt popcorn but in the best way possible (including the butteriness), vanilla, almonds, and somehow a little clove despite not having used a flavored coffee. Absolutely no unpleasant notes; if it were a candle on a shelf, I'd buy three.

There wasn't anything useful in there, but a little boiling water grabbed most of the stuff off the glass. Tasting notes: like if you smoked an already super smokey whiskey and then got rid of the whiskey. Not exactly delicious, but a little sugar dissolved in there made it pretty good, like the best parts of a s'more. 

Obviously there was some caramilization that happened, but that's the extent of my knowledge. I never work with candy or hot sugars or anything like that; the one time I tried to make candied walnuts was a relatively good-tasting disaster. 

I want to recreate this smell/taste in a syrup or something, but ideally faster than a couple teaspoons/day, and without making a stainless saucepan look like I tried to DIY Teflon. Any advice would be appreciated.

You get a ride, it’s amazing, but then you’re dropped at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere. Your phone has no signal, and you have no idea if the nearest town is a 5-minute walk or a 5-hour trek. That moment of uncertainty is something I wanted to solve.

I’m a developer who loves to travel, and I built an app called **SkyLocation** for exactly these situations. It’s a 100% offline GPS that uses your phone’s built-in hardware, so it works even when you have zero bars and no data plan.

It tells you your exact coordinates, altitude, and even the nearest city/country, all without needing to connect to anything. It also has an Emergency SOS feature that can send your location via satellite if you’re ever in a truly bad spot.

It’s a one-time purchase (less than a cup of coffee), no subscriptions, no ads, and it doesn’t track you. Just a simple tool for staying safe and oriented on the road.

I’ve gotten some amazing feedback from other travelers, and I’d love to hear what this community thinks. If you’ve ever been stranded without a map, this is for you.

It was fun place to walk around, yak with the locals, etc. It was a quintessential ""college town"" vibe.

I've never been back until last week. Apparently that world is long gone.

The idea of a traditional office space is being rethought as the professional world keeps changing. Coworking spaces have become an attractive option for independent contractors, startups, & even well-established companies looking for flexible and collaborative workspaces. The demand for these dynamic workspaces has been steadily increasing in the Kingdom of Bahrain, a country at the Gulf's business crossroads.\
\
We often wonder, ""Where precisely are these centers of innovation and productivity located within this island nation?"" This article seeks to give a thorough overview of Bahrain's coworking scene, illuminating their existence, traits, and growth-promoting factors. The conventional idea of a corporate office, where each employee has a set address, is no longer the pinnacle of professional life. Many people have become disengaged from their desks due to the digital age, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this change, demonstrating that productivity can flourish outside of physical buildings. The physical expression of this development is coworking spaces. They are ecosystems created to promote networking, cooperation, and a feeling of community among professionals from various backgrounds rather than just shared offices.\
\
If you're exploring the vibrant coworking scene in Bahrain, you might also be interested in understanding the visa options available for expatriates looking to work in the country. A related article that provides valuable insights on this topic is titled ""Why Get a Dependent Visa,"" which outlines the benefits and processes involved in obtaining such a visa.

\
Imagine a garden where the seeds of various businesses are sown, nourished by shared resources, and encouraged to flourish side by side. This is what coworking is all about. The transition from niche to mainstream. Coworking spaces were initially viewed as a specialty service, mainly serving the growing freelance & tech startup industries. However, their appeal grew as the advantages—cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and the built-in networking opportunities—became more obvious.\
\
Companies of all kinds started to see the benefits. It's a way for a small startup to provide a professional environment without having to make the large capital expenditure of a traditional lease. Establishing a presence in a new market without committing to a full-fledged office can be a strategic move for larger corporations, as can offering their remote employees flexibility. defining the experience of coworking.\
\
The fundamental idea of a shared workspace is still the same, but coworking spaces can differ greatly in terms of their offerings and ambiance. While some prefer a more bohemian, community-focused approach, others have a more corporate, polished feel, similar to a serviced office. The user experience is greatly influenced by elements like the membership tiers (hot desks, dedicated desks, private offices), the amenities provided (high-speed internet, meeting rooms, event spaces, printing facilities), and the general atmosphere. Finding the ideal fit for one's needs requires an understanding of these subtleties.\

These are not dispersed at random; rather, they tend to congregate in locations that are easily accessible and have a thriving business and amenity ecosystem. Consider these places as ideal settings for the growth of entrepreneurial spirit. Professionalism & prestige in the diplomatic domain. As the name implies, the Diplomatic Area is a major center for foreign companies, financial institutions, and embassies.\
\
Unsurprisingly, coworking spaces that serve professionals looking for a prestigious address and close proximity to well-known corporate players have made it a prime location. These areas, which provide luxurious meeting rooms & an elegant atmosphere, frequently radiate professionalism. They are the polished pieces that make up Bahrain's business environment.\
\
Executive suites & offices that are serviced. Coworking spaces that follow the more conventional serviced office model can be found in the Diplomatic Area. These are frequently more expensive, but they provide an all-inclusive package that includes meeting rooms that are fully furnished, dedicated IT support, and reception services. They are made for companies that value their reputation & need a turnkey solution to meet their operational requirements. Flexible workstations and private offices for professionals in business.\
\
There are plenty of coworking spaces in this area that provide more flexible options than the executive suites. This includes private offices of various sizes to suit small teams, dedicated desks for a more permanent setup, and hot desks for people who need a workspace on demand. Here, the focus is on offering a productive and professional workplace free from the hassle of long-term leases. Juffair: A vibrant mix of commercial and residential space.\
\
A major force in the coworking space, Juffair is a busy area well-known for its residential complexes and expanding commercial presence. A wide variety of professionals, from independent contractors to small enterprises, find it appealing due to its lively atmosphere and ease of access. Compared to the Diplomatic Area, which is solely focused on business, Juffair offers a more vibrant and possibly more laid-back atmosphere.\
\
It's the vibrant marketplace where a variety of skills can come together. Coworking spaces serving creatives and startups. A lot of Juffair's coworking spaces are designed with startups and creative professionals in mind.\
\
They frequently have more laid-back common areas, modern interior design, & an emphasis on creating a sense of community. These venues may provide networking opportunities, workshops, & a more direct method of fostering the development of their members. shared offices that prioritize the community.\
\

Connecting, working together, and supporting one another's endeavors are all encouraged among members. This can result in planned social events, networking opportunities, and educational opportunities that foster a genuine sense of community.\
\
Seef District: Business Development and Innovation. Coworking spaces are naturally drawn to the Seef District, a major commercial and entertainment hub. It is the perfect place for people looking for a dynamic and growth-oriented environment because of its accessibility, modern infrastructure, & closeness to important shopping malls & business establishments. Like a well-irrigated field, the Seef District is ideal for fostering creativity. Coworking spaces specifically designed for ambitious ventures.\
\
Seef has a number of coworking spaces that are specifically made to serve aspirational startups and expanding companies. They frequently take pride in their cutting-edge facilities, strong IT infrastructure, and commitment to offering the tools and assistance required for quick expansion. Innovative ideas are developed in these greenhouses until they reach maturity. Adaptable Workspace Options for a Changing Workload. Seef provides a variety of flexible workspace options, just like other desirable locations.\
\
Whether it's a private office for a growing team or a hot desk for a lone entrepreneur, these areas are made to change to meet the changing demands of contemporary businesses, much like a river does. An expanding network of other developing neighborhoods. Although the Diplomatic Area, Juffair, & Seef District are the main hubs, Bahrain's coworking space network is constantly growing.\
\
These centers of productivity are starting to appear in other carefully chosen neighborhoods as the demand keeps rising, illustrating the natural proliferation of opportunity. Business parks & zones for industry. Coworking spaces are also making their way into business parks & other locations that have historically been associated with industrial activity as companies look for logistical advantages or proximity to particular industries. This enables businesses to use the coworking model while staying close to their core business operations. Both residential and mixed-use projects. Coworking spaces are starting to appear in areas with a high density of residential properties and mixed-use developments to meet the needs of remote workers and local professionals who would rather remain closer to home.\
\
This represents a decentralization of employment, bringing opportunities closer to people's homes. There is much more to coworking spaces than just a place to work. The facilities & services provided are important differentiators that have a direct effect on members' well-being & productivity. The professional garden is able to flourish because of these vital nutrients.\
\
Comfort and connectivity are essential infrastructure. Any coworking space's fundamental infrastructure is its cornerstone. Reliable, high-speed internet is essential for modern work and cannot be compromised. For extended periods of productive work, ergonomic, comfortable furniture is essential. Fast internet and dependable wireless connectivity. This is what the digital age depends on.\
\
Because downtime can be detrimental to their members' work, coworking spaces place a high priority on reliable and stable internet connections. To guarantee uninterrupted connectivity, several internet providers and backup systems are frequently installed. comfortable workstations and ergonomic furnishings. The human body is not built to endure extended discomfort. To encourage physical well-being and long-term productivity, coworking spaces make investments in ergonomic chairs, movable desks, and bright workstations.\
\
This is comparable to giving a sculptor the best equipment possible. Tools for communication & teamwork. The ""co"" in coworking refers to encouraging collaboration rather than merely sharing space. Spaces are furnished with equipment & amenities that promote communication and interaction. Conference centers and meeting spaces.\
\
Coworking spaces give businesses a variety of ways to meet, from compact huddle rooms for spontaneous conversations to larger conference rooms with presentation technology for client meetings. These are the phases where decisions are made and ideas are put forth. Quiet zones & private phone booths.\
\
For concentrated work or phone calls, privacy is crucial in an open-plan setting. To guarantee focus and uphold professional etiquette, many coworking spaces offer soundproof phone booths and special quiet areas. This is the place where introspection is allowed. Possibilities for networking and community development. The opportunity for networking and community involvement is a big lure for coworking spaces.\
\
These areas actively foster a collaborative & interactive atmosphere. Events & workshops for networking. To help members connect with one another, exchange knowledge, and possibly create new business relationships, many coworking operators host frequent networking events, workshops, and social get-togethers. Ideas are shared around this communal fire.\
\
Community Platforms and Member Directory. In order to facilitate internal collaborations & support systems, some spaces offer member directories or online platforms that let members find each other's abilities and services. Beyond the Fundamentals: Business Support Services.\
\
Coworking spaces frequently provide a range of business support services that go beyond simply providing a workspace in order to further improve the value proposition. Support for administration and reception. Coworking spaces frequently offer professional reception services, mail handling, and other administrative support to companies without their own dedicated administrative staff. The main actors can shine because of this supporting cast. IT support, scanning, and printing.\
\
A standard feature is easy access to printing, scanning, & basic IT support, which eliminates the need for members to purchase their own equipment and troubleshoot. Refreshments and Kitchenette Facilities. The majority of coworking spaces provide well-equipped kitchenettes with free coffee, tea, and water in order to create a cozy and practical atmosphere, which is frequently enhanced by cozy breakout spaces. For any professional thinking about coworking, it is essential to comprehend the financial landscape of this type of work arrangement. For individuals & small businesses in particular, these spaces provide a flexible financial model that can be far more advantageous than traditional office leases.\
\
The value proposition, which offers flexibility and lower overhead, is comparable to a wise investment. Membership structures with tiers allow for flexibility for everyone. In order to accommodate different needs and budgets, coworking spaces usually provide a variety of membership tiers.\
\
The foundation of their adaptability is this tiered approach. The ""Pay-as-You-Go"" option is Hot Desks. The most adaptable and frequently least expensive choice is a hot desk. Members are free to use any desk in the designated common area.\
\
For independent contractors or people who occasionally require access to a professional workspace, this is perfect. Dedicated desks are a permanent location. Members can have a dedicated desk in a shared space. This gives people a feeling of stability and enables them to leave their possessions at their desk. It provides a harmony between personal space and communal areas.\
\
Private Offices: For both groups and individuals. Dedicated private offices are available for startups, small teams, or individuals who need a secure and private workspace. These come in a variety of sizes to suit various team sizes and provide a completely enclosed professional setting. All-inclusive Pricing: Expected Costs. Coworking's all-inclusive pricing is one of its main benefits.\
\
This indicates that the monthly cost usually includes utilities, internet, cleaning, & access to shared facilities in addition to the workspace. The unpredictable expenses of conventional office leases are greatly relieved by this predictability. Steer clear of the hidden expenses associated with traditional leases. Fit-out costs, utility bills, maintenance fees, & business rates are just a few of the numerous hidden costs associated with traditional office leases. By combining the majority of these costs into a single, predictable monthly payment, coworking spaces seek to make things easier.\
\
Adaptability and scalability. Coworking spaces' membership models make it relatively simple for businesses to scale their workspace requirements up or down. A startup may transition from a hot desk to a dedicated desk and eventually a private office as it expands. On the other hand, they can modify their membership if their needs decline. This flexibility is a crucial advantage in a dynamic business setting.\
\
The Kingdom's coworking spaces have a bright future thanks to Bahrain's dedication to economic diversification & its goal of becoming a regional center for innovation and entrepreneurship. These adaptable workspaces are expected to become even more important as the business environment develops. The present is only a sapling, but a thriving forest is what the future promises. initiatives & support from the government.\

Coworking spaces are regarded as essential elements of this ecosystem, offering these emerging companies the fundamental infrastructure. drawing in international talent and foreign investment.\
\

These locations provide international businesses looking to establish a presence with a plug-and-play solution. The increasing need for work models that are flexible. The global trend toward more flexible work schedules is a fundamental shift in where and how we work, not just a passing fad. Coworking spaces in Bahrain will surely expand & diversify as a result of this ongoing demand. The growth of workforces that are remote and hybrid.\
\

Introduction

Today, I would like to reflect on what it's like to be a new player in Division 2 in 2026. For the sake of experiment,  to experience all the pain of a beginner, I purchased the standard edition (without any add-ons). So, after launching the game, I thought I would immediately jump to level 40 and jump right into battle. But no, you can't do that in the standard edition. That's great, I thought, I'll remember how it was 6 years ago. The storyline, video inserts, additional missions. Lots of emotions and nostalgia from that time. Ubisoft, do your job. And after a couple of hours of nostalgia, I reached level 40. 



If you're a newbie, prepare for the worst.



So, I reached level 40, and I needed to build my equipment. It's clear that I need to go to the summit or countdown. An action hero is what a beginner needs. (Four action hero pieces, a Ceska vest with indestructibility, Sombra, and Famas with a killer). It seems like a simple plan that shouldn't take the player much time. In practice, everything turned out differently.

The community is the ""nicest people"" you'll ever meet. If you have a small Kinner clock, you're the scum of society. If you try to play summit or countdown on high difficulty or heroism, you'll be kicked out of the group. Okay, that's the way it is. 

But what amused me the most were the players with 10-15k who would dress in blue builds and tank hunters. 3-5 bullets and they're crawling on the floor. (Understand that the more damage you deal, the less you will take. And it doesn't matter how much armor you have.) Here's an example: in Countdown, at the very beginning, three tanks were killing a hunter. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Players with 15, 18, and 24k confidently defeated the hunter, and I managed to make coffee during that time. As a result, I was kicked out of the group. I am an inexperienced player, and we are blue Mandalorians who don't die, but can't kill anyone either. It's always the newbie's fault. The community with 1-5k hours will yell in voice chat, write nasty things in chat, and provoke you. Don't fall for it, just enjoy the game. Treat them like people with special needs.

And now, after a couple of runs, the action game is ready. It's time to go to the White House to optimize it. Oh no, you need a million resources to optimize the workbench, equipment, etc. Let's go to the countdown and start grinding. Four hours of hell: humiliation, being kicked out of groups, waiting for items with the right characteristics to drop, extraordinary people — that's grinding in Division 2. Next, you don't have enough resources and need to clear control points. I thought I was going crazy, but... there is a way to call for help. Let's do it. I thought it would be crazy people again, but that's not the case!!! Players with 30-60k helped us. They really helped: they gave advice, dropped items, THREW THE REANIMATOR HIVE, and enjoyed the gameplay. That's the essence and spirit of Division 2. You play and you enjoy it (special respect to you if you read this — thanks for the motor, Elma). 

So, after assembling and optimizing the build of the fighter with the Elma engine, I was surprised and shocked. (The whole build is red, but where did the chance and critical damage go???) It turns out that in the standard edition, you have to earn and upgrade Kinner's clock separately for weapon damage, chance, critical damage, and many other things—about 1,000 in total. In general, I had to adjust everything to 50 critical chance and critical damage to 100. Be prepared if you purchase the standard edition. Another surprise was that some specializations had to be unlocked separately by completing quests. But they went by pretty quickly. In my opinion, this is additional content.

END GAME

Even with an unleveled fighter build, I felt comfortable on legendary and heroic missions. True, I had to play more skillfully and use cover. Now, when selecting players, I wasn't kicked out of groups, and some even considered me a cheater (Guys!!! Learn how to disperse fighter stacks and keep them). 

I'll digress a little from the topic of newbies and tell you about a funny incident. 

So I decided to play the players on the Lost Paradise mission. The mission itself is not that difficult if you have an action-oriented build and know all the mechanics. That's why only experienced players play there, and newbies are simply afraid to go there. And here's the first run. I pretend to be a newbie (100 hours on the monitor). The ""experienced players"" start laughing and trying to talk me out of this suicidal run. As a result, the three of them are lying at one turret while I skillfully take out the other turret solo (using a decoy and an EMI stick). I run around my opponents in a circle and destroy the second turret in the same way. I play from cover and kill my opponents one by one. As a result, I am labeled a cheater and kicked out of the group. In the second run, I use an oxidizer build. And while players with levels 12-15k run to the turrets, the turrets are destroyed. You probably guessed it, I was kicked out and insulted in the chat as a cheater. Then I played a few more rounds (helping newbies). And then, during the matchmaking, I came across a player from the top ten in the rankings. I pretend to be a clueless newbie. They don't kick me out of the group, which makes me happy. The matchmaking begins, and another top-ranked player joins us in Lost Paradise. Everyone says hi in the chat, but it's clear from their silence that they're not happy to have a player like me (100 hours) in their group. We proceed calmly, and I don't stand out. And then, on the second boss, where there are drones, one player sees my hours and that I'm going calmly and not dying, and says, ""If you use cheats, we'll kick you."" But something didn't go according to plan; I always play actively. Forgetting that I'm on a newbie account, I speed up the action and methodically destroy everyone who moves. The drones are defeated, the boss is killed... Silence in the chat, silence in the game, most likely confusion on the players' faces.... Kicked out... I write to one of the players - why was I kicked out? ""u or other play with cheats and we kick u"" .LOL.  Guys, if you're reading this, thanks for the game. I always play fair! I play active because that's how the best taught me - and you are the best. No offense?

Result

It won't be easy for a newcomer to join Division 2 in 2026. You'll spend thousands of hours: understanding the mechanics of the game, choosing your build and playstyle, capturing hundreds of control points, finding friends or enemies, and what about raids? As everywhere else, there are pros and cons. After playing for about 10k hours, I want to delete the game... But after 6 years, it's still on my SSD... Peace out, with love, agent babangidas

Putting myself out there to make some genuine connections. I’m more on the introverted side and do best one on one or in smaller conversations. I’d much rather talk about real stuff, random thoughts, or trade sarcastic comments than force small talk.

My schedule is a little unconventional which means I’m around at odd hours and actually pretty consistent once I connect with someone. In warmer months I’m usually outside hiking, walking trails, or just enjoying being outdoors. In the colder months I slow things down with books, shows, coffee, and staying cozy.

I’m easygoing, laid back, sarcastic once comfortable, and a good listener. Looking for friends who want to actually talk and get to know each other, whether that’s daily chats or just checking in when life allows.

I'm talking about orexin, neuropeptide y, bdnf signaling peptides - these directly impact memory consolidation, attention, cognitive load tolerance

I did my phd studying neural circuits and one thing that always struck me is how obsessed biohackers are with adding exogenous compounds when they have zero idea whats happening with their endogenous systems. like youre injecting peptides to ""optimize"" but you dont even know if your brains baseline peptide signaling is functioning properly

heres what actually matters for cognitive performance:

orexin/hypocretin - regulates wakefulness and attention. when this system is off you get that brain fog feeling even with perfect sleep. low orexin = cognitive fatigue that no amount of coffee fixes

npy (neuropeptide y) - modulates stress response and memory under pressure. this is why some people can think clearly during high stress and others completely fall apart cognitively

bdnf and its signaling cascade - everyone knows bdnf for neuroplasticity but the peptide fragments that come from bdnf processing are what actually matter for real-time cognitive function. exercise boosts bdnf but if downstream signaling is broken you dont get the cognitive benefits

the problem is we have no good way to track these in real time. bloodwork gives you a snapshot but doesnt show you how your brain peptide systems respond to stress, sleep debt, cognitive load throughout the day. so people just... guess? and then throw exogenous peptides at problems they havent even identified

huberman talked about this indirectly in his peptide episode when he mentioned pleiotropic effects, these compounds hit multiple pathways and we dont really know what theyre doing in your specific system. but he didnt go deep enough on the fact that your endogenous peptide systems are probably the actual bottleneck

from my research perspective the future isnt ""what peptide should I inject"" its ""how do I measure whats actually broken in my cognitive signaling and address that specifically"". injection without measurement is just expensive guessing

curious if anyone here has actually tracked cognitive performance objectively (not just how you feel) before and after peptide protocols. like actual working memory tests, processing speed, sustained attention tasks. because subjective improvement ≠ actual cognitive improvement and thats the gap nobody talks about",3,1769236167.0,HubermanLab,1,0.81,False

We tried; we promised; we always held our hands together. We walk; she always sees my face and tells me, ""Are you okay?"" Deep inside my heart, I give up. But still, when I saw her face, I feel that I can achieve that world for her. We crossed the whole way after 5 hours of hill track. She is so exhausted; she gave up; she can't come back. I just hold her hand and tell her that the way we have to pass together, life is more beautiful. We get that confidence together while we are passing that way together. She sat down on a way, telling me, ""Are you leaving me halfway?"" I just smiled and told her back, ""The way you see, there is only me,"" whispering in her ear. Meanwhile, some hours later, she actually gave up. She told me that I can't. I just held her on my back, telling her, ""Hold me tight; don’t move. I can't cross the whole road for you."" After the whole way, I just held her; eventually, we crossed. We just hired a van. I can see the beautiful moon over the sky. ""I just asked her, 'Do you know who is more beautiful, the moon or you?'"" She smiled. I told her, ""The moon is nothing compared to your beauty."" She glances and holds me tight. I feel so exhausted; I just fall asleep on her lap. Time goes so fast. Now that’s the time; I can only remember the memories. She left by any chances; soul getting despair; I can fly in the sky now, but with me, downtown to hill, I am still waiting for the train when the train arrived but still it doesn’t arrive at the station. I just waiting for that smile or someone calling by my name. In the winter again, I see the sky and moon; everything is faded away; no one understands the things. I am thinking that she is happy. Does she remember me? Sometimes, something is beautiful in a distance. I can feel her in every moment; I can feel her fragrance touches her skin, and even I talked with her last night. I feel exhausted; maybe her memories roaming around my mind in every hour; that's not a story everyone remembers, but that's the story I remember.",1,1769235694.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Fall is so much fun.

Halloween. Thanksgiving.

Crunchy leaves that sound like snacks.

Pumpkin spice everywhere

in my coffee,

in my soul.

The air gets crisp.

Winter peeks around the corner like,

“Hey… you ready?”

And honestly?

I don’t mind.

Blankets get thicker.

The bed gets cozier.

Life happens under covers now

and that feels kind of perfect.

My kid has the sniffles.

No big deal.

All kids get sick this time of year.

She’s a little weak.

Okay.

Her temperature is 103.

Oh my god.

Urgent care.

That waiting room smell.

Amoxicillin for the win.

We’re home.

We’re good.

Hot chocolate.

Christmas movies.

Hope is back.

I’m excited.

Wait—

she has the sniffles.

She’s weak.

Her temperature is 103.

Oh.

Another year of this.

Constant sickness.

Constant emails that start with,

“Hi, I’m so sorry but—”

“I have to go, my kid is sick.”

Again.

And again.

And again.

Every winter,

just when I think we’re in the clear,

it comes back—

like a boomerang made of germs

and bad timing.

I’m tired.

She’s tired.

Winter is always dark.

And being a single mother,

this season should really be called:
