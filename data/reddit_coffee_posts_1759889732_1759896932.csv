1o10o8i,https://v.redd.it/qn51eb4dcttf1,why was my cat treated like this at the vet?,"Basically why do vets give up on seniors so easily. Long post/rant incoming 

I have a ball in my throat writing this. I’ve had my cat Chibi Tenshi Ai since I was 15. I call him Chibi and he is my absolute soulmate and twin flame. He’s the most important thing in my life and has been the only one there for me. I am still a single woman at 36 but for the past 22 hes been my tiny angel (Chibi Tenshi Ai literally translates to “tiny angel of love”) I am nothing without my cat, I consider him to be my son and have have built entire pillow fort kingdoms for him to lounge in, rearranged my furniture so the sunlight hits him perfectly and every night I sing him a little lullaby as he falls asleep in my arms.

When my baby was 14 i noticed he wasn’t drinking water after I played with him (he would always go drink after a play session) and I felt it in my heart that he had kidney failure I immediately got him to a E-Vet and the nightmare was confirmed. He was diagnosed with early stage kidney failure and I immediately acted. He was put on a diet for cats with renal issues, got started giving him subcutaneous fluids at home, hand-feeding him when he wouldn’t eat, crushing his meds into his meals, watching every tiny twitch, every blink. 

Every month we went to the vet and even when they said he was stable enough to only be seen twice a year I payed for checkup every month and just be sure I hired a behavioralist who specializes in senior cats. Over the years he’s also gotten arthritis and was put on solensia shots, I also made sure to massage him daily, provide gummy’s and vitamins for joints and bought ramps and heated blankets to keep him comfy. 

My sweet boy and I had so many good years like- i never left his side not even for a mintues, he goes everywhere I go (i work from home and order my groceries so i only really go my family’s houses or in the car to get takeout/coffee- nothing that would stress him) In 22 years I don’t think I ever spent more than 3 hours away from him.

Then the worst day of my life happened. I was giving him his massage when he tensed up- I was so dumb and thought he was stretching untill he started to tremble. I wish I could say I acted right away and scooped him up to the vet but I didn’t, it’s like my body didn’t let me move and I failed him. 

I just starting screaming and crying untill my neighbors checked on me, I was not in an okay state to drive so my neighbor took me to the emergency vet which was so kind of her. I couldn’t drive my own son to the hospital.

When we finally pulled into the parking lot, I sprinted to the entrance and the vets got Chibi to the exam room. 

I they told me that his kidneys were failing worse than ever, and even with all I was doing it was looking like a uremic crisis.  They explained that his senior body might not survive surgery, and that he could die on the table or suffer permanent brain or nerve damage from the stress and lack of oxygen.

 I actually threw up in the exam room. 

The vets to tried to get me to kill him then and there but I know my boy and I know he’s a fighter and I BEGGED them to save him and they did. 

I wasn’t allowed in the surgery room and just had panic attacks until they called me in an hour later to say he survived 💗💗💗 I fell to my knees in that vet office y’all. But the nightmare wasn’t over- They told me that his tiny body had a uremic blockage and that even though they saved his kitty life he wasn’t doing well and was and needed to be put down.

No like they actually said he needed to be put down.

I raised as much hell as I could for my baby, i’ll admit I said some things to those vets I regret but the way they just wanted to kill Chibi after he fought so hard to see me again made my blood boil.  

I made sure  to see my baby and asses it for myself and sure enough he opened his eyes and blinked right at me. WE HAVE A SOUL BOND. This was all I needed to see to know he still wanted to be here, he still had life left. 

They tubed him since he wasn’t moving or eating by himself and told me that he would stay overnight so he could be monitored and they could assess him and keep him on fluids. obviously, I was gutted when they said I couldn’t spend the night with him and had to leave him (I really never thought that was fair because at  human hospitals they have spaces for family to sleep and just because our family members might have fur instead of skin doesn’t mean it should be any different )

So for the first time in my life in 22 years I called an uber and went home to a house without my cat. I didn’t sleep. The entire week he was under surveillance at the vet I woke up at 6am and drove to see him for as long as they’d let me. I slept in my car because the night I spent in my house alone was so awful. I had no one to sign my lullaby’s too.

I’ve lost 2 pounds that week for the stress and trauma of almost losing my son- i’m in the process of trying to get diagnosed with PTSD.

A week later the vets said he could go home. They were incredibly rude and were not happy at all to see Chibi leave alive.-yeah fuck that vet forever🖕🏻 i’m glad i didn’t listen because then I would have lost my baby.

For the past few weeks i’ve been setting an alarm every hour to check on him and make sure he’s still breathing (one of the reasons i think i have ptsd) I wake up at 5:30 everyday to change flush his line. He spends almost all day curled up under his heated blankets, and I swear he’s just resting, recharging his energy for me💗

It’s been weeks and he’s okay now, still needs to be hand feed and I now handle all his grooming but it pains me that we’re willing to let go without a care in the world? 

I mentioned the slow blinks when he was in the vet and they didn’t seem to think it mattered. 

I just can’t believe I almost lost my baby, the silver lining is that since he’s no longer sbke to move without assistance I get to spend even more time loving on him. 

All this to say even though the vets said he would be miserable, that he might not have a life worth living, I see him in every glance, every little twitch, every sigh. He’s alive, he’s here, and I will do everything to keep him safe, comfortable, and loved, no matter how hard it is. My world is Chibi, my tiny angel, and I will never leave him.",1,1759896673.0,catquestions,1,1.0,False
1o10nbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/1o10nbn/why_arent_mens_dress_shoes_more_versatile/,Why aren’t men’s dress shoes more versatile,"This morning around 7am I was getting ready for work — typical business-casual day in the city. I’m half awake, coffee in hand, standing at my shoe rack staring at my three “office-appropriate” options: a pair of loafers, some oxfords, and my go-to white Tommy Hilfiger business-casual shoes with the navy heel tab.

I’m wearing beige chinos and a light blue button-down, and I literally caught myself thinking: “Man, I wish that heel tab matched my outfit.”

At that moment I realized how limited men’s business casual/dress shoes are when it comes to versatility. You either: buy one boring all white pair, buy another pair in a slightly different color just to match your outfit better, suck it up and wear the mismatch, or change your outfit to work with the shoes.

It made me wonder — am I the only one who runs into this?

Do you guys ever wish there were more versatile or interchangeable options for men’s business-casual/professional shoes? Like, something where small details could change to match the outfit or setting without buying a whole new pair?

Curious if this is just me overthinking morning outfits or if others have felt the same frustration.

- I am comfortable talking with cashiers at stores or little interactions but barely ever speak up at work when we have our morning coffee and if I do I’m highly critical of what I said and regret speaking 

- I don’t have many friends but feel like I am a solid friend to my highschool friends. These friends all live far away from me but I whenever I am around them I feel okay. I hear from them especially if they have a crisis.

- growing up I was too embarrassed to try hard and sports. I would just rather not do it than try and suck. 

- I am a people pleaser 

- I am married and pretty comfortable with my husband. But this weekend we were at a conference for a disease I have and I refused to ask any questions. I made him ask the questions for me. This was in a big auditorium so I didn’t find it that strange I didn’t want to get up and talk.

But then we went to a museum that had an exhibit where you could virtually ask holocaust survivors questions. There was no one else in the room but 2 museum workers and I couldn’t ask any questions I wanted to. I whispered for my husband do it for me. I felt weird about it and knew this was strange but couldn’t bring myself to say anything in front of these 2 workers. 

- I focus on shameful situations in my past and replay them in my mind. Situations from like 15 years ago even and still feel mortified. 

- Reddit is hard for me. If someone disagrees with me or downvotes me I delete the post and obsess over it. I find Reddit very shameful and delete a lot of the things I post. 


But my question is. How do you justify in your own mind icing people out? I find myself annoyed easily of others and that I notice their flaws and just want to cut them out. I am not perfect and very hard on myself so I’m not sure why I’m so intolerant of others. I just wanted to see if anyone else does this or feels this way.

I want to start off by saying that I am very new to this craft and not knowledgeable at all.

Upon taking out my portafilter, it ""exploded"" with coffee and looked to be blocked. I have experimented with finer grinds, different amounts (the upper limit being 18g) and ran into the same issue all the way up to grind size 20 which actually did work but ended up being quite sour.

My issue is this: I'm 28(F) I've never had trouble with my roommates, and I've still to this day kept in touch with some of them. However, I just moved into a lovely house about 5 months ago, and everything has been great, except that I made my roommate, 29(M), who lives across the hall from me, frustrated with me, and I'd appreciate any advice regarding steps forward. 

We all live in a big, big house (two living rooms, one dining room, a porch, a garage, the works). Before I moved in I was informed that some people in the house smoked weed, and I said I was totally fine with that. I used to smoke a lot (not as much anymore) and have always lived with lettuce heads, so all dandy!

I live on the second floor with three other guys, one of whom spends most of his time at his girlfriend's place, so I hardly see him. My room is adjoining the second-floor living room, with the entrance kind of merged into this living room. The tension started when the other guy on our floor moved out, and the other roommate (we can call him Jim?) kinda took over the living room with another roommate that lives in the basement (we can call him Joe). Hanging out, watching TV, playing video games, inviting people over late every couple of nights, pretty loud too, which is fine, I really don't mind, and even might have wanted to join in! But then I came home one day from a long day at work (I work 10-hour shifts as a gardener) and they were smoking blunts in the living room outside my room. It's kind of a harsh smell, and I found that it had really stuck in my room. I asked my landlord what the smoking-in-house rules were in specific areas, and she said that cigarettes are strictly prohibited, but pot is OK in common areas only if the other members of the floor are OK with it.

I have real trouble with confrontation at all (I'm introverted as hell), so it took me a couple of days to send a text to him along the lines of ""I'm so sorry, I love the vibe you have going on, but is it possible to not smoke in the second-floor living room? The smell gets into my room. So sorry to ask, and would love to go out for coffee sometime!"". I didn't ask this lightly, as there are many other places to smoke in the house (he has a private balcony, the other living room, the patio, the dining room). I also should have been clearer, because recently I've had a bit of trouble with my lungs as well, like fully breathing in. Never had a problem before, but I think it's because I have a physically taxing job, and also because my family has a history of weaker lungs and late-onset asthma. It's also kind of hard to admit this to myself/say aloud, because I've always been known for my physical robustness in my family. 

Anyway, Jim responded with ""Thanks for the communication! Let's talk when you get back."", and I agreed, because communicating face-to-face is usually better for everyone. Got home, and he said he was tired from work, and couldn't, and I replied that we could talk tomorrow. He didn't text me back, but I did notice that he spent less time in the living room and didn't smoke weed there anymore. However, I did see that there were vapes on the table, so they were still smoking there, just not when I was around. 

Then I got home last week, and Jim was hanging with Joe, who was smoking a vape right outside my door, so I had to walk through with my poor taqitos to get inside. I felt a little sad, because before we were all pretty friendly, and after that I felt a bit disrespected/defeated, so the next afternoon I had my headphones on in the kitchen and busied myself with cooking my dinner instead of saying hi when they came in. Immature, I know. So I figured I had to man up and just talk with them in a friendly way about my issue, and just ask if they could limit/not smoke in the second-floor living room, as I'm having some lung issues recently, and sorry I hadn't mentioned that the first time. Also added that I am going to be out of town for long periods of time during the holidays, and I'll let them know so they can smoke as much as they want there those weeks. Got a bit of a lackluster answer from both; they seemed uncomfortable, and I felt really bad. 

The same night, they had a movie on that was turned up super loud, and I kept getting woken up. This happens sometimes, and they usually pack it in at 11:30/12, but tonight it was later, and we have quiet hours at 11pm on work days. At 1:30 am, I was woken again, and I was disappointed that I had to speak with them again, and tired, and I just stepped outside my door and waited until  I had their attention, and asked, ""Could you turn it down? Trying to sleep."" in a flat tone, and then just closed the door. They've been avoiding me after this, and I've been avoiding them as well tbh.

Tonight, Jim was talking with a few other roommates, and I was a bit uncomfortable and just decided to make dinner and put on my headphones, and avoid joining in on the convo, but through my headphones I heard Jim say, ""Yeah, I love living here, but people need to understand that we smoke here"". Clearly directed towards me, oof. The other roommate replied with something like ""yeah, but I like to smoke inside my room so it doesn't bother anyone"" and laughed it off. So I felt a little better with that answer, but I'm still just bummed that it came to this. Maybe he thought I was ignoring him in the kitchen, and it made him mad? I used to be a smoker to, so I thought I could relate. I also just feel so so awkward about the whole thing, and don't know how to address it. Please help!

Brew coffee in moka pot. Pour in a cup.

Put milk in French press and pump until creamy.

Add it to the coffee.

I usually add sugar to the empty cup and then pour coffee, stir and then add milk on top.

I think powdered sugar will work better.

im trying to deal with something right now and i really need some advice because im feeling guilty and idk wtf to do or how i got myself into this. basically yesterday I saw this reddit post about this guy at my school talking about how hes been feeling rlly lonely and how he has no friends. usually im not active on reddit and i dont ever rlly respond or reach out to people but i dmed him and said if he ever wanted to talk im here. we chatted a bit and we have the same psych class and he asked me to hangout. he also told me he has severe autism. i normally dont just hang out with strangers but i said okay. i told him im going to the library to study and we can book a group study room if he wants to join me. he said okay and we booked one and met up around 2:30. mind you we literally chatted for the first time that same day and hadnt even known each other for 24 hours. while we were in the public library everything was fine and we didnt talk much other than casual greetings and small talk but for the most part it was silent. we only booked it for half an hour and so at 3pm we had to leave bc another group was there. i went to go grab coffee and he had an exam at 4:30 in the area so we decided to stay around and see if we could find somewhere else to study. we went to the underground basement area and it was kinda awkward so i was just tryna make small talk. we were walking in the underground tunnel hallways of our student centre and we found an empty classroom. we went in and were chatting and he started to open up to me about his mental health issues. he told me at the age of 2 his mother noticed strange patterns in his behaviour and took him to a child psychiatrist. he was diagnosed with severe autism at the age of 6. he told me he struggled with emotional control his whole life. he also told me about how he was born in hong kong and he moved here summer of 2022 so he has been struggling to find friends and feels lonely. i told him that i was sorry and that im here if he wants to talk but i emphasized about how he should speak to a professional about his thoughts and mental health because it was really clear to me that he struggled from what he was saying and his general mannerisms. i told him about on campus free therapists and how there are help resources if he reaches out. 

He kinda didn't really say anything so i tried to change the conversation by asking typical questions like if he likes to travel and whatnot. but whenever he would ask me questions they would always be pertaining to relationships. like whats one thing i look for in a guy and stuff like that. so i gave general responses and tried to shift the conversation. but he kept bringing up dating and he was talking about how his dad told him that when he goes to university hes going to meet a female student and hes not going to be single anymore and how he has to respect and love her and all that. and he was like ""im not going to ask you to be my girlfriend yet because its way too early and ik we just met"" but he was talking to me as if its gonna happen in the near future. he also asked if i have a boyfriend and when i said no he asked me what my type is and i told him that as much as I would love a relationship, im not rlly looking for anything rn bc all guys wanna do is fuck. and he was like ""you mean having SEX"" and i just laughed it off but he seemed perplexed by that so I was trying to divert the conversation. i asked him what his fav food was and i told him i loved sushi and how last week my dad took me to this sushi restaurant ten mins from campus. i showed him pics from my phone and he leaned in to look and he put his arm around my shoulder. I instantly felt uncomfortable but i didnt wanan be mean so i thought i could jsut bear with it even tho the mere thought right now is making my skin crawl. i told him i dont really like physical touch and he removed his arm. we spent about an hour in this empty classroom and it was time for his exam so i walked him to it and he was like ""ik you said u dont like physical touch but i wanted to give you a hug"" so i hugged him bc i honestly felt so bad and and he hugged me so tight and i said bye and walked away and I immediately broke down into tears. 

I feel so perplexed because he has been texting me trying to call or hang out and asking me more intimate questions and i feel bad and invalid to feel uncomfortable bc im rlly the one who put myself in this situation. idk what to do. I dont wanna just ghost him because thats mean but at the same time this is not someone i see myself dating. I rlly just wanted to do a nice thing because he was lonely and whats another friend right? i thought the worst case would be that i get a friend out of this yknow. but i can clearly see that he is almost growing infatuated with me and i cant stop crying about it bc i feel so so bad. I cant be that girlfriend that he wants and idk how to tell him that.

i also feel like i should mention the fact that after we hung out i went through some of his reddit history and comments and its clear he has a porn addiction and he has some violent tendancies. that scares me alot considering 

a) we both live on campus and he knows my building, name, and enough about me, and 

b) he was SO perplexed when i mentioned how guys wanna only fuck as if that was an insane idea but his history is showing otherwise so idk if its all some manipulation or what but im so scared and i genuinely dont know what to do from here. Its clear he struggles alot with his emotions and mental health. this whole situation is just pulling on my heart strings because ive never felt more uncomfortable but also guilty for feeling uncomfortable. I also saw that hes been posting on relationship advice subredits asking for advice on our situation. this all just happened so quick and idk what to do so i legit made a new reddit account and blocked him on it just so that he doesnt see this post on my old one. Im feeling scared and a little concerned for my safety at this point. what should i do, pls help me, and pls lmk if im looking too much into this.

1o10gyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1o10gyz/help_wet_pucks/,Help! Wet Pucks,"Since yesterday, I’ve been paying more attention to my coffee and noticed that our pucks are no longer formed and dry. My husband usually makes my coffee in the morning and he doesn’t really notice this kind of stuff, so I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started. 

Does anyone know what could have caused this? Here are a few changes I can think of:
1. Since we moved to our new home, our water is now softened and we recently had an RO system install without mineralization. The last time I’ve noticed the pucks were hard was when we lived in a different home with hard water. We were using refrigerator filtered water then so it was still hard.
2. I recently did a big maintenance this weekend: descaled, oil removal tablets, washed  and lubricated the brew group, & changed the filter. I do notice bubbles in the water tank.
3. I switched beans (Lavazza Espresso Italiano to Lavazza Oro) and played with the grinder settings yesterday; though I ended up keeping it at 3 anyway (settings for years). I only switched the grinder settings when the machine was grinding.

Should I just give it time? Or is it one of those things? ",1,1759896026.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False
1o10gy9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o10gy9,My friend’s neighbors are awful.,"My best friend lives in an ADU unit that was originally a garage. Their landlords are nice enough, but refuse to do anything about the neighbors. When I usually come over, I park across the street where my best friend and her boyfriend usually park. Today, I was only coming to drop off a coffee and hang out for a little while before work and I parked in front of her neighbor’s house. I was not blocking the driveway, but my car was in front of their mailbox. To be completely honest, I didn’t realize I was anywhere near their mailbox, but my car is small and they / mail carriers could still easily have access to it. I was at my friend’s house for almost 45 minutes and when I walked out, they had left a note on my windshield talking about some federal offense that I was committing with my parking job. I completely understand if I had parked there multiple times and really was blocking their mailbox - they would absolutely have a right to be pissed. I NEVER park there and only did today because it was in the shade and I wasn’t going to be there for long. 

Here’s the real issue - 

I, being an asshole, parked in front of their house again when I came back after work. I made 100% sure not to block the mailbox and even took a picture of my car / their mailbox because I was being petty enough so they could see my car but not enough to get in trouble. Me and my friend wrote a note back (3rd pic) but did not leave it for them yet. Her boyfriend left to get food for us and when he came back, he saw their trashcans completely blocking my car on the street. I called the non-emergency line to make sure it was okay to move their trash cans without getting in trouble / causing a problem. 

Some notes:
It is a public street, and when I arrived earlier in the day, they had their car parked in the middle of the sidewalk space between my friend’s house and their house, making it possible for me to only park either in front of their mailbox (not blocking their driveway), or in front of my friend’s landlord’s driveway - blocking it. I would love to just let go of the situation, and will probably end up not even leaving the note, but I’m still annoyed and my friends are as well. It’s also common knowledge for the landlords that the neighbors are just complete assholes. What should I do?

If you're anything like me up at 3 AM cramming flashcards while doom-scrolling nursing headlines you're probably feeling the weight of it all right now. The LA Times just dropped a bombshell about California's nursing schools turning away thousands of applicants because of limited seats and denied clinical placements, even as the state stares down a shortage that's projected to leave us 61,000 RNs short by 2033. And it's not just Cali; nationally, we're facing a deficit of over 500,000 registered nurses by the end of this year, fueled by an aging population, burnout from the pandemic aftermath, and skyrocketing demand for care. Meanwhile, the latest NCSBN data shows NCLEX-RN pass rates tanking to 71.6% down from 79.1% last year for first-time U.S.-educated takers, with even steeper drops for repeat testers and international students. The Next Gen NCLEX's new clinical judgment focus is kicking our butts, and with enrollment in nursing programs barely holding steady (up just 0.3% per AACN's latest), it's clear: we need more nurses yesterday, but getting through school feels impossible.

As a nursing educator who's mentored hundreds of students through this chaos (and survived my own N2 nightmares), I created the N2 Exam #3 Review: 2025 Edition Practice Questions to cut through the noise. This isn't some dusty PDF it's a targeted, high-yield resource packed with 200+ updated practice questions mirroring the latest exam blueprint, designed to build your confidence and crush those tricky scenarios. In a world where clinical rotations are scarce and stress is sky-high, this guide helps you prep smarter, not harder, so you can pass your exams, snag that licensure, and help fill those critical gaps on the floor.

Why This Review is Your Secret Weapon in 2025:

* NGN-Aligned Clinical Judgment Questions: 70% of questions focus on prioritization, delegation, and real-world decision-making the stuff that's tanking pass rates. Includes case studies on everything from acute care simulations to ethical dilemmas, just like the live exam.
* Detailed Rationales & Test-Taking Strategies: Every answer breaks down why it's right (or wrong), with tips on spotting distractors and managing time. Plus, a bonus section on overcoming post-COVID clinical gaps, like adapting to hybrid training environments.
* Updated for 2025 Trends: Covers hot topics like telehealth integration, mental health crises in aging patients, and equity in care pulled from the latest WHO and HRSA reports on global nursing disparities.
* Mobile-Friendly & Interactive: Downloadable PDF with clickable links to video breakdowns and a self-assessment quiz. Track your progress and identify weak spots in under 30 minutes a day.
* Affordable & Instant Access: Just $19.99 cheaper than one coffee run during finals week. Lifetime updates included, so you're covered through licensure.

I've seen students go from ""I'm dropping out"" tears to ""I passed with 85%!"" high-fives after using this. It's helped dozens in my study groups boost their scores by 15-20 points on average.

Real Wins from Fellow Students (Beta Testers):

* ""Finally nailed those delegation questions passed my N2 on the first try amid all the shortage stress!"" – Sarah, senior at a Cali BSN program.
* ""The rationales made the NGN click. No more guessing games."" - Jamal, repeat tester who aced it second time around.

I’m half awake, coffee in hand, standing at my shoe rack staring at my three “office-appropriate” options: a pair of loafers, some oxfords, and my go-to white Tommy Hilfiger business-casual shoes with the navy heel tab.

I’m wearing beige chinos and a light blue button-down, and I literally caught myself thinking: “Man, I wish that heel tab matched my outfit.”

At that moment I realized how limited men’s business casual/dress shoes are when it comes to versatility. You either: buy one boring all white pair, buy another pair in a slightly different color just to match your outfit better, suck it up and wear the mismatch, or change your outfit to work with the shoes.

It made me wonder — am I the only one who runs into this?

Do you guys ever wish there were more versatile or interchangeable options for men’s business-casual/professional shoes? Like, something where small details could change to match the outfit or setting without buying a whole new pair?

Curious if this is just me overthinking morning outfits or if others have felt the same frustration.

So, I stay in a girls’ PG, and last night around 11 PM I went to make myself some coffee. There’s a “rule” that after 10-11 pm we have to switch off the lobby lights once we’re done cooking.
When I went there, another girl was already cooking and washing dishes so the lights were already on. She left for her room, and right then the warden came to the lobby (apparently to use the washroom). I figured it would be stupid to switch off the light while the warden was standing there it would’ve gone completely dark. Plus, the other girl might’ve come back down in a minute.
A few minutes later, the warden literally banged on my door, started shouting, called me a liar, and abused me and my parents. When I calmly said I didn’t even switch on the light, she tried to slap me.
  She kept insulting me. I honestly don’t feel safe around her anymore. I am literally traumatised.

Though seemingly invincible, Talos had a single weakness: a vein sealed by a thin membrane near his ankle. When pierced, his life force drained out, and the robot collapsed.

In the Greek imagination, Talos was both a marvel of craftsmanship and a warning. His destruction was not due to brute force, but to the exploitation of a *single point of failure*. The moral suggests that any critical system dependent on a single fragile element is both brittle and perilous. The flaw may be hidden, but it will eventually be found.

I was reminded of this ancient insight after purchasing an electric lawn mower. Wanting to be environmentally conscious, I chose electric over gas to reduce emissions. At first, the mower worked beautifully. It cut quietly, efficiently, and cleanly. But soon the blade began slipping, which required that I mow the same patch repeatedly.

I stooped down and looked underneath, and found the problem. The blade was saddled by a single, small, 2 inch by 3 inch orange plastic connector about 1/8 inch in thickness. The vendor charged $22.00 for a replacement. I doubt it costs more than 1 cent to make. The new part worked for a few weeks when suddenly one afternoon, the blade flung out of the mower and across the yard, striking a fence post.

# The Razor-and-Blades Model

I searched online in vain for an after-market device, one better designed, as a replacement. Sometimes companies make inexpensive base-model products at a certain price point to capture sales, then offer add-ons to recoup lost margins. It is a strategy known as the *razor-and-blades model*. Named after the original Gillette approach, it means sell the main unit cheaply (the razor handle), then profit from the proprietary parts that follow (blades).

Printer makers, coffee-pod systems, electric tools and smart devices use the same logic. The *competitive base price* masks or defers the true lifetime cost to the consumer, which is transferred to the required components or subscriptions that follow.

Hewlett-Packard and other laser printer companies perfected this approach years ago: the basic unit seems affordable until you add up the costs of replacement toner and drums. The consumer feels they have made a thrifty purchase, yet the real expense lies ahead. It is a kind of quiet lock-in, where the product’s affordability depends on your willingness to keep buying its fragile or proprietary components, each one small, each one costly, and none truly optional.

# Planned Obsolescence

It is still possible to make durable products. So why don’t more manufacturers do it? Like my mower, modern devices are filled with plastic where metal once went, often molded and patented so the manufacturer has a corner market on replacement parts. These are not oversights. They form part of a deliberate strategy identified decades ago called *planned obsolescence*.

The concept emerged in the 1930s when real estate broker Bernard London proposed planned obsolescence to revive the post-depression economy. The industrial designer Brooks Stevens expanded the concept in the 1950s, defining it not as making things poorly, but as instilling in consumers “the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary.” Today, that desire has indeed been replaced by making products poorly. Planned obsolescence no longer necessarily means complete catastrophe: it also means designing fragility directly into critical components. The replacement part keeps you attached. The obsolescence kicks in when the manufacturer discontinues the replacement part.

# Brittle Technologies

In technology, it appears as software updates that slow older devices, sealed electronics that resist repair, and discontinued support for perfectly functional systems. Microsoft’s recent decision to end support for Windows 10 is a case in point. Many users find that upgrading to Windows 11 also requires buying new hardware. The industry term for this is called *friction*: creating obstacles between users and functionality to encourage continual upgrading. When the World Wide Web first emerged 30 years ago, friction was a bad thing. Now, it is standard business practice.

# Appliances

Modern household appliances follow the same logic. When our dishwasher failed, the technician told us most machines now last only five to seven years. The failure came from a computing unit placed at the top of the door and directly above where steam collects. Who thought putting computer chips over constant vapor was a good idea? After a $300 repair, the water pump broke. I replaced it myself with a part from an appliance warehouse, but it didn’t work. We eventually replaced the entire unit. Meanwhile, our 30-year-old Amana refrigerator still runs perfectly. We’ve gone through four dishwashers in that time.

# Consumer Pushback

In 2024, a [class-action lawsuit was filed against GE Appliances](https://www.lawsuitupdatecenter.com/ge-refrigerator-class-action-lawsuit.html) alleging that certain refrigerator models contain compressors that may fail prematurely, leading to cooling problems and costly repairs. The complaint, which is still pending, claims the defect is “latent,” meaning it might not be apparent at the time of purchase, and asserts violations of warranty and consumer protection laws. GE has not admitted wrongdoing, and the case has not been resolved. Regardless of outcome, the lawsuit reflects growing consumer frustration with modern appliances whose hidden components, often proprietary and sealed, can render an entire machine useless when they malfunction, reinforcing the broader concern that fragility has become built into the design itself.

[Talos](https://preview.redd.it/dnr5p06t8ttf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d9b4190990792c5751352995d55153fcce8df5f)

# A Logic of Economic Hubris

In Talos, the Greeks encoded humility: the thin membrane sealing his vein symbolized a metaphysical boundary, a reminder that even the most advanced creation remains subject to failure. Hephaestus, god of craftsmanship, was known for precision, but not oversight. The vulnerability of Talos may not have been a mistake at all. It could have been a deliberate safeguard, a way to ensure control or disablement if needed. Perhaps Hephaestus feared his own creation.

American manufacturers have inverted that logic. The single point of failure is no longer a risk to mitigate but a tool to exploit. They act not as Hephaestus, who was careful, deliberate, and respectful of limits, but as Icarus, prideful and reckless, convinced they can defy gravity and tempt the sun. When they fly too close, the wings fail, held together by the thinnest connective tissue. Through manipulation of patent laws and corrupt politicians, they ensure that users will return for replacements.

Populating landfills with intentionally short-lived technologies is neither wise nor sustainable. The disposable mechas in the “Flesh Fair” of Steven Spielberg’s film *A.I.* (2000) show what happens when arrogance displaces common sense in the manufacturing of artificially intelligent beings (see the previous post [What Does Myth Teach Us About AI Hyperbole?](https://technomythos.com/2025/10/01/what-can-myths-teach-us-about-ai-hyperbole/).) Designing products to fail, and consumers to depend on that failure, is not innovation. It is hubris disguised as progress. Yet for some in big business, the single point of failure is no longer a risk to be mitigated, but a feature to be exploited. It is used to ensure obsolescence, to render technology unusable, control consumer behavior, enforce dependence, and drive cycles of perpetual consumption, and for that, all of us lose out.

Private pods or small rooms with proper soundproofing

A relaxed lounge serving wine or coffee instead of cheap beer

Quiet corners for reading or working; not late-night parties

Soothing jazz or world music playing in the background and not hard-thumping EDM

Communal breakfasts where conversations are about travel, life, or ideas and not hangovers

Spa-like bathrooms that actually feel clean, with good water pressure

Gastro-menus vs cheap, quality-lacking food

Maybe even morning yoga or small group walks instead of bar crawls

It would still be social and affordable, but calmer, more intentional and designed for adults who want connections without chaos.

So why aren’t there more of these?

Is it because “hostel” is so tied to youth culture?  Or because older travelers are expected to choose hotels and miss out on that sense of community?

Venting… but has anyone else been through this or is there something wrong with me?,"Technically I didn’t make it past the “probationary period.” It was just a barista job but not being able to keep even that makes me feel like garbage. 

They did kind of have a weird way of running things. We’d have monthly meetings with the general manager where we got feedback. In my first meeting I was too slow at doing dishes and was “talking to people at inappropriate times.” I put in the effort to fix both of these things and was told two days later that I was still talking to people at inappropriate times… so I made the effort to stop talking to coworkers unless they talked to me first and to politely tell them I’d talk to them later if I was in the middle of a task.

I also got written up for being late. Once I called ahead to let them know I would be late because my car was getting serviced and it ended up taking longer than expected. Another time I was less than five minutes late but didn’t call in because I was driving to work (I don’t have Bluetooth in my car). Prior to being written up I would show up ten minutes early to every shift. After being written up I made sure to get to work at least 15 minutes early to make sure it didn’t happen again.

Today I was let go because I still wasn’t fast enough at tasks- even though I’ve felt like I’ve gotten a lot faster. Apparently I also don’t retain info well, and it has made it difficult for me to follow their feedback and maybe instruction? Separately it was noted that I don’t work with enough “urgency.” When the shop is busy… the only things I was trained on (and allowed to do) were pour coffee, check people out, do dishes, and do closing chores and procedures…. I just… don’t know where I went wrong. I was trying so hard to be faster. I feel like such a failure.

My last job- which I was also fired from- overworked me and essentially wanted me to do three jobs at once (retail, social media, and managing a farm market). I hated that job and as a result would often be late. It was impossible to keep up with the tasks they asked me to and I had little to no instruction or training. My boss was also pretty cruel and treated me and everyone else like garbage. While I was aware that the job asked too much of me, and that the environment was bad I tried to take what I could from the experience after being fired and do better at my next job. As a result I tried really, really hard at this job and took everything they told and seriously and tried to apply all their feedback. 

I feel like every job is telling me I’m too slow or I’m not catching on and learning fast enough. I have a Master’s in English. I can’t find any jobs in my field. I almost feel like that doesn’t matter because I can’t even keep a minimum wage job. I tried so hard. I showed up and showed up EARLY. And ways tried to put my best foot forward and improve. But it wasn’t enough. Nothing I do seems to be enough and to be honest it’s heartbreaking. 

People always say don’t take what jobs say personally but when you keep getting the same notes over and over despite trying your best to improve in those areas it starts to feel like there’s something wrong with you.",1,1759895334.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

There may be security footage if you bribes the right guard, retention time there for desktop saved favorites may be longer than standard offical time.

At least I know half a dozen maintence team workers who for the coffee and donuts I already bought them for our meetings, would be inclined to just tell you the truth about the time I corrected a mistake in policy that became a whole to-do. 

I was conducting training from corporate about a very common mistake and it’s very simple fix, when a man got visibly upset, pointed at me and said “she can’t possibly know that, I mean look at her” **creep gestures in relative chest area with some gesturing to face cause makeup = dumb or something **

And I was so normalized being screamed at I just said no it’s okay let me pull up the website with the examples to explain. 

My mentor paused me in the hall later to ask me why I reacted like that. 

When I got my degree I knew my stuff and didn’t dress up. Dressing up then, didn’t undo any of that work I already did. No one had repo’d my time I’d spent in class or hours studying in some strange curled up at a desktop positions. 

I felt sorry for the dude.

A change that was a big legal to-do yet was so minor in every way imaginable. 

As vague as possible - it was a federal rule and something was painted the wrong color. Easy fix, like painfully easy. 

I felt really annoyed too because it just caused nothing but problems. 

I had guys who face palmed and cringed, turned away and were so uncomfortable. 

Not really the training environment I’d tried to build with free food and corporate credit card buys for new work stuff. 

Wasn’t afraid though. 

No one really could get past that, I didn’t cry or act afraid. Said I was too calm. 

Trauma makes you act some kinda way. 

For this situation I knew a few things so let’s start with a little bit about me, I know I can take a hit, I know how people are in front of others (oodles of witnesses glass conference room to boot in front 30+ pool cubie area), and from contract work in other industries more known for wild tempers (some places commonly) I found grown men in the workplace generally want to be heard — they don’t want physical altercation with the female staff 1/4 their size. 

I wasn’t afraid. 
I was exhausted by sexism. 
I was drained from men using threatening body language in the workplace to intimidate me out of relaying a fact. 

Worst part? I can give examples of simple issues like this being twisted by (from my perspective) adults behaving like you just asked to see if they did their homework before they play video games when they very obviously did not do it. 

Complete with “I should probably get that evaluated if I was a parent of that behavior” level temper tantrums disproportionate to the actual issue at hand. 

Sexisim is alive and exhausting. Yet you run into it enough you will forever get “um but like aren’t you like the only like thing in common with uhh these jobs so it’s gotta be a YOU problem” 

….

It’s a “I literally made myself homeless on at least two occasions because I won’t let my intelligence be erased to please the ego of some middle management idiot” and I would not have had to if these men could have “seen” the college degree, the absolutely tiny and nearly un-noticeable change yet THOUSANDS IN UNNECESSARY FINES IF NOTICED, and just been like “oh I did not know that” instead of turning it into a hill to die on.

My current situation is as follows: I’m male, 29 years old. I was very active in sports during my youth, but then I started using weed. After years of daily use (starting around age 23), I decided to quit about 30 days ago to improve my life, health, and mental clarity.

At first, weed was a pleasure, but after a while it became too much (paranoia, anxiety attacks, mental fog, and isolation). I really miss my “old self.”

At the same time, I’m juggling university assignments and work responsibilities, so I need to “function” again.

Here’s my current daily stack: 
•	Vitamin B complex 
•	Magnesium bisglycinate
 •	Creatine monohydrate
 •	Coffee 
•	Zinc bisglycinate 
•	Vitamin D3 + K2 
•	Multivitamin

I also have a history of depression. Since quitting cold turkey, I’ve been taking clonazepam (Klonopin) to help with anxiety, overthinking, and sleep. I also have CBD, which some friends recommended during withdrawal. I don’t drink alcohol at all.

My main goal: regain focus, motivation, and cognitive sharpness, the kind I had in my youth and early 20s, when I was full of energy and life.

TLDR: After almost 7 years of smoking weed, I quit 30 days ago and built a supplement stack to help my brain recover. Looking for input from the community on what might actually work for focus, motivation, and cognition.",11,1759894760.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False
1o101ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1o101ly/opening_a_coffee_shop_advice_needed/,Opening a coffee shop- advice needed,"So a small space just came available for rent in my town and I’m considering opening my own cafe (the shop is 1,100 sqft). The idea would be to have it a coffee shop by day (selling coffee, pastries, small food items, there is no kitchen) and then host community events by night (painting classes, book clubs, mommy & me classes, sourdough making classes etc). The space is currently a retail store, but also has a small coffee bar that sells pastries. They are SO loved by our community and we were all devastated to hear of its closing. 

Here’s where I come in: I’m in the hospitality industry and currently work events, weddings, etc. I’ve always dreamed of opening a cozy cafe where people in the community can gather, sip coffee, work and hangout with friends. I want to mix the two (coffee & community events) and bring the community together. 

My questions: I have no idea how profitable this can be, I’ve ran startup costs, operating costs, expenses etc but I have no clue for sure unless I just go for it, which is obviously scary. My monthly profits I calculated could be as low as $500 a month to as high as $5,000, depending on how well we do with coffee and events. 

Any advice is appreciated, I know my situation is unique but it’s important to note this is a great location, already has a good rep with the community, I can use the same roaster (who everyone loves) and it’s the only coffee shop in the town!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

That’s really it. I can believe it cus I lived with this pain daily for over two years now - my main symptom is excruciating like want to vomit and feel faint level pain in my bladder and urethra, like razor blades when peeing but 24/7. I am 30F, cross-posting

I foolishly cut gluten when trying to investigate this strange uti pain and/or recurrent uti actual infections for so long.. and voila! It all magically disappeared when I figured out it was gluten. 1.5 years of DAILY pain feeling like an umbrella was being shoved up my urethra everyday GONE after not eating gluten with days and lasting months?! Amazing.

I also struggled with constipation like going once every two weeks most of my life horribly…. Magically was going everyday within one week GF. I also looked so bloated people thought I was pregnant a lot…. Suddenly gone GF. My GERD got better too. My skin seemed clearer. Those things were all smaller to me in comparison to the UTI pain but were huge jarring “oh maybe this was the issue for who knows how long” moment for me. 

But then I couldn’t get tested since I didn’t know I needed to per my Dr and my own lack of knowledge (regret) but I found a great GI Dr who confirmed I have the gene for celiac and said I need to eat gluten again for 8 weeks and do bloodwork and biopsy. Either way I’m going back to GF.

So few weeks ago, I began eating normally.. the first day or so felt great. Totally gaslit myself - maybe it was in my  head, how could I have been right? I’m not a dr. I’ve seen about thirty drs and no one suggested gluten being the issue, I’m obviously just crazy and it’s in my head. Right?

Then days in, it all came crashing back. All back to the for crying helplessly on the floor in that same level of pain, burning urethra, sore bladder, body pain, now nerve pain???? I escaped after 1.5 years in my urethra. Total inflammation like the devil himself is holding a lighter to it. Then it eases for a few hours. Until the next day when I eat more gluten to fulfill the 8 weeks.. then it comes roaring back for several hours straight. Every day.

This is just a rant, I have no one in my life who understands. 

And the worst part is, when I did go gluten free for the 3 months I had no more urinary or bladder pain at all (minus gluten free bread caused it once??? Testing for yeast allergy now.) BUT I was near fainting, developed POTS 3 weeks into it(I know probably not related), was scared I was dying cus I kept getting faint and anemic but was not prior to quitting gluten so odd, my urine and bloodwork looked like starvation? I was scared I wasn’t getting enough carbs, yet I had potatoes everyday, gf pasta, gf bakery items, gf everything that had carbs still, like I ate Scharr at every meal, so much rice etc. No idea why my body reacted that way. But I always felt hungry no matter how much gluten free everything I was eating, for months. I basically binge ate non GF carbs so I don’t get it. I ate a ton of protein, and a buttload of fruits and vegetables daily. It all went away when I began the gluten challenge again within a day or two though and I finally didn’t feel like I was dying anymore. Why?!?! How?? 

I’m sorry as I know this is probably an annoying post. I’m 110% ranting cus I need to get this out once. I’m eating all my favorite foods cus I know even if celiac is negative I really can’t handle the pain and inflammation gluten is causing - which all began during intense trauma and worsened after a sudden loss and grief..I just want to feel safe in my body and eat and feel full and enjoy food. I know it’ll take time. I know everyone here has suffered and I’m not unique. I’m just so confused

The 1 thing I’ll never get is basically.. I was traumatized so badly from something shocking that happened in my personal life that I can’t eat croissants ever again?? In short that’s what happened (sorry sounds weird explaining vaguely) when it all began. And then - the person closest to me, my soulmate, I miss him every second, died unexpectedly and I can’t even eat croissants without getting a rash, UTI, and ulcers ????? With it all ramping up? 

The list of things I’ve done for 2 YEARS before figuring out gluten is honestly nuts from thousands on internal physical therapy, treating pudental nerve, 4 months straight of antibiotics,  my bf taking antibiotics also in case, ph balanced everything, probiotics, no sex (and including the last months of my bfs life - cus no one knew to test me for gluten or suggested eliminating), changing my iud not once but twice - double ouch, going on the pill, going off the pill, using estrogen cream, testing for every std on the planet and probably ones off of it if that was possible, traveled to the city and being treated by every floor of specialists at NYU repeatedly, doing the interstitial cystitis diet, cranberry pills powder and herbs, paying out of pocket monthly for a chronic uti specialist, quit coffee which I miss everyday.. Now in medical debt and broke before that tbh idk why I did half of these things but desperation. And I had to go into therapy when the pain level made me have unsafe thoughts, and a ton more random remedies I was told to do I can’t even think of.

Finally now a neurologist was also shocked no one did auto immune tests and ordered a ton, pending aside from the celiac testing in the near future with GI dr.

Thank you for anyone who read this and I’m sorry cus I know I’m complaining when I should be grateful that I know a cure for a bulk of my physical pain, I know a lot of people have it worse, and I really am grateful to know it’s the issue but just hate that I’m doing this all over again until December. I’m going to plan to actually talk to a nutritionist if I can with insurance to get help when I go gf again to prevent issues I hope

If anyone has any tips, advice, or ways to better manage this it will be so appreciated so so much. <3 to everyone who is here.",1,1759894533.0,Celiac,0,1.0,False

Hello all,

I am new to Starfield. I've owned it since release but due to PC requirements I didn't play much. I upgraded my PC and then forgot about the game. I restarted the game 2 years later and now I am addicted, especially with the shipbuilding! Hence it was only natural that I found this sub. 

This is an introductory interview, my OC, freelance journalist Noah Guillard, will go around the Settled Systems interviewing various pilots and their ships. This was my first shipbuild in the game, I think it turned out great for having limited resources.

This one-of-one creation, dubbed the Speedtail, was made by Constellation member and UC Vanguard Captain Julius Enoch. The Speedtail was primarily designed to hunt for Artifacts and take on the Crimson Fleet, requiring maneuverability and speed to outflank the enemy in precarious situations.

[UC Vanguard Captain Julius Enoch and The Speedtail](https://preview.redd.it/wn4kcyswwstf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=33292d014775dec9f3b123faf4f45de193f31352)

The Speedtail is a personal mix of an exploratory craft and a stealth fighter. It started its life as a Hopetech Watchdog but was quickly converted into the marvel that it is now. Julius dropped the bulky landing gear for a smaller (but still Hopetech-sourced) Hope 6 gearing attached to Stroud-Ekland engine bracers. The Hopetech front mounted cargo bay was replaced with a Taiyo Astroneering 200 rear-loading bay.

[The Taiyo Astroneering Rear-Loading Bay helps obtain a sleeker more compact design.](https://preview.redd.it/0akrhb42xstf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3fb432160f2791b7ea3d746e58ad1dad5fbaf97)

Equipped with four Reladyne White Dwarf 1020 engines on such a lightweight chassis allows the Speedtail to outmaneuver its enemy and reach topspeeds of 750m/sec while boosted. In the back is a Dogstar M20 Ulysses Helium-3 dual tank with a 70 gallon capacity fed through a Hopetech Radiator piping to a Deepcore branded Helios 300 Grav Drive capable of 23 Lightyears of jump.

[The Grav Drive mounted in the rear and the Dual Reladyne White Dwarf 1020 engines mounted on each side give this ship its name.](https://preview.redd.it/8e6zexyqxstf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b3619e256b74bfc3bc0648d58f4d819c00067a)

The ship is armed to the teeth with armaments capable of taking down any member of the Crimson Fleet that is in its path. Mounted on each side of the upper hab are dual BSI fabricated PBO-30 Auto Electron Beams and Shinigami Tsukisasu 13k Missile Launchers. Protecting everything is a Dogstar 30s Protector Shield Generator mounted to the top of the ship. Everything is powered by a Dogstar 134mm Toroidal Reactor placed between the Grav Drive and Fuel tanks. Every ship would be incomplete without some kind of way to carry all the space loot the pirates drop - Caravel V102 Cargo carriers are mounted on each side.

[Just enough cargo space and firepower for any exploratory force.](https://preview.redd.it/7573s9txxstf1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b628857d9c61b9dae3ff8df83f3c922fcccbbd3)

The aft-facing cargo bay opens up into a Hopetech control station; full of screens and equipped for a crew of four able to monitor the stars for potential Artifacts and any form of piracy. The Hopetech Armstrong 10 Cockpit is immediately forward from the control station with the captain's chair front and center flanked by two seats for co-pilots.

On the upper deck is a Hopetech fabricated all-in-one hab with sectioned living quarters and a kitchen. The kitchen is equipped with a full-size refrigerator and freezer combo, a three burner stove with a griddle top and an oven/broiler combo, deep twin faceted sinks, and a much needed coffee brewing machine. Across from the kitchen is a small table for dining. The living quarters feature twin bunkbeds and a spacious storage area with a half bath room.

**Interview:** I had the pleasure of sitting down and talking with the Creator and Captain of the Speedtail, Julius Enoch. He was sitting in the Sixth Spear on Mars at the time; enjoying a nice refreshing Pils style ale.

https://preview.redd.it/s6sozn2hxstf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=969a04a66c4330b4ec266a9164521d7beb617056

**Noah**: So Julius, tell me a little bit about yourself; You’re a part of the Vanguard. What made you want to join?  
  
**Julius**: Well I was born on New Atlantis. Not in any fancy apartment in the residential district but down in the Well. My parents weren’t the best off. Joining the vanguard was plain and simple. It gave me a way to move up the social ladder. There was a lot of tension after the Colony War. I was 11 when it ended; there was this need to make things right and still protect the United Colonies from threats like piracy or even another potential war.  
  
**Noah**: What made you want to build this ship?  
  
**Julius**:  My father worked at the Ship Port repairing freighters; as long as I can remember I’ve been around ships. Always watching them come in go even if I had to hide behind cargo crates to be close on the landing pad. So I always had a knack for ships and their parts. Obsessed. I mean completely obsessed over them. But I am also a member of Constellation so exploring the Systems with my colleagues and being comfortable while doing so is a major necessity. Recently though, there has been a surge in Piracy. The Crimson Fleet needs to be dealt with. We need to be fast and hit like a freight train when confronted. That's why I stuck with a Class-A ship. They’re smaller, sure, but when equipped right, they are just as effective as any other.

**Noah**: What inspired you to build the Speedtail?

**Julius**: Mainly, I was tired of flying around in an old Discovery-Class. So I bought another ship, it was a Rambler, suited for short-range reconnaissance. A bad buy. I have major buyers remorse with that one. So then I bought a Hopetech Watchdog and hated that too. So I dismantled the entire thing and used a variety of new parts. I wanted something fast, maneuverable, lightweight but could carry a decent amount of cargo and have nice quarters. I couldn’t sacrifice firepower though. That was potential. You never know when you’re going to reach a system and jump right into a dogfight.  
  
**Noah**: Tell me about the build process, what kind of limitations or challenges did you have?  
  
**Julius**: Mainly budget and staying within A-Class specs. My ideas began with something much larger. But as I kept pricing it out and designing it, it just kept getting more expensive. I had all kinds of habs attached to it. Engineering bay, control room, Captain’s quarters (you gotta fly in style), Crew Quarters, an armory, the works. All in all, it was going to be a three tiered ship, based off Taiyo habs. I changed course because, honestly, I did not need anything that big while sacrificing speed and maneuverability. So I cut back on it; drastically.  
  
**Noah**: How did you come up with the name?  
  
**Julius**: Well that's simple, look how slick the back looks; it's fast and sexy so it needed to sound the part.

**Noah**: Last question; are you going to build more ships?

**Julius**: Definitely. Its in my blood. We have work to do before that but maybe next time we see each other I’ll have my dream M-Class.

**Noah**: Julius, thanks for taking the time and showing me your starship.

**Julius**: It’s my pleasure, Noah.",1,1759894520.0,ShipandPilot,1,1.0,False

I thought moving out of my parents’ fancy house was gonna be this big, empowering moment, but now I’m just stressed about rent, utilities, and these stupidly expensive tickets I bought to impress my boyfriend, who, by the way, didn’t even seem *that* excited about the show. I’m sitting there, bawling my eyes out at the emotional climax of *Hamiton*, and he’s just scrolling on his phone like it’s another Tuesday. I’m out here investing in *us*, and he’s too invested in his silly little gay comics?

Goodbye my amber glowing heart
Goodbye to the Forever we never even had the chance to  truly start,

Goodbye to our long talks,
Goodbye to all of our inspirations, motivations and all of those aspirations,
Goodbye to my silent dreams of a happy old couple going for quiet walks,

Goodbye warm brown eyes with that charming spark
Those eyes that looked at me like I was your beautiful girl 
The shining star in your dark

Goodbye shared nights of rooms filled with laughter and
Glowing smiles upon your face

Goodbye to our sanctuary, our paradise away from the rat race

Goodbye perfectly made fires and all of the cozy nights

1o0zx1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowYourTelegram/comments/1o0zx1f/here_are_8_key_insights_you_must_know_from_the/,Here are 8 key insights you must know from the latest Pavel Durov and Lex Fridman Interview,"# 1. Freedom Comes from Childhood Experiences

Pavel learned about freedom early by moving from the Soviet Union to Italy at age 4. He saw firsthand how societies with freedom offer more opportunities, ideas, and abundance than those without. This experience shaped his core belief that **""freedom matters more than money""** and that the biggest enemies of freedom are fear and greed.

# 2. Extreme Self-Discipline Through Abstinence

Pavel has avoided alcohol, tobacco, coffee, pills, and drugs for over 20 years. His philosophy: these substances damage your brain (your most valuable tool) for temporary pleasure. He learned at 11 that alcohol literally paralyzes and kills brain cells, making it counterproductive for long-term success.

# 3. Minimal Phone Usage Despite Running Telegram

Ironically, the founder of one of the world's largest messaging apps barely uses phones. Pavel avoids phones except to test Telegram features because he wants to control what enters his mind, not let algorithms or others decide what's important. He believes constant connectivity makes you less productive.

# 4. Daily Physical Discipline Routine

Pavel does **300 push-ups and 300 squats every morning** plus gym sessions 5-6 times per week. He views exercise not just for physical health but as training for self-discipline - the most important ""muscle"" you can develop. Physical activity also improves brain efficiency by increasing oxygen and sugar flow to the brain.

# 5. Telegram's Lean Engineering Philosophy

Telegram operates with only **40 core engineers** serving over 1 billion users. Pavel believes more employees often decrease quality because people spend time coordinating instead of building. Small teams are forced to automate processes, making systems more scalable, efficient, and reliable than manual management.

# 6. Bulletproof Privacy Protection

Telegram's data is encrypted and distributed across multiple countries with decryption keys split between locations. **No single government or entity can access user data**, and **no Telegram employee can read private messages**. Pavel states they have never shared a single private message with any government and would shut down rather than compromise this principle.

# 7. Strategic Long-term Thinking

Pavel consistently chooses long-term benefits over short-term pleasure. Whether avoiding sugar, alcohol, or porn, his philosophy is to analyze the root cause of problems rather than masking symptoms. He views most quick fixes (like pills for headaches) as addressing consequences rather than causes.

# 8. Information Curation and Independent Thinking

Pavel emphasizes the importance of curating information sources rather than being ""slaves to AI recommender systems"". He advises finding a unique niche to master rather than following what everyone else does. To be successful, you must be different and avoid consuming the same information as the masses.

1o0zvuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1o0zvuc/a_black_femmes_guide_to_baltimore/,A Black Femme's Guide to Baltimore,"Hi all //round 2 to fix the formatting.

I put together a list of places in Baltimore *City* including restaurants and cafes, venues, shops, and cultural spaces that I'm willing to share on Reddit, are Black-owned, and/or places where I consistently feel comfortable, affirmed, and able to enjoy myself as a Black, alternative, professional, femme, millennial who's not a Baltimore native and who's into arts, culture, and community.

Most places in this list are Black, other non-white, and/or woman-owned or have a strong Black presence. Some aren't Black-owned or are mostly patronized by white people, but they still feel communal and at ease. They are places where I don't feel on guard or annoyed about the vibe; I can just be.

I made this list because although Baltimore is a majority-Black city, recommendations on this sub often reflect Reddit's demographics more than the city's. Common recs typically highlight places mostly patronized and enjoyed by white people. That said, this isn't a general ""best of"" list. It also isn't a statement that other businesses aren't worth checking out or enjoying if you're interested. It's simply a curated guide centered on a (my) Black experience of Baltimore.

**To other Black folks (of all backgrounds)**: what are your go-to Baltimore spaces that feel consistently comfortable, affirming, and enjoyable?

**To non-Black readers**: enjoy the list, but please hold back from recommending places based only on what you've seen or heard secondhand.

My hope is that this thread can serve as a resource built from Black people's lived experience in Baltimore.

I got so humbled hearing that. Then he asked me for perfume, I gave him amazon link as well as community seller number. And one thing in the end he was repeating “beta mujhe galat mat samjna” few times ( context: he was muslim, and I looked hindu to him ig ) I assured him it was nice meeting you and got so glad to receive a compliment out of nowhere.

1o0zv1e,https://i.redd.it/00o469uk4ttf1.png,"From 2,704 Ads to 1 Insight: Belonging Beats Comfort","**TL;DR:**  Analyzed 2,704 Starbucks FB ads (Jun–Oct ’25). Most emphasize **personal comfort**. We then **produced the 20s spot ourselves** in Sora 2 to test a different emotion: *belonging*. 

**Why we did this**  
We wanted a repeatable way to go from data → emotion → ad concept, without outsourcing creative. Adology for the data, Sora 2 for the film, and both in-house.

**How we worked**

* Pulled **2,704** ads into Adology; parsed frames, captions, CTAs.
* Emotional pattern: **Comfort (10/10), Happiness (9/10), Relatability (8/10)**.
* Common themes: “better day,” premium convenience, morning ritual.
* Takeaway: brands lean hard into cozy, me-time narratives.

**Whitespace we found**  
Lots of self-care/indulgence. **Almost no “connection” or cross-cultural empathy.** For a global brand that sells community, that’s a blind spot.

**Core insight**  
Travelers want authenticity *and* comfort. When you’re abroad, you don’t just want coffee, you want to feel **understood**.

**The concept: “However You Say It: Island Edition”**

* **Format:** 20s commercial
* **Setting:** Starbucks Bali
* **Beat:** A traveler mispronounces an order; the barista gets it—shared smile, shared humanity.
* **Line:** “However you say it, you belong here.”
* **Why different:** Flips the frame from comfort *within* to connection *between*.

**Production notes (we built it ourselves)**

* We produced the spot end-to-end: storyboards, prompting, shot design, edit, sound.
* Used **Sora 2** as the “camera,” not a template—handheld feel, micro-beats (hesitation → recognition → warmth).
* Goal: hyper-real texture that reads like live action, not AI-gloss.

**What we learned**  
Data doesn’t replace creativity; it **reveals the gap** your idea should fill. From 2,704 comfort-led ads, the missing emotion was **belonging**. That single insight reframed the story.

# Discussion (would love feedback)

* Best **low-budget validation** before media spend: whitelisting via creators, small geo test, or brand lift poll?
* For founders using AI video: where did **production quality** vs **speed** actually move ROI for you?

I initially thought it was for a WFH position as my friend who used to work here said so, but apparently new hires are now required to report to the office. Which was okay with me. My previous job was an office job and I loved it.

It was the president who interviewed me. He seems like a nice and understanding guy. He works abroad, where the main office is. He said the current set up has 4 desks in a shared office space with other companies. And that there is free coffee in the pantry. He told me the current office is temporary as they are looking for a bigger one to accommodate everyone as they are slowly getting the other employees back to the office. He told me that there was one new person hired around this time. This all led me to believe that there are more people in the office. He talked about licenses and that they don't use cracked software among other things. I asked if they have training programs as I told him I don't have experience in X software and he said not to worry cause they do have training programs.

So I started working here in August and well... It's not what I was expecting. It's a 2.5mx3m room with barely enough space for 3 desks. It feels very claustrophobic. My first day was literally just me for most of the day cause the other new hire I mentioned was on leave that time. Apparently, no one else reports to the office besides the 2 of us. The manager just dropped off my computer and left. There are no windows. It's so cold all the time from the centralized AC. The other new hire got back a week after and we're okay but we don't talk much. There's been another new hire after me. But the office still feels so claustrophobic and isolating. I thought the incentive of working in an office is collaboration and resources, which I don't feel I'm getting. I was thinking I'd at least have a senior here to guide me, but nope, just a bunch of new hires. And the ""training"" was just a Teams call of being given a list of what to research about the software plus an exercise, with no actual guidance.

The manager came by to drop something off my first month and told us that if we feel cramp, we can walk around outside to the pantry cause we have access there, but no access to the coffee and water. Even though I'd been getting water for weeks. She said it should be okay cause no one complained and we haven't been reprimanded. She said access to coffee and water is an additional charge on their rent.

I don't think the President has actually seen this place and he asked me on Teams if the space is big. He also asked how the coffee was. I explained what the manager said and he was confused cause he said he was told by the manager that we do have access. So he apologized and the manager called later in the day to say we now have access.

Another issue was I needed to use a software, and the project lead sent me a link to a cracked version. I thought it was a test. No, he was serious. I don't think the president knows. (Edit: It isn't the main software we use, more like a supplementary one. The main ones are licensed, but still so sketchy)

I just have a lot of concerns and feel in a way, catfished by this company. I could raise my concerns to the manager or lead, but they're very well aware of it anyway. WIBTA if I raise these concerns to the president? I feel like he doesn't know what's going on in the office here.

I understand if y'all need to delete this for being out of place.

I'm gonna be super vulnerable here because this has been on my mind for the last couple of years and it's a really difficult thing to get to the bottom of just searching around online. Basically - am I too old to start trying to do musical theatre again professionally?

**The long story:** I've been a dancer since I was 3 years old, my first-ever dream job to be a Rockette. I got really into musical theatre when I was a teenager, and started auditioning for the musicals at my high school, but was never really cast as a speaking/solo vocalist part because my school's program wasn't awesome and the ensemble always needed strong dancers. Also, my voice is fine but there were always better, more confident singers to pick from. I decided to go to a school where I could minor in dance for college, but fell out of that pretty quickly because I really didn't get along with the other dancers in my (very small) school. I acted in a couple of plays back then, but ultimately fell out of performing.

After college, I moved to DC and sort of just fell into the nonprofit rat race (a very specific kind of vibe that is similar to the corporate rat race only you make like half the money and everyone makes you feel bad when you don't want to work because it's ""for the mission"" etc), and have been low-grade miserable about lots of parts of my life for years. Shortly after the pandemic, when I was around 26 years old, I realized that I missed performing and started looking into my local community theatre scene. I got cast in one show and had the time of my life, and started remembering how much joy I found in performing and got the itch again. I've simultaneously been in an online grad program throughout the last few years, so it was only a year later that I got to try my hand at another show, where I was cast and given a (small) solo vocal part. I've just sort of realized that this is really the piece that has been missing all these years, and part of me really wants to take the next couple of years to really try and make my way from my current 9-5 (which I really can't stand) to a world where I'm a full-time perfomer who maybe slings coffee or something on the side to keep financially stable.

My thing is - I'm 29 now. I've spent the last couple of years really becoming inspired by the performers I see on social media who talk about coming back after falling out of love with theatre, like Kayla Moore, and then finding out that they're like, 3 years younger than I am and they went back to performing like 3 years before that, and then I think about what it would mean to even be starting to find stability in performing at the ripe old age of 32 and it feels so precarious and silly and then I tell myself it might just be best if I try to keep this a hobby and make peace with the fact that I hate my day job, but honestly, the thought of that is so depressing to me.

I mention living in DC because I also don't drive, and there isn't a ton of opportunities to perform for pay in the city for a non-equity actor (as far as I'm aware). Getting out to Virginia or Maryland for a gig would be nearly impossible, and I don't think that learning to drive, at least while I live here, is in the cards for me. I also haven't mentioned my vocal skill much, because I think it leaves a lot to be desired at the moment. All of my communtiy theatre friends who dabble in professional work say I sound ""fine, but it's obvous you aren't trained,"" which both drives me insane and lets me know that I need to take some vocal lessons for a long while to even get to a point where I could be considered professionally.

This all seems like a monster - and again, I'm 29. I know the whole, like, *if you don't start today, time will still pass and then you'll just be 32 and have not even tried* thing, but the thing is that I really do want to be pragmatic with this. Do I have a chance at getting anywhere? Is this something I need to put to rest at least from a professional perspective?

I don't need to be on Broadway. But is it reasonable to try for something that might yeild opportunities for a national tour or regional casting? How rare is it for someone to start in earnest this old? Are my bones going to wither away when I hit 33 so all of this will be for nuaght? I would love any and all of your thoughts - be gentle, but not unrealistic with me, please.

**TL;DR:** I'm a 29-year-old who lives in DC who spent the first 20 years of her life dancing in a very competitive environment and burnt out at age 21. I started doing community theatre again like 2 years ago and I love it and I lowkey hate a lot of parts about my life and I'm wondering if it's too late for me to really give it a go at being a professional performer.

Conviction 

- Purple Beanie

- Cowboy Scarf

- Peppermint Tea

- Matcha Latte

(The game says they should crit so I have them crit stuff that also boosted bulk, I'm assuming their passive is a flat +25% final crit chance and not a 1.25 mult, this slot used to be a pain because I thought it was great but according to the one tier list I found it's the worst tank in the game, so good job me, I thought the spread damage was worth it)

Apathy

- Hibiscus Flower

- Chunky Knit Scarf

- Iced Coffee

- Leather Journal

(This one is just all over the place, idk how to build attackers in this game, do I fully ignored bulk and just pray nothing has AoE? Do I keep items on hand specifically for when something has AoE? The stun is nice tho)

Sanctimony

- Spider Hat

- Aqua Spiked Collar

- Spider Dumbbell 

- Stress Ball 

(This pet feels like it does all the heavy lifting, be it picking up kills on frail enemies past their tanks or just having great damage output, but I don't know how much of them being epic is compensating for their bulk being completely uninvested, I assume I should just max out offenses but idk what I do about AoE then)

Wonder

- Peony Wrath

- Diamond Collar

- Skinny Vanilla Latte

- Gua Sha

(I have not even the slightest hint on how I should build healers)

I have a sonder but even tho they're an epic healer they feel worse unless the enemy specifically utilizes debuffs or has weak spread attackers that can get outhealed because wonder having targeted healing that keeps your tank alive more than the spread heal does just feels so much better, once my tank dies im usually about to lose anyways cause none of my fighters can take many hits

Basically my questions are

Is 2 fighters one tank one healer even a good team structure? I know I had to switch that up when the floor 160 boss targeted two pets at once so I used two tanks so idk how often the game will challenge this lineup and if I should even use it

How do I correctly build my gear? I don't really know what stats to focus on, although I would assume for tanks and fighters just maxing survivability/damage would be best, I would still like confirmation, and I just dunno how to build healers

How do I get legendary equipment? Does it have any prerequisites from spawning or is it just from using keys to refight bosses, and can I improve my odds in any way

How do I get any Uber stuff? I'm not expecting to get any of it for a loooong time but asked how I get it can't hurt, is it just a very low chance to get from a pull or do I somehow unlock it after getting a pet with a higher form

Am I missing something about events? It says I'm on reward tier1 so I assume my rewards are so bad because I'm new, but 2 eggs feels extremely low as the maximum event reward, furthermore actually fighting the legendary doesn't even give their eggs which makes this feel even more pointless

Are there any epic pets that are particularly good while I wait for getting my first legendary? Or just in general, is there something like a wiki or a community tier list that isn't outdated (I don't know how often this game gets balance changes but I can't find the age of the tier list I found online so I'm assuming the worst) where I can learn what pets are good, I don't understand enough of the mechanics to judge this accurately myself 

And lastly, I got two epic metal fighters today and I wanted to replace Apathy with one of them, but I don't know which is better, paranoia seems a lot better than desperate but I figured I would ask people who know more than me

I hope all my badly structured yap didn't put people off of reading this, and if You just have general advice on what to do that isn't related to my questions, I would still very much appreciate it, and uh thank you if you actually read this to the end :3

We've not known eachother super long but the boundaries and friend zone are 100% clear because I made sure to be blunt and he said he understood. He came over at about 0100 which is my usual time to hang out with people since I work an evening schedule. So its not weird in my household. We played uno and phase ten and watched a movie. We smoked a bit of weed as well. I only took 3 hits and it was a preroll that I bought. It was my own stash because I dont take drugs from others ever for safety reasons obviously. 

We had pizza from cottage Inn and just ginger ale. We'll I had a terrible reaction to the high I got. Ive NEVER been that high in my life let alone actually high from 3 hits if a medium sized blunt. I ended up passing out. When I woke up on the sofa laying down, it was about 0400 so I slept almost an hour when I came to. I was still disoriented and asked him to leave because I was nauseous. Then I proceeded to violently throw up all over the floor. Lovely. 

2 days later my roommate asked me why id left Cialis (a drug for erectile dysfunction typically) on her coffee table in the livingroom. I was confused because I hadn't. I am currently not sleeping around either so there's no reason itd be mine. As it turns out, it was my friends. I texted and asked him and he admitted and made a million excuses and then apologized. I was so heavily disturbed because the kind he had is prescription only (it says so on the pack) and is a 4 pack. There was only 1 left. Id complained the day prior to my roommate that I was bleeding more than I had been previously. For back story, I got an iud 7 days prior and was bleeding on and off lightly eith very little pain. But I complained id been very heavily bleeding and had a bad headache the day I woke up after my night with my friend. She and I are concerned that he may have drugged me?

A few weeks ago I decided to make a first deep dive into Middle Eastern scents and bought 13 samples from Hyggescent.  I was very impressed both with Hyggescent (generous decant size, fair prices, everything was packaged well and I received my order in less than a week) and with the fragrances I got.  While I assume some of my decants may have come from bottles that could have already been aged/macerated, all 13 of them were pretty smooth and none of them reeked of alcohol.  They’re much better than I was expecting!

Here are my reviews:

Lattafa Angham: 9/10 

Short Summary: Cozy, Sophisticated, Expensive Smelling 

Gorgeous take on Burberry Goddess that outperforms the original.  I’m seriously impressed with this one.  It’s deeper and smoother, with a slightly more boozy vanilla note and  with more cocoa in the dry down.  I also feel like there might be a little patchouli or something similar, as it reminded me as much of Mon Guerlain (which has patchouli) as it does Goddess.  Lasts twice as long on my skin as Goddess (which disappears on me after ~5 hours).


Khadlaj Cream Velvet: 6.5/10

Short Summary: Sweet Milky Vanilla

This is a Bianco Latte dupe, but I’ve never smelled the original so I can’t comment on its accuracy.  It’s a very creamy vanilla scent, making me think of custard or ice cream.  There is something a little plasticky in the opening but that went away fast.  It’s a nice fragrance, but I didn’t love it.  It’s a little too one note for me.  Good perframce, lasted 8-10 hours.


Maison Alhambra Decadent Dream: 8.5/10 

Short Summary: Stylish, Edgy Fruity Floral

Supposedly a dupe of Amouage Guidance but this is another dupe I haven’t smelled the original for.  So I have no idea if this is a good dupe or not, but it is seriously pretty and I got compliments wearing it.  It’s a very complex fruity floral, starting with Pear and Hazelnut in the opening before turning into a peachy floral with saffron and sandalwood nuances.  It’s rich and sweet without being too sweet. Amazing performance too as I could still smell it on my skin after 16 hours.


Lattafa Whipped Pleasure: 6/10

Short Summary:  Delicious yet off putting

This was probably the least successful out of the 13 perfumes I ordered.  The opening smells like salted caramel, popcorn and whipped cream which was delicious, but underneath it had a burnt and bitter note that I found really offputting.  I could only smell it if I had my wrist close to my skin though and it went away in the dry down, so it didn’t completely ruin the fragrance but it did slightly spoil the opening which was way more interesting than the dry down.  After 30 minutes or so, this fragrance lost the caramel and popcorn and started to smell like whipped cream and clean musk.  Which is nice but boring.  Weak projection once the opening passed and mid-longevity, about 5-6 hours.



Lattafa Choco Overdose: 10/10

Short Summary: The name fits!  Pure chocolatey goodness

This is so good.  I have been on the hunt for a rich chocolately scent, and this delivered in full.  It’s what I wanted Chocolate Greedy and Choco Musk to be.  To me this smells like a cup of French hot chocolate- the kind that’s (for me anyway!) too rich and thick to drink as a beverage but is excellent for dunking pastries into.   I will definitely be buying a full bottle as I will love this scent to cuddle with on cold days.  Lasted about 8 hours.


Lattafa Cookie Crave 8/10

Short Summary: Cookies and Cream

This is a photorealistic scent portrait of an Oreo cookie.  In the opening, it’s all about the chocolate biscuit part, with a dark and almost salty cocoa that smells dry and a little powdery just like with an Oreo.  After 10-15 minutes the vanilla and lactonic notes bloom, adding the cream filling and an accompanying glass of milk to the picture.  Very delicious and cozy, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  My only complaint is that this scent stays closer to the skin than I’d like.  Lasts about 7 hours on my skin.  


Lattafa Victoria: 8.5/10

Short Summary: Sweet Lemony Clouds

Beautifully fluffy lemony vanilla.  The notes list Lemon Meringue Pie, and I definitely get that as the airy quality of this scent definitely calls to mind a big sugary cloud of meringue.  I can also detect some milky notes and some subtle floral nuisance that make it feel a little more grounded and sophisticated.  It’s supposed to be a dupe of D&G Devotion which I’ve tested but don’t own, and I do think this is a close sister to that.  Lasts 7-8 hours. 


Maison Alhambra Decadent Wonder: 9.5/10

Short Summary: Smells elegant, soft and feminine

This fragrance is a delightful journey.  So well blended with several distinct stages that it felt I was experiencing new notes every time I sniffed.  I think it’s supposed to be a dupe of Amouage Love Delight but I can’t speak to that.  It opens as a soft and creamy floral, with vanilla, jasmine and heliotrope being the most dominant.  After 30 minutes or so I start smelling orange and ginger, adding some spice and brightness.  Finally an hour later I start to smell cacao, raw almond, suede and something softly earthy.  It’s absolutely beautiful.  This fragrance is so soft yet complex, sweetly feminine and so goddamn pretty.  It’s the sort of scent I’d wear to meet people I wanted to impress. Lasted about 8 hours with decent projection.  


Lattafa Her Confession 6/10

Short Summary: Smells like dryer sheets

This one didn’t work for me.  There’s nothing wrong with it, it’s completely inoffensive, but it’s absolutely not my style.  To me this is a clean laundry scent with background notes of milk, vanilla, coconut and jasmine. It’s very soft, very powdery and musky.  Scent is subtle and stays really close to the skin.  This lasts at least 6 hours, but I showered before it wore off so I can’t speak to its full potential.


Zimaya Zukhruf Pink 7/10

Short Summary:  Creamy Fruity Floral with Almond

Pretty!  I bought this decant because someone said it smelled similar to the fragrance in the Eva NYC strength hair care line which I’m obsessed with.  This sadly isn’t a dupe to that (though I do smell some similarities!), but it’s very pretty nonetheless the less.  It smells like Strawberry flavored Pez and Marizpan in the opening before becoming more floral and woody in the dry down.   Medium project and longevity,  I get about 7 hours with this. 


Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa 9.5/10

Short Summary: Dark Rich and and Mysterious

This to me smells like black coffee spiked with a good quality spiced rum. It’s dark, boozy and spiced with cinnamon and cardamom and is very lightly sweet.  Straight down the line unisex, leaning neither masculine or feminine.  Crazy good performance.  It barely faded on my skin after 14 hours and maintained good projection.  


Lattafa Artisan Ethnique 10/10

Short Summary: Utterly decadent and delicious. 

Another boozy, coffee scent, but this one is much sweeter and more feminine than Khamrah Qahwa.  With its strong vanilla, rum, cocoa and coffee notes, I smelled like I had doused myself in Kahlua liqueur and it was utterly delicious.  Great projection and longevity.  I will definitely be purchasing a full bottle, as I want to bathe in this scent.


Zimaya Tiramisu Coco 8/10

Short Summary: Delicious! Name fits the scent.

The third of my 3 boozy, sweet coffee scents and this one is the most gourmand of the 3.  It definitely smells like tiramisu with creamy vanilla, milk, pastry, coffee and amaretto notes. There’s even a bit of a cocoa powder in the opening.  This lasts for about 2 hours before the coffee and cocoa fade and the vanilla in this scent really shines.  A coworker told me my office smelled like cake at that point.  Great projection and pretty good longevity, about 8 hours.

I just wanted to rant about this brand as they recently held a ""morning walk + coffee event"" on our Country / City . I feel like they just allowed ""influencers"" on this event, like for people with more than 10k followers on IG. 

Before the event, they announced and posted a link where you can sign up for this event. And as an avid fan who purchased a lot of their bags and pouches, I was very disappointed when I didn't get the cut. I remember them posting the link for registration and I saw it fast. It's like less than 2 minutes (no joke) and hurriedly registered, so I was a bit hopeful that I'll be able to join it as it's first come first serve basis, or something like that.

I always have latest alerts / notifications on so I can see their latest updates, new products— long story short, I didn't get the cut and it feels like they already have a list of attendees prior to sending out links.

They just got my info, and I feel robbed of my data (lol).

To brands like this, please stop making your customers hopeful that you really have an event for ""everyone"" when in reality you already have your ""influencer"" attendees that, idk maybe, doesn't really know your brand and just in it for the freebies.

Honestly I was willing to pay for it if the event was something you need to pay a registration fee for.

The smell of burnt toast and cigarettes was how most of my mornings began.
Zula sat at the table, robe half-open, hair wild, smoke curling from the side of her mouth like punctuation. The news droned on the tiny holo screen footage of patrols, speeches, propaganda. She ignored all of it.

I poured coffee, trying not to think about how much my hands still shook when they were empty. The healer’s bandages were gone, but their memory wasn’t.

“It’s tonight,” I said finally.

“What is?” she muttered, flicking ashes into a chipped cup.

“My ceremony.”

She raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. “The big fancy one? Where they pin a shiny medal on your chest and pretend they didn’t almost get you killed last month?”

I sighed. “You’re unbelievable.”

“I’m retired,” she said flatly. “And I don’t go to those circus shows anymore.”

“It’s not a circus, Ma. It’s—”

“Politics,” she interrupted. “Dressing up war with applause.”

The silence stretched between us. I stirred sugar into my coffee just to have something to do.

“You could still come,” I tried again. “Just this once.”

Zula looked at me, the smoke veiling her expression. “For what? So they can parade my son around like a trophy? So Almair can smile and say how proud he is of the woman who trained his newest golden dog?” She snorted. “Pass.”

Her words hit harder than she knew. Maybe she did know.

“It’s different for me,” I said quietly. “This… this means something.”

She looked at me then, long and slow, eyes that had seen too much. “If it really means something, you don’t need me in the audience to clap for it.”

I nodded, but something inside me folded in half.
She reached for the pack again, then hesitated. “Zenos.”

“Yeah?”

“Try not to let the shine blind you.”

I almost smiled. “You always know how to kill the mood.”

“That’s my job,” she said, lighting another cigarette. “Go on, brat. Be the hero they want. Just remember who you are when the lights turn off.”

I finished my coffee, the bitterness lingering longer than the warmth. When I stood to leave, she didn’t look up, just waved a hand. “Don’t get burned alive in your own spotlight.”

I laughed once, without humor, and teleported away.

The city looked softer from up here.
The Mirante stretched over the rooftops, glass and wind and distance turning chaos into something almost peaceful. Elis leaned on the railing, black hair dancing with the breeze, sunlight catching the edges of her pale face. Her eyes those impossible blue eyes found me before I even spoke.

“You’re late,” she said, smiling.

“Blame the toast,” I said. “And my mother’s philosophy on breakfast and disappointment.”

She laughed, the sound cutting through the noise of the city below. “You two are the same person.”

“Blasphemy,” I said, stepping beside her.

For a while, we just watched. The traffic looked like veins of light, slow and rhythmic. The city never slept it just changed dreams.

“So,” she said eventually, “big night?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Golden Cape. Finally.”

She turned toward me, eyes searching. “You don’t sound happy.”

“I am. I think.” I ran a hand through my hair. “It’s just… different without Hugo. Without her there.”

“Elis exhaled softly. “My mother’s been distant too. She’s always working, always planning. I barely see her anymore. It’s like she’s somewhere else even when she’s home.”

“She’s trying,” I said. “Sônia’s a visionary. Maybe she just… believes too much in the future she wants.”

Elis’s smile faded. “Yeah. Maybe.” Her voice dropped. “Sometimes I don’t even know what’s right anymore, Zenos. My father says one thing, my mother says another. Every mission feels like we’re cleaning the same mess they caused.”

I nodded slowly. “I know the feeling. Lately I’m not even sure who the good guys are.”

She looked at me. “And yet you still want gold.”

“I have to,” I said. “Because if I stop moving, I start thinking. And if I start thinking, I start doubting. I can’t afford that right now.”

Elis touched my face gently, fingers cool against the heat rising behind my eyes. “Then don’t do it for them. Do it for you.”

Her thumb brushed my jaw. “You deserve this, Zenos.”

I caught her hand and pressed it to my lips. “You’re too good to me.”

“I know,” she said, smiling again.

We kissed. The kind that doesn’t rush, that stretches time until it forgets to move. For a moment, the city disappeared. The noise, the doubts, the ghosts gone. Just her, and the taste of hope.

When we finally pulled apart, I whispered, “I wish you could be there tonight.”

“Me too,” she said. “But I’ll be watching.”

Her eyes lingered on mine, and I could tell she meant more than that. Watching not the ceremony, but me.

When I teleported away, the wind still smelled like her perfume.

The locker room always smelled like metal and sweat and nerves. I’d just finished lacing my boots when the door swung open and James Bardos strode in like he owned the place. Maybe he did.

“Golden boy,” he said, grinning. “You look almost respectable for once.”

“Trying,” I said, unsure if I should salute or laugh.

He tossed me a towel. “Heard you’ve been healing up well. Word travels fast when someone catches Almair’s eye.”

I shrugged. “Luck, maybe.”

James chuckled. “Luck doesn’t make golden capes. Obedience does.” He leaned against the locker beside me, voice lowering. “Speaking of which got a small favor to ask.”

I froze halfway through tying my glove. “A favor?”

“Nothing big. Just… assistance.” He folded his arms. “Almair wants me to oversee a little side project training enhancements. Controlled augmentations. He specifically requested you.”

“Me?”

“Your mother’s old ability,” he said smoothly. “You inherited the core, right? Amplification through proximity.”

“Still learning control,” I admitted.

“Perfect,” he said, smiling. “We’ll start small. Volunteers, all cleared by the board. You give them a push, see what happens. Call it a mission, keep it quiet.”

It sounded strange, but his tone was calm, confident. The kind of confidence that rearranges your doubts before you can name them.

“Almair really said that?” I asked.

“Word for word,” James said without blinking. “You’re part of something bigger now, Zenos. You’re not just muscle you’re legacy.”

The word legacy hit deep.

He clapped my shoulder. “You’ve got what it takes to go far, maybe even sit in one of the council seats someday. People like us—we rise fast when we stop asking questions.”

I smiled weakly. “I’ll try not to disappoint.”

“That’s the spirit.”

He straightened, fixing his collar. “See you on the stage tonight, kid. Try not to faint when they put the gold on you.”

When he left, the room felt smaller. His words lingered like smoke sweet, poisonous, believable.

I looked at my reflection in the locker mirror.
Same eyes. Same scars. Different man staring back.

⸻

The Grand Hall of the Association gleamed like a cathedral of glass and pride. Spotlights poured from above, reflecting off hundreds of medals and capes. Reporters whispered. The crowd shimmered.

I stood in line with five others—all chosen for gold. My heart hammered like it wanted out.

Zula wasn’t there.
Neither was Hugo.
Only Elis, far at the back, her blue eyes shining through the blur of faces.

“Candidates,” Almair’s voice thundered from the podium, deep and polished. “Tonight, we welcome new protectors of order. Symbols of strength, vision, and evolution.”

Applause erupted. Cameras flashed. I forced my breath steady.

When my name was called, the noise blurred into silence. I walked forward. Almair’s hand steady, deliberate placed the gold across my shoulders.

“For valor and loyalty,” he said.

The fabric was heavier than I expected. Maybe that was the weight of everything it meant and everything it didn’t.

As I turned to face the crowd, I caught sight of Sônia standing near the council section. Her eyes met mine. She nodded once, sharp and knowing.

The world clapped. I smiled because I was supposed to.

When the ceremony ended, people surrounded me congratulations, laughter, flashbulbs. Through the blur, a hand landed on my shoulder.

James.

He leaned close, voice low enough for only me. “Welcome to the team, Golden Cape.”

His smile was warm. His eyes weren’t.

I wanted to feel pride.
All I felt was the echo of Zula’s warning.

Try not to let the shine blind you.

But as the lights blazed and the applause rolled over me like thunder, I realized it already had.",3,1759893328.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

Ever hit that midday slump when you feel like a zombie? 🧟‍♀️ You know, when your brain is foggier than a London morning, and even the thought of another task feels like climbing Everest? Yeah, I've been there, too. It’s crazy how quick it can happen! One minute you're cruising through the morning, and the next, you’re staring blankly at your screen, contemplating life choices… or napping under your desk!

But fear not, my friends! You don’t need another cup of coffee (though, let's be real, who doesn’t love a good coffee?). I’ve got a nifty little trick that can recharge your brain in just **10 minutes**. Here’s how I reboot my mental state without the jitters:

### **1. Step Away from the Screen 🖥️❌**

- Seriously, get up! A change of scenery does wonders.
- Take a quick **walk around** your space (or outside if you can).
- Bonus points if you can get some fresh air! 🌤️

### **2. Breathe Like You Mean It 🧘‍♂️**

- A few deep breaths can do more than you think. Inhale for a count of 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4. Repeat until your mind feels lighter.
- This isn’t just “hippie stuff”—it’s science! Deep breathing actually increases oxygen flow to your brain. Who knew?

### **3. Stretch it Out 🧘‍♀️**

- Take a minute to do some light stretches. Seriously, your muscles are probably as tight as yours goals were last year. 😂
- Not sure what to do? Try touching your toes or reaching for the ceiling. Heck, do a little dance if you feel it! 

### **4. Hydrate (With Style) 💧**

- Grab a glass of water or your favorite (non-caffeinated) drink. Add some slices of lemon or mint. Get fancy!
- Hydration helps clear the brain fog. Plus, you'll feel like royalty drinking it. 👑

### **5. Set a Quick Goal ⏳**

- Before diving back in, jot down **one thing** you want to accomplish in the next hour.
- Keeping it small and manageable will make you feel in control instead of overwhelmed.

### **6. Tune Into Some Energizing Music 🎶**

- Put on your favorite upbeat song. Just a couple of minutes can change your vibe completely.
- Dancing like no one’s watching is highly encouraged. Your coworkers might side-eye you, but trust me, it’ll be worth it!

### Getting most out of your day doesn’t always mean pushing through the slogs. Sometimes, you just need to hit that “reset” button. Give yourself permission to take that break guilt-free!

Help!","ISO of a cat-friendly rental or space — my cat is over 18 years old. I am staying at a shelter, and sadly she can’t come with me. I am seeking housing, asap, to be reunited with her. I am a non-smoker, and do not drink or use any type of substances (except coffee ☕️ — big coffee fan). I keep freaking out, thinking my cat is going to pass away soon (especially due to me being gone/away). She is staying somewhere where I also sadly found out(after finally visiting her after 2+ long weeks) she is being neglected. The only time she poops out of her litter box is when it is filled to the brim —- well, when I arrived , there was old poop multiple places , and flies galore. I knew she had been neglected, because this poop was where the human supposedly supposed to be watching her would have showered ! There were flies all over it — and it was old poop.  She looked distraught and weak too. 

I am severely scared I am going to lose my cat, and it’s 100% avoidable , and I don’t know what to do. The shelter I am at is chaotic, and since I arrived I’ve been trying to work with my case manager (the first one quit or so the week I arrived ??), and there has not been any help in regards to my cat and me reuniting. I made this Reddit tonight to reach out to the community and do my best to find someone that can read my words and maybe have some ideas or suggestions—— and maybe even feels bad enough that they can let me live with them for 30 days (I can pay !), so I can have my cat with me . I am truly desperate - I don’t want to lose my cat because of neglect — by the hands of someone who I trusted, who I clearly can’t - and now (still) must rely on. It’s all heartbreaking, and my cat doesn’t deserve any of it. She’s a lovely being, and I truly care about her. I’ve had her since I was 14. She’s my true family.

1o0zfzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthday/comments/1o0zfzx/ive_tried_every_way_to_make_my_kids_birthday/,I’ve tried every way to make my kid’s birthday invitation — here’s what I learned,"My daughter’s birthday was approaching, and I went down a rabbit hole trying to create a nice invitation. I thought it’d be simple — you pick a cute picture, add some text, done. Nope. Turns out there are way too many ways to do it, and I somehow tried all of them.

First, I opened Photoshop, because that’s what I used back in college for random design stuff. It’s still powerful, but man… It’s *not* made for tired parents who just want something cute and fast. I spent an hour adjusting fonts and snowflakes, and the result still looked like a PowerPoint slide. Unless you already know what you’re doing, Photoshop is overkill for a kid’s party invite.

Then I discovered Canva, and it was like a breath of fresh air. It’s drag-and-drop, it has ready-made kids’ templates, and you can finish the whole thing while your coffee’s still warm. I ended up using it for one of the parties — I think the theme was “Rainbow Safari” or something equally chaotic — and it turned out pretty good. The only catch is that once you’ve seen a few of their templates, they start to all look kind of the same.

I also gave Evite a shot because it handles RSVPs automatically. Functionally, it works — people can just click “yes” or “no,” which saves a lot of group-chat confusion — but the designs feel a little outdated. Like, early-Facebook-event vibes. Still, if you care more about getting quick responses than looking Pinterest-perfect, it does the job.

Paperless Post is a fancier version of Evite. The designs are beautiful, very polished, but most of the nice ones cost a few coins (their in-app currency). It’s good if you want something that feels “premium” — I used it for one year when we did a small tea party, and it looked like something from a lifestyle magazine. Just expect to spend a few bucks.

And then, there’s Etsy. I was skeptical at first, but honestly? It’s probably the easiest option if you don’t want to design anything yourself. You just search “kids birthday invitation,” buy a template that fits your theme, and the seller often customizes it for you. I once paid $6 for a unicorn one, sent them my kid’s name and date, and got the file back in a few hours. Zero effort, and it looked amazing.

If I had to sum it up: Photoshop is for designers, Canva is for normal humans, Evite is for organizers, Paperless Post is for aesthetes, and Etsy is for people who just want it done and over with. 🎂

Anyway, that’s been my experience after trying pretty much everything. What about you all — do you have a go-to way of making birthday invites that actually feels worth the time?",1,1759892805.0,birthday,3,1.0,False

I hope they don't feel this is me rubbing it in their face. This is more to give them hope. 

At long last, I have some good news to share. 

Life is finally getting back on to a more even kilter. I am still learning and transitioning but I'm on the up at last 

2 years and 11 days after her first stroke, Mum has officially been cleared to use her electric wheelchair outside and she's getting better at using it every time. 

The first time we took her out it was me and her respite carer. It was terrifying because we had to cross roads but I was able to rember the feelings when she started using the wheelchair and was able to rember that she will get better at using it (and she did!). 

We've started going out for coffees and seeing more friends. 

At last I feel I can go wedding dress shopping with her so perhaps in the near future I'll actually have a wedding planned! 

My fiancé and I have been on a much needed holiday. We are still living at our respective parents but that's due to other circumstances (our house flooded but we will be able to return soon and I finally feel safe enough and able to). 

To add to that, My fiance's flat has finally sold and we are fixing up my house to sell and move closer. It's an amazing feeling. 

I was given a short trauma course as an interim to the main therapy and it opened my eyes. I was diagnosed with PTSD (questionably C-PTSD) and finally understood it more. 

I've waited so. Damn. Long. For some of this and I haven't always felt joyous over all of it. Sometimes I'm still angry. Sometimes I still cry. In some moments it still feels too much but I've learnt what rescourses I need, where they are and I use them. I've learnt to name what I am feeling and that helps others to understand without me explaining. 

It has been hell. Life will forever be different, but for the first time ever I feel I actually am able to move on from the trauma. I said it my last post I wouldn't be able to do that, but I was wrong. It will always shape me, but I feel it doesn't define me so much now, or at least it doesn't need to. This is a place I never thought I could be. 

I therefore want to thank those of you here who've followed my journey. I don't know if/when I'll update again but I do still read your stories and think of you all. X x x ",10,1759892788.0,stroke,0,1.0,False

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time, I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face who looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.

Blue collar upbringing blue collar culture etc

I’ve got the expected general disdain for the upper class and it’s only somewhat rooted in envy.

I’m not that impressed by their high art, or fashion, or nice houses in bland suburban neighborhoods.

I don’t strive towards driving an expensive car to a rich person nightclub i sincerely prefer drinking with and dating and socializing with other working class people.

However, there’s something about grocery shopping that instills a pathetic desire to brush up against my betters.

I’ve literally smoked crack with homeless people and didn’t feel any sense of superiority, but seeing fat loud families at Walmart makes me go ew.

I’m talking health food stores. Harmons. Trader Joe’s is actually pretty affordable but it still counts as bougie. The local hipster butcher in the gentrified part of town. Locally sourced coffee.

Shopping like a yuppie a such a pleasant experience. These stores don’t have fluorescent lights it’s all warm and yellow. There’s chalkboards with art in the produce section. Pumpkins and shit autumnal vibes.

The cereal aisle doesn’t have captain crunch of frosted flakes. They decided they’re too elegant to stock cereal marketed by cartoon characters and they’re right. So I’ll pay twice as much for half as  much for the Reese’s Puffs equivalent that’s made with whole grains.

And these stores are full of beautiful fit people buying tofu and artisan hot sauce.

Even the cashiers are weirdly non working class

Trader Joe’s doesn’t hire disabled vets or ex cons. It’s smiling dudes that are in between peace corp assignments or hot 22 year old college girls with delicate line work bird tattoos.

I hate the upper middle class 80% of the time but I love cosplaying as them and chipping off a fat chunk of pay check to eat well and buy good whole foods and kambucha ",16,1759892740.0,redscarepod,10,0.86,False

Jason breathed quietly as he slept in the dark of his cabin, the stars moved silently across the window, a small red light blinking on his desk terminal as it too lay dormant, and nothing but the low hum of the ship’s ventilation system and the slight buzz of the gravity coils beneath the floor quietly working to simulate earth’s standard gravity. These noises caused Jason no trouble, if working as intended, they emitted a hardly audible sound. Plus, as a career captain, he had long ago become used to the various noises his ship emitted throughout the day. Of course, as is usual, he had also trained himself to rise from specific sounds as well, such as...



*ERRRN! ERRRN ERRRN!*



... the sound of an incoming communication. Jason’s eyes opened by instinct and he slowly rose from his bed. He looked towards his desk, where a standard intercom was positioned by his terminal, both integrated to his desk for efficiency. As its alarm sounded, a red light blinked in rhythm with it, doing its job at pulling his attention towards it. He stood from the edge of his bed and walked over to the desk, banging his foot on its edge and yelping in pain. He took this as a nudge to actually turn on a light or two. He felt around the edge of his desk for a moment until he found the switch to the desk lamp, which was *not* integrated into the desk, for inefficiency. The yellowish light of the bulb illuminated the desk well, and the rest of the room sufficiently enough. Jason sat at his desk, the simply padded chair gave a pathetic *pof* and squeak as he rested his weight on it, and he leaned his arm on the off-white plastic top of the desk. Blinking his eyes as they adjusted to the light, he reached over to the still buzzing intercom, flipping the orange-red paddle switch to *speak*, the alarm stopped and its blinking red light turned to solid green. Jason leaned forward over and finally answered the call.

	

“Talk to me” he groaned, his voice still rough from sleep.

	

“This is Rodgers, captain. Did you get a good sleep?”



“Eh, the few hours I did get were fine, I assume we’ve got some info?”



“We did indeed Sir, the monitoring post has confirmed previously unrecorded interstellar messaging coming from Barnard's star, specifically Barnard e on the outskirts of the system.”



“I see, do they have the data available for transfer?”



“Yes, Sir. Where would you like me to send it?”



“Send it up to me here, terminal 27A. Have the helm set a course for Barnard e, I’ll take a look at the data before I leave and meet you on the bridge.”



“Yes, Sir. Rodgers out.” The intercom let out a small beep and then silence, and Jason leaned back into the chair, turning it slightly to face his terminal. He leaned forward again, reaching around the side of the block that was the monitor, his fingers found another paddle switch, this one attached to the terminal system within the desk, and switched it to *ON*. the clicks and beeps of the terminal booting up filled the room, and the curved glass screen of the monitor blipped to life as bright green lines and characters flashed across the screen before revealing a stylized logo of the manufacturer; “*PLEIADES”.* The logo scrolled up out of the screen, making way for the default home screen. A series of green bordered boxes against a stark black background sat idle, save for one flashing that read “DATA TRANSFER”. Jason moved his to the keyboard, and moved selection down to the flashing option, and pressed enter. The screen flashed green and changed to a simple list of data values, the star observed, the planet, and the anomalous readings. Jason sipped from a mug that he had left on the desk the day previous, only for his tongue to taste cold day-old coffee. His face scrunched back in disgust, and he placed the mug back down and pushed it away. Putting his attention back towards the readings on screen. As Rodgers had described, there was a series of targeted subspace frequencies emitting from Barnard e over the past week that had not been observed before, and they were all targeted towards one place; Mokarda. Jason put his head down, sighed, and stood up and began to put on his uniform to head to the bridge. This data was just one more piece of a growing pile of evidence all pointing to one thing; the Mokarans were continuing to encroach on Earth’s interstellar space.



Jason walked briskly through the narrow halls of his ship, his black boots thudding against the metal floors as he passed. As he walked he noted several other crewmen going about their duties, entering doors into offices or workrooms, engineers repairing wiring or referencing terminals, and officers making sure inventory was up to date. Every single one stopped and stood as he passed, a curt “Captain” ushering from their mouths before returning to their duties. He soon found himself before a lift, waiting for the doors to slide open. No sooner did he press the button did the doors open, as if they too were responding to his rank. Within the lift was the ship’s Encryption Officer, the blue and red oval patch contrasting starkly against his olive-green jumpsuit, and the bulge of the data diskette tucked and wired into his shoulder pocket. The officer looked up, stood straight and let out a “Captain” as Jason entered. 



“At ease, Nguyen. I’m just on the way to the bridge. Fancy joining me?” Jason asked. EO Ahn Nguyen was an older man, the sides of his hair had turned grey, framing his own military experience well. Slightly shorter than Jason, he carried himself upright and confident, serving as the ECS Caddo’s Encryption officer for nine years, and never once offering any issues. 



“Delighted, Sir. I was just heading there myself. I heard we’re heading to the Barnard system?” Nguyen asked, as he pressed the corresponding button on the lift’s button-pad, ushering the doors closed and the lift to begin in ascent. Jason always found his ability to find and retain information bewildering, even for an EO.



“One step ahead as always, Nguyen. You heard right, the Monitoring post at Alpha Centauri confirmed subspace transmissions towards Mokarda less than an hour ago.” Nguyen shook his head and sighed.



“That all but proves it then, another Mokaran communication array, and this time right in our backyard.”



“More like our back porch. But I get your meaning.” The two waited in silence for a moment as the short trip up to the bridge continued, until Jason pressed the *HOLD* button, stopping the lift as the button illuminated.



“Sir...?” Nguyen questioned, looking towards his captain.



“Ahn, we’ve been through this song and dance with the Mokarans for years at this point. They place a listening post, or a communications array, or a “science outpost” that’s clearly not a science outpost, and all this within our own space. So tell me, what happens next?.” Nguyen stood and thought for a moment, considering the best answer.



“Well, Sir. I would say what’s going to happen is we deliver our confirmation of this array to the top brass back on earth, they keep it quiet for a few months until inevitably a trucker on an interstellar shipping lane gets blasted with garbled mokaran messaging as it passes by the array. He’ll report it to his boss, who will report it to him, somebody’s going to blab about it on the ComNet, and soon everybody is going to be talking about the secret spy base or weapons depot that keeps being built closer and closer to earth every few months.” Jason nodded in agreement.



“And then, the military command makes a formal statement about what was actually found, questions are asked, nothing gets answered, not from us or the civvies, and we go about our days with that little extra bit of anxiety in the back of our heads. Rinse and repeat and you have the last five years”. The two of them nodded in agreement and looked to the stark walls of the lift, as if it too would  respond in agreement.



“So, Captain, what is your expert opinion on this ever-so evident cycle?” Jason swallowed hard, and tried to play it off, unsuccessfully.



“My opinion, Ahn, is that something big is coming, something nobody wants to discuss. And there are people back on earth that know something. They know something they don’t want anyone else to know about, so they send us out, collecting our little data sets and reporting back with a “Yes Sir, right away Sir” and getting back out there, while they’re keeping us in the dark.”



“A terrifying proposition, Sir. but an astute one”. Jason pressed the stop button again, it’s light going dark and the lift resuming it’s now lengthened trip upwards.



“Let’s get this Mission done.” Declared Jason “and then we see if we can get some real work done.” With that, the doors of the lift slid open, revealing the entry hall of the bridge. The two stepped forth and entered the bridge, opening its heaving sliding door with the press of a button. Within the bridge the atmosphere changed, rather than quiet humming and daily work, the nerve center of the ship moved at a brisk pace. Officers were speaking into their headpieces, monitoring scrolling datasets on curved screens embedded into the walls. Others were walking between stations, collecting diskettes for compiling. And the two helmsmen sat in their identical enclosed seats on opposite sides of the bridge, eyes forward towards the main viewspace, each one situated surrounded by several screens relaying trajectory, FTL engine status,and stellar movement calculations. According to their screens, their relatively short journey towards Barnard’s star was nearly complete. Jason moved between the two helmsmen, all officers on the bridge acknowledging his presence as before, but not taking their eyes off their tasks, as is protocol during FTL transit. Jason took his place at the captain’s chair, and  Ahn ducked into the door to the left leading to the main encryptor room. Jason sat in his chair, a small screen embedded into his right armrest, and a series of small control buttons below it. Checking the ship’s status on his end, all seemed in order.



“Status.” he asked, a simple command, but effective. The right-hand helmsman, lieutenant Barlow, answered.



“We’re approaching the outskirts of Barnard’s star as directed, Captain. FTL dropout in one minute, twenty-seven seconds.” 



“How close will we be coming in to Barnard e?”



“We’ll be approaching the planet’s orbit at approximately 100, 263 Miles, captain. We’ll be entering high orbit upon FTL dropout.”



“Understood, all hands, prepare for dropout.” Jason spoke into the intercom, informing the rest of the crew their condition. He looked to the zooming stars in front of him as they came closer and closer to their destination. An event he had experienced many times before, but this time, with trepidation. After his conversation with Ahn, he couldn’t help but feel as if they all were on the precipice, hurtling towards something which carries unforeseen consequences. Regardless of this feeling, the time had come, and they approached barnard e.



“FTL dropout in 3... 2... and 1” the left helmsmen announced, the ship shuddered slightly and a low *thud* echoed throughout the ship as the FTL engine disengaged. 



“FTL dropout confirmed, status nominal, we are planet side.” Jason looked out from the viewspace, a small red dwarf star shone in the distance, basking the bridge in a dim red light. Before them, closer still, Barnard e sat, suspended by a red starbeam in the inky black. A small, barren, brown rocky planet cast a crescent shape against the field of stars. This system was devoid of any natural life, and in a somber sort of way, that made it peaceful. But all peace must come to an end, and Captain Jason Shiroma would be the one to end it.

A bit about me:
Early 30s, work remotely, love Southern California, good conversations, and a peaceful but inspiring environment.

Budget: ideally $2,500–$3,000/month for a 1BR (a little flexible).
Priorities: friendly culture, safety, walkability, beach access, and a welcoming vibe.

Currently considering: Laguna Beach, Oceanside, Carlsbad, or Pacific Beach - but open to other ideas if there's somewhere I'm not thinking of! 
(I realize that I can hop in a car and go all over SD / OC / LA for all sorts of activities - but I'm very interested in a walkable neighborhood where I can take walks daily & run some errands throughout the day on foot) 

Questions:

- Which areas do you think would be the best fit for someone in their early 30s who wants a balance of a peaceful environment to live in and also a nice social life?
- Do you have a walkable neighborhood you love - with good options for groceries, coffee, happy hour, etc in the neighborhood? 
- Any specific neighborhoods to focus on -or avoid?
- Anywhere you love to live with a strong sense of community that is easy to meet people in? 

For context: I’m a Christian, gay but don't resonate with a lot of mainstream gay culture, and pretty independently-minded politically. 
I get along with all kinds of people but have found LA’s crime, extreme political culture, and anti-faith attitudes a bit exhausting lately. Looking for somewhere that feels kind, open-minded, and genuinely connected.🙂

Someone who can laugh at dumb memes, but also get lost in talks about dreams, grief, childhood, love, or whatever storm is passing through.
Someone who isn’t afraid to say, “I’m not okay, can we just exist together today?”

I don’t need perfect. I need present. I need depth.
If you’re a little cracked but still showing up, empathetic but strong, funny but carrying quiet storms you get it.

I’d love to share study sessions lo-fi beats in the background, two screens glowing in different corners of the world. Not mandatory, not the main thing. But it’d be a cool bonus.

Imagine:
Midnight hustle.
Chai or coffee in hand.
A mix of dumb memes and deep truths on breaks.
Encouragement when motivation dips.

Some are life-changing, others are… life-adjacent. They hover in that strange space between “actually brilliant” and “what on earth am I supposed to do with this information?”

I call these the **uselessly useful tips**.

For example:

* *“If you ever find yourself in quicksand, lie back and float.”* (How many quicksand incidents do you think I encounter in my daily routine? Exactly zero. Still, nice to know.)
* *“Butter the toast to the edges, or the devil will find a way in.”* (Technically about good hospitality. Spiritually, about warding off evil carbs.)
* *“Never trust a man with two first names.”* (Harsh on John Pauls everywhere, but not entirely wrong.)

These little rules lodge themselves in the brain, ready to pounce in highly unlikely scenarios. I’ve never been stuck in quicksand, but if I were, I’d be smug about how prepared I am.

And then there are the tips that sound useless but end up working:

* *“Drink water before your coffee, and you won’t feel like a shrivelled raisin all day.”*
* *“If you can’t fix it with duct tape, you’re not using enough duct tape.”*
* *“Always keep a loaf of bread in the freezer.”* (This one actually changed my life.)

So now I’m curious:  
👉 **What’s the most useful, useless tip you’ve ever heard?**

Drop it in the comments. Bonus points if it’s the kind of thing your nan swore by, or something so oddly specific it’s basically useless to 99.9% of the population.

1o0zbrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1o0zbrp/drink_water_reminder_actually_improved_my_study/,Drink water reminder actually improved my study focus weird connection,"This might sound random but getting hydration reminders has legit improved my study sessions.

I kept having these awful afternoon crashes where I'd read the same paragraph 5 times and retain nothing. Thought it was just normal study fatigue or too much caffeine.

Started tracking my water intake (using WaterMinder, nothing fancy) and realized I was drinking maybe one glass of water during entire 8-hour library sessions. Just coffee and energy drinks lol.

Set up reminders every 90 minutes. Gentle buzz on my watch so I don't disturb others. Just enough to make me take a sip and maybe stretch for 30 seconds.

**What changed:** Way less brain fog in the afternoon Can actually focus for 2+ hour blocks consistently Sleep better (less caffeine needed) Fewer headaches during finals week

The micro-breaks for hydration actually help reset my focus too. Like a built-in pomodoro reminder that doesn't feel forced.

Anyone else notice study performance improves with basic self-care stuff? I was so focused on study techniques and completely ignoring the fact that my brain needs water to function 🤦‍♀️

A bit about me:
Early 30s, work remotely, love Southern California, good conversations, and a peaceful but inspiring environment.

Budget: ideally $2,500–$3,000/month for a 1BR (a little flexible).
Priorities: friendly culture, safety, walkability, beach access, and a welcoming vibe.

Currently considering: Laguna Beach, Oceanside, Carlsbad, or Pacific Beach - but open to other ideas if there's somewhere I'm not thinking of! 
(I realize that I can hop in a car and go all over SD / OC / LA for all sorts of activities - but I'm very interested in a walkable neighborhood where I can take walks daily & run some errands throughout the day on foot) 

Questions:

- Which areas do you think would be the best fit for someone in their early 30s who wants a balance of a peaceful environment to live in and also a nice social life?
- Do you have a walkable neighborhood you love - with good options for groceries, coffee, happy hour, etc in the neighborhood? 
- Any specific neighborhoods to focus on -or avoid?
- Anywhere you love to live with a strong sense of community that is easy to meet people in? 

For context: I’m a Christian, gay but don't resonate with a lot of mainstream gay culture, and pretty independently-minded politically. 
I get along with all kinds of people but have found LA’s crime, extreme political culture, and anti-faith attitudes a bit exhausting lately. Looking for somewhere that feels kind, open-minded, and genuinely connected.🙂

It actually caught me off guard for a second because it sounded so natural and local. But when I got to the window, the person serving me was Indian, which made me wonder if the greeting was pre-recorded or if someone else takes the orders  before it’s handed off to whoever’s working the window.

Later that day my wife grabbed Tim’s from another location across town and said the exact same thing happened to her same kind of “Canadian” voice, then a different person at the window.

So now I’m just curious… has anyone else noticed this? Are they using some kind of automated system for drive-thru greetings now?

1o0z90i,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1o0z90i/im_in_the_middle_of_doing_a_gluten_challenge/,I’m  in the middle of doing a gluten challenge,"I can’t believe how painful this is. That’s really it. I can believe it cus I lived with this pain daily for over two years now - my main symptom is excruciating like want to vomit and feel faint level pain in my bladder and urethra, like razor blades when peeing but 24/7. I am 30F

I foolishly cut gluten when trying to investigate this strange uti pain and/or recurrent uti actual infections for so long.. and voila! It all magically disappeared when I figured out it was gluten. 1.5 years of DAILY pain feeling like an umbrella was being shoved up my urethra everyday GONE after not eating gluten with days and lasting months?! Amazing.

I also struggled with constipation like going once every two weeks most of my life horribly…. Magically was going everyday within one week GF. I also looked so bloated people thought I was pregnant a lot…. Suddenly gone GF. My GERD got better too. My skin seemed clearer. Those things were all smaller to me in comparison to the UTI pain but were huge jarring “oh maybe this was the issue for who knows how long” moment for me. 

But then I couldn’t get tested since I didn’t know I needed to per my Dr and my own lack of knowledge (regret) but I found a great GI Dr who confirmed I have the gene for celiac and said I need to eat gluten again for 8 weeks and do bloodwork and biopsy. Either way I’m going back to GF.

So few weeks ago, I began eating normally.. the first day or so felt great. Totally gaslit myself - maybe it was in my  head, how could I have been right? I’m not a dr. I’ve seen about thirty drs and no one suggested gluten being the issue, I’m obviously just crazy and it’s in my head. Right?

Then days in, it all came crashing back. All back to the crying helplessly on the floor in that same level of pain, burning urethra, sore bladder, body pain, now nerve pain???? I escaped after 1.5 years in my urethra. Total inflammation like the devil himself is holding a lighter to it. Then it eases for a few hours. Until the next day when I eat more gluten to fulfill the 8 weeks.. then it comes roaring back for several hours straight. Every day.

This is just a rant, I have no one in my life who understands. 

And the worst part is, when I did go gluten free for the 3 months I had no more urinary or bladder pain at all (minus gluten free bread caused it once??? Testing for yeast allergy now.) BUT I was near fainting, developed POTS 3 weeks into it(I know probably not related), was scared I was dying cus I kept getting faint and anemic but was not prior to quitting gluten so odd, my urine and bloodwork looked like starvation? I was scared I wasn’t getting enough carbs, yet I had potatoes everyday, gf pasta, gf bakery items, gf everything that had carbs still, like I ate Scharr at every meal, so much rice etc. No idea why my body reacted that way. But I always felt hungry no matter how much gluten free everything I was eating, for months. I basically binge ate non GF carbs so I don’t get it. I ate a ton of protein, and a buttload of fruits and vegetables daily. It all went away when I began the gluten challenge again within a day or two though and I finally didn’t feel like I was dying anymore. Why?!?! How?? 

I’m sorry as I know this is probably an annoying post. I’m 110% ranting cus I need to get this out once. I’m eating all my favorite foods cus I know even if celiac is negative I really can’t handle the pain and inflammation gluten is causing - which all began during intense trauma and worsened after a sudden loss and grief..I just want to feel safe in my body and eat and feel full and enjoy food. I know it’ll take time. I know everyone here has suffered and I’m not unique. I’m just so confused

The 1 thing I’ll never get is basically.. I was traumatized so badly from something shocking that happened in my personal life that I can’t eat croissants ever again?? In short that’s what happened (sorry sounds weird explaining vaguely) when it all began. And then - the person closest to me, my soulmate, I miss him every second, died unexpectedly and I can’t even eat croissants without getting a rash, UTI, and ulcers ????? With it all ramping up? 

The list of things I’ve done for 2 YEARS before figuring out gluten is honestly nuts from thousands on internal physical therapy, treating pudental nerve, 4 months straight of antibiotics,  my bf taking antibiotics also in case, ph balanced everything, probiotics, no sex (and including the last months of my bfs life - cus no one knew to test me for gluten or suggested eliminating), changing my iud not once but twice - double ouch, going on the pill, going off the pill, using estrogen cream, testing for every std on the planet and probably ones off of it if that was possible, traveled to the city and being treated by every floor of specialists at NYU repeatedly, doing the interstitial cystitis diet, cranberry pills powder and herbs, paying out of pocket monthly for a chronic uti specialist, quit coffee which I miss everyday.. Now in medical debt and broke before that tbh idk why I did half of these things but desperation. And I had to go into therapy when the pain level made me have unsafe thoughts, and and a ton more random remedies I was told to do I can’t even think of.
Finally now a neurologist was also shocked no one did auto immune tests and ordered a ton, pending aside from the celiac testing in the near future with GI dr.

Thank you for anyone who read this and I’m sorry cus I know I’m complaining when I should be grateful that I know a cure for a bulk of my physical pain, I know a lot of people have it worse, and I really am grateful to know it’s the issue but just hate that I’m doing this all over again until December. I’m going to plan to actually talk to a nutritionist if I can with insurance to get help when I go gf again to prevent issues I hope

If anyone has any tips, advice, or ways to better manage this it will be so appreciated so so much. <3 to everyone who is here.",4,1759892226.0,glutenfree,2,1.0,False
1o0z8ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o0z8ud/i_let_my_exgirlfriend_with_cancer_move_in_when/,"I let my ex-girlfriend with cancer move in when she had no where else to go, she tried to get with someone I use to call my best friend.  AITAH?","So about 5 months ago my(32M) ex-girlfriend Marie(33M) called me randomly from a local mental health facility, she and her mom had gotten into yet another fight, this one ending in Marie throwing her moms laptop through a window, and the next day Marie arriving in cuffs at a mental health facility. Her mom had filed an injunction so Marie could not return to the house. She had no where to go and no money and no job and breast cancer.

We had dated a couple years ago for a few months. Things were mostly good but towards the end i felt mostly used, like I only existed when she needed something, but she would never exist when i did. I voiced that to her but nothing changed, I broke up with her reluctantly, I really loved her. she asked if we could get back together a month later, we got into a fight and immediately broke up again the day after. I stayed hung up on her for a while. Probably until now. But we remained on good terms. Friends even. I asked for space to get over her I never really got. It just became normal. 

The fast forward to May of this year and I get the call. I accept no questions asked. I did my best to clean the house while she stayed out her week in the facility. I threw away a ton of stuff to make room for hers. I bought a cot to sleep on and gave her my bed and made room in the drawers/closet for her clothes. 

The cot doesn’t last long. She insists that I share the bed, but we make an agreement to not take anything further romantically since she isn’t in a good place for that. Which I agree to, I’m only trying to be supportive in her time of need. 

Things go on, we have some tussles I’d like to attribute to the growing pains of suddenly bunking with someone you used to date. Mostly money related or time related. Small potatoes now though. 

Things go well mostly, the plan initially is to get her back on  her feet. Meanwhile I’m working full time and supporting both of us. 
We do a full deep clean of the house top to bottom over the course of about a month which goes mostly okay. And by we I mean I cleaned and rearranged 80 percent of the house and she helped. Most namely the bedroom and the kitchen. Which would be fine but if you ask her she cleaned all of the house with no help. Which I don’t know where she can justify saying that but I digress. 

About a week into it, I’m coming home from work and gargling mouth wash. She starts getting upset and emotional that I’m washing away traces of another woman.  I’m puzzled because of the agreement but whatever. I wasn’t. About a month or so in we’re getting close again and comfortable. I don’t once push pressure or expect anything, but soon enough she’s making comments hinting about being my girlfriend. soon after that she’s the one to literally ask if we could have sex. I am but a man, duh. So whatever great yeah I mean I’m mostly happy, I still love her a lot. I’m going with the flow. Meanwhile I’m doing a lot for her. More than we agreed on over the initial phone call but whatever. Im taking off work to take her to all her doctors appointments, I’m doing grocery and store runs, making her 2 lattes a day to keep from spending so much on her Starbucks, meal prepping each week to save money on eating out. Making trip after trip to bring things from her mom’s house since she can’t. Giving her free access to my weed, cleaning her cats litter box and her trash. I’m paying for everything, and it’s more than i thought. I was thinking double what it takes to sustain myself initially but it easily became triple if not 4 times at some points, she always has to have the expensive stuff, the extra add ons, the large up charge so on. Meanwhile she stays at home all day every day only working on her art or crocheting and watching tv. I try to reason with her that it isn’t sustainable on my income to spend like that. Nothing changes. I try to voice that I’m getting burnt out working full time, cleaning constantly, and getting no help with the house work. I know she has cancer and am very empathetic to it, but she’s not terminal or bed ridden, just lazy. Mostly weaponized incompetence. Nothing changes. This leads to frustrations. Some resentment. Whatever.

A couple months in and we’re going to a doctors appointment, running late, her fault again. We arrive right on time but realize we’re not in the right building, twice. At this point im rushing and power-walking and she’s taking her time and getting frustrated that im rushing her. Like girl im trying to get you to your appointment for your cancer and I can’t afford to take off work to reschedule. Whatever I try and slow down. After the appointment she starts going off on how embarrassing it is that I was walking so far ahead of her while she was struggling to keep up. I feel bad and try justify that it was for her best interests and apologize but nothing works it turns into a fight. She keeps berating me about how I lack “emotional intelligence” and says she can never be in a relationship with someone like me. That we need to give eachother as much space as possible. I still think it’s unreasonable, I was always the one to apologize and make up no matter who I thought was in the wrong. But this time I couldn’t. I was doing everything I could and nothing was ever good enough, she had criticisms about everything I did, even the favors for her. Nothing was ever clean enough or the perfect Goldilocks level for her. We had fights but I thought this was such an overreaction. I waited for an apology that never came. They never did. 

I let things blow over, figured we could work it out. A couple months goes by, nothing really changes I’m still paying for basically everything. Doing everything for her, going broke and burning myself out in the process. 
But we hadn’t fought in a while. During this period she gets back into her night owl routine, staying up all night with lights on and her music playing. She could ask me not to come to bed too early sometimes because she’s was “just getting on a roll”(talking 2,3am, I wake up at 7/8 for work.)

I try talking to her about how it’s making it difficult for me to get enough sleep, I started averaging less than 4, she says it’s messed up for me to expect her to revolve around my (regular) sleep schedule, I see if she can do that stuff in another room but little changes. I learn to sleep through the lights/tv/music/ typing. 

During this time she began teasing me about my old best friend DJ, someone that stopped talking to me out of the blue one day, and someone she used to be into but he never had feelings back. So it’s a sore topic for several reasons. Early on I ask her to try and not mention him. I set a boundary. One she repeatedly broke. These started out as what I thought were jokes. I would do something for her and she would say “do you think DJ would do that for me?” These got progressively worse and more frequent. Finally I asked if she was talking/into DJ again. She says “yeah, sorry” and this point I’m so like flabbergasted, like seriously? then i get pissed, I tell her things like to go ask DJ to take her to doctors appointments and go broke supporting her. I tell her I don’t want to make her coffees anymore, that I don’t want to give her my green for free anymore.  That this is fucked for so many reasons. She asks what the big deal is and says it’s fucked up that I’m “retaliating by taking resources away”

She’s completely dismissing anything im upset about. She’s shows no remorse whatsoever. This only gets me more aggravated. She knows I won’t kick her out. She said if the roles were reversed she would be supportive. We get heated. At one point she says “I think you’re an abuser you just haven’t done it yet” She expects nothing to change as if she gets to break my heart and continue gettin a free ride on my dime.  When I’m breaking down and at my lowest she pulls out her phone and starts recording me.

After about a day of being pissed i try to calm down. I try to be “supportive” and am just done fighting, im mostly sad at this point. We have a good day. We watch a movie she had been wanting to see. We go to bed early bc she has a doctors appointment the next moment. 

Literally from the moment i awake she’s already in a foul mood. Saying she couldn’t sleep because the cats and I kept farting and giving her “really clingy energy” yesterday I don’t react. She asks if I can get McDonald’s. Whatever. She doesn’t eat the McDonald’s. The day goes by normal. I keep the “clingy” comment in mind and avoid her as much as I can but we share a room. At one point in the day she makes a comment clearly referring to DJ. This upsets me, I don’t react. Later I (nicely)ask her to take her trash out since it comes in the morning (and I’m tired of doing her chores)

She gives me the snottiest “yeah” she could muster. I ask what’s up with the aggression. She says “you’ve been up my ass all day”

At this point I’d been avoiding a fight all day. Like I already feel like I was being generous in not kicking her out and still buying her food and giving her green. Id been trying to be cool the last 2 days but she clearly wanted to fight. I took the bait, I went off. I told her repeated mentioning of DJ after I asked her to stop and emotionally blackmailing me into continuing support for her was abusive.

This triggers her. Biggest fight yet. She’s so offended that I would call her abusive. That she comes from an abusive mother and abusive exes. I let us cool off and apologize, she shrugs it off and brings the fight back later. Still pissed. I tell her I’m not trying to fight and wasn’t trying to fight earlier. She accuses me of starting then fight earlier when I was reacting to her. The fight goes in circles and climaxes with her screaming at the top of her lungs to “STOP” repeatedly when I’m trying to hold her accountable for picking a fight all day. 

The next day she’s still acting like it’s my fault, saying how fucked up I am for putting her In this position. She keeps saying I need to be accountable for my actions and I am. I was pissed about the DJ thing but nothing unreasonable given the circumstances. I get upset and passive aggressive when it feels like out whatevership is once sided. We get in another fight which ends in her yelling “STOP ABUSING ME STOP ABUSING ME” to which I take out my phone and start recording. That night I come home to web printout of an article about how “Abusers provoke and record” i point out that’s what she did to me first, and the one I recorded was a fight she provoked.

We go silent for a day. Then as I’m going to bed the next night around 3 am she starts the conversation about how i need to be accountable for my actions. I’m so tired of everything at this point. I tell her I’d rather go to bed but she insists we have this conversation. It gets heated when she decides to get her phone and record. I do the same. As soon as record pressed she was acting goofy and silly, we actually end up having a super productive conversation about our grievances for about 30 minutes when we disagree on something and it devolves into her shouting and ramping up. At multiple times in the video I try and disengage and go to bed or tell her I’m not going to have the conversation if she’s going to yell. She continues to ramp up. Insisting I was provoking this reaction out of her on purpose. I was not. I remained calm because I didn’t want to fight, I wanted to sleep, it was 4 am, I also didn’t want to make a fool out of myself on camera. It escalated into her saying very nasty hurtful comments, name calling. Swinging the bathroom door at me violently, not letting me use the bathroom in private, swiping at my phone, claiming to be trying to “record my pee” she’s getting so crazy and sadistic and this point. I turn off the lights and try and go to bed and she gets in my face (still on video but now in the dark) and just will not stop for minutes laying into me about how all my passive aggressiveness has gotten her to her breaking point. It boils down to her ramping up to unreasonable levels. I tell her to never come crawling back to me again when she completely loses it and melts down telling me to stop gaslighting her, she screaming at this point, slapping at me while I’m still recording her. I’m cornered in bathroom at this point, i just run for the exit. I go to the living room but can’t sleep the rest of the night. I keep thinking she’s gonna sneak up on me in the dark or something. 

After that she’s says she can’t believe me, that I’m so manipulative and fucked for making her act like that. Wtf I tell her to watch the video as I have, she says all she sees is a girl fighting for her life against a manipulator. 

She started posting to Facebook about how she’s in “an abusive situation, about how an ex took her in and even though she set boundaries clearly there’s been expectations of her”

I told her to quit cherry picking facts and using half truths and tell the whole story if she’s going to go on socials with all that bullshit. 

So that was a few weeks ago. She’s still here, trying to figure out game plan to get her the fuck out of my house because she’s made it a living hell but I still couldn’t live with myself if i put her on the street with no where to go. She still treats me like I’m in the wrong here. Like I put her in this situation, like I’m an abuser. Part of me believes it but I’ve only ever did things that benefitted her. I’d get frustrated when she would be demanding or entitled but given the circumstances it was reasonable. Nothing i did was ever anywhere close to the level she’s brought it too. 

There’s been a lot more I’ve left out to keep it “short” but please someone tell me I’m not crazy

We’ve been friends for 2 years now, and I just feel like the transactional (?) part of our friendship is not balanced. Whenever we’re at drive-thrus for coffee or at grocery stores, she asks me to pay for her stuff on my card so we can pay together and it’s “easier” and says she’ll pay me back, but never does. 

I don’t know if I’m cheap to be complaining about this because her stuff never exceeds $10 max, but it’s just the principle to me. She is almost never the one driving us around so I’m always the one paying at drive-thrus and after I pay it’s always “Do you want me to pay me back?” and never just “How much was mine?”. I’m kind of a people pleaser so that first question just feels like it’s implying that I shouldn’t need/want her to pay me back and I just end off saying no, but I don’t get why she has to frame the question that way. It’s also the fact that we both like taking occasional semi-long trips (2-3 hour round trip), but driving makes her anxious so I always drive, and idk is it not common courtesy to offer to buy the driver coffee or something OCCASIONALLY. I’m not going to keep track of how many miles I drove and ask for gas money every single time but…is that not just manners? How am I the one always driving and paying for both of our stuff 😭

She knows my family is a lot better off than hers, so I don’t know if she feels like it’s okay for me to constantly be paying for her stuff. I also don’t know if I just have no backbone and just need to talk to her about this, but I also feel stupid for bringing it up because she sometimes talks about how she’s had friends where she always paid for their meals and stuff even though they never paid her back. The question is, are some people just like this and take and take and don’t feel any shame or feel like they’re crossing any lines? Or am I just a bad friend for constantly thinking about times she hasn’t paid me back for stuff?",2,1759891808.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

I’ve been processing this pretty healthily, but grief isn’t linear and it’s been rough this month. It still feels so recent, but the fact that it’s been half a year just hit me hard, like the external flow of time and my internal perception of time are mismatched, making me feel ungrounded. 

I want to talk about this with my friends. What’s the best way to approach conversations about loss and grief without turning it into trauma dumping? I don’t want to ambush them, and I want to respect their boundaries as well as their capacity in the moment to process stuff like this. At the same time, we’re all so busy and usually hang out while grabbing coffee or a meal, I don’t know how they would feel about handling heavy topics over food and drinks. 

It feels like there isn’t a right time to bring it up, and it’s frustrating because I trust my friend and know for sure they would be supportive if there was only the right opportunity to talk.

I woke to the smell of stale cigarettes and frying oil and my mother’s voice sawing through the door like a rusted blade.

“Up, brat! You think the world will make room for your naps? Golden Capes don’t sleep till noon!”

It wasn’t noon. It was barely light. I rolled over and stared at the cracked paint on the ceiling, counting the hairline fractures like they were escape routes. Zula didn’t knock. She never knocked. The door banged open and she strode in with a pan in one hand and a cigarette in the other, like a war goddess who had replaced her spear with burnt eggs.

“You hear me?” she said, planting the pan on my desk. “Eat. Move. Or I’ll drag you by the ear like your good-for-nothing father.”

“Good morning to you too,” I muttered, sitting up. “Love the hospitality. Very uplifting.”

She squinted through smoke. “Sarcasm is for the weak. You want gold on your shoulders? Then suffer faster.”

I swung my legs out of bed, joints popping, and stood. Everything still ached from the last mission bruises stacked on bruises, the kind that blossom in sick colors. I pulled on my uniform while she paced and insulted the concept of idleness, Hugo’s knees, Melgor’s cowardice, and my alleged tendency to blink away from problems.

“I don’t blink away,” I said, mouth full of too-hot eggs. “I blink into worse ones.”

“Then blink into the kitchen when the dishes need washing.” She flicked ash at the sink and jabbed a finger at me. “And fix your stupid hair. You look like you lost a fight with a fan.”

“I did,” I said. “The fan won.”

She sniffed, the corner of her mouth betraying the smallest hint of a smile she’d deny under torture. “Eat faster.”

I shoveled the rest down and grabbed my gloves. The morning pressed at the window, the city a pale bruise beyond the grime. Zula stepped into my space and straightened my collar with the rough tenderness of someone who didn’t believe in tenderness.

“You’re walking like a corpse,” she said. “Hugo better beat the weakness out of you today.”

“He tries,” I said.

Her eyes softened in that dangerous, fleeting way. “Try back.”

I nodded. She flicked my forehead, hard. “Don’t get killed. Not before I can say ‘I told you so.’”

“Comforting,” I said.

I kissed her cheek anyway smoke, salt, and stubbornness and blinked. The apartment collapsed inward, the hallway stretched long as a throat, and the world flipped inside out as I stepped through the tear.

The Association unfolded beneath my feet: glass and steel, order polished to a cruel shine. I landed in a corridor washed with cold light and the metallic tang of disinfectant. The echoes of boots, the low hum of power dampeners in the walls, the banners that whispered promises I no longer fully believed. I breathed once, then again, and told myself I was stronger than yesterday. That I would keep moving. That gold was still a horizon, not a lie.

Zula’s voice chased me even here, like a warding spell. Don’t get killed. Try back.

I straightened my shoulders and went to find the only person who could out-grumble her and still make me feel steadier for it.

Hugo.

⸻

Hugo found me before I found him, because of course he did. He leaned against the training hall’s bulkhead like he’d grown out of it: scarred forearms folded, old eyes hard and amused. Today he wore the half-mended jacket that always smelled like oil and rain. His right hand was still flesh, but the skin there twitched in little ripples, promise of steel a thought away.

“You look like yesterday fell down the stairs and dragged you with it,” he said.

“Zula says hi,” I answered.

He grunted. “Tell her my knees hate her.”

“She’ll embroider that on a pillow.”

He jerked his chin toward the outer doors. “We’re up. Quick response. Red Zone trouble again. Different quadrant.” His mouth thinned. “They got heavy after last week.”

The words sank like stones. Last week: Russell, blood, cameras, applause. The noble district turned slaughterhouse while we posed as surgeons. “Media says we saved a thousand lives,” I said quietly.

“Media says a lot.” Hugo pushed off the wall. “We did what we did. They’re angrier now. More organized. Smarter.” He scratched the line of an old scar along his jaw. “And they’ve got two names worth remembering. Charles. Euder.”

“Powers?” I asked.

“Charles contact paralysis. Touches you and the lights go out in whatever he grabs. Not just numb dead electricity. Muscle dies by inches while you watch. If he gets your spine, you won’t feel the floor when it kisses you goodnight.”

My stomach went tight.

“Euder,” Hugo went on, voice flat, “is worse in slow motion. Says he makes ‘surgical threads.’ Not real. You won’t see them, you’ll just feel them. He perforates. Micro-punctures, precise. Collapses a lung from ten meters. Unzips a smile from ear to ear without lifting a finger. Likes to reshape people.” He paused. “Smiles while he works.”

“Charming,” I said, because if I didn’t say something, the quiet would dig into bone.

“We’re not alone.” Hugo nodded past me. A man in clean silver stepped up, young, eager, sharp around the edges the way we all are before the world files us down. Matheus. I’d seen him in passing, leading drills with the neatness of a ledger.

“Zenos,” he said, offering a hand I didn’t take because habits. He didn’t flinch. “I’ll coordinate. We have three civilian clusters in harm’s way. We block, we peel, we extract. No hero plays. Understood?”

“Understood,” I said.

“Russell coming?” he asked, tone carefully neutral.

“Not today,” Hugo said. Relief hid in the words like a sigh with a blade between its teeth. “Just us.”

Matheus breathed easier. “Good. He turns extractions into executions.”

No one argued. It hung between us: the memory of teeth on stone, laughter in blood. I thought of Sônia’s window and the city like a chessboard, of words about evolution and the weak being devoured, of Almair weighing lives in his palm like coins. I thought of gold, still burning my periphery like a sun I couldn’t stare into without going blind.

“Targets?” I asked.

“Shanty strip along the old viaduct,” Matheus said, sliding a tablet my way. Blue dots pulsed: civilians huddled in cinderblock alleys, a clinic with a flickering sign, a school with barred windows. Red triangulations like wounds: Charles. Euder. “We go in quiet, break their spear, drag people out before the gangs realize we don’t have numbers.”

“We never have numbers,” Hugo said. “We have decisions.”

Matheus looked at me. “Your teleport—can you move groups?”

“Short jumps,” I said. “If they hold on and don’t panic.”

“They’ll panic,” Hugo said. “Make them do it anyway.”

The klaxon on the wall flared, a low moan that warns more than it commands. Matheus sealed the tablet to his wrist. “We’re late,” he said simply. “Zenos?”

I nodded. The familiar dread slid cold under my ribs. The familiar stubbornness answered it. I stepped in close; Hugo’s hand found my shoulder, Matheus’s fingers gripped the fabric at my collarbone. The world gathered itself like a fist.

“Take us there,” Hugo said.

I closed my eyes and cut the city open.

⸻

We dropped into heat and stink and sirens—under the old viaduct where the city forgets its own bones. Concrete pillars rose like dead trees, painted with names and warnings and saints with hollow eyes. Smoke crawled along the ceiling in a low, ugly river. Somewhere a dog howled and didn’t stop.

Gunfire cracked three streets over. Screams stitched the gaps. The wind wasn’t wind; it was breath from hundreds of lungs pulling panic in and pushing it out, trying to stay alive.

Matheus went low and moved fast, two fingers to his ear, voice clipped. “Team Echo, where are my markers? We’re blind without the drones.”

Static answered. Then a voice, thin with fear: “Drone two down. Drone three… I—” The line cut. A second voice whispered a prayer hot with poor reception.

“Change of plan,” Hugo said. His right arm rippled into a wide shield studded with blunt teeth. His left hand stiffened into a short cleaver made for work, not theater. “We make our own markers.”

We slid along a cinderblock wall. A door opened boy no older than ten, hair stuck to his forehead, eyes too large in a face too thin. He stared at our capes like ghosts.

“Back inside,” Matheus whispered, steady palm pushing gently, pressure precise. “Under the bed. Stay. Do not open for any man with a badge unless his left shoulder is patched blue.” He pointed at his own patch. The boy nodded too fast and disappeared into dark.

The alley spat us onto a wider cut of street where the viaduct spit lumps of broken concrete. Three civilians hunched behind a tipped refrigerator; a woman pressed a towel to an old man’s thigh, red soaking through like the sea climbing sand. A teenager with a cracked skateboard held a kitchen knife and didn’t know where to put his eyes.

“Matheus,” I said, already stepping.

“I see them,” he said. “Move.”

I blinked to the far side of the street. The world snapped; my stomach lurched; I touched the man’s shoulder. “Hold on to me,” I told him, but he was drifting, drowning behind his eyes. The teenager grabbed my sleeve. The woman didn’t ask permission; she clutched my belt, jaw set like the world owed her breath.

I blinked again and they spilled into the alley where we’d come, tumbling into shadow. “Blue patch,” I shouted at the doorway where the boy’s eyes gleamed. “Only blue patch!”

He nodded, knuckles white on the frame.

Hugo covered us, shield swallowing a spray of bullets that sparked and screamed. He answered with a cough of metal the stubby barrel he’d grown along the shield’s rim spitting three cruel barks. The gunmen folded like cheap chairs.

Matheus dragged a trash bin to fortify the alley mouth. “Two more clusters,” he said. “Clinic east school north. We split—”

“Negative,” Hugo said before he finished. “Charles and Euder hunt in pairs, and we haven’t seen them. We stay a fist, not fingers.”

A sound like metal sighing bled down the street. It took me a heartbeat to realize it was the viaduct itself humming, not with trucks but with something meaner. The hairs on my arms lifted.

“They’re close,” Matheus said. “Zenos—”

“On you,” I said.

We moved. Under a mural of a mother with eight arms and a halo of nails, past a burning scooter, past a girl sitting on a curb hugging a cat that had decided not to run. The clinic’s sign a tooth painted like a cartoon flickered and died as we arrived. Inside: old tiles, older disinfectant, metal cabinets with braces and crutches and desperate hope.

A nurse with silver in her hair and red in her eyes pointed at three bunk beds shoved along a wall. “Children,” she said, breath hitching. “I can carry two.”

“You’ll carry none,” Hugo said. “You’ll guide.” He turned to me. “You’re the door. Open it.”

They pressed in: soft hair, shaking shoulders, hot cheeks wet with tears that didn’t make a sound. I split the distance, the world bending wrong as I took ten at a time in short, ugly jumps: clinic to alley, alley to a safer stairwell we’d marked with chalk, back again. I tasted bile and kept moving. Matheus counted, steered, placed bodies where they wouldn’t be crushed when panic stampeded.

On the third shuttle, the clinic’s front window sighed inward. Not shattered—sliced. A crisp rectangle lowered itself from empty air and set gently on the floor like a platter at a party.

A man stepped through the hole he’d made.

Tall. Hair cropped short. Skin the color of coffee with too much milk. Hands clean. Smile neat and unhurried, as if he’d kept us waiting and was pleased to do so.

“Euder,” Hugo said, and his voice did a thing I didn’t like.

Euder’s fingers twitched in invisible thread. The nurse made a small sound and touched her cheek. When her hand came away, blood laced her fingers like thin red stitching.

“Hello,” Euder said, voice soft as a clinic’s waiting room. “No need to run. We’re just here to rearrange.”

And then another shadow moved at his back, quiet as dust. Charles. He didn’t smile. He didn’t need to. He flexed his fingers like a pianist about to begin.

I blinked toward the children and missed. The room reeked of alcohol and fear and something thin and metallic I would later learn to call micro-bleed. Hugo stepped into the doorway, shield wide, body low.

“Matheus,” he said, without looking. “Close ranks.”

Matheus swallowed. “On me.”

The first needle we didn’t see opened my knuckle like a zipper. The second stole the nurse’s breath. The third wrote my name along my ribs in tiny punctures that promised a story I would not like.

I bared my teeth. “On me,” I said—and tore the world again.

⸻

If you ask me later what I remember first, it isn’t the blood. It’s the way the clinic’s fluorescent lights trembled in their housings, buzzing like trapped wasps, as if the room knew we were about to teach it a new noun for fear.

I blinked hard, fast, dragging three kids and the silver-haired nurse into the alley and shoving them toward the chalked stairwell where a dozen survivors huddled with a tin crucifix and a broken mop for courage. “Blue patch!” I shouted again, voice frayed. “Blue patch, blue patch, blue patch—”

I turned back and blinked into the clinic as Euder stepped forward like a man coming to the counter to order tea.

“Do you know,” he said conversationally, “how many holes a lung can carry before it forgets to float?”

Hugo didn’t answer. He drove his shield into the man’s chest with a noise like a car kissing a wall. Euder slid backward, shoes squealing against tile and then the shield bled. Not red. It bled shavings of itself, tiny curls of steel falling from its face as if someone had peeled them with invisible hands.

“Craftsmanship,” Euder murmured, admiring Hugo’s arm like a butcher admiring marbling. “Let’s improve it.”

Hugo swore and reformed the edge, jaw clenched so hard the muscles in his neck stood double. He lunged again, cleaver hand flashing. The air between them filled with a soft, obscene sound like fabric tearing.

Matheus went for Charles. Wrong choice, right necessity. Charles moved like gravity—inevitable, close, more force than speed. Matheus feinted left; Charles let him; Matheus pivoted and drove a short baton at the man’s ribs, clean as a drill.

Charles caught his forearm.

It wasn’t dramatic. No crack, no scream. Matheus’s face just changed. A freeze, a confusion, a dawning horror as his right hand forgot it had ever learned to close. The baton slid from his fingers and clattered to tile. Charles’s other hand found Matheus’s shoulder. He pressed gently as a father might adjust a son’s jacket before a photograph.

Matheus’s shoulder died. You could see it: how the muscle slackened and surrendered in a circle under Charles’s palm, a flower closing the wrong way. Matheus tried to pull free. His right leg didn’t listen.

I blinked to them and grabbed Matheus’s collar. Charles’s fingers scraped my wrist a brush, a kiss, nothing and my thumb went out. The sensation didn’t travel; it colonized. It crept. I felt the map of my own hand go dark in neat territories.

I yanked anyway and blinked us two meters left. We reappeared among toppled trays and clean gauze spilled like snow. Matheus gasped, sweat springing from his face in an instant. “I can’t my arm Zenos—”

“I know,” I said, fighting the urge to shake feeling back into my own hand like that ever helps. “Stay behind me. Stay—”

A thread kissed my cheek. I didn’t see it; I felt the after. Warmth bloomed in a thin line and fell in a drop that landed hot on my lip. I tasted metal. Euder’s smile widened by a millimeter.

“Lines,” he said. “We are all lines waiting to be drawn.”

Hugo charged him, and for a heartbeat the old man was a cathedral of murder: shield high, edge low, stance perfect despite the crooked knee and the thousand aches. He took three steps through an invisible rain of holes and made his own door, cleaver biting for Euder’s throat.

A sound like wind through reeds. Hugo’s left bicep opened in neat, round dots, spaced like lesson marks. His cleaver faltered. Euder’s hand flicked twice like a conductor calling the violins.

Hugo’s left arm came apart.

Not off. Apart. You could see the architecture of him the fibers, the artificial anchorings, the seams where steel met meat and watch as Euder outlined it all in absence. Hugo’s mouth filled with a noise I’d only heard once before, when a man realized the fire would have him no matter how fast he ran.

He dropped to one knee and punched his shield forward, last act of a stubborn saint. Euder stepped sideways, patient, and wrote a circle through the air with two fingers.

Hugo’s throat blossomed.

I moved without deciding. The world tore. I was behind Euder, above him, anywhere but where I’d been. My boot found the back of his knee and folded it. My hand—my failing hand—clawed for his eyes.

He didn’t even look at me. His palm brushed air.

My forearm lit with a constellation of holes so small you’d need a fresh sin to see them. The muscle spasmed. My grip failed.

“Not yet,” Euder said, mild. “I’ve only started with you.”

Behind him, Hugo tried to stand. He did it the way he did everything: contrary to common sense. He convinced his body it would obey because he refused the alternative. He got half his weight under him and levered the shield up again.

Charles arrived.

He put one hand on Hugo’s spine and the other on the back of Hugo’s skull and pushed, not hard. Hugo arched. For a moment I thought Charles would snap him. He didn’t. He just held on the way you hold a door shut against a draft.

Hugo went still. The change ran down him like frost on a window—back first, then shoulders, then the cords of his neck, then his jaw. His eyes found me through the mask of a man whose body had forgotten him.

“Boy,” he said around the failing hinge of his mouth. “Run.”

“I won’t,” I said, because my throat was a box of nails and none of them would let a different word out.

“Stupid,” he said, almost fond. It came out slurred. “Good.”

Euder drew two more lines in the air. They were barely gestures; they were verdicts. Hugo’s shield slumped. The cleaver slid from a hand that was a memory. He folded to the floor like a church closing.

A sound hit the clinic window. High. Wet. Wrong. I turned and should not have. Matheus—Matheus—had bought the schoolchildren four minutes with a map and a tone of voice you trust in fire. He’d herded them down a back hall and into a storeroom and stacked boxes where bullets might think twice.

He didn’t make it to the fourth minute.

Charles found him by the door, arms wide as if he could be big enough to block vengeance with his chest. Charles touched his sternum. Matheus looked offended for a second and then realized he’d forgotten how to breathe. He took a step and his legs answered in another language. Charles guided him down against the jamb like setting a heavy book on a shelf.

Euder flicked. Matheus’s left eye watered red. He blinked against it like a man swatting a mosquito. Euder drew another small circle and the red became too much to blink.

“Stop,” I heard myself say, too human, useless.

“Why?” Euder said without turning. “We’re improving him.”

Something broke in my voice. A bad sound. A boy sound. I hated it. I loved what it confessed. I grabbed the world again ugly, split-second, blind and threw myself at them with the only power I had that didn’t need room to land.

Charles let go of Matheus and caught me by the jaw.

Just fingertips along the angle of bone, like a lover. Darkness sizzled into my tongue. I tried to blink and found that the part of me that makes that trick true had been turned off like a switch. Paralysis isn’t pain. It’s subtraction. It is the terrible lesson that your will is not a god.

Euder stepped close, curious, delighted. “So many lines,” he murmured, eyes tracing my face like a cartographer mapping a coast. “Let’s see where they lead.”

He wrote in the air again and something opened along my thigh—no dramatic slice, just the sudden knowledge that blood could be warm and cold at once. I would have fallen if Charles’s grip had not taught my legs a new obedience. I couldn’t tell if I was shaking. I couldn’t tell if my heart was fast or refusing like everything else.

Behind them, the nurse gathered a child who had come back because children are brave in all the wrong ways. She put her body between tiny bones and incoming ruin. This is heroism nobody films. Euder filleted her courage with a single, precise gesture that laced her shoulder to her ribs with holes like a stitched confession. She didn’t drop the child. She just learned a new way to hurt.

“Enough,” I croaked, because words were the only piece of me that still remembered me. “Take me. Leave them.”

“Tempting,” Euder said. “But I haven’t finished your friend.”

Matheus found one last pocket of himself that wasn’t broken and used it to spit blood and say, “Zenos, don’t—”

Charles pressed his palm to Matheus’s throat.

The light in Matheus’s eyes didn’t go out all at once. It guttered like a candle in a room where the window won’t latch. He stayed there too long, staring at me, trying to hand me a duty I didn’t deserve and couldn’t refuse. Then he slid sideways and the doorframe took him gently like an old tree receiving a bird.

I made a sound I never want anyone I love to hear. Charles watched me make it. There was no joy in him; there was only the certainty of a tool in a hand that knows the job.

“Your turn,” Euder said, and lifted his hand to draw lines I would carry for the rest of my life.

The world did not slow. It did not break into inspiring pieces. It pressed its full weight onto my chest and asked me whether I meant what I had told my mother and my father and my lover and myself. Whether I would try back.

I could not move.

So I did the only thing left to me.

I remembered.

Hugo’s barked laugh in the training hall. Zula’s smoke-bitten kiss to the cheek. Elis’s fingers crooked in mine like a promise. The boy in the doorway clutching courage in a small palm. The nurse refusing to drop a child. The way a city sounds when it still believes it might be worth saving.

“Gold,” I said through a mouth that wasn’t sure it could be mine. “You can keep it.”

Euder’s eyebrows lifted, amused. “We intend to.”

He drew the next line.

Everything after that was blood and steam and sirens, and the taste of grief like coins under my tongue.",3,1759891737.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

I’ve been processing this pretty healthily, but grief isn’t linear and it’s been rough this month. It still feels so recent, but the fact that it’s been half a year just hit me hard, like the external flow of time and my internal perception of time are mismatched, making me feel ungrounded. 

I want to talk about this with my friends. What’s the best way to approach conversations about loss and grief without turning it into trauma dumping? I don’t want to ambush them, and I want to respect their boundaries as well as their capacity in the moment to process stuff like this. At the same time, we’re all so busy and usually hang out while grabbing coffee or a meal, I don’t know how they would feel about handling heavy topics over food and drinks. 

It feels like there isn’t a right time to bring it up, and it’s frustrating because I trust my friend and know for sure they would be supportive if there was only the right opportunity to talk.

1o0z214,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0z214,Printago's Etsy Integration Preview,"Hi everyone! I'm Matt, one of the co-founders of Printago, and I'm really excited to give you a sneak peek at what we're submitting to Etsy for review in just a few days!

# What It Does

* **Connect to your Etsy account** and Printago will check for new orders every 5 minutes.
* **Orders automatically go into your queue** and configure themselves with the correct color and personalization options (for OpenSCAD models!)
* Our **SKU Options/Parameters system** means you *don't* need a separate SKU for every color or variant of a model. You can keep a listing-level single SKU, and let the variants map into Printago. Set once, and done.
* **Personalization and sizing options** pass directly to OpenSCAD parts for automatic on-demand rendering. Great for personalized objects! This includes our support for multi-color **ColorSCAD** files for automatic painting!
* **Import SKUs** from your Etsy account into Printago (you'll need to add parts to them and configure the SKUs once).
* **Export SKUs** from your Printago account to Etsy! We use your draft listings as templates. If you need to add 50 cookie cutters that are all configured the same in Etsy, just make a draft listing with stock videos and pictures that will be the same in each listing, as well as the description. Additional per-SKU description will be put at the beginning of the description. The new Etsy listing will remain in draft state where you can upload photos and then publish! Store sections, pricing, variants - all set.
* **Etsy Export to CSV** (coming soon) - Need to export your Etsy listings to Shopify? Just choose a section of your store and export it. It will export a Shopify-compatible file ready to upload to Shopify. Already existing listings just get updated when you re-upload the file to Shopify.

# Pricing

The cost for the add-on is planned at **$20/month**, and that covers the first $1,000 of orders that flow through our system. After you make $1,000 each month, we'll charge 2% of the additional transactions (e.g., if you make $1,500 in November, you'd pay $20 + 2% of $500 = $10).

**We're not charging per API call** like many other services do - we think that's super lame.

# Our Evolving Pricing Strategy

As we move towards features that are coupled with e-commerce, we'll be slowly deprioritizing the ""per slot"" cost of Printago. We already allow unlimited printers to be connected for free, however our strategy has been to charge for ""production slots"" that represent the number of jobs we'll run from the Printago queue at a time for you. But that still punishes users for growing their farms.

As we roll out these add-on features, our plan is to offer a **""cap"" on the cost of the core service**, regardless of the number of printers you have connected!

We're working hard on the next set of features to continue to make Printago the most powerful and useful print farm software in the market. **Made for Businesses!**  As usual you can find me and my co-founder on our Discord server pretty much 24/7 ready to help anyone get started or take feature requests!",1,1759891651.0,BambuP1S,0,0.67,False

Rent’s insane, groceries somehow doubled, and I still end up broke even when I barely go out. So I started paying closer attention to where my money was going, and a few small changes actually helped a lot.

Here’s what’s been working for me lately:

1. Track where your money leaks.  
Not in some fancy Excel sheet, just write it down for a week. I realised half my money was disappearing into snacks, coffee, and random Uber rides. Once you actually see it, you’ll start adjusting naturally.

2. Automate the boring stuff.  
Rent, savings, bills, anything that can be on autopay, put it there. I used to forget payments all the time and end up stressed. Now it’s just one less thing to think about.

3. Don’t sleep on student discounts.  
Spotify, Notion, Apple, Adobe, Amazon, they all have them. Feels small in the moment, but saving $5–10 here and there adds up to a few hundred a year.

4. Be smart with shared costs.  
If you split rent, groceries, or takeout with friends, track it properly. “I’ll Venmo you later” can turn into a small debt pile real quick.

5. Learn a couple easy meals and rotate them.  
You don’t need to meal prep like a pro. I just learned a few cheap meals I don’t hate, pasta, burrito bowls, breakfast wraps, and rotate them through the week. Saves me at least $80–100 a month on takeout.

6. Save something, even if it’s tiny.  
I started with $10 a week. It’s not the amount that matters, it’s the habit. Once it becomes routine, it gets way easier to scale up.

7. Say no sometimes.  
The biggest budget killer is social pressure. Every “come on, it’s just one drink” adds up. Most people are secretly broke too, they just hide it better.

8. Learn the basics about credit and interest.  
Understanding how credit works, what utilisation means, and why minimum payments trap you, that’s real adult power. Start early, even if it feels boring now.

You don’t need to be rich to feel in control. You just need to stop money from slipping away without realising it. Once you get a few small systems in place, the stress goes way down.",6,1759891585.0,budget,0,1.0,False

1o0z0rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o0z0rj/everybody_loves_a_happy_family/,EvErYbody loVeS A HapPy fAmIlY,"Have you ever had an experience that is so visceral and surreal that it follows you every day for the rest of your life? One that makes you second guess or hesitate to do anything that may put you in the same situation? If you haven't already guessed, I have.

I was very down on my luck at the time, no job, no family, and subsequently, no home. My days consisted of moving around, being as I was homeless at the time, I didn't stay in one spot for very long. I'd had a nasty break up with my then-girlfriend and left with nothing more than a backpack with some clothes and a blanket. I didn't even have a phone.

One particular day I decided to move on to yet another town, yet I had no specific destination. I simply picked a direction and carried on my way. I found myself walking along some back roads that took me further and further into bum fucked nowhere, with only the occasional wooded areas ever couple of miles on either side of the road. I wasn't even sure how long I'd been walking, but night fell and the road in front of me was getting dark.

Any source of light was obstructed by thick storm clouds that made it difficult to navigate. There was no telling how far the nearest civilization was, and if that wasn't bad enough it soon started pouring rain. I pulled my hood over my head and trudged through it. I'd begun to worry that I'd be walking for several hours before reaching any semblance of shelter. I hadn't seen a car pass for I don't know how long.

I kept pace as fast as possible until I came across what looked to be a house that I spotted through a clearing of thick trees. I contemplated for a moment, not sure what to do. Eventually I decided it would be best if I tried to see if I could hunker down, at least until the rain dissipated. The house was pretty far back into the trees down a narrow dirt road. As I approached, I saw that the one-story house seemed old and run down. I noticed the shutters on the windows were closed.

I reached the porch and knocked, to be honest I was a little nervous about who I might encounter out in the middle of nowhere, where basically anything could happen. There was no answer, so I knocked again. I waited for a couple minutes before hesitantly turning the knob.

As I entered, I was met with the smell of stale air and it was pitch black. ""Hello?"" I called out. ""Anyone home?"" Silence... I felt along the wall until I found a light switch, though nothing happened when I flipped it. I shut the door to keep the rain out and let my eyes adjust to the room. I squinted through the darkness, surveying the living room, it was rectangular in structure.

To the far left sat a small couch with an armchair across from it, separated by a coffee table. Across from me was a doorway leading to what I presumed to be the kitchen, and directly to my right was a coat rack. Aside from the furniture, the rest of the living room only consisted of a bookcase, and photos that hung loosely from the walls.

Hoping that maybe the electricity was only briefly knocked out by the storm I searched for a breaker box. In the kitchen was a door that led to a basement. The only other door was the back door, which was boarded up as well. ""Great."" I thought. ""The breaker box would be in a creepy basement of a house that was tailor made for horror movies.""

I cautiously descended the creaky stairs as I struggled to find my footing in the darkness. The basement was filled with random boxes as far as I could see, along with a few baskets full of clothes. I spotted the breaker box and tried to flip it. To my disappointment nothing happened. I sighed, gathering that no one has lived here for a while. I found it odd, however, that it seemed as though most of the occupants' belongings were left behind.

I climbed the stairs once more returning to the living room. The storm outside raged on as I contemplated where to sleep. I found one of the bedrooms and peered in. Everything appeared normal, save for the fact that it seemed like nobody had slept here for some time. The bed was made, and family photos decorated the walls.

The open closet revealed clothes still hanging up. It was so difficult to see because even the windows in this room were boarded up from the inside. I felt a bit strange about sleeping in someone else's bed so I decided to sleep on the couch. I laid down listening to the rain until I eventually drifted off.

Do you ever have times in which something wakes you up but it takes you a while to realize what it was? Well that's what happened to me, not to mention forgetting where I was. I looked around, again waiting for my eyes to adjust. I noticed the rain had mellowed out some but that wasn't it. As I squinted around the room I noticed something out of place. I couldn't tell you why I even noticed. The coat rack.

That's when I noticed the breathing. My eyes scanned their way to the chair across from me. My blood turned to ice. I could see the form of what I initially believed to be that of a coat rack sitting directly across from me, leaning forward in the chair, only mere feet from my face. He wore an old hat, though I couldn't make out any details of his face.

I was paralyzed with fear. My breathing was shaky despite my attempt to keep calm, his own raspy breathing stopped as he must have noticed my awareness. His head slowly turned to the side. That was all it took. I jumped up and scrambled for the door, nearly falling. I pulled on the door to no avail, looking closely I saw padlocks on the door that I hadn't noticed before.

In my current state of panic I made a break for the basement, being that all other windows and doors were boarded up. I nearly tumbled down the stairs after slamming the door behind me. I stood with my hands clasped tightly around the doorknob, holding it closed. I listened for any movement and soon heard footsteps creeping slowly toward the door.

The floor creaked beneath his feet as he stopped at the door. The only sound I could hear over my own breathing was that of the man on the other side of the door. His breathing was slow and raspy, and almost animalistic. I stood holding the door for what seemed like forever, listening to the breathing. I was waiting for the moment that whoever was on the other side would force his way in. I thought he'd never leave until I heard the footsteps of the man as he walked away.

Moments later I heard the sound of a lock being undone, and the sound of the front door opening and closing. After a few minutes of silence I let go of the door, I hadn't realized I'd been gripping the doorknob so tightly my hand was sore. I was still to paranoid to open the door, so I decided I needed to find something, anything that I could defend myself with.

I made my way back down the steps and started rummaging through the basement, I listened carefully for any movement upstairs. I'd just about given up when my foot had hit something. I reached down, fumbling in the darkness until I found a flashlight. I thought I would feel some relief when I turned it on, but once I scanned the basement with it I found something that made me sick.

At first, when the light illuminated the laundry baskets, I had no clue what I was looking at. I approached slowly, and what I saw, my eyes refused to believe. Flesh, all of which was treated, as if it were leather. I tried to convince myself it was that of animals as I took a closer look, until I noticed the faces. Human faces, several of them amidst various other skins from who knows how many people. That wasn't all, I found something else, rested on a metal chair next to the baskets was a yellow notepad.

My mind was racing, it told me I should just focus on a way out and never look back but my curiosity got the best of me given the circumstances. I picked up the notepad and read the first page.

""We ask only to be reassured about the noises in the cellar and the window that should not have been open."" It read.

I flipped to the next page.

""One need not be a chamber to be haunted. One need not be a house. The brain has corridors surpassing material place.""

I kept flipping pages.

""Stare at the dark too long and you will eventually see what isn’t there.""

""Maybe all the schemes of the devil were nothing compared to what man could think up.""

""I don’t live in darkness, darkness lives in me.""

On and on it went, each page containing macabre phrases, most of which stained with smears of what seemed to be dried blood. I decided then that I had to get the fuck out of this God-forsaken house by any means necessary.

I still hadn't heard anything since the man left the house, so I put the notepad aside and crept back up the stairs, careful not to make too much noise. Slowly I opened the basement door and peeked out. Although I saw nothing moving, I was still cautious to say the least. I made my way through the kitchen and into the living room. Without hesitating I pulled the door open. My stomach dropped.

As I aimed the flashlight directly in front of me I saw a face I would never forget. His skin was withered and pale. His wild eyes were grey and almost unnaturally wide. He was sickly thin, wearing clothes much too big for him that were stained with what was most likely blood. His hair was tangled and matted. The man's mouth hung open revealing rotted teeth. For a moment I couldn't move, the cold, emotionless expression he wore was paralyzing. The eyes were so distant and yet I felt as if they were digging their way into my soul.

I slowly started to back up, and as I did so I saw the man's open mouth turn into a frown, and his blank expression turned into an angry grimace, as if he were disgusted beyond measure. I turned and ran to the first door I saw. As I reached the bedroom once u I heard the footsteps of the man behind me, his breath turning into a desperate growl.

I barreled into the room and was barely able to shut the door behind me before he slammed into it. I quickly reached for the knob and locked it. I kept my back to the door as I listened to his raspy breathing, after a few attempts at opening the door, he stopped. Then suddenly he broke out into a maniacal laughter, rambling incomprehensible gibberish. I had to find a way out as soon as possible.

As I turned the light toward the window that was boarded up, something caught my eye. The pictures. The families in the photos, and I mean different families in each picture that adorned the wall, were all mutilated and made to pose in different ways. Faces were forced into bloody, toothless smiles with hooks through their cheeks. Eyes were removed. Bodies were sewn together in a horrific embrace resembling a hug. Mouths were sewn to one another as if they were kissing.

Then as I moved the light toward the closet, I made yet another horrific discovery. Like the laundry hampers in the basement, in which were what I assumed to be nothing more than clothes, I found even more human flesh. Entire torsos of people were hanging from the rack, also seemingly treated as if it were leather. I felt sick. The whole situation was beyond anything I'd ever expect to experience. All the while the man continued to laugh and ramble unintelligibly.

""What do you want?"" I shouted breathlessly. The laughter stopped suddenly. I listened intently, hearing only the raspy breathing of the man. ""Just a happy family, I love to see a happy family."" he said in a low, animated voice. Then suddenly he proceeded to kick at the door, every loud bang was accompanied by a screeching bellow.

I knew if I didn't act quickly, I'd be killed, and likely turned into the casual apparel of a fucking sadist. To the left of the door was an armoire, with a surge of adrenaline i strained to push it in front of the door, tipping it over in the process. The scenery before me was almost too gruesome for my mind to make sense of it as one of the armoire doors swung open upon hitting the doorknob. Multiple severed human heads cascaded out onto the floor, all of them were maimed, and disfigured.

It was only the will to survive that drove me into a frenzy. I scrambled to the barricaded bedroom window and began driving my foot into it as the man continued to do the same to the door. I kicked and kicked with everything I had until the wood finally gave way. I tore away at the boards until I had full access to the window. To my dismay I found that it was also nailed shut. The crazed lunatic on the other side of the bedroom door seemed to be growing more frantic, and his shouting grew more hysterical.

Without thinking twice I grabbed the end table next to the bed and heaved it at the window. After two tries the window gave way with a satisfying shatter. Adrenaline still rushed through my veins as I climbed out and wasted no time sprinting into the direction of the trees. Moments after I took off running I heard the sound of the man bursting from the front door, and the maniacal laughter as I ran. I could only assume he didn't give chase as the chaotic sounds faded behind me.

I ran until my legs were on fire, until my blood turned to acid, and then I ran some more. I don't know how long I'd been running until I finally reached a road. Almost out of pure luck I spotted a car traveling by. I stepped into the middle of the road waving both hands like a lunatic as the car approached. I breathlessly told the driver that I needed the police. ""Call... Police... People... Murdered..."" Was all I could choke out. Luckily he obliged.

I did my best to explain to the cops exactly what happened in detail. Of course they were a bit skeptical, a sweaty, homeless drifter giving them a story about a murder situation undreamed of by even the most seasoned of homicide detectives. I was taken to the nearby police department to give a formal statement. I told them of the notepad, the human leather garments, and gave the description of the man I'd seen.

Then the unthinkable happened. I was told that not only was the man nowhere to be found, but that the house itself was empty save for the furniture. The hampers were gone, the closets were empty, the armoire contained nothing at all, nor were there any disfigured family photos or severed heads. It was assumed by the police that the occupants that lived there had simply picked up and moved, leaving most of their belongings behind.

I tried to convince them, but I was told that if I didn't want to be charged with falsifying a police report and destruction of property that I'd better just leave immediately. As discouraged as I was I didn't want to push my luck, since I was especially lucky to make it out of there.

Months went by and I'd actually started to find a foothold in my life again despite the psychological trauma I'd faced. In fact it seemed to give me a fresh outlook on life. I actually reconnected with my ex, and eventually rekindled our relationship. I started a decent paying job, and proposed, and was surprised soon after to find out that my wife was pregnant. With our newfound stability, we decided it was time to move being that she was going to pop any day, and we needed a bigger house. We found a house out in the country that was a perfect fit, closer to my job, and far away from the shit that haunted me. Things were going great.

After we were completely moved, we had a little housewarming party and invited some friends. I spent most of the time at the grill, having a few beers and laughs with the guys. My wife stayed inside with the woman doing the things that woman do when they congregate. I caught myself spacing out for a moment, thinking of my experience, I never talked about it to anyone except my wife.

""Hey babe, do you know where the photo album is?"" Sabrina asked, bringing me back to the present.

""Umm... Not sure love, honestly the last time I've seen it was at the apartment, didn't you pack it?"" I responded.

""No... I thought you did."" She said curtly. I shook my head with a sigh. ""Last I saw it was a couple weeks before we moved.""

""Damn."" She grumbled. ""They wanted to see the ultrasound. And it gives me an excuse to show them your baby pictures and stuff."" She gave me a devious grin.

"" Well God forbid that would be missing. "" I laughed. ""Anyways, it might turn up somewhere.""

The guests stayed around for a couple more hours before it was time to wrap it up and go home. The rest of the night was spent relaxing in front of the tv until Sabrina fell asleep in my arms, so I shut the lights off and headed for bed. I felt like things were going perfectly, which isn't something I'm accustomed to. It seemed as though I was starting to adapt since the incident, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't fuck with me from time to time, especially in my dreams.

The next day I woke up relatively early and couldn't fall back asleep. I had a few hours before work so I sat on the couch in front of the tv, drinking my morning coffee. I didn't like sitting idly. Once the memories creep in I become restless and try to occupy my mind with anything. I noticed the sound of rain as I sat fixated on nothing in particular, and it brought me back to that night.

I stood and made my way to the front door and stepped out, taking in the scenery of the grey sky, reliving that night in my mind. Above all else I felt like I was at the point that maybe I could move on from my experience one step at a time. That was until I turned around to go back inside. I noticed something resting against the house next to the front door.

It was a backpack... A very familiar one. I reached out a shaky hand with trepidation, picking up the bag. Walking slowly, I carried it inside I dropped it on the couch. I could only stare at it for several moments before I finally gathered the nerve to look inside. As I slowly unzipped the bag, I don't know what I expected to find, I just felt it was going to bring me back to the panic I felt in that hellhole of a house.

As I peered in, to my surprise I only found the clothes I had packed in it when I was traveling. That was until I spotted something else. I pulled out a very familiar large binder, that was formed into a photo album. I felt bile rise up in my throat as I opened it, each and every page displayed all of the family photos that it had always contained, only every one of them had what seemed to be blood smeared in the form of a smiley face covering them. Parents, grandparents, siblings, nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, and uncles.

I kept flipping, and flipping pages, until I came to the last and final photo. My heart lurched in my chest. The ultrasound. Blood was stained upon it in a smile like the rest. On the page to the right of it was a ripped-out page from a yellow notepad. In unmistakable handwriting it read ""Planning on adding to the family? So am I.""

And beneath that it read ""Everyone wants a happy family.""",1,1759891549.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1o0yzoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurantowners/comments/1o0yzoy/outsource_bookkeeping/,Outsource Bookkeeping?,"I’m wondering, is there a size or type of restaurant where you think doing your own bookkeeping would be practical and sensible, as opposed to hiring a bookkeeping service?

One of my friends works for a very good bookkeeping company, they do many of the restaurants in town, so I have access to that service.  But it isn’t cheap either - I’m not saying their service isn’t worth every penny, but it’s a non-trivial number of pennies.

We’re looking at starting a small cafe - only about 700 sf public space, a couple steps up from a “coffee shop” but very modest compared to the full-fat restaurants that you guys/gals have.

I have my own business, it is in financial services and very simple in an inflow/outflow sense.  I’ve always done my own bookkeeping, click through Quicken putting every expense in its category, it is pretty easy.  But again, it is a simple business.  Maybe it wouldn’t be as easy to bookkeep a cafe.

What do you think?

What information are you trying to extract from your books?  What analyses do you run?  How often are you running those numbers - daily, weekly?  How many different expensive and income categories do you need to track?  If you do your own books, how many hours/week does it take?  How have you made it as automated as possible?

1o0yym0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0yym0,Printago Etsy Integration Preview,"Hi everyone! I'm Matt, one of the co-founders of Printago, and I'm really excited to give you a sneak peek at what we're submitting to Etsy for review in just a few days!

# What It Does

* **Connect to your Etsy account** and Printago will check for new orders every 5 minutes.
* **Orders automatically go into your queue** and configure themselves with the correct color and personalization options (for OpenSCAD models!)
* Our **SKU Options/Parameters system** means you *don't* need a separate SKU for every color or variant of a model. You can keep a listing-level single SKU, and let the variants map into Printago. Set once, and done.
* **Personalization and sizing options** pass directly to OpenSCAD parts for automatic on-demand rendering. Great for personalized objects! This includes our support for multi-color **ColorSCAD** files for automatic painting!
* **Import SKUs** from your Etsy account into Printago (you'll need to add parts to them and configure the SKUs once).
* **Export SKUs** from your Printago account to Etsy! We use your draft listings as templates. If you need to add 50 cookie cutters that are all configured the same in Etsy, just make a draft listing with stock videos and pictures that will be the same in each listing, as well as the description. Additional per-SKU description will be put at the beginning of the description. The new Etsy listing will remain in draft state where you can upload photos and then publish! Store sections, pricing, variants - all set.
* **Etsy Export to CSV** (coming soon) - Need to export your Etsy listings to Shopify? Just choose a section of your store and export it. It will export a Shopify-compatible file ready to upload to Shopify. Already existing listings just get updated when you re-upload the file to Shopify.

# Pricing

The cost for the add-on is planned at **$20/month**, and that covers the first $1,000 of orders that flow through our system. After you make $1,000 each month, we'll charge 2% of the additional transactions (e.g., if you make $1,500 in November, you'd pay $20 + 2% of $500 = $10).

**We're not charging per API call** like many other services do - we think that's super lame.

# Our Evolving Pricing Strategy

As we move towards features that are coupled with e-commerce, we'll be slowly deprioritizing the ""per slot"" cost of Printago. We already allow unlimited printers to be connected for free, however our strategy has been to charge for ""production slots"" that represent the number of jobs we'll run from the Printago queue at a time for you. But that still punishes users for growing their farms.

As we roll out these add-on features, our plan is to offer a **""cap"" on the cost of the core service**, regardless of the number of printers you have connected!

We're working hard on the next set of features to continue to make Printago the most powerful and useful print farm software in the market. **Made for Businesses!**  As usual you can find me and my co-founder on our Discord server pretty much 24/7 ready to help anyone get started or take feature requests!",0,1759891375.0,3Dprinting,0,0.5,False

1o0yy7y,https://i.redd.it/ysbzqwaiwstf1.jpeg,"Sometimes I think about the life I had and feel like it wasn’t that bad, even despite GD and my chad status","Because I wasn’t trans I had multiple friends I hung out with, I had great time in summer camps I was put into. I always remember being decently popular and being like the go to kid. I didn’t dissociate because my friends unironically helped me cope. I had girl friends who would go to foot ball games with me, that I’d go on excursions with. Sometimes we’d go on coffee dates.

With my guy friends we’d party, meet people, smoke weed, and drive fast cars. They would go like 130-160 mph. They would love rapping, and even taught me how to rap. We would crash over at peoples houses, and through these people I met my first GF. She was a complete stoner and actually really funny. Hahaha I remember we’d leave school just to get high and eat out. I remember going to new school and having kids already know me which was kinda weird and cool. They’d be like, we’ve heard you did some crazy stuff at the other school. It was almost like a movie. 

Then I went to prom with this girl I loved talking to after I broke up with my ex. She still calls me to this day. My friends and I never talked about religion or politics which was really nice. Then I finished high school and it all changed.

~ i twink died, and age pill fucked me up. I finally stopped repping and came out as trans. That’s after I realized this shit doesn’t go away ( thanks to speaking to elder trans folks… I lost my best friend because I came out as trans. He also stopped talking to me because of drugs. My friends all came out as deep MAGA republicans. I realized that in order to pass I gotta skinny max and surgery max which deteriorated my mental health. My dad started drinking heavily. I started to have to pay 1000’s of dollars in medical bills to transition thanks to unstable levels and labs. I discovered 4tran4 and my mental health deteriorated more ( thanks to me realizing the reality of my situation). I realized my life ahead of me will be hard unless I pass. 

Positives: I met some people on 4tran4 that has had shared experiences. I finally got to express myself and be more of me, even if I’m downlow. My mom and dad accept me in some capacity. My medical bills are all paid for. I finally went to LGBTQ events. My Insurance has covered my gender affirming care. I started to realize that this stuff takes time. So while I wait, I can doom on 4tran and talk to you ❤️. I got fat so I’m hoping by loosing weight I’ll discover if I twink died or not. ",5,1759891340.0,4tran4,0,1.0,False

1o0yvqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1o0yvqy/i_need_some_tips_please/,I need some tips please,"Hey, a bit about me: I'm 35, I have clinical depression and have been taking medication for roughly the last year and I've been working backshift for the last 5. Recently, my sleep has severely declined to the point where I'm missing a lot of work because I'm dozing off on the way into work. I'm terrified my wife is going to wake up in the morning and either A) find me in a ditch or B) wake up to me in the hospital/dead. I've recently started sleeping pills (troloxodone or something,) and so far, no good. I'm supposed to take 1-3 a night, but the pharmacist said to start with half where I've never taken any sleep aids before. I've tried half, and I've tried a full pill. Neither did anything. Not even an extra half hour of sleep. I've reduced caffeine and energy drink intake. At one point I was drinking 3-5 coffees a day plus 2-3 energy drinks. Now I might drink 1-2 coffees a day and 1-2 energy drinks depending. Though, tbh, I haven't noticed much difference in anything since cutting back. 

Now, we have a lot going on at the house involving renovations, and she's pregnant finally after years of trying, so this could simply be stress induced. I don't feel stressed over either of those though. Tbh, the only thing I feel stressed about is my lack of sleep. I like to blame backshift and depression, but over the five years I've been working, it's never been *this* bad. I have had bad bouts of depression, but lack of sleep like this has never been an issue. 

I'm honestly at my wits end here and I don't know what to do. ShouldI keep increasing my dose of meds until I hit three pills or just say to hell with it and skip two? Skipping a pill and going to the max seems like a bad idea. I loathe the idea of taking sleeping pills because I'm terrified that if I hit a bad bout of depression I may try to OD. When I mentioned that to the Dr, they said this medicine does act as an antidepressant and should help in that regard too. 

I don't know if this is true insomnia or what, but any tips you guys could throw my way would be greatly appreciated.  ",1,1759891133.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

1o0ytu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1o0ytu0/102_大爆炸_big_bang/,10.2 大爆炸 Big Bang,"一天下午，我忽然感觉肚子疼，怀疑大佛印那帮人（敌对势力）要杀我灭口，指使我同事在我喝的咖啡里下毒。我去警察局报警，警察看着我说，都没记录，没什么反应。我离开了警察局，想去医院；可我知道在医院排队看病要等十几个小时，实在是难熬，就回家了。

我一直想我和刘团长之间的事，认为自从2004年，他就没再来逗我玩了。我串联起了整个第2章《桃花劫》的故事（注，但还没有回忆出第1至3章的事），认为自己想明白了 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字。我一直对佛教的不见顶智（即上帝之眼）着迷，没想到刘团长用在我身上了。我觉得自己是个畜生，他那么大岁数了，快病死了，三番两次托人捎信让我去看他，而我像个活驴一样，无动于衷；自作孽，不可活！

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe"" (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist “intelligence of not seeing the top” (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

**10.2-1 肠梗阻 Ileus**

忽然，我感觉五脏六腑都在移动，身体里到处都是邪气乱窜。我小时候练过气功（参见第12章），对这种肢体的触觉幻觉不感觉奇怪，但这邪气发动的规模之大，程度之剧烈，让我震惊。我赶忙躺到了床上，以免晕倒。

我感觉到胸下出现一个隔截面（如插图10.2.1-A），上下不通气，胃肠不走动（注，现代医学称为肠梗阻）。我立刻调整呼吸，驱动真气沿着任脉向下冲击那个中截面。真气一接触那道截面，截面就溃散了。很快，那些邪气又变形重组，堵在胸口处（约在膳中穴，俗称中丹田）。我继续调整呼吸，用真气沿着任脉向下冲击堵在心窝处沉重阴冷的邪气。几分钟后，我打通了任脉，身体和胃肠的蠕动恢复了正常。我镇静下来后，心想：一时悸动，还真没遇见过；可不能再胡思乱想了！

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and “ill air” were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child (see chapter 12), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the “ill air” shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove “True Air” down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the “True Air” touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the “Ill Air” reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

**10.2-2 大爆炸 Big Bang**

过了一会儿，我不介意刚才发生的事了，又开始自责：我可真不是个东西，这不是人干的事儿。突然，我又感觉全身都有异动，赶忙平躺在床上了，全身的肉都有轻微的凹凸跳动的现象。凹凸跳动的现象有些加剧了。从命门穴（后腰两肾处），各发射出一股电弧的感觉沿着体表皮肤，像似水纹一样扩散；两股电弧在前腹处相撞了。接着，全身都有大小多个电圈套着肢体和整个身体上下移动，像似在做CT检查扫描一样，但我在经历的是多个电圈上下移动扫描我的身体。两只胳臂和两条腿分别有多个小电圈在上下移动扫描。突然，全身各处涌起气伴随着电流，以比读秒快几倍的速度，向丹田（如插图10.2.1-B）汇集。聚集在丹田后，立刻就爆炸了。随着爆炸，那些碎片气扩散到了全身各处。

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

我高幸地想：哎呀！大爆炸，百脉震开！我小时候在气功书上看过这种现象的描写，会百脉皆开。可是，正在发生的事情和传说的不一样。几秒后，整个身躯，包括脸部的肉都有明显的凹凸式上下跳动的现象，像似沸腾了着的水面；我的全身各处都在沸腾和震动。我对自己说：“镇静！沉住气！别慌！” 全身凸凹跳动的现象持续了几秒后，渐渐地平息了。这时我在床上平躺着，关注着全身各处的异动。

散布在全身各处的气变得清凉，随着流动在数百处小范围内聚集，并伴有电流、阴冷、凸凹地跳动的病气（或邪气）的感觉。我意识到了这不是好现象！不是书里描写的舒服，凉爽。我感觉那些迷走性风湿气中几十股大的，不走经脉，而是径直地走向心脏，一边移动一边还在汇集。有几股迷走性风湿气移动得很快，比如说，厘米每秒。

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

我立刻紧张了，如果迷走性风湿气侵入心脏；心脏就是一团肌肉，若是这样怪异地颤抖，那不就是心肌梗塞吗！我小时候，听奶奶说过多次。她一次生气后，在外面树荫下睡着了。半梦半醒之间，她感觉像似有一股气流进了心脏。从那时起，她就患了心脏病。

保卫心脏，我立刻行动起来了，别的器官都管不了了。我开始用真气对离心脏近且移动速度快的迷走性风湿气进行攻击。好在，那些邪气流都很脆弱，一被真气碰到，就散了。很短的时间内，我就击溃了十几股迷走性风湿气流团。这时我发现，几股主要的风湿气移动得慢了，大部分风湿气不移动了。我镇静了下来。

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about these many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my “true air” to attack the “vagal rheumatic air” that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those “evil airs” were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my “true air”. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen “vagal rheumatic air” groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

**注10.2.2 Note 10.2.2**

插图10.2.1-2源自古墨西哥，表明古代的美洲有和中国类似的真气理论（即针灸和气功理论，参见第12章）。插图10.2.1-4是公元七世纪，帕卡尔王（Lord Pacal，亦作金童，特拉洛克，狮子王））的灵棺盖板，刻画了他堕入地狱的前因后果。图上部显示十字架或金刚剑插入了帕卡尔王的腹部，表示他被十字架钉住了，病危了。图底部他的狮子头正处于一个火匣子里，表示帕卡尔王堕入了 “火途” （即地狱，精神病）。火匣子上面是他的神父的棺材，表示帕卡尔王是被 “他神父过世” 的信息打入地狱的。棺材里是空的，只留下了尸体爆炸后遗留下来的三块儿残渣（即三块佛骨舍利，人骨），表明帕卡尔王听到他神父过世的消息后，体内发生了爆炸，所以他堕入了地狱，即患了精神病。棺材上面显示，一根射精的阴茎可以提起棺材，表示帕卡尔王和翠玉女（即玉女）的事实婚姻是治疗他的疾病的正确方法，可以使他脱离地狱。

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of “true air” (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or “philosopher-stone sword” inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka. Jade Girl) is the right way to cure his illness and save him from hell.

**10.2-3 我投降了 I surrendered.**

我对刘团长对我做过什么感到迷惑；但我和他的矛盾是我不同意他的 “我卢岩是刘健君的丈夫” 的决定（参见8.2节《死不瞑目》）。我真气已经很少了（注，聚集和运送真气需要大量的体力和时间），可这时的我全身都是风湿气。我已经处于面对死亡的状态，投降了。

我跪在床上发誓： “刘健君是我的妻子；刘团长是我岳父；我会去追求她并和她结婚。” 我不断地叨咕着： “刘健君她爸是我的岳父，刘健君是我的媳妇。” 我知道誓言对人的思想有很强的统摄作用。这样出声地叨咕，有助于我集中思想和精力，对不让松散意识抵触和破坏我的主意识，消除心理矛盾大有好处。

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" (cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""). I had very little “true air” left (note, gathering and transporting “true air” requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

我找出了我收藏的针灸经脉图。真气在经脉里会走得快，通畅和增强。我先在经脉图上筹划运气的路线，和打击风湿症的最短和最有力的角度，再运气发功对风湿症病处进行攻击。又击碎了几团风湿症后，我发现迷走性风湿症移动的速度变得更慢了。我沿着手少阴心经（如插图10.2.1-C）运气；用真气把心脏包裹了起来。这样，弱的迷走性风湿症不会有机会靠近心脏。

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The “true air” will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of “true air” flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used “true air” to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved “true air” along the “Shou Shao Yin heart sutra” (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with “true airs”. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

这时，我认为自己必须吃好睡好，保持健康，才能与全身的迷走性风湿症对抗。如果我的身体健康变差了，就可能什么时候患了风湿性心脏病，死不了也成了废人。我向妻子和孩子做了生死离别，没明说，她们也不懂。我害怕睡梦里自己不知道保护心脏，所以睡觉前，洗了热水澡来平衡全身的体温，以减少做梦。我躺在床上，调息收敛思想，然后熄灭了前意识，把心身的控制权交给了无意识（古作神识）（参考案例1.4.2《井阳之灾》）。佛经上说，这种状态，人的愈合力极强，等同神佛。

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense; reference case 1.4.2 Well-Sun Catastrophe). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

**注10.2.3 Note 10.2.3**

前面三小节描述的病症在现代的医学中称作皈依失调（Conversion Disorder；如图10.2.3-1所示），是一种罕见的精神疾病。在随后几年与风湿症对抗的过程中，我不断地研究，现在认为此病是这样产生的。我从小就敬畏刘团长，想拜他为师（是一种连自己都不清楚知道的向往），第8章中，遇到刘健君后，更是对刘团长有了深刻的爱恨情仇。随后，我和刘团长的爱恨情仇又持续发展了六年，但我没见过他，所以在我的幻境中他就是一团白色迷雾。那迷雾是现量（参见11.4.5 识蕴 Sense Node），代表刘团长，是我对刘团长全部感情的和记忆的依附标的物。当我意识到他已经过世了，这信息被我的无意识（古作神识）接收到后，那团迷雾就消失了，因为无意识只处理现量，而刘团长不再是现量了。这样，我对刘团长的全部感情和记忆就失去了所依附的标的物，就引起了大混乱，产生了前文的“皈依失调症”。

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don’t even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my “Gratitude Resentment Love and Hatred” relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the “Present Quantity” (see 11.4.5 Sense Node), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes “Present Quantity”, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the “Present Quantity”. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

前面三小节描述的病症是癔症（古作鬼病）中的一种极端现象，称作圣鬼。插图10.2.3-2源自古墨西哥，是一位堕入地狱期间的特拉洛克（即金童）。雕像顶部是古墨西哥人对圣鬼的表述。雕像的正面，圣鬼正用许多代表迷走性风湿症的阴茎攻击特拉洛克。阴茎代表产生特拉洛克体内迷走性风湿症的原因是他和翠玉女（即玉女）的婚姻纠纷。插图10.2.3-3是佛教中的金刚降魔杵；其中（4）（8）（9）的顶端部是代表圣鬼的雕塑。圣鬼的本质是惭愧；面对刘团长，我总是惭愧，是罪人。

前面三小节描述 “死不瞑目”诅咒在我身上爆发的现象。后来我发现那和西方人所说的 “三个不可饶恕的诅咒” 的意义相同，知道了西方人所说的三个不可饶恕诅咒， “立毙咒，钻心咒，和夺魂咒” 正是对死不瞑目诅咒所产生的现象的描述。

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the “Philosopher-Stone Pestle” in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus”, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the “Die with Eyes Open”.

**10.1 刘团长的死讯 News of Liu’s Death**

二零一一年五月，我到高德联合公司（Golder Associates Inc.）的实验室工作。高德是家上市了的国际性岩土工程公司。我只在实验室里工作，不下工地，接触的人少。实验室的经理玛丽的名字很长，我不能拼读。在面试我时，她同意我称呼她玛丽（Mary）。她来自一个我不知道在哪里的国家。她再次解释；我还是想不出来，就不好意思再问了。工作一段时间后，我发现人们称呼她玛丽亚、罗密欧什么的，再次问应该怎么称呼她。她回答她的生活里就这样，不同的人叫她不同的名字，习惯了。我常观察她，她是个标准健壮的欧洲血统白人，行为端庄得体，传统西方人的世界观，性格不紧不慢，没有地方口音，没有民族和地域的特质；我分析不出她来自何方。

开始的两个月还好，可工作中，我又接触到了达弗罗克（Davroc）和大佛印（Dufferin）公司的人和业务，渐渐的我的觉思失调症又成长起来了。我和同事之间有了矛盾，对黑社会的担心越来越重。刘健君研究灵魂转世，雇佣黑社会的人，黑社会的人办事不成，丢了面子，或者什么人矜持不住了，就可能出现谋杀事件。

In May 2011, I went to work in the laboratory of Golder Associates Inc. Golder is a publicly traded international geotechnical engineering firm. I only worked in the lab, not went to the job site, had little contact with people. The lab manager, Mary, had a long name that I couldn't spell. When I was interviewed, she agreed to let me call her Mary. She was from a country I didn't know where. She explained again; I still couldn't figure it out, so I was too embarrassed to ask again. After working for a while, I realized that people called her Maria, Mario, or whatever, and again asked what I should call her. She replied that that was how it was in her life; different people called her different names and got used to it. I often observe her. She is a standard, strong white woman of European descent. She behaves in a dignified and proper manner, has a traditional Western worldview, a leisurely personality, no local accent, and no ethnic or regional characteristics. I cannot analyze where she is from.

The first two months were fine, but at work, I met people and business from Davroc and Dufferin, and gradually my schizophrenia worsened. I had conflicts with my colleagues, and I became more and more worried about the black society. Eve Liu studied soul reincarnation and hired black society people. If those mafias failed to get tasks done, lost face, or someone lost their composure, there might be murders.

**10.1-2**

一天的喝咖啡休息时间，听同事们在唠嗑。事后，不知为什么，我回忆起了玛丽讲她开会时看的录像。刘健君回答桫椤派去调查我的人：“卢岩心理的社会环境和别人不一样。他念研究生的时候，他同屋那个人是我爸爸安排的。他们就一起骗他；他就信了。”

调查的人问：“现在你爸爸在哪儿？”

刘健君回答：“死了！我爸爸做的事儿与我没有关系。那时我不在国内，我在美国读博士呢！”

调查的人问：“那你为什么不告诉卢岩？”

One day during a coffee break, I listened to my colleagues chatting. Afterwards, for some reason, I recalled Mary's talk about the video she watched in the meeting. Eve Liu answered the person sent by Sal Fasullo to investigate me: ""Luyan's psychological social environment is different from others. When he was a graduate student, the person he shared a room with was arranged by my father. They lied to him together; he believed it.""

The investigator asked, ""Where is your father now?""

Eve Liu replied, ""Dead! What my father did has nothing to do with me. I was not in China at that time, I was in the United States studying for my doctorate!""

The investigator asked, ""Then why didn't you tell Luyan?""

刘健君回答：“我爸说，卢岩很犟。他不亲眼看见，谁告诉他，他都不信，就只能是别人在他旁边唠嗑，或者路上的人唠嗑，他听见了，就想。一点儿点儿地，他想明白了，就没事儿了。”

调查的人问：“你爸爸想让卢岩干什么？”

刘健君回答：“他说我这辈子命运中没有丈夫，除了卢岩，别人都不行。说我不是他的女儿，卢岩是他的儿子。他就想让我和卢岩结婚。我爸说，看不见我和卢岩结婚，他死不瞑目。你看，我不迷信，不信这个。”

Eve Liu replied, ""My dad said that Luyan was very stubborn. If he didn't see it with his own eyes, he wouldn't believe anyone who told him, so he could only think about it when others chattered next to him or people on the road chattered, and he heard it. Little by little, he figured it out, and then he was fine.""

The investigator asked, ""What did your father want Luyan to do?""

Eve Liu replied, ""He said that I had no husband in my life, and that no one else would do except Luyan. He said that I am not his daughter and Luyan is his son. He then wanted me to marry Luyan. My dad said he can't see me marry Luyan, he dies with eyes open. You see! I am not superstitious and don't believe in this.""

我回忆起来玛丽亚所说的话之后，感觉奇怪：如果这是我以前想过的事，想象与现实混淆了，那不应该有我根本不知道的事。我回忆起了本书第2章中《桃花劫》的故事，是我妈妈给我讲的。她不记得 “前世姻缘，命中注定” 这八个字了。那玛丽亚说的这八个字是从哪里来的（注2）！？而且玛丽说的是英语，她的用词和我英语用词的习惯根本不一样。我回忆、分析刘团长已经五、六年没对我做过什么了，认为他真的已经过世了。

我认为刘团长真的早就过世了，心情很不好，两三天里像似病了一样。我怀疑刘健君收买了我的妻子，并委托人照顾我的孩子，我总发现他们在变化。

注10.1-2，环境形成后，相关的语言就会出现。在前文第2章，我两岁时听这样的词当然不理解，记忆也很少，但这时有了相关的环境，这词就冒出来了。

After I recalled what Marry said, felt strange: If this was something I had thought about before, and imagination was confused with reality, then there shouldn't be something I didn't know. I recalled the story of ""Peach Flower Catastrophe"" in Chapter 2 of this book, which my mother told me. She didn't remember the eight words “Former Generation’s Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate”. So where did Mary's eight words come from (Note 2)!? And Mary spoke English; her word usage was completely different from my English verbal habits. I recalled and analyzed that Troupe Leader Liu had not done anything to me for five or six years, thought he was dead.

I thought that Troupe Leader Liu had really passed away a long time ago. I was in a very bad mood and seemed to be sick for two or three days. I suspected that Eve Liu bribed my wife and entrusted someone to take care of my children. I always found that they were changing.

Note 10.1-2, after the environment is formed, the related language will appear. In the previous chapter 2, when I was two years old, I didn’t understand such words and I had very little memory, but now there is a related environment, so the words pop up.

1o0ysnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/1o0ysnv/founding_the_boston_nofitness_democratic/,Founding the Boston No-Fitness Democratic Dictatorship,"# We Will Walk Slowly and Rule Kindly

Hello, comrades and couch potatoes of the Greater Boston Area.

I am forming the **Boston No-Fitness Democratic Dictatorship**, a social collective for people who:

* Have been meaning to start exercising since 2017 but keep “waiting for the right vibe”
* Believe a brisk walk counts as cardio *if you were emotionally invested in the conversation*
* Want community, mild snacks, and zero expectations

This is not a joke (but also it’s mostly a joke).

# Our Core Tenets

1. **No fitness.** We will meet in places that *discourage* movement — think dimly lit bars, public libraries, MBTA platforms where the train is always “2 stops away.”
2. **Democratic dictatorship.** Everyone has a voice. But I have the final say. Unless someone brings really good baked goods, in which case we can discuss a peaceful coup.
3. **Vibes-based governance.** Decisions are made via “vibe consensus,” not voting. If it feels wrong, we don’t do it. If it feels funny, we probably do it twice.
4. **Boston-based loyalty.** You don’t have to *like* Boston, but you do have to *complain* about it frequently.
5. **Dress code:** layers. Always too many layers.

# Membership Perks

* Occasional access to communal snacks (chips, Trader Joe’s frozen apps, lukewarm coffee)
* Emotional support during mild inconveniences (waiting for the 57, running out of oat milk)
* Zero judgment if you say “we should totally hike sometime” and never follow up

# First Gathering

TBD. Probably somewhere with chairs. Maybe in the Public Garden, but only if it’s overcast and 63°F.

Comment if you want to be part of the **founding council** (which will immediately dissolve due to indecision).

Very few movies actually get the second part right and of course, that’s subjective.

**Biggest surprise?** The *visual effects*! I genuinely didn’t expect animation to blend this seamlessly into live action. ಹ್ಯಾಟ್ಸ್ ಆಫ್, whoever pulled that off you deserve a lifetime supply of filter coffee, mosaranna and applause! ☕👏

**Music:** Good, solid, never overdid it. But if I compare, Part 1 was still a notch higher. Still, kudos to the team not boring us in a long movie is an achievement by itself!

**Sets, costumes, camerawork:** Excellent. Technically, this movie is like that one student who gets full marks in lab but just misses theory by a few marks.

**Casting and acting:** Here’s where things get a bit tricky. There were too many characters, and some of them felt misplaced. I really like *Rukmini Vasanth*, but somehow I kept seeing *Priya from Sapta* more than *Kanakavathi*. Maybe that’s my bias showing 😅. Also, *Achyuth Kumar* was completely underused, and Rishab’s side characters weren’t as strong this time, especially after how high the bar was set in Part 1.

**Story:** Hmm… this one almost follows the trailer. Apart from one big twist, there wasn’t much to hold on to. Part 1 kept you guessing and flowing; this one, not so much. It’s like watching a train that starts well but keeps stopping at every unnecessary station 🚉.

**Fillers:** Too many! At one point, I was like, “Wait, how much backstory and explanation do we need to understand the movie?” The backstory overload made it a bit tiring.

**Humour:** Forced in places. Some jokes actually diluted good scenes instead of elevating them. ನಗ್ಬೇಕು ಅನ್ಸತ್ತೆ, but scene spoil ಆಗತ್ತೆ.

And unlike the first part, there wasn’t any big *“aha!”* message that stays with you afterward.

**Verdict:** A solid *3 out of 5*. Rishab Shetty still deserves credit for taking risks and pushing boundaries. I just hope he doesn’t get pulled too deep into the *commercial* ocean 🌊.  
Also, huge respect to *Raj B Shetty* for deciding not to make a Part 2 of *Su from So.* sometimes, knowing where to stop *is* genius. 🙏",1,1759890584.0,ChitraLoka,1,0.55,False

1o0ylww,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1o0ylww/my_best_friends_boyfriend_refuses_to_meet_me_or/,My best friend’s boyfriend refuses to meet me or my husband and I’m struggling not to take it personally. Am I overreacting?,"My (30F) best friend (29F) has been dating her boyfriend for just under a year. From everything she’s told me, he’s great, kind, funny, good to her, close with her family. She’s genuinely happy and I love that for her. But I’ve never met him. Not once. Not even a “hey” in the background when she’s at his place and we’re on the phone.

For context, I’m married with four kids (12M, 9M, almost 4M, and 1.5F) and four dogs (medium to large). It’s a full house, but we’ve invited her to do adult-only things like coffee, dinner, backyard hangouts with the kids at grandma’s, etc. My husband’s a friendly Italian cook who lives to feed people, and I’m an introvert who can turn on my social side when needed (thanks former sales career). We’re not loud or overbearing, just… busy.

Her boyfriend has social anxiety and is in treatment, which I completely respect. I also have anxiety and am on a mini pharmacy of anxiety meds, so I understand how hard it can be. I’ve wanted to meet him someday because he makes my friend so happy, but I’ve tried not to push. I’d love to throw her a quiet birthday party or something without her feeling like she has multiple places to be. 

She and he agreed that he can meet people at his own pace as long as he keeps working on it, and I totally respect that. But last weekend, he had lunch with her other best friend — and while I’m genuinely happy for them, it stung a little. Especially because he’s told her he doesn’t care if he ever meets me or my husband, and that “we sound like a lot.”

That comment really hurt. I love my friend and want her to be able to bring him around without stress, maybe to a BBQ or a hangout, but right now it feels like we’re the only ones in her life he’s written off completely.

To add to that, my friend also has a daughter who hasn’t been introduced to her BF as a BF just yet. Since they got more serious, we don’t hang out much outside of her nannying for my little kids (1.5 and almost 4) while I work from home. That started because my daughter was injured at daycare last year and it was bad enough to involve insurance and lawyers. We aren’t comfortable returning them to daycare and in trying to work out what to do, she offered to nanny for them as she was unhappy in her other work. We’ve all agreed if it ever stops working for anyone that’s a-okay, but in the mean time we pay her more than she asked for. Anyhow, while we see each other all the time, it’s not friend time — it’s her working and me working while we chat here and there. And when she has free time without her daughter, she usually spends it with him, which I understand. I don’t really ask her to hang out much because she’s said how limited their time together is and how it bothers her, and I don’t want to add to her stress.

I’m just sad. I miss her. I wish I could meet the person who’s become such a big part of her life. And while I know this isn’t about me, it’s hard not to feel left out. ",1,1759890318.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I am freaking out.,"I woke up and I immediately freaked out. The one thing I was not able to do for sure is read in dreams and I did it(ofc there are exceptions). How is that possible scientifically?

I am supposed to go to doctors with my husband today and so that was the dream about. My husband and I were waiting at the hospital lobby. We went to the reception and gave our names and the lady said that we will have to wait as she is making the records as book(whatever that means lol). We were waiting in the lobby and she gave us a book. It actually looked like a coffee table magazine or whatever. So I opened and there were photos of mine and my husband's. Passport sized photos. And then there were names and stuff I hope ofc I couldn't read and I don't remember either. I kept turning the pages over and every page has some medical record like ECG, scanner etc. 

Then came a page, which I still remember clearly.. in that page there was a table.. and each row and column has some words in one column and + - symbol in the other column. So most of the words are messy. I was not able to read. Ofcourse. Some of the words in the table are ringworm and tapeworm which I read. And below the table there is a mention of + means positive and - means negative. And I was able to read that too and I still remember it. 

And then I was like ""omg we have worms"" and I woke up. I woke up in the middle of the night and to pee and I realized I just read in the dream and I freaked out. 

What could be the reason? How is that scientifically possible? 

I lucid dream, I get recurring dreams in which I change the events remembering the previous occurance, I get this dream continuity after many days.. everytime such dreams happened I had freaked out but now I'm used to it and atleast it can have some explanations. But reading? How is that possible when your reading function won't work while sleeping?  What are all the exceptions?

P.S I wasn't lucid dreaming today. 


Edit: Its not a myth guys. Scientifically your brian functions responsible to read is inactive while sleeping. And you can visualise words in some cases. Reading and rereading new words and discussing about it in your dream is what happened to me.  I am looking for a scientific explanation. I am wondering what kind of sleep disorders can make one read? Or let me put it this way,  what kind of sleep disorders will keep the brain active while sleeping?

Like for example.. positive negative words in my dream make sense. I might have visualized it from my memory of looking at reports. Ringworm tapeworm is not from my recent memory at least. So I'm just wondering.",1,1759889924.0,Dreams,16,0.6,False

Rent was overdue, the eviction notice was taped to my door like a scarlet letter, and my fridge held nothing but half a bottle of ketchup and a takeout container I was too afraid to open. I’d stopped answering calls weeks ago, there were only so many ways to say “I’ll pay you next Friday” when Friday had stopped showing up for you.

Every night I sat in front of my laptop until my eyes burned, scrolling through job sites that blurred together into one long rejection letter. Experience required. Degree preferred. Must be willing to smile while dying inside.

No one hires someone whose only résumé entry is “desperate.”

That’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t even online. I was walking home from the grocery store, empty-handed because even ramen felt like a luxury, and I noticed a flyer taped to the bus stop shelter. It was printed on plain white paper, the kind you’d pull from a dusty office printer.

Black letters. No logo. No company name.

SELL YOUR TIME.

Competitive rates. No experience necessary.

I laughed. Out loud, to no one.

A scam, obviously. Some shady gig that ends with your kidneys on the dark web. But the thing stuck in my head the entire walk home, like an earworm. Sell your time. The words were too simple, too confident, like whoever wrote them didn’t care if you believed or not.

By the time I reached my apartment, curiosity had started wrestling with hopelessness. What if it wasn’t a scam? What if it was just weird? Weird was better than starving.

The email was printed in tiny letters at the bottom of the page. I typed it in, hit send, and told myself it was just a joke.

They replied before I even finished making coffee.

The message was short.

Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp.

Orientation available tomorrow, 9:00 AM. No documentation required.

Please arrive on time.

No address signature, no phone number. Just a street name I’d never heard of and those last two words — on time.

The next morning, I went. I don’t even remember deciding to. I just remember standing in front of a building that looked too clean to exist in my part of town.

ChronoCorp.

The name was printed in thin silver letters above the glass doors. No slogan, no logo. Inside, the air smelled like nothing, the sterile, filtered kind of nothing that only money can afford. Everything gleamed white: the floors, the walls, even the furniture. The only color came from the clocks.

There were so many clocks.

Dozens of them lined the walls, each one a little different, antique brass, digital displays, wristwatches in glass cases, but all ticking in perfect, synchronized rhythm. Not a single second out of place.

The sound was hypnotic. Soft but endless.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

The receptionist sat behind a white counter that looked like it had never known dust. Her hair was neatly pinned back, her uniform spotless, her expression... off. Like a smile worn thin from too much practice.

“Thank you for your interest in ChronoCorp,” she said, every syllable smooth and balanced. “We value every second.”

I told her I didn’t have a résumé. She didn’t blink.

“We won’t need that.”

She slid a clipboard toward me. The paper was thick and heavy, the kind you’d use for wedding invitations.

It wasn’t a job application. There was no section for previous employment or emergency contact. Just a handful of lines filled with legal jargon that might as well have been written in another language.

The only part in bold, centered in the middle of the page, read:

TIME EXCHANGED.

There was a line for a signature underneath.

I hesitated, glancing up to ask a question, but the receptionist wasn’t looking at me anymore.

Her gaze was fixed on the largest clock on the wall, a massive black-and-gold thing that ticked with mechanical precision.

For a moment, I thought the sound of it got louder. Like the air itself was keeping time.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

“Do I need to…?” I started, but she cut me off gently.

“Just sign, and we’ll take care of the rest.”

Her tone was kind. Too kind. Like someone comforting a child before a vaccination.

My stomach twisted, but the word “paycheck” echoed in my head louder than the ticking.

I signed.

She smiled, not warmly, but with a kind of satisfaction that made my chest tighten. Then she reached for a small silver stopwatch on the counter, pressed it once, and said softly:

“Your time begins now.”

The ticking in the room seemed to falter for a single beat.

Just one.

Then everything went perfectly, eerily back to rhythm.

The job turned out to be… easy.

Too easy.

A man in a gray suit met me in the lobby the next morning. He didn’t smile, didn’t introduce himself, just turned on his heel and motioned for me to follow. His shoes made no sound on the tile. Mine did. That was the first thing that felt wrong: it was like the building only chose to echo for me.

The hallways stretched longer than they should have. Clean. Too clean. White walls, chrome trim, soft white lights that never flickered, and clocks, everywhere. Wall clocks, desk clocks, floor clocks, all ticking together in a perfect synchronized rhythm. The sound should have been comforting, but it wasn’t. It reminded me of breathing—one, two, three—and I couldn’t tell if it was mine or the building’s.

We passed door after door, each labeled Donation Room followed by a number. I tried to count them, but somewhere between 6 and 9, I lost track. The numbers didn’t make sense. We turned corners that didn’t seem to exist in the building’s floor plan I’d seen online.

Finally, he stopped at Donation Room 7. The door opened with a soft click, and he motioned me inside.

The room was small, barely big enough for the chair in the center and the machine beside it. The machine looked old, older than the building itself. Heavy brass panels, faint scratches on its surface, the kind of hum you feel more than hear. Wires coiled out from its sides like veins, ending in silver discs the size of coins. A dial on the front read:

Hours Donated: 0.00.

“Please sit,” the man said. His voice was quiet, smooth, practiced.

I obeyed, mostly out of habit, out of hunger.

The discs against my temples were cold enough to make me flinch. The metal smelled faintly like ozone, like lightning before a storm.

“You may feel a brief acceleration,” he said. “That’s normal.”

Acceleration. I opened my mouth to ask what that meant, but before I could speak, the hum deepened. It wasn’t loud, more like a pressure behind my eyes. My heartbeat started matching it. Or maybe it was the other way around.

Then it stopped.

The man was already removing the discs. His movements were calm, deliberate, unbothered.

The wall clock said an hour had passed. My phone said the same. But I hadn’t felt it. Not a second of it. My body felt rested, lighter, like I’d been asleep but better. My hunger was gone, replaced by this strange clarity—like my brain had been polished.

The man handed me a slip of paper. $480.

“Payment is automatic,” he said. “You’ll receive it instantly.”

He was right. By the time I checked my phone, the deposit was already there. No delay, no pending transaction. Just, done.

The second session went the same. So did the third.

Each visit, I’d sit, feel the hum, blink, and time would vanish. No dizziness. No side effects. Just missing hours and a bigger balance in my account.

Other employees drifted through the hallways like ghosts in pressed uniforms. They didn’t talk much. They didn’t look much either. Sometimes I’d pass someone I swore I’d seen before, only their face would seem slightly off. Not in a big way, just subtly rearranged, like they were the same person but through a fogged mirror.

Once, I stopped by the vending machine on my way out and saw a woman staring at it, hand hovering over the keypad, motionless. Her reflection in the metal looked sharper than her actual face.

“What does it do?” I asked, nodding toward her door.

She blinked slowly, then smiled without looking up. “Don’t overthink it,” she said. “Just enjoy the paychecks.”

And I did.

The money felt unreal at first, too much, too easy, but after a few sessions, I stopped questioning it. Bills disappeared. The fridge filled up. I bought a new mattress, decent headphones, even a proper coat for the first time in years. I slept through the night without the usual dread gnawing at me.

For a while, it felt like maybe this was what stability looked like.

But little things started bothering me.

The clocks, for one. They ticked in perfect unison, at work, at home, even on my phone. I’d lie in bed sometimes and hear it under the silence, soft, steady, everywhere.

And the seconds. They’d skip.

Not randomly, but rhythmically, like something was cutting out the empty space between ticks. Sometimes my phone would jump from 10:42:06 to 10:42:08, cleanly, like the world had blinked and moved on without me.

I told myself it was nothing. Just a glitch.

But some mornings I’d wake up and my phone’s alarm would already be ringing, even though I hadn’t set it. I’d check the call log and see a number labeled “ChronoCorp HQ,” listed at times I didn’t remember being awake.

And every night, just before I drifted off, I’d feel that faint hum behind my temples again.

It wasn’t loud enough to scare me.

Just loud enough to remind me it was still there.

Counting.

The first thing I lost was a meal.

Nothing major. Just dinner.

I came home one night, dropped my keys on the counter, and saw an empty plate in the sink. Grease streaks. Crumbs. A fork balanced across it. Only, I hadn’t cooked. I hadn’t eaten.

I stood there staring at the plate longer than I care to admit, waiting for some memory to click into place. It didn’t. The smell of garlic still lingered in the air, faint but fresh.

I checked my phone.

A text from my friend Mia: “That pasta was good. You should cook more often.”

My thumb hovered over the screen. I hadn’t seen her in weeks.

I started to type back, something like What pasta?, but before I finished, the typing bubbles appeared on her end. Then froze. Then disappeared. The timestamp on her message read “Yesterday.”

I stared at that word until the phone went dark.

After that, it wasn’t just dinner.

I’d open my fridge and find groceries I didn’t remember buying, fresh fruit, cold cuts, a bottle of wine that definitely hadn’t been there the day before. Once I found a grocery receipt in my jacket pocket, signed in my handwriting, with a timestamp for 2:13 a.m.

Sometimes I’d wake up and my laundry was folded neatly in the basket. Once, my sheets were changed. I don’t even own spare sheets.

For a while, I blamed stress. Or maybe the sessions at ChronoCorp were messing with my sleep schedule. Maybe “donating hours” confused my body clock. It was the only explanation that didn’t make me sound insane.

But it wasn’t just me.

One morning, the clocks in my apartment stopped. Every single one, digital, analog, wall, phone, for exactly one second.

Then, without a sound, they all caught up in perfect unison.

I stood there holding my breath, listening to the faint tick that seemed to crawl under everything. The fridge hum, the traffic outside, even my heartbeat, everything was syncing to that rhythm.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

It wasn’t loud. It didn’t need to be. It was constant.

Then came the bruises.

Small, circular ones on my arms and neck. Not painful, just there. The size of a coin. I tried to remember bumping into something, but the harder I tried, the more my memories slipped away like water between fingers.

Some mornings, there’d be new marks. Faint scratches along my ribs. Little red indentations on my temples where the discs used to sit.

At work, no one mentioned them. The man in the gray suit still met me in the lobby, still walked me wordlessly to Donation Room 7.

Same chair. Same hum. Same slip of paper with a new number.

Only the machine was different this time.

The dial didn’t start at zero.

It already read 3.00 when I sat down.

I frowned. “Why does it say that?”

The man’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes seemed… distant, like he was reading off a script written behind my head.

“It accounts for carryover,” he said.

“Carryover of what?”

He smiled. It was the kind of smile people practice in mirrors, all muscle, no meaning.

“Time isn’t lost,” he said softly. “It’s redistributed.”

Before I could respond, the hum began.

This time, I felt it deeper. Not in my head, in my bones. The air thickened. My vision tunneled.

When it stopped, I didn’t feel lighter.

I felt stretched.

Like part of me hadn’t caught up yet. Like I’d stood up too fast and left something behind.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The hum seemed to follow me home, whispering in the stillness. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw numbers flickering behind my eyelids—3.00, 4.25, 6.00—like my dreams were clocking in.

The next morning, Mia called me.

I almost didn’t answer. When I finally did, her voice was trembling.

“Hey,” she said. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Why?”

“You don’t remember, do you?”

“Remember what?”

Silence. Long, unsteady. Then:

“You were at my place last night. You brought wine. You told me you quit your job.”

My chest went tight. “No, I didn’t.”

Her breath hitched. “You did. You were different. You looked… happy. But your eyes…”

“What about them?”

Another pause. Then, quietly:

“They weren’t yours.”

I didn’t know what to say. I think I hung up without meaning to.

That night, I didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. The hum was louder now, steady, pulsing behind my eyes like a second heartbeat. The clocks in my room ticked out of sync for the first time since I’d started at ChronoCorp.

Then, one by one, they corrected themselves.

Except my wristwatch.

It was still ticking a second too fast.

When I tried to reset it, the second hand pushed back.

Not jammed. Not broken.

Pushing back.

Like something inside was fighting to keep going.

I stopped going in for a week.

No calls. No emails. No one from ChronoCorp showed up at my door.

At first, I thought maybe they’d forgotten about me. Then the direct deposits kept coming.

Every Friday. Same time. Same amount.

Even though I hadn’t clocked in.

That’s what broke me.

It wasn’t guilt. It was curiosity.

If they didn’t need me to show up, then where the hell was my time coming from?

I decided to go back, not to work, but to find out who was signing my life away.

ChronoCorp’s lobby looked different that morning.

Brighter somehow. Polished. The walls gleamed with that false, hospital-white sheen that only fluorescent light can make. The air was sterile, humming softly with the sound of electricity, or maybe time itself.

And the clocks.

They were everywhere.

But this time, every single one showed the same thing: 12:00.

Hundreds of them, ticking in unison, yet somehow perfectly silent.

The receptionist smiled when she saw me.

“Mr. Hale,” she said, her voice syrup-smooth.

I froze.

“My name isn’t—”

She tilted her head, still smiling.

“It will be.”

She slid a visitor badge across the desk. I looked down.

It didn’t say Visitor.

It said:

DONOR 27 — EXPIRED ACCESS.

Something inside me twisted.

I didn’t correct her. I just took the badge and walked past before she could stop me.

The hallways were quieter than usual, but I could feel movement through the walls—machines breathing, wires pulsing. The floors vibrated faintly under my shoes, like the building had a heartbeat.

I passed room after room, glass walls revealing rows of people slumped in the same reclining chairs I’d used. Discs on their temples. The machines beside them pulsed with faint blue light.

Most were motionless. Some twitched.

Their eyes fluttered beneath closed lids, as if they were dreaming someone else’s dream.

I reached the end of the corridor.

A locked glass door read:

CLIENT ACCESS — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.

I swiped my badge, just to try.

The lock clicked open.

Inside was colder. The temperature dropped a few degrees instantly, and my breath fogged the glass.

Rows of monitors filled the room—hundreds of screens showing live feeds of people. All ordinary moments: a man eating dinner, a woman brushing her hair, a child playing with a dog. All of them… happy.

None of them noticed the cameras.

Then one screen caught my eye.

The feed showed me.

I was in a restaurant I didn’t recognize, wearing a suit I didn’t own, drinking wine I couldn’t afford. Across from me sat a woman, older, elegant, poised in a way money teaches. She was smiling, calm, as if she’d known me forever.

A label flashed at the corner of the feed:

CLIENT: ADELA HALE

PURCHASED HOURS: 268.

268 hours.

Eleven days.

That’s how much of me she owned.

I clicked into the file.

Notes appeared:

Excellent physical compatibility. Responsive body control. Requests recurring sessions.

Remaining balance: 2 years, 11 months, 4 days.

My mouth went dry.

I hadn’t sold that much.

“ You’re not supposed to be here.”

The voice came from behind me.

The man in the gray suit. Same one from the first day. Only now, his face looked thinner—like someone had scraped the human off him and left something hollow underneath.

“She likes your body,” he said, calm as ever. “Says it’s easy to move in.”

I turned on him. “I didn’t agree to this.”

He shrugged, almost kindly. “You signed the contract. You didn’t specify the limit. That’s what happens when you sell time in bulk.”

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Then I want it back.”

He tilted his head, watching me the way a clock might watch a second hand.

“You can’t take back what’s already spent.”

My hands shook. I grabbed the monitor, yanking it sideways. “Where is she?”

He looked up, eyes flicking toward the clock above the door.

“Not here,” he said. “She’s in there.”

The clock read 12:00.

It didn’t move.

Then something cracked inside my skull, like the sound of glass shattering underwater.

The air folded inward.

I was standing in the restaurant.

Same table. Same wine.

Adela Hale sat across from me, smiling my own smile.

“Hello, darling,” she said.

And it was my voice.

I stumbled back. “Get out of me.”

She chuckled softly. “You gave me this. You didn’t want the time. I simply made better use of it.”

The restaurant froze mid-motion, waiters paused mid-step, wine mid-pour, laughter suspended in the air like a photo.

The light flickered, but it wasn’t dimming. It was hesitating.

When I looked down, my hands weren’t syncing.

One lagged behind the other, like my body couldn’t decide what second it belonged to.

She stood, lifting her glass with perfect grace.

“You shouldn’t have come back,” she said. “You’re making a mess of the schedule.”

The walls bent inward. The air shimmered, bending sound and shape together.

I could hear the hum again, the same low vibration from the Donation Room, only now it filled every inch of me. My bones vibrated with it.

“Stop,” I whispered.

She smiled wider. “It’s already stopped.”

And she was right.

Everything was motionless except her, and me.

Then I realized she wasn’t really moving either.

She was replaying seconds ahead of me, like I was watching her future through a glass wall I couldn’t reach.

“Time,” she whispered, her voice overlapping itself like echoes in a tunnel,

“doesn’t belong to anyone. It just waits for someone desperate enough to sell it.”

I blinked, and she was gone.

So was the restaurant.

I was back in Donation Room 7.

Empty chair. Cold air. The hum fading into silence.

Only the clock on the wall remained.

Still ticking—one second too fast.

I reached for it, desperate to stop the sound, to prove I still existed.

My hand passed straight through.

The hum cut out.

Everything stopped.

For a heartbeat, I thought that was peace.

Then I realized it wasn’t silence.

It was the sound of something waiting to start again.

I woke up to the hum again.

Familiar, but distant.

Not my own heartbeat this time, it was someone else’s, pulsing inside me in a rhythm I couldn’t claim.

The chair beneath me was cold. Donation Room 7. Same walls. Same ceiling. Same hum trembling faintly through the air like a held breath, like the room itself was waiting for me to remember.

A slip of paper lay on the counter.

My handwriting. Only the number was different.

$1,200.

I didn’t remember doing it.

The receptionist smiled when I stumbled out. Perfect. Practiced. Empty, like her face was drawn onto glass.

“Thank you for your service,” she said.

“I… I don’t—”

My voice cracked. The words felt foreign, like I was trying to speak through static, like someone else was borrowing my mouth to answer for me.

Her eyes flicked toward the clock above the door. It wasn’t ticking. Or maybe it was, but the seconds weren’t mine anymore.

“Your time begins now,” she whispered.

I turned toward the mirror.

It wasn’t me.

Not entirely.

The face staring back belonged to someone else, wearing my eyes like borrowed glass. My hair, my skin, my hands… but hollow. A mask I had worn for someone else’s comfort. Its smile twitched half a beat too late.

The hum grew louder. Not just the machine. The walls. The air. The space between my ribs. Every breath vibrated like it was running on borrowed seconds. Every heartbeat felt leased, out of sync with my chest.

I tried to speak. My mouth moved. The words weren’t mine.

I tried to move. My body responded halfway, awkwardly, uncertainly. A marionette with tangled strings, limbs jerking just off‑time.

Then the screen in front of me flickered on.

Another me appeared, sitting in an office I didn’t recognize, smiling at a client I didn’t know.

Hours I’d never lived. Memories I’d never made.

Playing back in real time like a recording, except the recording was my body.

In one feed I was laughing; in another I was crying. In one I was holding a child. In another, a knife.

All of it me.

None of it mine.

I realized with a sick clarity:

I wasn’t gone. Not yet. But I was someone else’s property now.

The receptionist reached for the stopwatch.

Pressed it once.

“Your hour has been sold,” she said softly. “Enjoy the rest of your life… if you can call it that.”

The world wavered.

The hum became a single, stretched note that filled everything.

Every second I’d counted as mine slipped through my fingers like sand, leaving only the rhythm of something still ticking, somewhere far away.

I tried to scream. The sound that came out was mine—and yet not.

I tried to remember who I was. Nothing. Just a lingering echo of borrowed time.

Then nothing.

No pain. No sound. Just a faint, eternal ticking, waiting for the next desperate soul.

I thought: Maybe this is what eternity feels like.

And then, I was gone.",2,1759889814.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Most of us can agree that dating apps absolutely suck, and they’re just a money grab. Most of us can also agree that we may have had some kind of Reddit luck. Not winning the Powerball drawing kind of luck, but enough luck that you can connect with a cool human being. 

I’m a divorced dad of one , 50/50 custody with absolutely zero drama. We may have had our issues while married, but being  great co parents is something that adults do. I work from home, a big baseball fan, music lover, dirt bikes, the beach is very peaceful, love cooking/trying new recipes(food testers are welcome) and coffee is needed to survive. I’m 5’9, whitexican, brown hair, brown eyes, average build. Lastly, I’m totally rocking one killer dimple! My bones crack, my lower back hurts, I have bags under my eyes thank can carry groceries, but dammit I’m in my prime!

I’m looking for someone US based, with availability, and isn’t afraid to form a connection. Phone calls and video chats are also a must. How can you get to know someone just by texting? I’m a talker so I definitely vibe with someone who can also be a chatty Kathy. Lol
