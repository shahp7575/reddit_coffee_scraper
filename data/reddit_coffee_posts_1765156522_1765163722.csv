One of the first things he asked me about is sex (im a virgin and he’s not but i’ve done a couple of stuff) he says that he doesn’t care if we never have sex and tells me im his type. After he bails we go back to a strictly teacher-student relationship until a couple of weeks ago where he starts talking more and flirting. He asks me out and I say yes (again :) ), we have dinner and he’s great until we get in the car and start kissing, he asks me to blow him and I say no and he gets upset and I leave home. He texts me at 2am apologizing about his behavior and says that he feels guilty for acting the way he does. I tell him that I was bothered by it and he says he’d like to go out to talk it out, i refuse and we talk about it over texts. He apologizes again and tells me that he’d like to take it slow and make it up to me and we end up flirting a bit. He states that he wants to keep seeing me and to see where this might lead us and that he’s open to the idea of a relationship 
A week passes by and we barely text (he usually starts the convo but then stops responding) until he texts me saying he wants to see me and we meet up. We get to talking and he’s being great and we start kissing and I give him a blowjob (fully consensual). We then hang out for a bit more and tells me he’d like to see me again this week but because of his job his schedule is tight. (He has classes every day except Thursday from 5pm till 10pm). The week goes by and we dont see each other until I drunk text him on Thursday (again his day off) telling him i wanna see him. He asks me if i’m drunk and I say yes and he picks me up. I get in the car and he immediately gets me coffee and water (mind you he’s being very caring and attentive but doesn’t try to do anything) we talk for a couple of hours and I bring up the whole not-texting, not-seeing each other thing and he says he’ll be better and will be more consistent. We end up making out and he drops me off home.
This was 5 days ago and he texts me good morning, talks for a bit then stops responding. Today he asked where I am and I mention that im studying at this coffee shop and he responds with have fun and that’s it.

19
AFAB
Prescribed testosterone, taking every morning (gel)
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, OCD, gender dysphoria, + undiagnosed eating disorder
no diagnosed physical health problems 



i (19 AFAB) (on testosterone for multiple years) have been having weird symptoms since i developed my restrictive eating disorder that i have since recovered from. 



these symptoms started in around january 2024, my ed started around november 2023. i will feel fine for a few weeks at a time and then for a few days / up to a week, i have these episodes where i need to drink 6+ half liter bottles of water per day, have lots of tachycardia (during my ed it went up to 180bpm or higher when i was standing, but it’s not as bad anymore), my face is constantly red and flushed, i have a headache, chest pain, extreme exhaustion, hands constantly going between purple and cold  and then bright red and burning hot, intense brain fog, i have shortness of breath sometimes, feel “weird” like im gonna pass out if i don’t adjust how im sitting (hard to explain but i just feel unstable and i panic) and all the symptoms / feeling of dehydration despite drinking water. 



i was pre diabetic for a while since recovering from my ED , but i used my moms glucose monitor on multiple occasions recently and confirmed it’s not diabetes or anything bc that runs in my family. my fasting blood sugar was normal i think. 



i’ve had a rlly high heart rate ever since i was a teenager (around age 12) because of constant anxiety and stress (i have multiple mental health conditions, im diagnosed with autism, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and have severe OCD) and i also was on stimulants for a few years (prescribed)  until i had to stop because during my ed it gave me really bad episodes of tachycardia. i had a caffeine obsession for a while (many years). 



i have high cholesterol, it’s not too bad but higher than it should be. i also have high blood pressure but my doctor never treated it as a concern and just thought it was my anxiety. i am overweight but haven’t been this way for a long time because i only entered recovery last year. my situation with my weight is complicated and i don’t let myself check my weight anymore but im definitely fat/ chubby. 




i am on no medications currently and haven’t been for months (since spring) but i used to be on a lot at different times (prozac, zoloft, ritalin, wellbutrin, probably more) 



i think it’s important to mention that my whole life i didn’t  drink enough water, i hated it bc of my sensory issues and my mom just let me not drink it. i only started drinking water every day when i was around 18. i only really drank soda, juice, coffee, lemonade, etc before this. i think that may have caused issues. now i can drink water but only if i chug it all at once. 



i cannot drive and need my family to take me to the doctor and also schedule my appointments for me because of my autism. my mom said she can take me to the doctor soon. 



i’m sorry if this post is stupid or too long, i just wanted to know what  these symptoms could mean? is it heart failure or something else?

1ph1blm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ph1blm/about_him_about_fear_about_me/,"About him, about fear, about me","I had an amazing time with him this week. (Week 6 of talking for anyone who’s been following my dating stories)

We went to a *Kill Bill* movie marathon at this dinner-and-movie place, and afterward we went back to his apartment for cuddles and intimacy.

We woke up together, played with his two kittens, and he made me coffee before I left.

And honestly… this isn’t the first time he’s made something difficult for me feel softer.

I had to work a 12-hour shift on Thanksgiving and miss spending time with my family… and somehow he still made my Thanksgiving night feel special. He showed up for me in a small but meaningful way, and it meant more to me than I expected.

He saved me a plate of food, let me shower at his place after my long hospital shift, was excited for me to try his family’s traditional holiday drink, and was honestly so sweet and nurturing. He was really looking out for me… that’s something I haven’t felt in a long time. 

(It’s usually *me* being the sweet, nurturing one in connections/relationships so I’m truly not used to this).

That’s part of why I’m struggling now.

Because instead of letting myself enjoy these moments, my brain keeps trying to convince me he doesn’t like me as much as I think he does. It’s like the closer I feel to someone, the faster my walls start rebuilding themselves.

I know he has that old FWB situation he’s still in the process of ending. I’m the one who said he didn’t have to cut it off unless we were ready to be exclusive… so I can’t be upset if they’re still talking or even still hooking up. But the thought still lingers. It still pokes at the soft parts of me.

And then yesterday, the day after I saw him, his texting wasn’t as warm or intense.
Not cold.
Not distant.

Just slightly pulled back, enough for my nervous system to go, *“Oh no… I recognize this. This is when things usually go wrong.”*

Suddenly I’m worried he’s talking to other girls, or being just as sweet with them, or trying to “figure things out” the way he’s figuring things out with me. I’m scared I’m liking someone who might not choose me in the long run.

But, I have to remind myself… nothing he’s done actually suggests disinterest.

He said he had a busy weekend.
He still reached out.
He’s been consistent.
He’s treated me kindly.
He’s shown up for me in ways that mattered.

The problem isn’t him, it’s *my history.*

My past experiences taught me that intimacy is followed by absence.

That connection is followed by withdrawal.

That if I don’t brace myself, I’ll get blindsided.

So now I can feel my walls rebuilding, not because of anything he’s done, but because I’m afraid of letting something good matter. I’m afraid of hoping for something and then watching it slip through my fingers.

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

To admit that sometimes when things are going well, my instinct is to run, or overthink, or prepare for disappointment.

That I’m trying to unlearn that reflex.
Trying to stay open.
Trying to trust what’s happening instead of the story my fear keeps telling me.

I… I like him.
I’m just scared.
And I’m trying to let that be okay.

🍫This popcorn bark is one of my favorite treats, and it’s perfect for the holidays! Plus, this is a MUST for my other friends that love sweet-salty desserts. 

🍿 When you make popcorn for the holidays this season, don’t toss out the unpopped kernels! Instead, add them to your coffee or spice grinder and grind into a powder. To make sure no hard parts escape grinding, give it a sift to remove any hard pieces that could hurt your teeth. Then, sprinkle generously over your melted chocolate so each bite is filled with rich chocolate and salty popcorn flavor. 

All you need are: 

\+ Vegan chocolate chips 

\+ Popcorn 

\+ Flaky or coarse sea salt 

\+ Unpopped popcorn kernel dust (optional) 

💚 We make this more sustainable by using vegan ingredients, repurposing unpopped popcorn kernels instead of tossing in the trash, and letting the bark cool on an eco-friendly (compostable) parchment paper. 

🧐 Do you have a use for your unpopped kernels? Would love to hear! ",3,1765162276.0,veganrecipes,1,0.8,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  
I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:  
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

I feel pretty good with what I've made at this point, but we're trying to improve our online sales. For reference we have not done any paid ads yet, just relying on organic search and keywords (I think), as well as personal promotion on podcasts, publications, and industry events.

1ph15xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1ph15xd/my_perspective_on_how_to_build_relationshipsmake/,My perspective on how to build relationships/make friends in Berlin.,"Over the last few months I've seen quite a few posts about people having a hard time meeting people in Berlin, and it's a subject that fascinates me a lot, hence the long post! I've spoken to many, many people about it at meetups here. As someone who has lived in quite a few different European cities, (9 cities for more than 3+ months, 4 cities for 18+ months, 12 years in total), who has therefore had to rebuild my friendship group again and again, who also thinks that meeting people in Berlin is much easier than in other cities, I thought I'd give my perspective in the hope that it's useful for someone.  I guess it could apply to any city, but I'm basing a lot of this on first hand interactions with the people I've met, and conversations I've had with people who said that this feedback was helpful for them. 

- Don't confuse German directness with rudeness. I've seen conversations first hand where someone new to the city says that they went to a certain club, or they are renting in a certain area for a certain price, and a local will say, ""that's not a great club"", or, ""yeah, that's not a great area to choose to live in!"" I've seen new arrivals to the city say, ""my German isn't great, I'm looking for a job where I only need to speak English ..."", and I've seen their reaction to a local saying, ""no, I don't think you'll be successful with that approach."" They get nervous at the ""confrontation"" and they retreat into their shell, and in my opinion it's a big reason why so many people find it hard to connect with people here, as they confuse ""directness"" with ""confrontation"" or ""rudeness.""  It's not meant as a criticism of your character, or an assessment of you as a person, it's often just an opinion that is meant in an honest way, as a way to give honest feedback. The British tendency to be ""diplomatic"" and nod along and be supportive is often taken for insincerity in Germany. Just because they disagree with you, it doesn't mean that they don't like you. 

- Don't be too disheartened when people don't reply to messages.  In other countries I've lived in, (especially Spain and Portugal), if you ask if people want to come out you'll get loads of responses, whether they want to or not. In Berlin, less so, it's often just radio silence. 5 weeks in a row you'll send messages to the group chat asking if anyone is available, you'll hear nothing. On the 6th week, 8+ people are available. Don't take their non reply negatively, their non reply doesn't mean that they don't WANT to come, just that the schedule may not work for them. 

- This is contrary to what a lot of people advise, but don't limit yourself only to events that you are really passionate about.  Sometimes it doesn't matter WHAT you do, so long as you connect with the other people there. I organise get-togethers where we go to lower league Berlin football clubs, from the 4th to the 7th division, (DM me if you want to join us)  and when I mention it to some people they say, ""oh, that's not for me, I don't like football..."" Quite a few of the group aren't huge football fans though, they just use it as a way to get out and meet people, have a couple of beers, and have an event to chat at, or to explore a part of town they haven't been to, or even somewhere outside of Berlin. At many games we will spend the whole time chatting about life, and then when there is a break in the conversation we can watch the game.  I've been to Christian meetups as an atheist, I've been to tech meetups where I am not great with tech, I've been to book clubs where I didn't enjoy the books, but I've still got a lot out of the meetups as the other people attending these events were nice people. It often doesn't really matter why you have attended a meetup, the important thing is that you connect with the people there, and you'll never know if that will happen unless you turn up. You might not connect with them on so many subjects, but you may find one subject that you do connect with them on. 

- Don't read too much into Reddit threads about how tough it is to meet people in Berlin. The venn diagram between people who find it hard to leave the house/apartment and meet people, and the people who like to moan about not being able to meet people in Berlin on Reddit, has a huge crossover. When you actually meet people at meetups, usually they have great experiences of meeting people. Reddit is not real life. If you talk to people who spend their whole time on Reddit, they will tell you how isolating Berlin is. For some people, they are always on Reddit as they feel isolated in Berlin, and they are isolated in Berlin as they are always on Reddit. Don't listen to them, get out there instead.

- Keep the process of meeting people in perspective. If you go to 10 events, and 9 of them don't work, but you meet a couple of great friends at the 10th event, that's a 90% fail rate, but if you go to 50 events a year, you will pretty much have all of the friends you need, and it'll be a great success overall. Brush off the bad nights, and build on the good ones. If you also feel that the only point of going to these events is to make long-term relationships, and if you have the attitude of ""I'm not going to bother going to that event anymore, because I don't make any deep relationships there, only superficial ones"", then you would have to start to wonder why you find it so tiresome to go to them? Maybe there's a relationship between that attitude, and how difficult it is for you to build friendships? I've seen a direct correlation between people just enjoying going to meet ups, even if they never meet the people again, and naturally being able to make friends. A key part of making friends is just to like being around other people, and if you find that tiresome, you should probably look at why that is.

- I've met SO MANY people who have said ""the annoying thing about Berlin is that you'll have a great night out, but then no one wants to swap phone numbers and meet up afterwards."" Yet these same people wait for others to offer their phone number first.  Plan ahead: print out a sheet of QR code links to your WhatsApp number, cut one of them out, and when you go to a good event, leave it on the table and announce that if anyone wants your contact details, they can scan the code. If you make it easier for people to take your contact details, they will probably do it more. 

- just because an event/meetup has a bad night, it doesn't mean it's a bad meetup. I've been to 2-3 regular events in a row where there were 2-3 people at them, and then the 4th event had 30+ people at it. Sometimes it's just unpredictable, it is how it is, and I've met loads of great friends at the 10th, 15th or 20th event of a meetup. On the other hand I've seen people join a WhatsApp/Telegraph group, come to one event, they were disappointed with the amount of people there, or the other people were 15 minutes late, and they left the group immediately. Then I ran into them 5 months later and they are still annoyed at how hard it is to meet people. If you dump people at the first opportunity because things aren't perfect, don't then complain that it's hard to meet people. I once planned to meet up with someone and they couldn't make it 4 times in a row, but as I planned to also meet with other people as well, it didn't really impact me. Then when we did meet, it was great, we've got a great friendship. 

- Instead of writing a Reddit post to ask if anyone wants to meet up in Berlin, just contact the other people who have already made the same posts. Do a quick search, and loads of them will come up. I have had conversations with people who say that it's very difficult to meet up with people in Berlin, who also say that they did Reddit posts and didn't get any response, but then when I ask if they replied to anyone else's posts, they admit that they didn't. If you aren't going to contact other people who have also tried to make friends, then don't be surprised if you don't get much of a response yourself.

- There are no benefits to raising your expectations of Berlin too high. Some people move here as they think it's the epicentre of everything that they think is cool, in their mind it's a city with 10/10 potential, so when they find that they are ""only"" getting 8/10 out of the city, it's a disappointment. It's like New Year's Eve: it's not the night that's that problem, it's your expectations. Berlin is a fantastic city, but if it can't live up to your expectations, that's not the city's fault, it's yours for putting too much of a burden on it. Accept that not every night is going to be amazing, ride the peaks and the troughs. 

- Don't turn up to meetups too late. So many times there's a meetup from 7pm - 11pm, and someone will turn up at 9:30pm, at which time everyone is involved in a deep conversation, everyone has locked into their conversation, so the new arrival either feels left out, or they need to purposely interrupt the other conversations that are happening, which can come across as quite rude. They then overcompensate as they only have a short amount of time, so they come across as very intense. If you get there earlier you have a chance to chat to people more while there's less people there, in a more relaxed manner, where you can take your time and not force the conversation. 

- Don't try to dominate the conversion. If you're talking ALL OF THE TIME, don't automatically think that it's because people love to listen to you. Often they just can't work out how to move the conversation on as you're talking so much. Likewise, I've found that sometimes striking up a conversation with someone who is very quiet at a meetup can often spark the best conversations and friendships. 

- Don't waste your energy on people who don't want to agree with you. There is a difference between ""people who don't agree with you"", and ""people who don't WANT to agree with you."" Some people just like being contrary, and for some reason it's much more common in Berlin than in any other city I've lived in. You say that you like living in the city centre? ""It's too touristy."" You live outside the ring? ""Nothing happens there."" You say how much you like going to clubs? ""It was better 10 years ago.""  Everyone has their own opinion, but Berlin has more people than any other city I've seen that love to be contrary, for some reason, and if you try to win them over, to change their point of view, then you're missing the point. They WANT to disagree with you, and the more you try to win them over, the more they will dig in. Just allow them to disagree with you and move on. 

- Don't criticise the meetup that you're attending, or others that you have attended. ""Is this all that's coming tonight?! I would have thought there would be more than this!! There's barely anyone here!"" Look, it's hard sometimes to get meetups off of the ground, and the people who organise them are usually part of multiple meetup groups, so don't go undermining the effort that they put into the night, even if the turnout isn't great. They're trying their best. Likewise, if you start listing the other meetups you've been to, and why they weren't great, it's easy to come across as a very negative person, and that's not going to make people want to connect with you. 

- Don't expect the people at meetup events to solve your problems for you. Out of all of the cities I've been based in, this has also happened here way more than in any other place.  We get it: Berlin can be stressful, but that doesn't mean you should vent about how difficult it is to find a job, or a cheap apartment, or how hard it is to learn the language, or to build meaningful relationships. I've seen it multiple times where someone at a meetup just unloaded and vented all of their angst within the first few minutes of meeting people, and it doesn't exactly endeer people to you. I get why you would do it, because the people at the meet up would probably understand it much more than your family at home, but still, the people you meet have their own issues to deal with without solving your issues for you. Keep things light the first couple of times you meet people. 

- Berlin is a big city, so treat it as such. Just because an event is busy one week, doesn't mean that it will be the same the next time. With so much to do here, many people like to flitter from one event to the next. There's a thousand things to do here, don't be surprised or complain that you connect with someone at one event, and then don't see them again for a few months.   If you want to see the same people every single week, you should move to a small town. Most people move to Berlin to have a choice of different things to do. Accept that it's a big city, and that people will drop in and out of things.  Most intense relationships are formed at a time in life when you have a lot more time on your hands, such as at school, university, while doing casual jobs, and when you have more free time then the relationships you build can be a lot more intense. However, not many people in Berlin have that much free time, they may be working lower paid jobs and need to work many hours as a result, or they have a job with more responsibility, so it can be tough to build very deep relationships. I have seen it happen, but you just have to be patient. 

- Be flexible with the location of events where you meet people. Just because it's 45 minutes away by train, that's not THAT far.   The further you are willing to go, the more chance you have of meeting people that you connect with. Again, if you don't want to travel too far, move to a village, not a big city. 

- Stop trying to get people to ""adopt"" you. I've literally heard several people say, ""I'm disillusioned with drugs and clubbing, i need a friendship group with people in long term relationships, with stable jobs and apartments, as that's what my aim is now, I want to be around those people.""  Or, ""I'm finding it hard to find a good stable job, and I think it's because I'm hanging out with people with no focus. If I can find a group of people who have stable jobs, I can be more connected to that world."" I've been to meetups where I've seen someone 4 or 5 times before, with them taking no interest in chatting to me in the past events, and then when they find out that I work in a industry that they are trying to break into, suddenly they are all over you like a rash and trying to arrange to meet up for coffee. You're basically advertising that you are only meeting people to get what you can out of them, like a leech.  Most people have a hard enough time keeping on track with their own lives, let alone helping you to do the same. If you start a relationship on the basis of, ""I'm going to meet people so that I can get something out of them"", it often comes across as a lot more obvious than you realise.

How can I organize/motivate myself better so I stop doing stupid things like this?,Today was the first pretty day in a while and my gf and I wanted to take our dogs to the park. She left to DoorDash and I agreed to be the one to take them to the park. I woke up late and couldn’t motivate myself so I made a cup of coffee and as I started drinking it my friends wanted to play a game on Xbox so I figured I’d hop on for like 30 minutes while I sip my coffee and then get going. Several hours later I get a message on the Xbox from my gf asking if I’d already taken the dogs and I said no. I hopped off at this point but it was already dark outside and I knew I fucked up. I was so happy with myself for being on top of things for the past few days and I just ruined today for my dogs. I really started freaking out and tried to load them into my truck but they ended up getting away from me because I was freaking out and distracted. They ran into the highway but avoided all cars. I tried running after them but they left my sight and I didn’t know what direction the went in. About half an hour later I found them in a neighbors yard and they ran to me. It was really stressful but it could have been avoided if I didn’t stress so much about messing up so badly.

By Andrew Wong, Straits Times. 

SINGAPORE - The sale listing for a 32,000 sq ft commercial building in the crosshairs of an [ongoing money laundering probe](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/how-accused-kingpin-chen-zhi-built-an-empire-from-cambodia-to-london?ref=inline-article) in Singapore and the US was taken down just three days after it was put up.

Located in the Bukit Merah vicinity, the property known as 2 Jalan Kilang Barat was put up for sale for some $50 million on Dec 2.

No reasons were offered for the listing’s removal.

**Meanwhile, The Straits Times has learnt that the building’s owner – 25-year-old Chen Xiaoxuan – is assisting the Singapore Police Force (SPF) with its investigations into embattled Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi.**

**Her father, Mr Tan Yew Kiat, 49, was arrested over his suspected involvement in money laundering offences.**

Police had raided his office in Kung Chong Road in late November in connection with the US probe into Chen Zhi.

Originally from China, Chen Zhi heads the Prince Group, which is involved in property development and financial services.

The 38-year-old tycoon and his close adviser Chen Xiuling, or Karen Chen, were named by the US and Britain in sweeping sanctions announced on Oct 14 for their links to wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies, as well as their roles in forced labour scam compounds across Cambodia.

**The property 2 Jalan Kilang Barat was identified in the US probe as the address in Singapore for 11 companies directly linked to Chen Zhi, and three companies linked to Chen Xiuling.**

ST had earlier revealed that the building was purchased by 2JKB, a firm Ms Chen Xiaoxuan incorporated in December 2022, just seven months before it secured the property.

ESR-LOGOS REIT, which held the deed then, had reportedly divested the property for $35.3 million in November 2022, and it was later put up for sale.

The property agent who listed the property on Dec 2 did not respond to ST’s request for comments.

Ms Chen is also listed as a director of Supreme Cars Financial Services, Rolls Platform, and Cars and Coffee Leasing.

**All the firms are registered to the same 2 Jalan Kilang Barat address.**",2,1765161727.0,SingaporeRaw,3,1.0,False

1ph1253,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ph1253/down_10_pounds_in_4_weeks/,Down 10 pounds in 4 weeks,"Wanted to share some positivity after lurking for a bit. I had a bump in the relationship around a month ago that made me realize I wasn't taking care of myself. I was overweight, my diet sucked with constant snacking, zero exercise, and most of my job involved me sitting on my ass 8 hours a day then did more of the same when I got home. I weighed myself for the first time in years and found that I was over 40 pounds above where I was at in my prime 5 years ago.

So last month I got serious. Started slow with 16:8 IF and light weights at the gym so I wouldn't get too sore. About a week in I turned it up. I would as get many steps in as I could whenever I had a break at work and lifted heavier at the gym everyday after work, then hit my gym's sauna. More importantly, I did all this fasted with at most a cup of black coffee in the stomach, and most days did OMAD with one meal at the end of the day, usually a meat and a vegetable. A few times I was able to throw in a 48 hour fast where I wasn't hungry when the time came to have my one meal, so I skipped it and waited to eat until the meal at the end of the next day. I cut out a lot of the crap I was eating before including soda, processed food, chips, etc.

In my mind I was thinking I would feel fatigued because I was depriving myself of food, but I actually felt the opposite - energy, mood, and focus were better, especially at work where I was always in a fasted state. After a month of this I weighed myself and am 10 pounds down from where I started. I really like this routine I have going and I can it's much better than I what I was doing for myself in the past. Hoping to keep this up for as long as I can.

Hi Reddit. I (66F) am writing this with shaking hands because I truly cannot believe what I just heard.

To give you some background: I am a retired nurse. I worked in the ER for 40 years, pulling double shifts and missing holidays to pay for the house I live in. It’s a beautiful two-story colonial that my late husband and I bought three decades ago. It is my pride and joy, and more importantly, it is paid off.

Two years ago, my son “Malik” (32M) and his wife “Keisha” (30F) came to me with a sob story. Their rent had gone up, they were drowning in debt, and they needed a place to stay to “get back on their feet.” Being a mother, I said yes. I even gave them the Master Suite (my room) because Keisha complained that the guest room was too cramped for a couple. I moved into the smaller guest room down the hall.

It was supposed to be for six months. It has been two years. They have not paid a dime in rent.

Yesterday, I was walking up the stairs with a basket of their laundry (yes, I still wash their clothes). As I reached the landing, I heard loud voices coming from the Master Suite. The door was thin, and Keisha was shouting.

“My mom is sick, Malik! She needs to move in here. We need the Master Suite for us, and she can take the guest room.”

I paused. The guest room is where I sleep.

I heard my son ask, weak and quiet, “But what about my mom? Where does she go?”

Keisha’s answer is burned into my brain. She snapped: **“Dump her at the old folks' home! Shady Pines has a bed open. She’s had her time. This is** ***our*** **house now. We need to prioritize our future.”**

I stood there, clutching that laundry basket, waiting for Malik to explode. Waiting for him to tell her that this is *my* house, that I am not a piece of furniture to be tossed out.

Instead, I heard him sigh. “You’re right. I’ll tell her. She has to leave by the first of the month.”

I didn’t confront them. I dropped the basket—it made a huge crash—and walked back downstairs before they could see me. They think I slipped or dropped something. They don’t know I heard the plan.

Since then, Keisha has been leaving nursing home brochures on the kitchen counter with the cheapest rooms circled in red. She even invited her mother, “Brenda,” over to measure my room for new curtains while I was sitting right there.

They seem to think that because I am old and quiet, I am also stupid. They think that because they live here, they own it.

But they forgot one very important detail: **My name is the only one on the Deed.**

I have not said a word to them. Instead, I went to my safe, retrieved the original deed, and called a lawyer. Then I called the Sheriff.

Malik thinks “The First” is the day I move out. He is about to find out it’s actually the day he learns a very hard lesson about ownership.

Am I wrong for not giving them a warning? Part of me feels like a mother should always protect her child, but another part of me feels like that child died the moment he agreed to “dump” me.

# Update: “I am the landlord, not the tenant.”

It has been a week, and let me tell you, it has been the longest week of my life.

Thank you to everyone in the comments who told me to stand my ground. I read every single one of them while Keisha was busily packing up my porcelain figurines into boxes marked “Goodwill.”

Here is what went down on the First of the Month.

The morning started early. Keisha was practically vibrating with excitement. Her mother, Brenda, arrived at 8:00 AM sharp with three suitcases, looking around my living room like she was the new queen of the castle.

“Is the room ready?” Brenda asked. “I don’t do stairs well.”

Keisha smiled and said, “Almost, Mama. The van for Shady Pines is coming at 9:00 to pick up Estelle. Then we can paint.”

I was standing by the window, drinking my coffee in my best Sunday suit. I hadn’t packed a single box.

Keisha noticed and frowned. “Estelle, why aren’t you ready? The movers charge by the hour.”

I just smiled and said, “Oh, the movers are already here.”

Right on cue, two massive 26-foot moving trucks backed into the driveway.

Keisha looked confused. “Two trucks? Why? You don’t have that much stuff. And they’re huge.”

Then, a Prince George’s County Sheriff cruiser pulled up behind the trucks.

The color drained from Malik’s face. “Mom? Why is the Sheriff here?”

I put my coffee cup down. I walked to the front door and opened it. Deputy Miller (a lovely man I spoke to earlier in the week) stepped onto the porch.

“Are you Malik and Keisha Carter?” he asked.

“Yes,” Malik stammered.

The Deputy handed them a manila envelope. “This is a Writ of Possession for the property at 442 Maple Drive. The owner, Estelle V. Carter, has terminated your tenancy effective immediately due to unauthorized occupants and failure to pay rent.”

Keisha shrieked. It was a sound I’ll never forget. “What?! This is illegal! This is OUR house! She agreed to leave! She’s going to a nursing home!”

I stepped forward then. I pulled the original Deed out of my purse and held it up. The gold seal caught the sunlight.

**“I am not going anywhere, Keisha,”** I said, keeping my voice calm. **“I am not the tenant. I am the landlord. And you have two hours to get your things onto those trucks before the locks are changed.”**

Malik started crying. Actually crying. He tried to grab my hand. “Mom, please. You can’t do this. We’re family. We made a mistake.”

I pulled my hand away. “You were right about one thing, Malik. You need to prioritize your future. And you can’t do that while living off your mother.”

I spent the next three hours sitting on my porch rocker, watching the movers—whom *I* hired—clear out the Master Suite. They took the “Italian leather” sofa Keisha insisted on buying. They took Malik’s 80-inch TV. They took everything that wasn’t mine.

Keisha spent the entire time screaming on her phone to a lawyer who apparently told her she had no leg to stand on. Brenda sat on her suitcases in the driveway, smoking cigarettes and glaring at Keisha, furious that she had given up her apartment for nothing.

When the trucks were fully loaded, the foreman handed me a key to a storage unit.

I walked down the steps to where Malik was sitting, head in his hands.

“Here,” I said, handing him the storage key. “Everything is in a unit on Route 301. It’s paid for one month. After that, it’s on you.”

“Where are we supposed to sleep?” he asked, looking like a lost child.

“I heard the Holiday Inn has vacancies,” I said. “Or maybe you can find a place that accepts ‘broke energy.’”

I went back inside, closed the heavy oak door, and locked it. The locksmith arrived ten minutes later to re-key every door in the house.

It is now 9:00 PM. The house is quiet. My Master Suite is empty, but it smells like *my* house again. I put my old quilt on the air mattress in the center of the room, and tonight, I am going to sleep like a baby.

My son has sent me 30 texts apologizing, saying Keisha is “sorry” and they want to come for Sunday dinner to “talk it out.”

I haven't replied. I think I’m going to be busy on Sunday. I have a craft room to set up in the guest room, and a whole lot of peace and quiet to enjoy.

\[deep breath\] 

\[sfx: knock/doorbell, door opening\]

\[Chearful\] 

Knock knock! 

Now boarding the 4 AM early ass express shuttle! 

…

\[Huff\] 

Of course I’m on time. Only here to give you a ride to the airport- even though you know I would be happy to tag along as backup.

…

\[Exasperated\]  

What do I mean? Look, *you can* put on that fake smile around your family, but I see right through you. I know you better than that. You’re not looking forward to this at all. Christmas should not be so stressful and depressing. It is supposed to be whimsical and magical and all that bullshit. So what if we're adults? We can still enjoy ourselves around the holidays. Hell, we’re adults- the holidays are practically the only time we have to actually relax. I wish you would just put yourself first every once in a while. 

…

\[sigh\]

Well, I might not agree with your stupid decisions, but what kind of best friend would I be if I didn’t at least try to talk you out of them… all while actively enabling you? 

 …

\[taken aback\]

Hold up- *you* thought I was just going to pick you up and send you on your merry way without even trying to fight you on this? 

…

\[Confident\]

Oh, yeah. I intend to spend the entire drive doing my very best to convince you to “accidentally” miss your flight. 

…

\[sarcastic\]

Yes, what an utter tragedy! Having to spend the holidays with your best friend who adores you- as opposed to a bunch of people who only pretend to care.

…

\[mocking\]

Ooh look at us! What a big happy family! We all love each other! Look at us spending the day together in our stupid matching ugly ass sweaters! 

…

\[Knowing\]  
Umn, no, you and I both know that no one there would miss you. They only want you there for appearances. And I know that gets to you- the entire facade of it all. I wish it didn’t translate to you being such a grouch about everything Christmas related… but we can work on that.

…

\[teasing\]

Alright, fine, be grumpy then. I guess it’s probably a little too early in the morning for anything else. Honestly, it’s starting to make sense that you refuse to see reason. You don’t really even look awake yet. Did you end up getting any sleep?

…

\[flat\]

Really? Because I remember receiving a text pretty late last night… something about not having even started packing?

…

\[disappointed\]

Everytime with the procrastination! I’ll admit… there was maybe half of a second where I got my hopes up. I guess I honestly thought you might have been reconsidering the whole trip…

\[sigh\]

No, I know you already bought the ticket. I just… ugh. Look, we’ve been over it. I know what I think doesn’t matter. 

Let’s get this over with. 

…

Here, let me throw your bags in the trunk. These ones, yeah? The suitcase and duffle?

…

\[sfx: lifting/moving heavy bags\] 

\[grunting\]

Damn, okay. I know you said you got everyone books for Christmas but are you sure you didn’t swap them for bricks? Or maybe rocks? I know the lot of them deserve nothing but coal, but you’ll put Santa out of a job at this rate. 

\[exaggerated\] 

Holy shit, these *are* heavy. You sure you’re going to be able to manage them by yourself? Or that they’re not going to cost a fortune to fly with? There’s no way these are under 50 lbs/23 kg.

…

\[resigned\]

Yeah, yeah, I know that’s not going to change your mind. 

…

\[sfx: car door/trunk opening, bags loading, closing, doors opening and closing for speaker and listener, seatbelts, car starting, etc\]

Alright, hot chocolate or eggnog? I grabbed both- wasn’t sure what you’d be in the mood for. I thought about bringing you a coffee, but I figured you’d want to try to sleep on the flight.

…

\[faux professional\]

Mhm, premium service as your airport chauffeur. Make sure to give me that fancy gold star… or uh… five star? Okay, I don’t know, whatever it is- just give me a good rating on “Besties Uber” or whatever. 

…

\[teasing\]

Look, I’m just trying to help ease you into the holiday spirit. I’d hate for you to choke when it gets shoved down your throat the moment you step inside your family’s house. 

*Think* of it like an inoculation. Now, eggnog, or cocoa?

…

Solid choice. Here you *go*. 

…

\[exasperated\]

Oh, just shut up and drink it. Even if you’re hellbent on convincing everyone that you hate all of this, I can tell you need it. You can have seasonal spite and still enjoy the sweets. 

I’ve got you, okay? Even if all I can do to make things easier is give you a ride and bring a little pick-me-up, I’m doin it. 

…

\[Mortified\]

Are you serious? No, I did not spike it for you. Look, even if you’re gonna need a couple drinks before you deal with family- they’re not gonna let you through TSA if you’re drunk. 

…

Yep, that’s me- always here to think ahead and take care of you despite your insistence on making stupid decisions. 

\[sigh\] 

Sometimes, I don’t know why I bother.

…

\[exasperated again\]

No, of course you’re worth it. You know I love you, dumbass. Obviously. You think I’d do this for anyone else? 

…

\[resolute\]

Actually, you know what- I’m switching tactics. I should know better than to use logic with you- especially when you’re half asleep. Let’s try some empathy instead. 

You really gonna make me spend the holidays alone?

…

Yep, I am absolutely going to pull that card. I don’t care if it’s low. When I started working from home you wouldn’t shut up about how worried you were about me being antisocial. Imagine how much lonelier I’m going to be spending Christmas. All. By. Myself. 

…

\[getting frustrated\]

Come on, don’t make that face. It’s not like I want to guilt trip you, but if you won’t put yourself first, will you at least think about me? It’s not like I’m even asking much! 

\[earnest\]

When we spend time together you always tell me how much you enjoy being with me- how happy you are that you don’t have to pretend around me.  

I want you to be yourself. Exactly as you are.  

\[upset\]

But anytime you see them, you come back so drained- practically just a shell of yourself- every part of you distorted and forcibly rearranged after trying to be someone you’re not. 

Do you have any idea how much it hurts to see you like that?

…

\[hurt\]

Is it really so hard to choose me instead? You know that I would choose you over anyone else- everyone else. You’re all I need. I… I love you. 

\[quiet/desperate\]

Don’t you love me?

…

\[repeating flatly\] 

It’s not like that? 

\[scoff\]

Sure. Sure it’s not. But you know what? Fine. Whatever. 

I see how it is. 

…

\[deep breaths/sigh\]

\[Apologetic\]

No, no, I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get upset. Fuck, please don’t look at me like that. 

Look, if you’re still set on going… Fine, I get it. I’m sorry I pushed, okay? I’m done, I promise. I’m done. That was my last argument. 

\[forced casual\]

I’m out of options. I didn’t want to have to do this, but I guess we need to stop by my place so I can grab your present. 

…

Nah, just a quick stop. I know you’re anxious about missing your flight, but we still have plenty of time.

\[sfx: car stopping, door opening and closing, footsteps, idc how fancy you wanna get with it\]

This will only take a second, come on in.

\[sfx: house keys, door opening/closing, listener slowly begins to lose consciousness so fade in some white noise, a ringing, idk, yall are good out sound, do whatever sounds right, jc why are there so many sfx in this one, I’m sorry okay?\] 

\[concerned\]

Whoa there, you look a little unsteady. Are you alright?

…

No, no, you look really pale. I think you should sit down.

…

\[Thoughtful\]

I mean… I didn’t think the drugs would kick in so hard that quickly, but come on, let’s get you to the couch before you fall. 

\[sfx: flomp onto couch sounds\]

…

\[conversational\]

Mhm, I did say drugs. Nothing dangerous, don’t you worry. Just something to put you to sleep for a bit.

\[chuckle\]

Honestly- I thought you were onto me when you mentioned spiking your drink earlier. Really had me spooked for a moment before I realized what you meant. Either way, I’m sorry I had to lie to you, but you didn’t give me an out.

…

\[a touch condescending\]

But see, everything is going to be okay. There’s some good news anddd some bad news, but I think it all just depends on your perspective. 

See, the good news is that you’re getting some much needed rest and… 

\[sarcastic\]

…well… The bad news is that you’re definitely going to miss your flight. 

\[sarcastic af\] 

How very unfortunate. 

…

\[sfx: begin fading out the speaker’s voice\]

Awww, I have absolutely no idea what you’re trying to say- those words were far too slurred to make out. Don’t worry, just close your eyes. You’ll feel better after you’ve gotten some sleep. 

\[shushing\]

There you go. That’s it. Shhh. Everything is okay. You’re okay. Just go to sleep. 

\[sfx: speaker voice and white noise fade out\] 

\[optional if you want to ruin Christmas songs for your audience: speaker distantly fades in singing to tune of 12 days of Christmas\]

\[optional optional optional\] 

Fiveeeee feet of chains,

Four little locks,

Three sedatives,

Two fuzzy cuffs,

And a collar engraved with your name!

\[softly\]

Aww, look at that, hey there, it looks like you’re coming to! 

\[Enthusiastically\] 

Good morning, sleepyhead! 

\[sfx: listener struggling/chains/etc\]

\[worried\]

Hey! No, stop that. Please, I need you to lie still. Those cuffs are meant to be soft, but I don’t want you to hurt yourself struggling like that. 

No, no, hey, come on, you need to calm down. You’re okay, I promise! Everything is okay. 

Take some deep breaths. I know it might be a little bit difficult with the gag, but come on, you need to breathe. 

\[more firmly\]

I said, you need to breathe. 

\[frustrated\]

No, no, no! Stop thrashing like that! I said, “Stop!” 

Hey! Look at me! Come on, come on, just look at me, damn it!

\[quieter/focused\]

Hey, dumbass, you are going to pass out again if you keep hyperventilating like this. Is that what you want?

\[listener shakes head\]

\[condescending\] 

No?

Didn’t think so. 

\[forced calm\]

So. Just. Breathe. 

In and out. Like this. 

\[couple deep breaths\]

Come on. I’ve got you. You’re okay. Let’s do a couple more. It’s okay. You’re okay.

\[sfx: grabbing listener\]

No, hey, I didn’t say you could look away from me. Look into my eyes and breathe.  

\[relaxing a lil\] 

Shhh, there we go. Just like that. Shh, you’re alright. There we go… 

\[exasperated sigh\]

Finally.  

I promise, I am going to explain everything, but I need you to just relax and listen. Can you do that for me, Pet?

…

\[taunting\]

Yes, I see the confusion written across your face. You heard me right- I called you “pet.” If you want an explanation, I need you to cooperate.

…

\[trying to be patient\]

Yeahhhh, okay, so I’m going to need something a little more concrete. Do me a favor and nod for me. 

\[gently teasing\]

Mmm, the way you mumbled into that gag was cute and all, but I couldn’t make out what you were trying to say. 

…

\[sigh\]

Oh, come on, don’t just look at me. I’m not going to take it off- those pleading eyes might usually get you your way, but not this time.

Look, I know you’re panicking. I don’t blame you, but I also know you’d try to wake up the entire neighborhood screaming if I let you.  

…

\[irritated\]

No, don’t shake your head. Don’t even try to lie to me. You’re acting like I haven’t known you all your life. I know you- how you think, how you feel, how you react. 

\[calming breath\]

\[calm\]

Right now, I know you’re scared, and that’s understandable, but if you would just cooperate for a minute I’ll explain everything.

…

\[sympathetic chuckle\]

Aww that was adorable, puppy, but it almost sounded like you were trying to ask me to let you go.

…

 

\[repeating\]

Let you go…?

\[optional to the tune of Let It Snow\]

Let you go, let you go, let you go…

\[soft, regretful\]

No. No I don’t think I will. I can’t. 

…

\[serious\]

I can’t let you go and I can’t take the gag off because I need you to actually listen. 

I know that I could have said anything earlier and it wouldn’t have changed your mind because you refused to actually hear me.

I’m sorry it had to come to this, but you forced my hand. 

Now show me you’re listening. Come on, Puppy. 

…

\[satisfied\]

There we go. Good pet. Was that so hard?

…

\[sigh\]

Look, I didn’t want to have to do anything this drastic but I couldn’t let you get on that plane. I couldn’t just let you leave. 

\[insistent\] 

I couldn’t let you go back to those people. I care about you, hell, I love you- but I don’t think I can handle putting you back together after standing idly by while they break you. 

Not again.

…

I am your best friend and it’s my job to protect you. From everyone! From strangers, from your family, and damn it, when I have to, from yourself. 

\[frustrated\]

Like now- when you decide to make these insane choices! What? You think they suddenly care about you? You think they all got visits from the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future and had a miraculous change of heart? 

You are Not. This. Naive. 

Don’t look at me like that- yes, I always call you names and talk to you like you’re stupid but I know you aren't. 

You know how bad those people are for you. You know how much they hurt you and I’ll never understand why you refuse to take that into account. 

…

\[sigh\] \[voice breaking a lil\]

That’s a lie. God, I hate it so much, but I know why you do it. 

It’s because you don’t think you’re worth it.

I can see that.

Hell, what kind of friend would I be if I couldn’t? 

\[resigned\] 

But I’m going to fix it- fix you. You just have to let me. 

I’m going to prove to you that you’re worth caring for. I have been trying for so long with all of these small gestures, hoping that you’d learn, but it’s never been enough. 

This is the only thing I could think of. You left me no other choice. 

…

We were friends. But friends can make their own decisions because they know when to put themselves first. 

You don’t. You never have. 

\[more upbeat\]

And that’s why you’re not just going to be my friend anymore- you’re going to be my pet, my puppy. I even got a little bow to tie around your neck for Christmas! It’ll be cute, I promise. 

Annnnd, well, I don’t want to ruin the surprise for any of your presents but I’ll have something a little more… substantial than a bow for you to unwrap on Christmas morning. 

\[earnest\]

I know you’ll love it- because I know you. I know your style, I know what you like. I am the only one who knows you like this- the only one capable of caring for you like this. 

\[serious\]

You need someone who will prioritize you- you’ve proven time and time again that you can’t, or won’t, do it yourself. 

…

\[insistent\] 

And you don’t have to worry about being selfish- this is for me too! I brought it up before, but when I started working from home, you were so worried that I would get lonely. You tried to talk me into getting a pet so that I wouldn’t be by myself all day. You lectured me nonstop on the importance of companionship. 

But the more I thought about it the more I realized that there’s really only one person’s companionship that I ever really wanted. 

…

\[almost pleading\]

Oh, don’t look at me like that. Please, pet. You should be excited! You always complain that I never take your advice and while this might not have been exactly what you had in mind when you said that I should get myself a puppy…

Well, I mean… you offered to go to the shelter to help me pick one out, but I think this counts, right? 

You went on and on about how important it was to adopt a rescue and I simply can’t imagine a pet more in need of saving. 

\[calming\]

This is going to be good. For both of us. I promise. 

You can trust me. 

You always have, and I have never let you down. I’m not going to start now.

I know this is all really overwhelming, but once you adjust, you’ll see. We are going to have the most relaxing and carefree holiday. We can watch old movies, play music, and I have all the best Christmas treats for my precious puppy.  

\[sfx: listener struggling a little\]

\[pleading\]

Please, don’t try to argue with me. You know I hate saying no to you. 

I can’t let you talk right now because hearing you beg me to let you go- knowing that you would run right back to everyone that hurts you… I think hearing that would break me. Please. I can’t. 

\[soft\]

I just can’t, okay?  

Oh, no, no, no, please, don’t cry. Pet, please. I… Can I hold you? Will you let me do that? 

…

\[calming/disappointed\]

No, shhh, shhh, okay, I understand. I’m sorry. It’s okay. I’m not going to touch you. You’re okay. Please, you don’t need to shake your head like that, I hear you. 

\[hurt\]

God, that whimper. 

\[brokenhearted\]

And you still look so scared. 

Okay, I can see you’re going to need some time. I'm… I’m going to leave you alone for a bit so you can have some time to think about all this. 

\[quiet\] 

Just… please. Don’t pull at your restraints- you’re not getting loose from those cuffs but I don’t want you to hurt yourself trying. 

I’ll be back to check on you soon. 

\[sfx: footsteps\]

\[hesitating\]

I hate to leave you like this, pet. I know I’m scaring you and you need some time to calm down, and I wish there was a better way to comfort you, but I know this is what you need. 

It’ll be okay. Everything is going to be okay. Just take some deep breaths. I won’t leave you for too long, I promise.

1ph0x7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1ph0x7k/one_thousand_seven_hundred_and_seventyfirst_night/,One Thousand Seven Hundred And Seventy-First Night,"Today was busy. We had another snow storm, not as overwhelming as before but certainly a steady onslaught, and the first thing I did today, before even making a coffee, was go out to refill the bird feeders. For some reason I was ready and rearing to do all my chores in record time. I watered all the plants, did the laundry, a little decorating, wrapped the gifts that arrived today, made soup with the new crock pot, and even got a little writing down. Emphasis being on 'little.' 341 words is far from my best and far from where I am normally satisfied. Still that being said, considering all the other things I had to get done today, the fact that I wrote at all is a victory. The eighth chapter is off to a slow but decent start.

I would like to be more satisfied with all that I got done today but in some areas it is really just a matter quantity over quality. It turns out I do not like crock pots. Or at least I don't like making my potato soup in them. It took forever to cook and turned out thinner than I'd like. I also added too much butter but that is not the crock pots fault. I left the potatoes in there as long as it would take them to soften on the stove and not only were they hard as rocks, even on the highest temperature, the broth was so cool that I could dip my hand in without flinching if I wanted. It did heat up with time but as it turns out, I don't want it to take so much time. Maybe I just don't like making my recipe in the crock pot. Maybe I'll try making something else in it. Not anytime soon, though.

Most of the gifts I bought are hear aside from the CD and the seeds. At the moment the only thing under the tree is what I've wrapped. Father wants me to go to the mall with him tomorrow to help him find his own gift for mother plus pick out my own gift. The last time we were there I saw a tweed jacket I really liked. I would prefer it to be a surprise but beggars can't be choosers I suppose. I also would rather stay home to catch up on my writing but I'll still go out with him. Help him find a gift for mother. Maybe I can just make him a list of things I'll be interested in and he can look around while I am elsewhere.

Anyway, I am going to relax for a while. I think I've gotten enough done today to deserve a break. Maybe I'll write a little more tonight. No promises, of course.

Yours & Mine,

S.O. Skinner

1ph0vii,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ph0vii/nervous_about_upcoming_date_help/,"Nervous about upcoming date, help!"," I have recently been thrown into the dating scene by a family member who is setting me up on a blind date. I (24F) have never had a boyfriend in my life, never kissed, never held hands, never even flirted with a guy. Ever since this guy got my number (about a week ago), we have been texting every day. We send giant block text to each other, and I limit it to 1 text a day. I’m afraid that if we text too much, there won't be anything to talk about on the date.



So far, he seems like a nice guy. He loves the outdoors, and we have similar music tastes, and he seems very down-to-earth. 



If I’m being honest, I have wanted to be in a relationship for as long as I can remember. I couldn’t wait to have a special person in my life to share memories with. The only problem is I’ve never met anyone I wanted to be with. I have never met a man and thought, “I want us to be a couple”. I’ve had men ask me out; some were even good friends of mine. 



The problem is that I am a little bit asexual. I don’t want to sleep with a guy too soon into the relationship, and a lot of men don’t like that. I’m serious, I’ve had guys do a complete 180 and never talk to me again. It makes me feel like I’m only worth getting to know if I’m willing to sleep with the guy. I want to get to know you as a person before we do anything serious. I don’t think that’s too much to ask for, yet it’s a constant roadblock.

I’ve only ever been on 3 dates in my life, and after each one, I thought “I have no interest in this guy in the slightest”. In my defense, my first date was in high school, and we both mutually didn’t like each other in that way (we became good friends after).  My second date was with a guy whom I met in college, and he was a narcissist. He told me that he doesn’t need to go to class because he already knows all the material, he said when he writes an essay it doesn't need revising because he writes it perfectly the first time, he told me that he would be miserable if he had to live in a small town (this was after I told him I lived in a small town my whole life and loved it), and told me all his classmates aren’t as smart as him. He then ended the date by opening his laptop and doing homework in silence until my ride came (I thanked him for the date, he mumbled bye without even looking at me). My most recent date was with a guy who spent the whole time explaining things to me. He, unprompted, explained credit cards to me (after I told him I know how they work), then told me how he is, in fact, in credit card debt. Oh, but don’t worry, he said he could get out of it anytime he wanted to… (so I guess he is willingly in debt?). He would also interrupt me a lot. I was talking about a project I did, and then he whips out his phone and starts showing me what stuff he built. I asked him many questions about his interests, but he only asked me maybe 2 questions the whole 5-HOUR date, and it was just so he could segway into his own story. I love hearing people talk about their passion, but it’s nice to be listened to about my own now and again.



I have only ever had dates that I knew with 100% certainty that I didn’t want to go any further. After each date, I get this depressing feeling that there is something wrong with me. I know this is normal. I know a lot of people struggle to find a partner; it’s just a really defeated feeling. Especially when everyone around you is in a happy, healthy relationship, and all they ever want to talk about is why I’m single or if I’m talking to anyone. Part of me wants this date to work out just so that I don’t have these kinds of questions anymore or so that I don’t have to worry about people trying to set me up with someone.



The scariest part about this blind date is what if I don’t dislike him? What if he makes a good impression? What if he likes me and I like him? My brain can’t fathom it happening because it’s never happened in my entire life. I wouldn’t know what to do.



With this being said, I have a little bit of faith in my upcoming date, and I don’t know why. It’s probably not going to turn into anything serious, but I think he will be a better conversationalist than my past dates (fingers crossed), and I’m hoping he is a gentleman.



I just hope that if he is someone I want to go on a second date with, that he feels the same way (and not because he wants to get in my pants lol). I know this is really cheesy, but I want a guy who has manners. I want a guy who opens doors for me and pays for me on a date. I really only go on coffee dates, and I don’t mind paying for my own drink, but it would be nice to have a guy pay for me without hesitation. Especially if he’s the one asking me out. Is that asking for too much?



I guess I’m just curious, because I have never gotten that far in my dating history. Do people go on second dates with a person because they feel a connection, or because they’re giving the person a chance?



How soon into meeting someone did you get that “I want to date this person” feeling? What did it feel like?



If you know you don’t want to continue seeing him, do you tell him in person at the end of the date? Would a text afterwards be rude? What do you say?



Any advice for my blind date? Any questions I should ask him? Wish me luck!!



TL;DR I have had a few bad dates, and I'm nervous about an upcoming date. Asking if people have any advice for dating, or specifically for my blind date.",1,1765161101.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Part I: Discovery

The first time the anomaly appeared on sonar, no one thought much of it.

The Argo Deep was three weeks into its six-week survey of the Cascadia Abyssal Plain, and most of what they mapped was as monotonous as the desert — empty seafloor, gently undulating, with the occasional black smoker vent or jagged scar where tectonic plates had disagreed long before men learned to draw maps. The crew had grown used to staring at the same sets of blips and grids on the monitors. Sometimes they joked about it — how they were the most overeducated cartographers in the world, drawing the ocean’s bones one ping at a time.

But then the sonar technician, Alvarez, frowned.

It was a small thing. He had been half-asleep over the console, sipping his third cup of burnt coffee, when the sweep returned a cluster of reflections that didn’t belong.

“Dr. Keene,” he called over his shoulder. His voice carried easily in the quiet control room. “Can you take a look at this?”

Dr. Sarah Keene, chief oceanographer, leaned over. She had spent her career in deep-sea geology, her patience worn to diamond-hard tolerance by years of squinting at irregularities only to find out they were noise, or shadows, or boulders dropped from icebergs centuries ago. But Alvarez’s tone had a thread of unease in it, and she followed his gaze.

On the grid, a shape stood where nothing should. Rising from the flatness of the plain, almost vertical. Too smooth, too regular.

“Depth?” she asked.

“Just shy of seven thousand meters,” Alvarez said. His eyes flicked to her, the corners tight. “No trench nearby. No ridge.”

Keene studied the return. The object wasn’t massive by seafloor standards — maybe thirty meters high, if the readings weren’t distorted — but its angles bothered her. Not jagged like rock. Not amorphous like coral. Sharp. Deliberate.

“Probably an error,” she said at last, though even she didn’t believe it.

Still, she logged the coordinates.


---

By morning, the anomaly had become the thing everyone whispered about.

The Argo Deep carried a mixed crew: scientists, engineers, submersible pilots, a skeleton staff of Navy observers whose funding had quietly greased the expedition. They’d seen enough oddities to know most mysteries shrank under scrutiny, but boredom was a powerful fuel for rumor.

At breakfast, the pilots speculated whether it might be a shipwreck. Alvarez swore it was too big. One of the Navy men suggested it could be Cold War debris, some long-forgotten satellite or weapons platform dumped into the black.

Keene said nothing. She only watched the numbers.


---

That evening, the captain gave her the go-ahead.

“Send one of the drones,” he said, folding his arms as if bracing for disappointment. “Clear it up before the crew gets carried away.”

Keene agreed. She wanted answers too.

The ROV — Heron II — was lowered after dark, its lights slicing into the churning surface before it vanished into the endless descent. Everyone crowded the control room to watch the feed.

Five hundred meters down, blue still lingered. At a thousand, the light turned to murk. At three thousand, black swallowed everything but the drone’s beams.

The deeper it went, the quieter the room grew.

At six thousand meters, Keene felt her throat tighten. The drone’s altimeter ticked closer to the seafloor. She leaned forward, waiting.

“Contact in one hundred meters,” Alvarez said softly.

The cameras cut through the dark, showing swirls of silt, slow-drifting pelagic creatures, an occasional pale fish darting from the beams.

Then the ground appeared. Flat, rippling, empty — until something vast loomed in the distance.

Not a rock. Not a wreck.

It rose from the plain, impossible in its symmetry. A column at first glance, but as the drone approached, the truth sharpened into focus:

A face.

A face larger than the submersible itself, carved in cold stone. The eyes were hollow, gaping. The mouth hung open in a silent scream, its proportions wrong — too wide, too long, not meant for a human skull.

The crew stared in silence.

“My God,” whispered Alvarez.

Keene’s pulse thundered in her ears. The camera tilted, revealing shoulders buried in silt, a torso half-swallowed by the plain. It wasn’t just a face. It was a statue.

And no one could explain how it had come to rest nearly seven kilometers beneath the waves.




Part II: Descent

The debate lasted less than twelve hours.

Captain Morrow wanted nothing to do with it. He had signed on to ferry scientists, not to flirt with the abyss. The Navy observers were split — one cautious, one eager to claim whatever prize lay waiting on the seafloor. Keene herself pressed hardest.

“We can’t leave it unexplored,” she argued in the wardroom, standing with her palms flat against the chart table. “If this is man-made, it’s the most significant archaeological discovery of the century. No civilization on record had the technology to build at that depth. It rewrites—”

“It kills,” Morrow interrupted. His voice was flat, graveled with too many years at sea. “If something goes wrong, there’s no rescue. Not at seven thousand meters.”

Keene met his gaze. Her heart beat hard, but she didn’t look away. “That’s why we have the Scylla. She was built for this. Titanium hull, full redundancy. If we don’t dive, someone else will, and they won’t have our equipment. Or our care.”

The room fell quiet.

Finally, Lieutenant Hale — the younger Navy man, all square jaw and ambition — leaned forward. “One dive. Minimal crew. Document the site. If it’s nothing, we’re done.”

Morrow muttered something under his breath, but he didn’t argue further.

And so it was decided.


---

The Scylla waited in her cradle, gleaming under floodlights, a steel sphere built for three. Her viewports were narrow, her arms delicate, her body designed to withstand pressure that would crush most submarines to powder.

Keene would go. Alvarez, despite his nerves, volunteered to pilot — he trusted machines more than men. The third seat was filled by Lieutenant Hale, who refused to let the civilians dive without military oversight.

They launched at dawn. The sea was calm, the kind of surface stillness that always made Keene uneasy — as if the ocean, for once, was pretending to sleep.

The descent began smoothly. Numbers scrolled across the consoles, depth ticking steadily downward.

A thousand meters. The light drained away. Keene pressed her face to the viewport, watching jellyfish pulse like lanterns, their bodies ghost-pale in the dark.

Three thousand. Fish with unblinking eyes drifted past, silent as thoughts. The water grew thicker, blacker, a weight pressing from all sides.

Five thousand. Hale had stopped speaking, his earlier bravado stripped away by the immensity outside. Only Alvarez muttered occasionally, coaxing the sub, whispering like a priest at a shrine.

Six thousand, six hundred.

Keene’s breath fogged the glass. She was trying to steady her heartbeat when the seafloor appeared — an endless gray plain, dusted with silt, lifeless. And then, rising from it, the idol.


---

Up close, it dwarfed them.

The statue’s head alone was the size of the Scylla. Its features were almost human, but stretched and distorted, as though sculpted by someone who had only heard of mankind, never seen it. The eyes were vast pits. The nose was flattened, the mouth open wide enough for the submersible to glide into, if they dared.

“Christ,” Hale whispered.

Keene could barely hear him. Her own thoughts clamored, disbelieving. The material looked like stone, but smoother, darker, as if time and pressure had polished it. Carvings ran along the visible torso — spirals, notches, grooves that made no sense to the eye, as though written in an alphabet meant for something else entirely.

Alvarez angled the floodlights higher. The beams struck the hollow eyes, and for a moment it seemed as though the idol stared back.

Keene shuddered. She told herself it was only imagination, but the sensation lingered — an awareness pressing against her skin, as though something vast and waiting had noticed them.

“Get closer,” she said, her voice steadier than she felt.

Alvarez maneuvered the sub forward. The arms extended, brushing silt from the carvings. The grooves were deep, purposeful. Even after centuries, they had not eroded.

“Take samples,” Hale ordered, his tone clipped, as if speaking too loudly might wake it.

The manipulator scraped a fragment loose. The sound — a screech of metal against stone — reverberated through the hull. Keene winced. The shard clattered into the sample bin, dull and heavy.

Alvarez swore softly. “This isn’t natural,” he said. “It’s not basalt, not any formation I’ve seen.”

Keene leaned closer to the viewport, eyes drawn inexorably to the idol’s mouth. Inside the dark hollow, patterns glistened faintly, as though wet. For a moment, she thought she saw movement — a ripple, a shiver deeper within.

“Pull back,” she whispered.

But Alvarez’s hands hesitated on the controls. His eyes were wide, glassy. Hale noticed and snapped, “I said pull back!”

The sub lurched as Alvarez obeyed, backing away from the idol’s face. Keene tore her gaze from the mouth, her skin crawling.

They ascended in silence.


---

Back aboard the Argo Deep, the crew swarmed them with questions. What had they seen? What was it made of? How could it exist?

Keene answered what she could, though each word felt inadequate. She kept her eyes on the fragment Alvarez had retrieved, now sealed in a container on the lab bench. It was heavier than it should be, almost metallic, its surface etched with spirals too fine to have been cut by ancient tools.

When she touched the glass, her fingers tingled.

That night, when she finally collapsed into her bunk, sleep did not come easily. And when it did, it brought her dreams of hollow eyes staring from the dark, and a voice whispering through fathoms of water — words she did not understand, but which seemed to understand her.




Part III: The Idol

The fragment sat sealed in its container, but no one wanted to be near it.

By protocol, Keene logged it, labeled it, and placed it in the ship’s geology lab. But even through the thick plexiglass of the sample case, the shard drew attention. Crew passing through the lab would glance at it and then look away quickly, as if they’d stared too long at a body on the roadside.

It was darker than stone should be — almost black, yet it caught the light strangely, as though it swallowed it and reflected it back in patterns too complex for the eye to follow. Fine etchings ran across its surface, spirals within spirals, lines that seemed to shift when Keene wasn’t looking directly at them.

By the second day, she noticed people avoiding the lab altogether.


---

That night, the dreams began.

Keene woke gasping, drenched in sweat, certain that water had been pouring into her cabin. She’d dreamed of corridors flooding, bulkheads groaning, the ship sinking with impossible speed. But what lingered most was the face. That vast, hollow-eyed face staring at her through the dream.

At breakfast, Alvarez looked haggard. “You too?” he asked quietly, when the others weren’t listening.

She nodded.

“I dreamt…” He trailed off, his hands tightening around his mug. “It was down here. On the ship. Standing in the corridor. Too big to fit, but it was there. Watching.”

Before Keene could reply, Hale slid into the seat across from them. He hadn’t slept either — his uniform was rumpled, his eyes bloodshot.

“Whatever it is,” he muttered, “we should drop it back where it came from. Before it decides it wants more than dreams.”

Alvarez flinched. “You don’t think it’s—”

“I don’t know what it is,” Hale cut in sharply. “But I know I don’t want it here.”


---

The lab equipment disagreed with him.

On the third day, Keene ran density tests on the fragment. The readings came back inconsistent — not impossible, but off enough that she reran them. The second set contradicted the first. So did the third. The numbers seemed to shift, as though the shard were changing under her instruments.

When she tried spectroscopy, the machine flickered, screens glitching before returning only static. Alvarez checked the circuits twice; nothing was wrong.

“Like it doesn’t want to be measured,” he said softly.

Keene didn’t reply, but she thought of the eyes. The way they had seemed to follow her, even in the crushing dark.


---

By the end of the week, the ship felt different.

Conversations stopped when Keene entered a room. People spoke in low voices, as if afraid of being overheard. Meals were quicker, laughter gone. Even Captain Morrow walked with shoulders hunched, as if weighed down by invisible chains.

Every night, the dreams grew worse. Some woke to the sound of knocking at their doors. Others swore they heard whispers in the ventilation shafts, words garbled but urgent. Hale startled awake one morning with his bunkmate shaking him, after he’d begun speaking in a language no one recognized.

And through it all, the fragment remained in its case, untouched. Waiting.


---

On the eighth day, Keene found Alvarez staring at the sample. He hadn’t noticed her enter. His face was pale, drawn, eyes fixed on the spirals that writhed faintly across the black surface.

“Alvarez,” she said carefully.

He blinked, as though surfacing from deep water. His lips parted. “It’s not carved.”

“What?”

He pointed. “The lines. They’re not carved. They’re growing. Changing. Look—”

Keene leaned closer. Her skin crawled. The grooves were not static; they shifted subtly, curling into new configurations, as though something alive inside the stone was pressing against the surface.

Her stomach lurched. She backed away.

“Seal the lab,” she ordered.

But as she turned, she saw Hale standing in the doorway. He had heard everything.

And the look in his eyes told her what she feared most: he had already decided the only way to end this was to put the Scylla back in the water — and return the fragment to the idol’s waiting mouth.




Part IV: Influence

The Argo Deep had always been a quiet ship, but now the silence turned poisonous.

The crew avoided one another in the corridors. Meals were eaten quickly, in tense solitude, trays abandoned half-full. Even the hum of the engines seemed subdued, as if the ship itself had grown cautious, unwilling to draw attention.

Keene caught fragments of conversations — whispers about the fragment, mutters about omens. One sailor crossed himself when she passed, muttering under his breath. Another asked outright if she had “brought it aboard on purpose.”

It was superstition, yes. But it was spreading.


---

The dreams worsened.

Keene woke one night to find water trickling down her bunk wall. She sat up, heart hammering, and touched it. Dry. When she looked again, the rivulets were gone.

Alvarez stopped sleeping altogether. His hands shook, and his eyes darted constantly, as if searching for something just beyond the edge of vision. He confessed to her in a whisper that he’d begun hearing voices on the comm systems — static resolving into words, speaking in the same alien spirals etched into the fragment.

“It wants us back,” he said hoarsely. “It’s calling us.”

Keene wanted to dismiss it. But she had heard whispers too. Sometimes in the pipes, sometimes in the sea itself — the faint, distorted sound of someone calling her name from miles away.


---

The first accident happened on the tenth day.

One of the junior engineers was found in the machine shop, standing stock-still with a length of steel gripped in both hands. When spoken to, he didn’t respond. His lips moved soundlessly, whispering patterns in the same cadence as Alvarez’s comms.

When Hale reached for him, the man swung the steel bar without hesitation. It took three others to restrain him. He clawed and screamed until they sedated him, shouting about “eyes in the dark” and “the mouth that waits.”

The crew quarantined him in the infirmary. After that, no one wanted to pass the lab, not even to fetch supplies. The fragment lay alone, but its influence seeped through bulkheads and rivets, filling the ship like ballast.


---

Two nights later, Keene woke to a faint sound in her cabin.

Knocking.

Three taps, slow and deliberate, on the inside of her porthole.

She froze, staring at the blackness outside the glass. They were seven kilometers above the seafloor. No diver, no fish could be there. And yet — knock. Knock. Knock.

Her body moved before her mind did. She slammed the porthole cover shut and pressed her back against the wall, shaking until dawn.


---

Captain Morrow convened an emergency meeting. His voice was brittle, his face hollow.

“This ends now,” he said. “We’re jettisoning the sample. Seal it in a container and drop it overboard.”

Keene felt a flash of relief — until she saw Hale’s expression. The lieutenant’s jaw was tight, his knuckles white.

“You can’t just throw it away,” he snapped. “That thing is worth more than this entire ship. We don’t destroy discoveries. We study them.”

“It’s not your decision,” Morrow shot back. “I’m master of this vessel. And I won’t let it sink under us.”

The two men glared at each other, silence thick as oil. Finally, Hale rose.

“You’ll regret this,” he said. Then he left without saluting.


---

That night, the lab alarms tripped.

Keene was first to arrive. The containment case stood open, its glass lid shattered. The fragment was gone.

For one dreadful moment she thought it had moved on its own. But the truth came quickly: footprints in the scattered glass, leading out the door.

Hale.

She found him in the hangar, already suited up, prepping the Scylla. The fragment was cradled against his chest in a heavy-duty sample pod. His face was pale, but his eyes burned.

“It belongs down there,” he told her, voice eerily calm. “You know it does. It’s not meant for the surface.”

Keene tried to reason with him. She begged. But when Alvarez arrived, Hale only barked, “Either you’re with me, or you’ll get out of my way.”

Before they could stop him, the Scylla was in the water again.

Descending.

Carrying the fragment home.



Part V: The Awakening 

Hale

The Scylla sank into blackness, and Hale’s breath fogged the glass.

He should have been afraid. Seven thousand meters down was a death sentence if anything failed. But instead he felt exhilarated — as though something vast and benevolent had turned its gaze upon him.

The pod lay strapped to the seat beside him. Through its tiny viewport, the fragment pulsed faintly, spirals writhing like living veins. Each twist of its surface whispered in his mind, guiding his hands on the controls.

He no longer thought of himself as a trespasser. He was a messenger. A servant.

Depth ticked down: 4,000… 5,000… 6,000 meters.

And then, through the forward viewport, the seafloor bloomed into view. Flat, endless. Silent.

Until the idol rose from it like a mountain.

The hollow eyes burned in his mind. The mouth yawned wide, waiting.

Hale smiled.

“I’ve brought it back,” he whispered. “I’ve brought it home.”


---

Keene

On the Argo Deep, the control room was packed. Every eye fixed on the monitors, where Hale’s descent streamed back in eerie clarity.

Keene’s nails dug into her palms. “Cut the feed. Recall him,” she ordered.

“We can’t,” Alvarez murmured, his face waxen. “He’s locked out the uplink. It’s one-way only.”

Static fuzzed across the speakers. Beneath it came Hale’s voice, soft but certain: It’s waiting for me. Can’t you hear it?

Morrow cursed and slammed a fist against the console. “Idiot’s gonna kill himself.”

Keene shook her head slowly. “Not just himself.”

The sub drew closer to the idol. Its head filled the screen, stone mouth gaping like a cavern. The grooves along its surface shifted faintly under the floodlights, curling and uncurling in spirals that made Keene’s stomach churn.

She forced herself to look away — but others didn’t. She saw Alvarez staring too long, lips moving as if mouthing the unseen script. A petty officer slumped to the floor, whispering nonsense syllables.

The influence was bleeding through the feed itself.

Keene lunged and snapped the monitors off.

Half the crew jolted awake, gasping like drowning men.

But the damage was done.


---

Hale

The idol’s face filled his viewport.

Closer now. Close enough that he could see details not visible before: the carvings were not grooves, but openings, thin slits from which the blackness seemed to breathe. Faint streams of silt poured outward, but against all logic they carried a rhythm, like exhalations.

The fragment pulsed harder in its pod, vibrations rattling the bolts. Hale unlatched it without hesitation. He cradled it in his hands, feeling its warmth seep through the gloves.

“Here,” he whispered. “Yours.”

The mouth loomed.

He guided the Scylla forward, toward the darkness inside.


---

Keene

Klaxons wailed across the ship.

“Pressure spike in the hangar!” someone shouted.

Keene ran, heart hammering. When she reached the bay, the water gauges screamed red. Tiny rivulets spilled from the seams.

Then the lights flickered, and she heard it — a hollow boom reverberating through the hull, like something vast and heavy shifting on the ocean floor.

The idol had moved.

It was not just stone.


---

Hale

Inside the mouth, the dark was not empty.

The walls glistened, slick as flesh, lined with spirals that throbbed like veins. His floodlights caught glimpses of movement — folds contracting, something vast inhaling.

The fragment in his arms dissolved like salt, sinking into the walls, absorbed.

The statue shuddered.

And then it opened its eyes.


---

Keene

The control room went dark.

Monitors filled with static, then a single image: two hollow eyes, burning through the feed as though looking straight into the Argo Deep.

All around her, crew collapsed screaming. Some clawed at their eyes. Others simply went still, whispering in voices not their own.

Keene clutched the console, forcing herself not to look, not to listen — but the sound seeped in anyway, a voice speaking in spirals, promising that the sea would take them all.

And beneath it came another sound, deeper, older:

The sound of something rising.




Part VI Reclaiming 

The ship’s alarms screamed, metallic voices drowned beneath the roar of the sea. On the bridge, Keene clung to the console as the floor pitched under her boots. The sonar screens should have been a storm of lines and numbers, but instead they pulsed with eyes — hundreds, thousands, unblinking, layered one over another until the glass was nothing but white sclera and black pupils. They stared without depth, without mercy.

Alvarez swore and slammed a fist against the nearest panel, but it didn’t clear. He backed away until his shoulders hit the wall, his face bathed in the glow of the impossible screens.

“He’s inside it,” he whispered. His voice was child-thin. “Hale went inside.”

Keene shut her eyes, just for a second, but it didn’t help. The eyes were burned there, behind her lids.

The deck shuddered, not from waves but from something deeper — like the sea floor itself was shifting. Outside the bridge windows, black water bulged upward, glassy and wrong. Bubbles rose the size of houses. The ship listed, metal shrieking as if protesting.

“It’s coming up,” Keene said hoarsely. She pointed — and there it was.

The idol’s crown broke the surface first, jagged with barnacles. The carved eyes glowed faintly, the same unbearable light as on the screens. But the rest of it followed: shoulders broader than city blocks, arms half-buried in sediment. The sea poured off it in cataracts, thunder rolling as if a mountain had decided to rise.

The idol was not a statue.

Stone flexed. Runes ran like liquid, flowing in channels down its torso. The mouth yawned, the abyss behind Hale’s final descent gaping wide, and from within came a sound — not roar, not voice, but a rush of suction like the inhalation of a god.

The ship was dragged forward, pulled as if hooked. Consoles sparked. Men screamed on the decks below. Keene clutched the railing until her knuckles split.

The sea fractured around them, a funnel of water opening downward. Not to the trench they had mapped, but to something older. A throat. An endless passage.

Alvarez broke first. He tore free of his frozen lean against the wall and bolted, his rasping cry vanishing into the corridor. Keene staggered after him, but stopped at the bridge’s threshold, staring down into the spiraling water.

“Do you see it?” She whispered, no one around to hear. “Christ, it’s not the bottom. It never had one.”

The idol bent lower. Its hand — carved but not rock, fingers thicker than the ship’s hull — reached out with impossible slowness. The ocean did not resist it. The sky dimmed as if sun and moon both were shamed into hiding.

The ship lurched. The idol’s hand closed.

For an instant Keene thought she saw Hale again, framed in the glow of the idol’s mouth, his silhouette waving like a shadow on a wall. Then the pressure crushed the bridge, glass shattered inward, and black water roared in.

She had no time to scream. Only the eyes filled her, one final time.

The sea swallowed the Argo Deep. When the waves stilled again, there was no sign it had ever existed. 

The abyss had reclaimed all.

For centuries, coffee and tea have been more than just comforting daily rituals—they have been prized for their powerful health benefits. Modern research now confirms what many cultures have long believed: when enjoyed mindfully, both beverages can significantly support physical health, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.

# 1. Rich in Antioxidants

Both coffee and tea are loaded with antioxidants, which help protect the body from oxidative stress and free radical damage. These antioxidants play a vital role in reducing inflammation, supporting immune function, and lowering the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

* **Coffee** is one of the highest sources of antioxidants in the average Western diet.
* **Tea**, especially green and white varieties, contains powerful polyphenols like catechins that support cellular health and slow aging.

# 2. Supports Brain Health and Focus

Caffeine, found naturally in both coffee and tea, enhances alertness, concentration, and cognitive performance. Unlike energy drinks, these beverages provide a more stable energy boost without extreme spikes or crashes.

* Coffee is linked to improved memory, reaction time, and mental stamina.
* Tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes calm focus, helping reduce anxiety while maintaining alertness.

Regular consumption has also been associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

# 3. Boosts Mood and Emotional Well-Being

Both coffee and tea stimulate the release of feel-good neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. This helps elevate mood, reduce feelings of depression, and create a greater sense of motivation and enjoyment. The ritual itself—pausing for a warm drink—also encourages mindfulness and stress reduction.

# 4. Supports Heart and Metabolic Health

Moderate intake of coffee and tea has been linked to:

* Improved circulation and blood vessel function
* Lower risk of stroke and heart disease
* Better blood sugar regulation
* Enhanced fat metabolism and weight management

Green tea, in particular, is widely studied for its role in supporting healthy metabolism.

# 5. Promotes Longevity and Disease Prevention

Studies show that people who regularly drink coffee or tea tend to live longer and have lower rates of several chronic diseases. The anti-inflammatory and protective compounds work together to support long-term vitality and overall resilience.

**A Note on Balance**

While coffee and tea offer impressive benefits, moderation is key. Excessive caffeine can lead to anxiety, sleep disruption, and digestive discomfort. Most health experts recommend **2–4 cups per day** as a safe and beneficial range, depending on individual sensitivity.

**Final Thoughts**

Coffee and tea do far more than wake us up—they nourish the body, sharpen the mind, uplift the spirit, and support long-term health. When enjoyed with intention and balance, they become powerful allies in a holistic wellness lifestyle.

1ph0t44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluetooth_Speakers/comments/1ph0t44/jbl_boombox_4_my_endgame_boombox/,JBL Boombox 4: My End-Game Boombox,"After going through an absurd amount of speakers that drove my girlfriend insane, I've finally landed on the JBL Boombox 4.  
My journey is over.

Every speaker was tested both inside and outside.

The [outside environment was the park next to me in the football area at different distances](https://i.imgur.com/vHKaHzD.jpeg).  
The[ inside was on my 80kg wooden coffee table listening to it from the kitchen](https://i.imgur.com/PNpBaC5.jpeg) (what I consider a realistic scenario basically).

So [proof ](https://i.imgur.com/uRfAezu.png)of purchase for the losers, [proof](https://i.imgur.com/NBB8pGP.png) of purchase for the winner because otherwise people call me a liar or ""poor because I didn't actually buy them"" which is odd because a refund costs nothing? 🤷

It's important to note that I listen to **EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN** from Brahms to Super Mario 64 Bombomb Battlefield soundtrack. My Spotify wrapped told me I ""listened to 284 genres"" and, yeah. Most likely. So if your thing is a specific genre, then obviously my parkour and tastes will be different than yours.

I also never tried W-King or Zealot. W-King Boombox felt a bit too heavy to bring on trips (7.2kg) and Zealot... honestly it looks fine but I just didn't bother as it felt like a middle-of-the-road brand.

Marshalls look like they only produce speakers that blast forward too which is not a good use case for me.

Here's my trip through speaker purgatory:

**The Rejects:**

**Bose SoundLink Max** – The overwhelming bass can be tamed with EQ and it's honestly a very pleasant portable speaker but the parasitic battery drain is unforgivable. Watching a speaker bleed power while sitting idle is infuriating. I was losing 20% every 4-5 days and it seems to be a common thing. Dealbreaker.

I recall seeing some men in the forums say the handle is emasculating. Unsure what this is about, it's a fine comfortable handle but maybe I don't have the fragility of a teenage boy.

**Tribit Stormbox Blast 2** – I was genuinely excited for this one. Seriously you can see it through my post history and damn was I happy to test it when I got it. More ""fun"" sounding than its predecessor, better bass, improved light show. But here's the thing: it only sounds acceptable on bassy genres (EDM, trap, dubstep).

Anything else like rock, acoustic or classical sounds like hot garbage. If you listen to varied genres, hard pass. Also the X-3D mode is awful. Unusable.

I also did not read the weight before ordering and that was kind of a surprise. Coming in at over 7kg it's a bit meh to lug around in the outdoors.

I was extremely bummed out by what they did to the sound.

**Sony ULT Field 7** – This one hurt. I bought it *twice* because it sounds phenomenal indoors. Beautiful, full sound. But outdoors? The sound disperses way too aggressively. For a speaker this size and price, I need it to perform outside. Couldn't justify it. Also the app was absurdly bad. It actually ticked me off using it.

**EarFun UBoom X** – Massively overhyped. I don't know what copium the UBoom evangelists are huffing but this thing punches exactly at its price tag. No more, no less. Oluv's magic EQs didn't change that for me. Hope he got a fat paycheck from EarFun for that bribe. ""Sounds just like JBL Boombox 3"" my ass.

**Soundcore Boom 2 Plus** – Actually really impressive. Punches above its price for sound quality and the build quality/design is *exceptional*. It looks like plastic and it is but it's the kind of plastic that survives a hand grenade. The strap is dead silent, fast USB-C charging means I can top it up with a the same powerbank as I have for my phone, it floats speaker-side up (gurgled audio but at least you're not fishing it out of the lake and you know when it falls) and the app is the best speaker app I've ever used. If I was still in my 20s on a budget, I'd have kept this. Soundcore, please make a premium boombox lineup.

If it weren't for a ""more budget sound than JBL/Sony"" this would be N.1 easily. The amount of QoL useful stuff they packed into this speaker is astounding.

**Tribit Stormbox Blast** – Decent in all aspects and priced really well. I honestly get why people like it. But it could not handle sub-bass heavy tracks. [This track at 0:45](https://youtu.be/_W3OT22EF2A?t=45) made it squeal like a pig. Returned. To be noted this happens on Blast 2 but just way less.

**JBL Xtreme 4** – Perfectly fine unless you push bass past 60% volume where it kind of dies. So it was a ""skip"". Exceptional battery life and build quality though. I'm happy they started implementing swappable batteries here. Nice shoulder strap honestly.

**Sony ULT Field 5** – Too weak. Not bassy enough for what I wanted. Very expensive compared to an Ult Field 7.

**Soundcore Boom 2** – Honestly? If you want something portable that isn't a boombox, this is my recommendation. It clearly beats the Bose Max and Xtreme 4 for me. Factoring in the price, it's a no-brainer for anyone wanting something smaller. And yes the front grid looks a bit bad. But damn is this a killer package.

**The Winner: JBL Boombox 4**

Honestly I was nervous because of how horrendous it looked in pictures. Let's be super clear and honest here, it looks like a bad Chinese Knock Off of the JBL Boombox 3. It just does.

But it looks way better in-person. I don't know how to explain it but it's completely fine outside of the realm of pictures.

It's not perfect. Here are **my gripes**:

* **AC plug for $600?** Seriously expected USB-C charging at this price point. Ultra disappointing.
* **Latency is noticeable** if you're watching videos with wireless. Classic JBL honestly.
* **No shoulder strap hooks.** The Xtreme 4 has them. The *FUCKING* *Charge 6* has them. Why would you skip this on your heaviest speaker? ""WTF are you fucking stupid?""-level design choice. 3rd party straps look like ass and are often cutting massive corners in build quality.
* **Losing the 3.5mm jack**. Yeah I'm not very happy about it ngl. Granted don't have many 3.5mm devices but for that price tag... Wat?
* **That price tag.** Even I hesitated. Honestly if it wasn't the best speaker for me... yikes. We're approaching entry Macbook Air levels. For a bluetooth speaker.

**The Warnings:**

* **""Violent"" sound signature.** Vocals and instruments are EXTREMELY clear while bass is **VERY** powerful and can feel a tad strong. This creates a bit of a rollercoaster listening experience that can be fatiguing. I strongly feel this is only really an issue for the Indoors. Outdoors it sounds **incredible**. The bass boost will legitimately shake sturdy furniture. Not exaggerating. It's **perfect** **for me** that likes this kind of rumbustiousness but I can definitely 100% see this as a YMMV for many. Keep the receipt and 100% test it indoors and outdoors thoroughly.

**What's great:**

* **Premium feel and decent look** (IN PERSON ONLY - looks ***horrible*** in pictures) despite the plastic handle (more on that below because I don't see this as a con)
* **Handles dual Bluetooth connections flawlessly** \- I had issues with some speakers that say they do like massive latency or the need to reconnect
* **Absolutely ridiculous power.** No one can complain about volume. Unless you just want to complain. Approaching 100% volume indoors may deafen you.
* **They shaved off a full kilogram** while making it *more* powerful with *better* battery life. Genuinely impressive engineering. Big kudos.
* **Replaceable battery**! Yes! Thank you!
* **IP67 and floats** (kind of a requirement for me with my outdoor usage)
* **Can still play lossless** with no latency through USB C

About the metal handle: yeah, it's gone. But anyone complaining clearly never left their Boombox 3 in the sun. That metal handle would sear your skin in summer. Overall fuck that thing. It looked good but it was definitely only an indoors thing. Good riddance.

**TL;DR:** After 10+ speakers, the Boombox 4 is my endgame. Violent, powerful sound that excels outdoors. Flawed but nothing I can't live with. The search is finally over.

Side-note I did a similar thing for micro speakers where the Tribit StormBox Micro 2 was the **CLEAR** winner. Way clearer than the Boombox one.

I do not have a speaker that I use size-wise between the Micro 2 and the Boombox 4. I do not bother. I either take the Micro 2 or go ham with the Boombox 4.

I just like the idea that the connection forms over a series of these smaller interactions. Maybe the conversations get more personal despite other coworkers and patrons in their car being around. Maybe there’s drama in one of our lives.

His parents are in love, just celebrated 40 years of marriage, stay active camping, curling, golfing, weightlifting, and maintain their huge property. They’ve welcomed me and my kids into their lives and homes with open arms. When I bought my house, they helped move almost everything while I was at work, and even stored my stuff. My boyfriend and his dad still come help with yard work since I don’t have a lawnmower. (My bf and I don't live together and wont until we are married) Their family is loving, peaceful, and so much fun to be around.

My own family is the opposite. My dad was abusive, struggled with alcohol, my mom as very lazy just never tried - my parents have always been largely uninvolved. They’re estranged from almost everyone, have no friends, and constantly rely on me to do all the work so they can see my boyfriend’s amazing family.

My parents insisted on “throwing” me a birthday party. But in reality, my boyfriend and I spent hours cleaning the house. He went out to buy all the supplies, picked up the food, and we did all the work. When my parents arrived, they immediately started demanding things. At one point, my mom asked me, in front of everyone, why I didn’t serve my bf's mom coffee at the same time I served her.  Meanwhile, my bf's mom was so helpful, and just heaping me actually relax.

Being around my parents leaves me stressed, resentful, and agitated, and I hate that it spills over onto the people I love most; my kids, my boyfriend, and his parents. I’m so afraid that my own trauma and baggage will somehow ruin my relationship with a family I care about so much.

I truly resent my parents so much and I have won the lottery with him AND his family and I don't want to ruin it with my conditioning and trauma.

He has IBS, or possibly Crohns.  We will never really know, because he will not get checked out or seek medical help even though we both know he’s eventually going to die from it.  He passes a LOT of blood when he poops.  The whole toilet bowl is red, it’s awful.  But he doesn’t care enough to seek medical help or intervention.

What he has done, is cut foods out that he knows triggers the bloat and most of the time, he’s ok about following it.  These foods include beef, some pork cuts, dairy, large amounts of cheese, and certain vegetables and legumes, and COFFEE.  

Oddly specific, right?  I don’t care if he finds this thread, I am sooo sick of it.

What am I sick of?  Well, I have epilepsy.  And I have endometriosis resulting from pregnancy from our now two year old.

So at least once a month, I’m absolutely crippled.  I have never experienced pain this bad, and I don’t know how women do it.  The back pain that feels like your kidneys are exploding, added to my normal screaming legs and swelling.  It hurts to walk.  It hurts to move.  And when it hurts like that, it triggers seizures. 
For full disclosure, these are focal and complex focal seizures.  They don’t last long.  Maybe 30 seconds to a minute, but they affect my ability to reason and my response time.  Sometimes I just feel like I’m floating after.  Like I’m existing in a dream.

And this time period…this time is when I swear to god he eats whatever he feels like, drinks a whole pot of coffee by himself, and then comes to me with his fat, bloated belly and says “Feel this, I don’t feel good.”  

And then he f**ks off to lay in bed and leaves me with our toddler.  Every.  Single.  Time.

He has had to call me home from work because he was alone with the (at the time) baby, ate stuff he wasn’t supposed to, and the pain took him to ground and he couldn’t get up.  I thought it was going to be a bowel resection or a gallbladder attack, but no, just eating stuff he shouldn’t eat like a dog in a garbage bin.

Tonight is one of those nights.  I bought him his own pizza with safe stuff for him.  He ate mine.  He drank coffee all day while I worked 10 hours at the restaurant he owns and refuses to pay me for (an entirely different problem that I haven’t written about yet, but rest assured it is coming).

Add to this that our toddler was given a blue raspberry sucker that has given her the worst case of smurf diarrhea, and I have changed five diapers in two hours, literally having to soak and scrub her because it’s practically revenge of the candyman and dries instantly, suctioned to her butt like some smurf demon reincarnation of the blob… while he lounges in bed pretending the world is so cruel to him, because HE ATE THE FORBIDDEN FOODS.

And tomorrow?  Tomorrow he is going to be miserable, blood everywhere, bloated, gasping for air because he felt the need to chow through food he knew he shouldn’t eat!  

He always wants me to baby him while he is sick.  But when I am sick or hurt, he always tells me “Yeah, but you always hurt.”  He expects me to power through, and I do.  Always.  

And tonight, I had enough.  I am in sooo much pain.  From working for him, from Aunt Flo, from seizures.  I am exhausted.  And diaper number five in two hours was my breaking point.  

I told him I wasn’t going to deal with it anymore.  I wasn’t going to be the sole parent to two juveniles, even if one is 5’10” and can drink, drive, and legally make poor decisions.  I told him he needed to see a doctor, and stop eating foods that he knows trigger his issues.  He needed to take the meds I got him.  He needs to take care of himself.  He needs to stop picking the very, very predictable time of the month for his side quest to off himself for funsies.  We have a toddler, we can’t be making poor decisions that impact her.  And that I am ready to call it quits.

He told me to, “eff off and go to sleep, you [forbidden C word].  Just stfu.”

And all I said was, “Ok.”

Now he’s mad.

1ph0qid,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingAU/comments/1ph0qid/the_body_keeps_score_of_grief/,The body keeps score of grief.,"Thought I’d share a long anecdote from myself that I still think about even though it’s been months.

I spent my teen years working at a coffee shop adjacent to an independent living village + RACF. Over the years I got to know the community very well. As I progressed to working as a carer I stayed in this community and sadly saw many of the independent residents move into the RACF as they got more frail and dependent. 

I got to know one couple very well - the husband declined rapidly with dementia. It was very hard to see. The wife was so devoted, steadfast and kind throughout all the trauma and challenge of it all. The lovely man died just as I wrapped up my employment there. I spent the last year of my employment intermittently caring for him in the memory support unit. 

Fast forward to 5 years later, I’m working as a nurse in ED. I walk past and see her familiar face in one of the beds. We were elated to see each other and had a really good catch up chat. She had an ablation done privately earlier in the day and felt very off so called 000. Otherwise she looked and felt fine now. I was relieved.

I suddenly recalled an anecdote of her late husband I wanted to share. One summer morning after showering him I wanted to dress him up a bit as it was Sunday. I laughed as I told her I spent a good 10 minutes trying to wrangle on his RM William boots but he had such long and wide feet I had immense difficulty with it. It was so hot in the rooms as they had nothing but ceiling fans so sweaty and defeated I gave up and put on his dad sneakers on instead. 

She laughed and recalled he did have very large feet but loved wearing his RMs before he got unwell. Not 1 minute later her cardiac monitoring alarmed for VT whilst we were chatting. It was non sustained no more than 3 seconds but it was clear to me she was very symptomatic with it… I shat my pants… I very quickly printed of the strip to review with my in charge and staff specialist. Again, in another 3 minutes she had another non sustained run this time longer and symptomatic again. We moved her into resus and put pads on. Thankfully after a few more non sustained runs things settled well overnight and she was stable enough to be admitted under private.

I spoke to my educator about it the following day, reflecting on how terrified I was as I genuinely cared so much about her. He laughed and said ‘you brought up her dead husband who she probably can’t wait to see again… what did you expect!’. I laughed too - on reflection I know she appreciated more than anything speaking about him and remembering him but that wave of grief she experienced during the conversation was very evident in her heart rhythm.  

Our bodies keep score of the sorrow, bereavement and losses we go through. It connects us all. When we experience these pangs of grief, I believe it has a huge effect on our wellbeing so be kind to yourself.

1ph0mby,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ph0mby/help_me_help_myself/,Help me help myself.,"I’m back on the IF train. It’s been a journey coming back to this lifestyle. I was in between homes and just finally locked in my own place again. I have my routine down and feel like I needed a good hard reset to get me back into the swing of IF. I have successfully lost 40ish pounds using IF (16:8), and I have another 40 to lose. 

Last Saturday I went into it cold turkey and haven’t looked back. I was on a sweets binge the week of thanksgiving so decided to also cut out sugar (not completely) but let’s just say I’m not stopping by for baked goods on my way to work, or sipping on iced coffees - dessert who? 

In a week I’ve lost 6lbs. I forgot how this journey goes - lose a whole bunch up front and then it starts to go up and down… slowly decreasing. I think with the cut out sugars and walking more - my body has started to crave less food. I also drink a lot of water, tea, and electrolytes. I’ve noticed I get fuller faster and have been having 1-2 meals a day. I’m used to eating more, but I feel like I’m reaching for food because “it’s dinner time” or “I should eat something before bed”. 

I know this sounds dumb, but how do I differentiate “I’m not hungry, so I won’t eat” between “IF” and possibly going down a slippery slope of getting an ED? I feel like I’m obsessed with thinking and planning out my next meal - meal prepping - scanning menus if I have dinner dates. I mean I feel like this is normal while on a weight loss journey, because it’s also being prepared. But idk, am I over doing it? 

Please be kind, I’m being vulnerable here.

Dustin Clark's life seemed to be falling apart. He was in his Sophomore year at the University and life had been good. On a visit home he received the news that his parents were divorcing. He couldn't believe it. He knew there had been tension between his parents, but there always had been. They always seemed to work through the tough times. 

According to his Mom, his Dad had several affairs, and always blamed it on something. He would promise he had learned his lesson and it would never happen again. But it always did. She had always stuck it out to protect her family, but now that he, as the youngest, was at the University, she couldn't take it anymore. She had always given up everything that she wanted for her husband. Now she was in her forties and was just finished with all of his lies. She wanted to live for herself while she still had a chance.

Dustin tried to talk to his Dad about what was going on, but his Dad wouldn't talk about it. He cut the conversation short and said he had to go meet with someone about business. Dustin saw the someone later when he was in town. She and his Dad were walking along with their arms wrapped around each other, whispering in each other's ear and giggling like a couple of school kids. His Dad was not even trying to be discreet about it. 

Dustin stepped up and said “Hi Dad.” His Dad didn't act ashamed at all, rather he acted all proud. Dustin took a good look at the girl. She didn't look much older than he was, wearing a skimpy outfit that was meant to entice. His Dad introduced her as Amber, saying that they worked together. So this was the important business that his Dad had dumped him for. He now understood why his mother was divorcing him. But Dustin felt that someone had just gutted him. He couldn't believe that his Dad was acting like this. It really hurt, all that he had grown up believing about his Dad had just been completely shattered.

Dustin returned to school in a fog. He couldn't focus on anything. He didn't want to talk to anyone. He couldn't tell anyone what was happening. He just wanted to be alone. He couldn't make sense of what had happened, how could he explain it to anyone else? His girlfriend that he had been dating for eight months was really upset with how he was acting and broke up with him. He couldn't seem to concentrate in his classes and it was starting to affect his grades. 
Dustin knew he had to do something to turn things around, to get a grip. He decided to go to the beach. It was just over 90 miles . Instead of driving, he decided to take his mountain bike. He was an avid rider and would cover 40-50 miles in a day riding trails so he figured he would be able to cover the distance to the beach in a day. It would be a challenge but he needed that to help clear his head. His plan was to leave early in the morning on Friday and ride all day until he got there. He would get a room then spend a day at the beach then ride back to the University. It sounded like just what he needed to clear his head and be able to focus again.

When Dustin took off, Dustin threw in a change of clothes into his back pack with some snacks and water, then strapped the backpack on the back of his bike. He was ready to take off bright and early.

What Dustin didn't anticipate was the town he was going to was a town that had big city problems. There were gangs, drugs, violence, and a blighted area near the beach. The town responded by declaring the area as an Urban Renewal Area. They condemned several blocks of the worst area that was close to the beach. The town partnered with developers and built some nice hotels, restaurants, shops, and also some offices and luxury condos. Streets were rerouted and renamed. The idea was that the area would be self-sustaining and offer better job opportunities for the people being displaced. The only problem was that the printed and online maps were not yet updated.

When Dustin arrived in town it was starting to get dark, and his map was telling him to go down streets that were not there. Instead of streets, there were large buildings. He saw a young guy standing on a corner and asked him how to get to the beach. What Dustin didn't know is that he was talking to a gang wannabe. He was given directions that took him right into the heart of the gang's territory. The kid called the gang to tell them Dustin was on his way so they were ready.

When Dustin came riding up, the gang jumped him and robbed him. Dustin was hit on the head hard and had lost consciousness for a bit. When he came to, Dustin started to take stock of what his situation was. They had taken his bike and everything he had with him. They took his wallet and phone. The one good thing was they didn't find the cash he had stashed in his sock. Dustin had always been taught to never carry cash in your wallet, to always keep your money separate. He had no way of contacting anyone. His head was throbbing and he was having trouble walking so he sat down. 

As he was sitting there, a sleazy looking man with slicked back hair wearing several gold chains approached him. He started to talk to Dustin and said his name was Jim. Would Dustin like to make some easy money? All Justin would have to lure girls away from their group to where Jim would be waiting. And with all the pretty young girls around all the time, it would be easy. Jim went on to explain that he was part of a network that would pay well for pretty young girls. The network had contacts in the police and with local and state politicians so they could operate and not worry about getting caught. Jim assured him he was totally untouchable. If Justin would do his job right, he could be rich. Jim was so arrogant, he stank. Justin didn't want anything to do with this person.

Justin struggled to stand up. He wanted to get away from this guy. Jim took Justin's arm and was starting to lead him away. Justin knew whatever was going on, it was not going to end well for him. Since Jim had a strong hold on his arm and wasn't letting go, Justin acted like he was vomiting. Once he did this, Jim suddenly let go of his arm and stepped back. As soon as he did, Justin took off running as fast and long as he could. It wasn't hard to outrun Jim because Jim was so out of shape. 

Justin kept running until he came to a main street. He saw a diner that was open with several people inside so he felt comfortable going in there. He sat where he could watch the door. The waitress that took his order, Brittany, was keeping an eye on Justin. She had a feeling that something wasn't right. Whenever the door opened Justin would jump. He didn't appear to be a criminal, but she wanted to talk to him to make sure that he wasn't going to dine and dash. 

Brittany went up and started to talk to Justin. She asked how his evening was going? Justin shook his head. “You wouldn't believe it if I told you.” That peaked Brittany’s interest. “Has it been that good or that bad?” Someone came in through the door and Justin jumped. Brittany saw the look of fear flash across his face. Justin then slowly spoke “I came to visit the beach so I could clear my head from everything going on in my life right now. I wound up getting lost because my maps were not reflecting what is actually there. I got into a rough area of town and was robbed, they took everything, then I think some guy was trying to kidnap me. So I just want to get something to eat and take it from there.”

Brittany asked if he needed her to cover the meal. Justin smiled and said “Thank you for the offer, but I've always been taught to keep my cash separate, so they never found my cash. I will be able to pay.” Brittany started to insist on calling the police but Justin started to panic. He told her absolutely not. He feared what Jim said about the network including the police. He couldn't risk getting involved with that again. 

Brittany kept an eye on Justin. He was starting to show some signs of shock but she wasn't sure yet. If what he had told her was true, it was possible. He finished eating and paid the bill. As he stood up he wobbled then hit the floor hard. Brittany, who was working her way through nursing school by being a waitress, ran up to assess him. She found where he had been hit over the head when he was attacked. He had a  gash on his head that his hair covered so she hadn't seen it. He  needed attention. Brittany said she was going to call 911. Justin called out in a voice that stopped her in her tracks. “Don't! If you call, I will be gone before they get here.”

Brittany took Justin to the back and got the first aid kit. She cleaned up the gash the best she could. She dabbed some antibiotics on it and said she hoped it didn't hurt too much. Justin gave her a big smile. She told him that he really needed to have that looked at. Justin gave her a look that was a mix of panic and terror. Brittany had seen looks from patients when she was doing clinical at the ER. It was always from someone who had experienced something truly horrific. She knew there was a lot more than what he had told her. 

Brittany asked what he was going to do? Justin didn't know, just find the beach and possibly spend the night on the beach. Brittany told him “There's no way you are in any shape to be walking around. You can black out and there is a good chance you will die. I can't let you do that. You are going to come home with me where I can keep an eye on you.” 

On the way to Brittany's place, she told him “My roommate is out of town for the weekend, so you can spend the night there if you don't mind sleeping on the couch. And I have a boyfriend so don't even be getting any ideas.” Justin assured her the way he was feeling, there wasn't anything that could be further from his mind. 

When they got to the apartment, Brittany looked at him and told him matter of factly “You need to get cleaned up.” She ran a bath for him. She told him when he got undressed to toss his clothes out of the door and she would wash them for him. Justin's face turned bright red. Brittany simply said that she was a nurse, she had seen worse before. 

So Justin did as he was told. As he slid into the bath, Justin felt the tension draining from his body. He usually took showers and had forgotten how good it felt to take a bath. He leaned back and started to breathe slow and deep. The next thing he knew he woke to a knock on the door. Brittany asked “How are you doing in there? Is everything OK? There is a towel on the counter for you.” Justin answered hurriedly “Yes, I'm fine. I'll be finished in just a minute.” He didn't have a clue how long he had been asleep, but the water had cooled off. He scrubbed off quickly then jumped out of the tub. He found the towel on the counter and dried off. He couldn't remember seeing the towel there before, did Brittany come in while he was asleep? It might have been, but it would remain a mystery. 

Justin cracked the door open to ask about his clothes and they were folded in a neat pile in front of the door. He quickly dressed and stepped out. Brittany had prepared snacks and while he was in the bath, and had made the couch into a bed. Justin's now ex-girlfriend had never done anything like this for him. He was amazed.

Brittany told him that she needed to trim around the gash so the hair would not get into it and cause an infection. She then laughed when she saw his hesitation. “Don't worry. I'm not going to scalp you. Actually it really won't be noticeable. Once it heals, you can comb your hair as normal, and nobody will notice. Trust me!” She then gave him a devilish grin.
Brittany then trimmed around the gash and applied more antibiotics. Once she finished she had him look at it in the mirror. 

“Not bad, it didn't hurt at all. You have a nice touch.”Justin said with a smile. Brittany blushed and said “I bet you say that to all the girls.” 

They ate the snacks and chatted for a little bit then Brittany gave him a serious look and told him “I have to get to bed. I have a long shift tomorrow and have to get some rest. I keep my door locked and I sleep lightly. If you try to come in, you will regret it. That's a promise.” 

Justin gave her a sad smile and a “I have already had more wild and exciting ‘adventures’ today than I can handle. I just want to get some rest so I can think straight. I am definitely not looking for anything more than that.” Brittany just gave him a look that said we will see without words being spoken. 

As soon as Justin's head hit the pillow he was out and didn't even stir until the next morning. When he woke up he heard Brittany in the kitchen. He grabbed his clothes and got dressed quickly. He then folded the bedding and left it on the couch. He went into the kitchen and said “Good Morning” to Brittany. She smiled brightly and told him he was right on time. She was just finishing preparing breakfast. She had a full breakfast ready for him. She had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and coffee ready to put on the table. As they were eating, Brittany asked what he was planning for the day. Justin said he was going to try to get in touch with someone to wire him the money to catch a bus back to the University. Brittany almost exploded. “You are not going anywhere yet. You aren't out of the woods yet. You need at least another day to rest. If you start running around you can pass out again and where will you be then? Besides, you don't want to run into the people from yesterday, do you?” 

Justin couldn't argue with that logic. He agreed to stay at the apartment. She left her phone with him so he could get in touch with her if he had anything that didn't feel right. She showed him how the diner was saved in her contacts under work. She would call him whenever she could to check on him. She was working the 10-6 shift today so she would be back by 6:30. She showed him the TV remote and told him to make himself at home. Justin told her he may take a nap so Brittany turned up the volume of the ringer on her phone up all the way. She told him to make sure he answered when she called, otherwise she would be racing home to check on him. 

Justin was impressed. He never had anyone who cared like that. Certainly not his ex, even his mother had never been concerned unless she couldn't reach him for several hours. Justin realized that it actually felt really good. He could get used to this. He would have to put that quality on his list for his next girlfriend. Actually someone like Brittany would be perfect for him. Too bad she already had a boyfriend. 

Brittany called to check in. He asked if it would be OK if he made a sandwich? She answered “Absolutely Not!” Then she giggled and said “Of course, I told you to make yourself at home, didn't I? Take whatever you want.” Justin chuckled to himself when she hung up. She had a sense of humor too. As he sat there looking at her phone he noticed the shortcut for her photos. He wanted to click on it, but went in to make a sandwich instead. After he ate, he cleaned up the dishes and put everything away. He carefully washed and dried his hands. 

He then picked up her phone again. He was losing the battle raging within. He had to see what type of guy Brittany would fall for. He opened up her photos. They were not what he was expecting. 
They were mostly Brittany in scrubs with others in scrubs. There were many of her with patients in hospital beds and of tiny babies in incubators. There were some of her on a beach with others. If there was a guy in the photo, it was obvious that he was with one of the other girls there. There was only one of her in a swim suit and she was walking up out of the water in a modest one  piece. He lingered on that one. It was obvious that she had a nice figure, but was modest about it. If Brittany did have a boyfriend, he was either extremely camera shy or very long distance. He only hoped he didn't exist.

There wasn't anything in Brittany's photos like what his ex would post. His ex fancied herself as a lifestyle influencer. She posted all sorts of flirty poses with her friends and at parties. The ones his ex posted with him, he had to have a certain look. He had to look hot and desirable. To Justin it all seemed exhausting. His ex liked to pose in the tiniest of bikinis that barely covered anything. When Justin said anything about it, she would scream and gaslight him about being controlling and completely unreasonable. Justin was actually happy when she broke up with him. He knew that if he broke up with her, she would have spun the story so he was the controlling jerk. He was happy that he was away from it now.

When Brittany got home she asked Justin if he wanted to go to the beach, since that was what he had come for. She told him that she knew of a beach that few people knew of so there was not usually anyone else around. Justin then jokingly asked “If that is the case, are you sure you trust me?”

Brittany threw back “If you try any funny business, you are going to be the one that is sorry. I know your weak spots, remember?”

Brittany jumped in the shower and emerged a few minutes later wearing jeans, T-shirt, and a zip up hoodie. She announced that she was ready if he was. When they got to the beach access, Justin understood why so few knew about it. It was tucked at the very back of a subdivision. She had to park on the street and walk down to the access. If you didn't know it was there, you would walk right by it and never know it. Justin asked how in the world did she ever find it. Brittany admitted that her father was the developer for the subdivision. He was required to have a public beach access so he camouflaged it best he could. He didn't want people flocking in disturbing the homeowners.

Once they got to the beach, there was a steep drop down. Justin took Brittany’s hand to help her down. He let go of her hand once she was down, but she held on to his for a second longer. She showed him her favorite spot. The ocean had eroded the bank further back so they sat back there. It was a private spot that also sheltered them from the cool evening breeze. Brittany pulled out a beach towel from her bag and Justin helped her spread it out. Brittany then pulled out two containers and handed Justin one. It was a meal from the diner. She apologized for it not being nicer. Justin assured her it couldn't get any better, here he was having a great meal on a beautiful beach with a lady that was just as beautiful. How could it get any better than this? Brittany was embarrassed and didn't try to add to that. To change the subject, she asked why he had come to the beach?

Justin took a deep breath, exhaled and started to speak slowly. He explained “I had gone home for a visit, and was told that my parents were getting a divorce. They had rough times, but had always gotten through them. It turned out that my Dad was a serial cheater. I actually ran into my Dad on the street downtown and he and his mistress were draped all over each other. The worst part was my Dad acted all proud that he had a girlfriend less than half his age. I mean she was my age. It really affected me. I couldn't focus during my classes. I was losing it. Then my girlfriend broke up with me suddenly.” 

He then looked at Brittany and told her “To be honest, that part with my girlfriend breaking up with me didn't bother me at all. I was happy she broke up with me. When I first started to date her, I thought she was so far out of my league, I should be happy just to be acknowledged by her. Then I started to notice how fake she was. She didn't want a boyfriend, she wanted an accessory. You have shown me more concern  though you barely know me, then she did in the eight months of me supposedly being her boyfriend. I am so happy that I don't have to deal with that anymore. I thought that a tough ride and sitting by the beach would help me clear my mind. I find that watching the waves makes it feel like all my troubles are being washed away.”

Besides my wife and adult children I am not very social so this is outside my comfort zone but if it gets people out walking I am willing to give it a go.

In a modern-day San Francisco where magical creatures and monsters live openly among humans, Oddie Saltbrook, a witty yet anxious merman florist, has carved out a quiet, comfortable life on land. His days are simple: make sure Rosalind, his distractible mothkin coworker, actually shows up (and stays focused); grab coffee from Lily, his human best friend and secret crush, at the café down the street; and keep his boss’s beloved flower shop, Maple Street Florals, running as retirement looms. 

Life may be small, but it’s safe — and it’s his.

That is, until a secretive real estate tycoon sets their sights on the neighborhood. What seems like a straightforward corporate buyout soon reveals layers of strange magic and dangerous secrets lurking just beneath the surface.

To save his job and prove his worth to his traditional underwater family, he’ll have to embrace the magic, face down a mysterious threat, and risk everything, including his heart, for a future he can finally call his own.

Sea Blooms is an 72,000-word adult cozy urban fantasy set in modern-day San Francisco, where magical beings live openly among humans. It will appeal to fans of Legends & Lattes and The House in the Cerulean Sea, with its mix of found family, a wholesome romance, and lighthearted magic.

My boyfriend is very very poor. If I needed even $2 from him, he wouldn't have it. I knew this going into the relationship. He's in school full time, and has been having a  hard time getting a job, so, that's where his finances are at. Because of this, I never ask him for anything and every time we are together, we do things that don't cost anything (walk in the park, or just hang out watching tv). I have helped him financially a few times (I got us coffee a few times, dinner a few times as well and when we hang out at home, its always at my place and I cook him dinner 100% of the time. For this, my grocery bills are always around $40 each time). I also helped him financially with school when his funding came in short for the semester (or else he would get dropped from the program!). I'm not well off - I work and have minimum savings.

He treats me well, as in, he compliments me here and there, tells me I'm beautiful, he holds my hand when we're out, he's pretty affectionate in general.. things like that. He recently called me his ""princess"" and I told him that I don't really feel like a princess when I'm with him, as I associate being called a princess belongs to a girl who gets treated like one, but he replied that with ""I tell you you're beautiful all the time"" in which I responded that I believe if you have a liking for someone, of course you're going to find them beautiful and calling me beautiful doesn't equate to being a princess - calling your girl a princess, to me, is when a woman is taken out for dates here and there, gets surprises (big or small) here and there, gets birthday gifts... things like that. Basically, I'd rather be treated like a princess than being called one (without being treated like one).

Anyway, he didn't like this at all, and our conversation ended, he wanted to get off the phone (because he was upset) and I calmly told him goodnight. I don't think I'm wrong here - but I would like your thoughts on this?",1,1765159769.0,u_ArtichokeConstant112,0,1.0,False

When they were found, their lower bodies were still locked together.
From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?""
""Get out of here! We need to talk!""
""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""
I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.",1,1765159711.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?""
""Get out of here! We need to talk!""
""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""
I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.",1,1765159700.0,NovelLinks,1,1.0,False

First of all thank you so much for regularly updating this sub reddit with success stories and tips. I got the motivation to finally start looking at ya’ll so yeah, thank you once again. 
To give a little perspective to things i’m M30, 128kgs, 6ft tall. I intend to lose around 30-40kgs
I don’t really know what my problem is but i tend to eat a lot of junk food and have a love for soda’s and delicious fast food. No meal can go without one or 2 including breakfast. 
I mostly eat fast food, twice a day and snack sometimes as well. Oh and the sweet coffee’s throughout the day. 
I wanted to ask ya’ll, so  i took my first shot of mounjaro 2.5mg and i haven’t really been feeling anything yet which is making my mind race to doubts if it’s working on me or not.. is this normal? Ate like half a sub and a diet coke for dinner and it’s been 3hrs since my meal and i’m kinda feeling hungry not really badly but the feeling is still there. When do i actually start feeling its effects and if its working for me?
I have been obese almost all my life and it hasn’t been a fun journey. I believe the most annoying thing would be to go shopping and most of the times buy the boring collection they’d have on the plus size section. In the past months i have gained and through out the years i have tried multiple things including intermittent fasting,hitting the gym regularly, cardio for hours, HIIT, diets, Keto diet (Worked but had to stop since i got my Gallbladder removed) but i’d always give into my cravings or just lose motivation because of not much progress or just burn out in general
So after a lot of research and reading success stories i had my first shot yesterday and i’m more than hopeful. 
I apologise for my bad english, it isn’t my first language.

In the quiet, limitless depths of her slumber, Talia La'Nae Morgan drifted through the ephemeral realm of dreams, a place where the veil between worlds thinned and visions danced. Secrets whispered like the rustling of ancient, forgotten lore, and the air itself felt heavy with unfulfilled destiny. This was not a realm of simple fantasy, but a conduit to truths buried deep within the earth's consciousness.
The stark, pale moonlight painted the small forest clearing in a shimmering, ethereal blue, making the runes, complex, arcane symbols of sorcerer and Draconic power, carved intricately into the hard earth gleam and pulse like living, molten things. The air was thick with the scent of earth and raw, unstable magic.
Annabelle, her mother, knelt at the exact center of the immense circle, her normally vibrant dragon eyes dimmed with agonizing regret but fierce with maternal determination. Nathaniel, her father, stood stoically beside her, his hand resting protectively on her shoulder, his powerful aura humming loudly and visibly, like the immense sound of wind rushing through ancient, living trees. Between them, on the ground, a small child, Talia, slept deeply and silently, swaddled securely in a protective blue shawl woven with warding threads.
“She simply won’t be safe if the Council or the Hunters can sense her true nature,” Nathaniel said quietly, his voice heavy with the weight of this impossible decision. “Her being draws far too much attention. It would be far, far too much raw power for one small child to carry in this fractured world.”
Annabelle’s throat tightened, a strangled sound escaping her. “I will not stand by and let them hunt her like they relentlessly hunted me. I won’t. It will be tragically worse for her, Nathaniel, once the dark factions realize what powerful lineage she truly carries, what combination she is.” Her strong, dark claws dug deeply into the black earth, as Nathaniel's grip tightened ever so slightly.
The warlock stepped forward, shrouded in a hooded cloak, only his immensely vibrant blue eyes showing. A powerful, ancient practitioner and trusted friend, stepped forward, his hands moving quickly and precisely through the heavily charged air, weaving complex symbols that shimmered momentarily in pulsing gold and virulent green light before settling into the spell matrix.
""This sealing magic,” the warlock rasped, his voice strained by the immense power he was wielding, “will fully fold her true essence beneath a thick, impenetrable veil of illusion and denial. Neither the most powerful dragon nor the keenest sorcerer will be able to sense her true, powerful bloodline or the scope of her unique power. But hear my warning, Annabelle and Nathaniel: if the bond finds her, it will inevitably awaken what sleeps.”
Annabelle’s claws dug deeper, drawing blood from her own palms. “Then, for now, let it sleep, Warlock. Let the true fire sleep until she is old enough, strong enough, to genuinely fight and choose her own path.”
Nathaniel bent low, his body trembling, and kissed the child’s small, warm forehead, the scent of his magic momentarily mingling with the sealant. “Until she can choose her fate, not have it chosen for her.”
The final wave of the spell fell like a soft, pervasive storm, folding the promise of iridescent scales and vast wings into a deep, protected silence.

Chapter 1: The Cold Case and Warmth
	As Talia's eyelids fluttered open, she found herself suspended in that delicate, disorienting space between the crushing weight of the prophetic dream and the mundane press of reality. Her body felt both exhausted and hyper-alert, her senses sharpened by the intensity of the vision. She emerged from her covers with a practiced, graceful poise, but a dense, lingering sense of spiritual unease settled within her, the palpable feeling that an integral, ancient memory, steeped in world-altering magic, was whispering just beyond the razor-thin grasp of her consciousness. The dream was not a flight of fancy; it was a memory trying to resurface.
	She sat up slowly, her movement measured, the fine silk sheets rustling against her skin with a soft, counterpoint sound. The heavy, sweet scent of blooming jasmine, carried on a gentle draft from the open window, drifted through the soft, pearlescent hues of the pre-dawn light. Drawing a deep, shaky breath, she tried to consciously shake off the dream’s sticky, spectral remnants, but the sensation of urgency persisted, like a ghostly, chilling hand reaching out from the deepest recess of her subconscious mind, pulling her toward an unavoidable fate.
	The sudden, cold contact of the polished wooden floor against her bare feet sent a momentary shiver through her, a small physical shock that anchored her back to the present. Her hand instinctively drifted to the delicate silver chain resting on her nightstand. The amulet, a circular piece of polished obsidian intricately carved with a barely discernible, serpentine design, shimmered subtly in the early morning light, radiating a faint, almost imperceptible warmth. As the first, strong rays of true sunlight spilled through the window, illuminating the room in a vibrant, golden glow, she began her morning ritual, starting with her amulet. It had been a gift from her parents when she was very young.
	She lifted it to her neck, the silver cool against her skin, and for a measured breath, she focused on her reflection. She was sorcerer, the elegant impossibly high cheekbones were a giveaway to anyone who knew what to look for, but the true complication lay deeper. She was a half-breed, concealing a potent, volatile drop of the near-mythic Dragon bloodline from her mother's side. This ritual wasn’t just a preparation for the day; it was a necessary discipline. The sorcerer demanded control and subtlety, perfect for a detective in the human world. The Dragon blood, however, was a furnace of raw, explosive power, a chaotic force that always threatened to surface at the wrong moments as an uncontrollable flicker in her eyes or a brief, scorching heat across her palms. The life of a cop was stressful enough; the life of a cop who could accidentally incinerate evidence was impossible. Her secret was the price of her normalcy, and every morning, she had to re-sheathe the dragon.
	It was a precise, subtle routine of mental and physical preparation that signaled the start of a day defined by duty, order, and the relentless pursuit of justice.
	Her destination was the city police station, a monolithic, granite symbol of societal order that had served as her functional second home for the last six years. It was a place where she had excelled, driven by an unshakeable belief that the world's shadows could be countered by diligence.
	She slowed at the red light, a solitary, composed figure amidst the sharp surge of the morning rush. Men and women in impeccably tailored suits hurried past, their expressions etched with the focused purpose of commerce and routine. The vibrant, multi-layered symphony of city life swirled relentlessly around her: the rhythmic, driving drumming of hundreds of footsteps, the aggressive, distant honking of morning traffic, the low, powerful rumble of distant construction machinery marking the city's ceaseless growth. She paused to watch a coffee vendor animatedly discussing the alarming rise in the cost of specific imported goods with a well-dressed, perpetually rushed customer, a tableau of normal, predictable life.
	The stark contrast between the relentless, mundane routine of everyday life and the police station was a reminder of the inherent fragility of peace and the dark, predatory shadows that always lurked just beneath the city’s polished surface. This was the reality she dealt with, a reality she enforced, yet the memory of her dream now cast doubt on the very structure of her reality.
	The familiar, complex echoes of camaraderie, the scent of stale coffee, and the dull thud of opening drawers greeted her as she entered the precinct. It was amidst this backdrop that she heard the murmurs of the latest missing person case. A somber, minor-key melody that seemed to be playing on an endless, chilling loop in this sector of the city.
	In the briefing room, a space saturated with the smell of old paper and nervous energy, she listened with a deeply furrowed brow and a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Captain Hawks, a man whose stern features were softened only by the deep, ethical commitment in his eyes, stood before them with a somber, uncharacteristic air of defeat.
	""Good morning, everyone,"" he began, his voice commanding but laced with fatigue. ""We have received official notice regarding the disappearance of Dana Carter and Carl Jenkins. They are experienced hikers who were last seen registering up by the North Creek Trailhead and have failed to return from their planned weekend journey. The alarm was raised by Mrs. Jenkins when her son, Carl, didn't return as planned.""
	The report was chilling: so far five individuals had vanished without a single trace in the span of a month. Their absence cast a dense, palpable pall of unease and growing fear over the otherwise bustling group.
	The gathered officers leaned forward as one, their expressions a professional mix of focused concern and grim determination. As the early morning shadows danced across the polished, institutional floor, Captain Hawks addressed her directly, his words carrying the singular weight of his trust in her intuition.
	""Talia, before you leave the station to assist with coordinating the initial ground search,"" he said, holding her gaze, ""I want you to make an immediate visit to Mrs. Jenkins' house. See what other information we can gather. Specifically, anyone she knows who might have an issue with Carl or Dana. Focus on any odd details.""
	""Yes, Captain,"" she replied, a steely glint igniting in her eyes. The puzzle was growing more complex, and she felt the familiar pull of the chase. With a silent sense of purpose, she strode out of the briefing room, heading toward her workspace.
	In the cozy, dimly lit confines of the break room, the sharp, appealing fragrance of freshly brewed coffee mingled harmoniously with the slightly dusty, nostalgic aroma of aged wood and paper files. Standing briefly at the metal-edged counter, she absorbed the strained, tranquil ambiance, the soft glow of fluorescent lights casting long, geometric shadows across the linoleum floor. Stirring her coffee as she thought over the earlier briefing.
	Her ears, however, always acutely attuned to the subtle, underlying symphony of the station, the hushed whispers of the autumn wind outside, the gentle rustling of case files. Her attention was drawn sharply to a quiet dialogue emanating from the nearest table.
	Lieutenant Jameson, a man of refined, often cynical bearing, leaned back in his worn chair beside Officer Thompson, a spirited, if somewhat overly talkative, young officer who was quickly burning out. They were engaged in a discussion as old as the profession itself.
	""It's a cruel, ridiculous joke, ain't it, Thompson?"" Jameson's voice was low, melodic, and dangerously weary. “Like I have nothing better to do with my time, and now Frank just switches out schedules. Audrey had a birthday party planned this weekend, but now I won't make it.”
	Thompson sighed softly, the sound heavy with shared discontent. ""Indeed, Lieutenant. The sheer number of hours, the sacrifices we make, all for a scrap that doesn't even support us.""
	""The impossible long hours we endure, the agonizing meager pay, and the constant danger... it makes the whole thing feel like a bad joke on most days,"" Jameson added, stirring his lukewarm coffee.
	""Right,"" Thompson agreed, his voice dropping further. ""Our families seem to forget about us entirely. We're too tired to really do anything constructive on our days off. We're ghosts in our own homes. Then, when we do have plans, they change schedules around to suit themselves.""
	Their shared, palpable discontent hung heavy in the air, a silent, damning reminder of the immense, unsustainable burdens borne by those who had pledged their lives to public service. Talia felt a pang of sympathy as she walked away, but her mind was elsewhere.
	She approached her locker, a gleaming, standardized beacon of steel, to quickly gather the necessary gear for the anticipated expedition into the rugged woods.
	As she worked the combination, she overheard hushed, quick-fire words from the row on the other side of hers. Unlike the other conversations around her, there was something mysterious in their hushed tones. She knew from their voices it was Rollins and Price, these officers hadn't been present at Captain Hawks' briefing.
	""Have you heard any more details about the missing people, the first three?"" one officer murmured, his tone anxious.
	""Yeah, I have, and the official talk is growing louder by the day,"" his companion replied, checking his watch nervously. ""Some are starting to say these disappearances are no mere string of bad luck or coincidence, but a careful, concerted plan being executed by a new, highly organized criminal gang that's moving into the territory.""
	As if sensing the sudden, silent presence of an authority figure, the two men immediately hushed their conversation and turned to leave, melting quickly into the throng of uniformed officers moving down the central hall.
	Talia’s keen intuition, sharpened by years of relentless observation and a growing sense of the city’s unseen pulse, pricked violently at her senses. Their clandestine conversation, veiled in secrecy and urgency, hinted strongly at a hidden, unofficial agenda, or perhaps knowledge they were specifically instructed not to share. The gang theory was new, she had picked up the cold cases from the last several years, and for some reason, that just felt too simple. A sudden, almost painful rush of heat spiked in her hands, a telltale sign that the Dragon impulse to burn away the falsehood was rising. She quickly curled her fingers into a tight fist, using the familiar, grounding pain of her nails digging into her palms to force the heat back down. Her sorcerer control asserted itself, patience, silence, observation. The gang theory felt too simple because the real answer was likely supernatural, and she couldn't risk revealing the truth of her own power to pursue it.
	She quickly retrieved the necessary gear and with a glint of absolute determination sparking in her eyes she thought about everything. The overall puzzle was intricate, its pieces scattered across the city's surface and depths, but the seasoned investigator within her was entirely prepared to venture into the unknown, guided by her unique intuition and fueled by a powerful, restless curiosity. With a silent, unshakeable resolve, she steeled herself for the hunt.  But first, she had to face the difficult, emotionally draining task of speaking with a distraught, grieving family member.
	Leaving the station's underground garage in her trusty, unmarked black cruiser, she steered toward the quiet, residential outskirts. Her vehicle came to a slow, respectful rest before a modest, well-kept house nestled in a quaint, highly manicured cul-de-sac. The sheer normality of the setting felt oppressive, a mask over the emerging horror.
	A soft, mournful whisper of wind brushed against the trimmed hedges as she walked up the stone-lined path to Mrs. Jenkins' front door. She raised her arm, her official badge catching the cool morning light with a momentary flash, and rapped upon the door with a gentle, professional rhythm.
	The door creaked open slowly, revealing Mrs. Jenkins, a figure of inherent grace whose eyes, red-rimmed and exhausted, held a deep blend of both wisdom and profound, recent weariness. ""Officer Talia,"" she murmured, the syllables weighted with barely controlled apprehension and a desperate hope.
	""Mrs. Jenkins, may I please come in? I'd like to sit down and talk to you about Carl and Dana,"" Talia said with a perfectly balanced blend of deep sympathy and firm, professional resolve.
	Once inside the quiet, flower-scented living room, Mrs. Jenkins began, her voice brittle. ""I keep replaying the last time I spoke to Carl. He was in such good spirits. They were prepared for the trip, and I had absolutely no reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary when they left. I know he's not some little child, but he was looking forward to starting his new job at the docks.""
A sob escaped her. ""Carl has never, ever stayed away this long without calling, and he would never miss this opportunity,"" she worried, twisting a lace handkerchief. ""They only packed supplies for the weekend, enough for three or four days, tops. The nights are getting so bitterly cold up in those canyons.""
	""I understand,"" Talia assured her, her voice calm and steady. ""That's precisely why we have our best specialized people on this case. Our aerial and ground teams are focusing on the most probable search areas, cross-referencing their known routes. We are doing everything humanly possible, Mrs. Jenkins.""
	""Have they found anything at all? A discarded water bottle, a broken hiking pole, anything that tells you they even made it to the trail?""
	""Not yet, I'm afraid. But the area is exceptionally rugged, deeply forested terrain. We are expanding our search radius dramatically and bringing in more specialized resources. No effort is being spared, I promise you."" Talia then gently pivoted to the crucial line of questioning. ""Mrs. Jenkins, do you know of anyone that Carl or Dana might have had a recent, serious issue with? A disgruntled colleague, a rival for Dana's affection, anything?""
	""Not that I can think of."" Mrs. Jenkins sat silently for a painful moment, her gaze lost in the distance, then suddenly dropped her head into her hands. ""Oh, why didn't I just forbid him from dating that girl? We never cared for her much, anyways. Well not so much her, just that family of hers.  The way that Uncle of hers... he has his hands in some very odd businesses around the waterfront. Just odd, he is.""
	This detail immediately caught Talia’s surprise. She smoothly pulled out her small, leather-bound notebook and pen. ""What Uncle is this, Mrs. Jenkins, and what specific businesses are you referring to near the waterfront?""
	""Oh, I'm not exactly sure of the name of the business, but Dana's Uncle Alex is the one. Mrs. Schneider and the ladies were talking just last week about all the massive lay-offs happening down at the main city docks. And then, suddenly, Dana's Uncle Alex was hiring those same men to go elsewhere to work. Mrs. Cara, down the street, said she receives a check each week now from her Harold, but hasn't so much as spoken one single word to him on the phone since he started with Alex. It's all just a very odd, unsettling business arrangement, Talia.""
	Talia paused, making a precise, coded note of this new development. The vague mention of suspicious employment, secrecy, and specific geography, the waterfront, suggested a plausible criminal element far more complex than a simple hiker being lost. ""I'll speak to the Captain immediately when I get back. Perhaps we can figure out what that whole arrangement is about. But for now, please know we are going to stay focused on getting Carl and Dana safely back home.""
	""I just want them back,"" Mrs. Jenkins repeated, the mantra of the distraught.
	""We do too, Mrs. Jenkins,"" Talia said simply, rising to her feet.
	They spoke a bit longer, discussing local, inconsequential gossip, the details of recent factory cuts, the arrival of a new specialty seamstress in the neighborhood, the quality of a new baker’s sourdough, basic, comforting things that helped ease Mrs. Jenkins’ shattered reality.

1ph0bty,https://www.reddit.com/r/EU5/comments/1ph0bty/colonizing_tips_i_wish_i_knew/,Colonizing Tips I wish I knew,"Just finished my first run as colonial Spain, this is my understanding and I could be wrong but these are my observations. Please take with a grain of salt.


 Begin with the end in mind.

1. Control deep ports before establishing colonies.

Begin with shaping what you want the trade node to look like. The ultimate goal is to push the trade to your home markets. To have the best trade capacity you want to control the trade center. You need to hold a province area or two around your future trade center for this reason and more reasons I’ll cover later. Use the port capacity map view and snag the best port for yourself and set it up before creating the colony. If you do not do this the colonies will create their own trade centers that you do not control and there’s a lot you could be missing out on.

2. Developing the port and trade capacity will take time. 

You need lumber and stone in your provinces and masons for building like anywhere else. My biggest problem was getting enough pops to my port to work in the buildings.

3. Making good selections.

There is plenty of virtually worthless land. Select only sites that have goods you want (gold, chilis, coco, tobacco, cotton, cloves, pepper, tea etc), land you need to extend naval bases where you want to go (South Africa, Gold Coast, etc, or that has favorable climate. Columbia region is great after the Colombian exchange to farm old world good coffee for example. Everything else is probably not worth it at the current state of the game.

Keep in mind making a military colony on the other side of the world to help you fight wars may seem like a good idea but you need to be able to beat them if they revolt.

4. Keep colonies small and weak.

Divert trade is a must, enable scutage is good for a little extra income early and keeping them untouched by your wars if you don’t need them. Making your colonies military good to help you in wars will haunt you later. Don’t have mega colonies for one whole region, break them up into smaller colonies. They will expand by themselves so if you leave an open area, they will continue expanding and getting bigger so keep that in mind.

4. Prepare for age of revolutions

Colonies will revolt constantly seemingly for subbing their toe on the furniture you manufactured for them.
A significant factor is the sum of all colonies power relative to yours for some reason. This means if you colonize everything like EU4 then you effectively have too many and they will be much more difficult to manage faster. Remove scutage and when one revolts the others can help you take it back later.

5. Age of whack a mole (revolutions).

Your trade centers are now your landing pads to fight them or store troops to fight them. They will revolt multiple times no matter what you do. 60% loyally, 0% average liberty desire, allowing them in your parliament, and enabling loyalists will NOT save you. There is no button that says retain colony in the peace deal, you need to agree to their independence through a peace deal for them to succeed in their revolt. That means when you peace deal, keeping them is implied since you are enforcing peace.

Get as much war score as you can, take money, war reps, take more of their land, and dismantle forts so it’s easier the next revolt. Later in the game control is easier with naval ideas so snake along the coast also cuts down on their ability to maintain a fleet to fight you.

If you go to war with them, all the dip things you did are reset. You will need to add again loyalists, parliament etc. After the war, don’t reanable scutage and then they can help in other revolts.

You will likely be juggling the revolution in your home country so making fighting your colonies easier is very necessary. Nothing worse than a bonehead transport mistake that sunk your ships and now your armies are stuck in the colonies until you can make more.

6. Trade companies

I started playing around later in the campaign but you can make a trade company the same way you make a vassal but use the extra territory tab. They don’t control land but work like the banks by building buildings and making you money. There’s a lot of confusion I’ve seen from exactly what “owner” means in the overseas trade buildings you can build in another countries territory. After I made a trade company, they built a bunch of them in my colonies and my trade capacity over doubled. I don’t know about them long term but they seemed very beneficial with no downside. In addition to trade capacity, they also send you a decent amount of money.

In the tech, it says trade company headquarters and a few other buildings. I don’t think they are for the player to build but are available for the trade company to now build but I could be wrong. My trade companies built a HQ in the region I assigned and build buildings by themselves. 

Trade company mechanics seem to imprint on the country they are in. If you build in a country that isn’t your culture/religion they have liberty desire modifiers I noticed.

I hope this helps someone.

>A death mask. Is there a reason for a death mask? It is barely a physical resemblance -- in death, the muscles so relaxed, the face so without the animating spark. A death mask is almost an intrusion on a beautiful memory. And yet, who could throw away the casting of a loved one? Who would not want to study it longingly, as the distance freight train blows its mournful tone?

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe.

1ph04zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATLHousing/comments/1ph04zl/best_worth_the_price_apartments/,Best - worth the price Apartments,"I have been relentlessly searching for a place (long distance) to rent for a family of 3 (couple + adult autistic son) that’s within a 30-45 min commute to Doraville/Dunwoody (it’s where his job is transferring him). 

I am looking for commentary from people who actually lived in any apartment they recommend/or advise to absolutely stay away from. And that it has been in the last 12 months (I will read comments from people who are like - I loved XYZ… lived there from 2015-2018… bruh… it’s 2025… almost 2026.  That was damn near a decade ago… lots and lots change lol).

We prefer a 3 bedroom or 2 bedroom with a “study” or… if the amenities are just that freaking top notch… just a straight 2 bedroom. I would like to finish out no more than $4,000 for total housing expenses (rent, weird fees, utilities, etc). My husband and I have not lived in an apartment in 20+ years. We have either rented a house or last 15 yrs - bought a house wherever we lived. But he keeps getting promoted regularly and transferred and it’s just not worth the costs and time and energy that it takes to do that. Apartment’s are a lot easier to cut and run from (if his company transfers him the future- any remaining time on a lease will be paid by them but if we own - no such protection).

Anyway- if anyone can offer thoughts on their current/recent experiences- that would be awesome. Here is the wishlist. If you have any suggestions that can come close to matching our “dream” apartment - I’d be mighty mighty appreciated. 

Wishlist 
•$4,000 (including all associated costs to live there)
•2-3 bedrooms 
•1100+ sqft
•Quiet - well insulated 
•Rules are clear and enforced 
•Safe and Clean and PEST FREE
•Nice gym - updated equipment - not so small/busy that it’s nearly impossible to find a free machine 
•Walkable or near public transportation 
- my son works but does not drive. Currently either his father drives him or he takes Uber. (Poor guy spends a large chunk of his paycheck on Uber)
- it would also be nice to be within walking distance of a grocery store, a coffee shop, a non-fast food restaurant, and a bar
•Shower (not a bathtub in Master) - not a deal breaker but I hate tubs. The older I get (almost 50 - the more I appreciate safety rails in bathrooms lol)
•Parking garage or covered parking that is gated
•Apartment sponsored activities/workshops 
•Strong/Reliable Internet - I work from home. In a pinch I can hot spot, but reliable internet is extremely important 
•Keyless entry 
•24/7 On-site staff
•Indoor access 
•Reliable elevator(s)
•Cool Amenities I have not thought of that just really make your apartment really worth the money (regardless of whether or not you actually utilize them - sometimes just knowing they exist is enough lol)

If you also wouldn’t mind the below questions as well. 
1) Taking rent out of the equation - what are your expenses? Utilities/fees/parking/etc?
2) Can you/do they have a way to mount TV’s or do they have to have a stand?
3) Can Master fit King sized bed?
4) If your apartment does have sponsored activities - what kind and how often?
5) How bad is the “every day” noise? Lots of noisy kids? Obnoxious neighbors? Late night parties? Pool hours enforced? 

Sorry so long. It’s so hard to do this long distance. And reviews on Google and other sites are all shills. When you see names over and over it’s like - 👌. I have never ever bothered to remember the name of someone who showed me an apartment unless it went badly or they did something way over and above. Those reviews are a joke. And then the flip side is - 99% of people could be ecstatic. 1% are disgruntled, but who almost only will leave the review? So that skews it even more. I’m hoping that I can get a little more honest perspective. 

PS - don’t want to rent a home (at least not at this stage of the hunt) because we just don’t want to deal with things like yard work. And we like the idea of (maybe - if possible) being in walking distance to some basic things. Plus a gym that’s an elevator ride away instead of a car ride. And community activities. I overall have a fear of being in a car so I don’t go out much. I leave the house maybe every 45 days or so (bc husband makes me - he is paranoid I will develop agoraphobia lol). If most of my wishlist can’t be met - we probably will start looking at a house to rent but right now I have (I think anyway haha) good reason to not want to, but depending how much more stressed I get trying to hunt an apartment - I just might say forget it 😜

So Reddit fam - what say you?  Can you offer fair unfiltered thoughts?

I’m a 40-year-old gay guy living in East Boulder and hoping to find another guy who’d be up for a low-key hang a few evenings a week after work to rewatch the *original* Twin Peaks. It could be fun to pair it with a casual dinner beforehand or some takeout. Probably around 6pm.



I’m just looking for a non-romantic buddy to decompress with after work. No pressure, no expectations, just good food and Lynchian weirdness. 



I’ve got two very friendly dogs at home in case you have allergies.

Cleaned every nook, crany, and space per usual.  The only difference is I also did the coffee outlet cleaning with the special disk and cleaning tablet. (I have never done this before) Followed the instructions in the book. Seemed like it went according to plan, followed by the usual descale process. No settings were changed, using the same espresso beans, water still comes out of the coffee outlet, hot water tap, and steamer like it should without port filter in place.....HOWEVER, for some reason now, when I engage the portafilter into the coffee outlet and start brew, nothing happens, it makes the normal noises, the pressure gage DOES NOT move, and the water backflows down into the tray instead of coming through the coffee puck. I have tried pre ground coarser grounds, water comes through but not as much, still no pressure gage.  I have taken the top off and verified that top hoses are not clogged. Filter screens are not clogged. 2 descalers rounds have been done.

*August 22:*

Doctor Weber takes care to keep himself hidden from public life. It’s been three days since we passed Raleigh, and I fear it will be another day still before we make it out of the Blue Ridge and into the Piedmont. Professor Maxwell tells me that patience is a virtue and that before we know it, we’ll be nestled comfortably back home in Virginia, richer than Midas and more revered than Solomon. I dare not point out that half the reason it’s taken us so long to make it down south is that he insisted on driving us down, missing the turn in Spartansburg, and leading us down a mountain path instead of the coastline I was so excited to see.   
  
I mustn't be so critical of my mentor, however. Such an accomplished scientist would rarely take his assistant to an almost literal goldmine of discovery. He hasn’t told me much of this Professor Weber. Only whatever he has developed in his greenhouse could change the course of not only our lives but the lives of every starving American living in Hoovervilles and working long weeks for the sake of a quarter. 

I believe he lost a poor relative to starvation sometime last year, though I do not know the conditions surrounding it. I do recall his melancholic state and how often bourbon glasses surrounded his desk. I often heard him muttering a name over and over in his liquor dreams, though male or female I have no clue. 

What I do know is that the man I sit next to now is not that man. Here, in this truck, his blue eyes transfixed on the road, I see a man of firm resolve. The beard he’s grown in the last few months makes him look like a prospector shoved into a suit. His bowtie is scrappy as is his mood. He hasn’t even stopped to ask what I’m writing but has occasionally gone off on winded stories of how he and his family traveled through these hills often when he was a young boy. He alludes to having a sibling of some sort but drops them from conversation as soon as they’re brought up.   
  
I read once that a Spanish explorer traversed this area in search of gold and glory. He died somewhere in the South I believe. However, I am certain that if his spirit lives on, it is in the heart of my dear mentor.   
  
  
  
The road grows bumpy and it’s becoming harder to write. Will resume on smoother ground.   
  
  
  
\*12pm- or thereabouts:\*  
  
The oddest people live in this region. Though not unkind, they are certainly a peculiar bunch. We have stopped off at a roadside gas station and drugstore, and a small barbecue hut within walking distance of the place has given me a picnic table to pen my remaining thoughts. After I ate, one of the waitresses- I believe that’s what she is at least- approached me and asked where I was heading. I told her that I was a botanist and that my mentor and I were traveling on business. I was able to point out the professor to her from my seat. He was leaning against the truck, smoking a cigar, and apparently in his own conversation with a clean-shaven man in overalls. Judging by their points and gestures, it was most likely for directions.   
  
She gave him an odd look, then wiped her hand on her apron. She was older than both of us by the look of her, with curly white hair tucked neatly under a paper cap. Her clothes had the occasional grease stain and her makeup was smudged from what I could only imagine was the heat of a kitchen, and yet she stared at us both as if we were tramps in a department store.   
  
“Where you folks headin’ again?” she asked.   
  
“I forget the name exactly,” I told her, “but I believe its name is something like ‘Portley’ or a place near there.”  
  
Her expression changed from confused disdain to wide-eyed concern. She almost dropped her ticket book as she spun around and took a seat next to me.   
  
“Listen here, son,” she told me, “Ifin it is Portley you’re going, I suggest you and your professor fella turn right on around and go back to wherever it was you come.”  
  
I protested, saying we’d already traveled all this way, and followed by asking what it was that had her so scared. She shook her head and said:  
  
“They ain't right up there. They just ain’t. Every once in a while, one of their ilk comes through on the way to Augusta or Athens or someplace like that, but every time they do there’s trouble.”  
  
She went on to mutter something about the way they move or talk, but she shook herself and coughed. When she stopped, she pulled out something from her pocket and placed it on the table near my paper plate. 	

“My family was one of the last catholic families in this region before they got tired of driving an hour to the nearest church every Sunday and converted to Baptist. Ifin you’re headin’ that way, you’ll want this.”

The object was a cheap rosary that was missing more than a few beads and bore a metal cross long since smudged from bright bronze to dull gold. It was brighter around the base, meaning someone had once committed regularly to hold it and pray the creed with it, making their mount cavalry out of a fist and bent knees. It was clearly a family heirloom, and one I tried to refuse, but the woman would have none of it.  
  
“Take it, by God, and by God may it either serve you or convince you to go back. The devil walks the earth, boy, and in Georgia his home is Portley. Anything or anyone there is not worth your soul.”  
  
I wanted to ask her more, but before I knew it, she was gone and the door to the hut was slammed shut. The sliding order door was closed immeadiately after and I was left alone at my picnic bench, surrounded by the goliath pines and oaks that spread out like an ocean around me. I find myself thumbing through the beads remaining on the rosary, reliving a bit of my childhood and more than likely disappointing my poor late mother as I stumble through them. I cannot help but think of the waitress’ words as I write.   
  
This cross reminds me of the rosary Marie once had.  
  
The professor approaches.   
  
  
  
\*Addendum:\*  
  
It seems my mentor was able to secure directions and we are now back in the car heading towards Portley. I haven’t mentioned anything to him about the rosary or the things the waitress said. However, I have noticed something concerning as we stumble into the growing dusk. There is now an old black bible seated between us. When I asked the professor where he’d gotten it, he laughed.   
  
“It’s the damnedest thing, John,” he said. “The gas station owner gave me directions then ran back inside to grab this. He shoved it on me and refused to take it back. Superstitious bunch down here.”  
  
I faked a laugh and he didn’t seem to notice. All is quiet now, but the closer we draw to the doctor’s house and the life-changing development he’s made in his reclusive home, I’m nervous.   
  
Must sleep it off.   
  
  
  
\*7:25 PM\*  
  
I am stirred awake by the roughness of the road. There is a pain in my neck from the angle I placed my head and my vision is hazy. \~\~I am filled with-\~\~  
  
I am tired.   
  
The professor is still awake but is not up for conversation- thus why I’m writing in my journal for the fourth time in a day. What he has said is that Portley is within the next ten miles, according to the directions the gas station owner gave us. I look forward to a bed, all concerns aside, and pray the doctor has food waiting for us. 

I have a pain in my throat now that makes me cough regularly. The professor isn’t noticeably bothered by this and has only said, “allergies,” in response to my racket. The pain and the coughing make me think of Marie. Her condition and loss still haunt me, it seems. Her, my mother… I fear I have a curse on me that causes women to die.

I cannot wait to have tea or coffee. Anything hot to make this go down and to shove those ideas out of my mind.   
  
I see a road sign coming up on our right.  
  
Finally,   
  
  
  
\*August 23- close to 5 AM:\*  
  
I have much to write despite it being so early. I’m struggling to rationalize and place all of the events from the latter half of my journey with what logically makes sense, so I think this is the best way to lay it all out.   
  
I find myself holding the rosary in my other hand while I write, but I can’t say solidly as to why.   
  
I’ll start with our entry.  
  
When we made it into town, I started to find myself disillusioned with the fears the waitress and gas station owner had so thoroughly tried to instill in me. The buildings were sparse, and the main road of the town was lined with very few stores. There were occasional houses and one or two plots that looked like small farms, but nothing overtly stood out. 

There were not many people out, most likely due to the time of night, but there were some. A group of men in their suspenders and work shirts huddled around a tiny of a storefront, resting on metal chairs and smoking their pipes and cigarettes. I could smell the cheap tobacco from the truck, and I still find its odor on my cardigan. 

From what I was told, I half expected them to throw bottles or rocks as we rode through the street. I expected a gun or knife to greet our tires or at least angry screams. None of that happened. They did the opposite. They waved at us.   
  
As I write that, I fear I underplay the effect it had on me. When I say they \*waived\* at us, I mean \*they\* waived at us. Every single one of them. Five men were in that group in total, and as soon as we passed by, every single one raised their (right?) hand, waved, and smiled.   
  
The professor waved back at them, but I could tell from his grip on the steering wheel, this bothered him too.   
  
We passed by a woman walking in a very rigid fashion, almost painfully erect in her posture, and she did the same. Same hand. Broad smile.   
  
It was when passing what looked like the county sheriff’s office, we were greeted by a dark-haired man in a tan deputy's uniform. He too waved and smiled, but lowered them as he stepped down from his perch on the sidewalk and approached the curb. The professor slowed the car down and- albeit reluctantly- rolled the window down.   
  
Taking the man in, I was shocked by how smooth his skin was and by how energetic he looked on what I could only assume was the tail-end of a long shift. I had an idea as to how his voice would sound this far down South, and almost jokingly wondered to myself if we’d even be able to understand him.   
  
Imagine how red my cheeks became as he spoke not only without an accent but almost impossibly proper English. I couldn’t begin to place a speech pattern. I still can’t, though the voice is still fresh in my mind.  
  
“Hello there,” he said. “Where are you from?”  
  
The professor explained we were heading to the residence of Doctor Andre Weber and if he had any directions. He didn’t drop his smile as he said:  
  
“Oh yes! Doctor Andre. He is indeed a very good doctor. He will no doubt expect you. You cannot keep him waiting.” 

There was an awkward pause before the professor asked again where his residence was, reading the address from our telegram that had invited us there in the first place.  I expected to hear another tight response but was more startled when the deputy shot his hand up and gestured down a right turn. He did not say any other direction besides this. The professor thanked him, prompting a, “It is my pleasure! Please enjoy your time in Portley!” but nothing else. 

His hand did not drop as he did this. 

We drove away and as we did, I noticed the deputy staring at us from the side-view mirror. He dropped his arm almost mechanically and turned sharply on his heels before walking away. He did so in the same fashion as the woman we’d seen before. 

“Friendly people,” Professor Maxwell said.

 I remember laughing, but not for the humor of it all. Another detail I noticed, just as the main road faded from view, was that the back sides of the buildings- though their fronts were pristine- were covered in thick blankets of ivy and Kudzu.  I do not know what to make of this, nor why it bothers me so much. I will write more about this later if my mind can make sense of it.

We spent another twenty minutes driving through the growing dark as cedar and oak trees loomed over us with long branches that reminded me of fingers. Each one bent unnaturally and scrapped against the roof of the truck. The road didn’t grow sturdier either, and at one point it was so rough I was convinced that we were going to pop a tire on some sharp rock or another. I would have worried about deer or other passing animals as well if I wasn’t so dazed from the jostling and neck pain I wrote of earlier. 

Winding road after winding road went on until finally, like some specter rising from the grave, the silhouette of a manor house came into view. In a large clearing where the land merged into a grand winding hill, the sharp treeline was conquered by the rising point of a roof. The amber lights of lit windows came into view and before I could process the magnitude of this large two-story house that sat strangely out of place in the middle of the Georgia woods, we were already parking in the driveway. 

“Finally!” Maxwell said, putting the truck in park. “I thought for sure we’d miss it.”

“Are you sure this is it?” I asked him. I know that sounds like a stupid question in retrospect, but I believe it was brought about by the unease that had settled into my system from the encounters we had in the town. I also still can’t shake the feeling of decay and overgrowth that lingers in the whole house. In the dark, I could see no discernable thing wrong with its face. However, the sides of the building were overrun with blossoming vines and ivy that outstretched to the wood paneling from the trellises. There was a wild look to it all, and even now as I write, I notice the fingers of Kudzu scratching at the base of my windowsill. 

I digress. 

We traversed the dry staircase that led to the front door and went to ring the bell, but the door swung open. I almost jumped, but was immediately disarmed when a small man in a tweed suit greeted us. 

He had a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and wore a slightly crooked and brightly colored bowtie. He sported a thick mustache that put my own to shame and, despite having very recessed pale temples, a thick mane of curly white hair that brushed his shoulders and collar. I expected a staunch and reserved greeting in that similar painful voice the deputy had given us back in town but to my pleasant alarm, he was downright jovial.

“It must be professor Maxwell I see before me!” he exclaimed, clasping my mentor's hand and shaking it vigorously. “I have eagerly awaited your arrival and now here you are! A blessing from… from… Well let's not dive into that. It is too late in the evening to discuss theology. I am Herr Weber-” I was still taking in his charming German accent when he turned to me and looked me up and down. He reminded me of a curious crow as he cocked his head to the side and mused to himself. 

“And who might this be?” he asked, though more to himself than anyone else.

“Johnathan Manuel,” I said, reaching out a hand. “It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

He stared at my hand for a beat, only moving his eyes and his face devoid of a smile. For a moment I was worried I had done something to offend him in some way. I jumped when his straight face burst into a wide laughing grin and he took my hand. His flesh was almost alarmingly rigid and cold, but his personality was anything but. 

“Herr Manuel. The pleasure of acquaintance is all mine. For when I thought I’d only be receiving one guest to this lonesome hill, I’ve been blessed with two! It’s practically a party!”

“Forgive me for the surprise guest, Dr. Weber,” said the professor. “The journey was simply too long to make by myself and I was concerned for my safety. That and- if I may be so bold to say in a company such as this- John is a dear friend despite my advantage in years. I trust him as I do my own family.”

For a moment I thought he almost said brother. 

“There is no apology needed. I agree, the distance is great, but I believe your time here will be worth it. I trust you’ve read my letter?” 

My mentor nodded gravely and his tone seemed to grow tense as he leaned in to speak. “The claims you make are great, and I am desperate. Can you please-”

It was then I embarrassingly let out a wet, hacking cough that resulted in something flying from my mouth. It landed on the floorboards of the front porch, and my cheeks grew red. 

“I’m so sorry-” I told them. “I picked something up on the road, it seems. I cannot begin to-”

“Hush, my boy!” The doctor took me by the shoulder and had me open my mouth. He examined the back of my throat and said, “As I suspected! An allergy attack. The pollen here is extreme most days. Oh, your poor throat must be writhing!” He pointed a finger back to the professor and wagged it at him. “We will discuss further over supper, Maxwell. Believe me when I say that not only are my claims true, but they are greater than you can even imagine. In the meantime, I’ve prepared a stew that I think our young friend will find most agreeable. Please, gentlemen. Inside!”

From there we were led inside the house. I can speak with certainty, now that it is daylight, but at the time I was perplexed with the house. Its interior was Victorian, with old gilded foil flaking off of the molding. There were glass display cases showing knives, pieces of pottery, and papers so old, I thought a mere glance could turn them to dust. The ceiling was high in the main hall, and I saw an open drawing room off to the side with lovely quilted armchairs. The walls were lined with books, which set my mind spinning with excitement. There was also a strange towering device made of glass and metal in the center of the table, but I did not recognize what it was. 

“This way, gentlemen,” he said, leading us to a door on the left. “I have much to discuss with you, and plenty of food for you to eat. Please!” 

As we entered the dining room, he gestured us to a set of chairs nestled into a fine mahogany table. In the center of its face, resting on a linen runner, there was a large silver dome covering a platter. From a china cabinet behind us, he nabbed another plate and bowl, along with an extra spoon. He sat them down in front of me with care.

“Gentlemen,” he said, gripping the top of the dome. “I give you a stew that will change your lives forever.” The professor laughed, but the doctor did not. I suppressed a cough, but Weber did not seem to notice as he turned to my mentor with a voracious eye. I half expected a reprimand, but instead:	“What ails you, Professor Maxwell?” The professor looked confused by the issue. “I say, what ails you? What causes you pain?”

“I’m afraid I don’t understand, Dr. Weber.”

“It is a simple enough question,” he said, brushing his mustache with a stubby hand. “Our young friend here, at the present, suffers from pains in the throat with no ready medicine for his condition. Therefore, I ask you, what is it that ails you?”

“Nothing in particular, sir.” At that, he flashed me a look of concern and amusement, almost as if he’d been stopped in the street by a crazed beggar. 

“We are all afflicted,” said the doctor. “Whether we admit it or not.”

“But I have no wounds!” 

There was a long stare between the two of them. The only movement in the room was the flickering of the candelabras and the trembling of a vase of tulips. Then, with an almost sinister flare, the doctor smiled. “Not all afflictions can be seen, and not all pains are wounds. Think of this as you eat, Herr Maxwell.”

He removed the cover and revealed a large bowl of amber stew, full of carrots, corn, potatoes and meat I believe was beef. He used a small ladle and filled our bowls, then exited the room briefly, leaving us alone with our food. Up close, it looked odd to me. Oil floated in the broth, and the vegetables looked as if they’d been submerged for a long while. It looked almost mushy when looking at it too long. I looked up to see the professor's reaction, but to my alarm he was staring at the bowl, wide eyed and troubled. 

Dr. Weber appeared with a  bottle of red wine, and exclaimed, “Multipulciano!” He had already uncorked the bottle and was generously filling our glasses as we sat. “I fell in love with this wine while studying in Italy. I bought enough to last a lifetime- though I hope I outlive the wine!” He laughed heartily, but by himself. Once he sat down, he gestured for us to eat, and reluctantly we did. 

I am astonished at how nervous I was at the time. I was merely eating soup, and yet I recall my hand trembling as I raised the spoon to my lips. Those first few seconds of taste were nonexistent as I slurped down the broth, but my senses were reawakened as I took in a flavor that reminded me of a soup from my childhood. My mother made a soup that tasted exactly like this, down to the spices she’d thrown in sometimes at random, but always tasting lovely. 

There was no doubt, despite my odd circumstances. This was my mother’s stew. How that could be, I had no idea, but it was. The only odd thing I found was that it was devoid of salt. For moments I would think that there was a hint somewhere, but for some reason I could tell there wasn’t. I looked up to ask the professor, expecting to interrupt his meal, but he was actually watching us. His bowl was as full as his smile, and he raised his eyebrows in delight as I asked him for a salt shaker. 

“Apologies,” he said, raising both hands in surrender, “but I’m afraid I don’t keep salt in the house. Sodium doesn’t like me, you understand.”  

I almost made a comment about how odd that was, and turned to see my professor's reaction, but he wasn’t listening. Instead, he was crying softly, his bearded face inches from the bowl. I saw a tear roll of his nose and drop into the soup.

“Professor Maxwell,” I asked, “are you okay?” 

“Of course he is,” answered the Doctor as he learned back in his carved chair. “He’s simply healing. Aren’t you, sir?” He looked up with a red face of astonishment. His wet cheeks were wiped by the sleeve of his jacket, and his smile was like that of a terminally ill man being told he was cured. 

“I don’t understand,” he said. “What is this doing to me?”

“I’d like to know the same!” I interjected, “This stew tastes… I mean it’s just like the one-”

“How is your throat, my young friend?” 

It was then I realized my throat was no longer in pain. I inhaled an incredulous breath and was shocked at the clarity of my throat. I couldn’t even muster a response before the Doctor interrupted again. 

“I imagine your neck must feel better too.” 

He was right about that as well. Any pains and aches from travel I held had vanished from my body. I was relaxed, somehow, and my muscles were invigorated. As I write this now, I find myself wondering:

Did I ever mention the pain in my neck?

If I did, I would have forgotten it. For now, I’ll chock up Weber’s comment to nothing more than observation. Still….

Without elaborating, the doctor stood to his feet and said, “My friends, please finish eating. I have a surprise in the drawing room for when you finish, but for now, eat. Eat, and be healed! There is still much to discuss before bed.”

And with that, he left us and we were left alone. I stared at my bowl for a second, trying to rationalize the flavors I tasted with what I saw, but was unsuccessful. I looked at Maxwell to find some kindred spirit, but it was useless. He was already pouring himself another bowl.",2,1765158817.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone. I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’ve never really posted here before, but I’m trying to branch out and meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some simple, genuine connections.

A little about me:
I’m big into anything outdoors when the weather’s good like  hiking, kayaking, camping, all that good stuff. Once winter hits though, I fully switch into homebody mode. Give me reading, good coffee, TV show binges, and warm cuddles with the right person and I’m set.

I’m a friendly, laid back guy who can get pretty goofy once I’m comfortable. I love sarcasm and I’m always down for good conversation, whether it’s light, funny, or deeper “talk for hours” type stuff.

If you’re looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share random thoughts with, or just build a chill friendship, feel free to message me.

I really had a fun time making this. I caused me to to use a software (Ableton) I had been taught in college in a professional like manner. I think I did ok. I also hope a lot comes out of this though. I see a lot of stories, art, edits coming out of the Dispatch Fandom but I don't think I have ever seen someone make a concept soundtrack. Maybe in other fandoms but not in this one yet. With that, I am so happy that I might be the first.   
  
I am also really happy to see what you guys think about these tracks. What could you pull together? Though the titles of each song can give away what the scene is doing, it can also be misleading. That is to say a few of these titles are not what you think. Ha! So please tell me your thoughts. I am also contemplating on doing a part 2.

He gives mixed signals and I don’t know how to read him.,"I (19F) have a crush on a coworker (23/24M) who’s now my manager. He gives mixed signals and I don’t know how to read him.
Post:
So I (19F) have known this guy at work for about 3 years — we actually knew each other before he became a manager. We both work at McDonald’s, and he’s been a manager for around 3–4 years now. I’ve had a crush on him for a while, but the problem is that he gives me very mixed signals and I can’t tell if he likes me or if I’m imagining things.
Some examples:
• He teases me a LOT, way more than other coworkers.
• He defends me when someone talks badly about me.
• He once drove me home when I had no car.
• He brought his expensive perfume to work because I told him to (as a joke).
• He joked that if he guessed my perfume, I’d have to stop talking (he doesn’t make jokes like that with others).
• A coworker texted him asking if there’s a girl he likes, and he said “I already know who,” but he never says anything else.
• He also teases me with another coworker (saying that guy thinks I’m cute), but I don’t know if he’s joking to hide his own feelings.
• When he came back from a football trip to Milan, I joked “without me?” and he told me I should buy a plane ticket next time if I want to come.
• He sometimes acts more friendly/chill with me when fewer coworkers are around.
BUT he also said once that he doesn’t want a relationship anymore because of a bad breakup.
So I’m confused. Sometimes he acts like he likes me, sometimes not. Sometimes he does the same jokes with guys, so I don’t know if it means anything or if it’s just his personality.
I’m going to Milan soon, and I’m thinking of asking him something casual like:
“What do you think about hanging out before I leave? Just something chill like coffee.”
But I don’t want things to be awkward at work if he doesn’t feel the same. I usually get nervous and forget everything when I’m around him.

Several sitz baths per day, including during & after BMs.  Staying hydrated, drinking morning coffee, drinking apple juice, eating soft vegan diet, pureed when possible.

With all BMs, I can't tell when I'm finished. It still feels like there's pressure down there and more poop is coming.

2. When, WHEN, will the pain start to subside?

1pgzqah,https://www.reddit.com/r/dystopia/comments/1pgzqah/im_officially_the_ceo_of_toys_r_nice/,I’m officially the CEO of Toys R Nice.,"I always knew I’d take over the company one day.

Now it makes sense why Dad was so tired after work.

Sometimes the toys have to hurt if they want to help.

# Update I

Dad always told me if you’re not making money, you’re not winning.

That’s why our wall at home is covered in his awards.

The metal is so shiny I sometimes have to put a blanket over them when I’m watching TV.

**“Exceptional Third Quarter 119 NO”**  
**“Highest Contributor 117 NO”**

His Commission plaques go on and on.

Dad always said my name would be on one someday, if I work hard enough.

I wasn’t nervous my first day. I’d be shadowing Dad a whole year before he retires.

I never realized how far the factory is.

It was the same routine as usual. A high-end MAST vehicle picked us up. Dad did some work while I just drifted.

I swear the whole factory lit up as soon as the vehicle got close. The door flung open, everything sprang to life, and we entered.

I noticed the gardening around the front fountain was much nicer than when I was a kid.

The grand metallic doors always open for us as soon as we get close—inviting us in.

I swear one time the fountain in the lobby turned on exactly when we walked through. Dad didn’t react, so I didn’t either.

The only human in the lobby is a secretary. I still don’t think I’ve ever caught her name.

The admin-only sections are usually dead quiet. Dad always says, *“If they can’t send you a message, they aren’t worth talking to.”*

As soon as we walked in, an Ali brought Dad his usual coffee. I’ve always wondered what blend he drinks because he seems to perk up around 10 A.M.

The first time, I was shocked by just how efficient the assembly line was.

A mess of metal, arms, belts, lasers, chains—stacked on top of each other.

These machines can do anything: bending, melting, crimping, micro-welding, die-pressing, spitting resin, etching, micro-lathing—a million other things I don’t understand.

I’m not sure if Dad understands them either, or if they’re some weird left-behind relic.

We entered the production facility for: **H4NNAH™**.

I never played with dolls, but I see why **H4NNAH™** is a best seller.

**H4NNAH™** can generate warmth to soothe a child and entertain through conversation and simple movement.

**H4NNAH™** also provides parents security with a built-in camera and threat detector.

Kids with a **H4NNAH™** have been known to learn numbers and letters as early as one year old.

**H4NNAH™** supports independence for the busy parent and learns the best way to soothe your child.

Way beyond my nanny from childhood.

It’s a product Dad and I are really proud of.

Once the tour was done, Dad’s smirk faded.

**“After lunch, I’ll show you Building Two,”** he said.

Connected by a hundred-meter hallway—sealed off with a state-of-the-art purification tunnel—is Building Two.

You have to wear a respirator and full protective suit there.

Worse than inhaling the chemicals is the smell of the workers.

Dirty, lifeless people—we learned about the Drys in school. Worthless, uneducated.

That was my first time seeing one up close.

Dad told me one once tried to drink the hot pumping water. Burned their whole throat and died.

I asked why anyone would do that.

Dad just laughed and said, *“Because they’re Drys.”*

We entered the production facility for: **Filter Fun — by Good Water™.**

Dad says it’s important to start them young.

This sippy-cup style water filter is perfect for children who care about water preservation.

It can turn almost any liquid into delicious Good Water™!

Dad told me the list of liquids it can convert.  
It was… shocking.

Kids love learning how to clean their own water.

Dad says we are vertically integrated with Good Water™. Basically it means we make massive profits on these things.

The scale of production was incredible. Hundreds left the line in a minute in a hot frenzy of human labor—smoke, sparks, noise and chaos.

The Drys don’t care about the smoke, the burns, the chemicals, nothing. If they did, they wouldn’t work here.

Their arms are dyed with the colors they work with.

Sometimes they just stop showing up.

We get a new one the next day.

The profit is amazing.

Dad says the more we contribute to the Commission, the better the life we can live and the more connections we can make.

Everything is top of the line: our tech, our pharmaceuticals, our food, our MASTs, our lives.

It’s been a great first week.

**Update II**

Dad told me 98% of our products are sold to Drys. I was shocked at first, but I guess it makes sense.

He says, **“There are rules to the game.”**  
**“One Building One toy sells for ten-thousand times a Building Two toy.”**  
**“It’s all about scale.”**  
**“But the most important thing is: we give the customer what they need, not what they want.”**

I think I finally understood when we worked on our first toy development.

Dad said the Commission liked the product, so we were going to make it happen.

It’s a Building Two toy: a round, colorful, cute-faced stuffed animal. Most importantly, they wanted it extremely fluffy.

The fluff needed a specific formulation.

We found a pharmaceutical company that could provide it:

**Azeoticomazine**

I had no idea what it does, but a simple scroll and I did.

**“Human hormone and fertilization suppression.”**

Dad says the Commission always has its eyes on the greater good.

I’m not a Dry, so who am I to judge?

Even though most of the plans were generated, it was cool to see the new machine set.

I always thought the prototypes were cute, even though I stay far away—even in my suit.

I asked Dad why we don’t create many new Building One toys. He said the ones we already have are best-sellers, so it’s more profitable to release new versions.

Dad wanted to make sure that before he retires, I’m running things independently, so I’ve been taking on my own projects.

For my first project, the Commission wanted something very specific:

**“Drive thirst and water sales.”**

Their requests always make sense. A bit of creativity and consultation and we always come up with a top seller. It’s in our bloodline.

I pondered and asked Mack about it. I looked up some past projects, and what I came up with I’m pretty proud of for my first creation.

# Fun-Yum Shaker™

Little ones love to shake, listen, and mouth on the Fun-Yum Shaker.

The metallic balls make the signature sound every child loves—multiple colors available.

A small shaker for young kids with jingle bells inside that has a salty-butter flavor.

Test groups drank 44% more compared to placebo—I think the Commission knew I was on to something.

The secret is the butter, salted coating. Drives kids wild. Not just kids—we had to fire a Dry because they were licking it.

Dad and I couldn’t stop laughing in disgust.

I chose the best materials—obviously the cheapest.

Mercury oxide had the best sound for the balls. The best swoosh.

The rest was just our usual hard-shell plastic and radiant dyes.

The coating wasn’t easy to find. I think Happy Pharma helped with the formulation.

One day Dad called me into his office. **“Not bad,”** he said as he used his inhaler. **“But not enough sales.”**

He was right. The sales volume was not even close to Filter Fun — by Good Water™.

I sulked for a couple days, but he’s right. The toys really need to pull the Drys in.

So the Commission wanted to increase violence, and it was the perfect time to make something Drys really understand:

# A pistol.

**Have you ever wanted to hold Daddy’s gun?**

**Peter the Pistol™** feels just like the real thing.

Feel the real pop, the flash, the smoke—use your imagination.

With fun reloadable cartridges and non-penetrating ammunition.

It was my first huge success. Sales even exceeded Filter Fun — by Good Water™ for a month.

The Commission wants us to release special ammo and accessories for it next quarter.

I think Dad knows I’ve got things handled now. I think I’m ready too—but I’m glad I have one more month before he retires to Paradise.

# Update III

I have my own plaques now where Dad’s used to be.  
No offense to him, but the numbers say I’m doing better—and he always said the numbers don't lie.

The most important thing in business is moving fast.   
Fast decisions, fast people, fast machines—even if that means turning the heat all the way up.

I was in my office the other day and heard scratching at the door. When I opened it, I saw a **H4NNAH™** bot— a new prototype. Impressive. I’m glad I put together such good R&D.

I dragged it back to the facility, found the security guard who was supposed to be working, and fired them. The incompetent are always replaceable.

My last few products have been killing it—the Commission loved the concepts and the profits.

It’s been a lot easier now that the directive has been the same:

**“Reduce population.”**

A pretty simple thing to do, really.

# Crackle Rocks™

Crackle Rocks are fun magnetic rocks that BOOM, CRACK, and SPARK when you throw them together.

You can even choose the color of your smoke and sparks.

It’s so fun to throw them up and watch them go BOOM!

Now in strawberry, chocolate, orange, and vanilla scents.

Our secret was the smoke and spark. The compound list said it’s nicotine, taurine, caffeine, and some longer “-ine” ending molecules.

Those are pretty addictive, so that’s how we hook them.

Then they beg their parents for the new scented ones—of course they have to buy them.

And **the scent is what the Commission loved.**

Research said the compound reduces longevity.

Once the smell fades and the smoke weakens, studies show **60% repeat buyers.**

Crackle Rocks are still one of our best products to this day.

One of the security guards told me there was a suspected theft. Medicine, I think.

I called in the Company—told them not to go easy on them.  
Scum like that should know not to apply.

# Keeper-Up Fun™

Such a simple toy—and that’s why it’s brilliant.

It’s so much fun trying to see how many times you can hit the ball.  
Challenge your friends, challenge yourself—be a champion.

It’s just a paddle with a string attached to a ball—cheap as hell to make.

We were able to keep the price low.  
Even the poorest Drys were buying them.

The secret is the material: cheap, weak metal that breaks into small, sharp shards.

Accidents went through the roof.  
There were even fatal infections.

I’m glad I can just do my part.

Things were great until last week.

One of our suppliers invited me to his daughter’s birthday. She opened a present and—somehow—she was holding a Keeper-Up Fun.

My heart dropped. I panicked and grabbed it too fast.  
It shattered. Kids got cut. Blood everywhere. I apologized and left.

The next morning I ran to work and watched the packing footage.  
She was trying to ruin me.

I told her to bring a Keeper-Up Fun to my office for testing.  
She sat down.

That sick feeling wouldn’t leave: the blood, the embarrassment.

I swung it over her head.  
Metal, blood, shards everywhere.

I walked out and told security to deal with it.

Now I keep thinking about the CEO whose daughter I… inconvenienced.  
If he tells the Commission, he could cut off our medicine supply, ruin our production, destabilize the Company.

I wish I could ask Dad what he’d do.

The last formula from our pharma partner was overpriced and tanked a product. No one else can make it. Our profits have dropped 10% for three quarters.

The metals on the wall laugh at me. I never deserved them.

If I can’t cut costs, they’ll cut me.

**The Commission requested a meeting.**

On top of your normal doodle anxieties, I believe some major anxiety is from his past.
We had issues with him ingesting toys and tennis balls like whole, one bite, and have had induced vomits and a full on stomach surgery before, so we are careful with what toys we give him as he is a major destroyer.
When we leave napkins on our dining table or a box of tissues on the coffee table and when we leave home, he will rip them to shreds—but to me in a sense I’ve seen a million dogs do that.
He also eats grass when over aroused when people pet him so that he doesn’t jump on them.
Recently, he’s been eating SO much grass just from sniffing it. Like major ass chunks.
Additionally, now when we leave (since we don’t leave any tissues or napkins out) he’s gotten our mail from the table and ripped that up….i mean we’ve had mail on our table for years and it’s never been a problem until now.
Tonight, we came home to the border of our puzzle we started completely gone.
We feed him Zignature Turkey and organic frozen green beans daily with fish oil and he gets  20mg of Prozac a day. We feed him in puzzle bowls and a Kong Wobbler.
I think he’s pissed we’re leaving him? Is it bc we’re slightly less active (not by too much) because it’s dark and cold and we aren’t out as much as the summer warm months?
Do I try a probiotic? A food change?
I can’t afford fresh food for how much he eats daily and the BalanceIt supplement my vet recommended is like an insane cost for his potential allergy sensitivities I got from a holistic test.
I really don’t want to muzzle him.
Like really don’t want to.
I also don’t want to up his meds.
Obviously I need to not have anything that he can get out but it’s just so weird he’s going after new stuff.

1pgzovo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pgzovo/i_had_trouble_sleeping_when_i_was_younger_last/,"I had trouble sleeping when I was younger, last night I found out why","It started when I was 8 years old. At the time, I had begun to have these “jolts” from my sleep. Some point near midnight, I would suddenly be thrown awake, it was like those moments in which you would just be about to sleep, but your body suddenly acts like you are falling, only these jolts would cause me to feel like I was being thrown into the air. My parents at first chalked it up to insomnia, school at the time was stressful for me with all sorts of new classes and information being taught, so I don’t blame them for thinking that at first. However, the jolts were very rare at first, but over time, began to happen every night, and slowly, I would wake up with more panic, screaming and throwing punches at a threat which wasn’t present. 5 days after these more aggravated jolts began, my parents began to think that insomnia was less likely, they began to ask if I had problems at school, things like bullies or mean teachers. I hadn’t really had any bullies at the time, and all the teachers were nice, so the answer was always no. They took me to a few checkups with the local child’s clinic, they found nothing physically wrong, but they noted that I had much more “self-inflicted trauma” whatever the hell that was supposed to mean. They gave my parents a prescription for sleeping pills and suggested that I take one an hour before bed, hopefully to keep me asleep. These pills never worked at all. While I did feel more drowsy before bed, it never stopped the jolts from happening, and they continued to happen every time, at midnight. 



This went on for a while and I just wanted the horror to end, I eventually asked my parents if there was a “Sleep doctor” they told me that while there was no such thing as a “Sleep doctor” they could have me visit a psychiatrist. Soon enough, I was sitting in an office with several toys, fidgets and books scattered about, as Dr. Cole, my psychiatrist at the time, proceeded to ask me several questions. They were ridiculously simple, with questions such as “How old are you? Have you always felt like seeking psychiatric help? Do you sleep well? Do you eat healthy?” and so on. Then after those questions, he took out several papers, the ones with splotches on them to see how the patient's mind works on identifying it. I swear to god, every single one of those papers had 2 large, pitch black circles on either side, so dark it felt like I could stick my hand in and lose it forever. I know that some of them may have had features similar to that, but for me, each one had the exact same spots, empty voids that seemed to stare directly into me. On about the 9th paper, I burst into tears and tried to cower under the desk, as Dr. Cole re-stacked the papers, slid them into a folder, and began to fill out a report. Later that day, my parents were told that I could have a case of mild schizophrenia, where my brain forced images I didn’t want to see onto the paper. My parents were once again given a prescription for me. My father made a fuss, objecting to having his youngest son take pills for a real medical disorder, rather than having it treated, safe to say, I didn’t go back there again.



For months, I had to deal with these jolts, all the damn time, and it got so bad that I stopped sleeping in my room anymore, and just decided to sleep with my brother David. David was 10 at the time and honestly, he didn’t want to have to put up with my shit anymore, but he still let me sleep with him if it got me to shut up. After some time, my birthday came up, the party was supposed to be an excuse for me to get outside time, but with my midnight jolts, my parents decided to let us all stay inside and bond together more. At the party were 3 of my closest friends, two of which I was neighbors with, the last one being a classmate. Along with my friends were two of my cousins, who were at least 5 years older than my brother, but still enjoyed coming over to hang out with us from time to time. During the party, I somehow managed to forget about the jolts, as everyone played games, talked about upcoming events and most importantly, laughed at absurdly basic jokes. In the evening, my brother and I grabbed out our sleeping bags. Then David went to set up the pullout bed from the couch, while I collected blankets and pillows. David stood in front of everyone and told them the sleeping bags were for me and him only, and that the couch-bed would be up for claim, then I smirked as I told them to “Duke it out for the bed”, I had expected a thumb war or a game of rock paper scissors, but instead, our cousins volunteered to sleep on the floor, while my friends arm wrestled for the couch-bed. After deciding the bedding arrangements, we stayed up for a good 2 hours after normal bed time, daring each other to try staying awake longer than the other. Of course, I was the last to fall asleep



As I drifted off, I smiled from the whole day of fun, despite only really staying inside and laughing until we couldn’t breathe. Then, about midnight, I could feel myself being thrown up out of sleep, and the urge to scream and lash out at the closest thing flew by, but my voice, I couldn’t scream, my mouth was open and yet my vocal chords refused to open up. My arms, already in the sleeping bag, didn’t move. I remembered my cousin saying he had moments like this often, sleep paralysis, where you wake up too quickly for your body to register it and unlock your movements. I scanned the room to see if anyone was around, the only things I saw was the mess of board games and snacks, my brother, cousins, and friends asleep, and the large window to the side of the front door. My cousin had always told me that in his paralyzed state, he would always try to keep looking at different things since he knew that the mind would eventually get bored and try to create things like monsters, my brother told him that looking around would encourage the mind to create the demons, my cousin just shrugged and told him that he never saw anything that wasn’t there before. I kept looking at every part of the room I could to make sure nothing changed. When I was satisfied, I closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep. Then, shortly after closing my eyes, there was a rustling sound in the bush right outside the large window, my eyes shot open and I turned to see what it was, I was horrified. 



The man, thing rather, standing outside my window was tall and dark, he seemed to be wearing a black hoodie of sorts, but his face, I could never forget it, a dark, yet pale face, no discernable mouth or nose, and the eyes, they were exactly like the large dots I saw on the paper in Dr. Cole’s office, but they seemed more hollow. Somehow, I managed to scrunch my face up into a scowl, hoping that he would see my anger and leave. He did in fact see the scowl, and turned toward the door, and walked to it, I blinked just to make sure I wasn’t seeing things, but the thing, he was now standing inside of my home, just in front of the window, terrified of blinking, I forced my eyes to stay open. The thing started to walk closer, slowly, my eyes watered and I fought as hard as I could against the urge to blink, until suddenly, I did. When my eyes opened up, the thing was gone, scanning the room, nothing was out of the ordinary. I realized that my body was unlocked from paralysis and I rushed to my brother to wake him up.



“David! David!” I shouted, “There’s a man, I saw him! He’s hiding in our house!” My brother stirred and turned over from me. “Come on David! We need to wake up mom and dad!”



“It’s late dude, go back to sleep.” My brother groaned.



“No! I can’t sleep, David! He’s in our home! He could be waiting to kill us!” I shouted back.



David slowly got up, stretched his arms and said in a yawn “How about we look for this man and if we find him, we can go get mom and dad. Deal?” I nodded. David got up and we began to look around in the living room, under the couch-bed, under the coffee table, and we even checked the hallway closet, there was nothing. We went back to bed and David almost instantly fell asleep, I knew what I saw, I knew it. My jolts after that night stopped, I never knew why, so for a while, I just thought I was going through a fear phase where I was afraid of everything. I’m currently 19 years old and last night, I was proven wrong, when I experienced a jolt, and outside my window, was the man with no eyes.

1pgzgat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1pgzgat/met_my_zepnemesis/,Met My Zep-Nemesis!,"Well, I finally met my Zep-nemesis! 

For nine months, I’ve felt very lucky, as I could eat pretty much everything that appealed to me without feeling like it had turned to lead in my stomach. 

Filet mignon in a brandy peppercorn cream sauce? No biggie. Just ate until I was satisfied and had the rest as a leftover. 

Thanksgiving potato casserole? Yum yes please. 

Indian food? Mexican food? Sure, on occasion! 

But yesterday I met my Zep-nemesis! 

I met friends in Manhattan and we had planned to eat lunch at the Bryant Park holiday market pop up.  

One friend scored a table with sufficient chairs while we were waiting in line: amazing! 

Another suggested she and I split a truffle cheesesteak. “Half a cheesesteak?” I said, “That sounds perfect!” 

As it turned out, it was perfect—a perfect lead lump in my belly for the better part of 24 hours! 

I first noticed it wasn’t moving on when we were leaving a store on the Upper West Side at dinner time. It was time to suggest dinner or head home, and since my belly was still entirely full of lunchtime truffle cheesesteak, heading home was the only viable option. 

Two hours — and a subway, train, and car ride later — I was home, and Truffy McCheesie was still weighing down my belly. I drank a LOT of evening water (I’m sure lack of normal hydration while running around the city was part of the problem) and despite my still full belly, I was able to fall asleep a couple of hours later at a normal-ish time. 

This morning I woke up early as I had a work thing to dress for and go to, and for the first time in years, there was no way I was eating my usual avocado toast and egg breakfast. A protein shake, water bottle, and cup of coffee later, I was off. They served food at the thing, but I stuck to water. Food still wasn’t appealing.

As I drove home, I decided it would be easier to run an errand I needed to run today or tomorrow today. I had to brave the Hunger Games Arena-vibe of a mall at holiday time, but I decided to face it today rather than during my very busy work week. 

Somehow, walking the mall encouraged things to finally get moving. So when I finally got home around 2:30 pm, I had finally — 24 hours later — said goodbye to my Truffly Buddy. And I was able to eat breakfast. Yay! (And I did have a normal dinner tonight, so I am back on track.) 

All that said, MAN WAS THAT CHEESESTEAK YUMMY GOING down!

And these guys are trying to sell me an extended warranty like it’s a 2009 BMW.

It’s an F-150.
It runs on coffee, disrespect, and aluminum panels held together by pure confidence.

The only thing that’ll break on it is… nothing. You think Ford would put a V8 in a truck and then expect it to fail? Bro, that engine will outlive me, you, and probably the dealership’s sales manager.

Extended warranty? For what?

But they leave the part out that if you like anything slightly obscure people are just gonna think you're a freak matter how confident you are. 

I'm 19 right now, in college and I've been trying to work on my confidence. Yet I've realized that nothing I do matters. My family won't listen to me, stickers think I'm wired, my friend entertain my idea less and less, my sibling think I'm weird. I can't win.

I like writing, drawing, dinosaurs and, Nintendo games. If I had to pick 4 things those would be it, so I'll just go form the list and explain why nobody cares/thinks they're weird. 

1: drawing. It's a party trick at best. It doesn't matter that my major is 2d animation, it doesn't matter that I'm hired as graphic designer twice over. It's never impressive beyond ""oh wow cool"".

2: writing. Nobody cares about what anybody writes. It doesn't matter of you poured hours into your work, nobody's gonna care or want to read it, I'm the same way, but it's just the facts. I was in a coffee shop on campus with an audio series and anytime I looked up there were people glaring at me for no reason. 

3: dinosaurs. Anytime I mention I like dinosaurs, people immediately go ""oh so you're autistic?"". I'm not. That gets me so fucking upset. I get it it's a stereotype, but on my fucking God, liking dinosaurs doesn't meant your neurodivergent! It just means you like dinosaurs. I was over on a date where I was telling a girl that around Christmas time, I like to draw something each day like an advent calander, and that I was currently drawing gingerbread dinosaurs. She's goes ""oh...wow..."" And then never brought it up again. My older sister thinks I'm stupid because I but downstairs toys sometimes. She's said right to my face ""why would you spend your money on that?"" And do many people act the same way. 

4: Nintendo games. Yet another thing where people immediately assume something about you. But this time, I'm a corporate slave. Just because I like a game company more than others shouldn't make me a slave to the corporations. It's like people think their better than you because they play different games. I don't care what games you play, but if a game comes out that looks good, I'm buying it, I don't care who made it. If Nintendo makes a game where you okay as a monkey and break stuff, I'm buying it because it looks fun. Yet especially nowadays with the switch 2 debobicle, people go ""you're really gonna spend $70 on a video game!?"" Yes I am, because I work and I feel money and it looks fun. 

So my genuine question is, if the things I like the most and have fun with and be happy with, are hated and so quickly assumed by people, what do I do?

I'm not gonna change who I am. Yet nobody even gives you the chance.
