Now I feel like an option.,"We dated for six months. In the beginning, it was exciting—we fell in love quickly and became exclusive almost right away. We even took a short trip abroad together.

But on the second-to-last day of that trip, I noticed he still had dating apps on his phone. It overwhelmed me. I needed some space to process how I felt, so I told him. Instead of understanding, he said I was ruining the trip and that I didn’t trust him. He claimed he wasn’t using the apps and made me feel like I had no right to be upset. We eventually made up, but that moment left a mark.

Throughout our relationship, there were small issues and some big fights, but nothing hit as hard as this recent one. He broke up with me over text. I didn’t chase him—I let it be. It hurt, but life moves on.

A week later, I felt a little better and decided to check in on him. We had a long phone call, over an hour, and agreed to meet the next day. We had a good time, like old times. But then I saw a dating app on his phone again. I confronted him and asked him to delete it. He refused.

At that point, I realized he was probably talking to someone else. He admitted he had gone on a date the day before I called. His response was, “I’m not breaking any rules.”  It was just a coffee date. That hit hard.

Suddenly, everything felt different. We clearly have strong feelings for each other, but our communication has been damaging. I was ready to let go, but after seeing him again, part of me hoped we could fix things. He seemed genuinely happy to see me too, and for a moment, it felt like we were back to how things used to be.

But knowing that he’s already meeting other people so soon after our breakup really bothers me. Yes, technically we’re not together anymore, but still. It made me feel like I’m just filling a space in his life, someone easily replaced. And by reaching out first, I made myself an easy option. I get that I could meet new people too, but I’m not ready for that. Not after just a week.

I don’t know. I still really like him, and I’ve told him how I feel, but I don’t know how to move past this. But he didn’t even deny it when I said I thought he found her attractive. He told me that he will cut tie with the new date. I'd rather not because it's way easier to move on with that. I think about this all the time and I don't think about it. 

Maybe I shouldn’t have made that call. They were right, don't reach out.",1,1744992595.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I bought fresh (pre ground) beans from a local roaster and the shots I’m pulling are beyond sour/completely not drinkable. The beans say roasted on April 16 and 17.

I measured out 15/16 grams of coffee as per the instructions, put in the pressurized basket, used the wdt tool, tamp it, put a screen on, and then pressed the double shot button. The first attempt came out in about 20 seconds and the second in about 10. First time it started coming only from one side then the second started, second attempt really only came from one side and was incredibly watery. And so so sour!

I’m looking for any advice/guidance on how I can get a decent espresso shot from my machine! I recognize I haven’t tried for very long but just feeling discouraged already and you all have been so helpful!

Is it worth buying cheaper pre ground beans and trying to figure it out with those?

I slowly started trusting him again. I actually allowed myself to feel hope and love again. Then one morning I heard a noise behind the stove, I recorded it and waited for him to wake up so I can show him. He did and he had his coffee, he’s inhumane before coffee, so I avoid him. I went to him, and showed him the sound. I said I think I bearded a mouse. I played the sound for him he listened and said that’s not a mouse. I said are you sure cause…. he cut me off and got mad. Then he said in his most vile tone ever. One you would use on a stray dog stealing your baby’s food out of her hand. He said “ Go away!” and threw his hand up in disgust. I said you can’t talk to me like that. He got even more mad and started arguing that it wasnt a mouse. I said fine it isn’t. and walked away. I felt so stupid for trusting him again with my feelings, I let my guard down and showed him the real me. The me he swears he loves. That night when I went to bed beside him I couldn’t sleep. I felt dumb, like a stupid little unwanted ugly kid nobody loves next to him. I told him this and he apologized and said he didn’t mean it that way, that he handled it wrong. He said not to feel that way and that’s not how he sees me. I cried in front of him and felt even more stupid. I havent been able to forgive him, the insult and scar runs deep.

Im back to sleeping in a separate room and not trying to spend time with him. I don’t know what to do . On one hand it’s a minor thing, on the other it hurt so bad. Im at a loss on what to do. Somedays I forget and somedays I can’t be around him out of embarrassment for being me and being made to feel stupid for it. Even though he said he missed the old me, the one he loved before, the happy girl who was always excited to see him and share little things with him.

1k28ji0,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1k28ji0/i_thought_i_was_just_grabbing_a_cup_of_coffee/,I thought I was just grabbing a cup of coffee...,"I was out on the street trying to get my migration certificate from my university. It was hot, crowded, and mentally exhausting. On a whim, I decided to stop by this old coffee place nearby. It’s got this really cool, pre-colonial vibe—like, it feels like you’ve time-traveled. But it’s also in this super congested area where even cabs and bikes have a hard time entering. Even people who know the place get confused in those lanes.
I ordered a cup of coffee, took a stall, chilled for a bit. All good so far.
After finishing, I started walking down the narrow staircase while booking a moto to head back. Just then, I got a random text from this old acquaintance (different story for another time). The message triggered this weird anxiety wave, like the kind where your whole body suddenly feels off. While I was distracted, I missed a step and badly twisted my ankle.
Now for context—I’ve sprained my ankle many times before, always my right one. But this time it was the left. Sharp pain instantly shot up my leg. I sat down right there on the stairs. Next to me was one of those heavy old-school metal door stoppers, around 1.5–2 ft tall. Just this big chunk of iron history. And I was just... stuck.
My moto driver called, saying he’d reached the main road. I thought I could maybe walk up to him. So I tried to get up... and boom—my whole body switched modes. I don’t even know how to explain it properly, but it was like this full-blown system crash. My stomach dropped, my head felt weirdly light and disconnected, and I started trembling—like actual, visible trembling. Sweat started dripping down my face like I’d just done a full HIIT workout. I couldn’t even balance. I had to sit back down immediately. That’s when it hit me: I might actually faint right here.
Called the moto guy and told him I won’t be able to make it—he should cancel. I could barely speak properly through the call.
Then I started panic-booking cabs from every app I had. None came fast. I was sitting there for 30+ minutes, alone, ankle hurting, vision fuzzy, head spiraling. Whichever one could come fastest. But none of them arrived quickly—30+ minutes passed. 
And then came the thoughts:
“Maybe I’ll die here. I might not be able handle myself, I will fall and hit my head on this metal stopper. Cause of death: over-bleeding. My parents will never know where I was. My stuff’s gonna get stolen.”
And the weirdest part? A huge piece of me was kind of actually happy with it. Except for one thing:
I wanted to return the phone, EarPods my father gifted me and his helmet. I just wanted to return them before anything happens to me. 
One cab reached. The driver actually came near the café, helped me get in, and the moment I sat down inside the cab, the dizziness started to fade. It still hurt like hell, but at least I was on my way home.
Not sure why I’m writing this. Just had to get it off my chest.

I'm curious if we feel that way for the same reasons. Here's my list. In some paltry effort at positivity, I'll add my list of pros. 

1. Too many pots boiling all at once. Everything is important and I can only move so much forward each day. 
2. No one really *wants* my services, they just *need* them.  
3. No real sense of purpose doing the same thing for different people (who mostly fit into #2).
4. My Inbox. It never stops. And if I'm emailing, the real work sits.
5. Constant conflict with OC/parties and one-sided perspectives.
6. The second I stop working the money stops (or drops)...hard to leverage or unplug.

OK, there are some good things:

1. The money is better than a lot of gigs. 
2. I sit at a comfortable desk, mostly from home, with a coffee to make that money.
3. As my wife says, the job immediately tells people something about you and is typically respected.
4. The demands are relentless but I mostly control my schedule.

Bit of a long winded story but to summarise:

I met a new woman at work and we got paired up so we started working together everyday. I knew from the start she was with someone else so never gave any thought to it even though I found her attractive. Eventually we started to become friendly at times and she would disclose to me how unhappy she was with her current partner. Eventually she started saying things like “you should come to the gym with me” or “you should come round to my house for a coffee”. Again, knowing she was with someone I brushed off these offers but started noting how close we were becoming. 

Then by chance we swapped numbers and started messaging, innocent messages but still the contact was there. It then became fairly clear how friendly we were becoming and on a work night out she kissed me out of the blue. 

I felt absolutely horrendous about the kiss, mainly felt bad for her partner. Back at work we discussed the kiss and she stated “she liked me” and asked if the feeling was mutual. No mention whatsoever of guilt. I stupidly made it obvious I felt the same way about her (I am very attracted to her), but I still made it clear it didn’t sit right with me doing anything as she had a partner. 

The messaging continued then we started meeting up for things like a coffee or walk in the park. After this she started saying how I needed to come to her house for dinner.  I tried so hard to resist as I knew what would happen but eventually she wore me down and I ended up going round for dinner. Then after several hours of her all over me she dragged me up to bed. 

I’ve never done anything like this before or been a part of this sort of thing and after sex I immediately felt horrendous again. She didn’t make any such statement about feeling bad or if we had made a mistake. All along she would just tell me how she couldn’t ignore her feelings for me. Because of this I genuinely felt she wanted to be with me and that her relationship with her partner was effectively over anyway. 

So we continued what we were doing, having sex almost daily which was amazing. However certain things were happening causing me concern. She got some flowers from her ex partner and instead of throwing them she put them in her living room. She didn’t take down photos of her and him from her walls. She kept his date of birth as her PIN code on her phone. 

We carried on as this for weeks on end in secrecy until people started asking questions. Her ex started asking questions as up until this point she still was effectively just ignoring him and telling him she needed space (outrageous I know). I was angry at this but I felt it’s not my place to tell her how quickly she should move on etc. 

Things came to a head several weeks later when her ex became suicidal and was put on leave from work. Even though she was told this about her ex and she said she felt terrible, she was fine about it an hour later and still asking me to bed. Again, I found this strange behaviour as I felt terrible for her ex even though I’d never met him. 

Fast forward a few weeks and we seem to be going well, I’ve been paying for dinner meals and nights out which has cost me a fortune which I could ill afford but I thought she was worth it, discussing plans for summer. But still slight things concerned me, she couldn’t remember when my birthday was and started doing things that made me jealous like paying more attention to other men at work when I was around. I’m not a jealous person normally but this behaviour put me on edge. 

Then she suddenly changes in the space of a week.  She becomes suddenly distant with me at random days then the next day she is all over me wanting sex. I just figured it was her behaviour (she is emotionally different let’s say).  Then she abruptly starts ignoring me. This went on for a few days then she asks to meet for a talk where she tells me it’s over. Her reason is she needs space. But she’s so sure it’s over she hands me back any items of mine that were at her house.  She doesn’t bother to ring or check up on me the following week with a single message even though I made it clear before I left her how much her ending it affected me. 

I’m absolutely devastated at this point wondering what I’d done wrong. The days turn into weeks and at work she’s distant with me on certain days then on other days she’s flirting with like bumping into me and stuff like that, giving me completely mixed messages. She would go for days not texting me then other days she’d be messaging me. 

I tried to speak to her on several occasions and whilst she’s not very forthcoming with information she says how her and her ex are back in touch. 

Then I find out she’s the one who’s gone chasing him back (despite the fact the first month she “left him” he was chasing her back), and he’s initially weary of taking her back for obvious reason he suspects she’s cheated but she is downplaying it saying nothing really happened. I then find out they are fully back together and she is now blanking me at work as if she’s never met me. 

I’m really struggling to see how can someone do this to someone else. There must have been reasons she cheated on him initially but whenever I try to ask her that she plays it down as if she didn’t say it. It seems to me that she never fully left him, and that she lied to me from the start to get me into bed and have some fun as she knows if she would have said from the start she just wants fun I would have never gone along with it. 

I feel so betrayed as I’ve spent so much money on her, given her so much emotional support when the shit really hit the fan as her family essentially disowned her for a while due to how she was behaving. And why did she literally initiate the whole thing, tell me so many nice things (essentially saying she loves me without saying it), to just use me and have sex with me literally until the day before she decided she’s done with me and she’s gonna get back with him. 

I genuinely feel sorry for her ex as he’s clearly not been told the full story and he’s probably thinking it’s a miracle she’s gone back to him. Plus the way she’s literally just ended it with me and thrown me out like a piece of trash, she told me it’s better to do it now than later (ending it), so me and her was never going to be a long term thing despite what she was promising me from the start. We went from literally messaging and speaking to each other every single day to nothing. 

I’m devastated. ",2,1744992134.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1k28hdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k28hdm/i_have_never_met_and_interacted_so_much_with_such/,I have never met and interacted so much with such a mean person,"I am a 23 year old guy, my girlfriend and her twin sister are 21. Before I knew either of them well, I had a way of discerning who was who by their demeanor. My girlfriend has a good soul and the way she talks and carries herself is a reflection of that. Her twin sister is a complete 180, atleast towards me. The only way I feel I can accurately describe the way I see my girlfriends twin sister is as narcissistic, unrepentant, and rude.
     I feel my twins sister narcissism is especially strong when she is drinking. I get we all need to be on good terms with ourselves, but there's a certain amount of humbleness that separates those of us connected to reality and those in their own world. All three of us are in a pretty cool industry that is predominantly male, so I understand her achievement there. The problem starts when I hear her complimenting herself to the point the conversation steers more towards how she is an awesome person. I hear her say things about herself I don't think she has a full understanding of. She loves talking about her independence but has plenty of boy issues. She loves talking about how nice she is; I'll get to why I think this is wrong later. Overall she's got what I see as an over inflated ego. It's not that she talks consistently about this to the point it's annoying, it's more the fact she says this after the way I see her treat others that gets to me.
     Before my girlfriend and I were dating, her twin sister had no filter and expressed her strong personality around and towards me. I don't think I've ever felt this much anxiety being around someone. Her personality could switch at a moments notice and I found it easier to stay on the defensive when I was near her. She swears a lot which I understand can be fine depending on the way you were raised, but the way I see her swearing leans more towards putting people down; name calling essentially. She has done plenty of things to me I feel warrant an apology; smacking things out of my hand to locking me out of a car. I have heard her say I'm sorry once, otherwise she uses silence and avoidance as her defense. She has trouble using basic manners and I have a library of stories I have started keeping track of. I will write them out if anyone is curious.
     Another thing that makes me pretty angry is the way she treats my girlfriend. My girlfriend is more of a mother than a sister to her. I have gone over to their house plenty of times where I walk in to my girlfriend cleaning or doing the stack of dishes while her sister is tucked in their room or at someone else's house. I'd like to believe the house chores get split, but most weeks I visit almost everyday and see the same thing. For a while my girlfriends sister would throw her crap and belongings on my girlfriends bed and leave it there for my girlfriend to sort through. She's not exactly messy, but I see her as someone who prefers to pawn off chores or put them off for a while. 
     Just a few days ago the three of us were driving to a town for a meeting. My girlfriends twin sister asked my girlfriend if we could stop at a coffee place, played a sad tune to convince her to turn and called my girlfriend a bitch when she didn't tell the lady at the drive through to add cream. My girlfriend drove us to this meeting, paid for coffee, and never got a thanks. My girlfriend told me later it was all jokes but it made me upset. Later that night we went to a restaurant to eat. Everything got put on one bill and my girlfriends sister did make an attempt to pull her wallet out but put her money away right after she saw she only had eleven dollars. My girlfriend put a twenty down and I shouldn't have done this, but grabbed the bill and put it in the middle of the table. This started another run of angry silence and avoidance. Yesterday I apologized to her for this, and I also apologized for the past month for other strains we had. She didn't say anything or look up from her phone.
     Like I said earlier, there's a lot of stories I could drop that have given me this negative view of my girlfriends sister. Simply put I think my girlfriends sister is a horrible person. I wish I could avoid her, but doing this would mean losing time spent with my girlfriend. They both share a room and are usually around each other. In any other world it would be easy to avoid this problem, because most adults would remove themselves from this person. I have communicated before what I thought of my girlfriends sister to her, but all it did was cause a few weeks of silence. I don't mind it, but I do because I have never felt this much disdain about anyone before. I also know if my girlfriend and I do marry she will still be a part of my life. I don't know what advice I am specifically looking for, I am very lost and just want to know if I'm missing something obvious. Please ask questions for more details because I know there is a lot left out. Thanks.",1,1744992100.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

They Should’ve Stayed Quiet

People don’t get it. I thrive off the hate.

If they would’ve just stayed quiet and kept sipping their lukewarm, potato notes opinions, I might’ve tapped out from sheer boredom. But… they couldn’t help themselves. They wasted their precious time trying to gatekeep a space they don’t even understand, hoping I’d fold. Instead, I got sharper. Stronger. Caffeine + adversity = domination.

Let’s get something straight.
I’m not here to win a popularity contest.
I’m a shrewd, unapologetic dude who’s carved out a niche by DOING, not debating. I don’t care about the noise from Reddit randos with fragile egos and zero firsthand experience. Most of the false narratives about me, I’ve laughed about them with many of you in the DMs. It’s pure comedy.

& I’ll tell you why!!

Every. 
Single. 
Hater.

Has never been part of the rotation. Not once. Never. They’re the same ones DMing me, emailing me, texting me for the code. Not once. Not twice. Seven times in a month asking for access and then ghosting. Then I see screenshots in coffee discords talking more shit about me, the selection, my mannerisms. These nobodies, unsuccessful, unliked, have the audacity to spew nonsense about me!

That’s why I sent the ultimatum email. ( i said get into the rotation, or gtfo)
That’s why I’m annoyed. 
It’s not hate. 
It’s clown behavior, from these clowns.

I’ve built something that covers the full spectrum from BOPs to the heavy hitters, from daily sippers to legends in the game. There’s something for everyone. And we’re still just warming up.

I appreciate the real support and solid feedback. I take all of it personally because I care. I want this to evolve, to dominate, to be a pillar in this space. This is Phase 1 of a 20 step roadmap. You haven’t seen anything yet.

And yeah. Maybe I don’t have the “self control” to stay quiet when the surface level takes from nonmembers pile up. But I’m not here to appease tourists.

I love criticism. I want to be coached hard. But if you swing at me with lazy thinking, fake virtue, or bitterness masked as feedback, don’t be shocked when I swing back. I’m not here to play nice.

I’m here to win.

So let’s get back to coffee, subscriptions going out soon (I’m just waiting for coffee to arrive), planning new Al La carte drop for mid may.

You immediately jump off from your makeshift bed and with great force hit the ceiling with your head. ""Sheeeesh!"" - you exclaim. Painful spasm moves through your body. As you slowly start to reassemble your broken self, a shape of mysterious person manifests before you.

„It’s so hard to find a competent mod these days... ever since Suscade left me for M@rinel0rd nothing’s been the same” – you think.

A strange figure in a black hat goes by the entrance to your villa.

""I should’ve been a minecraft streamer anyway” 

The bearded plump fellow in a black hat enters your front porch and sees your head sticking out of the window.

- Wha’ a jolly day for some gardening, isn't it mr Beast?! – he yells while making the most dastardly beautiful smile.

- Beast-y! Beasty! – you correct him.

- MrBeast, mr Beasty, same thing, really! 

After a brief silence:

- I’m going to look after those majestic cabbages today, have a nice day boss! 

You continue looking through the window for a bit. The views from your 30-million-dollar residence in Beverly Hills are magnificent. 

""I can't even imagine what would I have done without that Twitch money"" - you think to yourself. ""I'd probably rot now in some hole in Serbia and play SC3 all day"" - the shivers move down your spine as you realize what dreadful and bleak that future would have been. ""I guess  scholarship from Bill Gates Foundation helped too...and Jigly's donations paid for half of this house anyway.""

 Your last faithful companion comes in with a bag full of crunchy chicken wings. 

- That would be all Jigly, thank you.

- Just doing my duty, sir. – he whispers and slowly begins to leave the room.

- Jigly – he stops momentarily while looking at the golden frame of your real-life portrait – have I... could I... was it all worth it? In the end could I have prevented it? 

- It was inevitable – he somberly answers.

- Thank you, Turd... can I do anything for you? 

- Well, you could always unban me...

- That is never going to happen – you both smile. You’re never getting unbanned Jiglyturd! 

As he leaves the Royal Chamber, you can still see him cackling. You boot up your NASA -designed PC and a loud clap followed by a voice, recognizable by all 8.6 billion of beings, can be heard leaving your mouth: ""Ladies aaand Dentlemen all across the flat universe..."" A single smallest of tears goes down your cheek. This is your destiny. You are Beastyqt

I am moving back to MN (where I was born) after a ten-year break in Oregon. One of the things I noticed that is huge out here but not so much in the Midwest are fancy little coffee stands. There are lots of Starbucks and Caribous, but I mean cute little individual spots that sell unique (and actually good) espresso beverages, infused energy drinks, and baked goods. 

This will be one of the biggest things I will miss when moving back, and I want to take it with me. Soooo, I need honest feedback, would you guys be interested in a place like that? 

I am an avid rock climber, so I am thinking of making it climbing-themed, but it would essentially just be a small, independent drive-thru selling high-quality espresso drinks, infused red bulls, some easy grab-and-go food items. It would not cost any more than Starbucks or other chains, and it would bring more of a community vibe. Any feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated! :)

Received it April 9.  Unpacked very carefully, checking all components, and keeping all packing materials in case we needed to return -- all good, no problems.

Set is very beautiful, nicely designed, and appears to be very well-made.  I'm absolutely thrilled with this purchase.  YMMV, but I'm very glad that I went ahead with my order.

I’ve had pretty fine digestion my whole life. Occasional weird poos but nothing I’ve ever worried about, just think “oh I need more water or fiber or less coffee” you know normal bathroom thoughts. Usually 1-2 a day. For a while this year I was having like 👌🏼 picture perfect 💩. Recently it started to become kinda piecey but I wasn’t too concerned. Last Sunday I looked and noticed brightish red colored poo and I convinced myself it was from tomatoes. Also at this time I was having some fridge issues and may have had some raw milk that got a little warm. No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea but occasional feelings of “oh shit I need to go to the bathroom” that often faded and just felt like gas ? Except usually didn’t become gas, just went away. In my lower belly. Some abdominal discomfort that would come and go, never too bad but noticeable. So I was hoping for a weird case of food poisoning ? My great grandma on moms side had colon cancer, my grandma on my dads side had diverticulitis. 
Monitored over the next few days, pooping a little more than usual (2-3 times a day) noticing maybe like a clear mucus on the poo, and very clumpy. Still bright red blood like streaked through or under the poo (once there were floating pieces). 
Tuesday decided to go to urgent care and then er. They did blood tests and a ct scan and said everything was normal and to follow up with gi doc so I am grateful to have my appt next week. After the ct scan I had pebble poop but I hadn’t eaten or drank much that day. It wasn’t hard through, I’m never straining or pushing real hard. Like twice in my life I’ve had blood on tp after going to the bathroom. 

Yesterday I didn’t have any noticeable blood and poo was looking slightly more normal (still a few pieces)but today I had diarrhea with some blood (after drinking coffee ? That may have done too much to my belly). Not any abdominal discomfort yet though. 

I guess I just wanted to get this all out somewhere. Some family history of digestive issues. I’m 36/f and I know these things happen to people younger than me I just have a baby and dealt with melanoma on my arm last year (stage 1a, removed and no reason to think it’s spread but this all has me anxious af) and really I just want to be healthy. 

I know I’m a worrier and that can affect digestion. I’m hoping the dr can give me answers. If you read all this thank you for listening to me cry and talk about my poop. ",0,1744991537.0,coloncancer,3,0.2,False
1k28860,https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1k28860/i_just_patched_the_neovimext_perl_module_with/,"I just patched the Neovim::Ext Perl module with Anthropic's ""Claude Code"" AI product for $5","I just upgraded to Neovim version 0.11 which is not compatible with Neovim::Ext, a plugin that allows you to write Neovim plugins in Perl. The incompatibility resulted in a warning with neovim's :checkhealth command.

I have no immediate need for the module but I did have $5 left in my Claude Code account. I decided to run an experiment and see if Claude Code could handle this since I don't have nearly enough knowledge about Neovim to do it myself.

For those not familiar, ""Claude Code"" is a new product from Anthropic. It's a terminal-based app that allows you to interact with Claude, Anthropic's name for its AI bot. The neat thing about it is that it can run commands on your behalf. You prompt it, Claude tells you what it wants to do, and then you have an opportunity to reject or accept Claude's recommendation.

After about 20 min of prompting and approving Claude's actions blindly, it was able to fix the issue, get the tests to pass, install the patched module, and [submit the patch to the repo.](https://github.com/jacquesg/p5-Neovim-Ext/pull/9) It would have gone even faster if I had my git authentication set up properly so Claude could use it out of the box. Claude even fixed the problem for me, too. The only work I had to do was patiently sip on my coffee between approving Claude's suggestions.

The problem, of course, is I have no real way of knowing if that patch is the best way to fix the problem. That's not going to be a a problem for a non-critical module like this. So like any other patch, the maintainer with more expertise will have to review it before approving it. However, the day is surely coming when coders become too reliant on these tools and introduce some heinous bugs and badly written code into all kinds of critical pieces of software. And the imperative for profit ensures this.

In this way, AI is like a ""self-driving"" car. At first, it's wonderful and magical. However, it gives you the illusion of making you more productive until the day comes when it crashes you straight into a tree while you're playing Mario Kart. And be assured, that day will come.",0,1744991467.0,perl,2,0.5,False

For example today we went to eat and after go for coffee and ice cream. Everything fine , later we went to a church to light a candle.

 But apparently my gf became furious why I spoke to her and because I didn't give her money and I spoke to her she will think bad of us and our future kid . And while driving back home she didn't stop yelling at me and sometimes hitting me (while I was driving) .
While I try to calm my gf , if I speak with her she became more angry, if I don't speak to her she became more angry ,and she didn't stop it and off course I couldn't keep calm and I yelled to her and things got worst.

1k286p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k286p5/i_hate_my_boyfriend_and_its_for_the_worst_reasons/,"I hate my boyfriend, and it's for the worst reasons possible","Its just as the title says. I hate him, and sometimes I think about leaving him. So, we are in our early 20s, and have been  together for about 3 years now, and for the most part things have been okay(ish). He's sweet, funny, cute, and a good listener. He holds most of the financial expenses in our relationship, as I'm currently in college and he works. Hes also the only one driving, as I can't afford to work and do school, and my parents are the ""do it yourself"" kind of people. He has autism, so sometimes it's hard to properly communicate with him. We've had arguments about dates, spending time together, how different his treatment of his friends are from me, and the general lack of contributions to our relationship besides financial support (keep in mind, we don't live together, so the support in question is going places or doing dates, which is something that doesn't really happen.)

   The issue is, he is unwilling to change. I've told him how I feel about how little we go on dates, even offering free alternatives like a beach date, at-home movie date, or a painting date (as I have art supplies aplenty) but he just expects me to accept that he doesn't like the idea of going out and doing something or even staying inside and doing something. We both play video games, but he only ever wants to play one game, and despite my previous attempts at trying the other mobile games he likes, i just can't get into it. I can at least say I try to find an interest in the things he enjoys, but that courtesy isn't returned. On top of that, He doesn't really call or text. If someone were to look at my call logs or text history with him, I'd look like a stalker. He'll go days without a word if I don't contact him first, and sometimes he just plain won't answer. Once, for a whole week, I heard nothing from him.

To try and balance the relationship, I try and do things for him or for his family. I'll cook when I come over, otherwise he'll eat fast food or frozen food most of the time. I make his mother coffee, a ritual I've kind of come to enjoy. I help with cleaning when I can, and I'm there for him at almost any time of the day, even if it's close to midnight and sometimes even after. There have been nights where he asks me to come over for ""certain reasons"", then I make food for the both of us (as I usually miss dinner when I go out with him), and he calls me a lyft to get me home. I do a lot without complaining, and have even abandoned my school duties sometimes to stay connected with him (when i had a full schedule). Even after I stopped receiving student loans and started looking for a job to pay for classes, I still did as much as could, while he made fun of me not being able to find a job for about 3 or 4 months. 

Our Relationship feels like it's gotten...lazier. It feels like he doesn't consider me as often because I'm always there for him, ready to come if he needs me. However, I can't really say I rely on him in the same way. More than once has he shown me I can't expect him to be there for me. He's ditched helping me with a project for class, something we talked about for two weeks, to stay up and play video games with his friend the night before, and, as a portion of my work relied on his presence, I ended up missing crucial information that made the project easier to understand. He's cancelled plans to play games or hang out with his friends, and while I try to be understanding as one of his friends lives two hours away and doesn't visit often, it still hurts when plans made weeks in advance are ditched. Not to mention, his treatment of his friends and I are vastly different. Even between his two best friends, I've witnessed him favor one over the other (ex: one friend he got two fairly thought out gifts, and for the other he gave a copy of the less impressive gift for the first friend, a charger themed after a video game.) For my birthday last year, he talked about taking me to a place I've wanted to go to again since i was little, but we never ended up going, and for our second anniversary (same month as my birthday) he tried to pass off a gift as both for my birthday and for our anniversary. Even with very little money, I got him a bag of his favorite snacks and drinks for his birthday. For his best friend's birthday? He took me shopping with him and his best friend so his friend could pick out a birthday gift. He chose a salt gun, im guessing around $15-$40. He told me about a boat tour and dinner he, his friend, and his friend's sister went to for his friend's birthday. 

The times I tried confronting him have never gone well. Like I said our relationship was fine. In the first year, he made me feel like I mattered to him, and that he wanted to spend time with me. When we stopped going on dates, even simple ones, I asked to talk to him about it. We sat down, talked, and for a few weeks he changed, but went back to before after a while. One day, he took me for a walk, and said he doesnt really like going out in public very much, and that we can spend time together without going outside. I agreed as long as we did some things every now and again. We didn't, not without me planning it, and being persistent. Eventually, I gave up on dates. When I tried pointing out the difference in how he treats his friends and me, and the difference in priorities, he said his priorities lied elsewhere, and that our relationship was fine as is. (this is around the time the whole birthday thing happened, and when i hadn't heard from him in a week).

Since then, I've kind of been disconnected. While he's still has said some hurtful things, I've been hurt less by them and either catalogue them in my mind or just forget. I still do the things I do, I still say I love you, and in some capacity I mean it. I just don't know if this is what I want for myself, if having someone like my partner is what I want for my future. We have very big differences in aspirations, and what we want for the future (he wants kids but no marriage, I want to be married before kids), and the conversation never goes anywhere because of how dodgy he gets when the topic of marriage comes up. As I said in the beginning, he's a fine partner, as a boyfriend, I'd say our relationship isn't terrible. We still have our moments where our relationship feels solid and good, but then he does or says something and it's like I'm pulled into a headspace where I question if this relationship is worth it. Seeing him a husband, or as a father to my kids, is difficult. 

These points have kind of accumulated into a dull spike of rage, disappointment and sadness on my side of our relationship. The reason why these points are somewhat didiculous is because not all his absenteeism and bare minimum effort is on purpose. I can't be mad at him for some things, like with the whole birthday situation, he had close family in the hospital, they ended up there day of my birthday so I can't really be mad. I'm upset he didn't think to try and give me a better gift like I would've (and have done) for him. As stated previously, his friend who he cherishes is hours of of the city, and can only visit during  spring and summer break. I try to be understanding when he comes, limiting contact so they can reconnect. When he quit his part time job, he was struggling to find a new one, and was in a flunk for a while. We didn't hang much, and he needed space, which I gave him. Once he started his full time, I heard less from him, which again I understood and tried to work around his schedule. When someone he knew was murdered and his pet died, I gave the all the support I could. He's had his reasons for going low contact sometimes, or not giving much of an effort, and when those situations occur I try to show I'm on his side and I'm not going to go nuclear because of situations he couldn't control. 

I just wish he would listen. I wish he would understand. I wish I didn't feel so secondary in his life, and I wish I could fix this with my own two hands. However, despite all this, if I were given a chance to go back in time to when we started this relationship and was given the option to change my decisions, I wouldn't, and sometimes I resent myself for not leaving when things were going haywire sooner. I wanted to believe this could work, that if I waiting and was patient and understanding and used communication that he'd at least try. I still love him, and the person he used to be, and the visions of that person I catch flashes of occasionally, but I sometimes feel like I shouldn't let my love for the person I met and the sliver-thin chance of seeing that side again keep me from a better, less stressful future.",1,1744991366.0,Vent,2,0.99,False

**Why This Pick?**

Both of these squads are rolling out their better starters today. J.T. Ginn (1.69 ERA) has only had one start so far this season, but he did an exceptional job, holding the New York Mets to just 1 run (The Athletics won this game). Brewers starter Freddy Peralta has seen a bit more time on the mound with 4 starts under his belt – all of his starts have seen 8 runs or fewer. I say the Under hits here, friends.

Not since I left for college. The siding was more weather-worn than I remembered, and the porch steps creaked louder under my weight. Everything about it looked smaller, sun-faded, and tired. My parents didn’t live there anymore. After the divorce, they held onto it out of some quiet, mutual guilt, neither one wanting to be the one to let it go. But now that I was technically an adult, they said it was time.

I was only there to collect what was mine. A few boxes, maybe a crate of old clothes, some books, and whatever junk I had left behind in the attic. The idea was simple: go in, pack, leave. But nothing about stepping through that door felt simple.

The living room still had that hollow smell, a mix of dust and old couch fabric. Most of the furniture was already gone, but my feet still knew where to walk, where not to. I climbed the attic ladder slowly, not because it was steep or broken, but because I didn’t want to see what was up there. The attic had always felt stuck in time.

Boxes were stacked along the walls, all of them labeled in my mom’s handwriting. Winter clothes. Kitchen stuff. There was one that just said ""Toys."" The marker had bled into the cardboard from years of moisture. I peeled it open and sifted through it lazily.

The first thing I saw was an old set of plastic binoculars. Bright green, with one cracked lens and a faded strap. I remembered using them in the backyard with Daniel, calling out pretend sightings of exotic animals, shouting through the brush like we were explorers. Beneath them, I found a handful of scratched Hot Wheels cars, still chipped in the exact same places I remembered. A wooden puzzle with a few missing pieces. Our old rubber snake, the one Daniel used to hide under my pillow when he wanted to mess with me. My throat caught for a second, and I smiled without meaning to.

But then I saw it.

Buried under a pile of action figures and a plastic dinosaur was the old walkie-talkie.

My hand froze before I even touched it. I didn’t know why. It was just a piece of, scratched metal, dusty, long since broken. But my stomach twisted anyway. My mouth went dry. I hadn’t thought about it in years. Not since Daniel.

I picked it up. It wasn’t as heavy as it used to be when we were kids, or maybe I had just grown that much. The antenna bent sideways, and the entire thing was a mess. But something in my chest folded inward the second I held it.

There was no reason for the panic that came with it. No reason for my hands to start sweating.

I sat with the walkie-talkie for a long time, cross-legged on the attic floor, staring at it in my palm.  
  
A memory floated up without warning. Daniel's voice coming through the static of foggy recollections. ""This is Eagle Two to Base. Over."" His voice was always too excited for the game. I used to roll my eyes at how seriously he took it, but I never told him to stop. I’d play along, ducking behind trees and whispering into my own walkie-talkie, pretending I couldn’t see him even when he was in plain sight. Our games of pretend worked so well because we believed each other

We spent hours out there. In the woods behind the fence, where the trees grew close and the ground was soft with old leaves. It was never a question of what to play. We always went straight for the woods, always with the walkie-talkies. We were explorers and soldiers, but most importantly, we were brothers. I remember his laugh carrying through the branches.

Then came the accident.

I don’t let myself think about it. Daniel snuck off  into the woods alone. Maybe chasing a bird. Maybe just playing by himself. My parents always wondered why he’d go off on his own. He slipped near the creek, fell into the water, and couldn’t get out. He died of hypothermia sometime in the early hours of the morning, before anyone noticed he was missing.  
  
I say it the same way every time, even though my voice gets tighter with each telling. My parents were shattered. They held it together for me, but it was never the same. After the funeral, everything felt quieter. Nobody used the word haunted, but I felt it in the way they looked at the woods, in how no one ever stepped past the back fence again.  
  
I put the one I found in my backpack and climbed back down the ladder. I didn’t look back at the box. I didn’t want to see anything else.  
  
I got back to my apartment late that night. The drive wasn’t long, but my head felt heavy the entire way. I kept glancing at my backpack in the passenger seat, half-expecting to hear something from it. The walkie-talkie hadn’t left my mind since I pulled it out of that attic box. I couldn’t explain why.  
  
I dropped my keys on the counter, kicked off my shoes, and sat on the edge of the couch with the walkie in my hands again. It looked even older under the apartment light. I flipped the switch on out of habit. No power, it seemed at first. But when I held the talk button down, there was a faint hiss of static. It buzzed for a second, then cut off. I let go. Pressed it again. Same thing. Just a faint buzz.

The batteries should’ve been dead. That was the first thing I thought. I opened the back panel and slid them out. The battery compartment was corroded. A sort of green-white crust fell out of the battery compartment. I let the batteries out, but out of some weird curiosity, I pressed the talk button again.

Static.

It was quiet and broken, but it was there.

My thumb hovered over the button again, but I didn’t push it. I just set the thing down on the edge of my desk and rubbed my eyes.

Maybe the walkie was damaged in some way, feeding on leftover static from nearby frequencies, I didn’t want to think about it too much. I didn’t know. I didn’t care to dig too deep into it. It was just a ghost of a toy. Nothing more.

I left it on the shelf near the window. That night, I brushed my teeth, plugged in my phone, and got into bed. The room was quiet except for the occasional cars outside and the hum of the fridge in the kitchenette. I was drifting when I heard it.

A low crackle. Just for a second.

I sat up. Listened. Nothing followed it.

I didn’t even press the talk button this time.

Still, I laid back down and tried to sleep. I told myself not to overthink it.  
  
I woke up to static.

Not loud, but enough to stir me. I turned my head and saw the walkie-talkie still on the shelf, right where I had left it. A thin, shallow hiss. Again, I hadn’t touched it.

I sat up and stared at it for a minute. Thought about unplugging it, even though it wasn’t plugged into anything. I laughed to myself as I reached over and dropped it into the top drawer of my desk. Closed it gently. Out of sight, out of mind.  
  
Then I tried to start my day.

Classes were fine. I half-listened to lectures and nodded in the right places. I didn’t want to admit it, but the sorrow of losing Daniel was hitting me all over again. I met up with friends in the afternoon, hung around campus, grabbed drinks at a place near the quad. I laughed at jokes I didn’t fully hear. By the time we were stuffing our faces with greasy sandwiches from a cart that only opened after dark, I had nearly forgotten about the walkie-talkie altogether.

I stumbled back into my apartment just before midnight. I dropped my bag, kicked the door closed with my heel, and leaned against the wall to get my balance. Everything felt hazy in that warm way that comes with drinking.  
  
Then, before I could even get my thoughts straight, I heard it again.

The drawer was closed, but I heard the crackle. This time it wasn’t soft. It had an edge to it. A sharpness, like something was trying to come through. I stood there and listened with a focus I didn’t know I could have while inhebriated.

The sound shifted. The static dipped and broke apart, like wind through a microphone. There was something else under it. Just a murmur. Something too soft to make out, but too exact to just ignore.

I practically ran over, opened the drawer and stared down at it.

The walkie-talkie was  cold in my hand. The noise didn’t stop, it might have even gotten louder. It whispered under my fingers. I gripped it tighter, waiting for something more. But it just kept crackling.

I put it back in the drawer and went to the bathroom to splash water on my face.  
  
I dried my face with a towel and leaned against the bathroom sink. My head was buzzing, but not from the drinks. Something about that sound from the drawer had stuck with me.

I hesitated before stepping back into the main room.

The apartment was so quiet it felt loud. I closed the bathroom door behind me and walked back toward the desk. The drawer was still shut. I stared at it for a long second, then turned away to grab a bottle of water from the kitchen.

That was when I heard it.

Clearer than anything before.

“Jackie?”

My heart stopped.

It came from the drawer. Through the static. A child's voice. Soft, but… watery?

I froze in the middle of the room, bottle still in my hand. My name… no one called me that anymore. Not since I was a kid.

I took one slow step toward the desk. The voice didn’t repeat itself. The crackle faded, but the echo of the word was still alive in my head.

I opened the drawer and stared down at the walkie-talkie. It hadn’t moved, obviously, and even the static was not present anymore. But I swear the air around it felt different.

I reached in, picked it up, and almost immediately dropped it. It wasn’t hot, but it felt wrong in my hand. Off. Like it remembered something I didn’t.

I sat down and just stared at it on the floor. My pulse was hammering now, and still I gave myself a million excuses. Old electronics did weird things. It was probably feeding off static interference or some forgotten frequency band. Maybe even a neighbor’s baby monitor somehow.  
  
I put the walkie-talkie back in the drawer.

But it didn’t stop.

Every time I was alone, the sound came back. Sometimes it was faint static, barely audible unless the room was silent. Sometimes it was louder, the crackle building into a voice just at the edge of understanding. I’d be brushing my teeth, or pouring coffee, and I’d hear it behind the door. A soft, rising hiss. Then, sometimes, words.

""Why?""

That one came through clear. I stood frozen in my kitchen when I heard it. The voice didn’t sound angry. It didn’t even sound confused. Just hurt.  
  
After that I moved it to the hall closet. I didn’t want it near me when I slept.

After, it sobbed. Quiet and fragile. I stood outside the closet and listened to the sound of a child crying through layers of static, not sure if I wanted to open the door or run.

I didn’t do either. I just pressed my hand to the wood and stayed there.

One night, I walked past the closet to get to the bathroom and heard it again. Soft and unmistakable:

""I'm scared.""

I didn’t go back to sleep after that.

I needed to shut it out. I picked up extra shifts at the coffee shop. I went out whenever I could. I stayed in motion. Worked through lunch, met up with friends in the evenings, smoked when I was alone, drank when I wasn’t. I told jokes. I laughed harder than I felt. I hooked up with someone I didn’t really want to see again, just so I wouldn’t be alone in bed.

But every time I came home, the apartment felt heavier. I would avoid the hallway. Wouldn’t even glance at the closet when I walked by. It was now constantly mumbling, I could always hear it through my front door before I even entered. Not loud enough to make out, but constant. Always there. I couldn’t even tell anyone about it. What would I tell them? I was hearing children through a walkie talkie?

I wanted to throw it out. I wanted to drive to the edge of town and leave it in a ditch.

But I couldn’t.

Because it was ours.

Because no matter how broken it was, no matter how wrong it felt, it still held pieces of him.

We loved those walkie-talkies. I remembered him carrying his everywhere. I remembered the look on his face when we got them. I still loved him. I always would.

So I left it there.

Even though I knew something was wrong.

Even though I could feel it getting worse.  
  
The dreams started again without warning.

I hadn’t dreamed about the forest in years. But now, every night, it pulled me back. The trees were always tall and imposing. They leaned inward, bending in ways that made the sky vanish. I heard rushing water, constant and fast, but I could never see the creek at first.  
  
I would just wander aimlessly, until it came into view.

Daniel lay in the middle of it. Face down. Motionless. The water moved around his legs, dark and fast, tugging at the hem of his soaked shirt. His arms hung stiff at his sides, elbows slightly bent, fingers bent in unnatural ways. The skin on his hands looked swollen, loose around the knuckles.

Eventually, he would lift his head.

His face was pale and sunken in strange places, as if parts of it had softened and slipped beneath the surface. His cheeks bulged around the edges, pockets of water pressing under the skin. His eyes were clouded, no light in them, just a dull gray sheen with no focus. His lips were split, stretched back from his gums, teeth showing through like they had been clenching for hours. Small pieces of hair clung to his forehead in wet clumps, plastered flat against his skin.

Sometimes his jaw would shift slightly, twitching, as if he was trying to speak but couldn't remember how. Other times, he would scream. The sound didn’t match the motion. His mouth would barely move, yet the noise came out loud and sharp, tearing through the forest.

One night, when he finally did speak, it was a whisper pressed against my ears.

""It's not funny anymore.""

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat. My sheets were damp. My hands were clenched into fists so tight I had to pry them open. I left the lights on for the rest of the night. Still, I could hear the water sometimes. Not just in dreams.  
  
The thing that would forever change me, happened after a long night out, not long after the dreams started. I had stayed at a friend's place too late, drank too much, and talked to people I barely remembered by the next morning. I wanted to feel normal again. I wanted to laugh and pretend things were fine. That night, I almost pulled it off.

But when I got back to the apartment, something felt off, worse than usual.

The hallway light was on, though I couldn’t remember leaving it that way. I walked past the closet and paused, half-expecting to hear the usual quiet mumbling.

Instead, the walkie-talkie started screaming.

Not a voice. Not words. Just screaming. Raw and wet. It sounded full of water, full of pain, stretched thin across static. My knees buckled. I opened the closet, reached in, and grabbed it without thinking. The sound poured out of it, too loud for something that small.

I slammed it against the wall.

The screaming stopped.

I stood in the middle of the hall with my chest heaving. I felt sober in a way that made my skin itch. Bits of plastic and wire scattered across the floor. The casing was cracked in two, one half still buzzing faintly.

I couldn’t sleep. I felt guilty and so, with shaking hands, I picked up the pieces, and brought them back to my bedroom. I taped the body back together, wrapped the antenna with duct tape, did whatever I could to make it whole again. It didn’t take much. The second it held shape, even loosely, the speaker crackled.

Then came the voice.

""Please come back, Jackie.""  
  
And the screaming started again.

It blared through the speaker so loud I nearly dropped it. Not words. Just a wet, broken scream, stretched until it didn’t sound human. It tore through the room and pushed into my skull, the sound of someone drowning with their mouth open. I tried to turn the knob. Nothing happened. I flipped the switch off and on again. No change. It kept screaming.

I stumbled backward, clutching the thing like it might burn me. The scream dipped for a moment, then shifted. It didn’t stop, but it changed into something worse.

""Where are you, Danny?""

The voice was sharp now. A child’s voice, trying to speak through water. The speaker gurgled with every syllable. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the walkie. I set it down on the desk, but the noise didn’t stop.

""I’m scared.""

It said it again.

""I’m scared.""

Again.

""I’m scared.""

I backed away. My shoulder hit the edge of the doorframe. My chest felt tight. I could hear my own breath rising over the static, but the voice kept going. Then everything stopped.

Silence.

Three slow knocks against my bedroom door.

My bedroom. Just inches from where I stood. The knocks came again. Slower this time.

Then came the dripping.

A soft, steady tap, tapping on the floorboards right outside the door. I couldn’t see it, but I could hear it, and somehow that was worse. I imagined bare feet standing on soaked wood. I imagined water running down the other side of the door. I stared at the handle, convinced it would start turning.  
  
And right before I felt like it would, the memories all came back in a rush, not as a clean memory or a full scene, but as a sinking weight in my chest, a sharp crack in the middle of my thoughts that forced everything else to fall through.

We had snuck out that night.

I was the one who planned it, the one who whispered the idea across the room while our parents slept behind the wall. Daniel had been hesitant, always more careful than I was, but when I showed him the flashlights and told him it would be just a few minutes, just a quick game in the woods, he nodded and smiled and followed me without asking any questions. He always followed me. Even when he shouldn’t have.

We went through the back fence the way we always had, through the loose panel near the shed, and stepped into the woods with our lights flicking ahead of us, our sneakers pushing through wet grass and the sound of night pressing in from all sides. I remember the way his laugh bounced between the trees, how it made everything feel safe for a little while. He and I loved the idea of sneaking out, being mischevious. He kept his walkie-talkie pressed to his mouth, calling out dumb nicknames, trying to sound official, trying to make it into a real mission. I teased him for it. Told him he needed to stop acting like a baby. He just laughed again.

At some point, I told him we should play hide-and-seek. That he’d count to thirty, and he had to find me, and that we wouldn’t leave until he did. I promised I wouldn’t make it too hard for him. He grinned at the idea and bolted into the underbrush with his flashlight swinging side to side, shouting “I’m gonna start counting now!” as his voice disappeared behind the trees. 

I turned off my flashlight and walked in the opposite direction. Not into the woods, but out. Through the fence, across the yard, and straight into the house. I wanted to mess with him. Just a little. I wanted to scare him, let him call through the walkie-talkie and get no response, let him think I was hiding from him while I lay warm in my bed. At the time, it felt harmless. Funny, even. I remember thinking I was teaching him something. That he needed to toughen up.

I left him out there.

I climbed into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and waited for him to break character. I expected to hear the door creak open, hear him come stomping in with fake anger in his voice. I thought I’d hear the walkie-talkie chirp with one of his goofy catchphrases, some dramatic line about how he survived the mission.

Instead, I heard static.

The walkie-talkie was in my hands, turned to his frequency. It was just fuzz at first, cutting in and out, but then something else pushed through. I couldn’t make out the words then. It didn’t sound clear, just wet and broken, full of wind and distance. A voice trying to climb through a storm.

I fell asleep listening to it.

I don’t remember when the sound stopped, only that I was still holding the radio when the sun came through the blinds.

Now, standing in my room, with the dripping still faintly echoing from the other side of the door and the walkie-talkie pulsing with heat in my hand, I understood exactly what it had been saying.

Those broken phrases, the things I had been hearing for weeks, they weren’t new.

I had heard them that night. I had just chosen to forget.  
  
I didn’t realize I was crying until my voice cracked so hard it collapsed in my throat. I dropped to the floor with the walkie pressed against my mouth and shouted into it. I screamed until spit filled the corners of my lips and my voice came out hoarse and shaking. I screamed his name over and over, told him I was sorry, told him I was a coward, told him he didn’t deserve what I did, told him I never stopped thinking about him, even when I tried to forget. I told him I was wrong. That I knew I was wrong. That I left him there because I thought I was better, thought I was clever, thought it was just a joke.

My face was soaked. My cheeks, my chin, my neck. Snot ran from my nose without stopping and I didn’t wipe it away. My chest ached, my stomach folded in on itself, and I kept crying until I couldn’t breathe right. I clutched the walkie like it could hear me better if I held it tighter. I held it until my knuckles were pale, until my palms started to cramp. Every apology came out heavier than the last, every word spilling through clenched teeth, my body shaking under the weight of it.

The walkie-talkie went quiet.

And outside the door, the dripping stopped.

I sat there in that silence, gasping for air, pulling it in through my teeth as if oxygen could push the guilt down, as if saying sorry one more time could rewind anything. I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Minutes, maybe hours. Time didn’t move the same. I didn’t notice when the world went still. I only knew I hadn’t moved and didn’t want to.

But I kept speaking.

I kept whispering into the walkie even after the sound died. I whispered apologies until my throat gave out. I said his name until the word didn’t sound real anymore. I begged him not to hate me. I begged him to believe I didn’t mean it. Even though I had walked away on purpose. The tears kept coming until I had nothing left. Eventually, the words stopped forming. My lips moved without sound, my head slumped forward against the floor, and somewhere in that endless, awful stillness, I fell asleep.

When I woke up, my eyes were crusted shut, and the light bleeding through the window was cold and gray. My mouth was dry, my back stiff, and the walkie-talkie was still pressed between my fingers. I sat up slowly, wiped my nose with the sleeve of my shirt, and stared at the bedroom door.

I didn’t want to open it, but I did.

Right outside the threshold, the wood floor was soaked. A single puddle stretched across the boards. No trail. No source. Just water. Clear, still, and shining faintly under the morning light.  
  
I wiped the morning from my eyes and finally decided to confront it all.  
  
I went back to our family house, one more time.  
  
I didn’t turn any lights on when I stepped inside. The air was stale, and the carpet still held the scent of whatever candles my mom used to burn near the holidays. I walked through the quiet halls, past the photos on the wall, past the coat hooks that held nothing, and into the living room where the furniture had already been taken out. The only thing left was the echo of what used to be there.  
  
I sat down on the hardwood floor. My legs ached from the walk, my chest heavier than it had been in days. I set the walkie-talkie on the floor in front of me.  
  
""I’m sorry, Danny. I was a fool.""  
  
I walked out into the woods the next morning.

The fence behind the shed was still loose, the board still slightly detached where we used to sneak through. It hadn’t changed, though the yard behind me had turned brown with neglect. I slipped between the trees with the walkie in my coat pocket, stepping over fallen branches and patches of soft, sun-choked moss.

I found the spot easily.

I pulled the walkie out and held it for a while without saying anything. The plastic had softened from all the cracks, the tape holding it together beginning to peel at the edges. I looked down at it and said his name. Then I said I was sorry. One last time.

As if it heard me, the static finally stopped, and it felt like it had stopped for good.

I knelt and dug a small hole beneath the roots of a tree. Not deep, just enough to place the walkie inside. I covered it with soil, pressed the dirt down flat with my hands, and sat there with my back against the tree trunk.

There were no prayers or closure.

Only silence.

A wind moved through the branches. The leaves overhead swayed gently, their sound brushing the top of the trees. I sat there until I couldn’t feel the weight in my chest anymore, and everything inside of me emptied out.

I go back there sometimes.

Not for guilt or out of fear. I sit with the tree and the dirt, the same ground where we once played, and I talk to him.  
  
And when I do, I imagine he’s somewhere close by.

A little(?) has been coconcious a lot lately, which is fine I suppose because she’s quite competent and keeps us balanced, but she also has the capacity to handle the world as a child. I don’t know the word for it, but I guess another person is playing her caretaker? Complete with petnames, support, affirmations, the whole nine yards.

Great for her. Great for them both, actually. Makes us get up and out of bed. We get stuff done. We get work done.

However. It’s kind of like living with a my little pony. 

I turn over in bed to will myself out and I think about how it will rain and how the buses might be late and in my head I hear a ‘I don’t wanna get up!’ like a toddler, combined with a ‘it’s alright, sweetheart, but don’t you want some breakfast? We could get some tasty biscuits! Or some chocolate milk?’ Which is great but I just wanted to brush my teeth. And now I’ve got a kid hyped up about chocolate milk and what feels like her doting carer chasing after her. In my head.

It’s like I’m in a noir film narrated by a four year old and her mother. What the fuck is this man. I don’t want to complain because it works and it’s a bit stupid to complain about what you’re thinking about but on the other hand, I just feel like our individual personalities are severely mismatched. I feel like a coffee and maybe a long walk before the sun rises is a good start to a day before work. The kid would probably eat ice cream and crawl back into bed in a sugar coma. Her carer spends an hour explaining to her why that’s not a good idea. Probably doesn’t help that I’m a guy, too. I think I’m a normal, if a bit misanthropic man. I live in a mental daycare. 

Dunno. It’s a weird disorder. Still don’t feel traumatised enough to earn it but there’s a kid’s stuffies in my bed and it’s my mascara that’s smeared on its fur where I’ve apparently cuddled it. So that’s that,  I guess. ",2,1744990888.0,DID,1,1.0,False

Can’t find an almond milk pack less than 250 per liter, and coconut milk pack less than 350. This would mean I would be spending 2500-3500 per month on milk or 30,000 - 42,000 per year. On milk🤡

Using the Baby Jogger 2083081 City Select Single Stroller, Jet has been a game-changer for my family. Its standout feature is undeniably the 16+ configurations it offers. Whether you’re using it as a single stroller or a double with the bassinet or second seat add-ons (sold separately, of course), the adaptability makes it feel like this sleek stroller grows alongside your family. I tried switching between configurations just to see how it worked—and surprisingly, it wasn’t complicated. Once, I set it up as a travel system for my niece and later as a reclined bassinet for my newborn nephew, and both options worked seamlessly.

The canopy is another thoughtful touch, boasting a UV 50+ rating; I adjusted it during a sunny day at the park, and it did an exceptional job of shielding my little passenger from the sun while you still get those adorable peeking moments with the clear side ventilation panels. On the design front, I appreciated the streamlined look, with its aluminum frame coated in ""Jet"" black—crisp, modern, and effortlessly stylish. The premium finish definitely turns heads.

**Handling and Performance**

Strolling through city streets, suburban sidewalks, and even slightly rougher paths with this stroller proved to me just how versatile those wheels are. While it isn’t an all-terrain stroller per se, its performance over uneven surfaces was surprisingly smooth. The rubber front wheels swivel for easy navigation around corners or through crowded spaces like shopping malls (a lifesaver), and they lock for stability on bumpier ground.

There’s some heft to this product at 34.1 pounds, but the patented quick-fold technology balances the weight out with convenience. One quick pull, and it folds down flat effortlessly. I even managed it while juggling a squirming toddler, diaper bag, and coffee. The 5-point harness ensures safety, so I didn’t have to worry about my kid wriggling free mid-ride. 

**Strengths**

- Versatile with 16+ configurations to suit growing families.
- Foldable in a single quick motion for convenience.
- UV 50+ canopy protects effectively from the sun.
- Rubber wheels work smoothly on multiple terrains.
- Sleek, modern design with attention to detail.

**Seating Comfort and Storage**

One of my favorite things about this product was its seat. The polyester fabric feels durable but also padded enough for comfort—I could tell my daughter felt snug during our two-hour walk. Reclining the seat was incredibly easy, and I liked how adjustable the footwell was as well. The 45-pound seat capacity works well for toddlers going through their growth spurts.

The storage underneath is surprisingly large. I managed to stuff in a blanket, extra clothes, some snacks, and my handbag without maxing out the space. However, what genuinely surprised me was the single cup holder. Really? One cup? I feel like in stroller world, the lack of more beverage slots is practically a crime. 

**Limitations**

- Heavy build at over 34 pounds can make lifting into a car challenging.
- Single cup holder feels impractical for parents who rely on multiple on-the-go drinks.
- Double stroller conversion kits are not included, adding extra cost.

**Product Rivals**

If I were to compare, the Uppababy Vista V2 came to mind while testing. Both strollers shine with versatility and premium builds, but Uppababy scores points for having a lighter frame. Then there’s the Graco Modes Duo, which is more budget-friendly but compromises on overall material durability compared to this stroller. While this product may weigh a little more, its smooth handling and multiple configurations feel more natural than both competitors combined. Yet, those additional required conversion kits give the rival Graco lineup an edge for budget-conscious families looking for a complete set right out of the box. 

**Bang for the Buck**

Investing in this stroller does come with a price tag slightly above average, but it's built for longevity. The frame is robust and durable, considering the aluminum material. If you calculate the long-term benefits, especially for families planning on multiple children, this could replace buying several other strollers over time. Its adaptability as a single-to-double stroller transitions with ease, adding immense value for growing families. Keep in mind that additional items like bassinet kits and car seat adaptors will rack up extra expenses, so it's best for families ready to commit to the modular setup.

It's literally been 10.5 years since I've even had sex and going into the dating market has been terrifying, but I've really challenged myself to go out of my comfort zone.

In the past four weeks, I have gone on three dates, and have another one scheduled for tomorrow. I got these dates through Hinge. But I'm meeting women in real life, too! This really cute, smart, attentive and interesting girl I've been talking to agreed to get coffee with me soon, as well, and I'm over the moon. I made it pretty clear that I was interested in her, asking if she's single, telling her I'm single, talking about what I want in a relationship, etc. Whether or not this ""coffee"" is a date is purposefully ambiguous, but I'm honestly just looking forward to talking to and spending time with her. I left it ambiguous because I don't actually care if it's a date. When we get coffee, I will tell her I am attracted to her and if things go well, I'll ask her on a ""real"" date. She's honestly one of the most beautiful, sweet, compelling humans I've met in a long time and even if she just wants to be friends I'm grateful that she's willing to spend time with me :)

I know a lot of people on here are struggling with dating and generating attraction, so I want to share some things I've done that have helped me go from yuck to yum.

Internal work -

\- Biggest thing is I have worked on is addressing the shame around my sexuality. I used to feel like it was somehow wrong to flirt with women, tell them you are attracted to them, approach women in public, etc. because it feels like you are being a creep or nuisance. But I know in my heart of hearts that these are human emotions that need to be expressed, and if you play your cards right and do everything with a smile and compassion (and can take no for an answer!) then it's not only okay to do this, but women are often very flattered that you are asking them out, even if they have to say no.

\- The second thing I've done is worked on communication skills. I actively try to be vulnerable with my emotions, and self-disclose things that one might normally would be afraid to share for fear of rejection. Things like how I'm an addict in recovery, or that I am really inexperienced in relationships, or that I have an anxious attachment style, or just when I am feeling afraid or insecure. I share these things openly. Hell, I might even straight up tell a girl I was terrified to come talk to her because I find her so beautiful.

\- Finally, I have just tried to make a lot of female friends (totally platonic) to become a bit more comfortable with the opposite sex.

External work -

\- Pretty simple. I went to the gym religiously to get muscular, got some piercings and jewelry to express myself, have bought a ton of good-fitting clothes, and groom myself thoroughly and regularly. Go to an upper-end thrift store like Plato's Closet to find nice clothes for a good price. I'm telling you, buying some Lululemon apparel is worth the $30. Those clothes cost triple the price brand new and are very well-made.

\- I have taken up hobbies that involve meeting the opposite gender - volleyball and circus aerial performance (women love silks, lyra, and other types of acro). I do straps and it's a blast.

\- I have worked on my career, getting a significant raise at work and continuing to look for opportunities to further my professional experience.

It's possible you guys! Also, you won't believe the confidence you start to develop after going on a few dates and getting some ""yesses"" from women you are very attracted to. Women are right in saying that confidence is huge, but remember that it takes baby steps to get there. Start by initiating conversations with women, small talk and such, then graduate to talking with women you are interested in, then develop platonic M/F relationships, and finally learn to express your attraction with women you like!

A big part of confidence is also, you guessed it, learning to be comfortable ""just being yourself"". That means not being afraid to show who you really are, scars and flaws and everything included. Wear your heart on your sleeve, guys. It really is attractive to be genuine and honest about who you are and how you feel.

To conclude, I want to share a study that I read about recently. Both men and women of college age were asked to use the following line on people they were attracted to around campus. ""Hello, I have noticed you around campus (or in class) and I have always thought you were very beautiful/attractive. Would you be willing to go on a date with me?"" Something like 55% of the men and 65% of the women received ""yes"" as the answer, regardless of their perceived attractiveness. The average rated attractiveness of men and women in the study was 6/10, and the average perceived attractiveness of the ones they asked on dates was 7/10. There was no significant difference in the success of students based on how attractive they were rated as. My point is - STOP TELLING YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH! You 100% are worthy of love and affection JUST AS YOU ARE. Put on some nice clothes, brush your teeth, and go ask out your crush!

Cheers,

*mid-transit to Beta-Seven*

The Vortex of Strategic Profit rumbled quietly through slipstream, a cargo-hauler with more rust than sense and just enough shielding to make insurance optional. In the mess hall, the air tasted faintly metallic, and the nutrient paste of the day was a texture best not discussed.

Gianni sat near the rear, hunched over a mug of what he stubbornly called ""coffee,"" though he suspected it was synthesized from something that had once been alive and screamed. Still, it was hot and bitter. He took comfort in that.

Across from him, Tk'tchell, the J'thar engineer, was carefully grooming her mandibles with a tool that doubled as a vibroscraper. Nearby, Norl, the ship's four-legged enforcer, flexed his cybernetic jaw plates, chewing lazily on rehydrated meat cubes. Vrix, translucent and pulsating gently in his hydration tank, blinked in sleepy purple.

The doors irised open with a hiss and slap.

Captain Xul'dran slithered in with the unmistakable energy of someone who had made a decision without consultation. ""Gianni!"" he called, brandishing a glowing dataslate. ""Wonderful nutrition cycle to you! I bring exciting news!""

Gianni looked up, expectant. ""What now?""

""We are to receive another human!"" Xul'dran wiggled his feeding tendrils. ""You will have companionship. Mammalian solidarity! Perhaps you will... high-five?""

For a moment, Gianni's eyes lit up. He sat a little straighter. ""Really? That's actually not bad. What sector?""

Xul'dran beamed. ""He is from your Earth's... eh... Awest-rahlia. Or is it Ow-strail-ee-ah? The consonants are hostile.""

Gianni paused, blinking.

The warmth in his expression drained away like someone had flicked a life-support switch. He lowered his mug. Very slowly.

""I'm sorry. Did you say... Australia?""

""Yes!"" Xul'dran chirped. ""That is the one. From a region called 'The Top End'! I assume this is a prestigious title.""

Gianni didn't respond immediately. His jaw had gone slack. His left eye twitched.

Across the mess hall, none of the aliens reacted. Tk'tchell hummed a little tune. Norl was still chewing. Vrix glowed a lazy chartreuse.

Then Gianni said, softly, ""No.""

A pause.

""No, no, no. Nononononono! Captain. You... you hired an Australian?""

Xul'dran's limbs curled in a delighted shrug. ""Yes! Isn't that wonderful?""

Gianni stood.

""I thought we had protocols for this. Red flags. Emergency checklists. For the love of God, did no one vet his region?""

Tk'tchell looked up, antennae twitching. ""Is this bad?""

Now the aliens began to notice. Gianni's face had gone pale. He ran a hand through his hair like someone who had just read their own obituary.

""You don't get it,"" he said, voice rising. ""Australia isn't a country. It's a warning label.""

Norl blinked slowly. ""I thought it was part of Earth.""

""It is!"" Gianni snapped. ""And it regrets that fact every summer. If Earth is the galaxy's haunted house... Australia is the basement that's still locked for a reason.""

Now the mess hall was quiet. Vrix turned an uneasy shade of grey. A utensil clattered to the floor.

Xul'dran chuckled nervously. ""But... he was very polite. Said 'no worries' and asked if our hull could handle open flame. I took this as cultural curiosity.""

""That's not curiosity,"" Gianni muttered. ""That's preparation. Captain—they have spiders that open doors. They have birds that form attack squads. The fish lie.""

""How do fish lie?"" Norl frowned.

""They pretend to be sand and stab you when you step on them!""

""- don't even get me started on the emus. Birds nearly immune to projectile weapons. They won a war, Captain. An actual war. Against humans. **And. We. LOST.**""

Tk'tchell whispered, wide-eyed, ""What kind of weapons did they use?""

Gianni turned slowly to face her.

""They're *birds*, Tk'tchell. *Birds.* Non-sentient animals. They didn't *have* weapons. They didn't have language or technology or even opposable thumbs. They couldn't build tools. They couldn't formulate strategy. They were just big, angry birds that refused to die. And somehow, they *still* won. They *were* the weapons.""

The mess hall fell into stunned silence. Norl's cybernetic jaw plates hung open, forgotten meat cube tumbling to the floor. Vrix's translucent form cycled rapidly through shades of alarmed orange and disbelieving blue. Captain Xul'dran's feeding tendrils curled protectively around his face.

""But..."" Tk'tchell finally managed, her mandibles clicking rapidly, ""that's not... that shouldn't be possible.""

""Welcome to Australia,"" Gianni said grimly. ""Where impossible is Tuesday.""

A slow slither echoed near the air duct. Zib, the ship's sole Prikkiki-Ti crew member, emerged—barely two feet tall, pale-scaled and sharp-eyed. The Prikki were feared across the sector: xenophobic, efficient, terrifyingly aggressive. Zib, however, looked uneasy.

""He is from... Australia?"" Zib asked softly.

Gianni nodded.

Zib stared for a long second, then quietly turned and crawled back into the vent.

Xul'dran scratched his head with a tentacle. ""He has an impressive survival record. Says he's wrestled with something called a cassowary.""

Gianni covered his face with both hands. ""Oh God, it's worse than I thought.""

Xul'dran brightened. ""His name is Mitch Irwin! That is a good human name, yes?""

Gianni's face went from pale to ashen. He looked at the ceiling like he might find answers there. ""Irwin? IRWIN?"" His voice cracked.

He staggered back, nearly collapsing into his chair. ""No, no, no. That clan is infamous. Do you understand? IN-FA-MOUS!"" His hands shook as he gestured wildly. ""They don't run AWAY from the most dangerous animals in existence - they run TOWARDS them. WITH A SMILE ON THEIR FACE!""

Gianni clutched his chest, breathing rapidly. ""They pick up venomous snakes. They wrestle crocodiles. They dive into waters infested with things that have more teeth than should be biologically possible. And they call it 'a bit of fun.' A BIT OF FUN!""

He looked around the mess hall, desperate for someone to understand the gravity of the situation. ""I don't know what terrifies me more - the name, or the fact that he probably shortens it to 'Mitchy.'""

A low, metallic bump reverberated through the deck plating. The lights flickered. The ship's stabilizers hissed.

The crew froze.

""...we've landed,"" Vrix whispered.

Xul'dran glanced at the wall panel. ""Yes, Beta-Seven docking clamp engaged. That was our scheduled touch-""

""I told you,"" Gianni yowled, dropping to his knees to better beg to his captain. ""We need to get out of here before it's too late!""

The nearest viewport began to glow with movement. Tk'tchell, compelled by equal parts curiosity and dread, crept forward and peered out.

""Oh,"" she said faintly. ""Oh no.""

The rest of the crew crowded behind her.

Across the docking hangar floor, a human swaggered forward.

He was tall, broad-shouldered and sun-scorched, in worn cargo trousers and a faded T-shirt that read ""If lost, return to pub."" His boots were scuffed. His forearms looked like they'd won fights with industrial machinery. A duffel bag was slung casually over one shoulder. A long scar ran along one temple, disappearing under shaggy dark hair. He was whistling. *Whistling.*

And smiling.

Vrix let out a squeal and sank into his hydration tank with a blorp.

Norl backed into a corner and muttered, ""I'm not trained for this. I'm not trained for this.""

Tk'tchell began hyperventilating through all four spiracles.

A deep clunk came from above. The ceiling vent panel slammed open.

Zib re-emerged, dragging behind him a phase cannon that was nearly twice his height. The barrel trembled slightly in his hands as he took up a braced stance, training the weapon squarely at the airlock door.

""I... I will hold him back!"" Zib shouted, his voice shrill with tension. ""I will buy you time!""

A knock came at the airlock.

A slow, deliberate knock. Three calm raps.

Zib froze.

His eyes went wide. His grip loosened. And then, with a high-pitched wail that echoed off the bulkheads, he dropped the cannon and dived headfirst back into the air duct, vanishing with a clang and a trail of terrified screeches.

The ship's klaxon gave a single confused chirp as someone smacked the internal panic button.

Gianni didn't move. He just watched through the viewport as the man adjusted his sunglasses and gave a two-finger salute to the nearest station worker, who promptly dropped their datapad and fled.

Captain Xul'dran staggered back from the window, horrified. ""Why... why is he grinning?""

""Because,"" Gianni said, very calmly, ""he's about to meet the crew. And he's wondering if you stock VB or if he has to ration the six-pack in his bag.""

From the floor, Vrix whimpered. ""He brought his own alcohol?""

Gianni nodded solemnly. ""Of course he did.""

Outside, Mitch paused. Tilted his head toward the ship. Noticed them watching through the viewport.

And smiled wider.

I’m ok that he asks to split the bill and to transfer him after he pays, but the red flag 🚩 is here: for over 5 mins, he was trying to find his “wallet” from his small bag which only wallet and a phone can fit, and suddenly found his “wallet” right after I settled the bill.

P.S. We both are working adults. I sometimes even buy coffee to friends, so not a big deal even if I have to pay for him. But a guy saying out loud that I have to pay back $6 + tax to him if he gets the bill is just a major turn-off for me.

I usually insist to split the bill as first dates are supposed to be getting to know each other. But it is a good gesture that guys offer to pay first. Even if the guy doesn’t let me pay, I make sure I pay for the next round.

- looks nothing like the photo

Today I dropped the temperature a couple degrees when pulling a shot with the same beans I’ve been using for a couple of weeks.  And wow, it’s even better!  It’s more work to have a machine that doesn’t do the job for you but it’s so rewarding to be able to tweak the settings and be rewarded with an even better shot!  I was a little intimidated at first, but I have no regrets getting a machine that gives me full control of the brewing process.

1k27r2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k27r2h/he_watches_me_in_the_mirror/,he watches me in the mirror,"I was never sure exactly when it began. I think it was on some forgettable Tuesday, one of those mornings when you wake up late and your coffee tastes more bitter than usual. I had been living alone for a few months, ever since Clara left. She kept our apartment—fair enough—and I moved into an old studio near the station. Small, functional, anonymous. Just how I wanted it.

At first, there was only silence. And I liked it. Her absence stung, of course, but there was a secret relief in the lack of voices, of outside noises, of unspoken demands. In silence, everything feels more under control. Safer. But silence also amplifies things.

The first time I noticed anything strange was with the bathroom mirror. It was old, with a dark wooden frame and a slight warp in the glass that subtly distorted the edges of the reflection. Nothing unusual. Except I started to notice a faint delay in the image. Very faint. If I raised my hand, for example, the reflection would do the same a blink later. At first, I thought it was paranoia. Exhaustion, maybe. But a part of me began to watch it more closely. To test it.

I raised my hand at different speeds. I blinked, I snapped my head to one side. Sometimes nothing happened. Other times, I could have sworn the reflection lagged by just a split second. An imperceptible moment to anyone distracted—but I wasn’t distracted anymore. I was waiting. As if it were a message. Or a warning.

I began to avoid the mirror. I showered with the door cracked, I brushed my teeth looking at the floor. And still, I felt watched. A motionless presence, cold, made of glass and shadow.

The days grew shorter. The sunlight didn’t seem to reach the studio floor anymore, even with the window facing west. I swapped in brighter bulbs, but everything took on a greenish tint, as if reality itself were… sickening.

One nameless night, I woke at three in the morning certain that someone had whispered my name. The voice was low, grave, and seemed to come from the bathroom. I lay frozen, my body petrified beneath clammy sheets. The bathroom door was open. I saw the mirror gleaming, even though no light was on. I didn’t go in. I stayed awake until dawn, staring at the ceiling.

At work, I started missing deadlines. Coworkers avoided my gaze. Maybe it was in my head, but there was a strange weight behind their smiles, as if they all knew something I didn’t. I was called into the manager’s office twice in one week. I said I was dealing with personal issues, which was true. But I lied when I claimed everything was under control.

Gradually, the voices grew louder. They weren’t exactly voices—more like echoes of thoughts that weren’t mine. Things I would never say. One night, while making instant noodles, I heard, clear as day, someone whisper, “She’s still here.” I spun around in a startle. No one was there. But the microwave’s reflective door showed me something I didn’t see behind me: a dark silhouette standing just out of reach.

I don’t know how I didn’t scream. I didn’t turn around. I just stared at the reflection until it died when the microwave switched off. Since then, I avoid any shiny surface. I turn off my phone’s front camera. I dim my work monitor. I ignore storefront windows with blind discipline. But I know they—or it—are still there. Waiting.

I began recording everything. A battered notebook hidden inside an old dictionary. I jot down every detail: times, sensations, temperature changes, what the voices say. It’s been my only anchor. My last tether to what I can still call reality. But even that is crumbling. The other day, I found a page written in my handwriting describing something I swear I never experienced. A planted memory. A lie that, somehow, sprouted from my own hand.

I’ve been sleeping little. With every nap, repeated dreams pull me to the same place: a mirrored room where every version of me stares back in absolute silence. Sometimes one of them smiles. A smile too exact, mechanical. As if rehearsing something it still hasn’t grasped.

Today I found the bathroom mirror covered by a dark sheet. I don’t remember putting it there. But it’s firmly taped. I didn’t dare remove it. Later, when I went to the closet for a coat, I saw—through the faint reflection in the window glass—that the sheet was moving slightly. As if breathing.

I’m writing this now because I need to record it. Because maybe tomorrow I won’t remember. Or maybe I’ll remember something else. The boundaries are blurring. I’m beginning to suspect that the mirror never reflected me—but something that watches and learns. That imitates me. That’s waiting for me to weaken enough to step out. Or to step in.

Sometimes I wonder if Clara ever really left. I have no photos of her anymore. No social media. No old messages. Only the vague memory of a soft voice, dark hair, and tired eyes. But what if she never existed? What if she was just the first version replaced?

The neighbor upstairs looked at me oddly today. He said, “You look different today.” I smiled. But I don’t remember smiling. It was automatic, as if someone else was at the controls for an instant.

The notebook is gone.

I searched every corner. The dictionary is empty. No torn pages, no marks. Nothing. As if I’d never written anything. But I remember. I remember everything.

I think I’m forgetting what my own voice sounds like. I recorded an audio yesterday. When I played it back, I recognized the words, but the tone was wrong. Firmer. More assured. As if whoever spoke knew something I didn’t.

The bathroom mirror is broken. Shattered into a thousand microscopic shards. But each fragment still reflects something. Some show angles that don’t exist. Places that aren’t here.

I’m gathering the pieces now. Each one, carefully. I need to see. I need to understand.

Maybe I already understand. Maybe I’m only pretending not to know. Maybe I’m the reflection, and the other—the one on the other side—is the real one.

Maybe it was him who wrote all this.

Maybe he’s just waiting for you to read to the end.

I told her I was going to do it, but it would just be a little because I needed to help out the other customers so the cafe would clear up a little. I had a bunch of people order coffees so I was trying to keep track of who ordered what. The lady came around and was asking me when I would get it ready. Then the shift supervisor came around and put herself into the conversation and asked what the problem was, I told her she wanted the coffee to be grinded but it would be a little longer because I’m still making the coffees for the other people. She grabbed the bag from me and said do you know how to do this (I do) I said yes and she said “you just told the lady you don’t know how. (I think she misheard me) You need to wake up.” This just rubbed me the wrong way. I don’t know. Did I do something wrong? But it wasn’t just this. She almost made a comment about “Baby sitting” “and you have to explain in great detail” or something like that while I was right in front of her and it just upset me even more. Every time she is on shift this kind of thing happens. Even when it’s not peak she does stuff like this.Everybody else can hear her and stuff but they just don’t do anything. Like I said, I am able to hold my own. I’ve done it before. When she is not there, I’m out of everyone’s way. But with her she always finds things to point out with me and talks to me like I’m stupid. I’m tired of it.",2,1744989942.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

I read the [**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1jk9tqg/im_cured/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of u/[Salty-Ice-8481](https://www.reddit.com/user/Salty-Ice-8481/) who claimed that [**multiple rounds of Ketamine Infusions helped him immensely in his fight against CPPS, PFD and supposed HFS Symptoms.** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1jk9tqg/im_cured/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

That's why I thought that this Community might benefit from a Summary of his post that encapsulates the most **important** bits of Information to have.

# Let's Start

**What were his Symptoms?**

Symptoms existing for 4 Years

\- erectile dysfunction

\- pain in the groin

\- pain after urination

\- pain after ejaculation

\- cold sensation at the tip of the penis

\- genital numbness

\- a feeling of pressure in rectum ""etc.""

\- symptoms came and went, at worst they showed up all at once

It must be **stated** that among his Symptoms within the post, he never stated that **HFS (Painful Flaccid Penis Contraction)** was one of his **main** complaints. However in the comments, he does later say that he had **HFS** and that the Infusions brought him **relieve**.

**Diagnosis**

\- Supposed misfiring of the deep perineal pudendal nerve

**What medications did the Infusions contain?**

\- ketamine

\- lidocaine

\- lipoic acid

Everything in an IV infusion into his right arm

**What was the Dosage?**

\- 3mg ketamine per kg of his bodyweight

\- 1mg lidocaine per kg bodyweight

\- 600mg lipoic acid

Everything in a 1 Liter Drip

**What was the rate of reoccuring Infusions?**

\- Waiting for his response

**Where did he get the Infusions and who was the Doctor?**

\- He states that he was treated in the clinic called ""Real Dor"", which is located inside the ""Real Hopsital Portugues Complex"" in Cefira, Brazil

\- He said that his Doctors name was ""Ana Karla Arraes"" who is a pain specialist within the Clinic

**What were the Symptoms that improved?**

\- Immediate full pain relief after first infusion

\- Penile sensitivity gradually returned

\- Kegels painless again; penile muscle control restored (""jumping"" effect)

\- Erectile dysfunction resolved; stopped using tadalafil

\- Sitting and drinking coffee without symptoms again

\- Golf ball sensation in rectum disappeared

\- Genital numbness fully gone

\- Normal urination restored (no urgency or burning)

\- Hard flaccid symptoms fully resolved after several infusions

\- Minor symptom flare-ups responded quickly to further infusions

\- Back to normal daily activities, now only on monthly maintenance infusions

Pain-free for **over 20 days** at time of last update.

1k27kuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1k27kuj/aita_for_banning_my_bf_from_bikini_baristas/,AITA for banning my BF from bikini baristas?,"I \[38F\] started dating my current bf \[34M\] under usual circumstances. I was a gestational surrogate about two months into the gig. I was looking for something exclusive but not necessarily long term. I wanted to have a steady fuck for the duration of the pregnancy without drama. I was lucky enough to meet someone that was down for that. But hey, after seven months I was pretty attached. The day after delivery I was feeling very pragmatic. My hormones had bottomed out and I felt clear-minded and practical. Everything was black and white. We had an agreement that this thing was time-limited. I was post-partum and supposed to abstain from sex for six weeks, at least. What better time to end things? So I gave him an out. I said thank you for your service, have a nice life. And he said that he still wanted me in his life, even if it was as a friend. This was on Tuesday. His birthday was coming up the following week and I had talked to him before about celebrating, but he said he was going to do something with just his family. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we didn't talk much, just exchanged some memes. I had already ordered his birthday present. We talked Saturday and he said he was fighting a hangover. Since I was pregnant while we were dating he had abstained from alcohol as well, so I didn't take him for a big drinker. It seemed odd and out of character for him to have a hangover, but I didn't ask about it.

Tuesday rolls around and I drop my oldest kid off at a job training program. It's my first kid ""leaving the nest"", I was pretty emotional about it. On my way home I hit up my bf, I said I thought I had some stuff at his place and he suggested we get dinner and he could bring it to me. We meet for dinner. I say happy birthday, he thanks me for the gift I gave him. I ask who he went out with to celebrate, thinking it was some guy friends. And he hesitates and I know a gut punch is coming and he says he was with a girl on a date. I ask how they met and he said she's a bikini barista, he'd gotten coffee from her a couple times and he shot his shot. I choked out the words ""good for you, way to get back out there"" while tears started sliding down my face and I felt nauseous. ""I'm an asshole"" he said. The pizza he ordered is delivered and neither of us eats any. I try to rally. I offer to walk him to his car. At his car he says he says it again, I ask him, ""Why?"" and he replies, ""Because I want to kiss you now"". He kisses me and I start crying again.

A couple days pass and he says that he doesn't just want me in his life as a friend. Fast-forward nine months (ironically) and we are in a solid committed relationship. But I'm still hurting about this stupid bikini barista situation. He didn't do anything ""wrong"". Like rationally I know that we were not in a relationship at the time, he was free to do whatever with whoever. But it still hurts. On Tuesday we agreed to end our exclusive relationship and Friday he was out with someone else. And if she had been game he would have had sex with her. I asked him later if he was still in contact with her and he said, ""No, she never texted me back"" and I was like, ""and if she had?"" and he was like, ""then I guess I might still be talking to her."" My guy is honest to a fault sometimes. I don't know how to get past this. I have never wanted to be someone that limited their partner based off of insecurity. But here I am, doing it. Babe, you can't go to bikini baristas anymore. It's ruined now. I will always see it as a threat.

like, uh… Spirit of the Universe, Cosmic Rug that ties it all together,  
we just wanna say thanks, y’know?  
Thanks for the little things—like good coffee, White Russians, and rental shoes that almost fit.

May our lanes stay waxed, our throws stay smooth,  
and may the pins of life fall gently before us,  
unless, of course, we’re being tested,  
in which case… well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.

Grant us the serenity to abide,  
the courage to say “f\*\*\* it” when necessary,  
and the wisdom to know when it’s time to roll.

We ask you, Great Dude in the Sky,  
watch over Walter, even though he’s kinda intense,

* No smokers (cigarettes, vapes, weed, etc.)—I’m not into that.
* No drugs, and I prefer to keep drinking to a minimum.
* Please be single, drama-free, and without kids.

The DVR has quit saving his favorite programs. I don't even see them on my list of things to watch anymore. 

His coffee cup. I never wash it. I never have to. It just sits there. I remember how much bubble wrap he covered that mug in whenever we moved... He did not want that handle to break... I laughed and suggested he fill it with coffee and hold it in his lap when we drove over to the new house... He acted like it never even dawned on him..

His presence is fading. I hate that it's almost like he's disappearing... Like he never existed... The memories that I have of him are starting to turn into memories literally... I don't like the feeling. I don't think I've had an out loud conversation in my own home in three and a half months.

1k27d3t,https://i.redd.it/t1gmmv221mve1.png,The Greater Tankkiwi (Armatapteryx scutifer) [The Downfall of The Beasts],"*A part of my Xenozoic timeline that is set 30 million years in the future and is focused on the world after rabies wiped out most mammals.*

Aotearoa. The last major piece of the ancient continent of Zealandia, before the arrival of humanity it was the kingdom of birds. Giant ratites roamed it's ancient rainforests, accompanied by parrots and rails and hunted by giant eagles. It was essentially a piece of Mesozoic in the Cenozoic world. Humanity changed the balance of forces, bringing in the invasive mammals and greatly disturbing the local biota, wiping out the megafauna and eventually tranforming the unique land of birds into islands mostly full of sheep and stoats.

And for Aotearoa's original fauna, rabies outbreak was not a nightmare but a relief. It killed off the invasive mammals and moved the ancient realm of birds back into the hands- or, more accurately, wings - of it's old masters.

In the Xenozoic, when most of Earth is a sauropsid realm, New Zealand no longer looks so unique, yet it's home to ancient lineages absent from elsewhere, so it's more Australia-like. It has since moved north, almost to the equator, and the two merged islands now are mostly covered in tropical, not subtropical or warm-temperate, woods. It is rainy, hot and foggy. The mountaintops are cool, though no longer have any major glaciation, the mountain tundra is still there and has it's own unique fauna.

New Zealand's ancient flora has mostly fallen victim to the climatical, geographical and biotic changes. Nowadays it is mostly shared with Australia and Southeast Asia, with plants such as dipterocarpaceans, coffee relatives and laurels largely replacing the southern beech, cabbage tree and araucarian family trees or pushed them into cooler highlands. It's fauna also changed significantly, with new birds, amphibians, arthropods, snakes and crocodilians arriving to it's shores. However, many of the old groups, from the tuatara to the kakapo, still have living descendants. And one of these are the kiwi birds.

Originally, the best defence for these slow fossorial insectivores was hiding from the sharp eyes of airborne raptors and kicking with claws if necessary. Nowadays, New Zealand is teeming with predators who rely less on sight and more on other senses and can more easily pursuit a small bird through the understory. So, they developed a new way to defend themselves.

The greater tankkiwi (Armatapteryx scutifer) is about the size of a turkey, but heavier: about 15 kilograms heavy. This large bird lives in tropical rainforests and is nocturnal, actively searching for insects, worms and small vertebrates in the forest floor and soil, using it's keen sense of smell and long beak to pick prey out.

Tankkiwi is unique in having it's feathers transform into an almost pangolin-like scale armor, and it's head is covered in keratin and osteoderms, resenmbling ankylosaurs. Even the eyelids are covered in thick keratinous growth. Underneath the scales, the more typical fuzzy kiwi feathering is present, and some whisker-like filaments, used to search for prey, are on the face. The body is brown, with yellowish legs, and yellow pattern on the osteoderms, used for intraspecific interaction during territorial and sexual demonstrations. The beak is pinkish.

This bird is solitary and tends to have territorial fights when an interloper enters. During attacks by predators, however, the main strategy of defence is sitting down and standing still, it's brown feathering keeping the tankkiwi hard to see and hiding the softer body parts underneath the armor. In case it is directly attacked, the bird will use it's claws and beak to defend.

Breeding takes place year-round due to a warm wet climate in the tankkiwi's home forests. They pair for life, and to find the mate, male will make a growling, guttural call during the night. After mating, the female makes a large burrow and lays 2-4 eggs, each almost as big as a rhea's. The male incubates.

The newborn chick is independent from birth, no parental care is present. The chick is more lightly built and only grows the large osteoderms and thick enough scales some time later, so it's first months of life are spent in constant running away from the predators. It also relies more actively on surface-level insects than the soil-dwelling ones, forming a sort of an ontogenetic niche partition. Unlike adults, early juveniles are somewhat gregarious and may form a small temporary group. They also are less territorial.

Crocodilians, large snakes, monitors and various raptorial birds are the main enemies of the tankkiwi.",4,1744989302.0,SpeculativeEvolution,1,1.0,False

It’s all downhill from here.” But it never got any easier. The +16,000 ft [4,876 m] passes kept coming.

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina. Two days of pavement felt like a luxury. I found kiwi fruits in a small village called Susques and thought I was hallucinating. Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.

I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.

I’m 22, standing at 5'9"", with black hair, brown skin, and a physique that reflects the time I put into the gym. Fitness has been a consistent part of my life, not just for the physical benefits, but because it gives me structure, discipline, and that clear-headed feeling after a good workout. I’m just as comfortable breaking a sweat as I am curled up with a book or getting lost in thought over a cup of coffee.

Reading is one of my favorite ways to unwind and reflect. I enjoy diving into both fiction and non-fiction, stories that transport me, ideas that challenge me, and words that stick with me long after I’ve closed the book. If you’re someone who enjoys exchanging book recs or dissecting random philosophies at 1 a.m., we’ll probably get along.

I also travel often. Some of it’s spontaneous, some of it’s planned, but all of it feeds my need to experience new cultures, try unfamiliar foods, meet interesting people, and see the world through different lenses. I think travel teaches you humility and openness like nothing else can.

As for myself, I'd describe myself as emotionally intelligent, able to discuss things before drawing any conclusions. I'm pretty nonchalant in my general approach to things as I prefer to live a carefree lifestyle rather than one where stresses loom over my head at all times. I'm not particularly kind, friendly or warm, but I'm by all means, respectful, courteous and honest at all times. 

I work a full time job, one that consists of me travelling and being away from home quite a bit so if you're a patient body who can savour the good times till the next one, we'll get a long.


What I’m looking for:

I’d love to connect with someone between 20 and 29 who’s emotionally intelligent, kind, and thoughtful, someone who doesn’t shy away from depth, whether that’s through conversations, feelings, or life goals. I’m really drawn to people who are introspective and curious about the world, people who enjoy meaningful conversation just as much as a silly exchange or a random adventure.

I do like a good shut in adventure too, opting to appreciate the quieter times sheltered in the safety of a home and just enjoy a more peaceful time. One the other hand, more lively escapades are more than welcome so I can truly adapt to either.

If you're the type who can get lost in conversation, who values honesty and connection, and who isn’t afraid to be a little vulnerable, I’d love to hear from you.

Saw this step while getting coffee on a trek to Mcleod ganj and the coffee felt heavenly in that environment - have been doing this ever since. Add milk once it's hot, mix it well and use the blender some more. Tadaa, coffee is ready.

Also, not every coffee from outside is good and from homes too, not everyone knows to make good coffee. Somehow the filter coffees from outside seems to be decent, atleast wherever I tried it from in my locality. I don't drink tea at all, somehow never liked the taste of it.

To begin with, I don't drink Nescafe. I think the last coffee that I tried is Rage flavoured coffees - it was good enough to try different flavours. Had to drastically reduce the suggested milk amount to get the coffee to be of my strength preference though. Got a pack of Tata Coffee grand classic, yet to open it as I still have 3 more rage sachets left. The best coffee that I have tasted so far would be davidoff, don't remember the exact blend though. My consumption of coffee when davidoff was available was more than usual, say once in every 2-3 days or so. I did like Bru earlier, but somehow moved away from it when my family switched to some other brand. Tried ID filter coffee sachets too.

Ps, I did read in the sub rules that instant coffee posts are not allowed, I searched on reddit but I didn't find any instant coffee specific Indian subs hence posting it here. Please be gentle with a beginner coffee lover and I appreciate any suggestions including brands or any other simple to follow methods to elevate the coffee experience.",0,1744988995.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.5,False

It’s all downhill from here.” But it never got any easier. The +16,000 ft [4,876 m] passes kept coming.

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina. Two days of pavement felt like a luxury. I found kiwi fruits in a small village called Susques and thought I was hallucinating. Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.

I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.

Daylight cratered fast in the valley below, as did its frigid temps. I raced south toward lower elevations to camp for the night. More inescapable desert and rusted canyons. More lassos of headwind and salt flat mirages. Dreaming of warm empanadas and wine country.",23,1744988916.0,mountainbiking,0,1.0,False

1k2775c,https://i.redd.it/uabxdnjtzlve1.jpeg,Ye Who Enter: “Autopsy” (An Anti-Hazbin Tale),"Name: Husker

Age: 62

Sex: Male

Species: Cat Demon

Estimated date of death: 1/29/2024

Forensics Pathologist: Sean Hutches

Forensics Note: I got a call early this morning from Officer Mackey, stating they were bringing in the body of our missing demon. I got dressed and came in at 4:45 AM, pouring myself a cup of coffee the moment I entered the lab. From my knowledge, I knew that Husk was missing for several days after the death of Anthony, otherwise known as “Angel Dust” for denizens of the Lust Ring. I wasn’t really into stuff like that, so I didn’t know much knowledge. 
They brought the body in and I removed the sheet covering my work. The first thing I noticed was the lack of wings. If I remember Frederick’s report correctly, the body of Anthony had red wings sewn onto his back. I assume this was who the wings once belonged to.  I turned the body over to see numerous stitches in the location where they would normally be positioned, it was neat and clean but there were a couple of stitches overlapping each other. It couldn’t be professionally done could it? No, these were done quickly as if the killer had little time to prepare. But where could they have done this?

He was still alive during this procedure, but nobody that lived in the hotel mentioned any screaming from the witness reports. He must’ve been sedated or unconscious when it was happening. There is pieces of skin on the claws, so he was struggling against the attacker. Several stab wounds were in the torso, none were aimed at vital organs, so the killer wanted him alive in the moment. Why? Why not just kill him there and be done with it? 
These wounds were done at the time of Anthony’s death. This is certain, but there are more wounds that occurred later on. According to the report, they found the victim in a cardboard box at the abandoned postal warehouse on Mobius Lane. Ironic. The box had holes in it, as if someone stabbed through them. So why didn’t he break out? Was he weak? There’s too many factors I need to consider, but one thing is for certain about our killer.

He’s taking pleasure in his murders. ",4,1744988883.0,AntiHazbinHotel,1,1.0,False

## What is Matrix Code Edge?

Matrix Code Edge is an **automated trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to analyze the crypto (and broader financial) markets, aiming to help users make smarter, faster trading decisions. 

In simpler terms, it's like having a robot assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and places trades for you based on patterns and data it detects. The platform is designed for both beginners and experienced traders, offering **hands-off trading** while still allowing manual control if you prefer. Think of it as your crypto autopilot—but you still get to be the pilot if you want.

## Who Created Matrix Code Edge?

So, who’s behind the curtain? While the **exact developers aren't publicly listed**, Matrix Code Edge follows a familiar model used by other successful platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**. These platforms often come from fintech teams with backgrounds in **AI, machine learning, and financial algorithms**.

Even though the creators remain unnamed, the software seems to have been developed with a strong focus on **usability and performance**, suggesting that it’s not some fly-by-night operation. Still, I’d love to see more transparency here in the future—it always builds more trust.

## How Does Matrix Code Edge Work?

Matrix Code Edge uses **AI algorithms** to scan the crypto market in real time. It looks for trends, price movements, and trading signals that could indicate a good opportunity. When it spots one, it can automatically place a trade on your behalf.

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- You set your trading preferences (like risk level, limit orders, etc.).
- The software scans the market 24/7.
- It identifies potentially profitable trades.
- It executes those trades instantly—faster than a human could.

It also includes a **demo mode**, so you can test things out without using real money. This is great for getting comfortable with the system before diving in with real funds.

## Matrix Code Edge Pros and Cons

Let’s keep it real. No platform is perfect. Here’s what I found:

**Pros:**

- **Beginner-friendly** interface
- Fast, AI-powered trade execution
- Supports multiple asset types (crypto, stocks, forex)
- Includes a demo account for practice
- **Mobile accessible** via browser
- 24/7 customer support

**Cons:**

- Lack of transparency about the developers
- No dedicated mobile app (just browser-based)
- Like all trading, there's **risk of loss**
- Not available in some regions (like the U.S.)

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, but you should go in knowing that **there's no such thing as guaranteed profits**—even with AI.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Matrix Code Edge?

Matrix Code Edge is **web-based**, which means it works on pretty much any device with a browser:

- Desktop (Windows/macOS)
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Smartphone (iOS/Android)

No need to download anything. I tested it on my phone and laptop, and the interface adjusted smoothly. Still, it would be cool to see a dedicated mobile app in the future for push notifications and quicker access.

Matrix Code Edge is available in most parts of the world, including:

- **UK**
- **Australia**
- **Canada**
- **Germany**
- **South Africa**
- **New Zealand**
- **Latin American countries**

Unfortunately, it’s not currently available in the **United States**, which is a bummer if you're based there. This is likely due to strict financial regulations.

## Matrix Code Edge – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform's AI crunches **real-time data** from multiple sources to spot market trends as they happen. This helps users avoid emotional trading and instead rely on data-driven decisions.

Perfect for beginners, but also customizable for power users.

### Mobile Accessibility

Matrix Code Edge works seamlessly through your **mobile browser**, so you can check your trades, make adjustments, or withdraw profits while on the go.

Whether you're a passive observer or an active trader, this feature helps you stay in the loop.

This means you can diversify your trades and reduce risk, all from the same platform.

## Is Matrix Code Edge a Scam?

Short answer: **Doesn’t seem like it**.

I couldn’t find any major red flags that scream “scam.” The platform is transparent about the risks, offers a demo mode, and doesn’t promise overnight riches (thankfully). 

That said, always approach new platforms with caution. Start with the **minimum deposit**, test the features, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Matrix Code Edge?

The required minimum deposit is **$250**. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this. 

This deposit is used as your **trading capital**, not a fee. You can start trading as soon as the funds hit your account.

You’ll be matched with a partnered broker. Verify your identity (standard KYC process), then deposit at least $250 to activate your account.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can choose to **trade manually or activate the automated mode**. I recommend starting with demo mode to get a feel for the platform before going live.

1k27470,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k27470/aita_for_defendinf_my_fiance_and_not_giving_up/,AITA for defendinf my fiance and not giving up our ground anymore?,"Hi, my name is Kate and I'm 30 years old. My fiance (30) has a mother who is becoming more and more unbearable. I want to ask the reddit users if I'm so terrible for defending myself and my partner. The situation is like this. (I apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language.)  
Before Christmas (about a month before), we called his mother to see if she wanted to come with her husband for Christmas. His mother is 60 years old this year. That's when they told us they couldn't, that they had arranged with her ex-husband to visit him. Yes, I know how strange it sounds. She and her husband are best friends with her ex-husband. After a week, we called them again to see if they wanted to come at least for coffee in the afternoon. Especially since her ex-husband lives two doors down in the block of flats next to us.

Last week, she and us called again that we were going on a trip to see my family there on Saturday morning and back on Sunday early evening. The conversation on the phone was exceptionally pleasant and we ended it saying that after Christmas we would visit her and give her birthday presents or go to her ex-husband home and wish her a happy birthday there. After an hour from the end of the call, her husband texted my fiance something like this: How can you allow yourself to treat your mother like this? You're crazy, you treat her terribly and she's supposed to be 60. We're not at home for you, so don't call us and don't visit us.

My fiance wanted to reply to this message to her husband, but before he could, my mother's husband blocked him on Facebook from where he wrote to him. We immediately called him and wanted to ask what was going on. Instead, he picked it up and immediately put it down. We let the situation calm down, I thought it would calm down like all these manipulative episodes of hers. Instead, a few days later, she wrote this in short: I don't want any handouts and a loving play. We live twenty minutes from you, but you don't come, and if you do, you rush back home and only stay for a while. And that you need to rest after work? I won't be here forever and you act like this. You are a snob and behave terribly. You said yourself that you have a new family. So don't bother.

To put things in perspective. I am a teacher and my partner works 12 hour shifts at work. My fiance's mother still complains that we don't visit her enough. We visit my family 4 times a year, always for 2 to 3 days. There is no other way because of work. We go to his mother's house at least once a month, and during the summer break this year we visited their garden at least 6 times. His mother has health problems with her spine and is at risk of two surgeries. She was on drips and taking many medications. I understand that she is worried about her health, but she is exaggerating. Every time we want to come to them, she starts making excuses for not coming. For example: Don't drive Kate works in education. (Children have germs.) Don't go, we're not well. Don't go, you were on a trip in a bigger city and you will bring covid home to us. Etc.

On the other hand, she constantly blames us for not going to see them, when they themselves prevent us from doing so, and when we invite them, they don't come even though they are two doors away. We didn't do anything to them and yet we are always the bad ones. Even after we both celebrated our thirtieth birthdays this year. My fiance had a party planned that got canceled three times because of them. First because they were sick, second because mother's husband went to work abroad (they had debts and needed money) and third because they couldn't make it that weekend. Eventually we gave up and stopped asking. On my birthday they were invited to my family for a family celebration of my thirtieth birthday. A few days before leaving, they called us that mother's husband had health problems and they could not go with us. It even pissed me off and I'm a pretty calm person. They were supposed to go on vacation a week later. The day before leaving for my family, we went to their garden and asked them how they were doing and so on. We were told that on Friday (the day of my our travel) they would bring pebbles between the flower beds and that she and her husband would somehow transfer it to the flower beds. And again we were the bad ones for not helping them because we were going away. In the end, their vacation didn't work out because their dog got sick. (My fiance sad me that it was carma. :D)Ever since I met his mother, her health has gradually deteriorated and even her doctor has prescribed medication to calm her mental state. (She didnt take it.) She hasn't had an easy life, I understand that, but she can't treat us like this and expect us to shut up and not fight back.

Today, despite their warning (we are not at home for you), we went to wish her a happy birthday. We wrote to her that we were waiting in the parking lot and if we could come. We were actually standing below the house and waiting for what she would write. We heard the text ringing on her cell phone through the open window. They were at home, there was a light. We heard them talking about it upstairs, and after about 5 minutes, a text message written by her husband arrived saying they were not at home. (We recognized it because it was written in his language. He is from a different country than us.) We collected about $130 worth of gifts and went home. My fiancé couldn't stand it at home and wrote to her husband that he was writing to his mom and not to him and why is he still answering messages for her. And then he blocked his number to repay him for blocking him on Facebook. We went to see a netflix movie and that's when I started getting messages on my cell phone.

She wrote to me how can we afford to treat her husband like this and who wrote the SMS. That now they are arguing at home about it and that she wasn't home. She said she was at the pharmacy for her medication and he wrote the message for her. That she is not well, etc. Instead, I looked at her stories on Facebook, how she is smiling with a cake, taking pictures of a flower and a gift from him and looking very well and not sick as she constantly writes to us. During our relationship with them, we found out that his mother lies very often and chooses when she has time and when she doesn't want to go or do anything. We figured it about her due to the fact that when she was with my fiance's brother and his girlfriend she was gossiping about us and when she was with us she was gossiping about them She just didn't understand that we were having fun together and we would tell each other everything. She slandered her brother's girlfriend that she was a gold digger and that her son was under her influence. On the other hand, his mother claimed that I made up my nut allergies. (I choke and throw up after eating nuts and have other food allergies.) That I don't clean and my house is a mess and the worst part is that I'm fat. After my knee injury I gained 20 kilos and unfortunately I am not that lucky to lose it even if I try.

After I defended myself for the first time and shoved it in her face very politely that even if we try, we are still the bad ones and that we want to visit them but they always discourage us, she was silent for a while and then started again. No confession I did this and that. Instead, the same again, who wrote the message and how can we insult her husband like this. At the same time, he was the first to write us and threaten us not to go to them. Subsequently, I objected that half of the things she says are not even true, that they have changed and not us, and I have no idea what happened. And that if she wants something to my fiancé, she should write to me, because she is hurting him and I will not allow her to treat him like this. Subsequently, about an hour later, she wrote to my fiance this: Since you have been with Kate, you have changed and you are acting rudely to them. I hope you are not unreasonable and you can have comunicate with me as much as you want.

When threats didn't work, she tried questions, and when those didn't work either, she tried to destroy or disrupt our relationship. So what do you guys think. Am I really that terrible for standing up to this callous and toxic mother?

Thank you for any advice and ideas on how to get out of this hell and not be a moron with your ears down.

UPDATE 1: DAY AFTER

When my fiance's mother couldn't handle the abusive messages to me, she decided to write to my fiance. She wrote to him that since he's been with me he's been rough and heartless and that he's never been like that. Ever since he started being with me. At the same time, last year at Christmas, when my fiance proposed to me, she forced herself into our house so that she could be at the proposal. To which my fiance finally nodded just to keep the piece. He originally wanted to propose to me alone by the Christmas tree in the evening. He even asked my family if he could marry me, which is the nicest thing he could do for me. He asked my mom and her husband (he's not my biological father but it's like he is) and he even asked my grandmother.

Update 2: (christmas day 24.12) My fiance's mother started writing to him at 6:30 in the morning! She knew he would be leaving work and texted him letter after letter until he answered. She asked him if he should really write to me about everything she wants to deal with him. (When she wrote to us for the first time, I wrote to her that if she wanted to solve something, she should write to me, because I will not allow her to keep hurting her son like this stupidly. Basically, I did the same as her husband. and then she started writing to me: Where I take this right to write her like this and that and thqt she can write as she wants to her son. She asked him about writing to him and she even said I should calm down, because she is not some kido from my school. (I work as a teacher.) My fiance then wrote to her that she can write to him but he doesn't want to see her husband in his life anymore.

It's interesting that her husband can write for her to us, but as soon as I do the same, she starts writing to me that my fiance is a self-righteous person and I don't have the right to write for him. A double standard indeed.

What can we do to fix her? Because I'm starting to think that the biggest evil is her husband and he's trying to cut her off from her children just as he is from his own.

UPDATE 2: YESTERDAYS NIGHT

The future ex-mother-in-law is working her magic again. Last night, at half past eight in the evening, we were approached with screenshots from Facebook. The fiance's mother screened my mom's facebook and sent it to us. My mom shared a lot of things on her profile yesterday. A few quotes about how women have a hard time in life, something about healthy pride, a parrot stuffing flowers between its feathers and an article about the bad behavior of mothers and how they can cause mental blocks for their children in the future, etc. It was all public, no one singled anyone out anywhere, especially since my mom is quite a fan of psychology and is very committed to raising me and my younger brother well to be good in life.

When my fiance asked her what to do, she snapped at him that it was all aimed at her and the quotes my mom shared and that she would not allow herself to be publicly humiliated. I repeat once again, no one tagged anyone anywhere and what my mom shares is a classic of probably every fifty-year-old mother with access to the Internet. In short everything she likes and shares is this: jokes, parrots because she has one at home, satire, psychology and quotes. I think that the content of her profile is very innocent considering today's conditions and the semi-current situation in our country.

Even though we wrote to her that no one is tagging her anywhere and it's just sharing things that she just likes, she couldn't tell. If she looked back at her profile a day later, she would find very similar things to what she shared there yesterday. But I think she's just looking for any excuse to fight.

Finally, after three hours of writing, we learned that if we don't go to rewrite the car we bought from them a month ago, immediately when her husband says it, he will report us to the police for theft or preventing the rewriting of the car. And at that moment, the smiles faded even for us. until then we had been joking about that loud scream of hers into the dark.

We ended up making an appointment for next week and luckily I will be able to be there because my fiance is afraid that her husband is going to throw dirt on him and school him there about some non-existent bad behavior towards his mother. Especially when the only one causing problems here is him. In addition, if anything were to happen, I have a cell phone and pepper spray with me and I'm not afraid to use it. Thank goodness for self defense classes with the local police for our entire teaching staff last year. If anything physical were to happen, I know how to proceed with a calm head and I know what to do. During the course, they taught us directly abouut very unpleasant situations they put us in them and I know what to expect.

Mini update this morning: I learned this morning that she wrote to my mom under the post that she should sweep her own doorstep and should re-educate her daughter (me). In addition, my mother wrote to her what she meant by that and why she was publicly attacking her out of nowhere. And his mother wrote that my mom has problems in her marriage at home and when she solves it she can talk about other people. And then she blocked my mom. All I can say is that my mom and her husband had only one disagreement and that was that he is a workaholic and was hardly home when mom moved in with him after marriage. Since then, they get along very well, a bump here and there, but that's normal after all. That's the only thing the ex mother in law knew, and she immediately wanted to use it as a weapon. In addition, my mother only knows that we are at odds and it is not thanks to us, unfortunately, and that my fiance is very sorry about what is happening with his mother. I understand that she has health problems in her life, but I'm afraid that it's starting to get on her mind.

What do you guys think is the best? My fiance is shocked that his own mother is capable of such horrible things and he never thought in his life that she could do such a thing to his own son. I am 100% in favor of ending contact with her and especially her husband. I don't know what we will do with all the presents we bought for them for Christmas and her 60th birthday are stil unopen at our home, but this is really too much even for me. How can a mother harm her own child like this?

UPDATE: TODAY 18.4.2025:

Hello dear people of reddit. I didn't think I would write an update, but hey, here we are again! Today my ""mother-in-law's"" ex-husband came to visit us. My fiancé had a birthday yesterday and wanted to wish him a happy birthday. In short, I can only say that my ""mother-in-law"" has turned him into another weapon and the poor guy doesn't even know about it. He basically started attacking my fiancé, demanding to know what they did to each other. My fiancé just took a deep breath and repeated everything that happened, how they threatened him with the police about the car we bought from them, how we were at their place and wanted to wish my ""mother-in-law"" a happy birthday and they pretended not to be home and texted us ""We're not home."" Even though we were standing outside the door and could hear them they were home. The best part is that the ""mother-in-law"" now came out with the idea that my mother (the nicest person on the planet, who would give herself away even if she had nothing) had written to her saying that she was a toxic mother. And I was pissed off too. Even though I'm normally a very calm person. 

We both turned to him and said that on the contrary, she was the one who went after my mother's public post on Facebook, that my mother should re-educate me and that she also has problems at home in her marriage, etc. The post was about her work, because she also works in education (as me) and is an assistant to a little boy who has toxic parents. Under it, the ""mother-in-law"" started posting all this nonsense here and publicly attacking my mother. No one ever tagged the ""mother-in-law"" anywhere and never responded to her at all. I have no idea where this anger could come from in her and what happened to her. But I'm proud of my future husband for telling him that until his mother apologizes to him, there will be no resolution or relationship. That it's not our fault and that we tried hard. And we overlooked a lot of things I can say A LOOOOT. I don't know what to do about this, I don't want my fiancé to lose his mother, but at the same time I'm not going to crawl in front of her and ask for forgiveness when it's her fault. We want to get married this summer and I'm thinking about sending her an invitation by mail. But only for her and not for her husband. My fiancé never wants to see him again. I almost forgot, they said the threat to call the police was just that and they didn't mean it that way at all. I don't know about other countries, but in our country this is taken quite seriously and threatening the police is not just like that.

It just so happens that while Arabic is a beautiful language for culture and conversations, it's also the foundation of Islam. 

The Qur'an, Hadith, Tafsir, and classical books are all in Arabic. Imagine reading the exact words revealed to the Prophet ﷺ, not just someone’s interpretation of them.Learning Fusha Arabic has helped me to look at the text outside of my native language, as any translations and interpretations will not always convey the true meaning.

Jumping into the translation aspect, there's nothing wrong with reading the Quran or any other text in your own language.But as a Muslim, I wouldn't be living up to my full potential if I didn't tell you that there are more rewards in reading or reciting in Arabic. A hadith states that whoever reads a letter from the Quran will receive a reward, and that reward will be multiplied by ten.

One word in Arabic can have multiple layers of meaning that can get lost in translation. Understanding the differences and context can help you view the Quran in a different way.An example I used to struggle with before learning Fusha were similar-sounding words but differed with similar letters. Qalb (قلب) means heart while Kalb (كلب) means dog. Simple change, but big effect.

We all struggle with Kushoo in salah. I'm guilty of it every day. ""Why did John Cena turn bad?"" or ""Which coffee should I drink today?"".We forget Salah is a deep conversation with Allah. Dua's hit harder when you understand what your asking for. Surah's you've memorized from a young age take on a whole new meaning.I've known a number of surahs for years but never truly understood what I was saying.

Learning Arabic can definitely enhance your understanding of the Quran. However, simply learning Arabic may not be sufficient to fully understand the Quran in its entirety.If you're able to understand the majority of what you're reading and any recitations, this will help strengthen your deen, promote spiritual growth and improve your relationship with Allah.

I'm far from fluent, but 30-60 minutes a day alongside the Quran has done wonders for picking up new words and understanding the grammar structure.",3,1744988613.0,MuslimCorner,3,1.0,False

It’s all downhill from here.” But it never got any easier. The +16,000 ft [4,876 m] passes kept coming.

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina. Two days of pavement felt like a luxury. I found kiwi fruits in a small village called Susques and thought I was hallucinating. Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.

I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.

Daylight cratered fast in the valley below, as did its frigid temps. I raced south toward lower elevations to camp for the night. More inescapable desert and rusted canyons.

My room was very elegant, simple and minimal; there was not much furniture but everything was enough. The cleaning staff meticulously organized the room every day. The buffet was organized in such a way that you could eat comfortably without overcrowding. The food was light, delicious and attentive. The spa is like a sanctuary for those looking for tranquility. I tried the hot stone massage and felt completely refreshed afterwards. The hammam and sauna were hygienic and quiet. The beach was another world; I spent hours with the sound of the waves, one can't help but meditate. I took my coffee in the hotel garden and sat there for hours. Instead of live music, there was light jazz and nature sounds in the evenings. No one even made eye contact with anyone else and enjoyed their vacation, this environment impressed me a lot. The approach of the staff was also very kind and attentive. The landscaping in the hotel was also very careful; the walkways, resting benches, everything seemed designed for meditation.

### Background
Male, late twenties, 170lbs. Have completed 2 marathons previously; first marathon was in Nov. 2023 was just to take part and did not complete any serious training, I finished in 4 hrs 5 mins. 2nd marathon took place in Spring 2024. I did a full 16 week block and achieved a chip time of 3:23.

### Training
I followed a 20-week block and used the Runna app. Having used it before, I found it convenient and it seemed to track well with other plans based on the mileage. I ran x5 per week, hitting ~85KM in the peak weeks. Weeks consisted of x2 Easy runs, x2 speed/track workouts and x1 long run. Easy runs started in the early weeks around 8KM and built up to 14KM in the peak weeks. Speed workouts were performed mainly at a local 400m track; 400m repeats, mile repeats, Tempo runs. Long runs alternated from easy pace runs to quicker/marathon pace efforts.

Training for the most part went well. There were a few times where life got in the way and had to hack together some runs in sub-optimal conditions, but I believe still showing up and getting it done is where some of the magic lies. No injuries to deal with. Kept up gym training (bodybuilding style training) most weeks that came in the format of x2 Upper and x2 Lower days per week. 

### Taper
I struggled a lot in the final 4 weeks of the block (2 weeks training and 2 weeks of taper). Sleep was poor, fed up with training and just not feeling buzzed at all. My previous marathon was far different, there was a steady increase in anticipation towards race day, but this time, I was so sick of it all. It seemed to start with one of my long runs 5 weeks from race day. The goal was 28K long run but barely managed to scrape past 23K. Multiple bathroom breaks (never happened before), sore legs, tiredness - from this run I never really seemed to get the spark back until race day.

My taper was fairly lacklustre. I only completed 2/4 runs in the first week of the taper and decided at this point I would prioritise recovery and rest - I figured I had most of the hard work done at this point.

My main goal for the race was to come in at least faster than my previous marathon (3:23), but was more aiming for sub-3:20. However, based on the last ~4 weeks of not feeling great, I wasn't really sure where I would end up. Having to travel for this marathon added a bit to the stress and anxiety around my performance. Are you seriously traveling for a marathon when you might not actually perform well? All this effort but to be in worse shape? These were some of the negative questions swimming around my head, but I pressed on.

I focused on lots of carbs, water and electrolytes from the Wednesday before the race.

My final training run was the Wednesday before the race. However, my lower back got very numb & tight. I had to stop multiple times to stretch it out. Was I cooked? This had never happened before. Did I not warm up correctly? Why does it have to happen now, so close to race day?

### Pre-race
Arrived in Vienna on Friday evening and head straight to the hotel. Ate a ""healthy"" McDonalds on Friday night, as there were no other food options open. I told myself to just get as much sleep as possible that night, as I knew from experience that the Saturday night sleep would likely be worse. Left the hotel at 1pm on Saturday, headed to the expo to pick up my race number. Then headed back to the hotel but stopped in a supermarket and picked up lots of fresh bread rolls (avoided the crap imported American bagels, I think this was a good move), water, bananas, caramel stroopwaffles, Tuc Crackers, greek yogurt, a protein bar and some chocolate croissants. Dropped the food back to the hotel and went for a very leisurely 3K shakeout around 4pm on Saturday. Straight back to the hotel, shower and began eating the groceries from earlier.

I had to check out the following morning as I was returning to my home city on Sunday evening so I packed my bags up and had everything ready to go on Saturday night. Lay the race outfit, gels & shoes on the floor and continued eating and chilled until about 11pm when I tried to sleep. Probably didn't end up falling asleep until 1am.

### Race Morning
Woke up at 6:30am and immediately ate a fresh bread roll, banana, stroopwaffle,  electrolytes and coffee. Went for a quick 10 minute stroll outside at 7am to help with the digestion. Came back to the hotel, proceeded to check out and locked my luggage in the hotel storage. Took my race bag, cracked a Redbull and walked to the subway station. The start line was a station 3 stops away so no crazy journey required, thankfully. However, we had to depart the train one stop short as the next station was full. This was a slight issue for me as the bag drop point was at the other station and my starting corral was at the opposite end - this meant walking down to the bag drop and walking all the way up past the other groups to my starting group. Queued for the bathroom from 8:40am and just about made it into the corral at about 8:58am. No real warm up was done.


### Race
Just after 9am, we set off across the Reichsbrücke Bridge. It was a cold morning, with temperatures around 0 celsius. I knew my target pace was between 4:25-4:30 per KM in order to achieve a 3:06-3:10 race so I stuck around that. My plan was to take a gel every 6K. The first 6K went well, as did the next 6K. No mysterious back pain at all, thankfully. By the time 18K came around, I needed a port-a-loo badly - nothing crazy but I just don't understand how some people don't need one for the full 42KM. Thankfully, one appeared at the 20K mark and made the pitstop. I garnered some new-found energy after this and made good progress up to 28K. I knew from experience that the real race starts from 30/32K onwards. The first 25K should have been fine, and it was. I entered the pain cave around 33K. However the great crowds and buzz really helped me push through. I kept telling myself to just get to 38K. From then onwards, you're so close. 38K came, the crowds got louder and I went for it. As you can see from my splits, I really pushed up the pace from this point. I was cautious to do this earlier, as I didn't want to jump the gun too early.

I knew from my paces that I was on track for a PR - my previous marathon was averaging 4:49min/km so I was well on track but I wasn't sure by how much. 

### Post-race
Beers and food


### Final Thoughts
Very happy with this new PR. After a very tough ~5 previous weeks, I was unsure of where my performance was at. It would have been crushing to have not gotten a PR or performed well, especially after the time commitment, the travel expense and some of the other opportunities I had said no to because of this marathon training.

Based on my report, what might you see as some key areas to improve come the next race? What might be something that you think I can target more?

### Things that Worked for Me
Run without music - I know the running highs are amazing with the tunes going, but there is something so empowering and therapeutic about being alone with your thoughts. AFAIK, some races don't allow headphones. And it's just one more thing to worry about on race morning - what if you lose the headphones/forget to charge them/drop that after the 1st KM? Prepare your mind & body to work hard without the help of music.

Showing up even when conditions/mind/body aren’t feeling it are immeasurably better than putting it off to tomorrow.

Training legs at the gym - specifically calf raises, leg curls & hamstring curls definitely made my legs bigger, stronger and more capable of dealing with the pavement pounding.


### My Questions
After completing two marathons with the Runna app, I feel I'm ready to graduate to Pfitzinger/Higdon/Jack Daniels. Based on my level, what might you think I should aim for?

I have no other marathons scheduled for now - I'd like a break! But I'm tempted by focusing on a shorted distance (5K or 10K) as something to aim for. However, I could see my next marathon being late 2025 or Spring 2026.

1k26x0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1k26x0h/frustration/,Frustration,"I'm the spouse of an RSO, in Tennessee.
We are senior citizens. He's in yr 1 of 4 yrs of probation (only, no prison)

I have been planning for a total knee replacement since his sentencing last year, putting it off til life was settled.

His PO is well aware of his health issues and now mine as he is my sole family member/caregiver in this state. It will occur next week.

I had the option of outpatient surgery center 90 minutes away (surrounded by exclusion zones) OR hospital with overnight stay. 

Hospital is 90 minutes from home--not in an exclusion zone.
The latter is the plan--old, anesthesia, fall risk etc and insurance approved.

We also reserved a hotel room, also not in exclusion zones (she has the addresses) for.my one night hospital stay so he doesn't have to make multiple long drives. We have no way of knowing precise timing because of course; it's surgery.

He had his FaceTime phone meeting with his PO and now we find out he cannot stay in the waiting room while I am in surgery per her ""interpretation"" of rules/policies, procedures we cannot find/obtain a copy of. 

He can ask.for.an early check in at hotel but if they require me to show up ~530 a.m. that's clearly not available as an option.

I'm so hopping mad and disappointed that she (PO) said nothing til yesterday. Also, her ""partner"" got promoted and now she has a doubled case load. Totally unfair and unacceptable treatment of her; but I digress.

She's supposed to do a home visit and another FaceTime visit by the 30th...at my request he did ask her to be considerate of the fact that I will be more or less completely dependent on him for getting on /off toilet and showering at least the 1st week, maybe 2. I really hope they can give me the privacy to heal at least the 1st week. I can just imagine he's got me in the shower or on the toilet and they show up...she sounded like she listened & was sympathetic but who the hell knows.

I'm trying really hard to make this not about blaming--him, the PO, the ""system"" 
But it's also the absolute lack of any system of being able to read and know the rules TNDOC operates under. I get the notion that other government agencies have transparency; seems to be missing here. And I get some.of it is left to the interpretation of the PO. 

He's certain he'll be just fine doing multiple road trips that day. I feel like I cannot focus on my own real medical, physical and emotional needs at this point. I have to keep going back to my 3 things (coffee, dog, mother nature, & good insurance, well-respected competent surgeon) to calm myself, yet the foreboding is still there.

Part of my brain says loud and clear, hey, you signed up for this....part of me wants to keep, part of me wants to scream into the void.

And so....for those of you who are in my role as the support person--I see you, I feel you. This is why journaling, therapy, finding gratitude in the smallest of things, is so key to keeping a life balance, even when it goes sideways. To those who have questions about the long road ahead--you are not wrong or mean or a failure.if you cannot see yourself in this role for decades to come. This happened late in our lives/marriage and we were essentially in our final chapters. It is a significantly different scenario for younger folks. You are entitled to decide what your best life looks like for you.

I have always been a ""social justice"" kind of person and as I heal physically in the coming weeks, and regain my physical strength, I will still continue to pursue what SOR reforms should look like in a just and merciful society. I will continue to use available bandwidth to learn more.on the topic and determine where my time and energy can be of use. And I will, presumably, be grateful I awaken and there's dog and coffee and Mother Nature

Nothing tremendous, but things like a 2-5-10% resistance to specific types of damage, a ""glove box"" storage to keep stuff in, small capacity increases to the battery and fuel tanks, better suspension to reduce fall damage, stronger brakes for faster stops, and so on...

Thought up some more: Car tuning so the car gets a minor horsepower upgrade,  fuel can pump speed increases, Car shifter and ignition speed increases...

More Cosmetic/quality of life options: I'd like the option to roll down the windows, so that you can blast music when outside of the car, you could scan anomalies without getting out, and you could fire off a flare gun to distract hostile anomalies. The car needs mud flaps, floor mats, and custom rims for the wheels! There should be more Cosmetic options for the garage, specifically for the storefront room, let us clean out the area and adding, say, amenities? A bed that lets you pass time, a vending machine that dispenses materials of your choice for anchor energy, and repurposing that extra computer so you can write your own ""quests"". A ""power tool"" station that speeds up car part installation and removal. An arcade cabinet with some basic games you can play (pong, snake, etc? It's the late 80's, there should be SOME arcade stuff!). A set of chairs/couches you can place around the garage that can be interacted with so you can idle. A radio or two that can be installed outside or in the storefront. A ""dumpster diver"" upgrade to the friendly dumpster that catches the stuff it throws out.

More rack/seat/roof attachments: a back seat storage compartment, a power generator that you can feed fuel into to charge your battery, ""shells"" that provide extra hit points and are damaged prior to other car parts, a ""ballast balloon"" rack part that lightens the car passively for better air time and reduced fall damage...

Larger power generators that fit on the roof! A power-fuel storage seat component that gives a smaller amount of each resource. An ""anomaly detector"" rack part, and a ""Anchor Radar"" one too. 

More car parts: All-Season tires which have B rank across the board and are available after summer tires. ""Everyman"" Panels and Doors, which has a 5% or 10% resistance to all damage types. Shuttered Headlights, which increases the width of the headlights but makes them have worse range, and Low Power Headlights I and II, both are 1/5th the power cost, version 1 is fragile and weak ranged, while version 2 is average overall but expensive. A snow plow Bumper, which has a massive amounts of hit points and can tank impact damage, but slows the car down. Tracked Tires, specifically designed for climbing inclines. Ultralight Panels, which speed up the car but are fragile. Spiked panels and doors, which are theft-proof, and can't be attached to by anomalies.

""Survival"" aspects: introduce hunger and sleep mechanics (thirst wouldn't work as well?), in that travelling between zones eats up canned food and MREs but gives extra health past 100%, while the driver gets sleepier the longer the drive goes on, with 6 hours adding ""eye strain"", 9 hours causes a ""blinking"" visual distraction, and 12+ hours causes second-long ""blackouts"". During expeditions, the pit stops would include a bed to restore sleep and a refrigerator for food.

Add additional food resources: coffee, cans of soda, and energy drinks makes you sprint faster and alleviates sleepiness by varying degrees, Snack Cakes regenerate health very slowly but give a decent amount back, Mushrooms mitigate rad damage, while Cooked Marsh eggs (throw a marsh egg into electricity?) mitigates acid damage.",4,1744988080.0,pacificDrive,0,1.0,False

I am currently laying in bed and have been since about an hour after taking this medication due to nausea and an almost dizzying tiredness. I got sick and couldn’t make it to the bathroom had to get sick in my coffee cup (I drink decaf to trick my brain as I originally was a coffee nut).

I’ve also felt shaky and on and off hot and cold. Fighting between being under my blanket and ripping it off me. 

I guess I’m just wondering how this was for other pregnant women that may have started in their third trimester as well?

I know there are risks also, but I wouldn’t be taking this medication if I wasn’t so seriously worried about my mental health pregnant with my beautiful boy. 

I’ve gone over 7 years unmedicated dealing with my mental health problems…which is a pretty decent sized list of diagnosis… if I wasn’t truly getting terrified of not taking this med I wouldn’t be on it at all. 

I plan to possibly stop once we are situated in a place that isn’t filled with toxicity, and I know I can be in the comfort of my own home without worrying about mental verbal or emotional distress caused by my mother in law. 

Typically my triggers are well managed without, as I’ve spent years working on my trauma, but she’s an alcoholic and triggers alot of old wounds and abuse I endured from a young child until my earlier 20’s. 

(I am 26 now)

If anyone has any advice on how to help these side effects, stories on how it was when they started, really just any helpful information I’d greatly appreciate it. Anything to help manage this while I work on it getting into my system enough that it starts to work. 

I’m already so pregnant and tired and get little to no rest with my living situation at the moment, I just want to try and ease into this as smoothly as possible and start to feel normal again for my sons sake and mine.

I’m working on a dark fantasy novel, and I’d like to hear your thoughts on the first chapter. The story follows Erevos, a wandering adventurer on a quest for power and knowledge in a world where every god in history is real and anyone can make a pact with them to gain magic.


                                CHAPTER ONE

     Despite the howling winds of the snow blizzard engulfing him, Erevos strained to catch the faint sound of hooves upon the snow-covered ground. Alongside with the subtle sway of the horse's movement and the relative safety of the ragged, long forgotten path he was on, it allowed him to think of what this world used to be. Centuries or maybe millennia ago a cataclysmic event, probably fueled by the then newfound access to magic gifted by one of the numerous gods depending to which one someone worshipped, lead to the destruction of the civilization back then. Glancing back at his loyal black wolf, faithfully tracing the horse's steps, he got himself lost in thought. 


     When he started this journey, some 6 years ago at the age of 19, his first lead was an abandoned mine deep in the mountains of Cartha of the Slova Kingdom, a week north of his home town on foot which was located on the shores of the Medinean sea. What he sought was neither gold or gems nor some forgotten get-rich-artifact, but, strangely, a library constructed deep within the mine. The path leading to the entrance was almost destroyed. Since it was abandoned close to a century ago, no caravan or mine workers had passed through to clear it of the debris created by the occasional rockslide, the winter blizzards and the autumn rainstorms. Fortunately for him the boulders, fallen trees and any damaged parts of the path didn't stand in his way. Although he was of medium height and build, he was agile and strong enough to pass through any obstacles with relative ease. 


     Reaching the mine's entrance he didn't found himself in awe as he expected, instead of a magical gate with words in a strange language that he needed to speak aloud, the entrance was simply curved into the stone and it's walls and ceiling were supported by wooden beams that no miner would trust anymore after a century of being unkempt. He didn't either but with a goal in mind and a grant appetite for knowledge he lit up a torch and entered. 


     Backing away from the thoughts of the past due to his stomach reminding him that he had not eaten since morning, he thought it would be best to have a short break, before the sun settled for the night, not only for him to eat but for the horse and wolf to rest too. Picking a spot between two trees, he quickly tied the horse to a nearby tree and pulled out a simple tarp and rope from his magically endless backpack and hang it between them against the continuing storm, nailing the hanging end to the ground making a shed. It just had to be enough so he could sustain a small fire. After picking up some fallen branches and searching his backpack for some dry twigs and his trusty firestarter, a travelling merchant gifted him long ago, he sat down, placed his two long swords from his hip to his side, ignited the twigs and placed them under the branches. He decided some of yesterday's grilled meat and a cup of coffee would be perfect for this short break.


      Having eaten and taking a sip of coffee, he took the swords and placed them so the tip of their scabbard was in the ground and the hilts to his left shoulder and held the cup of coffee with both hands to warm them up. He always used to sit like that, it comforted him, especially when in the wilds thus making sure his swords were not only safe but also easily available. 


     These particular swords he got only a couple of years ago, he adored them and took care of them with every chance he got. He had to save up quite a sum of gold to have them custom crafted from materials he gathered over the years. The first one was what the master blacksmith called a hybrid, it's core was of flexible steel to absorb impacts, the edge was of an alloy, only possible with magic from a Hephaestus worshipper, of titanium and black gold harvested from a meteor. Between them the black steel brought balance between the hard but fragile edge and the flexible core. Once it was forged in fire, it was quenched in various oils and a heavily enchanted by an Ogma worshipper. The process turned the blade pitch black, so much so that one would think it actually absorbed the light rather than reflect it. He chose not to decorate the sword as most would do for a blade of such craftsmanship, the dark wood hilt was simple as was the guard. The only thing he asked, was for the pommel to be sharpish so that was perfect for smashing it to flesh and bone when needed. The other blade was made of a steel alloy, coated in a layer of silver and enchanted. Usually monster hunters carried such blades in order to kill creatures that the silver would poison, crippling them and ultimately killing them. While he had killed various monsters over the years, he was no hunter, he had the blade made for reasons he would rather not think of anymore. 


     Sipping some more of his coffee he hugged the blades and cup tightly, closed his eyes and emptied his mind to get some rest. 


     Minutes later the galloping of a dozen horses brought him back to full consciousness. He found it strange that the path he was on was used by someone else too, maybe the bartender he got some information and directions from was mistaken or lied which made him think what else of everything he told him was true. He felt that whomever they were, posed no threat and so did his horse and wolf, the first continued to eat some vegetables and fruits he left for it in a bowl and the other didn't even acknowledged them and stayed tucked close to the fire. Moments later, he could see them from the corner of his eye. A woman in shining light armor stood out amongst a dozen knights. She must have been someone important in order to have such an escort, he thought. The antithesis between her decorated, regal looking armor and the heavy armor of the battle-hardened knights as well as the fact she was circled by them enforced that thought. His suspicions turned out to be true when she called for them to stop once she saw him and despite of the warnings from her escorts she climbed off her horse.


""My lady, we shouldn't stop. The storm will grow stronger before it subsides. We must make haste to the next town."" one of the knights, probably the captain, called out. 


""I will only be a minute!"" she simply said in response. Dropping the hood and untying the furry collar that covered most of her head and face, she started to walk towards the sitting adventurer. 


     As she walked near him, he could see the details of her face and the armor she wore. Her long, straight blood red hair flowed in the violent wind and revealed her youthful pale face. Her eyes where the same color as her hair but more vivid and slightly glowing, accompanied by her full lips and cute nose she was simply stunning to him. Redheads were a weakness of his after all. Her silver light armor, covering her from neck to toe, was well kept, polished and followed her curves. The red accents painted on the armor, that complimented her features, and the rich dark brown fur poking out from underneath the plates together with a dark red cape completed the look of, what he thought, a warrior princess. She approached with a catlike walk that made her presence even more elegant and kneeled next to him. 


""Greetings sir. It's strange to see someone on this path, especially during the winter. Are you all right? Are you lost?"" she said in a warm tone while trying to find his eyes in the darkness that his hood and mask offered. 


The bartender wasn't mistaken after all he thought before lifting his head to meet her eyes. When he met her gaze and his mask lit up from the fire's orange light, he saw her taken back, raising her torso slightly to make some distance between them. 


     His mask and overall appearance didn't inspire friendliness, he knew that well, and reactions like hers were common to him. His mask, made of black steel, resembled a skull. It's eyes were slightly tilted in way that made them look permanently angry. The sockets were fitted with dark enchanted lenses that enable him to see better in darkness and offered a slight magnification when needed. Finally a huge, ear to ear grin with dozens, big, needle like teeth made it look even more ferocious and demonic. His total black armor didn't help either. A chainmail collar, lined in the inside with fur was attached along the edge of the mask's sharp jaw and connected to a simple form fitting breastplate. On top of his shoulders were arches that protected his neck from side swings and the plates on his arms connected with gauntlets that had sharp edges and offered protection to each finger individually with razor sharp knuckles. His waist was covered by a long chainmail coat that ended just above his knees along with a hooded, warm, black, furry, tunic like, garment beneath it. His black leather trousers were lined with light plates as were his leather boots that reached the middle of the calf. When it was cold, like now, he chose to wear a heavy cape that attached to the armor and covered him from neck to toe in a warm embrace, which he thought it made him look like a bat. Of course, he knew better than to fight in it, especially after he got ambushed by some bandits a couple of years back and didn't have time to detach it. That's why he had a craftsman modify it with quick release latches, any pull stronger than the weight of the cape when wet would immediately cause it to drop off. 


""Greetings to you too, my lady"" he answered in as a calm and friendly manner as he could ""and certainly I'm not lost. I'm travelling north, just taking a short break for my horse and wolf to rest a bit and myself to eat."" He knew that he sounded awkward, he wasn't used to chatting with strangers. All those years he travelled alone with only his wolf and occasional horse for company.



""Are you a monster hunter?"" she asked looking at his blades ""The silver one is for creatures, the iron for men. Both are for monsters kind perhaps? "" she said the line, that monster hunters used to impress women, with a masculine impression. 


He chuckled with the impression and answered ""No, just a traveler. More of an adventurer really. What about you my lady? What brings you to this path?"" 


""We came down from the Iron Castle a bit north of were we are now. I wanted to see if it is worth to rebuild the road here. It was abandoned long ago when the raising bandit and monster activity made it too dangerous to cross. Instead, people started using the longer but safe old mining road which was extended to reach the castle. It goes around that mountain, you see?"" she said raising her arm and pointing to a peak above the forest canopy.


Turning his head to meet her hand he said ""I'm aware and you shouldn't."" 


""Shouldn't what? Rebuild the road you mean?"" 


""Yeah. It's still dangerous, monsters still lurk in the Black Forest.""


""We didn't see any. Not even a single track. Captain Grumpy there used to be a hunter, he would have seen any signs of monsters."" she said while chuckling at the nickname she had given the middle aged knight. 


     Meanwhile he had taken note that his wolf had raised his head with pointy ears at full attention. Enabling the magnification on his lenses he quickly scouted the area deep in the woods. South of him and some good distance away was where he spotted 5 large creatures pursuing a Great Deer. None of the knights seemed to take notice of the commotion ahead. 


""My lady! We should really go!"" the captain said with a raised voice, grabbing the lady's and adventurer's attention. 


""If they went now they would probably cross paths with the creatures"" he immediately thought hearing the captain's insistence. 


""Not all monster lurk during this hour and some of them don't like leaving clues of their presence"" he said while she started to stand up. Before she could say anything, he continued ""Why don't you take a break here? Just for a while, ten minutes or so. I'm sure the horses would appreciate it and you can have some of this coffee from the south. I'm pretty sure you don't have it up here in the Far North"". 


""You're right. A break would be good. And. A taste of that intriguing smelling beverage would be nice."" she answered decisively after glancing back and forth the captain and him. ""Captain Arne! Get the men and horses behind some cover and come sit with us."" 


Grunting and clearly displeased with the lady's decision he dismounted and gave instructions to the rest of the knights while one of them took the reigns of his horse. 


As Captain Arne made his way to them, the masked man scooted over, making some space to his left for the lady to sit under the shed's cover. 


Seeing his gesture, she sat beside him and stretched her hands towards the small fire rubbing them together for warmth. ""We still haven't introduced. I'm Sigrun of the..."" 


""Queen Sigrun of the Iron Castle, Ruler of the North"" Captain Arne corrected her looking at her like a teacher would at his obviously mistaken student, taking a sit across them. 


""Acting! Queen."" she retorted with slight frustration ""I'm yet to be crowned and I'm sure it doesn't make a difference to a traveler who is not even a subject of mine."" 


""I'm Erevos, it's nice to meet you Queen Sigrun and Captain Arne."" he said offering his hand for a shake thus bringing their attention to him. It seemed that the argument about how she presented herself was long standing and he didn't really want to give them a chance to unfold it. 


""Nice to meet you too Erevos and please, it's just Sigrun."" she said with a pleasant smile and shook his hand. 


Captain Arne did the same and answered with a nod. 


""How about some coffee? Would you like one too Captain?"" Erevos suggested taking out of his backpack two cups. 


""Sure! I'll have some."" Sigrun said happily while Arne nodded in agreement. 


He poured them a cup and sat in silence for a moment sipping their coffees. 


""What are you looking for in this forgotten part of the North anyway?"" Arne said breaking the silence. 


""Nothing specific."" Erevos lied. He knew exactly what he was seeking and that it was in the northwestern part of the forest. He didn't exactly know where but he planned to find out by sunrise. ""I heard that the West part of the End Forest is mostly unexplored. Looking for an adventure I guess."" 


""I see. Not many with an appetite for exploration and adventure left, it's mostly about money and fame nowadays."" the captain said. 


""I don't really blame them. Most of the unexplored areas are highly volatile. Many unknown horrors out there. Do you remember that company of adventurers from a couple a years back? The stories they told? How many of them made it back?"" the Queen said in a sombre tone. 


""Tall tales I say! They probably got ambushed by a couple of bandits and didn't want to suffer the humiliation."" Arne responded. 


""Their faces showed otherwise. It doesn't matter anymore, what's left of them have all gone mad or became drunkards as far as I know."" she said in the same sombre tone gazing at the fire. 


     They continued talking for some time, about how Sigrun had recently lost her father, the late King, and why she travelled from town to town getting to know her subjects like her parents used do while Erevos shared some of his adventures. Sigrun's crowning would be held in a week's time and Erevos ended up been invited.


""We best get going."" Erevos said standing up and kicking some snow on the small fire that had almost extinguished by itself. ""The worst of the blizzard has passed. It will clear soon. Come on Phovos, get up boy!"" he continued calling for the black wolf to wake up. 


""You're right. We should be at the next town by nightfall."" the old captain commented. 


""It was a pleasure to meet you Erevos. I hope you do come to the crowning."" the soon to be Queen said, giving him a pleasant smile. 


""That depends on what adventure, or trouble, I will get myself into but I promise I will try and it was a pleasure for me too."" Erevos said while folding the tarp and putting it back to his backpack together with the rope and cups. 


     With that and after exchanging some more pleasantries, Captain Arne rounded up his men and the two parties got on their separate ways.",2,1744987688.0,fantasywriters,1,1.0,False

The good- food courts are great, lots of good stuff, clean and pleasant. Access to the airport is pretty good. General esthetics  are lovely.  Security is fast and efficient, at least for TSA pre-check. Standard doesn’t usually look like it’s too bad either. Good selection of seats with power outlets. 

The so-so. Garage parking, if they get the extra traffic they’d like to have through MCI, these spaces are going to be woefully insufficient. Lack of bathroom options on the departure level, pre-security. I have about an hour travel to get to the airport (morning, coffee- you know). I am usually hauling a hefty load of luggage that I don’t want to drag into the bathrooms clear at the back of baggage claim. Once I get them checked, it would be nice to have an option on that level before I have to go through security. Once you are through security, how does it make any sense that there are no bathrooms anywhere near the central court concessions? You have to walk 1/2 way to the end of a terminal wing. Same for water fountains

The bad - The bathrooms. Ok, I remember the bathrooms in the old airport, but improving on those disgusting holes was about as low a bar as improving on a pit toilet in a campground. For starters, there still are not enough. Any time a flight arrives, they are packed. Can they find a paper towel supplier/dispenser that doesn’t provide paper towels in little shreds? They are a mess. I’ve heard multiple occasions where kids don’t want to wash hands in those sinks because they are so damn hot. Turn it down a notch or two please. Those sink drains stink of rotten eggs and the steam wafting up from the hot water just makes that worse. More often than not towel dispensers empty or non functional and trash cans overflowing. Little shreds of paper towels everywhere. ",25,1744987627.0,kansascity,78,0.77,False

I have royally fucked up and feel disgusting. 
Background: narc mom NM, narc ex NX, new relationship RS (not a narc) - both family friends. 

I’m honestly realizing how much my NM has ruined me as a person. This is a total wake up call to get help. 

Dated NX for a while, suffered immensely and lost so much, but still civil as he is older and a longtime family friend. Absolute monster but as always, some positive traits. Still wants to get married and pressures a lot. 
Extremely similar to my mom, so I survived. Recently found out about RS and started some stalking behaviour like showing up at my house randomly, pushing his way inside, trying to push into the bathroom at my parents’ for holiday dinners, demanding I be ready to be picked up at a certain time when I have said no… super pushy.  Broken up for a year but since finding out about RS, NX has been besties with my mom even when my mom knows what he did to me (and we have fought viciously where she blames me for reacting or defending myself). Phone calls, texts, going for coffee, dinners at each others houses etc. I told RS and he was ready to defend, but I never let him to keep the peace because my mom would just call me a troublemaker. I never told anyone truly how bad NX was because he is a charming pillar of the community and I’m the crazy party girl so I would never be believed. 

RS and I got into an argument and seemingly broke up. Next day, I was mad, and actually answered one of NXs calls (no caller ID) by accident. I rejected conversation and was told not to be difficult, can’t I just be peaceful for once, etc. I was upset about RS and said sure fuck it let’s meet for a drink. Had some drinks. We had a lot of fun, easy hang out. He dropped me at home and the pressure to come inside was there, so I agreed to continue civility even though I was uncomfortable. I was tired and went to sleep. Next thing I know, I’m woken up by RS who let himself in the house and NX is on the other edge of the bed naked sleeping. NX instantly gets up and puts clothes on and panics, saying he’s sorry etc. I wasn’t panicked so I lay in bed to listen to them because we didn’t have sex and I wanted to see who’s who. Once they got out of my sight, I got up. All I could hear was NX showing our texts saying “she keeps calling me and coming over!!! I didn’t know about you bro” and RS saying he’s been my boyfriend for 9 months (not true, met 9 months ago but only kinda serious for 3). I remain calm and tell NX it’s okay, just go. He does. 

I had a birthday party to get ready for so I started, while arguing with RS. I leave to the birthday and of course, drank too much that the entire day became hazy … an issue for the upcoming interrogation. 

RS is livid, I’m calm trying to reassure him, but also remind him we broke up. He doesn’t care, and asked me why I’m with someone I hate who has been forceful and disrespectful. I try to explain that I keep it peaceful with NX to avoid my mother’s wrath - he’s not buying it. It’s back and forth, and he asked why he was in the bed with me. I said I don’t know, I went to sleep first. I told him I don’t recall and can’t confirm because the day is fuzzy from the birthday party. He asked me if he forced his way in or in the bed. 

Here is the issue. I went silent. All I could think about was not truly wanting NX in the house but sucking it up. How I wasn’t pleased to see him in my bed naked (I don’t want him in that way). How he’s recently been pushy and violating boundaries. My mind was spinning and I nodded my head yes. To me, it all felt coercive. 

That set RS off, and he fired off a nutty text to NX (from my phone as me) referencing forcing his way into my house before, and now doing it again and in the bed. Obviously this sends NX into a rage, because it sounds like I’m accusing him of something way more sinister (which is NOT TRUE and NOT OKAY). NX replies with insanity, saying he fingered me at the bar in daylight (lol) and I was naked for him at the house. He also said I wasn’t drunk so that helped my case. I knew I would never do any of that. RS goes nuts and I now spend days defending that I didn’t commit sexual acts in public or be nude in front of NX. I also clarify that physical force is not what I meant, and explain the pressure I’ve always felt to keep my mom happy with me. Even if it means tolerating bad things. 

NX is panicking at what he considers false accusations and an attack on his perfect image, and calls NM. I don’t know this and go visit her and she is cold mean silent and avoidant. I knew she knew. And in RS fits of rage, he tells me that NM also called him, told him about NXs call, says she believes him and that she’s been praying for me my whole life and get this… to tell me to block NX, leave him alone and not disturb his family (his sisters love me). Now, the vibe with RS is “even your mom thinks you’re terrible and a liar so I really don’t believe you now”.

I lose my mind. What kind of mother gets a phone call like the one from NX and doesn’t speak to her daughter the next time she sees her? Calls her to ask or scold? Instead, calls the other man to talk about me behind my back and how I’ve “made her suffer her whole life”? And tells him to give me a message about NX like I’m the one stalking him?! I send her a text telling her off, and she sends RS insane texts about being suicidal. This shocks RS, and actually led us to reconcile because I finally explained why NX has been randomly besties with my mom lately… so that if I ever speak up about him, she won’t believe me because he charms and flirts with her. 

So now, I’m mad at NM. RS feels terrible about how she treats me and admitted he knew nothing happened and wants to support me recovering from this. And NX has told my NM that I’m lying about him forcing himself in the house/bed - and essentially thinks I’m falsely accusing him and hates me/blocked me after a bunch of insults, saying he’s sorry for my mom and he sees who I really am, even though he’s been the abuser. I can’t apologize or explain because I’m blocked. 

I’m not speaking to my mom but the fact that I created a lie about something so terrible is killing me. I called my therapist and we are unpacking why it is I feel like I have to endure mistreatment from others out of the fear of my mom finding out. She mistreats me and turns my entire family against me, and I now realize that any reputation I have is because she openly and freely talks badly about me behind my back. She still to this day hasn’t said a word to me about this situation, but told RS she wanted to hang herself. 

I know what I did was wrong and I wish I could apologize to NX, even though his mistreatment is legitimate too. I try to say who cares, he abuses you… but it doesn’t always make me feel better about lying. He will be back at my door soon unfortunately. 

Am I a terrible person or is my bad behaviour a result of a severely toxic and abusive NM? I feel really bad about myself and I promised myself I’ll do whatever it takes to change and be a different, better person.

I have no clue how there's anything left in me 😭 I've taken imodium and pepto, and it slows the tide for a while, but I'm on day 2 and wondering if there's anything else to try? I'm missing too much work over this. I am still waiting for my first gastro appointment, so do I go to urgent care? Stick to the brat diet? Keep taking more imodium?

I usually only get paradoxical diarrhea, and it lasts a few hours, but we're going on 2 days straight now. I'd really like to get some solid sleep again, among other things.",3,1744987001.0,ibs,4,1.0,False

1k26fxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1k26fxq/advice_on_finding_partner_32m_going_through_phone/,Advice on finding partner (32M) going through phone and acting weird (35F),"I don't want to post this in relationship_advice since I know he's on Reddit a lot. Not sure if he knows my username so we'll see. 

I woke up to my partner going through my phone without permission. He'd been acting weird towards me the day before, just off, less physical connection and less affectionate than his usual self. He brightened up after dinner but then the next morning I woke up before he was leaving for work and caught him with my phone. He claimed he was using it to find his phone and ""damn android doesn't know how to use it"" like the call button isn't at the bottom of the screen... I'm not stupid, I've lived this experience before from my last relationship with the most toxic shitty man. I saw he had an open text message between a friend and I up and scrolled way higher. I don't know if he thinks he got away with it or not tbh. But he was distant again and wouldn't cuddle with me while he was finishing his coffee as we normally do and wouldn't kiss me goodbye. 

I'm assuming he didn't get the whole context of the conversation and is spiraling down this rabbit hole of me cheating or hiding something. The chat was with a male friend, Harold, who I've known for the last ten years, I'm not attracted to him at all & our relationship is platonic. The conversation he I guess had read the end of was about an ongoing joke about my friend and I starting a twitch channel for money, I'm the cute face and he actually plays the games ECT. I lost my job a few months ago and while talking about how I was feeling about that I made a comment about how we should have totally started that twitch account or maybe I should sell feet pictures or look for a sugar daddy. Harold was saying he has a friend who does it and how hard it is to actually run and make money off doing that. I said well that's what AI is for now right? Like ""respond sexily"" to this message. 

I've told my partner about this twitch idea shit before with Harold. This isn't new information to him, in fact we were even talking about selling feet pictures that night together! I've also brought up maybe being a sugar baby to my partner before when I've been exasperated about the job hunt. It's not a serious topic.

My partner is now being very cryptic and sending me messages like : I do deserve someone transparent, committed, and honest. Like, no secrets, right? That would just fuck everything up and waste the best thing to happen to us, huh?

Obviously I got defensive and hurt, it feels like he's accusing me of something and is testing me to say something about it. But there's nothing for me to come forward with... I'm literally not doing anything.

Me: Cooooool okay guess this is why you've been weird to me and I do not know what's going on. I'm not hiding anything from you I literally don't know what you think is going on, I have told you so many times I wouldn't cheat on you I'm not that kind of person. I don't have any secrets from you and I don't know how many different ways I can tell you that""

Him :""I haven't accused you of anything.Weird you got defensive about it, though. Err, not weird, actually. Pretty normal, unfortunately.""

Me: ""Because I've had ex's accuse me of things that aren't true and it's very triggering. You're making me feel very uncomfortable with the phrasing and how you've been treating me this morning and yesterday and you brought up cheating on Saturday so of course I'm assuming that's what this is all about""

Him :""And I've had exes that got defensive and doubled down while I waited to see how far they go before I told them I already know""

It feels like he's waiting to have this AHA moment with me and accuse me of something. But y'all I'm too old for this behavior, I'm not a cheater, I don't have the energy to seek attention from men elsewhere or to fuck around. Being in a relationship is an addition to my life not something I need I'm fine being single, I'm not codependent at all. I am struggling with depression and job loss and feelings of being an absolute failure. My dog has been showing signs of her age and I'm incredibly worried I'll have to put her down soon. I'm very close to hitting rock bottom, if I dont find a job soon I'll have to sell my house and I don't really know what happens from then on. I have expressed to him that I'm not in a good head space, I've had suicidal thoughts and to have my partner treating me like this has put me into more anxiety and I feel a million times worse. He won't respond to me and hasn't tried to reach out. I'm incredibly hurt, angry and upset, he went through my phone without my consent and this feeling that he doesn't trust for no reason other than his own paranoia sucks. If he'd approached me and tried talking to me I'd have let him go through my phone without question.

I guess I'm reaching out into the reddit void to ask how to handle this and how to calm myself down and whenever he talks to me how to have this conversation with him. It's clear his anxiety and anxious attachment style and past traumas are spiraling in his brain too. ",5,1744986935.0,AskWomenOver30,16,0.78,False

It’s all downhill from here.” But it never got any easier. The +16,000 ft [4,876 m] passes kept coming.

First the “Hill of Black Death” along Bolivia’s prismatic “Lagunas” route. Then a week of 75-mile days across the Atacama Desert in northern Chile and Argentina. Two days of pavement felt like a luxury. I found kiwi fruits in a small village called Susques and thought I was hallucinating. Then I reconnected with gravel backroads toward San Antonio de los Cobres and Abra del Acay, the highest point on the famed Ruta 40.

“Ripios,” a rough translation for washboards and rubble, became a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn’t avoid, asking how long it lasted and where the worst parts were. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More cold nights in the tent and savoring each drop of camp coffee before the road sat up to meet me like a clay-colored fist.

I looked vampiric at the summit of Abra del Acay [16,060 ft or 4,895 m], covered in chalky dust and struggling to catch my breath. I crouched behind a small altar to add more winter layers against the cyclonic battering of wind. A tawny orange fox was there too, pawing at the rocks in search of food.

Daylight cratered fast in the valley below, as did its frigid temps. I raced south toward lower elevations to camp for the night. More inescapable desert and rusted canyons.

* I only drink medium to dark roast coffee.
* I typically drink a pour-over coffee in the morning (made with an AeroPress) and an espresso after lunch.
* I'm the only one making coffee in the house.
* I currently use a K6 hand grinder.
* I'm planning to get a Cafelat Robot when they are back in stock.

The process of hand grinding is generally fine with me but there are days where I just want/need things to be a little simpler.

Decision criteria:

* The grinder should be quiet.
* Need to switch between different grind settings on a daily basis.
* I think I'll be drinking a single bean so single-dose is not necessary, it might even be a disadvantage because weighing is required for every coffee.

I'm thinking of getting either a DF54 or a Eureka Mignon Specialita (very quiet), although from what I understand the Specialita would potentially need a mod to be able to switch between grind settings consistently. I obviously prefer to spend less but at the same time I imagine this to be a purchase for years so I'd rather get the \*right\* machine for me.

## What is Norvexiopro?

Norvexiopro is an **automated trading platform** that helps users buy and sell assets like crypto, stocks, and forex using smart algorithms and real-time data. It’s designed to simplify trading, especially for beginners who are still figuring out how to read candlestick charts or know what RSI even means.

The platform uses what appears to be **AI-driven algorithms** to scan the markets and make smart decisions based on trends, news, and price movements. While it doesn’t promise guaranteed profits (and no legit platform should), it does aim to give users an edge—**especially those who don’t have time to trade manually**.

## Who Created Norvexiopro?

There's not a ton of public information about the exact individuals or company founders behind Norvexiopro—pretty standard for platforms in this niche. However, it appears that Norvexiopro was developed by a team of traders and software engineers who’ve worked with similar products like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**.

What matters more is that Norvexiopro **partners with licensed and regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of transparency and legitimacy. While the anonymous founding team might raise an eyebrow for some users, it’s not uncommon in the fintech world where privacy and decentralization are part of the culture.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Norvexiopro Today](https://tinyurl.com/49asvf3h)
## How Does Norvexiopro Work?

At its core, Norvexiopro works by using **smart algorithms** to make trading decisions on your behalf. Once you create an account and fund it, the platform can start analyzing the market in real-time and executing trades based on parameters you set—or let the system decide if you're going full-auto.

Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:
- You sign up and verify your account.
- Fund your account with a **minimum of $250.**
- Choose trading settings (manual or automatic).
- The bot starts placing trades based on market trends.
- You monitor performance and adjust preferences as needed.

It’s kind of like having a personal trading assistant that doesn’t need sleep or coffee.

## Norvexiopro Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- **User-friendly for beginners** with no prior trading experience.
- Supports **multiple asset types** (not just crypto).
- **Fast account setup** and easy verification process.

**Cons:**

High school language teacher here.  Yesterday was brutal with the kids champing at the bit for spring break, a fire drill, a broken copier/printer, a 504 meeting (which I naturally forgot about until the moment the sub walked into my room and I had to scramble to adapt my lesson), racing to my sons elementary school during my prep to watch a presentation he was giving that parents had been invited to, doing a cooking lesson with one of my classes because I thought it would be a chill, last day before break kind of lesson but just ended up being more work for me on an already hectic day…

FINALLY on spring break starting today.  Slept late this morning.  Sat on the couch all morning with coffee.  It’s a beautiful chilly spring morning without a cloud in the sky.  Going to my first Phillies game tonight and going to tailgate all afternoon.  What a glorious start to ten days off of school.

Allow me to add some context before I begin. I work in a small dental office of 9 staff. Our office consists of 1 Doc, 2 assistants, 3 hygiene, 2 front office, 1 office manager. 
Our office does very well. 

The only thing our Dr / Office manager ever does for us is on our birthday we get a free lunch (which is often forgot about) and a $25 visa gift card (this year I received it in cash) 

Once a year he might pay for a full office lunch, however it is usually only because we have a training that takes place during our lunch hour. 

He offers medical/vision insurance which he pays 75% of the premium (I still pay $260 a month for only myself) and 0% for spouse/children. 401k is a 3% match. He is a very lax doctor to work for (prob a lil too lax at times)

Anyways, I see other offices where the OM or Dr buys everyone breakfast or lunch often, or just coffee on occasion. Other offices will have team building activities with outings once a month, like a dinner and axe throwing for example. I’ve seen posts where of OM will bring in a cake for whoever’s birthday it is and sing HBD.. Very rare, but Dr. will take the staff on a trip every year to somewhere nice (I’ve seen Hawaii, Disneyland, Ski trips, etc) Things like that that could really bring up the morale in the office! 

Myself and others have brought up in the past how we felt with the lack of staff appreciation. What we’ve gotten back is Dr provides great benefits and pays a decent wage all while being an easy guy to work for. I am not arguing that at all! 

Anyways, what are your guys thoughts on this? How does your office do things?

I know I should just be grateful for a job and healthcare (which I am extremely grateful) but a little more effort goes a long way to retain a great staff.  

Thanks!

1k2602q,https://i.redd.it/yidbgbuiqlve1.jpeg,The Uncomfortable House: Where Productivity Is Home,"**“Comfort is the first vice of those who’ve stopped being useful.” — Some manager suffering from a productivity attack.**

Welcome to our latest living concept: the Uncomfortable House™. Perfect for shaping the new man, the one who’s always on edge, performing, forever sporting the LinkedIn posture with a [Monday.com](http://Monday.com) mindset. A project designed not for well-being, but for efficiency. After all, we all know that comfort is the first step towards decay.

**Entrance Hall: “Humility at First Glance”**

The moment you step through the door (made of brushed steel, handle-less, you have to push it with the weight of your own insecurity), you’re greeted by a long, narrow, and deliberately crooked hallway. The LED lights are cold, 6000k, flickering intermittently, just to maintain a constant sense of “not belonging.” The walls are adorned with motivational quotes in Comic Sans, creating that perfect blend of anxiety and disgust to get you started on the right foot.

**Living Room: “The Relax Zone That Doesn’t Relax”**

Welcome to the living room, the nerve center of residential discomfort. The sofa is a block of concrete, hand-carved by a former Finnish special forces soldier. The seats? Angled at 78°, so you can never truly lie down, but you can’t sit for too long either without triggering some childhood trauma. In the center, a glass coffee table… tilted. It’s designed to spill your coffee onto your lap and remind you to stay alert and work on your soft skills.

That damn TV? Gone. Instead, a wall showing your monthly performance screen: steps taken, calories burned, emotional KPIs. You haven’t watched a movie in months, but you’ve learned to love pie charts. And love them well.

**Kitchen: “Hunger as Creative Stimulus”**

Here, every detail is designed to make you a better person. No longer comfortable, no longer serene — simply more productive. The oven is there, of course, but it doesn’t cook. It’s been repurposed as a motivational debriefing center. Every time you open it, a brief vocal self-analysis session pops up, asking you, “Do you really need gratin potatoes at 7:00 PM, or are you just running away from yourself?”

No more emotional eating: just raw introspection.

The burners only work after you’ve reached a minimum number of steps for the day, tracked by an integrated app. The kitchen is no longer a place of pleasure, but of conquest.

The pots are designed to never distribute heat evenly. A physical metaphor for life, where nothing cooks just right unless you’re there, constantly checking.

The fridge? Only accessible after passing a quick quiz on contemporary corporate culture, to remind you that even eating is a performance, a privilege to be earned.

In this kitchen, you don’t gain weight. Not because you eat less, but because every action is so complex, every obstacle so deliberate, that in the end, you give up. And in that resignation, voilà, the victory of the system: a light body, a sharp mind, ready to answer your boss’s emails at 10:47 PM. Because eating is no longer a need — it’s a distraction. And distractions don’t bring results.

**Bedroom: “The Temple of Wakefulness”**

Welcome to the bedroom, where rest is a theory, not a practice. The bed, designed for those who don’t have time to waste lying down, is suspended twenty centimeters off the ground by adjustable tension cables. It’s unstable enough to keep your body in a constant state of postural alertness.

The covering is raw linen, chosen not for its breathability, but for its slightly irritating properties, strategically placed on the most sensitive areas of your skin. Because true relaxation, as we know, comes from conscious discomfort.

The mattress, developed in collaboration with a biological research center, is designed to follow the natural curves of a reptile’s spine. Its sinuous profile forces constant micro-muscular adjustments during the night, training your psychophysical resilience, even in unconsciousness.

The pillow? An elegant cotton shell, filled with hand-selected river stones, chosen for their irregular shape. The goal is not comfort, but the activation of productive dreams: no more restorative sleep, but mental scenarios where you train to solve business problems, even in the folds of your subconscious.

And to complete the picture, an integrated wake-up system embedded directly in the mattress vibrates gently every 45 minutes. Not enough to wake you fully, but just enough to remind you that inertia is a luxury. And that time, even at night, is a resource to capitalize on.

**Bathroom: “Privacy is Weakness”**

At the heart of the bathroom stands the toilet, placed exactly in the center of the room. No walls, no doors. Because isolation is a vice, and intimacy a hindrance to productivity. Even if you live alone, this arrangement reminds you that you’re always being observed, evaluated, judged. After all, control is a form of love. The mirror? A masterpiece of technology and disdain. It doesn’t just reflect you — it analyzes you. Equipped with AI, it scans your face with the precision of a manic dermatologist. Every morning, red circles highlight enlarged pores, discolorations, dark circles, wrinkles, and even unspoken negative thoughts. It doesn’t turn the light on unless you’ve smiled at least three times in 10 minutes.

Its purpose? To get you used to scrutiny, pressure, constant judgment. Because only those who know they’re always under examination can aspire to perfection.

Or at least fake it well enough.

**Study: “Where Anxiety Takes Notes”**

Welcome to the beating heart of domestic productivity, the place where the individual becomes a resource. Every piece of furniture is designed to stimulate focus and discourage any deviation toward contemplation, slowness, or, God forbid, boredom.

The desk is a masterwork of ergonomic dissuasion: slightly tilted downwards, preventing anything from staying in balance. Pens roll, papers slip, laptops require a steady and continuous hand. It’s designed to keep you vigilant. You can’t lean back. You can’t relax. You must be present, always.

The chair is a managerial reinterpretation of a milking stool: no backrest, rigid seating, slightly unstable. This is how the body learns to stay tense, alert, ready to react. Who said working seated should be comfortable? Comfort is the first step toward apathy.

In front of you, a backlit screen with ultra-high contrast keeps your pupils in constant exercise. Every so often, a pop-up window with motivational phrases in caps lock appears:

“IF YOU CAN READ THIS, YOU CAN DO MORE”  
“TIME IS A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT”

Notifications can’t be turned off, but they’re there to remind you of your worth. Based on what you produce.

On the walls, abstract graphs shaped like performance curves: they’re there to decorate, sure, but also to subtly guilt-trip you when you’re not performing at your best. No family photos, no personal objects: privacy is a distraction.

The light is white, cold, surgical. Always on, always direct. Set to reduce melatonin production: sleep is a luxury granted only to those who’ve closed the day with at least one upward curve on their graph.

Welcome to the study that turns your home into a performance accelerator. Because, in the end, we don’t work to live. We live to not disappoint expectations.

**And here we are at the end of the tour…**

The Uncomfortable House doesn’t embrace you. It doesn’t welcome you. It doesn’t cuddle you. It makes you perform. It makes you efficient. It makes you productive. It’s the house that the perfect state dreams of for every free citizen.

But then one must ask:

What if inadequacy is the real design?

What if that hard sofa was made to get us up, not to keep us down?

What if a cozy bed today is a radical gesture?

What if cooking in peace was the last act of freedom left?

Perhaps design isn’t always there to make us efficient.

Perhaps, when it’s honest, design disobeys us.

It defends us from the cult of productivity.

It grants us the right to waste time, to serve no purpose, to simply breathe.

Because the more a house is designed to make us run, the less it lets us stay.

And the more it forces us to stand up, the clearer it becomes that it’s not home.

It’s a factory.

And we, its workers disguised as tenants.",1,1744985783.0,Sottodesign,0,1.0,False

(i’m not engaged yet but will be soon). A dream of mine has always been to have an extremely experienced team of wedding videographers hired for my special day, where they’re shooting content basically from 9am-2pm of me getting ready with my mom, sister, best friends etc, first looks, my fiancé getting ready with the guys and then hanging out, me and my fiance in the morning enjoying coffee alone exchanging our vows privately (doing it a little untraditionally), etc, all that jazz, to the very last video being my fiancé getting in the car that will drive him to the ceremony venue (this part will obviously be staged because i want content shooting to end around 2pm and he won’t head to venue until around 5pm and it’s a 5min drive). THEN, i want all of this footage edited together in a 3 min edit with a specific song i have in mind, which will then be shown at my ceremony at 5pm to all my guests, the video ending in my fiancé getting in his car and it driving away. and then the audience will see, live, not on the video as it has now ended, my fiancé driving into the venue, the end of the song playing as he arrives and walks down the aisle with his parents (again, a little more untraditional but that’s what i want). So yes, I know many of you will think this is pointless hopeless romantic stuff that could never be achieved, but I’m obviously willing to spend the time to look for a dedicated and skilled videographer team and pay well, so i want honest advice - is it POSSIBLE without totally stressing me out the day of? I was planning on having like a couple different videographers taping things 9am-2pm, then one editor getting the footage live as they tape it and editing it all throughout the morning and up until the ceremony, ideally finishing the video up by 3:30ish so we could get it all set up and get it prepped on projector.
