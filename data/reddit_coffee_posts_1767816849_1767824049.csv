1q6tdyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q6tdyo/farewell_a/,"Farewell, A","Sometimes this all feels like a hallucination. As the distance grows, and your memory fades, I find myself interrogating my own recollections more than anything.

Did I misread signs? Definitely not. But the question still circles. If anything you said was true, and for my own sanity I must believe that it was, then what I feel is not anger but a raw, persistent annoyance.

Annoyed you ever kept me like a secret to the person you call home. Because I’d rather have you as a friend than whatever covert fiction we became. Then lost. 

Why turn cocktails and coffees clandestine? When you chose to make me a secret, you never allowed us to be innocent. All completely unbeknownst to me. I think that’s when you crossed a line. Not with me, but in your home.

I chose to give you the benefit of the doubt for weeks then months. Until that night under two full moons and shimmering constellations when I finally dared ask the question I felt a responsibility to raise.

Like I said, sometimes it all feels like a hallucination. Or perhaps an illusion; physically real but built on trickery. 

So as I found myself gaslighting my own memories and rewriting myself as a villainous temptress, I pulled your letters off the shelf and your jacket out of my closet. I reread your own words, in your handwriting, marked with your scent and remember it was real. I never misread the signs. I was never a villain.

But then I remember who wrote those words. I remember the magnetic, beguiling man who pulled me in deeper time after time and I remember just how unreliable that narrator can be. Then the cycle repeats itself, shearing away scraps of my sanity with it. 

So here I am. In your jacket, cloaked in your cologne, surrounded by eight letters and EF5 whirling in my mind causing destruction and devastation with every new what-if. 

That’s why I have to quit you. Because the higher the winds, the deeper the wounds and I can’t sustain anymore damage or brave another storm like this. I sure as hell cannot write you again, confessing and dissecting the carnage. After all, I’m not your problem and you have plenty of those on your own. 

Here’s my farewell to you, A. You’ll never see it but I had to write it. This letter will never be sealed, never be delivered. It will be destroyed, just like my others. 

Just like us. ",1,1767823923.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

The quiet Arizona flex nobody is yelling about (which is the point)

If you’re hunting for a place that feels intentional instead of slapped together by a developer with a spreadsheet and a dream, let’s talk about Verrado and its not-so-secret centerpiece, Victory Steps.

This is West Valley Arizona done right. Not flashy. Not desperate. Just solid, grounded, and quietly impressive.

Victory Steps is not a “cute little walk”

Calling Victory Steps a “trail” undersells it. It’s a stair climb carved into the hillside that makes you question your life choices around step 37. By step 120-ish, your lungs are filing a formal complaint.

And that’s the magic.

Locals use it for:

Morning sanity resets

Evening sweat sessions

Weekend family hikes where kids somehow have infinite energy and adults pretend they’re fine


At the top, you get wide-open desert views, Verrado laid out below, and sunsets that make you stop scrolling and just stare like a functioning human again.

This is the kind of place where fitness sneaks up on you because it’s attached to something beautiful.

Verrado feels… human

Verrado isn’t trying to be Scottsdale. Thank goodness.

It’s walkable. Tree-lined. Built with front porches that imply neighbors might actually talk to each other. There’s a real town center vibe with Verrado Main Street, local coffee, restaurants, and community events that don’t feel like corporate team-building exercises.

You’ll see:

Parents pushing strollers at sunset

Runners weaving through the streets

Kids on bikes who still think outside exists


It feels like a place designed for people who live there, not just people passing through.

Nature is not a background prop here

One of Verrado’s biggest flexes is proximity to the White Tank Mountains.

This means:

Miles of hiking and mountain biking

Desert landscapes that still feel wild

Trails where you hear birds instead of traffic


You can go from neighborhood sidewalks to rugged desert terrain in minutes. No long drives. No planning committee. Just shoes on, go.

It’s family-friendly without being boring

Verrado somehow threads the needle between “great for families” and “not soul-crushing.”

There are parks everywhere. Playgrounds. Community pools. Trails that work for both kids and adults who need to move before they say something regrettable.

Schools, sports, outdoor events, seasonal festivals. The kind of place where routines form naturally because the environment supports them.

The underrated part no one markets

Verrado attracts people who want space, structure, and calm. That shapes the vibe.

It’s not loud. It’s not chaotic. It’s not trying to impress strangers on Instagram.

It’s built for people who value:

Consistency over hype

Health over convenience

Community over constant novelty


Victory Steps fits perfectly into that mindset. You don’t conquer it once and move on. You come back. Over and over. Because it gives you something back every time.

Final take

Verrado isn’t a destination you brag about online.
It’s a place you quietly build a life.

Victory Steps isn’t a tourist attraction.
It’s a ritual.

And the surrounding desert isn’t scenery.
It’s part of the system that keeps people grounded, active, and present.

If you know, you know.
If you don’t… that’s kind of the point.",1,1767823726.0,HealthandTravels,0,1.0,False

Customers asked for her by name, she knew everyones orders, super bubbly personality. I thought she was irreplaceable honestly.

But I started noticing our numbers were off. Not hugely but enough that I was losing sleep over it. Inventory didnt match sales, we were going through way more supplies than we should for our ticket averages. I initially blamed it on waste or bad tracking on my end.

Long story short, caught her on camera giving free drinks to friends and taking cash sales without ringing them up. When I confronted her she got defensive and said ""everyone does this at coffee shops"" and that I should be grateful she brought in so many regulars. I had to let her go.

Here's the crazy part. I was terrified wed lose customers. But ever since she left our sales have actually been up. Not just a little better but like consistently better numbers. I think she was pocketing way more than I even realized and her ""regulars"" were probably just people getting free stuff.

My other employees seemed relieved too which was unexpected. Apparently shed been creating drama and making their shifts miserable but I was so focused on the customer facing stuff I didnt see it.

Lesson learned I guess, sometimes the person who seems the most valuable is actually costing you the most. Both in actual money (glad I had some saved up for situations like this) and in team morale.",12,1767823462.0,smallbusiness,3,0.93,False

Wondering if anyone can relate to my current situation:

\--I feel backed up most of the time, mostly in my rectum. This is even with pooping multiple times a day. This has been going on for a couple of years.

\--When i wake up, i eat and drink coffee and take miralax. This produces movements, thank god, but poop is always mush and I keep having movements (maybe three?) until finished. Over the course of a couple of hours. I feel that--they are not quite 'needed', in the sense that maybe my meds (miralax, etc) are making poop move through me more quickly than necessary? But otherwise, I feel backed up and uncomfortable. 

  
\--After I'm done pooping, my gut often feels sore and I feel exhausted. Like, it doesn't feel like a 'natural' way of doing things. I never, ever needed to 'go' more than once a day. And then was finished. But then, constipation hit and now if i don't make a LOT happen, it's knocking at my 'back door' all day/night and very uncomfortable. 

  
\--Sometimes i wonder if poop is passing too quickly through me? 

  
\--I also don't really feel my digestion 'happening'....I feel a sense of 'quiet' in my gut/intestines after eating, but the poop always ends up at my rectum rather quickly. 

  
Is this an IBS-C kinda thing? Combo of constipation and guts not being quite right? 

I wonder if a motility drug would allow things to progress more naturally. 

I'm post-menopausal and sure that dearth of hormones have played a role. 

  
(I have had colonoscopy, and a rectocele-check (don't have it)...)

1q6t4du,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q6t4du/the_flayed_deer_of_mossy_pines/,The Flayed Deer of Mossy Pines,"When I was a little boy, I was fascinated with the unknown ever since my father told me stories about my great-grandfather, who always swore up and down that he saw Bigfoot. The way he told it, the story sounded genuine, tangible, like it could've happened. It wasn't the ordinary tale of 'I heard this sound' followed by a strange noise that could easily be explained as a bobcat or a horrific mountain lion scream that sounds like a banshee. My great-grandfather saw something large, hairy, and intelligent. According to the tale, he saw him fashioning a tool, like some caveman. When my father told me the story, I believed it. You can always tell when someone is bullshitting you just from the look on their face. A curve of a smile, or maybe a fidgetiness of excitement, but for me, it's always the eyes. When someone tells you a made-up story, they'll look around you instead of at you. And my father, he was staring right into my soul.

I grew up, went to college, got a steady job at first, and then I was able to become a cryptozoologist like I'd always wanted. I take calls from folks to investigate, and I get sent pictures and videos to confirm their authenticity. The latter has been getting especially frustrating as of late, with the continuing AI Slop that propagates throughout the internet. At least old hoax videos and pictures had some effort put into them, some genuine craft. Now though? You just generate all sorts of bull shit. Investigations slowed down a lot since COVID, and many folks have just become outright antagonistic nowadays. I show up with a camera and audio equipment as well as other odds and ends, and folks just stare at me funny. One example is that this fella in Tennessee said he spotted the wendigo out in the middle of the forest. I listened to his testimony over the phone, and he seemed genuine in his belief. So I drove on down to ask if I could investigate around his house since he lived deep in the woods. So, I drove down there, and as I was unloading my equipment, he came out yelling,

""What's all that?!""

I assured him that the equipment was necessary to capture what he experienced,

""I don't like it! You gonna film me? Make me look like some fool?!""

I also assured him that if I decided to release any of my findings, he'd remain anonymous. He eased off and let me finish. He sat on the porch scowling at me and smoking a cigarette. I set up everything, and I monitored everything from my laptop from inside his house for a long, long time. I'm talking nearly twelve hours. Even when I slept, as soon as I woke up, I'd scan over the footage that I had missed while I was asleep. And when I didn't find anything, he shouted at me for wasting his damn time.

After an experience like that, I'm glad I didn't do investigations often. I've sort of become a stay-at-home cryptozoologist now, often being a debunker or listening to folks' firsthand accounts. Some folks call me a skeptic, but I'd argue that I'm a healthy skeptic. While I want to believe in the things I'm looking at, I'm not going to fall head over heels for every case I come across. Lord, I've done so many cases now that I lost count. I've even bought some mics along with some soundproof foam in hopes of starting a podcast over the experiences that I've had. While I can't necessarily vouch for the authenticity of every cryptid that I've come across, I've definitely seen my fair share of strangeness.

However, what I experienced recently has left me shaken to say the least. I received a phone call back in November from, well, let's just keep it anonymous, but if you really want to look for where it is, you might find what you're looking for in Appalachia. The call came from a woman who asked if I'd like to come investigate something that she said was the explanation. It was a Sunday afternoon, and I was tired, so I replied with a snarky comment that I admit wasn't the kindest,

""Listen, I'm a cryptozoologist, not a paranormal investigator. If yoy wanna get Zach Baggins, be my guest.""

As I said, I sounded like a grumpy asshole. But she was kind enough to respond and give me more grace than I deserved,

""It does have to do with your field of work."" She said, ""I'm speaking of a *thing*, not an experience.""

""So, you've seen something then?""

""I have. And..."" She quit talking, and I heard her sniffling; her breath was shaky, ""...Oh God...""

I sobered up almost immediately and spoke much more kindly,

""H-Hey, now, I'm... I'm so sorry, Miss?""

""Janice. My name is Janice.""

""Listen, if you're not comfortable talking about it over the phone, I could meet up with you and talk if you want.""

""That'd be lovely.""

I set a date when I could drive down, and she gave me directions on how to get to her. Mossy Pines is a small town, and that's stretching the word extremely fucking thin. It is a tiny little town. Don't bother looking for it, but I don't think you'd find it anyway. I punched in the exact coordinates into my phone, and the location didn't even appear on Google Maps; if anything, it looked like I was going off-road. That is, until I saw the old 'Welcome to Mossy Pines' sign, below it was a slogan, 'A Great Place to Raise A Family!' I arrived early in the morning, fog still rested on the ground and amongst the surrounding mountains. It was serene, albeit a little eerie.

I drove around the old buildings, seeing a scant amount of folks out and about. There was a shabby downtown that had most of the businesses shut down, and the one business that was open was a general store with a neon 'OPEN' sign blinking on and off. I saw a diner named 'Pappy's Greasy Spoon' and knew that must've been the place where I'm supposed to meet with Janice. She mentioned a restaurant in town, and it was the only one I could spot. I looked at my dashboard and saw I had plenty of time to kill. So, I drove around he town, getting a feel for Mossy Pines, and the more I looked around, the more uneasy I felt. I saw a handful of houses that looked functional but were in bad shape. Folks were on their porches just staring at me as I drove down the road with curiosity in their gaze. The rest of the houses were worse, with most of them being completely overtaken by nature. Smashed out windows, collapsed chimneys, unkempt tall grass swallowed the yards, and moss and kudzu devoured the remains of the houses.

After I had my fill of looking at the remains of what looked to be a moderately sized small town, I decided to head back to the diner. The parking lot only had about three or four cars out front. The exterior looked like a 50s diner crossed with a long cabin, but it looked withered by time. The windows were unclean, the wooden steps were splintering, and the sign out front was rusting away. I ascended the steps and walked in; the door chimed with little dangling bells. The interior smelled heavenly with the aroma of fried oils, coffee, and cooked meat. I looked around the place, observing the folks who were in attendance. There was a lone, scruffy-looking cook behind the grill. There was an old couple in the back chatting to themselves, and another older man who sat alone with a newspaper and a cup of coffee. I eventually found a woman, younger than the rest but still older than me, waving to me. She was kind-looking, she had shoulder-length, greying hair with eyes that I can only describe as tired.

I sat down at the booth with her, and I asked,

""What's good in this place? I'm starved.""

She smiled and said,

""I always thought Dale's Biscuits and Gravy were especially good.""

""Then I'll have that!""

The old cook, who I'm assuming was Dale, wandered over with a mug and a pitcher of coffee. He filled it up and asked what I wanted to eat, and I told him. He ambled back to the kitchen and got started on my breakfast. I cleared my throat and sat up straight. Whenever I conduct myself for my clients, I always try to give them the respect they deserve; it's not just for good business, but I consider it a genuine courtesy to treat someone's experiences as if they were facts. I placed my satchel beside me and retrieved the TASCAM recorder and hooked up a small cardioid microphone.

""Now, then,"" I said, ""Over the phone, you talked about something you couldn't explain. Care to try and tell me exactly what that was?""

Her smile disappeared, she sipped her coffee, and looked out the window. The town was bathed in the dull greys of an overcast sky,

""I'm not crazy, just know that before I get started, okay?""

""I'm not one to call folks, ma'am.""

She looked back at me, her eyes wet, not with tears, but maybe they were going to become tears.

""Mossy Pine is cursed.""

""This town?""

""Yes.""

""How so?""

""We've got something here, it's in the woods, it...it hates us.""

""So this thing, is it like a harbinger for bad times? In Point Pleasant, the Moth Man was a sort of-""

""No. It feeds off misery. It...""

The tears finally came, I reached out for a hand, and she took it; it was trembling.

""Take your time.""

""I know...I know...I've just...everyone in town acts like it's normal, but it's not! They act like that thing out there is just a natural part of life. They've made peace with it, and I say fuck that!""

This small outburst gained looks from some of the patrons for a brief moment, but they quickly dismissed it. Janice wiped the tears from her eyes with a napkin and cleared her throat. She took a deep breath and sighed,

""Have you ever, in your field of work, heard of the Flayed Deer?""

In my years as an expert on the unnatural animals and myths in the United States, I don't think I've ever heard something with a name quite like that. I've come across many different and unique cryptids that I've studied. The Giant Ambling Skeleton, Fresno Nightcrawlers, The Pope Lick Monster, Thunderbird, the Ozark Howler, Frogman, and many other illustrious names. Never heard of The Flayed Deer before. I was legitimately stumped. 

""I'm sorry, but I've never heard of it.""

This seemed to upset her greatly; she was visibly shaken that I had no idea what this thing was. I asked her,

""Why does it have that name, and what does it look like?""

""It's got that name *because* of its look.""

""And?""

She sipped her coffee again, and with a shaky voice, she explained,

""It's a walking deer skeleton, and it's draped in flayed human skin.""

This was certainly something new and unsettling to me. I looked at my forearm and saw that my hair was on end and my skin was breaking out in goosebumps. She continued,

""It's been here, lingering in the town since its founding, like a fog.""

""Do you have any background on it? Any information would be helpful.""

""Most folks don't have an explanation for it; everyone you see here in town has just given up, accepted it like it's a local pest. I feel like I'm the only one left who has enough sense to give a shit anymore! But I'm sorry to say that I don't know much. I only know as much as my parents did. My Daddy said that it was a sort of vengeful native american spirit, but I called an expert on Native American folklore out three counties away from here, and he said he'd never heard of it either, like you. My Mama told me that she thought it was the devil himself, but she wasn't always mentally sound, God bless her.""

""Well, what do you think?""

""I used to think it was death itself, like how some folks just see strange things before they die, but I don't think so anymore.""

""How so?""

""I just think it's meaness, pure evil.""

""How is it evil?""

""It doesn't kill you right away, it just lingers around, waits until everyone you love dies, and then it'll just start tormenting you. It may not have lips or vocal cords, but it speaks to you. Whenever you get old, like me, that's when the voices start.""

When I heard the mention of voices, I felt sadness wash over me. Had I traveled all of this way and started listening to a woman who may be suffering from mental illness? She mentioned her mother was mentally unwell, so it tracks. In her eyes, she was telling the truth, I could tell, but it was the truth as she saw fit. Whenever someone is suffering from psychosis or schizophrenia, they believe every word that they're spewing. I didn't let her in on my skepticism and just played along. 

""What are the voices you hear?""

""...I hear my parents, my siblings, and...most recently my husband.""

""When did he-""

""Pass? Last year, he wandered off into the woods to get some firewood for the winter, and he never came back. I think it got him, too.""

I wondered if it was exploitative to ask this question, but I asked it anyway,

""What kind of things do these voices say?""

She looked at me with tired eyes, she looked at her empty mug of coffee, and shouted to Dale,

""Could I get some more coffee, Dale?""

""Yep,"" he grunted,

He wandered over and filled the mug to the top. The steam rose into the air, she blew on it, and then sipped some of the coffee. 

""The voices say they want me to come to the woods.""

""Is that all?""

""They also say that they need my skin, because they're cold.""

By the time my biscuits and gravy arrived at my table, I didn't feel so hungry anymore. I reached into my wallet, but just put her hand up at me,

""Listen, I got it!""

""Oh, no, no, no, I got it.""

""Lord have mercy, you're my guest, let me treat you.""

Defeated, I put my wallet back into my pocket and ate my breakfast. It was tasty but overwhelmingly fattening; I think I had a week's worth of calories. After breakfast, I told Janice that I'd meet her back at her house to discuss what to do going forward. Before she left, I asked her,

""One more thing."" 

""Yes?""

""Why not move?""

""I tried. It followed me. I figured that I'd rather face it in my own home.""

I nodded, thanked her, and she was gone. I sat in the booth, going over what to do in my head. Janice was honest, and she believed in every word she said. However, I may be dealing with someone who may have mental issues. The story that she told me, this creature she claims to see, doesn't have any concrete origin, and I've never heard of it in my entire career. I was troubled. On the one hand, I was giving this woman closure, putting her at ease with something she's claimed to have seen, but on the other hand, was I exploiting this woman? I sat there mulling it over in my head until I got up and made my decision. 

I drove to Janice's house, which was deep in the woods, and the road was nothing more than gravel and dirt. The house itself was a nice, albeit plain, two-story house that had seen better days. The paint was chipped, the windows were opaque, and the lawn was wild but not to the level of some of the abandoned houses I'd come across. Janice sprang from the house and rushed to give me a hug. It was stronger than I anticipated.

""So glad you made it. Are you planning on staying?""

""If you'll have me.""

""Of course! I've got a spare bedroom upstairs, it should be plenty big for you.""

""Good. I've got some equipment I'm going to bring in, and I want to make sure you're absolutely certain about me recording, shooting, and collecting anything I see here. I only ask this just to be absolutely sure.""

""You have my full permission, now get inside, it's cold out there.""

The inside of the house was beautiful, and it seemed that every room had this feeling that a life was lived well there. Portraits of families on the wall that span decades, old furniture that was worn down from years of use, and paperback books with withered spines. The house smelled damp and dusty, but it was at least very warm compared to the chilliness of the November weather. 

My room was upstairs, like she said, but she never let me know that it used to be a child's bedroom. It was faded pink, the bed was big enough but noticeably smaller than I wanted, and there were little drawings pinned on the walls. The drawings were attributed to a girl named Sarah, whose name was in the corner of each piece of paper. One of them stood out to me, one of the drawings, as crude as it was, was unmistakably a deer skeleton. It sent a chill down my spine and made me feel uneasy, because it made Janice's story feel a little more real. I grabbed my things and hauled them upstairs. Janice stopped me once and asked,

""You sure you don't need any help?""

""I'm fine, but um...Whose room do I have?""

""Oh, that's my little Sarah's room. I lost her quite some time ago; she had cancer. Drove out nearly three hours for each doctor's visit, and it just...""

""Listen, I'm sorry, forget I even mentioned it. It was rude of me to ask.""

""No, it's fine, it's been a long time. Nearly twenty years now, but it still feels like yesterday. Sarah was a sweet girl, and I just know she would've been more than willing to share her room.""

The rest of that day, I consulted with Janice to get her idea of where I need to set up my cameras and audio equipment. From what she told me, the Flayed Deer sort of appeared to her wherever there wasn't a single location that I could hone in on. So, I set a perimeter around her house, creating a perfect circle with the cameras, and installed top-of-the-line audio equipment, also positioned in a similar circle, pointing out into the forest. I explained to Janice that the process could take nearly a week before I could come to a conclusion about the existence of a cryptid, especially something that's not been documented or recorded in history, like the Flayed Deer.

The first night yielded no results, much to my disappointment. I very rarely got any results on the first night of investigations. The following morning, I looked around the woods surrounding the house, looking for possible hoofprints or any other signs of disturbance, but came up short. The second night, I caught footage of a possum with a litter of babies on its back crossing the driveway. It was cute, but not what I was looking for. However, I did hear the rustling of leaves out in the distance caught on some of the audio, followed by a loud clacking noise. When I investigated in the morning, I saw that one of the trees around the house had the bark stripped from the trunk. A deer was here scraping its antlers across the wood; it was something, but it was easily explained. Night three was much more interesting because on the night vision camera, I saw something. It was dark, very dark, but deep within the woods, I saw two reflecting eyes looking at the camera. I could hear the leaves rustling beneath it as whatever it was walked, and then I caught something on the audio recorders. It was faint, barely even a whisper, but as I boosted the volume all the way up to one hundred. It was a withered old voice saying in a dull, flat tone,

"".....Can you see me.....I can see you....""

Then it ran off, leaves crunching beneath its feet, and I just sat there frozen in my room because the voice that I heard belonged to my grandmother, who has been dead for nearly thirty years. 

That morning, I walked to the sight of where this thing might've been standing, looking at one of my cameras. Janice shouted from the porch,

""What're you doing?""

I shouted back,

""Just checking something.""

When I approached the scene, I saw something sunken into the leaves and mud. It was deer prints, all of them pointed directly at the house. I kept this information to myself, and I went back to Pappy's for breakfast. I just had eggs, bacon, and toast this time. When she asked me if I'd seen anything yet, I was honest,

""I saw some things that could be easily explained, but I have this audio I can't explain. A voice, it sounds...familiar to me.""

Her face grew weary and distraught,

""Oh God,"" she said, ""It's latched onto you.""

I smiled, trying to play it off,

""I've been told I've been cursed plenty of times, Janice. I'll manage, but I appreciate the concern.""

""It'll follow you when you leave.""

""It'll have a lot of ground to cover, trust me.""

She just looked at me with heavy, tired eyes and quietly began eating her breakfast. We didn't talk the rest of the day.

Night four was another dud, nothing at all. I took a walk around the house in the morning, checking my things, making sure that everything was functioning in these last three days of recording. Janice called my name from behind,

""Peter!""

""Yes?!"" 

I heard nothing and yelled louder,

""Yes?!""

Nothing, 

""What do you want, Janice?!""

""I'm sorry?"" a voice said in front of me,

That's when I saw Janice was walking out of the house, looking at me, utterly confused,

""Were you saying my name?""

I turned around and saw a brief glimpse of two great antlers poking out from behind a large tree. As soon as I saw it, it skittered away extremely fast, the sound of crunching leaves trailing behind it. I felt my stomach turn over, my blood felt icy, and I didn't realize that I was trembling.

""Good Lord, are you okay, Peter?""

""I...I heard your voice calling to me, where were you just now?""

""I was in the house, why?""

I didn't want to panic her. So, despite my pale expression, I lied to her face, said that I was fine. I had a sinking feeling that she didn't believe me, but she went with it anyway.

The last night I was there, I stared at the monitors from the laptop in Sarah's room. I watched the wilderness around the house and listened to the ambience of wind rustling through the branches. I fell asleep halfway through. I attribute it to stress, but I was awoken by the sound of a voice calling from outside,

""Mama!"" said a voice so sweet it'd melt your heart.

I brushed the crust from my eyes and looked at the camera feed to see something on the edge of the forest. The moonlight showed the outline of a deer with two large antlers. Smoked bellowed from its nostrils as it snorted in the cold air. I heard the voice coo again,

""Mama, it's cold outside!"" 

I ran to the door to try to tell Janice, but found it locked. I jiggled the knob, shook the door, and even tried to shoulder it. But Janice's voice spoke to me in an eerie calm,

""It's okay, Peter, I knew this would happen. I held it off for as long as I could.""

""Janice, open the door!""

""I brought you here so you can see what happens! Our town has had to fear this thing, and no one helped us because they didn't believe us, but you! You can make them believe!""

""Janice, you're not going out there, just stay inside, and open this fucking door!""

""Just watch, Peter, people need to understand what this thing does, what it did to all of us.""

I heard her descending the stairs, and I tried kicking the door as best as I could, but to no avail. I looked on with horror at the camera feed as the great stag emerged from the treeline, its body illuminated by the moonlight. It was a great skeletal deer, and upon its head, neck, and back were pieces of flayed human skin. It lay on the deer like some sort of holy cloak of flesh and hair. The skins were of different colors, ages, and tones as well as states of decay. It trotted slowly to the front of the house, in direct view of the cameras. I heard the front door open and close. Sure enough, Janice entered the frame, unafraid and staring eye to eye with the giant stag. The antlers towered over her like the branches of an ancient tree, casting shadows over her. She spoke to it one last time,

""Go on, then. Do it.""

How do I describe what happened next? I have the footage, but I've erased the memory cards containing it. No one should see this. To my recollection, it happened like this. The stag brayed into the night, a long, high-pitched bugle. It was a deafening sound. In a trance-like state, Janice fell to her knees and stripped herself of her clothes. Then, as if by magic, her skin loosened and grew saggy. With one of its antlers, it hooked a bit of her flesh and yanked off her skin with one clean motion. Blood splattered onto the ground, and Janice was left a wet mass of structured muscle and bone. It flicked the skin backwards and lay onto the collection of human pelts it had gathered for so many years. As if she regained her senses, Janice began to scream, and it was the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. She screamed until her voice was hoarse, but the Flayed Deer just kept staring at her with the two empty sockets where eyes should've been. As she writhed in pain, she looked at the camera again and spoke with Janice's voice,

""Are you watching, Peter?""

It let out another high-pitched bugle, and Janice's suffering ceased. Her body, well, there's no easy way to say it. Her body seemingly exploded. Her flesh and bones shot in every direction, and the blood splattered the cameras, obscuring the image. Shortly after the decimation of her body, I heard the wet slaps of meat beating against the house as well as the ground outside. I stared at the laptop in shock, and through the smear of blood, I saw the Flayed Deer trot back into the dark woods. 

I didn't sleep. I eventually kept trying for the door until I broke it off its hinges. I took my things and haphazardly threw them into my car. I walked by the pulpy red stain that used to be Janice, and that's when I lost it. I drove away in tears. I was effectively having a panic attack as I drove out of Mossy Pines. I kept driving for hours until I saw that the gas was dangerously low. I fueled up at a gas station, grabbed some shitty gas station food, and kept driving on until I was home. When I came back, I think I slept for a full twelve hours.

I awoke, reviewed the footage, and instead of submitting the footage to my colleagues and friends. I removed the chips from the cameras and burned them. I figured the best way I could document this was to write about it. I wonder if this was how my grandfather felt all those years ago when he allegedly encountered something he couldn't explain? All I know is that I've gone from a healthy skeptic to a weary believer. I wish that the story ended in Mossy Pines, but I've been hearing voices at night recently. Family and friends from my past, and sometimes I'll hear Janice, too. They all say the same thing, too. They're cold, they want something to warm them up, and they always politely ask for my skin.

1q6t4dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q6t4dn/what_kind_of_water_do_you_put_in_your_espresso/,What kind of water do you put in your espresso machine?,"Apologies if I flaired this wrong. Wasn’t sure if it was buying advice or equipment discussion.

We recently bought a Breville Barista Express and I absolutely adore it. I use it 2-4x/day since I work from home. I was a barista many years ago so I’m decently familiar with how it all works but my question today is about water.

We have 3 different types of water available in our home: hard tap water, softened tap water and RO water. I’ve been using RO water to make regular coffee for years now without issue.

I recently read that RO water can be hard on espresso machines because of the lack of minerals. That seems counterintuitive to me since descaling is a part of regular maintenance on these machines. Does anyone else use RO water for espresso and have you had any issues? Is there something else I should be using?

Around a month ago me, my bf and his friend started playing COD together. We’d play for about couple hours then my bf would go to bed. I don’t sleep too well and neither does my bf’s friend (ADHD btw). I wanted to stay on and play but didn’t want to without asking my boyfriend first. I asked him if it was okay as I was worried about him feeling left out. He said no go for it and that he wouldn’t think it was weird or feel left out. Me and him have very open social circles and we both like that my friends are his friends and vice versa. He’ll regularly message my friends for a chit chat and vice versa.

Now this didn’t happen all the time but was relatively frequent. Often my bf and the friend would play alone then I might join in. My bf would go to bed after a couple hours and then we’d stay on. We also don’t live together btw. I noticed my bf being really weird with me and whenever we were on video call he’d slam drawers and act really cold towards me and I had no clue wtf was wrong and I asked him plenty times and he wouldn’t tell me. After about a week of this he tells me that he doesn’t like how much time I’m spending with his friend on COD. (We would be on for like 5 hours at a time unless I had work) and I understand for some people this is a lot. It wasn’t every night but it was frequent. I was shook right away and done anything I could to make him feel okay. I said some of the things that me and his friend spoke about and how we get on really well as we’re both quite similar and don’t have many friends. He was reassured and happy and we all went back to playing together same as before. And we both extended our support and friendship to the guy also. He doesn’t do to well mentally at times much like myself and my bf.

Despite me asking if it was okay at first  and then reassuring him he starts getting really passive aggressive and weird. Asking exactly what time I’m doing things and this just escalated. He even messaged his friend and asked why he was posting selfies on his instagram and said “who are you trying to impress”. This continued, and one night our friend then asked me if my bf was okay  because he was acting off. So friend decided to message my bf a few times and ask him to play COD with him but he ignored it.

I then made the decision to stop playing COD with friend.

But the passive aggressive stuff got worse and worse to the point where I felt like I was walking on eggshells. I then spoke to friend about it and he noticed it all more too. I was trying everything I could to reassure my bf and whenever I spoke to my friends about it they made me aware that my bf’s behaviour seemed insecure, controlling and almost projecting. I loved him so much and still do so I had no idea where it was coming from. I didn’t understand why specifically this friend was the problem and literally no other friend was.  Friend then tells me a few days later that my bf put in their group that that we had sex and he was trying to get a reaction from friend. I was disgusted and angry. I couldn’t bring it up to my bf because then he would know our friend and I spoke.

Xmas happened few days later and everything was fine and calmed down and then very suddenly a few days after Xmas an acquaintance/ friend I knew passed away under extremely tragic circumstances.

Few days later we get to new year and I realise I fucked up my travel plans to see my bf and would’ve gotten in earlier than I planned. I was also aware friend wasn’t doing great mentally and stuff so I said to him I could get him a coffee and go see him to get him out before seeing my bf. I didn’t want anyone else around me to pass away and my head was absolutely fried with everything that’s gone on. I was trying not to make my bf angry and I was trying to be a good friend so I said I’d meet him but he had to be quiet about it.

At this point my bf knew something was up and I said I never went to see friend. In hindsight this wasn’t the best decision to lie- but I was just trying to keep everyone happy and safe and I knew my bf had nothing to worry about. It was completely innocent and PG. Few nights later friend rings my phone to have a chit chat as he wasn’t  doing great, and my bf loses his mind, calls his friend and then yells at him. Our friend just clearly has no clue how to react. I then find out he knows that we met and  was upset I lied. I felt like utter shit and told him what I’ve just explained here and he ended things with me, said he couldn’t trust me. I’m now completely devastated. He is my entire life and I love him so much I can’t see my life without him. I’ve put a lot into us, I paid the deposit so he could get a flat, bought him food and bought our cats food and took them to the vets too despite not living at his place yet. I pay for us to go to festivals and things and I always support him if he’s short on cash. Im his biggest cheerleader of his musical projects and I’m always there for him. I love him to pieces. We’ve gotten past infidelity before when he was drunk and kissed a girl at a work night out, so I thought we could get past this as it’s not where near as bad. He said it was the lying itself that made him feel this way. Yet only an hour before hand he was telling me he loved me? He also told the rest of his group chat what happened so as it stand right now I think he’s told them that we were doing the nasty. (We weren’t)

I know a lot of you must think I’m dumb but please just try be respectful as I’m mentally so gone right now. I need to fix this. How can I fix this? A friendship, a band and a relationship has all ended because of me.",1,1767823239.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1q6t132,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1q6t132/need_everyones_heads_here_working_on_an_app_right/,"Need everyone's heads here, working on an app right now that might help many of you!","Hey folks,  
I'm suffering from LPR, not crazy strong, not mild either and constantly discussing with my wife what i can and can't eat, talking about recipes..asking ChatGPT..some stuff works, some stuff doesn't.   
  
With what i have nearly finished you'll be able to scan products in a supermarket, later scan any cooking recipe and the app will tell you exactly if you can eat it, shouldn't or under which conditions and maybe which ingredients to replace. 

Not based on some scientific schenanigans or what the next guy said but based on what your own body actually can eat and can't. Based on your own preferences, individual triggers and more. It even considers differences between regular GERD, LPR and more severe forms. Hopefully i'll have a first beta version for folks here by next week!

But let me explain, we all likely read tons of books, got tips what we can eat, shouldn't eat, be cautious with. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Also just by being active in here you can already see things are different with everyone. Some people here can drink tons of coffee, others get heartburn from a small sip. 

  
Over the last couple of months i created a database and some generall formulas based on product ingredients, nutrients and a few more things to get some initial tagging for which products and ingredients should hopefully be good for us and which are not. This is the base layer for the rating. 

Then, for every product or ingredient in the database you can, with a simple easy click, overwrite those rules for yourself. 

Coffee is marked as red but you can totally drink it? Or a specific brand? Tag it with ok!

The data is anonymous, you can't see who said coffee is ok but you'll be able to see how many people tagged it as ok and the more users we have the more reliable the data hopefully will be. 

Based on this we'll create data from people around the world affected by Gerd and worse, which tells us what food we can eat, and what we can't. Way more detailed than any article, doctor etc ever could and you combine that with your own personal triggers. 

My question is... do you like the idea? Would you use it? What would be THE killer feature for you personally? 

Lets talk!

His MindSys provided a soft outline of the room: the edge of the breakfast bar, the close‑set stools, the short distances between walls — a vague, background sense beneath conscious awareness while most of his focus remained anchored in the virtual world.

His dad sat on one of the floating stools, a forgotten mug of coffee warming itself automatically in his hand, his back turned to the table as he leaned toward the wall. He was just as absent as his son, absorbed in the shifting headlines and video feeds glowing across the walls, the room currently washed in a warning red.

His mum stood at the worktop, sorting through food cartridges of different sizes, each printed with idealised images of what they would become once processed. She chose three omelette cartridges and a jam‑toast cartridge, sliding them into the food station built into the counter. A few seconds later they popped back out, cool to the touch. She opened the omelette cartridges, steam rising instantly, and set one in front of Corrin as he sat down at the breakfast bar. The jam‑toast went to his older sister, who was lost in her own virtual world, chatting with the same group she would be seeing at college in under an hour.

“Eat up,” his mum said gently as she set the cartridges down. His sister didn’t respond.  
Corrin managed a small nod.

“George,” she said, trying to get her husband’s attention. Nothing.

She tried again, louder and firmer. “George.”  
This time he blinked, dragging his attention away from the glowing headlines.

“So you think it’s safe for them to be going in today?”

George rubbed at his strained eyes, flicking them back to the wall for a moment before answering.  
“Yeah, yeah, it’s fine. The fallout was overnight, in the capital. It’s all calmed down now.” He was already turning back to the feed before he finished speaking.

His mum pressed her lips together, then turned back to the counter. The room settled into silence again, the soft hum of appliances the only sound that remained. Corrin usually appreciated the quiet, and today he was even more grateful for it; his throbbing head only seemed to worsen as each minute passed.

He ate what little he could stomach, leaving most of the omelette untouched. He drifted through the abstract virtual space hovering in his vision. When he reached out, a glass rose from the table and filled itself; he stopped it halfway and took a sip of the carbonated, impossible‑to‑describe dark blue drink.

An alert pulsed in his head. What should have been a soft nudge instead spiking through his already‑throbbing headache, disorientating him for a moment and almost making him lose his grip on the glass.

Notice: Optimal journey route beginning in 5 minutes

::exit::

The virtual world vanished instantly. Corrin blinked his eyes open, returning to reality. He placed his glass back down and the table reclaimed it at once. The MindSys HUD, a constant presence in both the virtual and real world, hovered at the edges of his vision, its readouts and charts all showing everything to be at full health: the system, his body, his brain.

So why did he feel so bad?

Original post: So context. A month ago a senior at my school (18F) who is known for about a week confessed that they like (as in want to date) me (15M). This senior knew that I'm 15, that I'm a gay guy, and that I don't want to be in a relationship. They also punched my shoulder, and just was touchy in general. Due to past issues I had a pretty bad breakdown after that happened (I politely told them I wasn't interested). Back to now. They sit with my friends and me in the morning despite none of us inviting them to do so and they're making me really uncomfortable. They're also in my 8th hour. I don't know how to tell them I don't want them around me anymore because I don't want to sound mean, I don't even know if this is just me overreacting. 

I'd like to add onto the original since something happened this morning. My school sells coffee from the library. This morning when I went in I saw the person in there so I waited around 5 minutes (since getting the coffee takes 1-2 minutes) so they could leave. When I went in they were literally waiting for me there. I'm sure of this since they already had their coffee and there wasn't anyone else in the library and they weren't even talking to the librarian. I ignored them the entire time except for telling them to just head out since I'm waiting for a friend. They continued to stand there despite me ignoring them. They also called my friend group (which they have never been a part of) a posse and that they were just a side character in my life. I really do feel like I'm overreacting and I feel like if I tell them to stop I'm being a dick. Please give any advice on what to do. I don't want to involve teachers or the office because I'm scared. Thanks for any advice. ",1,1767823008.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

# The Goal: Testing the Limits of Context Engineering

I wanted to see how far I could push modern AI agents (specifically Google's **Antigravity**) in architecting a complete, production-ready application. Instead of just asking for snippets, I treated the AI as a lead architect and lead dev. We explored ""Context Engineering""—maintaining a massive, complex project state entirely within the AI's operational context to build something that isn't just a ""TODO list"" but a robust system.

We come together, like 4 times a year and play such a tournament with like 16 to 20 teams. Orchestration of it was a mess all the time. So i started to develop it. First just for us, then i made it public.

# Meet [beerpong-manager.com](https://beerpong-manager.com)

As said, it’s a specialized tool for running beer pong tournaments.

* **Live Standings**: Groups and brackets update in real-time as scores are entered.
* **Zero Friction**: No login required. No subscriptions. No ""create an account to see your stats.""
* **Shareable Links**: One URL for the admin, one for the big screen, one for the guests.
* **Different modes** to run the tournament

# The Tech & Development ""AI-First""

The app was developed using **Antigravity**, leveraging Google Services for the heavy lifting.

* **Architecture**: 100% Serverless.
* **Compute**: Shifted to the edge (your device). Brackets, group logic, and standings are calculated on the client's CPU. The cloud is just a passive, high-speed data store.
* **Firestore**: Used as the backbone for real-time synchronization.
* **App Check & reCAPTCHA**: Integrated depth-first to prevent bot spam and unauthorized API access without needing a traditional login system.
* Functions for stats calculation and house keeping

# Performance & Theoretical Scale

By moving ""compute to the device"" and using Firestore just for state storage, the scaling limits are insane.

* **The Math**: Firestore's baseline is 10k writes/second. If a match lasts \~10 mins and has 5 updates, that's roughly **1.2 million simultaneous matches** supported by a single project.
* **Listeners**: With 1 million concurrent real-time connections, a massive stadium could watch the same tournament with sub-second latency.

# Security Without Login (And Anti-Bot)

How do you secure an app with no accounts?

1. **Secret Document Hashing**: Sensitive admin tokens are stored in private ""secret"" collections.
2. **SHA-256 Protocol**: When an admin joins via a link, the client hashes the token and sends it for verification via Firestore rules using cross-document get() checks.
3. **Bot Defense**: Integrated **Firebase App Check** with **reCAPTCHA Enterprise** to ensure that only our genuine web app can talk to the database—effectively blocking scripts and automated scrapers.
4. **Entropy**: Tournament IDs use 12-character alphanumeric strings ($3.22 \\times 10\^{21}$ combinations), making them mathematically unguessable.

1q6sp49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1q6sp49/aio_completey_cut_a_friends_out_of_my_life_wasnt/,AIO - Completey cut a 'Friend's out of my life (wasn't nice about it),"So I met this girl in my teen years and we got along well for the few times we happened to be doing the same event, camp, what not. I thought she was a nice, funny girl who was a bit awkward, and seemed to me personally somewhat autistic despite her being adamant she wasn't. (Lacked social awareness, special interests etc. Diagnosed Tisim Risim myself so was a takes one to know one vibe).

Anyway we hung a few times and once she was old enough to go out drinking we went out a few times together, went to her birthdays and we would talk about our latest crushes and situations going on, just girly things. 

However as I do with everyone I've met who I see as a potential friend I warn them early on that I am somewhat flakey, a home body and won't be the type of friend you get coffee with regularly, spends heaps of time with and so on. I do really love and care for my friends and honestly wouldn't mind seeing them more now that I'm a grown adult, we just all live in different towns and in different life stages. Basically I wanted people to know my boundaries and also know what to expect when you're friends with me so they can chose early on what level of effort they want to put in.

This girl however was the show up at your house at random times, message all the time, constantly asking to hang out etc. I really tried to establish my boundaries but when she showed up at my house (parents house) at 3.a.m. wanting to chat and hang out despite me not seeing or responding to her messages it all just made me anxious and rather annoyed. (Have underlining reasons as to why my boundaries really matter and I explained this to her.)

She also started to sleep with this guy at her work who was married, had one kid already and his wife was pregnant. She seemed somewhat happy with herself and while I did my share of displeasing things in my late teens, early 20s, I wasn't going out and happily being part of ruining a family and on going affairs because I wanted to feel sexy and desired. It starting putting me off her as a person more so than the issues with my personal boundaries. I understand the married man is more at fault here but if you know and happily go along you're still in the wrong yourself.

So I stopped hanging out with her, admittedly I ghosted her and felt shit about it but I felt completely disrespected and had already explained everything. Alongside not wanting to hear all about her affair.

Low and behold a few years later she starts showing up to the same drinking nights as me because she was ""seeing"" one of the guys who attended. I was attending because my brother was apart of it, same with my partner's brother and I had been somewhat involved with the group since 18 and also the group had a friend pass away who I had known since a young teen and we were all kind of gathering around to heal and deal with the situation. I decided to give her a chance to see if she's grown as it's been some time and started to reestablish our friendship.

I told her I don't like hugs, she hugged me anyway stating she knows I don't like them but she wants to do it anyway.

She kept leaning on me, being kind of weird and I had to dish out some life advice every now and then while just wanting to mourn the loss of a young life and quietly slip back into my alcoholism. 

She starts causing drama as she's wanting the guy from the friend group to establish their relationship while he's going through grieving the loss of his younger brother. Like she would do that whole sit quietly looking sad, try to talk to him outside, run off crying and then suddenly sprint back and hide blah blah. Queen drama. Basically she didn't seem to care about the bigger picture and was only caring about herself and her fragile emotions.

Meanwhile all that's happening she's telling me she still loves the married guy from her work and doesn't know who to chose. Like wtf, you're going to emotionally drain and mess with a guy who's grieving while still happily partaking in ruining a family. Okay, cool. 

AND THEN, once I take a step back from the group as I only liked thoes who were originally apart of it back in the day I find out she also slept with my brother who she knew was in a relationship too. Shame on my brother and everything he had done, but like if you were wanting to be my friend, ignoring my boundaries and then sleeping with my brother isn't it.

I lost my shit at her, think I said things along the lines have having to grow up, stop being so insecure you find your worth in sleeping with taken guys, probably called her disgusting and said she knows what she's doing and to stop playing the naive girl, said she's undesirable and is too awkward to been seen as sexual and that guys only go for her because she's so easy. Which while harsh is the main reason most the people she's told me she's slept with has gone for her.

We still sometimes see each other at the gym but we now both just ignore each other. 

I already feel like I definitely over reacted to the final situation that caused me to lose my shit, but overall after everything else added too I'm not sure if I over reacted or waited too long and built up a few years worth of reactions. ",1,1767822379.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.67,False

1q6snnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q6snnq/twelve_point/,Twelve point,"I hadn’t went hunting since my father died. I finally decided to go on a trip as a remembrance of him. On September 15 1992, with my friend Erik. We set out. For 5 miles to our camping spot. On the trail we talked about life, and how much it means to me that he’s out here with me. 

The woods were quiet. Though the crickets were chirping. The larger game made no noise. The birds singing their sweet songs to each other were no where to be heard. The chirping of squirrels and chipmunks jumping from tree to tree, where nowhere to be heard. I thought it was odd but paid no mind to the situation further. 

We finally made it to the stand where my father and I perched atop of. My young life consisting of moving to much, and drinking a soda, while he sipped his coffee. Scaring away any potential bucks, cause I needed to get down and relieve myself of a full bladder, from the copious amount of cans. I stood there reminiscing of my first kill. It wasn’t a clean kill. It ran for another 20 feet before it collapsed and I had to end its suffering with my knife. I made sure to use every part of that deer for what I inflicted upon it. My first young love breaking my heart. And the life I lived with the woman I’m grateful to call my wife. And the loss of my grandparents. 

Tomorrow I would make him proud with all he taught me. But today we set up. Though it was just beans and jerky we ate. It felt good. the nostalgic primal feeling, was a great reminder of the decades we spent together just like this. 

I miss you dad.

4AM we marked out our trail cameras. And we made our way back. Nightly  songbirds were considerably vocal this time of the morning. When the first light dimmed across the landscape. The forest life ceased to exist. The only audible noise was the labored breathing of Erik and I. The wind was blowing though the trees weren’t swaying. Standing like a statue across acres that my eye can comprehend. 

I jumped to the sight of a 12 point pair of antlers  emerged standing behind a brush of grass. I estimated the area of the lungs. Held my breath. And took the shot. It shot up on its hind legs as it passed and fell into the brush. Like a snap of a finger. Life came back to the forest. Satisfied with my kill. I went down to retrieve him. Pushed away the brush, and was met with a small puddle of blood, but no buck. The metallic stench pierced my nose, like the air shifted into a cocktail of molten metal and sulfur. It couldn’t have gotten away, the clearing was too small for us not to notice it leaping away. 

We looked around for the injured animal. We walked about 50 feet from our stand but never saw it again. We ventured out further, another 10 feet, but never found it.  When the daylight dimmed. We decided to fall back to our camp. We’ll find it tomorrow.  I thought.

When I went to bed, the similar sensation of complete silence pierced my ears, the only sounds came from the occasional animal breaking a twig, or climbing one of the trees, or worst of all Erik snoring. 

When I managed to drift off, that pungent odor stung my nose again, and soon after Erik as well

“Aw Jesus, what’s that smell?” He asked. I shrugged my shoulders and grabbed my light, as well as my gun. He did too, we walked out to see the deer starting at us between two trees. Its beady black eyes, fixed on us, as we did to it. The bullet hole on its right shoulder muscle oozed blood in black and shiny red. I guess I had missed. Erik raised his gun, as soon as he raised the barrel to the deers head. The deer bared his teeth and snarled at us. Like it was a wolf. What kinda deer fucking snarls? 

It sprang backwards and galloped. I say galloped, but it was more like a kid doing a bear crawl, but if that kid had bones fused together.  We both looked at each other, confused and a little scared. We both agreed to leave as soon as the morning light came. If that one was like that. How many other deer were? Shit how many other animals? Maybe that’s why nature left. I didn’t sleep well that night. I swear I heard my father’s voice calling me. Like my thoughts earlier were so vivid in my imagination I could hear our conversations actually coming from the tree stand outside.  The “atta boy”s and the “keep your voice down” coming from above me. Hell even the conversations that me and Erik had, just a few hours ago.  It left me confused. So far that I didn’t realize when the sun came up. And Erik already started packing his stuff. Eventually I gained my composure and joined him.

When we started on the trail. I thought I saw that damn deer staring at us. But when I turned my head to focus. It was just weirdly shaped stick. Or a rock that just so happened to be shaped like a deer head off the hills edge. Just halfway from our trucks. We heard yelling coming from the trees. A young woman screaming “HELP” at the top of her lungs. “MY BABY” could be heard after. 

We ran to the voice, but when we reached the sound. She would scream from behind us. Then we would run back. Back and forth back and forth. Until we heard a loud growl from something followed by a crack, then nothing. 

We never found the woman. We panicked and ran. I don’t know where, I don’t know what direction. Dodging trees and roots, rocks and overgrown mounds. The only thing we heard what the stomping of our feet, and the pleading breath. There was a large oak that we passed. Just big enough for our entire bodies to be blocked from sight of one another. When I fully passed it. He was gone. I was quick to stop. Looking at where Erik once was. His footprints just ended. I heard growling from behind me, then above me. I panicked and missed a root, my ankle rolled and 165 pounds crushed into my unsuspecting ankle, and dropped. Focused on my ankle that was already starting to swell. I didn’t notice the drops of blood falling in front of me. But finally I saw it. I looked up, to see my friend’s lifeless corps strung from the tree we passed. And it dropped. Slamming on his head with a sickening snap. If he wasn’t dead then. He is now. 

 

That brings me to now. I don’t think I’ll make it out of here. I haven’t eaten in five days and am getting desperate. And that deer is staring at me behind the brush.",1,1767822300.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

Asking for my husband, myself, and two teenage boys. We have never visited the area. We're trying to find a beach vacation without oppressive heat. Our top priority is to be able to walk from a rental (a condo or house, not a hotel) into a little town with good local seafood. Ideally we'd also be able walk to beaches. Does that combination exist? If not, we'd choose walking to shops/coffee/pub, and drive to a beach. The older teen loves fishing and volleyball, so Smugglers Beach is on our list of places to visit. The younger loves calm ocean swimming. For comparison, Kennebunkport was our Platonic ideal for town walkability, but we found the beaches too rocky, small, and rough. And we love Seaside and Rosemary in Florida, but the heat is no longer bearable, especially in August. Seaside was inspired by Cape Cod, so I'm wondering if the original actually exists, or if it's a simulacrum. Fingers xed Baudrillard can stay out of this. Thanks in advance.

Edited to add: Trying to keep the budget below $5500 for the week if possible. And we will have a car for getting to/from the grocery store and day trips. But we'd like to walk around as much as possible.",0,1767822250.0,CapeCod,6,0.43,False

1q6sjn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_junipars/comments/1q6sjn8/untameable/,Untameable,"Furloughed from employment for the winter, but financially secure, I had told myself I'd volunteer at the community center during my abundance of free-time.

I imagined myself out and about, making friends with a smile and then, satisfied with my sociability and generosity, retreating back to the hovel of my home to get to work on some much needed improvements. 

But almost a month into my fortuitous scheduled unemployment, I've done basically nothing but stare out the window, with interludes of noodling shitty fragments of songs on the guitar and breaks for an entirely reasonable and normal amount of doomscrolling. In one spurious moment of activity, I collected all the coffee mugs and plates around the living room, piled them into the sink with hot and soapy water only to promptly forget I had done so, and sunk back down into the couch. The dishes are still there in that water, cold now, two days later. 

Anyways, these posts are ostensibly about the nature of spiritual realization and you may be wondering what the hell this has to do with anything. To be honest, at this point in the post I'm wondering the same thing. 

Oh yeah, *Untameable* - that's the title. As a lover of words such as primordial purity, spontaneity and pervasiveness, it's easy to get duped by the movement of mind which perverts poetry into some attempt to tame or control.

And that's why if you're a hater, like me, (and I'm pretty sure we're all haters here) this spiritual realization business is going to suck. Because this is already the impunity of the spontaneous expression of primordial purity in total pervasiveness. This is absolute perfection. Bummer, huh? It looks like this. 

To the hater, the miracle of absolute perfection looks imperfect and so the hater issues judgements to correct this sin, but as this is already the impunity of perfection, the hater's existence is unjustified.  So if you let the hater simmer in the fire that is the absence of judgement, the hater will perish, and an absolute forgiveness washes away any remnant of the venom that tried to tame the Untameable. 

Though the dishes will still be dirty, of course. ",2,1767822041.0,u_junipars,0,1.0,False
1q6sjad,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1q6sjad/time_looped_chapter_183/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 183,"Will ended the prediction loop. Despite technically no time having passed from the moment he sat down on the toilet seat, his neck and shoulders felt unusually stiff. Alex had dumped a lot of information on him, more than the goofball would normally share. The only reason for that was that he was left with no other choice.

“Is everyone like Danny?” Will asked his mirror fragment.

As expected, the guide provided no answer.

 

**PREDICTION LOOP**

 

Will found himself standing at the door once more. Counting to ten, the boy left the stall, then went into the corridor. By now the coach was away from the bathroom, engaged in a conversation with a student. That particular occurrence usually occurred once in fifty loops or more.

As a rule, all events within a loop were a perfect copy of those done in the past. The only exceptions were the participants. Their actions were the only chaotic factor, and on occasion even minute changes in behavior caused ripples further down the line.

Ignoring the conversation, Will squeezed by, making his way to the classroom.

The stench was very much there, as was Helen.

“Took you a while,” the girl said as she opened one of the windows.

“Sorry, got distracted with something,” Will muttered a clumsy excuse, then closed the door and rushed to help her.

Each window opened granted access to more fresh air. Along with that, it also reminded the pair of the dangers that awaited them. It would be a while before the contest phase began, but once it did, the city would be aflame again.

Will looked at the city landscape, trying to clear his mind from the conversation of Alex.

“Thinking about the archer?” Helen asked.

The question was completely unexpected. Will had to fight the urge to instinctively defend himself. Helen wasn’t supposed to know what had happened in the paradox loop. Had someone told her about his alliance with the archer?

“Don’t worry. I doubt she’ll risk killing us before the contest phase.”

“Yeah…” Will said. “I wanted to talk to you about that,” he said. “She’s agreed to an unofficial alliance. Provided we survive the first ten contest days.”

“She said that?” Helen seemed more impressed than annoyed. “You sure know how to pull-off miracles.”

Will remained silent.

“Like last loop. You completed the challenge on your own.”

“I doubt it. Without you and Jace, I wouldn’t have reached the tower.”

“I doubt it. The thing is—”

“Fucking coach!” The door swung open, announcing Jace’s arrival. “One more time and I’ll start going through the window!”

Whatever Helen had the intention of saying, it was immediately put on hold as the girl briskly turned around, taking a few steps away from Will.

“Trouble?” she asked in her matter-of-fact voice.

“Usual shit about the game. As if I’d ever see that.” He jock slammed the door. “Anyway, what were you talking about?”

“I’ll be giving Will my paladin token,” Helen said without a hint of hesitation or delay. “Knight is close enough, and I don’t want to dilute it.”

If Will hadn’t acquired the residual nature of several of his copycat classes, he would have stared at her. The ease with which she lied was impressive, but more than that, her logic was completely wrong. Paladin was a perfect complement to her class. There was no reason for her to give it up … unless she knew something that Will didn’t.

“For free?” Jace glanced at Will then back at Helen. “You know how much one of these costs? You can—”

“It’s done. And I was hoping you’d do the same, given that neither of us did any actual work.”

“Nah.” It wasn’t Jace’s style to give something up just like that, even if he didn’t particularly need it. “I’ll trade it to you for an equivalent.” He took out his mirror fragment and retrieved the token from it. “With interest,” he tossed it to Will.

Three tokens for a single challenge? It sounded too good to be true, and given the inevitable strings attached, there would be some sort of other price. The question was whether the price was worth paying.

“Guess I’ll owe you one,” Will said. “Both of you.”

“You need the flail?” Jace asked.

“For a bit.” Will went back to his desk. On the way, he glanced over the scribbles Danny had made. Nearly all of them made sense. The song lyrics remained a question, though not something he should be concerned with for now. “The archer agreed to give us a hand during the contest phase,” he went back to matters he knew he could control. “Given that we make it past day ten, we’ll enter an informal alliance.”

“In exchange for what?”

“We’ll probably serve as bait,” Will replied.

“So, same deal as before.” The jock grunted.

“Almost. The goal is to get to the reward phase. After that…” Will paused. “Well, we’ll see what follows.”

The door opened again. The time for discussing eternity matters was over. Quickly the classroom filled up, after which the art lesson began.

Trying to clear his mind, Will decided to actually pay attention for once. He knew what the assignment was; after so many times, he could practically draw it in his sleep. For that reason, he chose to try something new.

Artistic skills acquired through hundreds of loops streamed down his fingers as a supernatural world took shape. The boy might not have started thinking about anything in particular, but after a while he found himself drawing a fight between Danny and the archer.

“That’s not the task,” the teacher said as he glanced over the sketch.

This was the part of class in which the man would roam the classroom, commenting on the students’ progress or the lack of.

“But it’s…” The man shook his head. “You’ve never shown me anything like this before.”

“I didn’t feel it was good enough to show,” Will lied.

“It’s good. It’s definitely good.”

The teacher moved closer to get a better look. The unexpected attention had piqued the interest of the entire class. Several of them had abandoned their own art attempts and moved to see what the fuss was about.

“What is it?” the man asked.

“Dreams…” Will kept on drawing. “A fight scene… I’m not sure.”

“Well, definitely keep at it. Do you have any other sketches? I’d like to see them. You might have a real talent there.”

“Sure, teach. I’ll bring them next week.”

There never was going to be a next week. All this was just a way to pass the boredom. The act continued until the next period. Grabbing his stuff, Will quickly rushed out of the classroom. This was the point at which he needed to have a longer talk with the rest of his party. By the looks of it, it wasn’t going to be now. Jace was busy discussing trash and football with his jock friends, and Helen was with her clique. Any strategy planning was going to have to wait.

With his loop already extended by several hours, Will had a number of options: he could continue with the class and boost his time even further, he could go have the chat with Alex again, or he could go complete the special challenge he had been avoiding ever since he had returned from the paradox.

“Yo, bro!” Alex emerged from the crowd. “What—”

“Tell him I know,” Will cut the conversation short. “And that I’m in.”

“Bro?” The goofball stared at him. Despite the posture, there was no surprise in his eyes, suggesting that this was just another mirror copy.

“Next loop after school. I’ll send a location.”

Will walked past, making his way towards the exit. Before he could get outside, his phone pinged again. It was another text from Helen.

 

**I know sth that will help us (in the reward phase)**

 

That explained why she had been so generous with the token. Will found it hard to believe that was her only motive. After all, she had used an “us”. Even so, she was one more person who needed to be part of the top ten. And that was a problem. Now, both Alex and Helen were determined to reach the reward phase, each for their own reasons. Jace hadn’t said anything so far, but even if he were to forgo his chance, taking five of the ten ranker spots was a tall order.

 

**Talk @ noon**

 

Will texted back and put his phone away. A few moments later, he grabbed his mirror shard.

 

**I need a favor.**

 

He thought, sending a message along it.

 

**Can we meet?**

 

The past him would have been furious for wasting twenty coins on this sort of thing. That was before he learned about the real prices of eternity. Prices went into the thousands, and the really useful items ranged into the millions, if they could be bought with that currency at all.

 

**Didn’t think you’d write.**

 

The response came.

 

**I must warn you, I’m expensive.**

 

“Of course you are,” Will said beneath his breath.

 

**I’m good for it. Just say where.**

 

The boy held his breath.

 

**The place we faced the goblins. 15 minutes**

 

*Shit!* Will broke into a sprint.

That was a reference to the gas station the goblin squire had emerged from. The place wasn’t all that far away, but reaching it in fifteen minutes would be impossible for an ordinary person.

*Conceal!*

Will kept on running, swerving around hundreds of people along the way. None of them saw or even noticed the boy run past. At most, some would feel something brush against them, concluding it had to be the wind. Cars and other vehicles were the only exceptions, which was why Will leaped over any street on the way. It would be stupid if the loop came to an end because he was hit by a car.

By the time he reached the gas station, a queue had already formed. Many of the people Will already knew from the time he had chased after the squire. The biker wasn’t there, much to Will’s relief, although Spenser was.

Passing by, Will went to the table section and took a seat. The queue seemed to drag on for hours, but finally Spenser arrived.

“Got you a drink,” he said, placing a paper cup with a questionable brand name in front of Will. He had also taken a smaller one for himself.

“You actually drink that?” Will asked.

“Keeps me grounded,” the man replied and took a sip. “What do you have to offer?” he asked directly.

“A favor,” Will replied. “When you need information or a challenge done, I’ll—”

“We’re done,” Spenser interrupted. “You don’t have anything I can’t get.”

“Are you sure?”

The certainty in the boy’s voice kept the man from standing up. Nine times out of ten, Will was bluffing, but there was always that one out of ten that could end up being worth it.

“What do you know?”

“Before that, I want to be sure that you’ll help me,” Will insisted. “No freebies, remember?”

Spenser chuckled, then took another sip of his coffee.

“What am I supposed to help with?”

“I want you to guard me. I’ll pick a place that’s difficult to reach, but I want to be sure I’m unharmed.”

“Who did you piss off?”

“No one. But I don’t want to risk it.”

“It’ll either cost you more than it’s worth, or there’s a lot you aren’t telling me. Either way, I don’t want to get involved. Use your wolf.” He stood up. “Keep the drink.”

“I have a clairvoyant skill,” Will quickly said.

The admission had the desired effect. Normally, that would be saying too much, but given that Will remained in a prediction loop, he wasn’t tipping his hand; not really, anyway.

“Keep talking.” The man sat back down.

“I need you to guard my body while I use it.”

“Prediction?”

Will nodded.

“Aren’t you the valuable commodity…”

*You bet I am.*

“And my favor?”

“When you want something done, I’ll use a prediction loop to do it for you. You’ll have to guard me again while I do it.”

“A task of my choice for two loops acting as bodyguard. Of course, you’ll have to get a bit stronger.”

“No time limit. I’ll owe you until I pay up. Might be this phase or in a hundred.”

“Alright. Is this connected with the reward phase?”

“Sort of. There’s a special hidden challenge I need to complete.”

“That’s a bit vague.”

“The Eye of Insight,” Will said. “I plan to get it.”

Upon hearing that, the man looked around. Fear flashed all over his face, as if he’d just learned that someone had put a price on his head.

“Never say such things casually,” Spenser whispered.

“Why?”

“Still a rookie? People will kill…” his words trailed off. For several seconds he kept staring at Will, determining whether to compliment him or kill him. Finally, he straightened his suit jacket. “Prediction loop.”

Will nodded.

“You’ve learned a few things after all. When can I expect a real meeting?”

“Today. Do you have a way to help me skip all this?”

“Just say Cassandra and tell me I told you. We’ll work out the rest afterwards.”

“Nice doing business with you.” Will ended the prediction loop.

For context, I’m a minimalist just like many of my friends, and therefore spacious rooms are a huge thing.

Mostly my house is full of functional fixtures, say a coffee table that also doubles as a storage unit. Ofcos the storage compartment is underneath the table top. If it’s the bed, then an additional storage compartment underneath as well. I think you get the idea of where I’m going with this.

For shoes, I’ve been using a traditional rack as I don’t have many shoes in the first place, I tend to keep it simple. But after the hype I got from friends, I’m quite tempted into getting those ultra thin shoe cabinets. I know I should ask my friends about this but I don’t want to get their biased opinion. I’d rather ask here and receive genuine reaction and experience from those who have used it.

I’ve already researched a couple of different types and designs (on alibaba and amazon) and yet to settle on any in particular until I know what I’m getting myself into. So I’ll appreciate your feedback, thank you.",1,1767822003.0,FurnitureDupes,0,1.0,False

“Took you a while,” the girl said as she opened one of the windows.

“Sorry, got distracted with something,” Will muttered a clumsy excuse, then closed the door and rushed to help her.

Each window opened granted access to more fresh air. Along with that, it also reminded the pair of the dangers that awaited them. It would be a while before the contest phase began, but once it did, the city would be aflame again.

Will looked at the city landscape, trying to clear his mind from the conversation of Alex.

“Thinking about the archer?” Helen asked.

The question was completely unexpected. Will had to fight the urge to instinctively defend himself. Helen wasn’t supposed to know what had happened in the paradox loop. Had someone told her about his alliance with the archer?

“Don’t worry. I doubt she’ll risk killing us before the contest phase.”

“Yeah…” Will said. “I wanted to talk to you about that,” he said. “She’s agreed to an unofficial alliance. Provided we survive the first ten contest days.”

“She said that?” Helen seemed more impressed than annoyed. “You sure know how to pull-off miracles.”

Will remained silent.

“Like last loop. You completed the challenge on your own.”

“I doubt it. Without you and Jace, I wouldn’t have reached the tower.”

“I doubt it. The thing is—”

“Fucking coach!” The door swung open, announcing Jace’s arrival. “One more time and I’ll start going through the window!”

Whatever Helen had the intention of saying, it was immediately put on hold as the girl briskly turned around, taking a few steps away from Will.

“Trouble?” she asked in her matter-of-fact voice.

“Usual shit about the game. As if I’d ever see that.” He jock slammed the door. “Anyway, what were you talking about?”

“I’ll be giving Will my paladin token,” Helen said without a hint of hesitation or delay. “Knight is close enough, and I don’t want to dilute it.”

If Will hadn’t acquired the residual nature of several of his copycat classes, he would have stared at her. The ease with which she lied was impressive, but more than that, her logic was completely wrong. Paladin was a perfect complement to her class. There was no reason for her to give it up … unless she knew something that Will didn’t.

“For free?” Jace glanced at Will then back at Helen. “You know how much one of these costs? You can—”

“It’s done. And I was hoping you’d do the same, given that neither of us did any actual work.”

“Nah.” It wasn’t Jace’s style to give something up just like that, even if he didn’t particularly need it. “I’ll trade it to you for an equivalent.” He took out his mirror fragment and retrieved the token from it. “With interest,” he tossed it to Will.

Three tokens for a single challenge? It sounded too good to be true, and given the inevitable strings attached, there would be some sort of other price. The question was whether the price was worth paying.

“Guess I’ll owe you one,” Will said. “Both of you.”

“You need the flail?” Jace asked.

“For a bit.” Will went back to his desk. On the way, he glanced over the scribbles Danny had made. Nearly all of them made sense. The song lyrics remained a question, though not something he should be concerned with for now. “The archer agreed to give us a hand during the contest phase,” he went back to matters he knew he could control. “Given that we make it past day ten, we’ll enter an informal alliance.”

“In exchange for what?”

“We’ll probably serve as bait,” Will replied.

“So, same deal as before.” The jock grunted.

“Almost. The goal is to get to the reward phase. After that…” Will paused. “Well, we’ll see what follows.”

The door opened again. The time for discussing eternity matters was over. Quickly the classroom filled up, after which the art lesson began.

Trying to clear his mind, Will decided to actually pay attention for once. He knew what the assignment was; after so many times, he could practically draw it in his sleep. For that reason, he chose to try something new.

Artistic skills acquired through hundreds of loops streamed down his fingers as a supernatural world took shape. The boy might not have started thinking about anything in particular, but after a while he found himself drawing a fight between Danny and the archer.

“That’s not the task,” the teacher said as he glanced over the sketch.

This was the part of class in which the man would roam the classroom, commenting on the students’ progress or the lack of.

“But it’s…” The man shook his head. “You’ve never shown me anything like this before.”

“I didn’t feel it was good enough to show,” Will lied.

“It’s good. It’s definitely good.”

The teacher moved closer to get a better look. The unexpected attention had piqued the interest of the entire class. Several of them had abandoned their own art attempts and moved to see what the fuss was about.

“What is it?” the man asked.

“Dreams…” Will kept on drawing. “A fight scene… I’m not sure.”

“Well, definitely keep at it. Do you have any other sketches? I’d like to see them. You might have a real talent there.”

“Sure, teach. I’ll bring them next week.”

There never was going to be a next week. All this was just a way to pass the boredom. The act continued until the next period. Grabbing his stuff, Will quickly rushed out of the classroom. This was the point at which he needed to have a longer talk with the rest of his party. By the looks of it, it wasn’t going to be now. Jace was busy discussing trash and football with his jock friends, and Helen was with her clique. Any strategy planning was going to have to wait.

With his loop already extended by several hours, Will had a number of options: he could continue with the class and boost his time even further, he could go have the chat with Alex again, or he could go complete the special challenge he had been avoiding ever since he had returned from the paradox.

“Yo, bro!” Alex emerged from the crowd. “What—”

“Tell him I know,” Will cut the conversation short. “And that I’m in.”

“Bro?” The goofball stared at him. Despite the posture, there was no surprise in his eyes, suggesting that this was just another mirror copy.

“Next loop after school. I’ll send a location.”

Will walked past, making his way towards the exit. Before he could get outside, his phone pinged again. It was another text from Helen.

 

**I know sth that will help us (in the reward phase)**

 

That explained why she had been so generous with the token. Will found it hard to believe that was her only motive. After all, she had used an “us”. Even so, she was one more person who needed to be part of the top ten. And that was a problem. Now, both Alex and Helen were determined to reach the reward phase, each for their own reasons. Jace hadn’t said anything so far, but even if he were to forgo his chance, taking five of the ten ranker spots was a tall order.

 

**Talk @ noon**

 

Will texted back and put his phone away. A few moments later, he grabbed his mirror shard.

 

**I need a favor.**

 

He thought, sending a message along it.

 

**Can we meet?**

 

The past him would have been furious for wasting twenty coins on this sort of thing. That was before he learned about the real prices of eternity. Prices went into the thousands, and the really useful items ranged into the millions, if they could be bought with that currency at all.

 

**Didn’t think you’d write.**

 

The response came.

 

**I must warn you, I’m expensive.**

 

“Of course you are,” Will said beneath his breath.

 

**I’m good for it. Just say where.**

 

The boy held his breath.

 

**The place we faced the goblins. 15 minutes**

 

*Shit!* Will broke into a sprint.

That was a reference to the gas station the goblin squire had emerged from. The place wasn’t all that far away, but reaching it in fifteen minutes would be impossible for an ordinary person.

*Conceal!*

Will kept on running, swerving around hundreds of people along the way. None of them saw or even noticed the boy run past. At most, some would feel something brush against them, concluding it had to be the wind. Cars and other vehicles were the only exceptions, which was why Will leaped over any street on the way. It would be stupid if the loop came to an end because he was hit by a car.

By the time he reached the gas station, a queue had already formed. Many of the people Will already knew from the time he had chased after the squire. The biker wasn’t there, much to Will’s relief, although Spenser was.

Passing by, Will went to the table section and took a seat. The queue seemed to drag on for hours, but finally Spenser arrived.

“Got you a drink,” he said, placing a paper cup with a questionable brand name in front of Will. He had also taken a smaller one for himself.

“You actually drink that?” Will asked.

“Keeps me grounded,” the man replied and took a sip. “What do you have to offer?” he asked directly.

“A favor,” Will replied. “When you need information or a challenge done, I’ll—”

“We’re done,” Spenser interrupted. “You don’t have anything I can’t get.”

“Are you sure?”

The certainty in the boy’s voice kept the man from standing up. Nine times out of ten, Will was bluffing, but there was always that one out of ten that could end up being worth it.

“What do you know?”

“Before that, I want to be sure that you’ll help me,” Will insisted. “No freebies, remember?”

Spenser chuckled, then took another sip of his coffee.

“What am I supposed to help with?”

“I want you to guard me. I’ll pick a place that’s difficult to reach, but I want to be sure I’m unharmed.”

“Who did you piss off?”

“No one. But I don’t want to risk it.”

“It’ll either cost you more than it’s worth, or there’s a lot you aren’t telling me. Either way, I don’t want to get involved. Use your wolf.” He stood up. “Keep the drink.”

“I have a clairvoyant skill,” Will quickly said.

The admission had the desired effect. Normally, that would be saying too much, but given that Will remained in a prediction loop, he wasn’t tipping his hand; not really, anyway.

“Keep talking.” The man sat back down.

“I need you to guard my body while I use it.”

“Prediction?”

Will nodded.

“Aren’t you the valuable commodity…”

*You bet I am.*

“And my favor?”

“When you want something done, I’ll use a prediction loop to do it for you. You’ll have to guard me again while I do it.”

“A task of my choice for two loops acting as bodyguard. Of course, you’ll have to get a bit stronger.”

“No time limit. I’ll owe you until I pay up. Might be this phase or in a hundred.”

“Alright. Is this connected with the reward phase?”

“Sort of. There’s a special hidden challenge I need to complete.”

“That’s a bit vague.”

“The Eye of Insight,” Will said. “I plan to get it.”

Upon hearing that, the man looked around. Fear flashed all over his face, as if he’d just learned that someone had put a price on his head.

“Never say such things casually,” Spenser whispered.

“Why?”

“Still a rookie? People will kill…” his words trailed off. For several seconds he kept staring at Will, determining whether to compliment him or kill him. Finally, he straightened his suit jacket. “Prediction loop.”

Will nodded.

“You’ve learned a few things after all. When can I expect a real meeting?”

“Today. Do you have a way to help me skip all this?”

“Just say Cassandra and tell me I told you. We’ll work out the rest afterwards.”

“Nice doing business with you.” Will ended the prediction loop.

To maximize engagement from people looking for an immediate financial lifeline, the language needs to feel **urgent, exclusive, and effortless**. By removing the specific technical steps and focusing on the ""transformation"" (from $0 to $350), you create a high-curiosity gap that forces them to engage to find out how.

Here is a modernized version designed to trigger that emotional response:

1q6sgca,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1q6sgca/saw_my_ex_21f_hiding_from_me_19m_outside_class/,Saw my ex (21F) hiding from me (19M) outside class twice this week.,"Hey everyone, looking for some outside perspective on a post-breakup college situation.

My ex (21F) and I (19M) broke up a couple months ago. She ended it, and she was super respectful about it. No big fights, no cheating, just wasn’t working anymore. We go to the same university, and this semester we have back-to-back classes in the same room a couple days a week. Her class ends right as mine starts, so we naturally cross paths in the doorway/hallway.

The first time this week, she bolted out super fast as soon as class let out. The second time, I got there at my usual time and saw her literally waiting around the corner of the door, peeking to see if I was coming before she left. As soon as she spotted me, she turned and walked the other way.

It’s clear she’s uncomfortable running into me and is actively trying to avoid that awkward moment. I don’t want to make her feel anxious or like she has to hide a couple days a week, so I’m thinking about just coming to the building 5-10 minutes later (grab a coffee, chill somewhere else) so she can leave without worrying.

Part of me feels like I shouldn’t have to change my routine, but the bigger part thinks it’s the kindest thing to do since she’s obviously stressed about it. We’re both adults, the breakup wasn’t messy, and I’m not trying to get her back. I just want campus to feel normal for both of us.

What do you think is the best way to handle this? Anyone been in a similar “same classroom” situation and figured out what worked?

1q6sfvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DivaythStories/comments/1q6sfvl/jedi_jimmy/,Jedi Jimmy,"[\[OT\] Fun Trope Friday: Gold Digger & Romance! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1p36hau/comment/nqsqf08/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
Jedi Jimmy was shuffling around town, trying to shield. You couldn't get to his mind if you tried, but some woman was looking at him.

He lived in his Winter Palace, and nobody nowhere knew nothing about it. He’d found it by accident years before, behind the bookstore. Kicked some bricks loose, and behind them was revealed a narrow hallway, or store room, or whatever, all bricked up and nobody knew it.

He had stacked up the bricks again, panicking, hoping nobody was looking. Later, he had fixed it, looking up how on the youtube at the library, and made a little door. It didn’t look like a door, but it was one.

In his Winter Palace he kept his millions, and all manner of luxuries. There was even a plug for the electric, but he was sparing with it. Just a little nightlight sometimes, when the wind was dead voices in the dark.

The hall was hung with rich tapestries, some plain, some depicting the Spider Man or the Hulk Man. One of them had the Dark Vader on it, which that was a bad robot man from the Jedi movies. Folks said he was a Jedi, with his bathrobes and his beard. The old one. Opie somebody. Didn’t matter. Jedi Jimmy’s name was Frank, and nobody knew that, either.

It was looking like rain and his weather leg was twinging. He really wanted to go home, but some lady was following him around, looking at him. Nice lady, not street. Not a preacher one. Jeans on, looked about forty. What the hell did she want?

She might be a Road To Heller, as he called them. Good intention people, come around being all concerned. They help you right into a nuthouse, and you come back out in seventy-two hours, standing there with a bag of psycho meds and all your stuff gone.

Jedi Jimmy tried to shield from her, with his powers. It didn’t always work. She kept looking and following. *Ain’t gonna find my Winter Palace, woman*. She wanted his millions; she could smell it on him somehow.

He could go in the coffee place. He had his stickup money in his bathrobe but didn’t like to spend it. Got to have that, to satisfy the knifers. Library was a ways off, and maybe closing soon, but yeah. Library was it. He knew a way out of there, a fire door that didn’t set off no alarms.

The back ways were best, especially now, but there wasn’t time. Daylight was wasting. He charged right up Maple, disturbing the regular people, trying to shield. No cops around, so far.

He run into a lady pretty hard, and she went sprawling. Her cookies fell out. He tried to put them back in the Dollar Store bag but she yelled at him. He took off before it got ugly, down around the drug store and into the park. On down a ways, then back up onto Maple. But there she was. The Road To Hell woman, out in front of him.

“Frank? It’s Tammy. Do you remember me?”

How the hell did she know about Frank?

“We went to Roosevelt High together. Are you OK? We dated a little, remember? I just wanted to see–hey! What?”

Jedi Jimmy laid his stickup money on the sidewalk and pulled out his emergency knife. *Take it. Take it, or take this, you ain’t getting my millions*.

The woman stared all weird, and started talking again but it was loud and wrong, it sounded like the dark. Roosevelt was President in the war. Jedi Jimmy waved the knife around. *That’s right. Get away. I won’t sleep outside just because you think we’re Roosevelt*.

He turned and ran, and she didn’t follow any more. He checked and checked, late into the night. She was gone. He put his knife back in his raggy boot, tying it in place.

He went back to his secret door and waited. Quiet and dark behind the store he waited, making sure. Then he twisted and lifted the little brick door, and pulled it back in place behind him.

Inside were glittering jewels and gold, furs and rare masterpieces, found by his discerning eye at the Goodwill shop, or even in dumpsters. Thick stacks of cash were everywhere. They said it was fake play money, but they didn’t know everything. He arranged himself on his luxurious mattress.

The reason im bringing this up is I know a lot of people now struggle to find people to hangout with and make friends, well back in the 2010s this is what we'd do to meet people, we'd go out with like minded people and make friends with them.

For example if you like anime, and you know someone who like anime you call them and make plans to watch anime togheter, I met a lot of my long term friendships ghir f cyber coffee kan9sro Dofus back in the day. you guys have no idea how easy it is to make friends. all you need is a group with shared interests. 

this brings me to the issue.

The problem today is a lot of us are being forced to adapt to a reality that is not compatible with us, most of us millennials and Gen Z don't really resemble our parents, I'm sorry but if you like football like your father, know that a lot of people don't even care about it and prefer to play video games instead. and there are a lot of people who are stuck in their houses not being able to connect to people. bcs society is not catering for them anymore.

The lack of social events that are made specifically for that demography is causing people to socially isolate themselves and eventually develop social anxiety and depression, a lot of them become N.E.E.T after they lose all contact from reality. and the numbers are disturbing (I7sa2 diyal 2024)... 

If you're reading this, and you happen to fall in this issue, know that there is a world outside that is way more interesting than it looks, and people are just people. no matter how tough they look, they often get uncomfortable after 5 seconds of eye contact... we all have the same fears at the end of the day.

You are not broken, you are not alone. you deserve to live life.

Since arriving, they have taken to bartering on the price of everything and what at first started off as something my partner and I found funny and somewhat endearing is now becoming embarrassing.

The first night they stayed with us in the UK, they ordered take out for us all off my phone. When it arrived, my FIL suggested - and I initially thought this was a joke - that we tell UberEats that the food arrived cold so we’d get some money back or a discount off our next order. This food literally arrived piping hot, like when we opened the plastic lid of the container, steam was billowing out. We laughed and said there was no need to do that and it could also run the risk of the driver or restaurant getting in trouble when they did nothing wrong. 

Staying with us they’ve been a delight but whenever we go out, it’s a problem. My MIL will order a coffee and then complain to the barista that it wasn’t made right and she’d like another one… for free…. meanwhile myself (and the barista for that matter) can see she’s sunk half of it, essentially netting her self 1.5 coffees. 

I spoke to my partner about it and she’s said that it’s a cultural difference: they’re used to bartering for a better deal. I could somewhat understand that if we were at a market selling knock off goods or at a car boot sale but not just buying regular, normal things most people buy.

The last straw for me was yesterday when we had snow where we live and my FIL was ill-prepared for the weather, so he went out and bought a ski jacket. He’s kept the tags on so he “can take it back in 30 days when the weather is better”. I’m so embarrassed as we’ve even had strangers come up to him on the street to tell him the tags are poking out, thinking they’re being helpful. 

How can I broach the subject matter with them without offending them and get them to stop?

I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using appss helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

What methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!

Hope this helps you as it did for me, I wish all of you the best in this 2026!",3,1767820751.0,selfimprovement,3,0.8,False

[Here's a link to a more navigable version that isn't hitting the character limit. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18MyiO-qN1Dfc8SRkh2DDZgp6kjek5DV213X3AISTh50/edit?usp=sharing)

TL;DR: This is just my fun envisioning of how I'd improve Veilguard to fit the spirit of the original games. If you generally agree with some of my introduction, maybe you'll find the rest of it interesting. If diving into hours of text on theories and Dragon Age lore isn't your idea of fun, then this probably isn't your jam. But maybe there's a handful of people on this subreddit that would like to nerd out with me and give some feedback. 

Hello fellow Dragon Age fans, 

It's been well over a year now since Veilguard’s release and like many of us I’m still mourning what could have been. I was one of the fans who felt like Veilguard was OK, but deeply disappointed that it's what Bioware gave us after so long a wait and understanding that this was the final chance for the IP to survive. I am a Dragon Age mega nerd who has consumed just about every available form of media - the games and all DLC, the comics, the show, the radio show, the books, the World of Thedas Encyclopedias, and even skimmed TTRPG guide just in the off chance it contained some more interesting lore. I’ve read quite a few most-mortems online, along with imagined changes. I’m throwing my own manifesto into the ring to see what some other mega-fans think. 

While I think most of us feel Veilguard fell short, and we are unlikely to see any more entries or media from the IP unless a new studio rescues it, one of the few ways we can keep the fandom alive is by reimagining what could have been. I doubt this will really catch on due to the wall of text, but I’d love for a few people to read it and give their thoughts.

I will not be adding spoiler text - assume this is all just a massive Veilguard spoiler. This is a 22 page document and I just don't have the time to block out every spoiler.

# I. Introduction - Where I Think Bioware Went Wrong

In my opinion what they produced wasn’t a bad game, but it also wasn’t really a Dragon Age. This contradiction has been sitting with me for well over a year now, as I believe the devs were true fans of the IP. Obviously the game was pulled in so many directions, it is a miracle that we got the product we did, and I’m grateful to at least have something that seems to have provided some closure. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that so much of the Veilguard felt like a juvenile RP in the setting even when there was an undeniable effort to create a dark and apocalyptic narrative. Some of this is clearly Bioware and EA’s fault, as they tried to appeal to a wider audience, but I cannot deny that the writers are partially at fault as well.

As I’ve reflected on the game, I really do believe that the largest shortcoming of Veilguard was in its tone. I think many of us sensed this in the early trailers, which Bioware tried to assure us would be balanced by grotesque settings that kept the narrative dark. However, this isn’t what defines the complex tone of a Dragon Age game. For me some of the critical components are in complex cultural histories behind international politics, moral ambiguity, and how these play out in the conflict our companions have with themselves, the player, and other party members. This is where I think most criticism hit the mark - these characters got along too well too fast, and the regions and cultures they come from have all been steam cleaned to be more widely accepted. Most of the cast felt as if the intention was to make them feel cozy and quirky, in a misguided attempt to create the “found family” effect of previous ensembles who were more convincing because of how they overcame their prejudices and challenges together. As a result, character dynamics and regional plots were flattened, and conflict was manufactured through two dimensional eldritch villains that were somehow even less complex than Corypheus in Inquisition.

As I’ve imagined my Veilguard revision, I thought it made the most sense to zero in on the companions as avatars of their region or faction. For me, interesting bioware narratives do get some of their strength from complex and interesting villains, but the largest and most fascinating engine of conflict and moral ambiguity comes from the companion groups. It's here we manage to carve out common ground, or see characters come into organic conflict with their initial world views when brought into close proximity with the main character and their fellow party members. The majority of this manifesto will be exploring how I would revise or outright scrap existing companions, how this would impact their region/faction and wider lore implications, and how it would introduce new and interesting conflict into party dynamics. Some of these decisions I imagine are highly controversial. For example, I think Emmerich has some of the best writing and performances out of the entire Veilguard cast, but I would ultimately scrap the character almost entirely and start over in service of a character and setting that better match Dragon Age’s established ethos.

Another factor is that few of our choices carry over. This is where I feel I do have a controversial opinion - I understand the limitations of the team to write and record lines for character or series of choices that may never appear in half of the playthroughs. I do think a majority of the choices have come to satisfying conclusions by the end of Trespasser. I think there are only a few loose threads that would be satisfying to tie, and the vast majority of our choices could be respected in short codex entries with character model cameos I’ll include. I understand that this game needed to find a way to create a soft reset for the series, but I still think we could have had more impactful choices without employing a hard blight reset on all of southern Thedas.

# II. Companions

1. **Nevarran Companion**
   1. **What needs to be changed:** This is probably my most controversial change. Emmerich is obviously one of the strongest characters from a writing and performance angle with a satisfying character arc and one of the best written romances. However, Nevarra stands out uncomfortably from an aesthetic perspective to the rest of the setting. The clothing design is Victorian steampunk medical, and while of course an asynchronous aesthetic is fine in a fantasy setting it is strange that Nevarra possesses the most modern analogue designs for a culture that is supposed to be steeped in tradition and the past. Emmerich is lovely, but he is also cozy and safe, and there is very little friction when it comes to his character outside of his choices to save Manfred or ascend to Lichdom. His nemesis is fascinating, but ultimately Emmerich’s character and setting feel like they actually belong in a different game entirely. In the end, I think Emmerich is just too cute, and there’s only so much room for that in Dragon Age. I think its better used on some other characters like Harding. 
   2. **Reworked Companion:** To add some grit I would lean more towards a spirit companion that the concept art seemed to introduce. This is a reanimated corpse or skeleton - something a little more sinister in aesthetic than Manfred’s charming design. I imagine this corpse has inhabited the Necropolis for some time, perhaps as a spirit of Tradition or Ritual. This character would still give us an “old man” on the team, but he would also be less likeable and stodgy at first. This character would also give us a unique glimpse into the perspective of a spirit companion who has been on this side of the Fade for longer - unlike some of the other companions who are new to the world (Justice, Spite, etc). I actually would not mind if this Necromancer spirit companion still employed a Manfred for the contrast of a “young” spirit that has recently crossed over being mentored by a more ancient one. This would give us a lot more interesting dialogue from an “ex-pat” spirit with unique perspectives. 
   3. **Regional Changes:** A large part of the aesthetic changes I would employ would be centered on shifting the design of Nevarra from Victorian Gothic to some of the Egyptian themes in early concept art. This is a culture that is hyper focused on ancestor worship, recognizing the accomplishments of the Penteghast family, and deeply invested in decorating the dead. The mournwatch aesthetic should more closely resemble a ritualistic Egyptian style - I think it can retain some of the academic elements but I expect more elaborate funerary gold necklaces and other adornments. These should be beautifully designed jewelry that is meant to adorn a body and still appear impressive when the skin has gone away. I don’t mind the aesthetics of much of the Necropolis in the game, but it should feel a little bit more enclosed. The Necropolis should also feel as if it is closer to the fade, with the setting shifting and rooms changing as we explore it. The setting should feel more alive the deeper we go into it - with large expansive rooms serving as a shock. I think we also missed out on seeing the Necropolis as a towering temple complex right next to the Nevarran capital to see how the living Nevarrans go about their days. Instead in Veilguard the Necropolis feels like it exists in a separate and isolated location. Parts of the Necropolis should also feel ironically bustling - we should see large re-annactments of battles that spirits engage in, political campaigns, as well as feasts or other “city” life much like we saw in Minrathous. The Necropolis should feel eerily bursting with life - its just a very different kind of life. All of this should emphasize a point made clear by the short stories - the deeper parts of the necropolis are unknown and alien, and the veil is incredibly thin there. I would have had Solas remain free from the fade in my version of the Veilguard, and The Necropolis should remain a weak point in the veil that would attract both Solas and the Evanuris. This should be what first brings us to the Necropolis. The weakness in the fade could also account for a cameo from whoever was left there in Inquisition. 
   4. **New Conflict:** This character would reintroduce internal conflict into the group in part because they are centered on tradition and inflexibility. As an ancient spirit that has been honored in the necropolis, I imagine it would likely be haughty and difficult initially. It would not like the disruption to its daily life of being forced further into “the living world.” These notes will make more sense as you read about other changes, but this character would have natural conflict with a Qunari companion who is wary of magic but would have fascinating debates with the character about the importance of tradition. Likewise, my revised Lucanis would be deeply untrusting of mages and spirits. Calpurnia might be more respectful of this character as a fellow magic user, but may also believe that spirits are to be used as servants and tools. An ancient elven companion would bond easily with this character due to their shared origins as spirits from the fade. Harding and Davrin are diplomatic towards this character. 
2. **Qunari / Rivaini Companion**
   1. **What needs to be changed:** I don’t think it is controversial at this point to suggest scrapping Taash. While I disagree with a lot of the anti-woke commentary surrounding the debate over this character, I don’t think Taash’s writing or performance was executed well. Taash is grating, which is fine for a start, but I never fully warmed up to them. Taash read developmentally as a teen, even though they are meant to be in their 20s. As an independent and capable young person who has filled the challenging role of helping their adoptive parent adapt to an unfamiliar culture, Taash should seem far more capable and mature beyond their years. This is a common trend I see with children of first generation parents. Instead they are juvenile, and this really hurts the development of their gender queer arc. Krem was by far a better exploration of complex gender dynamics intersecting with Qunari values, but a large part of it was the fact that Krem was appropriately mature beyond his years. Taash is meant to explore the bridge between a character with a traditional Qunari lineage merging with Rivaini culture. Instead we don’t really get to see either. The Lords of Fortune likewise are not developed as a faction at all besides some piratey robin hood types. They tried to give them a little bit more character by shoe-horning Isabella in, but she doesn’t serve any meaningful function narratively and so this remains one of the most underdeveloped regions and factions. In my version, it becomes one of the most narratively critical. 
   2. **Companion Changes:** We replace Taash with a former middle aged Tamassran. This character could have initially been introduced to Rivain as there are established Qunari outposts. Their strongly held beliefs could have been challenged by seeing how Rivaini culture managed to find middle ground between the Qun and existing Seers. Perhaps she befriends a Seer and this leads her to become Tal-Vashoth. Her combat set could lean close combat rogue where she mixes alchemical expertise, herbs, and poisons. We got some interaction with Taash’s mom, but I think more opportunities to speak with someone who has left the Qun and who lived under a branch outside the Antaam would prove incredibly interesting. This character’s arc would be significant not just to themselves as an individual, but also help the development of the surviving Qunari (see changes to Act I). As this character has largely left the Qun, they also support Isabella's Felisima Armada and The Merchant Princes to maintain some level of independence in the region. This is how they become more involved with the Lords of Fortune. They can also be partially motivated by searching for Qunari artifacts to learn more about the origins and development of the Qunari, something that was touched on with Taash’s plot points but could have been brought more to the foreground. As a Qunari, she still has a fascination with Dragons, but I think we can drop the Dragon Hunter and Fire Breathing parts because, personally, I thought that was kind of corny. There is enough already existing lore about the Qunari to explore without adding something new. I recognize the importance of queer representation in Bioware games, so I think there could also be some interesting and more nuanced exploration of what it means to be a Tamassran. Perhaps this character is male bodied, but was assigned to the Tamassran which is a feminine gender role. This could have even been a less than ideal fit, but would have a little more nuance and gravity from an older character who has sat with the contradictions and cultural projections on their gender for a longer period of time. That being said, knowing how controversial Taash was a genderqueer character, I’m sure a buff middle aged trans lady Qunari would make even more heads explode. An exploration of gender might be more appropriate for the spirit companion, ultimately. I think it would be much more interesting for a possessed skeleton to contemplate gender. Particularly if the body is made up of multiple sources.
   3. **Regional Changes:** We would still explore the coast, but there would be an inhabited hub that would allow us to connect with Isabella’s fleet and perhaps get a cameo from Josephine. This group could swing either way in supporting Tevinter or the Qun in Act I’s geopolitical struggle. Exploration of ruins would have a heavier focus on finding remnants of Qunari culture instead of Grey Wardens. Eventually this character and region would have a major impact on the direction of the two remaining branches of the Qun that were abandoned by the Antaam. 
   4. **Conflict:** A Qunari companion raised under the Qun is naturally suspicious of all things fade related. This might be softened by a friendship with a seer, but this would bring them into natural conflict with nearly every member of the party except for Davrin and Lucanis (who in my version would not be an abomination). Add to that the fact that she would have likely identified young mages as part of her duties as a young tamassran. This character would have some interesting conversations and debate about individuality vs community when speaking with Harding (see rework of the Titan hive mind history in her section). She both clearly sees the importance of clear roles and the collective, but has also broken out as an individual to some degree. She would be opposed to the Titan hive minds because of the magical aspects as well as the fact that participants have limited choice - at least those living under the Qun “choose” to do so. 
3. **Minrathous Companion**
   1. **What needs to be changed:** Honestly I really like Neve, but there are much more complex Tevinter nuances to explore. Neve is one of our more grounded characters, and her desire to “save” Tevinter and Minrathous from itself is a great start. But ultimately, she offers very little new perspective to this culture. Dorian had significantly more nuance as a member of the ruling class. Neve gives us little new insight into what it is like to live in Tevinter with its many contradictions. This is especially true due to the way in which Minrathous is white washed by this game. We see that it is a glittering and advanced metropolis, and we can understand the appeal that Tevinter holds as a refuge for mages. But we barely touched on the massive inequities present in Tevinter. We don’t see the massive gulf in class there, how both human and elven slaves live complicated lives. We help the shadow dragons, but rarely get a glimpse into the actual twisted evil of the country. That’s why I propose a character considered in the concept work who could truly capture the good, the bad and the ugly of Tevinter: Calpurnia. 
   2. **Character Changes:** Calpurnia is a perfect vessel to explore Tevinter. She is deeply flawed as a character, yet can still evoke sympathy. Through Calpurnia we can both appreciate the evils of slavery in Tevinter, but also see how she is willing to still maintain those same evils as a human mage. The Calpurnia we meet in Veilguard has begun to assist the shadow dragons, she is lost and reeling from her experience being seduced by Corypheus and misled, and is till angry and hurt. She is trying to turn over a new leaf by dismantling human slavery in Tevinter - but I imagine that Calpurnia would make an interesting allegory for poor whites and racism in America. Though she experienced slavery first hand, she believes she is superior because she is human and a mage. Calpurnia still possesses prejudices against elves, and this might even manifest in her disgust of how the Elven Gods were actually the Old Gods of Tevinter. Calpurnia would join the party as a deeply controversial figure, and extremely difficult to get along with. However, this can present one of the most engaging opportunities for growth as she is forced to interact with the party and open her world view. We could also see some really fascinating conflict between Calpurnia, Dorian, and Maevaris. All three are working to eliminate slavery, but I imagine Calpurnia would have some natural conflict with the other two as privileged members of the Tevinter upper caste trying to pedantically explain slavery to someone who has experienced true suffering under Tevinter’s system. This would introduce an incredibly complex character with a deeply satisfying arc. Dragon Age shines when it gets to focus a spotlight on how WE are often made monsters through existing cultural systems, and Calpurnia would be an excellent way to explore that theme in the series. Calpurnia would give us more nuanced and interesting glimpses into the politics and religion of Tevinter, its reliance on slavery, and also potentially reintroduce blood magic into the party. 
   3. **Regional Changes:** We see a much darker Tevinter with more variety in Minrathous (not just the working class docks). More blood magic, more slaves, more political intrigue. We see a variety of slaves living both in cruelty and squalor as well as comfortable members of extended family. Its criminal that we get almost no exposure to The Archon, or The Black Divine. 
   4. **Conflict:** This Calpurnia has conflict with everyone either due to their status as elves (Davrin, Bellara) or distaste for magic (Lucanis, Tamassran). The most likely companion is the Nevarran spirit, but even this would be colored by Calpurnia’s likely perspective that spirits are to be dominated and used as tools. Harding and Calpurnia still hold grudges against each other for killed companions. Over time, Harding learns to admire her, and they ironically find companionship in having shared this difficult time in their lives. She is naturally antagonistic with the Tamassran due to the Qunari/Tevinter conflict. Davrin is offended by Calpurnia’s racism against elves, but is less emotionally invested. As a grey warden he’s experienced that mindset and appreciates the need for practical alliance. Calpurnia is useful for her connections to Tevinter blood mages and her experience with the Blight. Her interactions with all these characters is at first defined by her prejudices and maladaptive coping mechanisms (distrust anyone different or who doesn’t see my potential). Her exposure to each individual will slowly dissolve her prejudices and guarded affect, and she’ll start to realize all the ways Tevinter culture has encouraged her to hate and separate herself from others. 
4. **Harding Revisions** 
   1. **What needs to change:** Very little from a character perspective. Harding managed to remain a likeable heart of the party, and I think this quality will come even further to the forefront as she remains one of the more diplomatic party members. What needed to improve was the Titan arc, which required more nuance and conflict and breathing time. 
   2. **Character changes:** Again, little is altered, only that she is given more material to “react” to as her arc continues to center on her discoveries of the true history of the dwarves and titans. It is noteworthy that she is now going to be one of the more optimistic and “upbeat” characters in the party after having made the other changes.
   3. **Regional Changes:** Most of the change happens in Harding's companion quests to better flesh out and complicate Dwarven history. In fact, early encounters with Kal-Sharok dwarves subtly establish that something is *off*: They move with eerie coordination and show minimal emotional expression. Craftsmanship lacks artistry and the ornate aesthetics of Orzammar dwarves or other pre-blight thaigs. Tools are functional, not expressive. Children do not play, but instead perform age-appropriate labor as if instinctively assigned roles. In Act One it remains a large mystery how Kal-Sharok managed to survive the blight alone. Later in Act II Harding’s personal quest leads to a long-abandoned Titan Thaig. The architecture is organic rather than decorative—curving, biological, and alive-feeling rather than angelic or ornate. Evidence of intense conflict is found, but all weapons involved are dwarven, not elven. The Thaig feels less like a ruin and more like the corpse of a living thing. In Act III the full truth is revealed. When the Evanuris killed several Titans to colonize the surface, the dwarves bound to those Titans were *freed* becoming sentient, independent beings for the first time. Crucially, the remaining Titans were not destroyed or tranquilized by the Evanuris. Instead, newly sentient dwarves later invaded the surviving Titans, killing them to “liberate” the dwarves still bound within. This act was driven by: a desire to overthrow their former “rulers” and perhaps even to prevent future enslavement, the desire for power and territory and the exploitation of lyrium as a trade resource for the elven empire. Orzammar deliberately erased this truth from its collective memory to hide its genocide but to protect dwarven egos - the truth they were all just essentially titan antibodies is too devastating to admit. Kal-Sharok, by contrast, made a different choice: they rejoined a surviving Titan hive mind to endure isolation and survive the Blight, sacrificing individuality for survival. Harding’s arc reframes dwarven history as morally compromised rather than purely victimized. She must confront the idea that her people’s freedom came at the cost of genocide and that independence itself was born from violence.Internally, Harding struggles with whether communal survival or individual autonomy is truly the greater good. This revision restores one of Dragon Age’s core strengths: uncovering buried historical atrocities that complicate modern identities. Harding’s story becomes less about discovery for its own sake and more about reckoning—placing dwarves alongside elves, humans, and mages as participants in Thedas’s cycle of power, guilt, and survival.
   4. **Conflict:** Harding is the emotional glue of the group and intentionally strives towards empathy. Other characters may mistrust her due to her budding magical abilities, or her past with the inquisition. However, her charms are ultimately difficult to resist. As she discovers the role ancient elves played in killing the first titans this will result in some conflict, but as the truth becomes more evident this will expand. As Harding rarely introduces conflict into the equation, we see her instead mending fences with other characters or checking in on them, trying to inspire empathy between characters who are less flattering or insulting. 
5. **Lucanis Revisions**
   1. **What needs to change:** Little needed to be changed, but I will make some changes that are cascading from other decisions. Mainly Lucanis’s primary faults lie in the whitewashing of the crows. We need a deeper appreciation for their complicated morality. Lucanis has a lot of potential as a character raised in such circumstances, even as a privileged part of an established crow family. His personality needs to be much darker and complicated than coffee, and I think they over-relied on the novelty of Spite without truly exploring that character either. 
   2. **Character Changes:** My Lucanis is never bonded with a spirit. In the short stories there are hints that Lucanis has a sensitivity to magic - his eyes itch when he is near blood magic. I think he’d be more interesting as a latent mage - one whose powers were subtle and never truly manifested. He is still tortured by Tevinter mages and experimented on - brining some of his latent magical talents to the forefront. He hates this, as he finds magic suspect, and so we have a character who is more plagued by self-hatred. Lucanis is more mercantile, in his mind the transaction of a hit is moral, because anyone who desires to pay the crows their fee must have a good reason to need justice outside the law. 
   3. **Regional changes:** Antiva is no longer one of the cities we have to decide to save or destroy. Its larger geo-political use is both as a staging ground for the Qunari Antaam invasion as well as its potential for the Antivan Merchant Princes to pair with the Rivain Felicisima Armada to fight off naval supremacy of the Qunari in the region. The Merchant Princes potentially supply whichever faction you support in the Act I Minrathous vs. Par Vollen choice. The crows are depicted with significantly more moral ambiguity. We see how they train slaves and children to become killers, and that their morality is more transactional. We also see how they employ assassinations for less powerful individuals when it serves their political needs, or whims. Not all of these are morally ambiguous - they might accept a low fee for a hit on a trafficker for example, or an abusive pimp or rapist. It may not be entirely altruistic, as these occasional acts of “benevolence” are also PR opportunities to maintain their power and anonymity in Antivan culture. 
   4. **Conflict:** Lucanis hates his own latent abilities, and is deeply distrustful of all magic users until he starts to come to a better place of acceptance for his own abilities. 
6. **Bellara Revisions**
   1. **What needs to change**: Bellara gets a bad rap as she does have a few moments of gravitas when discussing the loss of her brother. But she is obviously inserted into this narrative to be a quirky manic pixie girl and that just has no place in Dragon Age. She does little to deepen our understanding of modern elves, and her faction inexplicably accepts that the Elven gods are evil. While their discoveries in Arlathan forest might explain this, I don’t think it is sold well in Veilguard. 
   2. **Character Changes:** Initially I thought it would be best to completely scrap Bellara, but then I thought she’d make an excellent bait and switch. During Act I, she appears to be the same quirky manic pixie we meet in Veilguard, but she is hiding a secret. She is herself an ancient elf (explaining her unique tattoos) that previously allied with Solas. When he betrayed Felassan (This ancient elf ally is actually killed in modern times at the end of the Masked Empire), his ancient ally, she defected. She realized he could not be trusted and had no love for modern elves who she had also grown fond of. She still believes her brother was dead, but he did in fact serve a Forgotten One. When she joined the Veil Jumpers she explained away her familiarity with ancient elven technology as genius, and led them to “discoveries” of the true nature of the Evanuris. Later she will reveal herself, and drop her quirky front. Her personal quests will largely be hunting down existing parts of Solas’s elven spy network. It is through this hunt she stumbles upon news that her brother is still alive. Her role in the party will be much like the Promethean companion in Mass Effect, providing interesting commentary on ancient Thedas and early elven, human, qunari and dwarven civilization. These can serve as delicious lore drops. 
   3. **Regional Changes:** Not much is changed when it comes to the Veil Jumpers or Arlathan forest. There’s just better justification for what exists - and Arlathan can still serve as a location where we occasionally track down Solas agents as he attempts to find artifacts and other places where the veil is weak in order to turn the tide with the Evanuris, or destroy the veil altogether. 
   4. **Conflict:** As an ancient elf and mage, there is some conflict with Lucanis and the Tamassran, as well as with Calpurnia. There is brief conflict with Harding as the initial history of the Titans is revealed. This character has an easy friendship with the Nevarran spirit companion and Davrin is fascinated to learn more about early elves. 
7. **Davrin Revisions**
   1. What needs to change: Ok, this one is probably also controversial. I don’t think much. Yeah, Davrin doesn’t stand out, but every group kind of needs an uncontroversial bland bro character who is just there to back up the main character. His character isn’t deeply complicated but his discovery of the griffons and grappling with the responsibility to them gives us plenty of depth. 
   2. **Changes to Character:** Again, I’m not changing much here. Like Harding, Davrin is an important character to provide some glue to this group. Harding is the mom or big sister, and Davrin is the dad friend. Both will remain potential sacrifices in the final act of the game, and so we need them to be less complicated so their deaths are more emotionally resonant. Davrin’s main function in the group is to be utilitarian over sentimental. He is a lieutenant who is able to keep the group together and value their individual strengths, even when their character incompatibilities or shortcomings are glaring. As a Grey Warden, he knows that dealing with challenging personalities is an easy pill to swallow in order to save the world. I would show him consistently looking for logical compromise and diplomacy even in the face of insulting behavior. 
   3. **Region Changes:** Weishaupt remains an incredible set piece that I would not change. I am also a big fan of the gloom howler narrative. My only change would be perhaps a brief appearance by an Awakening ally (Architect or Mother) or some other grey warden characters, maybe a meter to see if we have enough blighted allies to unveil a mystery or way to combat the blight that remains after the endgame. 
   4. **Conflict:** The most difficult personality for Davrin will be Calpurnia as she is an overt racist against elves. Again, he manages to overcome her insults and pettiness for the greater good. Likewise he can be found around the lighthouse talking to other characters about their distaste for other party members, with him always emphasizing their greater utility to the cause, while also acknowledging their right to be upset or untrusting. 
8. **Morrigan Revisions**
   1. **Why the Dark Ritual:** I don't have a ton of revisions for this character but I do think its is a little criminal we didn’t get more lines from her. One thing I do wish we got to see from Morrigan is an exploration of The Dark Ritual. In my revisions to the main plot it is critical to explore spirit fragments and the ability of a single spirit to split into multiple full bodied entities. Before getting into that line of thought I want to explore the reasoning for the ritual to begin with. Why would Mythal wish to preserve a piece of one of the Evanuris? I think this could be really interesting, as they betrayed her but she may still retain a maternal feeling for them. Maybe she also has a deep regret for having corrupted her brethren through convincing them to leave the fade. Maybe the ritual was a way to preserve an untainted fragment of a lost friend or child. If the ritual was performed, Morrigan may also posses a tiny fragment of June (Or whichever Elven God corresponded to the Old God of Beauty). I know the devs have argued that the old god baby is a headache, but this fragment could only make a short appearance without breaking the bank. 
   2. **Was this the first ritual?** Had Mythal been collecting more fragments this whole time? Does she possess any other Evanuris fragments? How would their thoughts and perspectives impact Veilguard? I would like to believe she had. A fragment of Andruil could help us convert Ghilan’an. The fragments of Falon’din and Dirthamen were twins, and could provide additional insight into the major plot twist I had in mind for the end. Possession of these fragments could also help in recruiting the additional Mythal fragment in the crossroads.

Cold sweat clung to his forehead. His heartbeat, frantic seconds earlier, settled back into a steady rhythm. For the first time in a long while, he had dreamed — and the kind of dream he wouldn’t wish on anyone.

The anxiety lingered, coiling in his stomach; even his morning coffee twisted painfully inside him. With a strange mix of urgency and anticipation, he committed to carrying out his plan — calling it an experiment felt almost accurate. There was still a sip of coffee at the bottom of the cup, but he didn’t care.

Tu sat in his pocket, warm and quiet.

He locked the door behind him and checked it twice more before descending the stairs — stairs he knew almost too well. Every chip in the wood, every creak, every soft step and every loud one. He remembered how he used to walk on the intact planks, trying not to wake Louise with the sounds.

The entrance door burst open into sunlight that blinded him for a moment. Warm, pleasant wind brushed against his face. He paused, taking in the quiet beauty of the day. Removing his grief from the equation, the town truly was beautiful. People were friendly, endlessly friendly — and yet there was no life in them. They were shells, empty but smiling, incapable of feeling anything that wasn’t joy.

Noon was close. The sky was spotless, glowing in shades of blue. And far on the horizon floated white clouds — fluffy, unreachable, like candy dissolving into various shapes and figures.

His thoughts drifted among them, threading the clouds together with some invisible string. It frightened him, this realization: that all he’d done here was work and be happy. Every day identical to the last. No laziness, no sorrow. Too perfect. Too still. Too wrong.

Stop by the bakery on the corner — the one that always smelled like fresh pastry?

He couldn’t remember what weighed so heavily on his soul. A feeling of unfinished obligation — but what exactly had he meant to do? Crossing the street slowly, stepping between the stone tiles and avoiding the lines between them, he searched his memory for something that wouldn’t return.

Rounding the corner, he saw the glass storefront with the sign:
“Charlie’s Bakery.”

The owner greeted him with a smile. They’d known each other for a couple of weeks — enough to chat, enough to feel familiar. Charlie adored French pastries; the counter was always lined with soft, airy croissants. He slipped one into a paper bag and waited for payment.

Jacob reached into his pocket — and felt the textured surface of a folded note.

He pulled a few folded bills from his pocket and handed them to Charlie. Dropping into a small table near the counter, he bit into the croissant and began unfolding the note, folded five times. His eyes ran across the text, his brows tightened, and Jake’s expression changed. Thanking Charlie for the pastry, he walked out—with a purpose no one around him could see.

He headed toward the railway station, where red-and-white trains arrived throughout the day.

As he reached the entrance, the iron hinges holding the old oak door gave a long creak. Inside, the station was empty. A few benches stood in the center for waiting passengers, along with a restroom, the boarding door, and a ticket booth. Laying the money on the counter, he turned his hand palm-up toward the clerk, waiting for the small red ticket to the next departing train.

On the tiny slip—barely the length of two finger segments—was the departure time: 14:55. Standing and waiting, Jake tapped his foot against the stone floor, rolling the crumpled note between his fingers.

1q6rz1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q6rz1i/aitah_for_snapping_at_my_friend_and_telling_him/,AITAH for snapping at my friend and telling him he's turning into an incel fueled by toxic masculinity?,"**TL;DR:** My male friend has repeatedly ignored our advice after bad dating experiences. I believe he's fallen into a victim mentality and started blaming women as a whole while consuming “alpha male” incel type content. At a group coffee outing, he said dating is 'war' and men must 'dominate on the battlefield to please women' to his online date which crossed a line for me. I snapped, called him out for toxic behavior, and said this mindset is why he keeps ending up a miserable incel. Now some friends want me to apologize to keep the peace, others think it was overdue, and I’m asking if I was the asshole for being blunt.

**Post:** Hey all,

I (24M) have a friend (23M) who’s grown very resentful against women. He’s been taken advantage of multiple times by women he’s dated or by women he's been interested in. Sometimes financially, sometimes emotionally, sometimes just used for attention or validation. But every time it happens, we give him advice on how to avoid the same situations, and every time he ignores it and walks straight into the same pothole again.

Instead of learning from it, he’s leaned hard into victim mentality. He talks constantly about how women 'don’t respect men like they used to,' how dating is rigged against guys, and how men are expected to just suck it up no matter what. What started as venting slowly turned into him blaming women as a whole for his own repeated bad decisions. It got to a point where we recommended he consider a therapist but he always says he doesn't feel like paying someone to listen to him vent (even though he can very well afford it). And it's gotten pretty tiring to hear the same things over and over when because tell him what to do differently to avoid being hurt but he never listens. We recommended he sees professional help because most of us don't have the qualifications to deal with his increasing negative outlook.

Our friend group used to side with him a lot and keep trying to give him advice. We legitimately felt bad because some of what he went through was genuinely hurtful. But over time, his worldview has gotten really toxic because of his bad experiences with women (more below in the additional info section). He frames everything through this lens of being wronged, even when red flags are obvious and avoidable. It's gotten to a point where he 's starting to go down the rabbit hole of watching Andrew Tate, Jordan Peterson political views, and 'Alpha Male' podcasts.

We’ve talked privately about distancing ourselves in our friend group, but there was never a specific moment to tip the scales until now.

We went to grab coffee at a coffee shop with the rest of our friend group. While we were finishing our drinks, he started telling a story about how he matched with a girl on a dating app the other day who was a bit offput by how expensive their first date is. When she kept insisting they go somewhere cheaper, he tried explaining to her that 'Dating is a form of war where men must dominate the battlefield to succeed.' And 'if she doesn't understand that, then he's not interested in dating her.'

I WISH I was joking. I'm paraphrasing here, but that's more or less what he said in our conversation.

I told him that if he’s going to be a hateful dick by projecting his dating issues onto women, then he’s embarrassing himself as a man, and I called him an incel. I also said that constantly blaming women instead of reflecting on his own choices was exactly why he keeps ending up miserable.

The table went dead silent after that.

When the check came, everyone paid and left, but he drove himself home. On the drive back, some of my guy friends said I went too far and was a dick and should apologize for how harsh I was. The 2 girls that were with us thanked me for standing up for them and didn't agree with me apologizing and that he needed tough love. Most just said it was uncomfortable but overdue.

Now I’m getting pressure from the guys to apologize and 'keep the peace' and lose a close friend we've known sine undergrade whereas the girls think I'm babying a grown man who can make his own decisions. I honestly don’t think I was wrong, but I was blunt.

AITAH?

**Some additional info if you have time more time:** I left a lot out because the post would’ve been way too long, but there’s important background.

Multiple friends, including myself, have encouraged him to see a therapist. We genuinely don’t think he’s in a healthy headspace. We recommended that once we realized most of us aren't cut out to help him with the stuff he's been spewing. He's always just shrugged it off and refuses to because he doesn't feel like paying money for something like that.

About two years ago, his ex cheated on him multiple times. After the second time, I told him flat out he needed to cut contact and get professional help. He didn’t. Everyone in the group knows this woman is a horrible person, he does too, but he still wanted to see her for SOME reason.

At one point, that same girlfriend invited him to a party with her friends. We all warned him not to go and said it would end badly but he went anyway. The next morning, he texted saying he got blackout drunk, woke up on someone’s couch with no idea how he got there, and realized his wallet and expensive watch were missing. Nothing violent happened thank god, but the situation was still alarming. Three months later, he wanted to get back together with the girlfriend who indirectly caused this. But this is where he began his rant on how women only care about money and sex after one of them stole the wallet and watch.

Another issue is the online crowd he spends time with. One woman he met through gaming pressured him into buying her video games, cosmetics, and in game currency. He gave in so many times and when we finally told him to speak to her about their 'friendship', she ghosted him immediately afterward. He was devastated and spiraled and said he felt used and disposable and how men are only used as an emotional crutch and taken advantage of for when women want things.

We tried explaining he needs to hang out more with his real life friends who actually appreciate him but he never listened. Which is how we wound up to where we are today.

That's the fuller picture. Those are the worst events to happen in somewhat recent memory that caused him to go down the toxic masculinity path.",0,1767820638.0,AITAH,2,0.33,False

Has anyone gone to a course (I'm looking at a local midwife led one rather than NCT again) for subsequent pregnancies? I'm worried it will be lonely mat leave without a few local people in the same boat. And it would be useful to learn more information around birth.

1q6rw39,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6rw39,Sabayon - 2025 New Years Eve special menu review,"After the fucking dilemma I went through to get a reservation to [Sabayon](https://sabayon.ca/) for their New Year's Eve special menu and my ex disappearing on me, I managed to find someone to take on this experience so here's my mini review :)

To recap, it was $760 CAD for two seats (Tax + tips included). This was for the 7-course menu (They usually serve a 5-course menu), with Amuse-bouche and Mignardises as well as the wine accords.

Venue is lovely, open space with bar stools in the first room with a full kitchen view and then the micro-dining room area which I believe fits maybe 14 or 16 people in total. One bathroom and a type of walk-in closet used for their tea cups for their high-tea experience

Sabayon is a duo of *Chef Patrice Demers* and everything else being handled by *Marie-Josée Beaudoin* who is also the sommelier

We were seated and were served our glass of champagne while awaiting the Amuse-bouche. Pretty standard champagne for the occasion of creating ""new year, new me"" resolutions. We ended up getting served another glass of champagne and then we began!

**Amuse-bouche:**  
Chicken liver mousse tartlet, with some black currant jam accompanied with a mushroom broth to warm us up on that fantastically cold winter evening. The mushrooms themselves actually smelled like Maple syrup? Yet had nothing to do with the flavour profile which was more earthy.

**Course 1: Caviar Acadian Gold**

These tiny crackers were stuffed with smoked sturgeon and topped with Acadian Gold caviar which has such a wonderful taste to it. It is less fishy, less salty yet more rich. Texture too is different from regular larger caviar. Apparently only 20% of Sturgeon produce this kind of caviar but what do I know lol

**Course 2: Scallops from Nova Scotia**

Fresh, citrusy with the clementine, vibrant with a hint of spiciness from the radish. Scallops dissolved in my mouth. Edible marigold flower petals too (does not add to the flavour but elevates the prettiness)

**Course 3: Arctic Char**  
The fish itself was cooked over a long period of time, my fork glided and it practically got sliced like room temperature butter. So soft. So smooth. The sabayon was of a Japanese tea, so it added some sweetness and bitterness. The honeynut squash puree elevated the sweetness and I believe the base was a type of spinach perhaps? That just tied it all together

**Course 4: Lamb from Kamouraska**

Each component served its purpose but GODDAMN the lamb jus was incredible. The lamb was stuffed inside of the cabbage, cooked with simple salt and pepper, probably some butter but no actual spices. The jus is what brought it to life. Parsley root puree was classic with beet root and haskap berry which just tasted like a blackberry to me

**Course 5: Louis d'Or Cheese**

Honey toasted brioche sprinkled with salt paired with grated Louis d'Or cheese, followed by a layer of Louis d'Or Cream Cheese and at the bottom of the bowl we had a compote of quince which was sour yet blended so perfectly to the cheesiness

**Course 6: Carrot and Sea Buckthorn Granita**

Super tasty and refreshing dessert. Which was much colder than I anticipated. The cream was silky smooth with the sweetened carrots and roasted pumpkin seeds.

**Course 7: Chocolate and Coffee Mousse**

Triple layer dessert. Top was dark chocolate mousse with pecans. The middle layer was a pecan cake. The bottom layer was a cardamom ice cream. It was absolutely divine, I wish I could have had another!

**Mignardises:**  
Home made ice cream dipped in milk chocolate with a Quebec berry or cherry at the top. And a buckwheat financier, which wrapped it all beautifully paired with a double espresso

All in all, fantastic! Overpriced for the novelty of the New Year's Eve. I will most definitely try my best to get to experience their high-tea and eventually maybe another tasting course :D

So here it is: just read it. Go in blind. READ IT. Preferably in a dark garage, in one sitting, with a huge pot of black coffee. But to each their own.

Over the years, my taste in books has been—let’s say—borderline bipolar. I can read a nonfiction physics book one week and a king book the next. But in all my twenty years of living, this particular book hits every mark for me: perfect storytelling, relentless suspense, deeply fleshed-out characters, and just a rock-solid, wildly entertaining read. I would recommend it to literally anyone—except my cat, who is extremely sensitive to loud machines, especially vacuum cleaners.

Honestly, without a doubt, I’d put it up there as one of King’s best works(said this haveing read IT and The Stand)

I don’t even know if the intended audience was teens, tweens, or adults, but I found it insanely relatable despite how unique the characters are. They all go through so much growth, and even though I’m about as un-American as it gets (some Maine expressions flew right over my head—thank God for Reddit), I connected to it deeply. I cried for the characters, laughed with them, and felt completely pulled into their world.

1q6rspa,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q6rspa/how_i_stopped_getting_distracted_by_everything_to/,How I stopped getting distracted by everything to being able to focus for 5 hours straight,"A few months ago I noticed something kinda messed up. I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

What methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!

1q6ropq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q6ropq/i_see_you/,I see you.,"It started on a Monday. That detail matters because Mondays already feel cursed, and this one leaned into it.

I was alone in my apartment, rain tapping against the windows in that irritating, too‑rhythmic way. My phone buzzed on the table. Unknown number.

I see you.

Three words. No punctuation. No emoji. Just confidence.

I assumed it was a prank. Someone bored. Someone stupid. I didn’t reply. I muted the phone and went back to pretending I had control over my life.

An hour later, the phone buzzed again.

I see you.

Same message. Same spacing. Same time interval.

That’s when I noticed something else. The mirror in my bathroom wasn’t angled the way I left it. I remember because I obsessively straighten things. It was tilted slightly to the left now, just enough to be wrong.

I adjusted it and told myself to calm down. People don’t get haunted because of text messages. That’s not how reality works. Or at least that’s what I thought then.

The messages continued. Every hour. No matter where I was. At work. On the train. At 3:00 a.m. when my phone should have been silent.

I see you.

I tried blocking the number. It didn’t help. I tried turning the phone off. When I turned it back on, the message was already there, waiting like it had been watching the whole time.

Then the sounds started.

Scratching. Inside the walls. Slow and deliberate, like fingernails tracing lines just to feel the texture. It never happened during the day. Only at night. Only when I was alone.

I stopped sleeping.

On the fourth night, the message changed.

Look in the mirror.

My stomach dropped. I stood in the hallway staring at the bathroom door like it might open on its own. I didn’t want to look. Every instinct I had was screaming not to.

I looked anyway.

At first, I saw myself. Pale. Dark circles under my eyes. Hands shaking. Then the reflection lagged. Just a fraction of a second. Enough to notice.

Something moved behind me in the mirror.

I spun around. Nothing there.

When I turned back, the reflection was smiling. I wasn’t.

The smile was wrong. Too wide. Too patient.

A whisper brushed my ear.

“I’m already here.”

I stumbled backward, hit the wall, dropped the phone. When I picked it up, there was another message.

Tomorrow.

That’s all it said.

The next day, people stopped reacting to me properly. I spoke to a coworker, and she stared through me like I was a smudge on glass. A barista handed me coffee without meeting my eyes, like she was afraid she’d see something she shouldn’t.

Mirrors got worse.

Every reflective surface showed a slightly different version of me. One blinked too slowly. One had no pupils. One didn’t move at all.

At night, the scratching became footsteps.

Slow. Bare. Wet.

I locked my bedroom door. It didn’t matter. I could hear breathing on the other side. Calm breathing. Familiar breathing.

My own.

The final message arrived at 2:17 a.m.

It’s your turn.

The mirror in my room cracked down the center without a sound. From the other side, something pressed its face against the glass. No eyes. No mouth. Just smooth skin stretched too tight, like it was wearing me as a template.

I understood then. It didn’t want to kill me.

It wanted to replace me.

I don’t know how long I fought it. Time stopped behaving normally. When I finally looked into the mirror again, I was on the other side.

Watching.

Now I send the messages. Always the same three words. Always true.

I see you.

And if your reflection ever hesitates before copying your movements, don’t panic.

It’s just making sure it gets you right.",2,1767820004.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I've always hated how traditional ad networks treat small creators. You either get rejected by AdSense for ""low traffic,"", ""rubbish content"" (in very polite way) or you get approved and earn $0.05/month while ruining your site's design with intrusive banners and strugling ad blockers while using adblocker for yourself.

So I built **CheerAd**.

It’s a simple ""Community Spotlight"" widget. Instead of programmatic ads, your visitors/fans can pay (via Stripe) to feature their own message or project on your site instantly.

**How it works:**

1. You embed a small JS snippet.
2. A visitor pays $5 (or whatever you set).
3. They get the spotlight on your site. You get paid directly.

It’s like ""Buy Me A Coffee"" but the supporter gets actual visibility in return.

I'm looking for feedback on the UX and the ""empty state"" design. 

Would you use this on your personal blog/project?

## T+07:58:30 (Pulse 319)  
**Particle Physics Lab, University Office**

Elias stood up.

He didn’t remember deciding to. His body just did it, like it had grown tired of being a witness in a chair.

His legs felt numb at first, pins and needles blooming in the calves, the faint sway of blood returning like a delayed verdict. The room around him was a paper storm that had settled into drifts: printouts sliding off the desk, equations crawling across margins, timing diagrams and spectra layered like sediment. His laptop fan whined steadily, a small, exhausted animal trapped in plastic.

His phone lay face up now—no more posturing. No more pretending that turning it over could keep the universe from buzzing.

The screen in front of him showed the count with the kind of bland typography humans used for harmless things.

**Pulse 319.**

One more after this.

One more tick.

He stared at the number and thought, absurdly, of every time he’d been wrong in safe ways.

Wrong in seminar rooms, where the penalty was an embarrassed laugh and a revised slide. Wrong on exams where red ink felt like weather you could walk out of. Wrong in arguments that ended with beer and someone saying, *Well, we learned something.*

Safe wrongness.

He had built his life around the assumption that being right was a quiet reward. A personal satisfaction. A line in a paper. A citation.

He had never wondered what it felt like to be right in a way that didn’t fit in a journal.

Right in a way that reached outside the lab.

Right in a way that could break the world simply by existing.

On the conference line, voices had thinned over the last hour. The call had stopped being a conversation and had become a shared vigil, a rope held by too many hands. Elias could hear the texture of people now more than their words.

DeShawn’s breathing, measured and stubborn, the breath of someone who kept the room standing by refusing to collapse.

Mara’s silence, dense and listening, the silence of a mind that had crossed from analysis into acceptance and found the ground didn’t feel solid anymore.

A faint rustle of paper somewhere. A chair squeaks. A mic was muted and unmuted again, as if someone kept starting to speak and then deciding speech was a sin.

In the background of it all, the professionals’ chaos: the small sounds of people trying not to become a mob, trying not to turn anger into noise, trying not to beg.

Elias watched the plots update. The peak was still razor-thin. The phase is still locked—the mode still cleaner than it had any right to be.

Over-control, right up to the edge.

His mouth went dry. He swallowed and felt nothing move.

He didn’t want to say the thing forming in his mind. He hated it. It sounded like cruelty. It sounded like a taunt.

But it wasn’t cruelty.

It was physics.

He whispered into the headset, voice so quiet it almost didn’t count as speech.

“If it happens,” he said, “it already happened eight minutes ago.”

A solar physicist snapped immediately, not loud but sharp with the reflexive anger of a person protecting themselves from the idea. “Don’t.”

Elias winced. Not because he felt guilty, but because he understood why the word hurt.

Eight minutes.

Light-time.

Delay.

The universe’s oldest joke: the curtain falls before you see it fall, and you spend your last moments watching an image of a thing that no longer exists.

Elias didn’t mean it as a prophecy. He meant it as a reminder of the cruelty built into observation. The fact that made “real time” an illusion and made helplessness feel procedural.

Pulse 319 rolled toward completion.

On his laptop, the pulse counter ticked down with clinical politeness. On the line, someone’s breathing hitched and then steadied. Somewhere else, someone was whispering a checklist into the void.

Elias stood with his hands flat on the desk, feeling the paper edges bite his palms, grounding himself in the only real texture he had.

The plots have been updated.

Pulse 319 ended.

And the line went quiet, not the empty quiet of a dropped call, but the heavy, saturated quiet of a room full of people holding their breath so hard there was no space left for sound.

## T+08:00:00 (Pulse 320)  
**DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory**

The Sun breathed.

Pulse 320 arrived right on time, clean as a blade sliding into a sheath.

For a fraction of a second, everything was familiar in the way nightmares become familiar when they’ve lasted long enough to feel like weather. The disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun’s face, a synchronized inhale. The brightness proxies lifted by a hair. The helioseismic mode landed exactly where it had landed 219 times before.

Perfect.

Obscene.

Certain.

Mara felt the room lean into it without anyone moving, a collective flinch toward the tick as if the human species had become one animal listening for a footstep.

And then the spike disappeared.

Not decayed.

Not smeared.

Not broadened into noise.

Gone.

The power spectrum refreshed, and the line that had been a razor was simply… absent, as if it had never existed. The noise floor returned like static rushing into a vacuum. The cathedral of modes reappeared as a messy choir, but the conductor’s baton was missing. There was no dominant peak. No polite ninety-second knock.

Just physics resuming its ordinary sloppiness in a space where something had been holding it too tight.

On the wall, the image feed hiccuped.

A slight stutter in the stream, the way a camera feed stutters when it is suddenly asked to interpret a scene that no longer matches its assumptions. Auto-exposure hunted, gain rising and falling in a frantic, blind search for a target that wasn’t there. Filters adjusted out of habit, shutters cycling for a Sun that had stopped giving them anything to shutter against.

Protection routines fired anyway, dutiful as trained dogs, and found nothing to protect against.

The Sun’s disk was no longer there to be filtered, softened, and translated into a set of safe colors—no bright limb. No granulation. No mottled, boiling quilt of convection.

Just a hole in the data where the most significant signal in the solar system had been.

And on the wall display, where a disk of impossible brightness had owned the room for Mara’s entire career, there was now an empty region of sky.

Not black. The instruments still had a background. Stray light. Calibration ghosts. The faint clutter of a universe that was never truly quiet.

But the Sun, the anchor, the bully, the nearest star they had built their entire understanding around, was simply absent.

A few people made sounds that weren’t words. Tiny exhalations that failed to become speech. The start of a laugh that died in the throat. A half-gasp was swallowed immediately, as if making noise might break whatever was happening next.

Jun’s pencil slipped from his fingers.

It hit the floor and made a small, ridiculous click.

The sound felt indecently loud. It felt like a joke told at a funeral. It cut through the room’s stunned silence with a physicality that made Mara’s skin prickle.

Alarms tried to start and then tripped over their own logic. Warning banners flashed, then changed, then vanished as automation revised itself in real time: target lost, signal drop, tracking failure, instrument safe.

Words that belonged to a telescope that had lost lock.

Words that did not belong to the Sun.

Mara heard her own voice before she realized she was speaking. It came out thin and almost calm, because shock sometimes wore the costume of composure.

“It’s gone.”

Someone behind her made a strangled noise and then forced it into language. “No,” they said. “No, it can’t be.”

Mara did not turn. She couldn’t. Turning would imply there was something else worth looking at.

Her eyes stayed on nothing.

On her second monitor, time stamps rolled forward. Data packets kept arriving. The system was still alive. The observatory was still taking measurements of… absence. The software kept trying to interpret the space where a star had been, and failing in small, honest ways.

Mara’s mind reached for the one piece of cruelty it could still hold onto as structure.

Eight minutes.

The thought was no longer a theory. It was a clock in her bones.

Eight minutes between here and everywhere else.

Eight minutes until Earth sees what she is seeing.

Eight minutes until the light from the last Sun that ever belonged to humanity finishes crossing the gulf, and the sky changes for everyone.

She stared at the blank region of data and felt a shallow, involuntary hope flicker anyway, sick and human and impossible.

Maybe it will pulse one more time.

Maybe the lock will release, and it will come back like a held breath finally exhaled.

Maybe.

The next ninety seconds began.

And in the room, for the first time all day, the metronome did not knock.

There was only stillness, so complete it felt like the universe had leaned in close.

Mara tasted copper in her mouth and realized she had bitten her tongue.

Eight minutes, she thought again, and this time the thought came with a physical awareness of consequence.

Eight minutes until the world notices with its skin.

## T+08:00:00  
**SWPC, Boulder**

The Sun’s plots didn’t fade.

They dropped.

Cleanly. Clinically. Like a heart monitor deciding, without drama, that the patient was no longer participating.

On the big screen, numbers that had been noisy and alive for hours went to baseline as if somebody had unplugged the universe.

GOES X-ray flux: flat.

EUV proxies: flat.

Proton monitors: suddenly unmoored, the live feeds still streaming but no longer anchored to the steady, familiar upstream source they were built around.

Every channel that had been held up by that bright, violent constant outside their windows became a blank that the software tried to label with polite error messages.

DATA GAP  
SIGNAL LOSS  
SOURCE NOT DETECTED

The room didn’t erupt.

It froze.

Not the theatrical freeze of a movie where everyone gasps in unison. The real freeze, the kind that happens when the brain refuses to spend calories on disbelief because disbelief has become too expensive. People went still at their stations, hands hovering over keyboards. A headset mic squealed faintly as someone clenched their jaw and shifted.

DeShawn stared at the wall of plots like his eyes could force the Sun back into the numbers.

For a second, he instinctively reached for the catalog of mundane explanations, the list every ops person kept like a rosary: pipeline failure, timing chain, satellite downlink, processing outage.

But the flatlines were everywhere at once. Independent instruments. Independent clocks. Independent agencies. The whole network agreed.

Agreement was what killed denial.

Someone, nobody ever remembered who, peeled a fluorescent sticky note off a pad and slapped it to the edge of a monitor.

**P320 = ZERO**

It was not a ceremony. It was survival—a label you could say out loud without choking.

Liz looked up at DeShawn, eyes wide but dry. Nobody had time for tears yet. Tears required permission.

A few people began talking at once, reflexive operational chatter trying to reassert order.

“Check redundancy…”  
“Cross-confirm with NOAA feeds…”  
“Do we have SDO…”  
“Is this a telemetry…”

DeShawn lifted one hand without looking away from the screen. It wasn’t a command so much as a request for silence.

They went quiet anyway. Not because he was in charge. Because the data had said something louder than any human voice.

On the conference line, Elias exhaled once.

It might have been triumph in another universe, a different timeline where being right was a victory.

Here, it was just grief wearing a different face. The sound of a man who had carried a number up a mountain and reached the top, only to discover the view was worse than he feared.

He said, very quietly, “Pulse three-twenty.”

No one answered him.

No one needed to.

The word *pulse* had stopped being a metaphor and become a timestamp on a death certificate.

DeShawn’s eyes slid to the windows.

Outside, the sky over Boulder was still bright. Blue and ordinary. The foothills sat in their familiar winter posture. Cars moved along the road like nothing had happened. Light lay on the world with the casual generosity it had always had.

The Sun was still shining.

That was the cruelty that made people angry, the particular insult of the universe’s speed limit. You could lose the most important thing in your sky and still have time to finish your coffee before your eyes get the memo.

DeShawn felt a sour flare of anger rise in his chest and then collapse into something heavier. Grief, maybe. Or the pre-grief of a man watching a guillotine fall in slow motion.

He looked at the wall clock.

The second hand swept like it had no idea what it was counting down.

Eight minutes.

Not until darkness. Not yet.

Eight minutes until the lie of daylight ended.

Eight minutes until everyone, everywhere, stopped arguing about graphs and conspiracy and jokes and finally learned the truth, the oldest way humans learned anything:

By looking up.

DeShawn swallowed and tasted metal. He realized he’d been clenching his teeth for hours.

He spoke, not into the conference call this time, but into the room. His voice came out steady because steadiness was what he had left to give.

“Mark the time,” he said. “All systems. All channels. Pulse three-twenty. This is our zero.”

Somebody’s fingers moved. A keyboard clicked. The sound was absurdly normal.

Outside, sunlight still poured through the glass.

Inside, the Sun was already gone.

⸻

## T+08:06:00 (Pulse 320 + 4 minutes)  
**VESPER Mission Operations, Night Shift Room**

They had written **PULSE 320** on the whiteboard in dry-erase, twice, as if repetition could turn dread into procedure.

Under it, someone had added a smaller note in a different hand:

**Sunlight is a delay.**

Rina Torres sat with her headset on and a hand wrapped around a cold paper cup, not drinking, just anchoring herself to something that still had weight. The room still smelled like warm plastic and stale caffeine, but the air had gone sharp with that peculiar electronics scent you got when a system was being forced to do too much.

Somewhere along the way, they had stopped saying “T plus,” as if it meant control. Now it was just Pulse 320 and what came after, as if naming the cliff edge could make it smaller.

On the main display, the downlink window waited with the patient, indifferent posture of machines: **LOCK PENDING.**

They had been trying to reacquire VESPER for four minutes. Four minutes since the predicted Venus encounter time. Four minutes since the moment the plasma front should have arrived, if the propagation fit was right and if the Sun’s new discipline hadn’t invented a fresh way to be cruel.

A soft chime.

The lock indicator flipped.

**CARRIER ACQUIRED**

Rina didn’t exhale. She didn’t trust her lungs anymore.

“Pull it,” her teammate said, voice dry as paper.

Packets began to pour in. The screen filled with timestamps that were both relief and insult. Proof that the spacecraft had been alive long enough to speak. Proof that everything they were about to learn had already happened.

The first plots looked like panic drawn by a machine that didn’t believe in panic.

Magnetotail compression: off-scale.  
Ionospheric density proxy: spiking, then clipping.  
Ultraviolet nightside airglow: saturated into sheets, the planet’s dark hemisphere lit like someone had peeled the skin off its atmosphere and held it up to a lamp.

Then the particle instruments hit their hard limits and stayed there.

“Jesus,” her teammate muttered, and it came out like a reflex, not a prayer.

Rina’s eyes moved the way training demanded: not the pretty channels, not the planetary feeds, but the spacecraft’s own body. The stuff that told you whether your instrument was a witness or a corpse.

**BUS VOLTAGE:** jittering, then sagging.  
**SOLAR ARRAY CURRENT:** climbing in ugly steps, the signature of charging and discharge.  
**RAD MONITOR:** pegged, then went blank in a way that did not mean safe. It meant overwhelmed.

A line of text scrolled by in calm, uppercase profanity:

**SEU RATE EXCEEDS THRESHOLD**

Single-event upsets—the polite term for cosmic bullets punching holes through logic.

Then:

**STAR TRACKER: LOST IN VIEW**  
**REACTION WHEELS: TORQUE SATURATION**  
**ATTITUDE ERROR: GROWING**

“Come on,” Rina whispered, not to the spacecraft exactly, but to the universe as if encouragement could help a machine hold itself together. At the same time, an atmosphere-sized hammer hit the planet beneath it.

The next packet arrived with the bluntness of an injury report.

**HGA POINTING: OFF-AXIS**  
**LINK MARGIN: CRITICAL**

The high-gain antenna had begun to slip. VESPER was tumbling, not wildly yet, but enough that the beam was wandering off Earth. Sufficient that the downlink was becoming a stutter.

The planetary feed was updated one more time before the pointing drift stole it.

Venus’ nightside wasn’t just glowing anymore. It looked bruised from orbit, broad bands of emission crawling outward from the limb, chemistry and plasma forced into a pattern by a driver that did not care what Venus wanted. The induced magnetosphere was no longer a borrowed umbrella.

It was a fist being clenched and unclenched around the planet.

Rina caught herself doing the thing humans did when reality went hostile: she checked the clock, like time owed her a different answer.

**08:06.**

Two minutes until Earth’s eyes got the memo.

Behind her, a monitor chimed. Not the downlink. A system alert from a different screen, almost comically mundane.

**NEWS: “UNUSUAL SOLAR ANOMALY UNDER INVESTIGATION.”**

The words looked like they’d been written by someone who still believed vocabulary could restrain physics.

VESPER didn’t.

A new banner flashed on the spacecraft health panel:

**AUTO SAFE MODE INITIATED.**

For a heartbeat, hope rose anyway, sick and automatic. Safe mode meant the spacecraft still had a self. Still had enough coherence to decide to survive.

Then the next packet hit.

**SAFE MODE FAILED: ATTITUDE NOT STABILIZED.**

And beneath it, like an afterthought delivered by a cold god of diagnostics:

**WATCHDOG RESET.**

A watchdog timer. The last line of defense against a computer that had stopped making sense.

It reset again.

And again.

Each reset bought them a few seconds of telemetry, each one uglier than the last. Power dipping. Current spikes. Sensors are dropping out like nerves going numb—a brief return of the carrier, then a slip, then a harsher slip.

Rina leaned closer to the screen until she could see the pixel edges, as if proximity could force the data to confess a kinder ending.

“Rina,” her teammate said, and she could hear the strain under the flatness now. “Look at the timestamp. This is…”

He didn’t finish. He didn’t have to.

The packet times were Venus-time, then Earth-received time. The gap was the distance, the four-minute confession delay. Everything VESPER was saying to them was already history. The spacecraft was speaking from inside a past that could not be altered, only witnessed.

The downlink dropped for half a second, came back as a whisper, and delivered one last, small brutality.

**THERMAL LIMIT EXCEEDED: AVIONICS BAY**  
**POWER BUS: UNDERVOLT**  
**CARRIER: UNSTABLE**

Then the line went dead in the cleanest way possible.

**CARRIER LOST**

No fade. No graceful sign-off. Just absence, like a mouth closing mid-sentence.

The room stayed quiet except for the hiss of headsets and the low hum of machines that didn’t understand grief.

Rina tried the procedures anyway because the procedure was what humans did when their hearts weren’t ready to admit the truth.

Reacquire.  
Ping.  
Wait.  
Reacquire again.

Nothing.

On the screen, the lock indicator remained a calm, indifferent gray.

**NO SIGNAL**

Her teammate slowly pulled his headset off, as if it weighed too much. He looked at her, eyes reflecting the monitors’ pale light.

“It’s gone,” he said, and the words landed with a strange echo because they’d been said today about a star.

Rina’s mouth went dry. She reached for her cup and realized her hand was shaking.

In the corner of the room, a window with blinds let in ordinary light. Bright. Wrongly cheerful. The world outside was still daytime. People were still driving. Somewhere, someone was still buying groceries, still complaining about traffic, still arguing online about whether any of this was real.

Two minutes of mercy, and then the curtain.

Rina stood.

Not dramatically. Just the way Elias had stood, earlier, as if the body had decided sitting was no longer appropriate.

She took her headset off and set it down carefully, as if it were a ritual, like a tiny act of respect.

Her teammate swallowed. “Do we tell anyone?”

Rina looked at the blank carrier indicator, at the last VESPER packet frozen in the log, the final heartbeat of a machine that had done its job until it physically couldn’t.

“We already did,” she said, and it wasn’t bitterness. It was physics. “It just hasn’t arrived yet.”

She turned toward the door. Her legs felt borrowed, the same pins-and-needles unreality Elias had described, as if her nervous system were trying to negotiate a new contract with gravity.

“Come on,” she said.

He hesitated for half a second, then followed.

They left the submarine-dark room and stepped into the building’s hallway, where fluorescent lights still hummed, and someone’s distant laugh still existed, absurd and human.

They walked toward the exit because there were only two minutes left in the world where the sky was pretending.

And Rina, carrying the last words of a dead spacecraft in her pocket like a stone, wanted to be outside when the lie ended.

⸻

## T+08:08:00  
**Everywhere**

The light did not dim like sunset.

It stopped.

No warning slope. No courteous gradient. No cinematic fade where the world has time to rearrange its feelings. The day did not end.

It was removed.

One moment, there was ordinary winter sunlight lying on rooftops, on faces, on windshields, on snowbanks and sidewalks, and the thin steam rising from sewer grates. The next moment, that light was no longer participating in reality.

Day became the wrong kind of twilight in the space between one breath and the next.

Not night, not yet. Not the velvet comfort of a familiar dark. This was a sudden, bruised half-light, a dimness made from scattered sky and leftover glow and the thin mercy of an atmosphere still trying to behave as if it had a star.

Shadows didn’t lengthen.

They died.

The world’s edges softened as if someone had turned down the contrast on existence. Colors collapsed toward gray. The horizon did a strange thing, not darkening evenly but losing its authority, as if the landscape had forgotten how to look solid.

People looked up.

It’s what humans do when reality breaks: we search for the source.

People looked up and saw a Sun that wasn’t there.

Some screamed, high and involuntary, the pure animal sound that predates language. Some laughed once, a short broken laugh, and then stopped because nothing was funny anymore. Some went silent so hard it felt like a new kind of noise.

Dogs barked, frantic, the bark of creatures who knew the world’s rhythm had shifted and couldn’t understand why their humans weren’t fixing it. Birds exploded out of trees in chaotic swarms, then circled as if the sky itself had become untrustworthy. Streetlights flickered, hesitated, and began to come on in the middle of the day, their sensors confused by a darkness that didn’t carry the scent of evening.

Cars drifted.

Not all at once. Not like a movie pileup. The real version, messier: one driver braking too hard, another swerving, a few rolling on because people didn’t believe their eyes. A highway near Chicago became a slow, terrified river of brake lights. In Tokyo, commuters stopped on crosswalks and stared straight up between the towers. In Lagos, someone dropped a basket of fruit, and the oranges rolled into a gutter like miniature suns fleeing.

A child in a schoolyard asked, loud enough for the whole playground to hear:

“Where did it go?”

A teacher opened their mouth and found no sentence that didn’t sound like a lie.

In Boulder, alarms began to ring for reasons unrelated to space weather. Backup generators spun up. Grid control rooms lit with warnings as load profiles jumped in a way nobody had modeled: lights turning on everywhere at once, people rushing home, traffic signals stuttering, a thousand small systems trying to correct for a darkness that didn’t fit their rules. Phones began to overload networks with the exact two words, repeated in a million different languages.

The Sun.  
Gone.

In Haleakalā, Mara watched the empty feed and felt her body finally, properly, begin to understand what her mind had already known eight minutes too late.

She had been living in abstraction all day, in plots and overlays and spectral peaks. Abstraction was a kind of insulation. It lets you hold disaster at arm’s length long enough to describe it.

Now, through the glass of the observatory, the mountain’s world shifted. The bright blue sky became a washed, wrong color. The ocean horizon lost its sharpness. The sunlight that had been a physical presence on the building’s walls ceased.

And something in her stomach dropped, hard, as if her body had been waiting for the moment it could finally say, *This is real.*

Jun stood near her, mouth slightly open, not speaking. Someone in the room made a sound like a sob, trying to hide itself. The wall display showed nothing where the Sun had been, and the world outside began to match it.

Mara pressed her fingers to the edge of the console until she felt the bite of plastic.

History, she thought, doesn’t smell like warm plastic anymore.

History smells like the moment the lights go out.

In a cluttered office with too many coffee cups, Elias Venn lowered his head into his hands.

He didn’t cry. Not yet. Tears were slow. This was faster than tears.

For hours, he had wanted them to believe him, not for ego, not for a win, but for the terrible comfort of shared preparation. He had wanted colleagues to stop swatting at his words like they were flies. He had wanted someone, anyone, to say: *Okay. If you’re right, what do we do.?*

Now he would have given anything to believe that disbelief was true.

He heard the conference line still open on his speaker, a tapestry of human sounds. Someone is praying softly. Someone swearing. Someone asking questions no one could answer. DeShawn’s voice was trying to stay operational but failing because some events were too large to fit within the procedure.

Elias kept his face in his hands and whispered a sentence that wasn’t for them.

“I didn’t want to be right,” he said.

Outside his window, streetlights came on. The sky looked like late dusk without the beauty of evening. People stood in the street pointing upward, as if accusation could summon the star back.

And the cold began to write its first line.

Not instantly. Not in a Hollywood snap-freeze. The Earth’s oceans and air held heat the way a body holds warmth after the heart stops, residual and fading. But you could feel it, the beginning of the long slide. The moment the planet became a cooling ember instead of a living world.

Somewhere, in control centers and war rooms and kitchens and churches, a phrase began to spread, not as a meme or a hashtag, but as the first shared name for what was happening.

**The Long Night.**

Not a night you slept through.

A night you survived.

The first and ongoing long night of humanity.

The inciting incident, the pivot, the moment the species stopped being a terrestrial animal and became something else by necessity.

Because when your sun is taken, you don’t get to be normal anymore.

You get to choose what kind of creature you become in the dark.

And somewhere unimaginably far away, in a nebular pocket prepared like a cradle, a star arrived on schedule.

It did not arrive as a newborn. It came as an old furnace forced into obedience, still carrying the faint scar of a rhythm it had never evolved to obey. A metronome ghost threaded through its interior, a signature baked into plasma and field.

For the builders waiting in that prepared void, the arrival was a quiet success.

For Earth, the departure marked the start of an extinction clock counting down.

The sky held its breath.

Humanity did too.

And in the sudden, wrong twilight of a world without its nearest star, the question landed everywhere at once, heavy as gravity and sharp as hunger:

**What next?**

A bit about me: I’m African American, studying public health/business, and taking a break between terms to explore New Zealand slowly rather than speed-running it. I’m into long walks, good food, museums, nature, cafés, and thoughtful conversations. I’m not a big partier, but I’m always down for a coffee, a hike, a casual meal, or checking out a market or gallery.

I’ll be spending time in Auckland, Wellington, and the South Island (itinerary is flexible), and I’m especially interested in:

	•	Coffee walks / casual meetups

	•	Easy to moderate hikes

	•	Museums, talks, or cultural spots

	•	Local recommendations that aren’t on every travel blog

Not looking for anything romantic — just genuine human connection while traveling solo. Happy to verify I’m a real person via LinkedIn/IG if that helps folks feel comfortable.

If you’re open to meeting up, or if you have suggestions for places that are social-friendly for solo travelers, I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to comment or DM.

Thanks in advance — really excited to experience NZ beyond the postcard version 🙂

Late 20s solo traveler. I'm interested in doing Southern California. I don't drive. I see Carlsbad is attached to the Coaster line and I was exploring it as a walkable destination for a 3 or 4 night stay. I can take Ubers if they're available.

I love nature, definitely want to do the botanical garden (spring or autumn for it?), love good coffee and good food ideally in relaxed settings (tasting menus are kind of a lot for me to sit through), Pilates/yoga spots, checking out cool grocery stores with local stuff, museums, history.

My wife immigrated from Eastern Europe a few years ago, and socially it’s been a real struggle for her here.

She’s highly educated, childfree, and non-religious. Back home she was a veterinarian and is now working toward licensure in the U.S. The issue isn’t language. It’s cultural fit.

Most social interaction she encounters here revolves around kids, church, or heavy drinking. She doesn’t dislike kids and doesn’t judge anyone’s choices, but when those are the only topics, it becomes isolating. She also doesn’t drink, which further narrows social options.

She’s experienced a lot of condescension. People talking to her slowly, oversimplifying things, or not engaging her as a peer. Immigrant communities have been kinder, but they tend to be insular, often language-specific, and heavily centered around young families.

What she really needs isn’t a big friend group. Just one or two friends who enjoy meeting for coffee, talking about life, work, ideas, etc. Adult, peer-level friendships that aren’t defined by kids or religion.

We’re trying to figure out whether this is a Nashville/South issue or if this is just what most of the U.S. is like socially for childfree immigrants. Our biggest fear is going through the effort of moving and finding the same dynamics elsewhere.

Are there regions or specific towns in the U.S. where this kind of social environment is more common? Especially places that are more welcoming to educated immigrants and where childfree adults aren’t treated as outliers.

Wager Amount: 0.6U to WIN 1.05U

League: New Orleans Pelicans vs Atlanta Hawks (6:30PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: McJesus is on an absolute tear! Great matchup as I suspected! And I should have wagered on him to score the first goal in this game! I mean who else was going to be first against the Preys? Hyman and Draisaitl is a viable option but I would have gone wit Connor all day! He had a great look in the first couple minutes but that did not deter him to take another shot. He had 8 SOG and 2 goals in this game!

**Matchup:** Just because this is a near 2-1 odds does not mean I am going to avoid betting/handicapping this wager! That never scares me if it's got great potential I'm going to bet on it! Linesmaker get the odds and lines wrong all the damn time! **You can certainly catch them napping on undetected games and player props.** **I kno sharps actually studies games and players that the linemakers do not have in their system, but unfortunately I do not have that kind of resource and insights** (I just use all the free services like Google, Statmuse, and [ESPN.com](http://ESPN.com) just like most of you lol), but I do have a good feeling about this one today on Jalen Johnson to record a Trip-Dub against the Pelicans. 

It's a great matchup for JJ to record a trip-dub. **The Pellies are leading the league in allowing the most assists per game and they are 5th in the league for allowing rebounds per game.** JJ is very capable of exceeding double digits in every statistical category in the PAR department. He was close on his previous matchup and fell just 1 Ast short from hitting a trip-dub. Johnson was short-changed by a few minutes (played 34 mins) because of a blowout, but I think today it's going to be a lil' more competitive despite that Pellies are traveling on the road and playing b2b games, ultimately giving JJ max opportunity wit his average 38 minutes in this game.

This is Jalen's team now and wit Trae Young outta picture, he will take charge and make the right plays, ultimately feeding to his teammates, grabbing boards and scoring. The front office are fully on board for Jalen to be the franchise guy moving forward, he is going to prove that tonite.

[JJ has recorded a Trip-Dub 5 outta his last 15 games, but look how close he's been by 1 rebound or 1 assist in 5 other games. I like his chance today against Pellies.

1q6rg50,https://i.redd.it/ua8f9ojxqzbg1.jpeg,"Alright I have thoughts. KISS ‘Dynasty’, let’s talk about it.","Alright. Wife was on an important work call this morning and she kicked me out of the house for being too loud even though she’s the loudest person I know, so I drove around listening to Dynasty and went over to see the Wonder Years house and also got a horrific ice coffee at McDonalds ($.99 in the app, any size) which is generally ok but I went Hog Wild today and got 2 pumps of the French Vanilla and that put the Nasty in Dynasty. Don’t make that mistake, folks. Learn from my transgressions. 

Alright. It is a very interesting situation with this album. The band is back together but falling apart, members basically aren’t even on the album (Anton Fig should have gotten his own paint and character and I’m going to say don’t even paint his face, just paint his whole midsection down to his knees in white paint and then paint a cool looking Fig over his crotch, let’s go crazy here). 

I have no idea what Anton Fig looks like but I always picture Telly Savalas for no reason. 

Alright, so the band is falling apart and we decide we are going to go Disco for this one and we all feel good about bad decisions in the moment, we’ve all been there, some of us drink McDonalds coffee every day. 

The album seems to be much maligned. Old Guard KISSers hate this, and interestingly, even though it seems most “art” sees a slight bump in appreciation later on, I mean, even “Elder” kinda did, “Dynasty” really has not. Unless I just am wrong, who cares. 

Anyway. So Old Guard is on their knees throwing up all over the place and I’m sure some discoheads loved the single but I can’t imagine this garnered too many new fans to the band at the time or really ever since. 

But giving this a new listen all the way through for the first time in decades… I gotta say it, and I’m going to get killed for it, but this is a hidden gem album and dare I say their best hidden gem album. 

Let’s talk about that. 

First off, the single. It’s tough to be objective with things you are passionate about, but “I was Made for Loving You” is one of their best songs. It’s ok to disagree. I’m just giving my own opinion here. 

I’ve fought with KISS fans for decades on this. “Dressed to Kill” is not a great album. Sure there’s a couple songs I love. The defense always seems to be “But that’s the album with their biggest song ever”, and sure, fine. But if you’re going to use that to defend that album, then you can’t have it both ways with “Dynasty” and it having “I was Made for Loving You” which is a top 5 song of theirs. 

I’d say higher than Top 5 but I don’t want any boomers to have cardiac arrests on my conscience. 

Alright, so we right away have a Top Song on the album. Next best: “Sure Know Something”. This is one of Paul’s all timers, man. It is near the very top. Okay, that’s pretty strong so far, two heavyweights. 

“Magic Touch” is a deep cut that is excellent than I believe they never even played live. But is a  top KISS fan favorite deep cut for many. Okay, that’s 3 very strong defenses of “Dynasty” so far. 

“Charisma”. I love the music so much. It’s on every Gene mix I’ve made from cassettes to Spotify. A huge Gene hidden gem. Okay, that’s four. 

“2,000 Man”, we will get to more Ace in a minute, but this is a wonderful cover, probably better than the original, it is excellent. That’s five. 

“X-Ray Eyes”, who cares. Let’s say we are 5-1. 

“Save Your Love”, again we will get to Ace in a second. This song is whatever. It’s not horrendous, it’s not great, let’s agree it’s a tie. Now we are 5-1-1. 

Here is the most interesting part of this entire album and the whole situation. We get the absolute best songs from each of their KISS tenures from two of the original members of KISS. That’s pretty damn important, all things considered. 

“Dirty Livin’”. This is Peter Criss’s best song of his entire career. I won’t want to hear about “Beth”. It’s not great. Agree to disagree here and let’s not go to war over it. It’s cool if you dig it, I do not. 

When the aliens come here and I’m walking down the street minding my own business and they look me up and they look me down and they say “HEY MAN, tell us about Peter Criss” I am going to play them this song. It’s so Peter Criss. It’s 70s, it’s gotta that vibe and beat, his voice is perfect, the lyrics are perfectly Peter. It’s a wonderful magnum opus of that guy and his tenure. And the aliens will say “This is awesome, man, thank you, we are gonna take this back to our planet and tell everyone about Peter Criss.” 

Alright. “Hard Times”. This is going to be the single off my punk album when I start a band someday and speed this song up slightly. I don’t have a name yet for the band, I’m working on it. 

Much like Peter, we get the absolute best song of the Ace Frehley tenure in this band. It’s amazing that we get these two songs on the same damn album. It has historical importance. The song is fantastic. It is so perfectly Ace Frehley, and for anyone who followed his solo career, the lyrics are so Ace. It’s a great story in the song and the music is great. Bravo. 

Okay, so here we are. KISS “Dynasty”, over 40 years later, and I think this album is not only completely underestimated in terms of song value an historical KISStory, but it’s a major hidden gem that should be revisited and re-evaluated. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter, God bless the Chicago Bears, God bless the Calgary Flames, and God bless all the ships at sea.

1q6rg1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1q6rg1p/i_deleted_all_distractions_for_60_days_and_my/,I deleted all distractions for 60 days and my brain completely rewired,"

I was addicted to constant input. Phone while eating, YouTube while working out, podcast while driving, TV while cooking. I hadn’t experienced actual silence in probably 3 years.

The second I felt bored or uncomfortable, my hand would automatically reach for my phone. Waiting in line, sitting on the couch, lying in bed, even at red lights. I was terrified of being alone with my thoughts.

I didn’t even realize how bad it was until I tried to read a book one night and couldn’t focus for more than 30 seconds. My brain would wander, I’d feel anxious, and I’d grab my phone to check something. Anything. Just to feel that hit of stimulation.

That’s when I realized my attention span was completely destroyed. My brain had been rewired to need constant novelty and I couldn’t function without it.

So I made a decision: 60 days of zero unnecessary distractions. No phone during meals, no podcasts during drives, no TV as background noise, no scrolling when bored. Just me and whatever was actually happening in front of me.

What I actually did:

**Mornings in complete silence.** Coffee, breakfast, getting ready, all without checking my phone or turning on any media. Just sitting there existing. Brutal at first.

**Drives without podcasts or music.** Just driving and thinking. Or not thinking. Just being present with the road and my thoughts. Felt weird as hell for the first two weeks.

**Meals as actual meals.** No phone, no TV, no reading. Just eating and experiencing food. When I ate with other people, just conversation. When alone, just me and my thoughts.

**Workouts without content.** No YouTube videos, no music, no podcasts. Just me lifting weights or running in silence. My gym probably thought I was insane.

**Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks.** No more scrolling on the toilet for 20 minutes. Just doing what I came to do and leaving. Cut my bathroom time in half honestly.

**Waiting became waiting.** In line, at appointments, between tasks, I just waited. Didn’t pull out my phone. Didn’t look for something to consume. Just existed in the moment.

**Blocked everything during work hours.** Used this app called Reload to block all social media, YouTube, news sites, everything from 9am to 6pm. When distractions literally won’t open, you’re forced to sit with boredom.

## Days 1-7: Withdrawal was real

The first week I felt like I was losing my mind. My brain was so used to constant stimulation that silence felt physically uncomfortable. I was anxious, irritable, couldn’t sit still.

I’d reach for my phone dozens of times throughout the day and remember it was blocked or I’d made a rule not to use it. That moment of denial felt awful every single time.

Day 4 I almost quit. I was sitting at a red light with nothing to do and I felt this overwhelming urge to check my phone. My hand moved toward it automatically. I had to physically sit on my hand to stop myself. That’s when I realized how addicted I actually was.

## Days 8-14: My brain started adapting

Week two something shifted. During a silent drive I started actually thinking about things. Not just surface level thoughts, but deep reflection about my life, my relationships, decisions I needed to make.

I remembered conversations I’d had years ago. Random memories from childhood would pop up. Ideas for projects I’d been wanting to start. My brain was finally accessing information it had been too cluttered to reach.

During a silent meal I actually tasted my food for the first time in forever. I noticed textures, flavors, temperature. Eating became an actual experience instead of just something I did while scrolling.

## Days 15-30: Boredom became productive

By week three I started having ideas. Real ideas, not just thoughts. Solutions to problems I’d been stuck on at work. Concepts for side projects. Clarity about relationships and friendships.

I realized all these ideas had probably been trying to surface for months but my brain never had the space to process them because I was constantly feeding it input.

I solved a work problem during a silent drive that I’d been struggling with for weeks. Just randomly, the solution appeared fully formed. That never would have happened if I’d been listening to a podcast.

During workouts without music I started pushing harder because I was actually present with my body instead of distracted by content. I was more aware of form, fatigue, progress.

## Days 31-45: I started craving silence

This was the weirdest shift. I actually started looking forward to my silent morning coffee. To drives without podcasts. To meals without my phone. The boredom I’d been terrified of became peaceful.

I’d finish work and instead of immediately turning on TV or scrolling, I’d just sit on my couch for 10 minutes doing nothing. And it felt good. Restorative. Like my brain was finally getting the rest it needed.

My sleep improved dramatically. When you’re not constantly stimulating your brain, it actually knows how to shut down at night. I was falling asleep faster and sleeping deeper.

## Days 46-60: Everything felt clearer

The last two weeks I felt like a completely different person. My attention span came back. I could read for an hour without getting distracted. I could work on tasks for 2-3 hours straight without needing a dopamine hit.

Conversations became deeper because I was actually present. I wasn’t thinking about what to check on my phone or what video I wanted to watch later. I was just there, listening, engaging.

I started noticing things I’d been missing for years. Birds outside my window. The way light hits my apartment in the afternoon. Details in people’s faces when they talk. I’d been so distracted I’d stopped actually seeing the world around me.

## What actually changed after 60 days:

**My brain works again.** I can focus on difficult tasks for hours. I can read books and retain information. I can think deeply about complex problems. My attention span fully recovered.

**I have real ideas now.** Creative thoughts, solutions, insights, all coming naturally because my brain has space to process. I started two side projects from ideas that came during silent moments.

**I’m present with people.** My relationships improved because I’m actually there during conversations. Friends and family noticed the difference. My girlfriend said I seem more engaged and attentive.

**I’m calmer.** Not being constantly stimulated reduced my baseline anxiety significantly. I don’t have that restless feeling anymore. I can just be still.

**I enjoy small things.** A good meal, a nice drive, sitting outside, conversations, all became genuinely enjoyable instead of just time to fill with content. Life got richer.

**I sleep like a human.** Not consuming content before bed means my brain can actually wind down. I fall asleep in 10 minutes instead of scrolling for an hour.

**I know myself again.** Turns out I have thoughts, opinions, preferences that aren’t just reactions to whatever content I’ve been consuming. I remembered who I actually am.

## The reality, it was uncomfortable as hell

This was one of the hardest things I’ve done. Sitting with boredom and silence when you’re addicted to stimulation feels awful. There were days I wanted to give up and just go back to constant distraction.

But pushing through that discomfort revealed that I’d been avoiding myself. All that content consumption was just a way to not think about my life, my choices, my feelings. Once I stopped avoiding, I could actually address things.

## If you’re addicted to constant stimulation:

Start with one meal today. No phone, no TV, nothing. Just you and your food. See how uncomfortable it feels. That discomfort is showing you how dependent you’ve become.

Try one drive without a podcast. Just drive and let your mind wander. Notice how hard it is to not reach for audio content.

Sit somewhere for 5 minutes without pulling out your phone. Just sit. Just be. See what thoughts come up. Most of them will be “I should check my phone” at first. That’s the addiction talking.

Use blockers that actually enforce the rules. I used Reload to block everything during the day so I couldn’t cheat even when I wanted to. External enforcement works when willpower fails.

Give it time. The first two weeks are brutal. Week three is when it starts shifting. By week six you’ll actually crave the silence. Your brain needs time to heal from constant overstimulation.

Embrace the boredom. Don’t run from it. Sit with it. Let your mind wander. That’s where all the good stuff happens. Creativity, problem solving, self awareness, all require mental downtime.

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I was terrified of silence and bored. I needed constant input to function. My attention span was destroyed. My brain was cluttered. I’d forgotten who I was under all the content consumption.

Now I crave silence. I can focus for hours. I have ideas and insights. I’m present with people. I know myself again. My brain works the way it’s supposed to.

Two months of deliberately practicing boredom completely rewired my relationship with distraction and stimulation.

Your brain is more interesting than your phone. You just have to give it space to show you.

Start today. One silent meal. One quiet drive. Five minutes of sitting without reaching for your phone. See what shows up.

The person you’ve been avoiding with all that distraction is worth getting to know.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",22,1767819473.0,LockedInMan,7,0.82,False

I work in retail and there’s a coworker I’d really like to be friends with. We’ve been working together for about 2 months, but our shifts don’t overlap much, so we’ve only talked briefly a few times. She’s initiated some jokes, but I was pretty nervous and shy at first, so I feel like I didn’t fully match her energy.

We’re close in age, and she seems really cool and confident, which honestly makes me feel a bit intimidated. I really want to ask her if she’d like to grab a coffee, but I overthink timing and struggle with small talk. She’s also mentioned she’s seasonal, and I think her last shift might be this week, which makes it feel like now or never — but also potentially awkward since we don’t know each other well.

I’m not sure when or how to ask: during a break, at the end of a shift, or if it’s even okay to ask at all. How do you phrase it so it doesn’t feel like pressure or make things awkward if she says no?

I tend to assume rejection and talk myself out of trying, so I’d really appreciate any advice — especially from people who are shy or have been in similar situations.

1q6rfu7,https://i.redd.it/n4hwyt7mqzbg1.png,Boston Dynamics Atlas in Training at Hyundai: Clickbait or the Future of Manufacturing?,"***Hyundai plans to deploy 30,000 humanoid robots annually by 2028, starting in its Georgia factory. Is this revolutionary or just expensive theater in already automated plants?***



All Atlas deployments are already fully committed for 2026, with fleets scheduled to ship to Hyundai's Robotics Metaplant Application Center and Google DeepMind in the coming months. This isn't vaporware. This isn't another Tesla Optimus embarrassment with a guy in a morphsuit. Hyundai Motor Group plans to mass produce humanoid robots in Georgia and put them to work helping real humans build cars in the same factory. Production. Not prototypes. Not concepts. Actual deployment starting in 2028.

**What Atlas Actually Does**

In October, a 5 foot 9 inch, 200 pound Atlas was put to the test at Hyundai's new Georgia factory, where it practiced autonomously sorting roof racks for the assembly line. Not welding. Not precision assembly. Sorting roof racks. By 2030, Atlas robots will be trained to assemble vehicle components. Over time, they'll take on more complex jobs that involve repetitive motions and heavy loads, making work safer and less taxing for factory employees.

The capabilities are real. Its limbs have a reach of about 7.5 feet and lift up to 110 pounds. The robot can operate in temperatures ranging from minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The robot can be controlled in three different ways: fully autonomous mode, with an operator using hand controls, or using a tablet to direct its actions.

**Why Humanoid? Factories Are Already Automated**

Here's the critical question: automotive factories already use thousands of robots. BMW's Spartanburg plant has robotic welding. Mercedes uses automated assembly lines. Tesla's gigafactories are famous for automation. So why do you need a humanoid robot specifically?

Scott Kuindersma, head of robotics research at Boston Dynamics, said a lot of this has to do with how we're going about programming these robots now, where it's more about teaching and demonstrations and machine learning than manual programming. Traditional industrial robots are bolted to the floor, programmed for specific tasks, and require complete production line redesigns when products change.

Atlas is different. Wearing a virtual reality headset, machine learning scientist Kevin Bergamin took direct control of the humanoid and guided its hands and arms through each task until Atlas succeeded. That generates data that we can use to train the robot's AI models to then later do that task autonomously. Once one was trained, they were all trained. Teach one Atlas to sort roof racks. Every Atlas globally gains that capability immediately.

The humanoid form factor matters because factories are designed for humans. We would like robots that could be stronger than us or tolerate more heat than us or definitely go into a dangerous place where we shouldn't be going. You don't need to redesign workstations, doorways, or assembly lines. Atlas walks through the door like a person. Picks up tools designed for human hands. Operates in spaces built for human dimensions.

**This Is Real, Not Sensationalism**

The roadmap includes a plan to manufacture 30,000 Atlas humanoid robots a year by 2028 at its sprawling high tech Metaplant near Savannah and then integrate them into its factories and warehouses worldwide. Thirty thousand units annually. That's not a pilot program. That's industrial scale production.

From 2028, Atlas will be introduced into workflows with demonstrated safety and quality gains, such as parts sequencing. By 2030, deployments are expected to expand to component assembly and, over time, to repetitive, heavy, and complex operations across entire production sites. Phased rollout over years. Start simple. Add complexity gradually. This is how serious companies deploy new technology, not how hype machines operate.

Boston Dynamics said it deployed more than 500 robots in 2025, generating around $130 million in revenue across Spot quadrupeds and the Stretch trailer loading system. They're already shipping profitable robots. Atlas isn't their first rodeo.

Compare that to Tesla. Remember when Elon Musk predicted that there would be thousands of Optimus robots at Tesla factories by the end of 2025? Well, that didn't happen. Not only did that not happen, but Musk's claim Tesla would produce 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus robots in 2025 butted up hard against the embarrassing reality that Optimus isn't only behind the curve, but likely doesn't have any autonomous capabilities at all.

**The Google DeepMind Factor**

Boston Dynamics announced a partnership with Google DeepMind that aims to integrate cutting edge Google DeepMind foundation models into Atlas to give the robot greater cognitive capabilities. This changes everything. Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, said tasks that require certain sensors the robot doesn't have are still limited, but the robot can learn almost anything you can consistently demonstrate through teleoperation.

Collecting real world data is expensive, so DeepMind is exploring methods that allow Atlas to learn without needing to see every object in advance. That's the breakthrough. Current robots need to be programmed for every specific part, every specific task. AI powered Atlas learns generalized manipulation. Show it how to handle one type of component. It figures out how to handle similar components without additional programming.

Data collected from Hyundai factories will feed the RMAC (Robot Metaplant Application Center), creating a controlled environment for Atlas to train on complex tasks. Every factory becomes a training ground. Every task performed generates data. Every Atlas improves because of collective learning. That's fundamentally different from traditional automation.

**What This Actually Means**

Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said the really repetitive, really backbreaking labor is really going to end up being done by robots. But these robots are not so autonomous that they don't need to be managed. They need to be built. They need to be trained. They need to be serviced.

This isn't replacing workers wholesale. Hyundai frames this effort as human centered automation: robots take on labor intensive or high risk work, while people retain control, training systems, supervising operations, and defining how automation is applied. The humans shift from doing repetitive physical work to training and managing robots that do that work.

Will jobs disappear? Obviously some will. At first, they'll work on tasks with proven safety and quality benefits, such as parts sequencing. Those sequencing jobs won't exist for humans anymore. But Hyundai plans to invest 125 trillion won in South Korea over the next five years in AI, robotics, and other technologies, along with $26 billion in the U.S. through 2028. That's infrastructure requiring workers, robot maintenance requiring technicians, AI training requiring specialists.

**The Competition Is Real**

Tesla is developing its Optimus robot, Chinese EV maker Xpeng has unveiled its Iron humanoid, and Toyota operates an advanced robotics program and in 2024 partnered with Hyundai to accelerate development. BMW is testing Figure AI's robots. Mercedes invested in Apptronik. Every major automaker recognizes this technology matters.

This generation of Atlas significantly reduces the amount of unique parts in the robot, and every component has been designed for compatibility with automotive supply chains. With Hyundai Motor Group's backing, we will achieve the best reliability and economies of scale in the industry. Using automotive supply chains to build robots means costs drop dramatically. Economies of scale kick in. What costs millions per unit today costs tens of thousands at volume.

**Is This Sensationalism?**

No. This is the logical evolution of industrial automation. Factories are already extensively automated. But that automation is inflexible, expensive to reconfigure, and limited to highly structured tasks. Humanoid robots bring flexibility. They work in spaces designed for humans. They learn tasks through demonstration rather than programming. They improve collectively through shared learning.

Are factories devoid of humans? Not remotely. Walk through any automotive plant. You'll see thousands of workers alongside robotic welders and automated conveyors. The humans do final assembly, quality checks, problem solving, and anything requiring judgment or adaptation. Robots do repetitive, dangerous, physically demanding tasks.

Atlas expands what robots can handle while maintaining human oversight. It's evolutionary advancement, not revolutionary replacement. The hype comes from humanoid form factor and AI capabilities making robots more versatile than before. But the underlying goal remains constant: automate dangerous, repetitive work while humans handle complexity and oversight.

There are no humanoids that do most of the routine tasks that people do in their daily lives nearly as well as a person. Atlas can't pour coffee competently. It can lift 110 pounds repeatedly for hours without breaks, in temperatures humans can't tolerate, with precision humans can't match after the hundredth repetition. That's the advance. Not replacing humans. Augmenting what automated systems can do in human designed spaces.

Sensationalism would be claiming Atlas eliminates factory workers. Reality is Atlas sorts roof racks starting in 2028, expands to component assembly by 2030, and slowly takes over physically demanding tasks while creating new roles for robot trainers, maintenance technicians, and system supervisors. That's not exciting enough for headlines. But it's what's actually happening.",2,1767819459.0,MotorBuzz,2,1.0,False

No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

Last year, I was studying in the library. I left for a few minutes to grab a coffee. When I came back, my backpack was still there, but my wallet and my iPad were gone.

I went straight to campus security. While I was reporting it, I got a text from my bank saying my balance was **$0**. I had about **$500** in my account. That’s how I found out I had been robbed.

Police wrote a report and told me they’d “do their best.” Because the loss was under $5,000, it wasn’t treated as a priority. Even though I knew **exactly which LCBO my card was used at**, no one even attempted to contact the store or check cameras. Nothing happened.

Now we learn that the person charged in the UTSC shooting was **not a student**, was **on parole**, and had **prior firearm-related offences**.

So let’s stop pretending this is unpredictable.

UofT allows unrestricted access to libraries and campus buildings. Anyone can walk in. Students are expected to just accept that, even after repeated thefts, assaults, and now a shooting.

We pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition. Basic safety is not a “nice to have.”

**UofT needs to:**

* Require **student ID access** for libraries and academic buildings
* Take campus theft and safety reports seriously, regardless of dollar value
* Be transparent about who is allowed on campus and why
* Stop reacting *after* students are harmed

This is not about fear-mongering. It’s about accountability.

Students shouldn’t have to wait for something worse to happen before the university decides safety matters.

UofT must do better, and students need to start demanding it.",86,1767819314.0,UTSC,24,0.91,False

So I was doing my nails and was prepping some 100% acetone, and like an absolute idiot I put it in a plastic shot glass without thinking. Of course, the acetone ate through the plastic and soaked through onto my coffee table, which left me with this when I wiped it off as soon as I noticed. 

According to the website of the company I bought it from the table is made from poplar veneer, but that's really all of the info it gives in terms of materials. The table itself is undamaged as far as I can tell, just all of the paint / stain that is on the top has of course come off. The beige part also seems to be some sort of paint or something too. For now, I wiped off everything I could and let it dry as best as possible.

I have a few of those wood markers and crayons for small spot fixes, but none of the colors match the table perfectly and I think this is too big of an area anyway. I also do art, so I could probably make a pretty good color match of table with paint, but that does still leave a few issues with the grain and having to buy a sealant as well.

I’m looking for some help because I’ve been struggling for a long time to get a decent espresso.

I’m using a Delonghi Dedica (it has been repaired and had some parts replaced in the past) and a Kingrinder K6. My beans are Brazilian (medium roast).

My current setup:

* Delonghi Dedica
* Kingrinder K6
* Bottomless portafilter + stock portafilter

The main issue is that I cannot get a good shot at all. I’ve tried different approaches, but nothing seems to work consistently.

What I’ve tried so far:

* Dose: 16g
* Grind size: 35–36–37 clicks on the K6
* Both bottomless and stock portafilters

Problems I’m seeing:  
With some grind sizes, the portafilter starts shaking a lot, and it even feels like it’s struggling to stay locked in place during extraction  
  
This makes me think something might be off with the grind size, pressure, or puck prep, but I’m honestly not sure what parameter to adjust next

At this point, I feel a bit lost about what I should focus on changing first (grind size, dose, yield, puck prep, machine limitations, etc.).

I’d really appreciate any advice, suggestions, or similar experiences with the Dedica + K6 combo.

That was pretty good! I'm not entirely sure Oliver is completely on their side, but probably as long as he can occasionally research things lol. It's quite smart that Thomas gives Barbie poison lol, but also super smart. Keeping her in the children's building seems to give him a lot of authority because of Barbara's enormous amount of soot

It's pretty interesting he'd just tell that to Lewis out of the blue though. Not sure he's entirely on his side yet, even though he seems to like him more than Edward.

Is Edward's entire mission outside going to be a complete failure? I doubt Thomas's influence will waver much as long as Barbara is on the 1st floor, and as for now, Edward doesn't even know how important Barbara is to Thomas,

He can also probably get anyone Edward brainwashed back on his side by telling it to them, but at this point that info may be leaked. Lewis may leak it, too

Would Edward try to weaken Barbara and Barbie, or do the opposite?? At one point, she feels like the center of attention. 

1) Thomas finding her gives him alot of influence and she's the reason for that as of now

2) Edward will most likely try to either weaken her so that she cant emit as much soot or do the complete opposite and befriend her, heal Barbie's face and get her promoted to be an adult once he finds that she's one of Thomas's crucial pieces

3) Kate is already on good terms with Barbara and already tried to make an ally out of her. Patrick is, just as of now is on good terms with her aswell

4) Douglas making the right move with the disciplinary team made her approve of the disciplinary team

I guess her position as the head of the star bearers and being an enormous soot generator has to do alot with that. The treatment she's getting is quite cruel though. She's just getting used for her soot and ontop of that Barbie's given poison and is tricked to believe Christopher is alive. I wonder which team she'll end up on? I feel like Kate and others would be able to get through her

Also, regardless of Oliver's intentions and current loyalty to Kate, he's an extremely powerful Ally. Not only he's a star bearer, but his inventions could be really useful, not even  just the one about detecting lies - i feel like he could cook up another useful device aswell. Hopefully next time they'll actually get to make use of it, though

I did anticipate Patrick's soot power although it was kinda obvious from the heart, so that's cool. He didn't just do that because of his love to Emilyko either, proven by him later looking in the mirror, but that could've been the trigger for his soot power. I'm pretty curious as to what it could be. I feel like given it's the latest, it could be the most useful one so far

I think that after figuring out who the culprit is and proving it, Kate's influence might grow even further and the next thing she should do is get closer to Barbara. She is pretty important, after all. 

I feel like if Edward finds out about Barbara's significance, he's more likely to make contact with her but then again, Barbara doesn't trust him. After all, she's still under the impression she was given a fake coffee, since they did do alot of precautions for it but Kate managed to replace it either way. So maybe if she doesn't trust him, Edward's better off attacking her or doing something to make her emit less soot

Could there be something that does that? It is also said that adults don't have to emit soot because of Barbara. Is emitting soot so inconvinient for the adults? Also the fact that adults ""Don't have to"" emit soot because of her means they have an option to do that. So it probably doesn't have to do with the unification ritual. 

Right now i'm seeing that Edward's plan should fail whatever it is or has to do with growing influence and making allies amongst other adults because of Barbara, And if he does figure that much out, he'd likely have both Thomas's group and Kate's to deal with. I feel like Kate may try to aid Barbara against Edward as he's his common enemy. 

Would that make things too easy though? Thomas doesn't so far hold any grudges or biases against Kate, but i feel like she may make an enemy out of him anyway because afterall he's just another shadow loyal to the house tryna rank up

Douglas's upcoming, probably, failure because of how close Kate is to figuring out who the culprit is probably going to increase Kate's influence even more and make it easier for her to make friends with people. Maybe she'll finally become a star-bearer? And that'd be good, because she'd likely not be considered for an ascension to the next floor, which is good since she won't have to do the unification ritual

But that's if.. If she doesn't, not sure how that influence would affect her - at the very least everyone will finally stop meatriding the discipllinary team so that's something, but if she crosses the ""star bearer candidate influence"" and  enters the""Unification ritual potential candidate"" lines, that feels like it'd be real bad

I wonder how other people would get rewarded too. Now she has Oliver helping her. Last time only Kate received something significant but louise and patrick did receive gifts. Maybe some of em will become team leaders aswell? Well, Kate becoming a star bearer would do more good for sure. Maybe Sara's dumbass will finally become a team leader, then.. Then again, if Kate chooses, both Louise and Belles, AND probably whoever the new member of her team would be (Since she'll prob leave it upon becoming a star bearer) would be a better pick  than Sara because she's an asshole. But doing that would probably make Sara completely hopeless and angered towards Kate, meh, not sure that's this big of a problem

Also i'm not sure proving they're culprits would do this much.. Afterall, Thomas's new rule doesn't exactly make everyone wanna rush to find the culprits, in fact the opposite, to look down on the weak. Perhaps at the end of this arc there'll be a somewhat similar fight or a challenge to my beloved action in debut & robe sama arcs

I feel more satisfied with this essay then the previous. After all, the previous 4 eps i've red were mostly just action stuff and i mostly just described the ep and provided small theories there and there as i read through it. Here i actually theorized on things alot more

That being said though, the eps itself are rated quite significantly lower. That is because the theories provided by all of those are definetely a part of the fun but aren't quite included in an episode, although i guess that may be unreasonable. After all, most of these thoughts came simply from Thomas revealing he's giving fake medicine to Barbara and is using her as pawn in obtaining influence

Idk, whatever, if i actually gave more points to whatever chapters issued those theories, i feel like it'd be higher, but i don't think it matters. Afterall i just rate the chapters for my overall enjoyment and not the theories that come after

Chapter 139 - 9.7/10   
Chapter 140 - 10/10  
Chapter 141 - 9.5/10  
Chapter 142 - 9.5/10

Holy, this part was absolute peak. I can't even describe it quickly, Kate's plan was extremely good, she even figured out that he's connected to Gilbert aswell as an Adult

The execution was flawless, there's quite a visible hint about Gilbert's cooperation (Since as Kate said, forming of the disciplinary team would be left up to chance as long as the duel doesn't take place. And besides that, Gilbert quite literally just attacked him once, got hit once and blocked it and that's it)

Gotta give Gilbert and Douglas some credit aswell - they orchestrated everything super well, and ontop of that, made it seem as if it was Elizabeth's and Loretta's fault by combining their powers and making them seem as the powers of those two. However, unfortunately for them, Kate not only proved it was possible to do with their powers, aswell as that they were the only ones to have a motive behind it - but also that they actually did it by collecting evidence in form of small details & differences to prove that their power isn't what it seems to be

John's duel idea though.. kind of ruined lots of things, and is a huge risk considering Gilbert's insane power, ontop of that, John failed to hide his ability well enough leading him to know what it is. To give John credit, Water idea was pretty good, but yeah, not that much.. Wonder how the duel will end, but that's at the start of the next volume

Also i'm assuming Gilbert watched Kate not just before from the ghost disturbance arc but also right now because that's how he was able to make an appearance just as Kate deduced he's cooperating with him. However, i'm unsure he was able to see all of it.. Well, thing is, since his expectations about Kate having the same objectives as him were betrayed, it probably means he didn't know Kate made friends with the star bearers, especially Oliver who's now her close ally and even was able to attend a meeting with the others from the debutant class

I still assumed Kate relying on John here was way too risky of a plan, but hopefully John will win now.. Since Kate going up against the star bearers would mean Oliver aswell which is impossible in her case, so yeah, too great of a risk.. Unless she just goes back on her word, lol, that'd be funny. Then again, he tried to hit her which made John come out, which means without him Kate might've not made it out,  but eh, maybe he shouldn't have made it a duel

Not sure there's alot of things to theorize on, i'll try to ask myself questions to go from here, maybe that'll help. 

1) How will the fight unfold??

At first i thought of them using the disguise strategy again, but it seems impossible because 1. Shaun's face is there, a mask and a suit to resemble skin seems far too unlikely, however, they do have Oliver, so maybe... 2. that'd mean a living doll participated in the fight right until the Shaun, who's actually John attacks him from behind. That wouldn't be fair given Gilbert's living doll didn't help him

What does that leave us.. Well, that COULD be prevented by masking it as if John (Shaun wearing the shadow suit) hit him, or as a soot power which John didn't yet ""mention"", but that does seem impossible with Douglas team spectating, while they're atleast not interfering for now, i doubt they'd just stay silent about Kate and John cheating - Although Elizabeth and Loretta would prob stay silent, it doesn't make a difference

Is Patrick's soot power, unknown to us yet able to change the fight? If it does, it has to be a power that he's able to use masking it as John's power, while still maintaining his hidden appearance to not make it obvious the debutant class is working together, but for that he'd also need to change the fight.. Not sure what that'd be, and the heart appearing above his head doesn't tell us much about his power and especially doesn't look like it'd take an effect on the fight

Is the Duel a set up? Kate seemed surprised with John's idea, so i doubt that is true, unless it was shown that way on purpose to not hint Kate's into the plan already. If it is, than all John has to do is wait for Star bearers to come and see it all for themselves, and then act like it was never a duel in the first place. As i mentioned earlier with another theory, which is likely impossible, Douglas and Gilbert will try to say as if it was a duel, but since they're all apart of the culrpit team, they'll not be believed. And Elizabeth & Loretta will just stay silent lol. 

If Kate & John have a different secret trick up their sleeve, what is it?

There could be more water set up around the room, but it doesn't look like it's working well enough. Could John have some kind of water gun in one of his pockets??? Ehh, unlikely

Could it be a trap? Maybe.. Or John can try to make him hit the floor and use that as an ope ning? Eh, i'm unsure.. I'm probably out of ideas, i like the idea that the duel is a setup the most. Speaking of that, maybe the set up will be unintentional, for example the star bearers will come on their own or are called by elizabeth/loretta that left the room (Or Patrick/Louise/Oliver)  
  
Maybe it has to do something with Oliver's inventions, he might've invented something to aid them in their upcoming fight. 

2) What happens to Kate and others after she wins/loses? 

If she wins, the star bearers would probably show her a lot of gratitude and Gilbert & Douglas's team will be punished. Maybe as i said before, Kate will be a star bearer, gain something great, whether it's an item or information, or others from her class may be made team leaders

It'll also depend whether Gilbert would keep the promise or not - but as much as it could be a lie, i don't see him having as large of a resolve to lie as Kate, since Kate would have to give up her friendship with the star bearers and Douglas's team might rise even more in influence, which are affiliated with Edward. Meanwhile, Gilbert can still work with her and go along with her plan

Let's just assume Gilbert doesn't lie and John wins for now - Douglas's team might attack both of them and then a fight would unfold - a 5v4 = Kate, Elizabeth, Loretta and (likely exhausted) Gilbert and John versus all members of Douglas's team, which while were also exhausted, got quite some breathing room

If she doesn't win, things will get rough, but most likely the star bearers would be demoted and maybe she can obtain a position by working together with Gilbert later

All leads down to me thinking the duel wasn't a good idea.. Meh, Kate probably wouldn't agree to it and would stop John if she doesn't have a few tricks up her sleeve.. I feel like she'll win, i wonder how though. The ""setup"" theory seems the best for now, even if it contradicts Kate's thinking.

He’s gotten clean now but I’ve lived on and off with my mother for my whole life more so with my grandmother who just passed away I’m now 25 with my own daughter and I’m fed up with my mom‘s behavior, I just recently blocked her because the last straw happened when she stole money from me which I don’t care about the money she tried to pay me back, but she didn’t pay it in full and when she didn’t pay in full, I said OK obviously you don’t respect my time you don’t respect me. You don’t care to pay me back because you don’t think I’m gonna do anything about it so I just recently blocked her on everything she somehow gotten in touch with me to tell me that she’s mad and that she can’t believe I’m kicking her out of my life for $30 and of course she would say that when that’s not the reason that’s the least of my concerns. It’s about the respect 

six months ago, her mother, my grandmother who basically raised me passed away from leukemia. I had to be there while my mom was drugged out going off doing what she wanted to while her mother lay dying. I had to minister medicine, which I was happy to do, but it was hard. I needed my mom. She refused to be there. She said she couldn’t handle it, that was too much for her she said… even though I was crying and begging her to stay, she left then she stole money from my grandma on her death bed,  and of course, she tried to lie once my grandmother was already dead and says that grandma told her she could have It that was her mom and why would she lie

 I’ll tell you why she would lie because she’s done this before when my grandmother lay in the hospital before sick as a dog she stole money and took advantage of my grandmother and that’s one thing I’ll say my grandmother is always giving her everything she ever wanted helped her, even though she swore she wasn’t going to every time my mom goes to prison she puts money on her books so forth and on all the way until the day she passed. I should’ve blocked my mom and left it at that because it’s been years of my mom being a narcissist being angry neglectful to me and my brother‘s as children. She has two other children that she has adopted out well they got taken from her, and then adopted and me, and my brother were lucky enough that our family took us in while my mom did what she wanted. 

when she did that to my grandmother, it broke me, but I still decided to give her a chance after chance and I will say it’s not that she doesn’t fully try. Sometimes she’ll come around and she’ll buy me things or she’ll buy my daughter stuff and then she’ll dip out. And then when I bring it up later that I don’t ever hear from her that she’s always choosing her boyfriends they abuse her or friends of hers that are also on drugs instead of being with her family she claims well I did show up and buy this. What about that and I feel like that’s her way of being narcissist And trying to make it seem like the bare minimum is still something which it is and I tell her that, but at the same time I’m still hurt she never apologizes. She never admits her wrongs. 

Well fast-forward to now. She just got locked up in Florida. Don’t ask me how she ended up there And of course now she’s calling cause she knows she’s probably about to go back to prison and she wants me to get her into a rehab here in Alabama where I live she wants me to call this person and call that person and can I get her a coffee pack when she gets back to Georgia cause they’re coming to pick her up and she’s crying and she’s saying she knows she messed up and she wants to be a better grandmother but I just don’t know how to go about this cause I told myself I’d be strong this time
That I wouldn’t give into her that I wasn’t gonna put money on the books like my grandmother did because she needs tough love her and my brother both he is also in prison getting everything they want while they’re in prison. My brother gets it from his baby mama. I can’t tell her nothing and he’s full-blown psychotic as well. 
My mom used to get it for my grandmother and now that my grandmother is no longer here I knew she was gonna call me and of course I feel bad and of course I told her I said you can come to Alabama and go to rehab if you’re serious if we can get Probation transfer, but of course this comes with a bunch of phone calls. I’m gonna have to be on the phone. I’m gonna have to find her bed. I’m going to have to pay to get her transferred and for the bed at the rehab. How do I set boundaries but also help her at the same time cause she’s 47 she doesn’t have much time left to get her life together or she’ll either die from not taking care of herself or she’ll continue to use until she’s 60 and then die, which means we’ll never have a relationship. How do I deal with this properly but also not give into her and give her exactly what she wants.",2,1767818714.0,narcissisticparents,3,1.0,False

1q6r2qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/automation/comments/1q6r2qw/quill_automates_ai_review_publishing_with_make/,Quill - Automates AI Review Publishing with Make and WordPress,"I just scripted a brilliant automation for a niche reviewer in Bologna who was spending nights crafting product posts. Pulling data from Google Sheets, summoning AI for intros, descriptions, and narratives, scraping images, building sitemaps, and publishing to WordPress was turning deep research into endless typing. So I created Quill, an automation that writes like a possessed pen, turning raw product rows into rich, ready-to-rank reviews that flow straight to the blog.

Quill uses Make as the inkwell and WordPress as the parchment. It’s swift, clever, and runs with Italian flair. Here’s how Quill composes:

1. New rows in Google Sheets trigger Quill to grab keywords, styles, and prompts.
2. AI weaves intros, quotes, list sections, and full descriptions in parallel streams.
3. Tools aggregate details, hunt images, parse text, and generate affiliate links plus XML sitemaps.
4. Iterators handle batches, while final paths upload media, convert markdown, and create polished WordPress posts.
5. The reviewer gets one dawn Slack note: “Quill published 22 reviews overnight, images checked, sitemaps updated. Your coffee is waiting.”

This setup is pure Bologna content craft for affiliate bloggers, review sites, or any creator scaling with AI. It turns mechanical writing into effortless artistry and lets the human focus on insight, not input.

Happy automating, and may your posts always captivate.",0,1767818622.0,automation,2,0.5,False
1q6r2on,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6r2on,2025: Coffee in Review,"My first time collecting all my bags from the year and doing a recap!! 

Such a fun year of pour-overs at home. I got a Ceado Hoop at the end of 2024 and used it tons this year, with a little Kalita Wave 155 and V60 here and there too.

Really explored experimental process this year, and Colombian coffee was my clear favorite 🤩

Overall favorite:
Hambela from Sweet Bloom
• Plain delicious in all formats, including espresso. Strong berry presence and milky chocolate — mmm.

Most memorable:
“Grape Soda” by B&W or “Watermelon Co-ferment” from Brainwave
• Huge grape Big League Chew and watermelon Jolly Rancher vibes, respectively. Pretty sure I bought a second bag of each.

Best roaster:
S&W
• Everything I got ruled. The lulo had an amazing grapefruit note, loved the strawberry co-ferment, and that natural Ethiopian was giving huge “raspberry cheesecake” vibes.

Least memorable:
“Maguta” from B&W
• Never could get much out of this one (or a few others from B&W, tbh).

Most fun:
“Green Apple” Honey Process by S&W
• So fun in the fall — Granny Smith tartness with apple pie sweetness.

1q6qyar,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1q6qyar/short_story/,short story!,"Jasmine stared at the blank page in front of her, which reflected her exact mental state at the moment. Absolutely blank. Zilch. Nada. Her weary gaze shifted to the bin she kept on the side of the desk, which crumpled pieces of lined paper filled to the brim. She was close to calling it a day, as she absentmindedly spun her fountain pen on her ink stained fingers. Yet the memory of her last check - the progression of the slowly dwindling zero’s on each one before that, kept her rooted in her seat. 2 pages, that's all she resolved. Two pages of quality writing. And with that newfound inspiration, she got to work, scraping each half formed idea from the corners of her mind, and attempting to assemble into something with a mind of its own. That was the best way to write - let the story write itself and imagine oneself as the guiding hand turning the pages, unravelling the knots, to reveal the glorious tapestry that was always there. But as pen was put to paper, something peculiar started to occur. An unravelling - yes - but not of a story, but of the fabric of reality instead. 



Something was terribly amiss, yet Jasmine, lost in her tale was oblivious to the changes occurring around her. For instance, she had started to write, not realising that she was simply etching out past events - but with a twist. That being she wrote the past the way she had wanted it to unfold.Bad first dates, embarrassing moments, times where she tasted failure, were simply erased. Not only was the past rewritten, she poured out her dreams onto the yellow lined notebook she wrote in. Etched out every hope she had with her feathered fountain pen - in her eyes, marking her as an author, every time the ink blotted and the pen scratched. Using a fountain pen was a way of paying penance to her craft, to taste the thrill of writing that had been carried through time. Sometimes she would pay homage in other ways, lighting a few candles and stimulating inspiration in that way. Yet today, no candles were lit - no candles were needed in the fervent haze jasmine had found herself wrapped in. And so she wrote, and wrote, and wrote, time slipping from her grasp. 



The clock had completed half a rotation by the time Jasmine finally hit her pillow, exhausted in the satisfying way one can only be when attending to their craft. Yet the words seemed to take hold, fly off the pages and vanish into the air into a splendour of fireworks. It was a shock indeed when she woke up, and in the steaming sun, realised she couldn’t find her work anywhere. Simply misplaced, she thought. Perhaps absent mindedly threw into the heap of crumpled yellow paper she had deemed rubbish. So she stretched her weary limbs, drank in the brilliant late morning rays and gently exhaled into her steaming mug of thick coffee, before going about her day. She stepped foot outside, met with gorgeous blue expanse stretching for days and walked to her local cafe. Yet she could swear that strangers stared at her differently. With something like awe in their eyes. Odd. Perhaps the makeup she had lazily slapped on had done its job that morning. It was only a lick of mascara and concealer, with scrawled on light red lipstick but something was different. Unbeknownst to her, she was glowing. At least it seemed so, some sort of halo effect shrouding her being - for she had written in first person. “Jasmine was angelic”. The effects were far reaching, and miles away Enes started dreaming about an angelic girl he had once known, his heart tugging for something more, with something like regret etched on his sleeping features. 



Everywhere Jasmine went, people noticed. Jasmine, used to be being somewhat invisible was taken aback by the sudden change. Yet it wasn’t all bad, she had thought, until the following day. She had ran into her friend, and for once in her life, she was the sun, not the sunflower, yearning to bask in her friends glow. The conversation was uninterrupted, she had let her talk freely, even looked at her with something akin to wonder in her eyes.

Robin dropped the bag and pulled the mask off their face. ""alright well done everyone! Flawless execution. The bag will stay here for a few days and then we can move it on once the heat is off.""

The group nodded, and a few high fives and hugs were thrown around, and then everyone turned and looked at Robin again.

""well?"" Selene prompted, ""now what?""

""we're done! Go home, get some sleep.""

Tim coughed. ""uh... what about the post-action huddle, boss? You know, what went well, what went poorly, what should we change for next time? kudos and points of interest?""

""oh uhhh. We could do that, I guess. If you wanted?""

the group was silent for a few seconds, until Robin spoke again. ""So Tim, you wanna start us off, what something that went well?""

""oh uh... I hadn't thought about it yet. Um, I'll just give a big kudo to Uran, they did an excellent job cracking the safe quickly.""

""Right."" Robin said, ""okay, kudos for Uran. Uhhh Do you have anything to add here Uran?""

Uran shifted nervously, tapping their foot. ""Uh, sure? I met my KPI target by opening the safe in under four minutes, and am happy that that was recognized. Uhhh, thank you.""

""Alright, thanks for that Uran. Anyone else have anything to add?""

Val put up his hand. ""Uh I'd just like to give Robin kudos for planning this. Feels great to help out the orphans. Like we're Robin's merry men. But uh..."" Val glanced around at the group, ""less manly.""

""Thanks for that Val. Uhh I think that wraps it up, if you're all ready to get going?""

Selene put her hand up, and Robin nodded at her. ""Uh yeah, I was thinking that we should all do like a breathing exercise or something, you know? An emotional exhale. Get all the stress out.""

""uh, yeah? Sure? If everyone else is fine with that?""

the group all nodded and muttered in agreement, and then looked at Rowen, who looked at Selene.

""Selene?"" Robin prompted, ""could you guide us through this exhale?""

""Oh!"" Selene seemed startled, but quickly gathered herself into an upright posture. ""So basically we're all just gonna breathe together. Slow and controlled. Just for a minute or so. Follow my lead.""

Selene started breathing in and out slowly, and the group followed suit somewhat awkwardly.

""Well, that does feel better!"" Robin said ""If no one else has anything for us we can get going!""

Uran raised their hand. ""So Robin where's the afterparty?""

""Afterpary?""

""Yeah, you know. Eat some food. Relax""

Wexler straightened his vest and cleared his throat as detective Zunion came up to his desk. ""Sir, we've got in the initial report.""

""let's hear it then!""

""Yes sir. The initial robbery was performed on may 15th 2025, funds were seized from a safe owned by one Mr. Yelnats. Our CSI specialist say that it was an in-and-out run, no more than five minutes from breach to clear. The door and safe were both breached non-destructively. Initial response was completed in 8 minutes and found no sign of the thieves or any trace of their presence, and the responding officer cleared the scene as a false alarm after a brief investigation. The goods were reported as stolen three weeks later when the homeowner returned from vacation.""

""Thank you Wexler, that'll be all.""

""Sir?""

""I said that will be all, Wexler.""

""You don't want to go visit anywhere? Beat the information out of a witness?"" Wexler mimed grabbing someone by the collar and punching the air, knocking the half-full cup of coffee out of the detective's hand in the process.

""WEXLER!""

""Oh, I'm so sorry sir. So sorry."" He jumped up out of his chair and came around the desk, but slipped in the expanding puddle of coffee, bowling over the detective as he fell.

The detective pulled himself to his feet, swiping uselessly at the coffee stains on his legs and shirt, and then hauled Wexler off the floor by his vest.

""You're already riding a desk for inappropriate field conduct, Wexler,"" The detective's growl was filled with proper anger now, ""Don't make it worse.""

""Sorry, Boss. Sorry. Anyway, why aren't we digging more into this robbery?""

""We looked into it, and determined it wasn't a robbery.""

Wexler scrunkled his eyebrows as he eased himself back into his char at his desk. ""wasn't a robbery? But they broke into the Mayor's sister's house and stole her money! Why those folk should be getting shot, not left off as 'not robbers'.""

""Not *her* money, though.""

""Not her money? Then who's was it?""

""Those funds were embezzled from the orphanage she runs. it was back in their bank account before we know about the robbery.""

Wexler bolted upright ""well they're still robbers. We oughta -"" his thighs slammed into the desk as he rose, flipping the whole desk over and taking him with it, knocking the detective back over.

""That's IT, Wexler. you're done. Get out.""

Wexler just nodded, head hanging low. *I'll show them* he thought to himself as he limped towards the door. *I'll get those thieves dead to rights if I have to beat down half the city!*

I went home and quickly explore that I only need original json.txt file as well as xxx.dat file and put it in bitcoin core just to validate that those files are connected to that wallet. Normally I started on my home laptop and realize that space and internet connection is not enough to finish this job. So luckily I thought that I have one joker in my life that will never say to me no if I explain to him what problem do I have. It is the calmest and craziest guy I know in my life and can say that he is one of the best Linux admins in my country and maybe abroad and have knowledge from whole internet. I explain to him and he raises his hand to my head and told me stupid one I can solve this in several hours. He has infrastructure to do that just he should have to go to his office. He went home and writes to me that he will need more than several hours to solve this because bitcoin core reading of new blocks even on powerful server is bit slow. However next morning he called me on the phone (almost never call me just write to me) and told me to go to his office to do the transaction. He was very excited that we have solved the problem. He opens the wallet and tries to make transaction to his wallet and here starts the problems. There was a password. We did not have it. PROBLEM. F…. now what. We sat down and think fast that the files are 100% original just we need password. After this we realised that even private key can solve this issue. Ok we move with the job.

Because he do not think like regular programmer he make a quick research and programmed a software in python better than john the ripper and all available password cracker software available online. He downloaded all list we could find (even I helped) and start to crack the password. F… again. After several billions of passwords no luck. Ok we move on. We asked the guy that gives us the files about hint and he told us guys we did not tell you till now because we did not think that you have knowledge and experience to start this kind of job. And he told us that the password is only 12 digits and he knows 7 of them. But in order to give us the 7 letters we need to prove that we have infrastructure to solve it. Ok. My partner told me no worries only 7.3 billions password combinations are available to crack. 10 servers and few days. Ok. We started with 2 servers with 192 cores and 20 laptops. Even guy from other side of the world came in person to give us 7 digits. We started the process. After going ones through 7.3 billion combinations splitted in 72 files across two powerful servers and 20 laptops we did not have luck. F… again. We have pressure to solve this. Ok once gain but only one file and 10 days to go through 7.3 billions of password combinations. No luck again. And we raised hands from this. Original explanation was that there is some mistake in the letters and the guy that was our contact did not answer us why there were some mistakes.

So are there any available other solutions (although my partner is not believing in solution) but reddit is gold for this kind of stuff. Anyone that will give us solution will be awarded accordingly. I have proof of anything and this is not to try some stupid thing but I have this idea that reddit could be the solution  ",0,1767817981.0,Bitcoin,2,0.5,False
1q6qoww,https://www.reddit.com/r/decadeology/comments/1q6qoww/decade_eras_1980spresent_my_version/,Decade eras (1980s-present): My version,"In my opinion, decades are not based solely on calendar years and their chronological placement, but on a shared political and cultural zeitgeist. This is almost why it is always the case that decades are highly fragmented and need to be further divided into eras. In this post, I have chosen to break each decade down into political and cultural aspects, and then further divide each of these into three distinct eras: the early decade, the mid-decade, and the late decade. These are further divided into two eras, the first and second wave, aka. the core and transition part for early and late decade and classic vs modern for mid decade. I have chosen to begin with the early 1980s, as my knowledge of earlier decades is somewhat limited. So let’s dive in and explore.

So this morning I had to perform this action as it died sometime yesterday.  When I plugged it in, it woke up and told me the time was 18:30, so I guess it died at 6 30 last night.

1q6qo2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jl5879/comments/1q6qo2i/husband_and_the_babysitter_and_wife_part_4/,Husband and the babysitter and wife: Part 4,"The next morning, Sarah approached the large dog crate at the foot of their bed with a key in hand, her silk robe loosely tied around her naked form. Emily had barely slept, her body sore from the previous night's degradations, the welts on her skin throbbing faintly under the thin blanket. The click of the padlock echoed in the quiet room as Sarah swung the door open. ""Out, slave,"" she commanded sharply, her voice brooking no delay. Emily crawled out stiffly, her joints aching, naked and marked, blinking against the morning light filtering through the curtains.

""Put on your new clothes,"" Sarah ordered, pointing to a neatly folded pile on the dresser. Emily's hands shook as she dressed: first, the black leather collar, thick and unyielding, with ""SLAVE"" embossed in silver letters across the front—a constant reminder of her status. It buckled snugly around her neck, the D-ring at the front dangling like a promise of restraint. Next came the leather full-body harness, intricate straps crisscrossing her torso, framing her perky breasts and dipping between her legs to accentuate her smooth pussy, adorned with multiple D-rings for attachments. Wrist and ankle cuffs followed, black leather with sturdy metal rings, clicking into place. Finally, sheer fishnet stockings that hugged her legs from thigh to toe, the mesh digging slightly into her skin. Fully attired, Emily looked like a vision of submission—vulnerable, erotic, utterly owned.

She descended the stairs slowly, the harness shifting with each step, the collar a weighty collar around her throat. In the dining room, Sarah and Mark sat side by side at the table, dressed in casual morning attire—Mark in boxers and a t-shirt, Sarah in her robe. Emily's phone lay in Sarah's hand, the screen glowing faintly.

Sarah glanced up with a satisfied smirk. ""Good morning, pet. I took the liberty of texting your parents as you last night. Told them you hate them, cursed them out for being controlling pricks, said you've run away and won't be coming back. Blocked their numbers too."" She slid the phone across the table, showing the sent messages—harsh words Emily would never have uttered, but now etched into permanence. ""No one's looking for you anymore. This way, no one will ever want to. You're erased from your old life.""

Emily's stomach dropped, tears pricking her eyes, but she bit her lip, knowing resistance was futile. Sarah continued, ""Besides sexually pleasing us whenever we demand it, you'll be our housemaid. Clean, cook, serve—whatever we say. Start now: make us coffee. Black for me, cream and sugar for Mark. Bring it here.""

Emily hurried to the kitchen, her fishnet-clad feet padding softly on the tile. She prepared the mugs carefully, the aroma filling the air, then carried them back on a tray, kneeling submissively at their feet to present them.

Sarah took a sip, nodding approval. ""Good. Now, on your knees properly. Open Mark's robe and blow him while he drinks his coffee.""

Emily obeyed, parting Mark's robe to reveal his morning erection, thick and veined. She leaned in, her collared neck brushing his thigh, and took him into her mouth—lips wrapping around the head, tongue swirling tentatively at first, then deeper. Mark groaned softly, sipping his coffee casually as if this were routine.

""As you're sucking him,"" Sarah added nonchalantly, ""open my robe and rub my pussy. Make me feel good while I enjoy my coffee.""

Emily's free hand reached up, parting Sarah's robe to expose her shaved mound. Her fingers found the warm, slick folds, rubbing in slow circles over the clit, dipping inside occasionally. Sarah leaned back in her chair, legs spreading wider, sipping her coffee with a contented sigh. ""That's it, slave. Serve us like the whore you are.""

Emily worked them both rhythmically—bobbing her head on Mark's cock, taking him deeper, gagging softly as she forced more in, her saliva coating him. Her fingers pumped Sarah's pussy, thumb circling the clit. The harness straps dug into her skin with her movements, heightening her awareness of her submission. Mark's breaths grew ragged; Emily sucked harder, deeper, hollowing her cheeks until he tensed and came with a low grunt, flooding her mouth with thick, salty cum. She swallowed instinctively, a forbidden thrill at the taste despite everything.

Sarah set her mug down abruptly, grabbing a fistful of Emily's blonde hair and yanking her face from Mark's softening cock straight into her own dripping pussy. ""I told you he can't cum inside you anymore, and here you are enjoying his load like a greedy slut. That's not allowed."" She ground Emily's face against her mound, smearing wetness. ""Eat me now—and spit his cum out onto my pussy. Use it as lube.""

Emily complied, her anger and hunger mixing in a frenzy. She shoved the remnants of Mark's cum from her mouth onto Sarah's clit, then dove in—tongue lapping hungrily at the folds, sucking the nub, probing deep. Sarah moaned, hips bucking, her grip tightening in Emily's hair. The taste was a humiliating cocktail—Mark's semen mingling with Sarah's juices—but Emily ate angrily, desperately, until Sarah arched and came hard, flooding her mouth with release.

Sarah and Mark finished their coffee leisurely, then rose to dress for work—professional attire for their offices. ""Eat something quick yourself,"" Sarah said dismissively. ""Then clean the entire house. Spotless by the time we get home, or else. Dinner on the table, hot and ready."" Before leaving, she produced a thick butt plug from her pocket, lubed it quickly, and shoved it into Emily's ass with a firm push. Emily gasped at the intrusion, clenching around it. ""Don't take it out. We're preparing you for tonight.""

The door shut behind them, leaving Emily alone. She ate a hasty breakfast, the plug shifting with every movement, a constant pressure that made her pussy throb unwillingly. Cleaning was arduous—the harness and stockings restricting slightly, the collar chafing, the plug rubbing her insides with each bend and stretch. She vacuumed, dusted, scrubbed counters, her body hyper-aware, arousal building shamefully from the fullness.

When Sarah and Mark returned that evening, the house gleamed immaculately, dinner—roast chicken, vegetables, wine—steaming on the table. Sarah inspected briefly, her expression softening almost to niceness. ""Not bad, pet. Almost impressed.""

They sat at opposite ends of the long dining table. ""You can eat too,"" Mark said gruffly, but added, ""Quickly—you have work."" Emily scarfed her plate standing, then Sarah commanded, ""Under the table now. On all fours, ass facing Mark, face toward me.""

Emily crawled beneath, the wood above her head, positioning as ordered. Mark unzipped, his cock hardening as he positioned it at her exposed pussy, the harness framing it perfectly. Sarah hiked her dress, pulling panties aside. ""Eat me and fuck him—rock back and forth like the slutty pendulum you are.""

Emily rocked, impaling herself on Mark's cock while tonguing Sarah's pussy—deep licks, clit suction. Above, they ate dinner casually, chatting about work—Mark's project delays, Sarah's client meetings—mostly ignoring the girl servicing them. Emily's moans were muffled, her body straining in the confined space, the plug amplifying every thrust.

Dinner finished, Sarah yanked Emily out by the leash clipped to her collar, leading her to the living room like a dog. Sarah's eyes narrowed at a faint stain on the carpet. ""What is that?"" she yelled.

""I... spilled a drink earlier,"" Emily stammered. ""It wouldn't come out completely.""

Fury ignited Sarah's face. She threw Emily to the floor, shoving her face into the carpet, fist in hair grinding her down. ""You disobedient bitch!""

Sarah's palm came down like thunder on Emily's exposed ass, the first smack echoing through the room like a gunshot, the fishnet stockings offering no protection as her flesh jiggled and reddened instantly under the force. Emily yelped, her cheek pressed hard into the rough carpet fibers, which scraped her skin raw with each grind of Sarah's grip in her hair. Another blow landed on the back of her thigh, the sting blooming into a deep burn that made her legs kick involuntarily, her harness straps digging into her hips as she squirmed. Sarah didn't stop—rain after rain of open-handed slaps assaulted her ass and thighs, turning the pale skin a mottled crimson, welts rising in angry ridges that throbbed with her racing heartbeat. Each impact sent shockwaves through her body, the butt plug shifting deeper inside her ass, pressing against her inner walls in a way that blurred pain and unwelcome arousal. Emily sobbed openly, tears soaking the carpet beneath her face, her freckled cheeks flushed with humiliation as snot dripped from her nose.

Not content with just spanking, Sarah's free hand snaked between Emily's trembling thighs, fingers roughly parting her slick pussy lips—already traitorously wet from the day's constant stimulation. She plunged two fingers inside without warning, the intrusion brutal and deep, curling them to hook against Emily's G-spot as she thrust in and out with punishing speed. Emily's walls clenched around the digits, juices coating Sarah's hand in glistening strings, the wet squelching sounds obscene in the quiet room. ""You think you can defy me?"" Sarah growled, adding a third finger to stretch her wider, pumping harder, her nails scraping lightly against sensitive flesh. Emily's hips bucked despite herself, a strangled moan escaping as pleasure coiled tight amid the agony.

Sarah hauled her up roughly by the hair, spinning her around and grabbing her throat from behind with one vise-like hand, squeezing just enough to make Emily's breath hitch, her collared neck straining against the leather. With her other hand, Sarah yanked out the butt plug in one swift pull, eliciting a sharp cry from Emily as her ass gaped momentarily, empty and aching. Then, without lube or mercy, Sarah shoved a single finger deep into the puckered hole, twisting it roughly, the dry friction burning as she probed and scissored. ""I told you to have the house spotless!"" Sarah hissed, her breath hot against Emily's ear. ""You've made it dirtier with your incompetence. I won't tolerate disobedience—not from a worthless cum rag like you."" Emily whimpered, her body arching, toes curling in her fishnets as the finger invaded deeper, hooking inside to press against nerves that sent conflicting sparks through her core.

Releasing her throat, Sarah pushed Emily back down onto the floor, flat on her back, the carpet rough against her welted skin. Sarah straddled her face in a reverse position, lowering her bare ass and pussy onto Emily's mouth with deliberate slowness, grinding down until her full weight smothered the girl. Emily's nose was buried in Sarah's crack, inhaling the musky scent as Sarah rubbed her dripping pussy and tight asshole back and forth across her lips, tongue, and nose—smearing sticky arousal in thick trails, coating her freckled face in glistening fluids. Emily gasped for air in stolen moments, her tongue forced to lap desperately at whatever was presented, tasting the salty tang of Sarah's excitement mixed with her own humiliation.

Grabbing the leather flogger from the nearby box, Sarah swung it with vicious precision, the suede tails cracking against Emily's exposed breasts first—the impact making her perky tits bounce and redden, nipples hardening painfully under the assault. Welts crisscrossed her pale skin, each lash drawing a muffled scream from beneath Sarah's grinding hips. The flogger moved lower, whipping her flat stomach, the strikes leaving red stripes that burned like fire, her abs contracting involuntarily. Then to her pussy—sharp cracks against the sensitive folds, the tails stinging her clit and lips, making her thighs clench and her juices flow even more copiously. Finally, the thighs, already sore from earlier spanks, now lashed until they glowed crimson, the fishnets tearing slightly under the force. ""Apologize, you filthy slut!"" Sarah demanded, her voice a whip itself.

Emily tried to cry out apologies, her words garbled and muffled by Sarah's smothering cheeks and slick pussy lips, vibrations from her pleas only heightening Sarah's pleasure. Sarah lifted her ass just enough for Emily to gasp air and speak, her face slick and shiny. ""I'm sorry... please, I'm so sorry..."" Emily sobbed, voice breaking.

Sarah's eyes gleamed with dark satisfaction. ""You'll be sorry when we're through with you."" She called over her shoulder, ""Mark, get over here. Mount this bitch and fuck her pussy—hard and deep, no holding back.""

Mark approached, shedding his clothes quickly, his cock already throbbing hard from watching the scene. He knelt between Emily's spread legs, gripping her harness for leverage, and slammed into her sopping pussy in one brutal thrust, burying himself to the hilt. Emily arched with a wail, her walls stretching around his thickness, the intrusion amplified by the day's teasing. He pounded relentlessly—deep, forceful strokes that made her breasts jiggle with each impact, his balls slapping wetly against her ass. Sarah leaned back on her hands for balance, her pussy hovering just above Emily's mouth, allowing the girl to tongue her butthole deeply—probing the tight ring, circling and sucking as ordered. Meanwhile, Mark leaned forward, his tongue lapping at Sarah's exposed pussy, flicking her clit and delving into her folds while he fucked Emily below.

Emily's body betrayed her utterly, pleasure building like a storm despite the degradation. She came hard mid-thrust, her pussy clenching rhythmically around Mark's cock, legs shaking uncontrollably, juices squirting in small gushes that soaked his shaft and dripped onto the carpet. But she didn't stop—her tongue continued rimming Sarah's ass through the waves, the overstimulation making her whimper and twitch.

Sarah threw her head back, moaning loudly as her own orgasm built from Mark's tongue and Emily's efforts, her body shuddering as she came, grinding down harder to flood Emily's face anew. But then she felt a shift—the air changed—and she looked down to see Mark and Emily's eyes locked in a moment of unintended connection? No—worse: Mark had paused slightly, his lips brushing Sarah's thigh, but his gaze was soft on Emily. Rage exploded in Sarah; she snatched the flogger and whipped Mark's back sharply, the tails cracking against his skin and leaving red marks. ""Stop that! She's not yours to pity or kiss—you fuck her like the toy she is!""

They disentangled quickly, Mark pulling out with a wet pop, his cock glistening. Emily lay spent on the floor, panting, her body a map of welts and fluids. Sarah, still buzzing from her climax, retrieved a large vibrating dildo—thick, veined, with powerful motors—and a matching vibrating butt plug from the box. She coated them roughly with lube from Emily's own pussy juices, then shoved the dildo deep into the girl's sopping cunt, twisting it until it seated fully, the ridges dragging against her oversensitive walls. Emily gasped, hips bucking as Sarah turned it on high, the vibrations humming through her core like an earthquake. Next, the butt plug—wider than the previous one—rammed into her ass, stretching the ring painfully before popping in, its buzz syncing with the dildo to create a relentless dual assault that made Emily's toes curl and her clit throb visibly.

Using the D-rings on Emily's cuffs, Sarah linked her wrists and ankles together with short chains, hoisting her legs up and back until her knees nearly touched her shoulders, exposing her stuffed holes completely, her body folded in a vulnerable, immobilizing position on her back. The toys buzzed mercilessly inside her, building another orgasm already.

For the final humiliation, Sarah orchestrated the positions carefully. Mark knelt above Emily's head, his balls and ass hovering directly over her mouth, the musky scent filling her nostrils. Sarah lay on her back perpendicular, her legs spread wide, her crotch positioned just over the top of Emily's forehead, her pussy inches from the girl's hairline. Mark entered Sarah slowly at first, then with building rhythm—thrusting deep into her wet heat, his body rocking back and forth. Emily's tongue was forced into action: lapping at his heavy balls as they swung forward, sucking them gently, then darting up to rim his ass on the backstroke, her tongue sliding along the perineum and occasionally brushing the base of his shaft where it plunged into Sarah. The motion was hypnotic, degrading—Emily's face a mere accessory to their fucking.

Sarah's pussy juices and Mark's precum dripped copiously from their union, splattering into Emily's blonde hair, matting it in sticky, messy strands that clung to her forehead and temples. The scent was overwhelming—salty, musky, arousal-thick—mixing with the vibrations tearing through her own body. Emily burned with disgust and humiliation, her cheeks flaming as she tasted the intimate flavors of their coupling, ashamed that this had become her life: reduced to a living sex toy, saddened by how the man she once loved now treated her with such casual cruelty. Yet, beneath the shame, arousal surged uncontrollably—the freedom of having no choice, the complete submission to her masters intoxicating her. She orgasmed hard in relentless waves, her pussy and ass clenching around the buzzing toys, juices squirting in arcs that soaked her thighs and the carpet below, her muffled moans vibrating against Mark's skin.

Mark's thrusts grew erratic, his groans deepening. Suddenly, he pulled out of Sarah, pivoting slightly to shove his slick cock—all coated in her juices—straight down Emily's throat. He put his full weight on her head, hands pinning either side of her face to the floor, forcing every inch past her lips deep into her throat. Emily choked violently, gagging as the thick shaft blocked her airway, her throat convulsing around him in desperate spasms. Lightheadedness set in quickly, stars dancing in her vision, her body squirming futilely against the cuffs, chains rattling as she strained, the vibrating toys amplifying the sensory overload into a dizzying haze. Panic rose, but so did a twisted thrill; she felt utterly owned, broken.

Finally, Mark came with a guttural roar, flooding her throat deep with hot, thick ropes of cum that she swallowed desperately amid her choking, some bubbling back up through her nose in messy strands. He held there for agonizing seconds, then pulled out quickly. Emily coughed and gagged explosively, spitting up loads of cum that dribbled from her mouth and nose, mixing with tears and saliva on her chin, her chest heaving as she gasped for air.

Sarah laughed cruelly, watching the spectacle. ""I said before that Mark isn't allowed to cum in you anymore, but throats seem like a good exception—deep enough to choke on your punishment.""

Exhausted and wrecked, Emily was told to go clean up and get ready for bed in her cage. She stumbled to the bathroom, scrubbing the sticky mess from her face and hair under scalding water, her body still buzzing faintly from the toys she'd removed. Back in the bedroom, she crawled into the crate, curling up tightly, her legs shaking and the heat between her thighs a persistent ache. Apprehension and curiosity swirled in her mind—what horrors or twisted pleasures awaited tomorrow? As she drifted toward uneasy sleep, she heard Sarah and Mark in bed above, their voices low and intimate, whispering their plans for her—dark promises of more degradation, more breaking, more ways to use their new pet.",1,1767817690.0,u_jl5879,0,1.0,False

Too early to think about capital?,"I’ve been quietly building a consumer brand over the past few months and wanted perspective from people who’ve actually done this in India.

The idea is content-first and community-led, with a physical product as the entry point (specialty coffee, but designed for Indian milk based flavours). Long-term, it’s meant to be a broader lifestyle ecosystem rather than just a single SKU D2C play of coffee.

What’s done so far:

* Brand, packaging, and supply side locked
* Website live and indexed
* Consistent organic traction across on Instagram (no heavy paid spend)
* Early UGC and creator-led awareness
* First limited sales expected to go live in **February** as a proof of concept

What I’m unsure about:

* Is it better to wait until there’s 2–3 years of real sales before even *thinking* about capital?
* Or does it make sense to start conversations early, even if it’s just feedback and relationship-building?
* For consumer brands in India, what mattered more early on: traction, repeat behaviour, or clarity of long-term vision?

Not pitching. Not fundraising here.

Genuinely trying to understand timing and expectations from people who’ve built or invested in consumer businesses in India.

I've been on break these past few weeks, which has given me ample time to cross off some movies from my loooong list. I wanted to take a minute to highlight some of the films I saw, but I also want you guys to share any recent films you've seen, as well as some films you are trying to watch in this new year. 

Anyways, this past week, my list of movies has been hefty. In order, we have:

- The Zone of Interest
- The Abyss
- The Coffee Table
- Soft & Quiet
- Green Room
- Funny Games (1997, of course)
- Taxi Driver

If you are a horror fan, and spend some time over on the horror subreddit, you may recognize a few of these. If you have seen any of them, join me to discuss more in depth in the comments :)

A lot of these movies I went into completely blind (which, tbh, is how I think most movies should be watched), and I was quite pleasantly surprised by all of them. 

I think my favourite movie of the bunch was The Coffee Table, just because I felt like it was really well executed for what it was, and I felt like it did a great job of putting me into the shoes of the main character. I think it may be tied for first place with The Abyss, however, just because that movie had lots of suspense, adventure, intrigue, and beauty. Usually horror tends to be my favourite, but The Abyss was amazing all around. 

I think my least favourite was Soft & Quiet, because although I did appreciate the subject matter it touched on, and the message it was trying to send, I don't think it was that great of an actual movie. 

I think the one that left me with the most uncomfortable feelings for the longest was Funny Games, and I can't really explain why without spoiling it, but I really liked how it was executed. 

The other three, The Zone of Interest, Taxi Driver, and Green Room all held their own, and were each fantastic in their own ways. 

If anyone here has seen any of these, I would love to know your thoughts, and to share mine more in depth! Feel free to also share some things you have watched recently, or things that you plan on watching soon!!

My wife immigrated from Eastern Europe a few years ago, and socially it’s been a real struggle for her here.

She’s highly educated, childfree, and non-religious. Back home she was a veterinarian and is now working toward licensure in the U.S. The issue isn’t language. It’s cultural fit.

Most social interaction she encounters here revolves around kids, church, or heavy drinking. She doesn’t dislike kids and doesn’t judge anyone’s choices, but when those are the only topics, it becomes isolating. She also doesn’t drink, which further narrows social options.

She’s experienced a lot of condescension. People talking to her slowly, oversimplifying things, or not engaging her as a peer. Immigrant communities have been kinder, but they tend to be insular, often language-specific, and heavily centered around young families.

What she really needs isn’t a big friend group. Just one or two friends who enjoy meeting for coffee, talking about life, work, ideas, etc. Adult, peer-level friendships that aren’t defined by kids or religion.

We’re trying to figure out whether this is a Nashville/South issue or if this is just what most of the U.S. is like socially for childfree immigrants. Our biggest fear is going through the effort of moving and finding the same dynamics elsewhere.

Are there regions or specific towns in the U.S. where this kind of social environment is more common? Especially places that are more welcoming to educated immigrants and where childfree adults aren’t treated as outliers.",9,1767817189.0,relocating,15,0.85,False

My and my partner have been doing therapy, and nothing is changing. Whatever needs I have, they're seem to be too much. They take my talking about relationship dynamics that I think need work into personal insults.

Every time we argue, I end up thinking I'm the asshole. I'm the one asking too much. I've been suppressing my feelings, accepting not having a sex life, accepting only communicating affections on their terms, I feel like I've been trying so hard to be accomodating, and I feel so fucking alone.

No shoulder to cry on. No one to give me advice, to support me. Living life on my own.

I've had something happen a while back that was eating at me. I basically don't even tell them about my inner world anymore, and they never talk about theirs. But I needed to talk about it, so I did. The reply? ""Well, figure it out.""

I feel so fucking alone. But i love my partner so much. Or I think. I don't understand my emotions anymore. Is it love? is it me being afraid to be alone? is it sunk cost fallacy? Just thinking about breaking up shreads my heart into a million pieces.

Sometimes, everything is nice. Sometimes they even look for me, and are affectionate. But then they withdraw, or I have some (what I think are) basic emotional needs and I feel horrible all over again. and it never ends. I shower them with praise, compliments, look after them, make them coffee, clean after them, offer emotional support all the fucking time and it feels like it's just making things worse. but this is who I am, am I supposed to not love anymore? I give them compliments because I feel that shit every time I look at them. I feel like i'm making things worse by just being myself. It sometimes feels like I need to be lobotomised to work in this relationship.

Can somebody relate? Am I insane?  I know I am often wrong. I just want to love and feel loved.

Hi moms. This is a long one, sorry in advance for the ramble. I’ve been sitting on this for a while and finally decided to just post it because I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind and don’t know what’s normal anymore.

I’m a mom of three kids. My son is 3, and I also have 8 month old twin girls. I stay at home during the weekdays, and then on the weekends, I work on call as a healthcare provider in a job that’s mentally demanding and doesn’t really turn off.. until Monday morning when it’s back to being a SAHM again. I’m home all day with kids, but my brain is still “on” constantly. It feels like I’m doing two full-time jobs at the same time and failing both.

I’m exhausted in a way that feels bone deep. Not just tired. Like… my fuse is gone. I miss my old self. I miss my creativity, my body, my passion. I can’t explain it, but they’re just days where I feel completely lost in a fog. Zoloft helped me with my PPD after my first son, and I am still on it, but now I feel like I’m just in the fucking trenches and there’s no way out.

My son is SO sweet and funny, the ultimate character. I’m tearing up as I type this! But right now he is so incredibly demanding. He wants the TV changed every two seconds. He follows me everywhere and wants me constantly for every little thing. I try to accommodate, I also try to establish boundaries, but it’s so fucking hard and I have such a short fuse because I’m also managing the twins babies. Sometimes I just want to drink my coffee and rot on the couch for five minutes without someone needing something from me.

And instead of handling it calmly, I snap. I yell. I get irritated fast. I lash out. I wouldn’t dare hurt my kids ever, but I feel like I feel like I’m “not nice” a lot of the time, and that thought alone wrecks me. My friends say that I’m way too hard on myself and that I’m superwoman, but I feel like they’re just blowing smoke up my ass.

The worst part is that my son seems to get over it quickly. He’s so happy again, goofy, shaking his imaginary tail like nothing happened. And I’m sitting there thinking, what the hell am I doing to my kid?

I’m constantly apologizing. Over and over. “Mommy shouldn’t have yelled. Mommy is so sorry. Mommy was just overwhelmed and upset “ And I keep wondering… what good is an apology if I keep doing it?

My mom lashed out at me the other day and said I ought to be grateful, that my children are beautiful and healthy. And I am fucking grateful! But being grateful and being overwhelmed and frustrated are entities that are allowed to coexist… right???

The twins obviously need nonstop care, and I can’t physically meet everyone’s needs at once. It feels like no matter what I choose, someone loses. That constant feeling of being pulled in three directions is making me angry and overstimulated in a way I don’t recognize.

My marriage isn’t terrible, but it’s strained. The mental load, the emotional labor, the day-to-day kid stuff mostly falls on me. The responsibilities of the household are in my hands. I feel like delegating things takes even more time and effort, and at the end of the day, it’s just easier if I fucking handle it. My husband does do chores, he vacuums, does laundry, but I still feel like I’m fucking drowning. Even when my husband helps, I don’t feel like I ever truly get to shut off. I don’t feel like I get a real break. Not to mention that we are on such different wavelengths in terms of our level languages and he is emotionally constipated, but anyway! That’s another loaded Reddit post…

What scares me the most is that I grew up in a very hostile and volatile home. My dad had the worst temper and was verbally abusive to my mom. And my mom was both physically and verbally abusive to me during my childhood, the byproducts of fucked up, generational trauma married to Third World country instability. 

I’ve lately heard my own voice coming out sharper than I want it to be, and I think Jesus, I am perpetuating the fucking cycle.  I don’t want my kids to remember me as a monster. My husband says that I am a great mom, but I just don’t fucking feel it. I feel like it’s a farce.

I love my kids so fucking much. Like, it physically hurts. And somehow that makes the guilt worse.

I don’t know if I need therapy, anger management, or just actual rest. I don’t know if other moms would be this way in my position or if I’m just extra irritable and failing at this. I feel lazy and awful for even wanting space, even though I know logically that I’m burnt out.

I guess I’m posting because I need to know if this is normal. If other moms feel this angry and overstimulated. If this phase passes. If apologizing and trying still counts for something.

I’m not looking for perfection or “enjoy every moment” advice. I just really need to know I’m not alone, and that this doesn’t mean I’m a horrible mom.

If you’ve been here or gotten through this, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.






TL;DR: 
3 kids (toddler + twin babies), no real breaks, burnt out as fuck. I’m yelling more than I want to, feeling guilty nonstop, and terrified I’m messing this shit up. Please tell me this doesn’t mean I’m a terrible mom. ",5,1767816968.0,Mommit,10,1.0,False

1q6qb2m,https://i.redd.it/obtx2466jzbg1.png,Luna's Butterfly Tattoo,"Five springs had passed since I terminated the mate bond with Alpha Landon Ashford when we met again in a tattoo studio.



He was there to touch up the name of his mate across his chest.



I was there to cover the old scars on my wrist.



Years had slipped by, and for a long moment, we simply stood there, wordless, looking at each other.



Just as Landon broke the silence and was about to speak, the hem of his shirt was tugged by a small hand.



""Daddy."" The little boy stared at me curiously, ""Who is she?""



…



The island breeze stirred the wind chimes hanging outside the porch, breaking the long, heavy quiet.



""I'm a customer,"" I said, ""Same as your dad. Just here for a tattoo.""



The boy tilted his head, ""Do you know my dad?""



""Marcus!"" Landon's tone sharpened, and the boy pouted, falling quiet.



""Nope,"" I answered anyway, ""We're strangers.""



Landon's expression darkened.



The shop owner tapped the counter, glancing between us. ""Who's first?""



Landon had been leaning against the bar, but now he straightened, his eyes fixed on me. ""She goes.""



He wore an off-white linen shirt tucked into silver-gray slacks, the top buttons undone, revealing the defined lines of his chest.



Over his left pec was a tattoo, partly obscured, but I knew exactly whose name it was.



Even when we terminated our mate bond, that name had not yet been inked over Landon's heart.



""First come, first served."" My voice was polite, distant. ""Please, after you.""



Before Landon could respond, his phone vibrated. By chance, I caught a glimpse of the screen: Sweetheart.



The screen went dark as he immediately pressed it, and he looked straight at me. I turned away and walked toward the lounge booth.



Behind me came the excited voice of the boy, ""Was that Mommy calling?""



Landon's reply came low and cool, the way he always sounded when he was trying to soothe someone.



His voice blended with the cello music humming softly through the studio.



I stirred my coffee without looking up until a small, timid ""Ma'am"" sounded beside me.



I turned. The little boy from earlier was leaning over the armrest, peering at me.



He was delicate and pretty in a soft, bookish way, impossibly cute.



Cute enough that even knowing who his father was, I couldn't bring myself to feel any resentment.



""You know,"" he whispered as if sharing a secret, ""you look a lot like my mom. She's a beautiful superstar.""



""Then you must look like her, too.""



His eyes lit up instantly, and he leaned forward as if wanting to get closer, but a large hand pressed down gently on his head.



Landon patted him lightly. ""Go wait in the car with Mr. Vaelen.""



I lifted a brow. Turning, I saw the middle-aged man who had followed Landon for years.



Our eyes met. Shock washed over his face, mixed with something faintly embarrassed. ""Miss Sinclair…""



I nodded calmly. He was Landon's most trusted beta, and we had crossed paths many times before.



Landon scooped the boy into his arms. As he rose, a glint of gold flickered at his wrist.



His watch. A Patek Philippe. A model he never would have chosen back then.



On his long ring finger was a plain band, understated yet impossibly expensive.



During the two years Landon and I were bonded, he never wore a bonding ring.



So this was what it felt like to marry a destined mate.



I took a sip of my coffee, realizing it was a feeling that didn't fade with time.



Chapter 2

The boy left with the beta, but Landon still stood in front of my booth.



""Hazel,"" he said, ""How have you been these years?""



My coffee was half-finished. I set the cup down. ""Pretty well, thanks for asking.""



After a moment of silence, the shadow over my head shifted and disappeared as Landon followed the owner upstairs.



The cello faded into a softer piano piece, calm and slow, almost matching the quiet in my chest.



The owner of the studio was a world-renowned tattoo artist whose hand-drawn designs were nearly impossible to book. He only took two clients a day.



And today, of all days, we ended up here together.



My gaze drifted over the designs on the wall before pausing at the one displayed in the center.



It showed a red-lip tattoo on the inside of a man's thigh.



The man sat on the floor with one knee raised, wearing a robe with black boxer briefs beneath it. A faint pink lip print marked the fabric suggestively.



The shape of the lips was perfect, the lines clean, carrying a restrained heat against bronze skin.



A woman had left that mark on a man's body.



""Miss Sinclair."" The owner's voice pulled me back. ""This way, please.""



I turned and saw Landon coming down the spiral staircase, his shirt buttoned all the way to the top.



""So fast?"" I asked.



""He got weird about it—changed his mind about the touch-up,"" the owner said casually, clearly familiar with Landon. ""You can head up to the second floor.""



Landon stopped at the foot of the stairs, one hand in his pocket, his expression unreadable.



From above, he looked down at me with eyes that pressed hard.



We stared in silence, and what surfaced in my mind was our last time together in bed.



Right after kissing, before he moved over me, I had seen the red-lip tattoo on the inside of his thigh.



The clock on the wall chimed. I picked up my bag and walked toward the stairs.



As I passed him, his hand closed hard around my wrist. The metal of his watch pressed into my skin, sharp enough to hurt.



""Hazel,"" his voice dropped low and hoarse, ""do you really have to pretend we're strangers?""



I didn't struggle, meeting his gaze without a flicker of emotion. ""Being able to pretend we're strangers at all is me showing you respect.""



His grip paused. He let go and brushed his thumb along his fingers, his tone softening. ""I know you still hate me.""



Landon always had this ability; no matter the situation, he held the upper hand. He was never the one who felt awkward.



Just like back then, when photos of him kissing Helena Frost made the entertainment headlines, he had looked at me with the same composed demeanor.



Only back then, I was hysterical. In the face of my mate's cold detachment, I had turned into a crazed mess



""You're overstating it."" I took a few steps up the stairs, my tone detached. ""Given what we are now, 'hate' doesn't even come into it.""



Landon seemed ready to speak again, but I didn't care to hear it. I turned and went upstairs.



The studio's interior had a distinct style, post-modern, airy, quiet.



The owner sat at a computer confirming my tattoo design. An assistant prepped the equipment while I removed the watch from my right wrist.



The leather strap, intricately designed, unwound in three loops before it came off.



Beneath it, stark and angry against the skin, lay the faded scars on my wrist.



""The wrist is a sensitive spot,"" the owner said casually, used to sights like this. ""Prepare yourself.""



I smiled. ""It shouldn't hurt more than when I slit it.""



Two scars, one deeper than the other.



Once the numbing time was up, the owner showed me the design one last time before applying it.



A blue butterfly mid-flight, sharp and clean.



""This area is delicate. You'll need another touch-up later,"" he said as he put on a mask. ""But I can guarantee the scar will be completely covered.""



""Do all tattoos need touch-ups?""



""No. Landon just has tricky skin,"" the owner said frankly, not hiding their acquaintance. ""Tattooing him is honestly bad for my reputation.""



I didn't respond. After two years as Landon's mate, of course I knew about his unique skin.



He used to dislike it when I left marks on him during intimacy.



Now, even though it meant constant touch-ups, he still had Helena Frost's name tattooed across his chest.



And Helena's kiss inked inside his thigh.



The first stroke touched the skin of my wrist, and I couldn't help frowning from the sting.



The owner suddenly said, ""Tell me about your scars.""



I paused, then laughed softly. ""Since when do tattoo artists have that hobby?""



In the public view these days, Landon was considered the perfect success story.



In his career, he expanded his territory at the perfect moment and climbed higher and higher.



In love, he was known to be deeply devoted to a rising star, his family picture-perfect.



""I met Landon after he had already bonded with Helena,"" the owner said. ""And Helena looks very much like you.""



I gave a faint smile and took out a pack of cigarettes. ""Mind?""



He shook his head. I exhaled a thin stream of smoke, thought for a moment, and said quietly,



""I'm Landon's ex-mate.""



Chapter 3

Landon and I met in college.



He was my senior in the same major, and when he started his company, he recruited me.



DeepTech was now considered an industry leader, but in the beginning, it was just the two of us.



Landon had extremely high standards. He was a star on campus, and when he put out hiring notices, piles of résumés came in.



""But the only one he kept was me.""



Smoke drifted upward as I narrowed my eyes slightly. ""Back then, Landon was incredibly arrogant—thought he was above everyone. I was the last interviewee that day.""



Neither of us had held much hope. I thought he carried himself with too much cold pride; he, after a full day of interviews, seemed convinced everyone was a fool, including me.



""But that night, we talked until morning. Right when the sun was about to rise, he held out his hand and said, 'Welcome aboard.'""



""Our ideas aligned. Our ambitions matched. Landon had a big appetite for success."" I flicked the ash from my cigarette. ""And coincidentally, so did I.""



In those first two years of DeepTech, Landon and I rented an apartment off-campus.



We pitched to clients together, hunted down investors together.



Landon was my mentor. He taught me everything, professional knowledge, negotiation, relationships, all without reservation.



On my twenty-second birthday, we pulled an all-nighter writing code.



At dawn, he leaned against the window and lit a cigarette.



""He asked me,"" I inhaled softly, ""if I knew how to smoke.""



I leaned in out of curiosity, choked immediately, my eyes watering.



Landon laughed, pulled me into his chest, and kissed me.



When the kiss ended, he asked me if I wanted to bond with him.



The machine paused on my skin for a moment. The owner said, ""Shouldn't he have asked if you wanted to be his girlfriend first?""



I chuckled too, as if telling someone else's story, watching it from a safe distance.



""I said yes, and on that same day, we received our first investment.""



""Riding the wave of AI, DeepTech soared. In just a year, it made a name for itself.""



""On the day DeepTech's core team was formed, I was appointed CEO. That's when Landon took me back to his pack.""



""That was when I learned he was the Alpha heir to the Moonridge Pack.""



Moonridge Pack's territory spread along the coast. Their fortune began in shipping, and after three generations of Alphas, they had become one of the strongest packs in the northern region.



Naturally, our mate bond faced opposition. But since Landon had the courage to break away from the pack, he wasn't about to let anyone dictate his choice of mate.



""Landon fought for two years. He was stubborn enough to be beaten into the pack hospital by the former Alpha. The elders tried to stop him in every possible way, but he never backed down.""



Ash dropped quietly from my cigarette. I watched it for a moment before speaking softly. ""When DeepTech secured its first round of financing, he and I sealed our mate bond.""



""Our mating ceremony was simple, held on an island on the East Coast. Later, Landon bought it under my name and called it Butterfly Island.""



I had loved butterflies since I was young. I collected butterfly specimens of all kinds.



On the day of our mating ceremony, Landon released one hundred thousand butterflies on the island. That was how the island got its name.



The owner's hand stopped moving completely. I nodded. ""It's the island we're standing on now.""



""Before the marriage, Landon signed an agreement. Apart from my original founding shares in DeepTech, he transferred every liquid asset he could move into a trust for me.""



""He said he wanted DeepTech to be my greatest support.""



""Back then, everyone believed Landon was madly in love with me. With assets tied together so tightly, he left no exit for terminating our mate bond.""



""I believed it too."" The cigarette had burned halfway. I crushed it in the ashtray.



""Until the first year after our marriage, when he personally selected Helena to be DeepTech's brand ambassador.""



I had asked Landon why he chose a D-list actress.



""Don't you think,"" Landon pointed at Helena's giant billboard at the time, ""she looks a lot like you did in college?""



""Captures about eighty percent of your spirit,"" he added with a light laugh before I could respond, ""but empty-headed. A complete airhead.""



""Helena shot to fame fast."" The owner's voice pulled me from the memory. ""If I remember correctly, she became famous at nineteen.""



""Yes."" Something flickered in my mind. ""Within a year of becoming our ambassador, she was known all across the States.""",2,1767816883.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
