1mlyzux,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mlyzux/adhd_wrecked_my_focus_my_sleep_and_now_its/,"ADHD wrecked my focus, my sleep, and now it’s starting to wreck my body too","ADHD has completely derailed my life. I used to be a graphic designer, until I realized I simply couldn’t function in a normal office environment anymore. I couldn’t sit still, couldn’t finish a thought, couldn’t stop zoning out. Eventually I quit and became a freelance videographer. 

At first, I loved it. I was filming street interviews for my friend, working from home or out on location, I had ""freedom."" But it turns out, my ADHD brain sees freedom as a trap.

Now every day feels like an endless loop of chaos. I work late, because my time blindness always tricks me into thinking I have plenty of time. I crawl into bed at 2 or 3AM, but my brain won’t stop. My thoughts are darting in every direction.  And my job requires me to constantly scroll for new video ideas, trying to stay sharp, but the fragmented content just feeds the chaos.

I drink way too much coffee to stay awake during the day. Then at night, I’m wide awake — too wired to sleep, too burnt out to work. My appetite is a mess. I’ll go a whole day without eating and then binge at 11PM. I can feel my body starting to break down.

My doctor gave me Adderall. It helps me focus, but it’s making the insomnia worse. I’m stuck in this awful loop of being productive during the day and absolutely wrecked at night. I’ve been reading about Attention Restoration Theory and Conditioned Restoration Theory — about regulating nervous system responses, about how people like me need help transitioning from stimulation to stillness.

So now I always turn to some moving dim lights to calm my mind. Only in this kind of immersive environment (ambient lighting)can my thoughts be slightly stabilized, and I can return to being a normal person and fall asleep.

A bit about me. I majored in the arts, and dabbled a bit in creative writing and photography. I loooove making art though, but I’ve gotten burnt out lately. Just to let you guys know, I am goth and poly. With that, I do have 2 boyfriends and I’m not really looking for anything. I’m also queer and non-binary. 

The kind of stuff I used to do was OC stuff and roleplay inspired ones. 

Gonna be super honest. If we don’t share similar hobbies I really will lose interest. Sorry about that. 

Big passion is creating art and writing roleplays or character backstories sometimes. 

FFXIV and the island sanctuary take up my free time sometimes when I’m home. Otherwise I’m just kind of staring at my screen or trying to figure out how to make more til, lol. I love watching like 18th century cooking stuff or arts and craft stuff. I also like going through weird deep dive stuff and sometimes it’s true crime related or urban exploration. 

I love national parks, museums, botanical gardens, coffee shops, going to cons, uuuhhh other stuff that will come up. Oh oh collecting little trinkets. Gundam kits, blind box stuff, having alone time. 

If any of that sounds fun uhh, yeah lol. 

Looking for friends close to my age if not a little older.

1mlyy0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlyy0l,Overestimation of Dawi knows no bounds! What other factions are heavily overestimated in your opinion?,"Fought on VH/VH

Dont get me wrong, Dawi Faction is uber strong, but the AR for them is the most ridicilous i've seen (Tamurkhan is very close, but he indeed is a fucking menace in battle also).

Meanwhile Chorfs also have really strong AR, but they're not in the league of Dawi, at least not with Hobgoblins in the army.

First 2 Pictures is my Convoy getting intercepted by a popup battle.

Literally put my army in a line, told my units what to go after and then made myself a coffee, didnt even bother with running them down as they're just a popup battle.

Last 2 Pictures is the army you see with Drazhoath and the second army consists of an emergency army with 1 overseer, 3 orc labourers and 12 hobgoblin archers.

Dont ask me why some of the troops did 0 kills (they also did 0 dmg).

I positioned them uphill with enough room to shoot over my troops, but they seemingly didnt want to do anything at all xD

Thunderblusses etc did just fine with the same positioning.

So what factions would you say got similar ridicilous AR with basic armies?",2,1754770137.0,totalwar,2,1.0,False
1mlyxph,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1mlyxph/this_world_is_impossible/,This World is Impossible,"I recovered some of my old arguments for impossible world, viz., for the view that the actual world is an impossible world. 


Possible worlds are states of affairs that are composable. Impossible worlds are noncomposable states of affairs. Composable facts are facts that can be co-instantiated. Any two facts that can be co-instantiated are compossible. For two facts to be compossible, they must remain invariant under the shift of perspectives. Take two agents, A and B. A and B's are conscious creatures. Their first-person facts are not compossible. What this means is that these two facts cannot be co-instantiated as first-person facts. What is a first-person fact for A isn't a first-person fact for B, and vice-versa. That the Saturn is right there is a fact that remains invariant under the shift of perspectives.

Coherence thesis states that the world is not constituted by incompatible facts, i.e., the actual world contains only compossible facts; and since any two compatible facts are compossible, if coherence thesis is true of our world, then our world is a possible world.

There are two assumptions I'm making:

*A1)* Absolutism: the constitution of the world is absolute, viz., not relative to perspectives.

*A2)* Perspectival Relativism(or Neutralism): no first-person perspective is priviledged.

Let's go,

*1)* If the actual world is a possible world, then all facts of our world are composable.

*2)* If all facts of our world are composable, then all facts of our world are compossible. 

*3)* But first-person facts are facts of our world,

Therefore,

*4)* The actual world is an impossible world.

Therefore,

*5)* Coherence thesis is false of our world.


We can either kick out or suppress composability and stick to mere compossibility.

*1)* If the actual world is a possible world, then all facts of our world are compossible. 

*2)* But first person facts aren't compossible,

Therefore,

*3)* The actual world is an impossible world. 


Another one,

*1)* If any two first-person facts are incompossible, then no possible world contains multitude of conscious beings.

*2)* Any two first-person facts are incompossible

*3)* No possible world contains multitude of conscious beings.

*4)* If the actual world is a possible world, then solipsism is true.

*5)* Solipsism is false

*6)* The actual world is an impossible world.



Let me quickly fill in some details, in order to avoid redditor's regular quibble that typically lead absolutely nowhere.  

Composable facts are facts that can be assembled into a coherent (total)state of affairs. Compossible facts are facts that can be true together. Composable facts entail compossible fact, but not vice-versa. First-person facts are facts with irreducible indexical content, i.e., I am A, which is distinct from I am B. 

Now, if F is ""I am A"" and F' is ""I am B"", then F != F', and vice-versa. Let's call it *the indexical incompossibility thesis*, viz., double I thesis. Double I thesis just says that indexical facts don't survive cross-subject aggregation without contradiction.

1mlywxe,https://i.redd.it/qebyrxibw1if1.jpeg,My new favorite espresso drink recipe,"So I’ve been making my own espresso for 2 years now and have always been a latte or cortado drinker. When I get my afternoon coffee at work the $4-5 lattes add up. One day I tried something new and it’s stuck. It’s now my favorite drink overall (more than a latte) but it works best at my office. I’ll explain.

We have a cafe at work (large office building) and it has a station with milk, sweeteners, honey, etc. I usually get a coffee at 1pm, this is critical because the milk that was likely cold in the morning is less cold now, probably room temp (maybe gross for some, but fine with me).

So the drink recipe is as follow:

-A double shot of espresso
-Little bit of honey. I’d guess 1/2 tspn.
-Two squirts of room temp milk. I’d guess 1 TBSP. 

I stir with a wooden stirrer and drink on my way back up to my desk. It really retains the intense flavor of the espresso with a bit of added sweetness and rounded edges.

I have trouble duplicating it at home and have to go through extra steps to make room temp milk at home haha. I pull some hot water into my milk pitcher. Dump it out and then let it sit while I prep my shot. I could certainly under-steam some milk, but then I have to wipe the wand lol. I could put it in the microwaves for 10 seconds, but that bothers me :). So this is my at home solution for my 2-3 drinks per week at home.

Give it a try and see if I’m nuts. Enjoy!!

P.S. the photo is not one I took, just pulled offline because that’s what my drink at work looks like.",2,1754770061.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

So what happened was, it was parent teacher conference at the kindergarten and this one kids mom was pregnant again. Like 6 months pregnant. She was still breastfeeding her kid as well. She came in quite early and we had a conversation regarding her son, when she suddenly had to leave, but promised to return later on. After the conference concluded she came back right when I started to pack up. She  apologized for leaving early and when I asked of she was ok, she started crying. She went on to explain that her husband had refrained from engaging in sexual acts with her since she's been pregnant, because he finds her body off putting. She's probably 5'4"" 140 pounds with massive DD's. After consoling her, she went on to say that she's so embarrassed because her hormones is driving her libido higher than ever, so she has to go ""releave"" herself throughout the day. I told her that it's fine and that I'm here to talk if she needs me. We proceeded with our previous discussions regarding her son, and in the middle of a sentence she suddenly stops and asks if it's fine if she expressed her milk since her breasts are starting to leak and her son and infant was at home with their father. She took out a manual breast pump from her big purse and latched it on to her engorged veiny breast. As she pumped, I got quite turned on seeing her milk drip out of her. I think she picked up on this and asked me if I've ever wondered what breastmilk tastes like. I told her I've tasted it before and it had a pleasant sweet aftertaste to me. She said that she's been eating a lot of pineapple and that it makes it even sweeter, making it easier for her to get her kid to feed. I was curious, and asked if I could taste. I thought she would give me the  bottle attached to her pump, but instead she stood up and put her gorgeous tits in ny face. She urged me to ""Have a suck"" and I did. I was still sitting on a chair and she stood over my legs, with her legs open. As I sucked, it was clear that she was hornier than anyone I've ever encountered. I felt something drip down my leg and noticed that she wasn't wearing any undies. She was literally moaning and dripping on my lap while I was feeding on her. I was horny as fuck, and started flicking her bean. All of a sudden she squirted all over me. I was shook, as I didn't expect it. She was ashamed and I told her that I had an extra Pair of clothes in my drawer since kids get quite messy. I'm quite submissive, so when she told me to undress and lie on the table, I quivered. I lied down and she sat on the chair with my legs over her shoulders and she ate me out like I never thought was possible. I came 3 times. By that time I was wetter than the floor (which had her squirt on it). She asked me to lie down on the floor and she sat over my face. She fucked my face  till she squirted in my mouth. She asked my to suck on her again while she fingered me and I fingered her. I don't know what it was, but I started to shake uncontrollably. I couldn't breathe. She didn't stop, instead she fingered me harder as curled up in a ball and while gasping for air. She squirted her milk all over my chest and out of the blue, I starting crying as everything turned black. When I regathered myself, I apologized and told her that I had no control. She politely helped me up and helped me get dressed. She thanked me, and asked me to let her know if I wanted to have coffee sometime.",1,1754770022.0,textspankbank,0,1.0,False

I know, almost impossible, read a thread here (5months ago) about some amazing guy on loper who created a spreadsheet on how to counter cabin fever loss of condition with a lot of coffees and birch bark tea's. My question is, actually, does the game consider the 25 consecutive days as ""per 24h spent"" in the mine, or is it that I need to be in the mine when the in-game time goes from 23.59 to 00.01? If it's the second one, then is midnight when the moon is in the middle when checking the time during tab press?

If it's the first, well, I don't exactly have many tea's and coffees, so I might have to leave ZOC for HQ and come back and try the spreadsheet myself (or just do it in pilgrim?)

1mlypr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1mlypr8/my_coffee_ice_cream_turned_out_exceptionally_good/,"My coffee ice cream turned out exceptionally good, what happened?","I've used this ice cream base recipe with a number of different flavors and it's always turned out pleasingly smooth, creamy, etc. This was my first time trying it out as a coffee flavor, and it's on an entirely different level: it was noticeably thick even before being churned, and once it was it was it took on a texture that was denser and creamier than anything I'd ever made before. I'm not making this post to brag lol, I just want to know what happened here so I can better understand the process and possibly replicate it. 

Base recipe: 

750g milk
360g heavy cream
45g skim milk powder 
1.5g xanthan gum 
180g granulated sugar 
60g light corn syrup 

Combine milk, cream, and milk powder in a pot over medium heat and stir until milk powder dissolves, heat until steaming and just about to boil, set aside. 

Whisk sugar and xanthan gum together in a bowl and add corn syrup, mix until homogeneous. 

Add milk/cream to bowl and mix until the sugar slurry is dissolved. Chill in the fridge until completely cooled. Churn and freeze. 

As I said, I've made this multiple times before with various flavors and it's always been good but never like this. The only change I made this time was adding ~1.25 cups of whole coffee beans to the milk/cream and letting it steep, covered, for an hour after heating (straining afterwards).

1mlynpg,https://youtu.be/LhrbBuhr7VA?si=wiYLnhVGJsENhzR7,Millab M01 - first impressions & brewing video,"Millab M01 – First Impressions Review
I’ve been testing the M01 for a week, and here are my early thoughts.
TL;DR:
It’s an excellent grinder with a premium feel and a cup quality I really enjoy. My first brews were vibrant, clean, and smooth. There are a few minor drawbacks — a tightly fitting handle and the absence of the foldable handle I’ve come to love on other Timemore grinders — but overall, it’s impressive.

Grind Quality & Taste
I tested a range of light-roasted beans:
•	Washed Kenyan “Karigoto” from Tim Wendelboe
•	Various washed, naturals and honey-processed beans from local roasters (Kaffemik, Wildkaffee, and Gota Coffee)
•	Co-fermented decaf from D Stands For
Compared to my Timemore C3, the M01 produces cups with noticeably fewer astringent notes. The brews are clean, smooth, and pleasantly vibrant across the board.
For brewing, I mainly used Lance Hedrick’s one-pour method. My initial grind sizes were:
•	Decaf: 7–8
•	Others: 6–7
Drawdown was consistently faster than with the C3, yet extraction quality was better.
Handling
Yes, the M01 is heavy — especially next to my C3 Pro Max — but I didn’t find it uncomfortable. The ribbed black grip is excellent, and I can wrap my hand fully around the body without strain.
The catch cup’s locking mechanism has been praised elsewhere, and it does work well — satisfying to click in place. That said, I personally prefer the classic screw-on style of the C3.
What I really miss is the foldable handle found on other Timemore grinders. Oddly, the C3’s handle fits the M01, and according to Junior Vargas’ comparison with the Comandante, the Comandante handle also fits.
The material of the catch cup means some fines tend to cling to the inner walls, so you’ll need to brush or tap it out regularly.

Build Quality
The M01 feels solid and well-made overall. The only real gripe is with the handle knob — its edges feel sharper than I’d like, especially compared to the smoother feel of the C3’s knob. This seems to be a deliberate design choice, not a manufacturing defect.
The crank fits very tightly. Others recommend using food-safe lubricants, and I suspect it will loosen over time. 

instead of the coin a Bag / case would have been nice. 
Support & Shipping

# Moose horns for Sale 2025: Find the Best Set!

Moose horns, also known as antlers, are highly sought-after items for a variety of reasons. Hunters often prize them as trophies, while artisans and craftspeople use them to create unique furniture, jewelry, and decorative items. Interior designers incorporate them into rustic and natural-themed spaces. The demand for shed moose horns, which are naturally dropped and ethically sourced, continues to grow, making the process of finding the perfect set crucial for buyers. This article helps the interested party navigate the market and find the best moose horns for sale in 2025, exploring key features, benefits, and considerations.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of moose horns entails an assessment of several product characteristics that ensure quality, utility, and value.

**Size and Spread:** The size and spread of moose horns are primary considerations. Large, wide racks are typically more valuable and visually striking. Size is generally measured by the widest inside spread, tine length, and overall mass. A large moose rack can easily exceed 50 inches in width.

A larger spread is often correlated with older, more mature moose, making these horns more desirable. Spread can impact the use of the horns also. Interior designers may want to consider physical constraints to a space,while other buyers may look only for maximum spread. The overall mass of the antlers, resolute by the diameter of the bases and the thickness of the tines, lends to the notable size of the specimens.

**Point Configuration:** The number and arrangement of points (tines) on moose horns considerably influence their aesthetic appeal and overall value. A well-developed rack will feature numerous, symmetrical points that create a balanced and impressive appearance. The points can be short and stubby, or long and graceful, depending on the age and genetics of the moose.
The terminology used for point configuration may vary by region and local hunting custom. however,the impact is similar. the points on the horns can dictate how an artisan may use the specimen, or what type of aesthetic a buyer wants. The number of symmetrical points are commonly sought.

**Color and Texture:** The natural color and texture of moose horns add to their unique character. Freshly shed antlers typically have a dark, rich brown color that gradually fades to a lighter tan as they age and are exposed to the elements. The texture can range from smooth and polished to rough and weathered, depending on the surroundings in which they were shed and how long they have been exposed. The buyer needs to consider where the antlers will be used to inform their color and texture preferences.

The color is influenced by several factors, making each set unique. Weathering, UV exposure, and contact with soil can all impact the coloration. A darker color might potentially be more pleasing to some buyers while a lighter color may fit another aesthetic.

**Shed condition:** The condition of the shed moose horns is a crucial factor in determining their usability and value.Intact, undamaged antlers are more desirable, as they retain their original shape and structural integrity. Cracks, breaks, or excessive weathering can diminish their aesthetic appeal and reduce their suitability for certain applications. The buyer must assess what their goals are when assessing shed condition.

The time antlers have been exposed to the elements can impact their usability. Antlers that have been exposed to rain, snow, and UV sunlight can lead to surface cracks and discoloration. Buyers need to carefully inspect the antlers for any signs of significant damage.

**Origin and Legality:** The origin of moose horns is a essential consideration, both from an ethical and legal standpoint.Reputable dealers or sellers will be able to provide facts about where the antlers came from and ensure that they were obtained legally and ethically, typically through shed-hunting practices that do not harm the animals. It is indeed significant to verify the source of the antlers and to ensure that all relevant permits and regulations have been followed.

Depending on the region, ther may be specific regulations regarding the collection and sale of shed antlers. Buyers must familiarize themselves with these regulations to avoid any legal issues. The seller should ideally provide documentation verifying the legality of the antlers.

Craftspeople that work with unique materials will be able to create bespoke or niche products for buyers.

**Lasting and Ethical Sourcing:** Shed moose horns represent a sustainable and ethical alternative to other animal products. Since they are naturally shed each year, collecting them does not harm the animals or disrupt their natural behavior. This makes them an environmentally conscious choice for those who value responsible sourcing and ethical consumption.

Shed hunting, when conducted responsibly, can even contribute to wildlife conservation by providing valuable data on moose populations and habitat use. By choosing shed antlers, buyers actively support sustainable practices and contribute to the well-being of these animals. Responsible purchasing supports eco-conscious choices.

We are basically the same good, decent people were were before but are also different, more authentic and open minded.  Upon leaving my DH was pretty pragmatic and undramatic as is his personality, even though he served in so many high profile callings.  He was just ready to shift. I, on the other hand, was a ball of pure rage.  I went through a ""rebellious"" stage and was the one to buy the coffee machine, hang the pride flag and start the wonderful habit of cussing here and there when I felt like it. Damnit. Every time I swore, my husband would give me a look of shock and maybe a little bit of judgement.  He is not a self-righteous prick in any way- but he just has a mental block about swearing.  He only swore maybe two times in our entire marriage of over 30 years. I started pushing back on those looks with some good natured humor, ""Are you judging me for saying ""shit""? You must be Mormon."" He would grin and loosen up.  

Anyway, he unfortunately, has a truly narcissistic  and toxic co worker and was reaching boiling point dealing with him. One day he came home and was just venting about this person. It wasn't really helping but I listened and commiserated. I finally said, ""Don't you wish you could just say, ""F\*\*\* you, Marco!""  

Our 20 year old daughter walked in on the conversation at that moment and said, ""Say it Dad.  Just say, F\*\*\* you, Marco."" 

My husband just crossed his arms and kind of rolled his eyes.  Then outa his mouth burst, ""F\*\*\* YOU, MARCO!""  There was a moment of stunned silence and then my daughter cracked up and I started laughing and then my husband started laughing so hard he had tears streaming.  It was cathartic on so many levels. And just like that another Mormon, brainwashing shackle (with it's corresponding control, judgement and shame) clicked open and fell to the ground with a tinny ping.

Before I started college I had found a sales job in cell phones for a big box store. My manager was leaving her position and thought I was the best candidate to replace her, much to my protests as I had worked there maybe 3 months at that point. For some reason, I had become manager to our team.  Looking back i don't regret caving as it definitely gave me a foot in the door for my current career path. 
Since dropping out I've somehow found myself in a few managerial positions in food service, mostly coffee shops as is my passion. I am currently a Food Service Coordinator for my local community center making 62k a year. My issue is that there's no real growth in this position. There's no promotion to aim towards for higher pay, there's minimum raises that could happen and I feel like if I stop here then I'm stuck.
My question is; is it worth it going back to college to get a degree in either business management or hospitality? With how expensive college is, and the time that I'd need to put in, while still working full time, does it make sense to try to start from basically scratch, or is there another option? Every position I'm applying for has ""degree needed"" as one of their first points of requirements. Do I really need a degree under my name to be even considered at this point?

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

1mlyew3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mlyew3/the_son_who_looked_down/,The son who looked down.,"The first thing Kal-El noticed about Earth was how loud it was.

Even from orbit, the noise reached him—radio signals, thermal bursts, electromagnetic traffic, scattered across the surface like a cracked mosaic of voices. He floated there for a while, watching the blue world spin beneath him, his red eyes narrowing with thought. Krypton had lived in silence for centuries after the quake wars. Even now, its people moved with solemn grace, voices low, systems clean. Earth, by comparison, was chaos.

But it was a kind of beautiful chaos.

Kal descended slowly, passing through the ionosphere without a ripple. He was careful not to flare his aura—no sonic booms, no light shows. The humans below were primitive compared to Krypton’s standards, but not foolish. He had read their files. Earth had seen aliens before. It had scars to show for it.

He landed in the middle of Kansas.

He didn’t choose it for irony, though some part of him appreciated the poetic geometry of it—his father’s star charts had flagged this region as “suitable for survival” during his original escape plan. Jor-El had once prepared a pod to send Kal-El here. But then Jor-El had fled alone.

Kal had never needed Earth. He had rebuilt Krypton without it. But now, after defeating Blackstar’s echo, after seeing the stars bleed and the void nearly take them all, Kal wanted something that terrified him more than battle.

Perspective.

So he came to Earth.

And he came alone.

The field he landed in was empty, dusted gold and green, the scent of wheat thick in the breeze. A farmhouse stood a half-mile off, quaint and crooked with age. A man stepped out onto the porch, hand shielding his eyes.

Kal walked toward him.

The man was middle-aged, calloused hands, gray streaking his beard. He wasn’t afraid—just wary.

“You okay there, son?” the man called out. “You fall outta the sky or somethin’?”

Kal said nothing for a moment. He studied the man’s face.

“I’m… visiting,” Kal finally said. His Kryptonian accent still had a razor edge to it, but the translator embedded in his suit softened the tones.

The man laughed. “Well, you’re either a skydiver or something stranger. Name’s Clark. Clark Kent.”

Kal blinked.

That name.

He knew it.

One of the last names his father had considered for him—if the Earth plan had gone through.

Clark held out a hand. Kal stared at it, then slowly reached out and shook it. He could feel the warmth in the man’s palm, the genuine welcome behind the gesture.

“Well, Clark Kent,” Kal said, with a dry smile. “It’s a pleasure.”

Clark gestured toward the porch. “You hungry? I make a mean corned beef hash. Can’t have my guest from the stars starving.”

Kal hesitated, then nodded. “Yes. I’d like that.”

They sat on the porch, drinking black coffee and eating from tin plates. Kal had never tasted coffee before. It was bitter, oddly grounding. The silence between them stretched comfortably.

Clark didn’t ask questions. Not right away. Kal appreciated that.

But eventually, curiosity won.

“So where are you really from?” Clark asked.

Kal stared at the horizon. “Krypton.”

Clark’s jaw slackened slightly. “The Krypton? As in… exploded Krypton?”

“It didn’t explode.”

Clark blinked. “Say again?”

Kal looked down at his cup. “It should have. The science was sound. The core was unstable. But at the last moment, it stabilized. My father had already fled, thinking it doomed. He left me behind.”

Clark was quiet.

“I rebuilt it,” Kal said, softly. “I led them through collapse. Through civil war. Through something worse. I am not a king. But I am their guide.”

Clark chuckled. “Well, hell. We got presidents and senators, but nobody quite like that.”

Kal gave him a sideways look. “Do you?”

Clark leaned back, watching the stars emerge. “We had one,” he said. “He died fighting something that fell from the sky. Name was Superman. Wore your symbol, actually. The ‘S’.”

Kal looked down at his chest. The glyph of the House of El shimmered faintly. “It’s not an ‘S.’ It’s hope.”

Clark nodded. “Funny. He said the same thing.”

Kal was quiet a moment, then asked, “Did you know him?”

Clark’s eyes darkened. “Yeah. Yeah, I did. He was a friend. The best kind. Always believed in people. Always gave them one more chance.”

Kal nodded slowly. “And did it save them?”

Clark sighed. “Sometimes.”

They didn’t speak again until the sky was pitch black.

The next day, Kal flew over Metropolis.

He didn’t hide himself. But he didn’t announce his arrival, either. People saw a streak in the sky—red and silver, not green or blue—and speculated. The media ran blurry shots. “NEW ALIEN SPOTTED—SUPERMAN RETURNS?” they asked.

Kal did not correct them.

He landed atop the Daily Planet building, watching the city below. So different from Krypton’s cities. Organic. Chaotic. Beautifully alive.

A voice behind him: “You’re not him.”

Kal turned.

A woman stood there. Mid-thirties, dark hair streaked with defiance. Holding a pen like a weapon.

Lois Lane.

“I’ve read the records,” Kal said.

“I’ve read the reports,” she answered. “You’re not Clark. You’re not our Superman.”

“No.”

“But you’re Kryptonian.”

“Yes.”

She stepped forward, not afraid. “Why are you here?”

Kal looked down at the traffic, the people.

“To see if he was right to love this place.”

Lois blinked. “He did love it. All of it. Even the worst parts.”

“I don’t understand how.”

“That’s because you weren’t raised here,” she said. “You didn’t grow up in a world that needed saving. You grew up saving one.”

That hit harder than Kal expected.

He nodded.

“I’ve rebuilt cities,” he said. “Held tectonic plates together. Fought gods. But I’ve never… watched a mother walk her child through a food line. Never stopped a drunk from hitting his wife. It’s all… smaller here. More fragile.”

Lois crossed her arms. “Then maybe that’s what makes it worth saving.”

He looked at her, and for a second, saw why Clark had loved her.

“Would he have stayed,” Kal asked, “if Krypton had lived?”

Lois hesitated.

Then: “No. He loved his people, but Earth… Earth made him who he was. Krypton made him possible. Earth made him human.”

Kal stood in silence.

He returned to Kansas that evening. Sat with Clark again on the porch. Said nothing. Just watched the wind move across the wheat.

“I think I understand now,” Kal said.

Clark glanced at him. “Understand what?”

“Why Jor-El wanted to send me here. Why he thought this place might be salvation.”

Clark nodded. “We’re a mess. But we care. And when someone falls, someone else always reaches out.”

Kal looked at his hands.

He had lifted mountains. Burned through stars.

But he had never held a child.

Never taught one to read.

Never buried a dog in the yard.

He envied this world.

When he left Earth, he left a seed in Kansas soil.

It was a Kryptonian tree—one of the last. Genetically restructured to adapt to Earth’s ecosystem. It would grow strong. Tall. Bloom red and silver every spring.

Clark Kent never told anyone where it came from.

And one day, years later, a little boy would sit under that tree, reading a comic about Superman.

Not the one who died.

But the one who looked down from the stars—

—and decided the Earth was worth understanding.

As someone who takes their morning caffeine ritual seriously, upgrading my espresso machine setup felt essential. This particular filter is marketed as enhancing espresso quality by reducing chlorine, heavy metals, and other minerals while also contributing to the longevity of the machine itself. It sounded like the perfect addition to my setup, and after using it, I have some thoughts to share.

**Compact Build and Easy Installation**  
One of the things I appreciated immediately was its design. The compact dimensions (4.72""D x 2.17""W x 1.97""H) make it a breeze to handle. While the plastic construction might feel a bit lightweight, it doesn’t come across as flimsy. Installation took me no more than a minute. I didn't even need complicated instructions—just inserted it properly into the water tank of my Breville espresso machine, and I was good to go. It’s compatible with several Breville models, ensuring broad usability. If you're like me and dread setting up new gadgets, this filter's simplicity will be a relief.  

**Highlighting Perks of this Water Filter**  
- Enhances espresso flavor by reducing limescale buildup, chlorine, heavy metals, and minerals.  
- Compact and lightweight design ensures it fits snugly inside the water tank without being intrusive.  
- Prolongs the life of espresso machines by reducing mineral deposits.

**Improvement in Espresso Quality**  
After installing the filter, I noticed subtle but significant changes in the taste of my espresso. My water is notoriously hard, so there’s usually a detectable mineral flavor in my coffee. Once I started using this filter, those off-notes disappeared. Whether I’m pulling a dark roast espresso shot or preparing a smooth latte, the coffee’s natural flavors come through more distinctly. This convinced me that the filter was indeed doing its job by reducing water impurities, though I wouldn’t say it performs miracles.  

**Potential Downsides**  
- Plastic construction might feel less premium to some users, though it performs as needed.  
- Requires replacement every 90 days, which adds to long-term costs.  
- Limited compatibility with non-Breville machines, so you'll have to verify your model beforehand.  

**Performance: Measured Over Time**  
This filter is not something you’ll notice working in a flashy or obvious way, but performance is evident when thinking about the bigger picture. My espresso machine has been running smoother, and I haven’t had to descale it as frequently as I used to. Over months of use, it feels like the product helps maintain machine efficiency, which is an understated yet valuable feature. Those who truly value keeping their machines in top shape will appreciate this.  

**Alternative Solutions or Competitors**  
A few competing water filters are available, like the AquaCrest Espresso Machine Water Filter or the Keurig Water Filter Cartridges. The AquaCrest option is cheaper but doesn’t have the seamless compatibility this filter offers for Breville machines. Keurig’s product, meanwhile, targets its own coffee systems and isn’t interchangeable with espresso machines. Where Breville’s water filter excels is its perfect fit and tailored filtering for espresso preparation. Alternatives may offer generic filtration, but they lack the machine-specific engineering seen here.  

**Assessing the True Value**  
Looking at the price-to-quality ratio, this filter sits at a reasonable spot, especially considering the benefits it provides for espresso enthusiasts. The reduced need for descaling and improved water quality make it worthy of long-term investment. While there’s a recurring cost involved with replacing it every 90 days, I found the price justifiable for the improvements in taste and machine maintenance. If you're uncertain about committing, ask yourself: how much is a consistently tasty cup of espresso worth to you?

 I'm 30 years old, and I've had episodes of high blood pressure since I was a kid. From time to time, I've had hypertensive crises with blood pressure of 180/120. 
Then, I might not have any problems for several months. I've tried taking valsartan, but it lowered my blood pressure too much, even when I used the lowest dose. I stopped taking valsartan and started monitoring my blood pressure. It's always normal, 120-130. But sometimes, for no reason, I have these crises.
 Recently, I was having coffee with my girlfriend in a cafe, and I suddenly felt very ill. I was shaking all over, and I couldn't speak. An ambulance arrived, and by the time they took me to the hospital, I was feeling better. I've had panic attacks before, but this wasn't one of them. I can tell the difference. Just now, I got out of the shower and felt unwell, with a blood pressure of 170/110.
 I feel spasms in my head, as if my blood vessels are compressed to the limit. I think it's related to adrenaline, but I don't understand why my blood vessels react so strongly to it. One thing is tachycardia, and another is symptoms similar to a stroke. However, I have a healthy heart, and my brain MRI scans are normal. I believe it's related to sympathetic tone.

My Wife Called Him Ours, But He Wasn’t Like Other Boys. This Is What It’s Like to Love a Son Who Isn’t Human, And What It Cost Us to Keep Him.","The storm came over the plains and static crawled the porch rail and the mesquite ghosted in the flashes. Sarah laid her palm on mine and it was cold. We’d been living in that little house for fifteen years and not one room had ever grown bigger. We’d tried for a baby till the trying got to be an animal in the room.

“You hear that?” she said.

“I don’t want to hear it,” I said.

“Don’t do this,” she said. “Not tonight.”

A light burned across the pasture and it wasn’t lightning. It went down into the lower field and the cattle didn’t bawl, didn’t run, they just pressed themselves to the north fence like they’d been put there by a hand.

Sarah stood. “Caleb,” she said.

“I ain’t going.” I said. 

She already had my jacket and she slung it at my chest and her eyes were wet like they get when the grief is older than the words for it. She pulled on boots with no socks and we went out into the weather.

We crossed the rocked drive, crossed the gumbo that took your boots, crossed the line where the floodlights make a last stand. The smell coming up out of the field was like an electrical fire wrapped in sugar. We came over the little swell that runs down to the windbreak and saw where the ground had been laid open like a bad cut.

Soil slumped to the sides, roots pulled like nerves. In the middle was a thing the size of a feed trough and it gleamed like glass found in a riverbed and it was sweating. Not with water but with something that steamed even in the rain and ate the grass where it fell.

“Don’t touch it,” I said.

Sarah didn’t even look at me. “Do you hear that?” 

The sound was a quick and dry clicking sound like locusts trapped in a jar.

Something moved inside that shine. A crack opened. It wasn’t a hinge. The surface pulled itself apart in threads the way a spider halts a web and retracts it. Within it was a cloth. Not a cloth. Something like a cloth that the water would not cling to. In it was a small shape.

We had both been on too many hospital beds and in too many waiting rooms, but I had never seen Sarah move with that certainty. She dropped to her knees in the mud and she reached into the shining thing and the wet hissed when her arms went in. She flinched, but not enough to stop.

“Don’t,” I said again. 

She lifted him out and he was a baby boy and he was not crying. He was slick and his eyes were open and they reflected the storm like the pondwater reflects the sky. His little chest didn’t move. I counted that in my head. Sarah put him to her. She cried. The rain came down harder and did not touch his face. It split on him like he wore a glass mask the size of his skull.

“What the hell is he?” I said.

“He’s ours,” she said.

“Sarah… We can’t.”

She looked up at me like she would have struck me if she weren’t holding him. “He’s ours,” she said. 

We took him back to the house and the electricity was gone. I carried a lantern I found in the pantry and the light made its own church out of the kitchen. Sarah made a bed of towels in a drawer and set him there like he might float away. She touched his cheek like she was afraid of waking him and he wasn’t even asleep.

“He ain’t breathing,” I said.

“Hush,” she said.

“We have to call someone.”

“Who? The sheriff?” She turned to me. “You want to tell Hector we found a baby that fell out of the sky and we put him in the drawer next to the plastic bags?”

“This ain’t right. He ain’t right,” I said and my voice cracked and I hated the sound of it.

“Don’t you dare say that about him.” She was close to me. I could smell the rain on her and the metal stink of whatever was still on her hands. “I prayed,” she said. “I have prayed for a child. I have prayed this house full and empty a thousand times. I am done with prayers that don’t get answered.”

The boy turned his head slowly until he was looking straight at me. He did not blink. A baby will blink. He did not. The pupils were wide as if the night lived in him and he did not mind it.

“What scares you?” Sarah said.

“I don’t know,” I said.

“Say you’ll try.”

I couldn’t look at the drawer. I looked at the kitchen floor and the cracks in it where I’d dropped a wrench years ago. 

“I’ll… I’ll try,” I said.

“Say more.”

“I’ll be his daddy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “I don’t know how but I will.”

She smiled then and she put her hand on my chest like she was thanking me for some old mercy I hadn’t given. She leaned to the drawer and said quietly, “Jack,” like she’d just remembered a name she’d been saving. “Jack,” she said again. “You hear me? Your name is Jack.”

We went back out with the shovel. The glittering thing in the field cooled to a dull skein like frost that wouldn’t melt. The shovel edge squealed on it and the sound hurt my teeth. We dragged it to the well house and shoved it inside and shut the door and braced it with a beam that had held up my father’s barn until the tornado took it.

“You’re shaking,” she said.

“I know I am.”

She took my face in both hands. “We asked for a baby and we got one,” she said. “Don’t run from an answer.”

We slept with the drawer on the nightstand. I lay on my back with the shotgun on my chest like a man who’s not right in the head. Rain ticked on the window till dawn. I didn’t sleep. 

The boy lay on the towels and watched me. At one point the refrigerator hummed without power and then went quiet and I thought about the thing in the well house singing to itself like a wire under load.

Right before sunup, something knocked once in the ground below us. It was not the house. It was not the wind. It was like something under the slab was asking if we remembered what we’d done.

We told folks we adopted. Most folks smiled and nodded and some asked where from and we said down in Abilene and left it at that and Sarah would squeeze my hand beneath the table and I would squeeze back because I loved her and because my jaw had begun to hurt from clenching it.

Jack grew fast and he never spiked a fever. He never caught a cough. His skin stayed milk pale even after days in the pasture. He slept with his eyes open sometimes. I’d wake to the feeling of being watched and he’d be standing beside the bed, and he’d say, “You were dreaming,” and he would list what I’d seen in my dream and be correct.

“You talk in your sleep,” he said once.

“What did I say?”

“You said you were sorry.”

“For what?”

“I don’t know,” he said. He didn’t blink. “You just said it a lot.”

As he grew he took to chores. Fencelines went straight where I’d never managed to get them true. He could lift feed sacks like they were paper. The chickens ran sideways when he came near and then froze like their minds went out. The dog, old Buck I’d had from a pup, tucked his tail and pissed himself if Jack touched him. After a week of that the dog disappeared. I walked the creekbed and called till my voice got hoarse and no answer came back but the echo of me. I didn’t tell Sarah that I found fur matted into the grass by the pumpjack with no blood to go with it.

“You ever think something’s wrong with his hands?” I said once in the kitchen, and I realized when I said it I’d been studying Jack’s hands for months.

Sarah laid the spoon down. “What about them?”

“They’re too smooth.”

“He’s a boy.”

“Everybody’s got lines in their hands,” I said, and I took his little palm in mine like I was only fooling and there weren’t any. Not a crease. The skin glossy and fine like a thing right out of a mold.

Jack pulled his hand back. “Don’t.”

“Hey now,” I said. “I was just joking …”

“I don’t like it,” he said. “You look too hard.”

He watched me like he might learn something he didn’t want to learn and then he went outside and stood by the fields and looked at the sky so long I had to call him in.

He started school and he didn’t have any trouble with the words or the numbers and he came home with worksheets with little blue stars on them. When I said anything about the stars he regarded the paper like it had a bad smell.

“You don’t like school?” I said.

“It’s loud.”

“It’s loud everywhere,” I said.

“Not everywhere.” He said.

Six months into fifth grade, there was a boy named Eldridge that gave Jack hell for talking little. Eldridge had a lopsided haircut and a mean smile. He and two friends put a dead field mouse in Jack’s locker and wrote alien on his history book and drew eyes on the corners of the pages so they would wink when you flicked them.

I asked Jack about it and he said, “It doesn’t matter.”

“Don’t let them make you small,” I said. “I can talk to the principal about it.”

He turned to me at the table. “What would you tell him?”

“That there’s boys picking on you.”

“What if I don’t want you to?”

“What are you going to do?”

He didn’t answer and I felt something slide in my chest like a drawer coming open that I hadn’t pulled.

Eldridge didn’t show up to school the next Wednesday. The sheriff’s trucks went down to the quarry with their lights low. The teachers said words and the news didn’t say anything. Sarah said, “People do run,” and I said, “Do they,” and she knew I was thinking and she pressed her mouth thin and didn’t talk to me most of that night.

Two weeks. Then it was the Henderson girl with a ribbon in her hair and a giggle that carried down the hall. 

Then it was another boy you saw at the gas station after practice with a burger and a chocolate milk. 

Folks met at church and they bowed their heads and talked about coyotes and men in dirty vans and the border like anyone in a van was interested in a dusty little town with a Dairy Queen and a feed store.

Sheriff Hector Mendez pulled his Tahoe up in our drive at dusk. I could feel the old fear come over me like a wet sheet.

“Caleb,” he said when I met him at the porch. “Sarah.”

“Come on in,” Sarah said, and I could hear how hard she was trying to keep it level.

Hector took his hat off in our kitchen. The man has patience in him like a tree has rings. He eyed Jack sitting with his homework out on the table.

“You like school Jack?”

Jack looked at him like he could see through the badge and the shirt. “It’s loud,” he said.

Hector smiled at Sarah. “Kids,” he said. “Can I ask him something?”

“You can,” Sarah said.

“Jack you know Eldridge?”

“Yes.”

“You see him last Tuesday?”

“No.”

“You hear anything?”

Jack looked down at his paper. Long division. His pencil rested at the margin. “I hear a lot of things,” he said.

“Like what?” Hector asked.

Jack lifted his eyes slow and Hector flinched before he knew he had because he had looked straight into that still dark and it had looked back.

“Wind,” Jack said. “Mice. Ants. The pump. My mom crying.”

Sarah closed her eyes.

Hector nodded. He wrote nothing in the little book he carried. He put his hat back on and stood and he laid his hand on my shoulder as we walked to the door and he squeezed it like a pastor. “You tell me if you see anything.”

“I will,” I said.

“You look tired,” he said.

We looked at each other a second too long and then he left.

That night I went out to the well house with my flashlight. The beam licked the door and the boards we’d nailed into the studwork. I unbarred it. I opened the door and the light went dead.

I waited in the dark with my heart in my mouth until my eyes found the outlines of things. The shape in the corner was there. The thing we’d dragged and left. It was not the shape it had been. It had collapsed and flayed itself open into threads like a net. The threads were bonded to the concrete and they moved with no air. A slow breathing motion that made my stomach turn. In the middle was a low dent like a nest. There were marks in the concrete around it like someone had put their palms there, and the marks were too small for mine and in the wrong pattern. No creases.

“Caleb?” a voice said in the doorway. Sarah was there with the lantern. “Why are you out here?”

“You know why,” I said. My voice was small.

She stepped in and saw and the lantern shook in her hand. “He doesn’t come out here,” she said.

“Then you bring him?”

“Don’t you start.”

“You did it.”

“I’m his mother.”

“What is he?”

She leaned the lantern on the shelf and came near the thing and I grabbed her wrist and pulled hard and she yanked against me like a cat. “What are you doing?” she said.

“It’s singing,” I said. “You hear it?”

“I don’t hear anything.”

“It’s under the floor,” I said. “It’s in the pipes. It’s in the fuckin walls. Have you…”

“Stop cussing,” she said. “Not here.”

We stood like that and we listened and she did hear something because she started to cry without moving her face. “It’s a lullaby,” she said.

“It ain’t,” I said. “It’s some type of a call.”

“Then it’s calling him home,” she said. “And he’s not going.”

Next morning I found Jack by the stock tank barefoot in the cold and he was staring into the water and the water was flat as steel and the perch lay belly up and did not bob.

“What are you doing?” I said.

“Listening,” he said.

“I don’t want you by this tank.”

“Okay,” he said. He didn’t move.

“Why are the fish like that?”

“They forgot,” he said.

“Forgot what?” I said.

“How to swim,” he said. “How to want it.”

A wind moved through the trees and not one ripple crossed the water. I took his arm and he let me take him and we walked to the house in silence and I made him hot chocolate like a decent man and watched the steam wander up like something with a soul.

That night I told Sarah I was going to see Pastor Thom.

“Not with him,” she said. “You won’t take him there like he’s some disease.”

“I’m going alone,” I said.

She looked at my face. “You’re frightened,” she said.

“I am,” I said.

She put her hands on my cheeks and I closed my eyes because it is an old habit of mine. “Don’t bring anything home from that church,” she said. “If he needs saving, he’ll tell us.”

Jack was in the doorway. 

“From what?” He said.

We said nothing to him and his eyes were calm.

Pastor Thom keeps that little clapboard church like a man keeps an account he’s ashamed of. He sees to it but only when he has to. The steeple leans a degree you don’t notice till you’re standing under it. Inside it smells like paper and old oranges.

He listened like men listen when they’ve already decided the end of your sentence before you get to it. I told him what I could. I left out the part where I wanted to run.

“Children are strange,” he said.

“I don’t need a platitude. I need someone who’ll tell me the truth.”

“The truth is God gives and God takes away.”

“God didn’t put that thing in my well house.”

“You don’t know what God looks like when He works.”

“Don’t,” I said. 

I stood and he stood with me.

“You want to bring him in?” he said.

“I told Sarah I wouldn’t.”

“You think your wife is right.”

“I didn’t say that.”

He looked at the scuffed floorboards. “Bring him Sunday,” he said softly. “Sit him down in the third pew.”

I brought him. Sarah came too. She sat with her shoulder pressed into mine so hard my arm went numb and I didn’t shake it because I knew what that pressure was holding up.

“Look at me,” I told Jack in the truck. “We go in there, we’re there to sit and sing. You don’t do anything else.”

“Like what?” he said.

“You know what I mean.”

“I don’t.”

“I think you do,” I said.

We sat inside the chapel and the light slid through the dusty window slats and found people’s backs and hair and the crowns of their heads. When the hymn started Sarah’s voice came up out of her like water. In the second verse, Jack put his hands flat on the pew and the pew knocked once in a way it had not done in years.

“Don’t,” I said under my breath.

He didn’t look at me. 

He was looking up, watching nothing particular.

When the offering plate came, he set his fingers to the rim and the coins balanced there rolled themselves to his touch until they lay in a pattern and it wasn’t a pattern your eye took easy. Thom saw it and smiled so quick like he meant to be kind.

Communion came and Thom raised the little cup of wine and blessed it. The wine twitched in each cup like a horse skinning a fly. I had my hand around mine and mine began to warm. Jack held his and it went clear. Everyone drank and coughed like they were choking on smoke, one and then another, and then a little girl in a pink dress near the aisle bent and vomited a rope of black strings that fell to the wood and lay there quivering.

Sarah grabbed my wrist. 

“Jack,” I whispered, and he looked at me and the quivering stopped.

Thom’s face had gone the shade of paper. He set the last of the cups down on the table and it cracked. The wine inside brightened and bubbled and he slapped his hand over it and hissed. He jerked his palm up and there was a round burn like he’d pressed it to a stove.

After service he took me out behind the church. He didn’t look at me when he spoke. “He shouldn’t come here,” he said.

“You said…”

“I know what I said.”

“What did you see?”

He looked toward the fields like they could get him out of this. “It was like all the doors opened at once. It was like standing in a hailstorm of voices. There were things in it that didn’t have names for me. I got scared.” He swallowed. “I’m still scared.”

“You think I’m not?” I said.

He folded his burned hand into the crook of his other elbow. “Take him home,” he said. “Keep him away from crowds. Don’t let folks touch him. You ought not let him touch you either.”

I went to the truck and Sarah was crying and she didn’t want me to see. Jack sat in the cab with his hands in his lap. “What’s wrong with Pastor Thom,” he said. “Nothing,” Sarah said. “Everything,” I said, and then I started the truck and Sarah bowed her head and prayed through her teeth and I stared at the dash.

That night I dreamed the well house net was on me like a shawl and it pulled at my teeth till they came out in a clatter in the sink. I woke to the windmill squealing in the distance, a dry, high skirl like a hog caught under a fence. Sarah stirred beside me and pressed the heel of her hand to her ear.

“Make it stop,” she said into the pillow. “Please.”

It had been doing that for a while, the tail hinge chattering and the turntable going dry. If you leave an Aermotor to scream, it’ll saw itself to scrap by morning and wake every soul in the section while it does it.

I got up and pulled on my boots. I took the can of oil from the nail by the door and the little wrench I kept with it.

Out in the yard the tower stood with its legs braced wide in the hard ground, the head shivering against its own rust. The squeal climbed the rungs into my palms. I set the brake and the vanes stuttered to a stop. 

I climbed to the platform and the bolts ticked under my weight. Oil went into the cups and along the turntable’s lip, down the rod guide where the sucker rod had been rubbing itself raw. The windmill sighed. The noise wound down to a wet whisper and then to nothing.

On the way back I cut across the yard, past the shadow of the cottonwoods and the dead patch where the grass won’t take, and saw light moving in the barn. A thin strip walked along the seam of the doors and then went still.

I stopped. “Jack?” I said.

He stepped out from the gloom with something in his arms. “Don’t be mad,” he said.

“What is it.”

“A calf,” he said.

“From who?”

“McKinney’s,” he said. “It’s deformed.”

The calf was the color of wet clay and it had two faces and the faces were not the same age. One eye was still milky and the other was bright and furious. Its legs kicked without a plan and it made a sound like a flute half broken. He set it down and put each of his hands on each of its faces and the barn smelled like hot pennies.

“Don’t,” I said. “Don’t touch it.”

Sarah was in the doorway with her nightgown on and her mouth open. “Jack,” she said. “Baby.” She stepped forward and Jack said, “Don’t touch it,” and she halted so clean it was like a rope had snapped tight.

He looked at me. “It hurts,” he said.

“I know it hurts,” I said.

He leaned down and said something to it. I couldn’t hear the words. They didn’t sound like words. The calf’s legs went still. Its chest fell once and did not rise again. He took his hands away and there were clean marks where his palms had been.

Sarah cried and touched his head and he let her and my breath came rough and when I could breathe right I said, “You took it from McKinney’s?” 

“It heard me,” he said. 

“You will not go on other folks’ properties,” I said.

“They’ll come here,” he said.  

“Who,” I asked, and he didn’t answer.

We dug for that calf in the spot where old Buck used to bury bones. The dirt there was soft and black and didn’t smell like our ground. When I turned in my sleep there was grit in the bed and in the morning it wasn’t dirt it was like something a moth makes and it stuck to my fingers.

The search parties ran the creekbed. Tractor beams panned the mesquite. Lima beans burned in pots while women stood on porches with their eyes on the dark. The feed store chalkboard had prayer requests for cows and children and old men and all got the same line.

Hector came by every other day till it felt like he lived at our kitchen table. He’d drink coffee that had been on the burner too long and he’d say, “You sleeping?” and I’d say, “Some,” and he’d glance at Jack like he was an engine he could troubleshoot if only he had the right Chilton manual.

“You want to go to the lake Saturday?” Hector asked Jack. “We’re running a line grid off the east shore. Could use another set of eyes.”

Jack looked at me and I shook my head hard without meaning to. “He won’t,” I said.

“You fish?” Hector asked him anyway.

“No,” Jack said.

“Good,” Hector said. “They’re all dead this week. Something in the water out from the chemical plant killed them.“

He nodded and looked at me. “You hear the bells at night?”

“What bells?”

“The old mission down by Ghost Draw. They’re rusted to hell. Haven’t rung in fifty years. Folks swear they hear them.” He studied me. “You hear them?”

“I hear things,” I said.

He sipped his coffee. “I brought the boy a comic,” he said, like he had to offer tribute to a god with a bad temper. He took a folded book from his jacket and slid it across and Jack took it and set it aside without opening it and Hector looked at that slight dismissal like it stung him between the ribs. He stood. “You call me,” he said. “About anything.” He looked at Sarah like maybe she’d say it if I didn’t. She nodded once.

McKinney came by after dark with a shotgun laid flat and the barrel pointed at my knee. He left the truck idling. “You seen a calf,” he said.

“What kind of a calf,” I said, and that was not the way to answer and we both knew it.

“A wrong calf,” he said.

Sarah was at my shoulder. “We haven’t,” she said. “I’m sorry.”

“You ain’t sorry,” he said. He spat into the yard and it steamed in the cold like everything living gives a little ghost when it leaves you. He looked past me into the house like he could pick the wrong thing out of the air by its smell. “If I find out you did, I’ll take payment.”

“If thats what you call it,” I said.

He said nothing else and rolled away.

“You see what happens?” I said to Sarah when the tail lights were gone. 

“We didn’t do it,” she said.

“We did something,” I said.

That night I took the truck and did not tell anyone and I went down to the quarry. A lone bulldozer sat under a tarp with its belly open and tools on a stained towel. I parked up above and walked down with the flashlight tucked into my belt. Each footfall kicked pebbles that skittered into the dark and then paused and then skittered again all at once like somebody shushed them and then let them go.

“Don’t move,” a voice said.

I did not move. “It’s just me,” I said. “It’s Caleb.”

“You shouldn’t be out here,” Hector said. He came around the little outcrop with his hand resting on the holster.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I said.

“Me either.” He looked past me into the pit. “Search starts again at sunup. County’s sending two more boats. We’ll drag the east shelf and the culvert.”

We stood with our shoulders near but not touching. The quarry fell away like an old bowl, its water flat and the color of dull tin. Something big moved under and did not break the surface. He watched the ripple kill itself against the rock and then he watched his boot grind a dark crescent in the dust.

“You think those kids are down there,” I said. My own voice took me by surprise, the way it went tender.

“I think I have to pretend they’re somewhere I can get to them,” he said. “Or I will put this gun in my mouth and that’ll be that.” He glanced at me and cleared his throat once. “Caleb,” he said. “I need you to be straight with me about Jack.”

“What about him.”

“Routine things,” he said. “Where he was Tuesday night after nine. Who he walked home with last week. Whether he’s been going out late. Has he said anything about the quarry or Ghost Draw. Has he had trouble with any of the boys we’re looking for.”

I studied the ripples flattening themselves. “You asking me if my boy had something to do with this.”

“I’m asking you to help me not miss something,” he said. “Folks are talking. I don’t run cases on talk. I do check the math. I’ve got a teacher says he left early one day last month and a kid says he saw him down near the culvert two nights back. Could be nothing. Could be the kind of nothing that turns out to matter after.”

“He was home,” I said.

He nodded once, not like he believed me or didn’t. “I’ve known you a long time. I’m not here to pick a fight with you. But I need you to hear this part. If your boy knows something, even if he didn’t do anything himself, we’re at the place where not telling gets somebody hurt.”

“And if it is him,” I said. “If.”

He held my eyes a beat and then let them go back to the water. “Do you think your boy did it?”

“I don’t know what I think,” I said.

“You’ve got a look about you like a man who knows exactly what he thinks and won’t put words to it in case saying them makes them true.” 

“You ever think words hold back the tide,” I said.

He looked at the water. “I think the tide don’t care what we do.” He turned to me full on. “If it is him, if, Caleb, what do you plan to do?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “He’s my son.”

“He’s got your last name,” Hector said. “He got anything else of yours?”

We left that place with no promise between us.

The next afternoon I found a circle burned into the back pasture. It wasn’t fire. The grass had gone gray and brittle and when I pressed it it broke like ash. In the center was a shape like a man but not. You’d think somebody had laid down in the field and rotted in it for an hour. The air over it hummed like a bug light.

“Jack,” I called. “Come here.”

He came at a run and then stopped when he got within twenty feet. “You shouldn’t come here,” he said.

“Why not?” 

“It’s the place I sit,” he said.

“What are you doing out here.”

“Listening,” he said. “Trying to make it quiet.”

“How do you make anything quiet?”

“I take it apart,” he said simply. “And see what piece makes the sound.”

“And whats that shape over there?”

“That’s where I was,” he said. His voice held no shame.

I grabbed him. He didn’t move.

“Don’t touch me,” he said.

“I’ll touch you when I want.”

“Don’t,” he said.

“Or what,” I said, and that was the wrong thing to say.

He twisted without twisting. There is no other way to say it. One second my wrist was on his arm and the next my hand was behind my back and my shoulder was lit with pain. I made a sound I never made in front of any man.

Sarah screamed from the porch. “Jack!” she cried. “Don’t you hurt him!”

Jack looked at her and for the first time something like fear moved under his face like a fish.

“I didn’t mean to,” he said, and he let me go and I fell onto my knees in the dead gray.

Sarah was running and her hair was loose and she hit him in the chest with both hands and I saw the skin on her palms redden and smoke. “Don’t you,” she said. “Don’t you forget whose you are.”

He stood still. He made a sound like a man being patient with a dog. “I am yours,” he said.

“Say it,” she said. “Say it you’re my son.”

“I’m your son,” he said, and he slipped his hands under her wrists and lifted them away from him like he was moving a hot pot on a stove. Blisters rose on her palms like a harvest of white pearls and he made a hurt noise and bent to blow on them and everywhere his breath went the blisters darkened and flattened and she gasped.

“You see,” she breathed. “You see…. You’re good.”

He looked from her to me and whatever you call that look later won’t change what it was.

That night I sat on the edge of the bed with the pistol in my lap and Sarah took it from me and set it on the dresser like she set down a glass and then she crawled into my lap like we were kids and my arms came up of their own. She laid her cheek against my chest and spoke into my shirt.

“You make promises you can’t keep,” she said.

“I know.”

“You’ll try to keep them anyway.”

“I will.”

“You’re scared,” she said.

“I am,” I said.

“I am too,” she said.

“I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing,” I said. “I am not the right man for this.”

“You’re the only one in the room,” she said. “That’s all God ever gives us.”

The house breathed. The windmill turned without wind. Somewhere the well house knocked twice like a knuckle on a door and then we heard a third knock that wasn’t in this world.

I woke to the smell of burning hair. It crawled down the hall and sat in our room like a guest you couldn’t send home. I walked into the kitchen and the toaster was on and empty and red and would not come up. I jerked the plug and the element glowed at me a last time and went dark.

“Jack?” I called. My voice was wrong in my throat.

He answered from outside. “I’m here.”

Sarah and I went out together. The dawn was thin. The yard held a smoke that did not move. I saw him by the cottonwoods, and I saw the things hanging from the lower branches and my body knew what they were before my head would name them. Three coyotes hung by their heels from the low limbs as if the trees had borne them in a mean season and would not let them fall. 

The hides were opened from throat to root and turned back like the flaps of a tent after a storm. The chests were scooped to a black vault like a dry well where no sound returns. Their innards were drawn and laid upon the earth in coils like hawser from a foundered ship, slick and stiffening, beaded with fat like candlewax, the loops of their intestines glistening as if oiled.

Steam lifted off them in the gray air like smoke from quenched iron. On that heap the hearts sat, three of them, the color of spoiled plums, whole and perfect and obscene in their stillness. There was a hum in the air like far wires in a desert wind and it was only the flies, thickbodied and brighteyed, already anchoring themselves to the gift, their feet set like nails, their green heads burning like little lamps. For all of it there was no blood on the ground and no footprints to be seen. A raven came down and hopped and watched and would not touch it.

“Oh… my… God…. Why… why….,” I said.

“They were howling,” he said.

“That’s what they do!” I said, and I couldn’t hear myself over the sound of my blood.

“They were calling names,” he said.

“What names.”

“Mine,” he said, and he looked up into the wide nothing over the cottonwoods and there was an answering. Not sound. A hole where the sound ought to be. The world around it tried to fill it and couldn’t and what was left was a burn in the shape of silence.

“Back,” I said to Sarah. “Go back,” I said, and she didn’t.

Jack’s eyes were wrong. He did not blink. He did not squint. His pupils pulled thin like an animal and then thin again till there was almost nothing left and there in that little slit something stood up and walked to the front of his eyes.

“Don’t,” I said. I stepped to him and he raised his hands like a man listing a truth and the air in front of him whipped. Not hot. Not cold. Something sharper than either. My shirt chattered against my skin and opened in a line down the middle and I looked down and there was a red seam across my chest and belly like a new mouth.

Sarah screamed. “Stop!”

Jack turned to her and I stepped between them and I put my palms to his face. They burned. I pressed anyway. “Look at me,” I said. “Look at me you little bastard. You look at me.”

He looked. Something in him recognized the word bastard and flinched.

“I am your father,” I said. “I don’t know what that means for you. I don’t know if you came here to kill us or to save us or to count us. I don’t care. Listen to me. Do not hurt your mother! Do you hear me? If you hurt her I swear to God!”

His mouth trembled. He made a sound like wind through wire and the cottonwoods shivered and shed a rain of leaves. The coyotes twisted on their ropes and their heads lolled and their black tongues dried in the air.

“I can’t stop it,” he said.

“Then let whatever the hell it is you can’t stop take me, let it take me,” I said. “Leave her.”

“Don’t you dare,” Sarah said. She came and stood under my arm like we could take the heat together and for a second I thought maybe that could be enough. For a second I thought maybe two people saying no would change the call of the sky. Then the soundless hole came down and touched us.

I saw it hit like you see your own hand. It was not light. It was the absence of all the things that make light go. My skin went slick and white and tight. My teeth rang like coins in a glass. I smelled myself cooking and I made a noise a man should not make and Sarah cried my name like it was the last word in the world.

Jack jerked back like he’d been struck. He threw his arms wide and the light bent. It bent around us like we were stones in a stream. It took the corner of the house instead and the siding folded like paper and the fridge in the kitchen burst and milk ran out like a flood and the toaster coughed a black clot of itself onto the floor.

“Go,” I said. “Run.”

“Where,” Sarah said. 

“Into the trees,” I said, and I shoved her and she stumbled and then she ran and I turned back to Jack because if you are any kind of man you turn back to the thing that will ruin you and you make it look at you instead of the person you love.

“Stop,” I said. I was crying. “I am asking you,” I said. “Stop.”

He stood shaking like a boy in a cold lake. “They’re calling me,” he said. “They say come. They say come and bring something back.”

“Don’t go then,” I said.

“I have to,” he said.

“No,” I said.

“I have to,” he said again, and this time it wasn’t his voice. It was something bigger using his mouth to say its small truth. He rose a foot off the ground and the gray grass made a sound like a crowd whispering. The windmill spun in place so fast the tail tore off. The bolted cross on Sarah’s mother’s grave lifted and spun lazy and fell and stuck in the yard point down like a sign nobody could read.

I grabbed his ankle and it burned me to the bone and I kept hold. “You’ll kill her,” I said.

He looked up into the emptiness like a man listens for a train in the night. “They already did,” he said.

My head snapped to the trees and I saw the white of her nightgown. I saw her running between the trunks, not fast enough, never fast enough, and the light licked and she stumbled and got up and ran again and the hem of her gown smoked and some part of me broke into smaller pieces than I could count.

“Jack,” I said.

He bent at the waist like the hinge of him was bone and old and he screamed. A sound like ripping metal. The light faltered. He fell and I fell and I crawled and he crawled and we moved like men on a hot roof. He reached the line of trees and I was behind him and I grabbed the back of his shirt and he tore out of it like a snake leaves it skin and he was gone between trunks like water between fingers.

I found Sarah in a stand of cedar on her knees. Her hair was scorched along one side and her skin had blistered and popped and run and the smell of her undid me. She took my face and put our foreheads together and her eyes were all pupil. “I love you,” she said. “I love him. I love you.”

“I will kill him if I have to,” I said.

“I know,” she said.

“Don’t forgive me,” I said.

“I already did,” she said, and she sagged and I caught her and held her and she breathed a while and then she stopped and I put my mouth to hers and tried to push my breath into her and I tasted blood and burned hair and hope, and I failed.

I don’t remember standing. I don’t remember walking. I remember the clearing at the well house and the net inside and the way it heard me coming.

“Take him,” I said to the net. My voice was a rasp. “If you love him, take him. If you hate us, take him. If you are a machine and this is a transaction, take him and leave us.”

The well house knocked three times and the last one broke the glass in the lanterns on the shelf. The net stirred like a thing glad to see someone. I laughed like a dying man laughs when the joke’s not good enough.

He came out of the cedars naked as a newborn. The skin on his back smoked. His eyes were empty. He stopped five paces from me.

“You killed her,” I said. “Or you brought the thing that did.”

“I tried to stop it,” he said. “I did.”

“You failed,” I said. “So did I.”

He looked at the open door of the well house. He smelled that old sugar wire stink. He shivered like something put a cold finger on the back of his neck. “It’s not a house,” he said.

“What is it.”

“A mouth,” he said.

“Then go into it,” I said.

He looked at me. In those dark eyes I saw the boy learning to walk in the yard and laughing without sound and the boy bringing Sarah dandelions gone to seed and blowing them on her and both of them laughing. I saw the boy lying on a towel in a drawer and not breathing and watching me count my own breaths and lose.

He stepped forward.

“What if it won’t let me back,” he said.

“That’s the point,” I said.

“Daddy,” he said.

“Don’t.”

He nodded and he walked in.

The net lifted. The gray threads rose and draped. He went to his knees. He lay down like a man at last finding a bed. The net slid across him and little sparks ran where it touched like the world was writing his edges down.

I held the door. I held it like it was the only thing that would keep me from flying apart. “Tell me what you are,” I said.

“I am the answer,” he said. “To something you asked.”

The net closed over his face. He did not blink. He did not breathe. He did not look away.

“What did I ask,” I said, but the well house had begun to hum and I couldn’t hear my own voice over it.

The threads tightened. The light went thin and bitter. The air pressed me out the door and I stumbled back and fell and hit my head on the low concrete lip and saw stars in daylight for the first time and when my eyes cleared the net was still again.

The door swung. The beam dropped. It braced against the jamb. I rolled to my side and put my face in the dirt and sobbed like a man who never learned to do it right and now there wasn’t time to learn.

When I finally stood I went into the house and washed Sarah’s face and closed her eyes and braided her hair the way she liked it and I carried her into the yard and I couldn’t dig a grave in that gray sugar grass so I carried her to the apple tree and set her down and went to the shed for the spade and when I came back the air above her was caving in like a hot thunderhead but there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. I started to dig anyway.

I don’t know how long I dug. When the first shadow crossed the ground I looked up and it was not a vulture. It was not a hawk. It was not anything that stays in the sky by effort. The air around it bent like heat over a road. It hovered above the well house, quiet as forgiveness and twice as cruel.

I raised the spade like a toy and the thing did not come down and it did not go away. It hung there waiting, like a stranger at your gate who knows your name and that you’ve run out of prayers.

I thought the solution was more hours and more coffee. It wasn’t.

What finally worked for me was **changing** ***how*** **I studied** instead of just pushing harder. A few things that made a huge difference:

**- Short bursts > marathons.** 15–20 minutes of focused work, short break, repeat. Way less mental burnout.

**- Change your environment.** Library, café, even just a different chair — your brain notices the change and pays more attention.

**- Turn notes into quizzes.** I use Quizuma AI (Google Play) to snap a pic of my notes and get quick, interactive quizzes. It forces me to *recall* instead of just reread, which sticks way better.

**- Teach it to someone (or something).** I explain tricky topics out loud to ChatGPT or a friend. If I can teach it, I actually know it.

**- Pair studying with a trigger.** For me, it’s a specific playlist. First song comes on, phone goes away, brain knows it’s focus time.

I stopped aiming for “study 6 hours straight” and started aiming for “get 3 solid bursts in today.” Some days it’s more, some days less, but it’s consistent — and that’s what matters.

  They were supposed to stay at the beach a week, but neither of them had the heart for it and they decided to come back early. Macon drove. Sarah sat next to him, leaning her head against the side window. Chips of cloudy sky showed through her tangled brown curls.  
  
  Macon wore a formal summer suit, his traveling suit—much more logical for traveling than jeans, he always said. Jeans had those stiff, hard seams and those rivets. Sarah wore a strapless terry beach dress. They might have been returning from two entirely different trips. Sarah had a tan but Macon didn’t. He was a tall, pale, gray-eyed man, with straight fair hair cut close to his head, and his skin was that thin kind that easily burns. He’d kept away from the sun during the middle part of every day.  
  
  Just past the start of the divided highway, the sky grew almost black and several enormous drops spattered the windshield. Sarah sat up straight. “Let’s hope it doesn’t rain,” she said.  
  
  “I don’t mind a little rain,” Macon said.  
  
  Sarah sat back again, but she kept her eyes on the road.  
  
  It was a Thursday morning. There wasn’t much traffic. They passed a pickup truck, then a van all covered with stickers from a hundred scenic attractions. The drops on the windshield grew closer together. Macon switched his wipers on. Tick-swoosh, they went—a lulling sound; and there was a gentle patter on the roof. Every now and then a gust of wind blew up. Rain flattened the long, pale grass at the sides of the road. It slanted across the boat lots, lumberyards, and discount furniture outlets, which already had a darkened look as if here it might have been raining for some time.  
  
  “Can you see all right?” Sarah asked.  
  
  “Of course,” Macon said. “This is nothing.”  
  
  They arrived behind a trailer truck whose rear wheels sent out arcs of spray. Macon swung to the left and passed. There was a moment of watery blindness till the truck had dropped behind. Sarah gripped the dashboard with one hand.  
  
  “I don’t know how you can see to drive,” she said.  
  
  “Maybe you should put on your glasses.”  
  
  “Putting on my glasses would help you to see?”  
  
  “Not me; you,” Macon said. “You’re focused on the windshield instead of the road.”  
  
  Sarah continued to grip the dashboard. She had a broad, smooth face that gave an impression of calm, but if you looked closely you’d notice the tension at the corners of her eyes.  
  
  The car drew in around them like a room. Their breaths fogged the windows. Earlier the air conditioner had been running and now some artificial chill remained, quickly turning dank, carrying with it the smell of mildew. They shot through an underpass. The rain stopped completely for one blank, startling second. Sarah gave a little gasp of relief, but even before it was uttered, the hammering on the roof resumed. She turned and gazed back longingly at the underpass. Macon sped ahead, with his hands relaxed on the wheel.  
  
  “Did you notice that boy with the motorcycle?” Sarah asked. She had to raise her voice; a steady, insistent roaring sound engulfed them.  
  
  “What boy?”  
  
  “He was parked beneath the underpass.”  
  
  “It’s crazy to ride a motorcycle on a day like today,” Macon said. “Crazy to ride one any day. You’re so exposed to the elements.”  
  
  “We could do that,” Sarah said. “Stop and wait it out.”  
  
  “Sarah, if I felt we were in the slightest danger I’d have pulled over long ago.”  
  
  “Well, I don’t know that you would have,” Sarah said.  
  
  They passed a field where the rain seemed to fall in sheets, layers and layers of rain beating down the cornstalks, flooding the rutted soil. Great lashings of water flung themselves at the windshield. Macon switched his wiper blades to high.  
  
  “I don’t know that you really care that much,” Sarah said. “Do you?”  
  
  Macon said, “Care?”  
  
  “I said to you the other day, I said, ‘Macon, now that Ethan’s dead I sometimes wonder if there’s any point to life.’ Do you remember what you answered?”  
  
  “Well, not offhand,” Macon said.  
  
  “You said, ‘Honey, to tell the truth, it never seemed to me there was all that much point to begin with.’ Those were your exact words.”  
  
  “Um . . .”  
  
  “And you don’t even know what was wrong with that.”  
  
  “No, I guess I don’t,” Macon said.  
  
  He passed a line of cars that had parked at the side of the road, their windows opaque, their gleaming surfaces bouncing back the rain in shallow explosions. One car was slightly tipped, as if about to fall into the muddy torrent that churned and raced in the gully. Macon kept a steady speed.  
  
  “You’re not a comfort, Macon,” Sarah said.  
  
  “Honey, I’m trying to be.”  
  
  “You just go on your same old way like before. Your little routines and rituals, depressing habits, day after day. No comfort at all.”  
  
  “Shouldn’t I need comfort too?” Macon asked. “You’re not the only one, Sarah. I don’t know why you feel it’s your loss alone.”  
  
  “Well, I just do, sometimes,” Sarah said.  
  
  They were quiet a moment. A wide lake, it seemed, in the center of the highway crashed against the underside of the car and slammed it to the right. Macon pumped his brakes and drove on.  
  
  “This rain, for instance,” Sarah said. “You know it makes me nervous. Wha  
t harm would it do to wait it out? You’d be showing some concern. You’d be telling me we’re in this together.”  
  
  Macon peered through the windshield, which was streaming so that it seemed marbled. He said, “I’ve got a system, Sarah. You know I drive according to a system.”  
  
  “You and your systems!”  
  
  “Also,” he said, “if you don’t see any point to life, I can’t figure why a rainstorm would make you nervous.”  
  
  Sarah slumped in her seat.  
  
  “Will you look at that!” he said. “A mobile home’s washed clear across that trailer park.”  
  
  “Macon, I want a divorce,” Sarah told him.  
  
  Macon braked and glanced over at her. “What?” he said. The car swerved. He had to face forward again. “What did I say?” he asked. “What did it mean?”  
  
  “I just can’t live with you anymore,” Sarah said.  
  
  Macon went on watching the road, but his nose seemed sharper and whiter, as if the skin of his face had been pulled tight. He cleared his throat. He said, “Honey. Listen. It’s been a hard year. We’ve had a hard time. People who lose a child often feel this way; everybody says so; everybody says it’s a terrible strain on a marriage—”  
  
  “I’d like to find a place of my own as soon as we get back,” Sarah told him.  
  
  “Place of your own,” Macon echoed, but he spoke so softly, and the rain beat so loudly on the roof, it looked as if he were only moving his lips. “Well,” he said. “All right. If that’s what you really want.”  
  
  “You can keep the house,” Sarah said. “You never did like moving.”  
  
  For some reason, it was this that made her finally break down. She turned away sharply. Macon switched his right blinker on. He pulled into a Texaco station, parked beneath the overhang, and cut off the engine. Then he started rubbing his knees with his palms. Sarah huddled in her corner. The only sound was the drumming of rain on the overhang far above them.  
  
  two  
  
  After his wife left him, Macon had thought the house would seem larger. Instead, he felt more crowded. The windows shrank. The ceilings lowered. There was something insistent about the furniture, as if it were pressing in on him.  
  
  Of course Sarah’s personal belongings were gone, the little things like clothes and jewelry. But it emerged that some of the big things were more personal than he’d imagined. There was the drop-leaf desk in the living room, its pigeonholes stuffed with her clutter of torn envelopes and unanswered letters. There was the radio in the kitchen, set to play 98 Rock. (She liked to keep in touch with her students, she used to say in the old days, as she hummed and jittered her way around the breakfast table.) There was the chaise out back where she had sunbathed, planted in the only spot that got any sun at all. He looked at the flowered cushions and marveled at how an empty space could be so full of a person—her faint scent of coconut oil that always made him wish for a piña colada; her wide, gleaming face inscrutable behind dark glasses; her compact body in the skirted swimsuit she had tearfully insisted on buying after her fortieth birthday. Threads of her exuberant hair showed up at the bottom of the sink. Her shelf in the medicine cabinet, stripped, was splashed with drops of liquid rouge in a particularly plummy shade that brought her instantly to Macon’s mind. He had always disapproved of her messiness but now those spills seemed touching, like colorful toys left on the floor after a child has gone to bed.  
  
  The house itself was medium-sized, unexceptional to look at, standing on a street of such houses in an older part of Baltimore. Heavy oak trees hung over it, shading it from the hot summer sun but also blocking breezes. The rooms inside were square and dim. All that remained in Sarah’s closet was a brown silk sash hanging on a hook; in her bureau drawers, lint balls and empty perfume bottles. Their son’s old room was neatly made up, as sleek as a room in a Holiday Inn. Some places, the walls gave off a kind of echo. Still, Macon noticed he had a tendency to hold his arms close to his body, to walk past furniture sideways as if he imagined the house could barely accommodate him. He felt too tall. His long, clumsy feet seemed unusually distant. He ducked his head in doorways.  
  
  Now was his chance to reorganize, he told himself. He was struck by an incongruous little jolt of interest. The fact was that running a house required some sort of system, and Sarah had never understood that. She was the sort of woman who stored her flatware intermingled. She thought nothing of running a dishwasher with only a handful of forks stacked inside. Macon found that distressing. He was opposed to dishwashers in general; he believed they wasted energy. Energy saving was a hobby of his, you might say.  
  
  He started keeping the kitchen sink filled at all times, adding some chlorine bleach for disinfectant. As he finished using each dish, he dropped it in. On alternate days he pulled the plug and sprayed everything with very hot water. Then he stacked the rinsed dishes in the empty dishwasher—which had become, under his new system, a gigantic storage area.  
  
  When he hunkered over the sink to let the spray attachment run, he often had the feeling that Sarah was watching. He sensed that if he slid his eyes just slightly to the left, he would find her with her arms folded across her chest, her head tipped and her full, curved lips meditatively pursed. At first glance she was simply studying his procedure; at second glance (he knew) she was laughing at him. There was a secret little gleam in her eyes that he was all too familiar with. “I see,” she would say, nodding at some lengthy explanation of his; then he’d look up and catch the gleam and the telltale tuck at one corner of her mouth.  
  
  In this vision of her—if you could call it a vision, considering that he never did glance over at her—she was wearing a bright blue dress from the early days of their marriage. He had no idea when she had given that dress up, but certainly it was years and years ago. He almost felt that Sarah was a ghost—that she was dead. In a way (he thought, turning off the faucet), she was dead, that young, vivid Sarah from their first enthusiastic apartment on Cold Spring Lane. When he tried to recall those days, any image of Sarah was altered by the fact that she had left him. When he pictured their introduction—back when they were barely out of childhood—it seemed nothing more than the beginning of their parting. When she had looked up at him that first night and rattled the ice cubes in her paper cup, they were already moving toward their last edgy, miserable year together, toward those months when anything either of them said was wrong, toward that sense of narrowly missed connections. They were like people who run to meet, holding out their arms, but their aim is wrong; they pass each other and keep running. It had all amounted to nothing, in the end. He gazed down at the sink, and the warmth from the dishes drifted gently up into his face.  
  
  Well, you have to carry on. You have to carry on. He decided to switch his shower from morning to night. This showed adaptability, he felt—some freshness of spirit. While he showered he let the water collect in the tub, and he stalked around in noisy circles, sloshing the day’s dirty clothes underfoot. Later he wrung out the clothes and hung them on hangers to dry. Then he dressed in tomorrow’s underwear so he wouldn’t have to launder any pajamas. In fact, his only real laundry was a load of towels and sheets once a week—just two towels, but quite a lot of sheets. This was because he had developed a system that enabled him to sleep in clean sheets every night without the trouble of bed changing. He’d been proposing the system to Sarah for years, but she was so set in her ways. What he did was strip the mattress of all linens, replacing them with a giant sort of envelope made from one of the seven sheets he had folded and stitched together on the sewing machine. He thought of this invention as a Macon Leary Body Bag. A body bag required no tucking in, was unmussable, easily changeable, and the perfect weight for summer nights. In winter he would have to devise something warmer, but he couldn’t think of winter yet. He was barely making it from one day to the next as it was.  
  
  At moments—while he was skidding on the mangled clothes in the bathtub or struggling into his body bag on the naked, rust-stained mattress—he realized that he might be carrying things too far.  
He couldn’t explain why, either. He’d always had a fondness for method, but not what you would call a mania. Thinking then of Sarah’s lack of method, he wondered if that had got out of hand now too. Maybe all these years, they’d been keeping each other on a reasonable track. Separated, demagnetized somehow, they wandered wildly off course. He pictured Sarah’s new apartment, which he had never seen, as chaotic to the point of madness, with sneakers in the oven and the sofa heaped with china. The mere thought of it upset him. He looked gratefully at his own surroundings.  
  
  Most of his work was done at home; otherwise he might not have cared so about the mechanics of the household. He had a little study in the spare room off the kitchen. Seated in a stenographer’s chair, tapping away at a typewriter that had served him through four years of college, he wrote a series of guidebooks for people forced to travel on business. Ridiculous, when you thought about it: Macon hated travel. He careened through foreign territories on a desperate kind of blitz—squinching his eyes shut and holding his breath and hanging on for dear life, he sometimes imagined—and then settled back home with a sigh of relief to produce his chunky, passport-sized paperbacks. Accidental Tourist in France. Accidental Tourist in Germany. In Belgium. No author’s name, just a logo: a winged armchair on the cover.  
  
  He covered only the cities in these guides, for people taking business trips flew into cities and out again and didn’t see the countryside at all. They didn’t see the cities, for that matter. Their concern was how to pretend they had never left home. What hotels in Madrid boasted king-sized Beautyrest mattresses? What restaurants in Tokyo offered Sweet’n’Low? Did Amsterdam have a McDonald’s? Did Mexico City have a Taco Bell? Did any place in Rome serve Chef Boyardee ravioli? Other travelers hoped to discover distinctive local wines; Macon’s readers searched for pasteurized and homogenized milk.  
  
  As much as he hated the travel, he loved the writing—the virtuous delights of organizing a disorganized country, stripping away the inessential and the second-rate, classifying all that remained in neat, terse paragraphs. He cribbed from other guidebooks, seizing small kernels of value and discarding the rest. He spent pleasurable hours dithering over questions of punctuation. Righteously, mercilessly, he weeded out the passive voice. The effort of typing made the corners of his mouth turn down, so that no one could have guessed how much he was enjoying himself. I am happy to say, he pecked out, but his face remained glum and intense. I am happy to say that it’s possible now to buy Kentucky Fried Chicken in Stockholm.Pita bread, too , he added as an afterthought. He wasn’t sure how it had happened, but lately pita had grown to seem as American as hot dogs.Of course you’re managing,” his sister told him over the phone. “Did I say you weren’t? But at least you could have let us know. Three weeks, it’s been! Sarah’s been gone three weeks and I only hear about it today. And by chance, at that. If I hadn’t asked to speak to her, would you ever have told us she’d left you?”  
  
  “She didn’t leave me,” Macon said. “I mean it’s not the way you make it sound. We discussed it like adults and decided to separate, that’s all. The last thing I need is my family gathered around me saying, ‘Oh, poor Macon, how could Sarah do this to you—’ ”  
  
  “Why would I say that?” Rose asked. “Everybody knows the Leary men are difficult to live with.”  
  
  “Oh,” Macon said.  
  
  “Where is she?”  
  
  “She’s got a place downtown,” he said. “And look,” he added, “you don’t have to bend over backwards, either, and go asking her to dinner or something. She does have a family of her own. You’re supposed to take my side in this.”  
  
  “I thought you didn’t want us to take sides.”  
  
  “No, no, I don’t. I mean you shouldn’t take her side, is what I’m trying to say.”  
  
  “When Charles’s wife got her divorce,” Rose said, “we went on having her to dinner every Christmas, just like always. Remember?”  
  
  “I remember,” Macon said wearily. Charles was their oldest brother.  
  
  “I suppose she’d still be coming, if she hadn’t got remarried to someone so far away.”  
  
  “What? If her husband had been a Baltimore man you’d have gone on inviting them both?”  
  
  “She and Porter’s wife and Sarah used to sit around the kitchen— this was before Porter’s wife got her divorce—and they’d go on and on about the Leary men. Oh, it was the Leary men this, the Leary men that: how they always had to have everything just so, always so well thought out beforehand, always clamping down on the world as if they really thought they could keep it in line. The Leary men! I can hear them still. I had to laugh: One Thanksgiving Porter and June were getting ready to leave, back when their children were small, and June was heading toward the door with the baby in her arms and Danny hanging onto her coat and this load of toys and supplies when Porter called out, ‘Halt!’ and started reading from one of those cash-register tapes that he always writes his lists on: blanket, bottles, diaper bag, formula out of the fridge . . . June just looked over at the other two and rolled her eyes.”  
  
  “Well, it wasn’t such a bad idea,” Macon said, “when you consider June.”  
  
  “No, and you notice it was alphabetical, too,” Rose said. “I do think alphabetizing helps to sort things out a little.”  
  
  Rose had a kitchen that was so completely alphabetized, you’d find the allspice next to the ant poison. She was a fine one to talk about the Leary men.  
  
  “At any rate,” she said. “Has Sarah been in touch since she left?”  
  
  “She’s come by once or twice. Once, actually,” Macon said. “For things she needed.”  
  
  “What kind of things?”  
  
  “Well, a double boiler. Things like that.”  
  
  “It’s an excuse, then,” Rose said promptly. “She could get a double boiler at any dimestore.”  
  
  “She said she liked ours.”  
  
  “She was checking to see how you’re doing. She still cares. Did you talk at all?”  
  
  “No,” Macon said, “I just handed her the double boiler. Also that gadget that unscrews bottle tops.”  
  
  “Oh, Macon. You might have asked her in.”  
  
  “I was scared she’d say no,” he said.  
  
  There was a silence. “Well. Anyhow,” Rose said finally.  
  
  “But I’m getting along!”  
  
  “Yes, of course you are,” she told him.  
  
  Then she said she had something in the oven and hung up.  
  
  Macon went over to his study window. It was a hot day in early July, the sky so blue it made his eyes ache. He rested his forehead against the glass and stared out at the yard, keeping his hands stuffed deep in the rear pockets of his khakis. Up in one of the oak trees, a bird sang what sounded like the first three notes of “My Little Gypsy Sweetheart.” “Slum . . . ber . . . on . . .” it sang. Macon wondered if even this moment would become, one day, something he looked back upon wistfully. He couldn’t imagine it; he couldn’t think of any period bleaker than this in all his life, but he’d noticed how time had a way of coloring things. That bird, for instance, had such a pure, sweet, piercing voice.  
  
  He turned away from the window, covered his typewriter, and left the room.  
  
  He didn’t eat real meals anymore. When he was hungry he drank a glass of milk, or he spooned a bit of ice cream directly from the carton. After the smallest snack he felt overfed and heavy, but he noticed when he dressed in the mornings that he seemed to be losing weight. His shirt collar stood out around his neck. The vertical groove between his nose and mouth had deepened so that he had trouble shaving it. His hair, which Sarah used to cut for him, jutted over his forehead like a shelf. And something had caused his lower lids to droop. He used to have narrow gray slits of eyes; now they were wide and startled. Could this be a sign of malnutrition?  
  
  Breakfast: Breakfast was your most important meal. He hooked up the percolator and the electric skillet to the clock radio on his bedroom windowsill. Of course he was asking for food poisoning, letting two raw eggs wait all night at room temperature, but once he’d changed menus there was no problem. You had to be flexible about these matters. He was awakened now by the smell of fresh coffee and hot buttered popcorn, and he could partake of both without getting out of bed. Oh, he was managing fine, just fine. All things considered.  
  
  But his nights were terrible.  
  
  It wasn’t that he had trouble getting to sleep in the first place. That was easy. He’d watch TV till his eyes burned; then he’d climb the stairs. He would start the shower running and spread his clothes in the tub. At times he thought of skipping this part, except there was such a danger in falling behind with your system. So he carried out each step: hanging the laundry, setting up the breakfast things, flossing his teeth. He couldn’t go to bed without flossing his teeth. For some reason, Sarah had found this irritating. If Macon were condemned to death, she’d said once, and they told him he’d be executed by firing squad at dawn, he would no doubt still insist on flossing the night before. Macon, after thinking it over, had agreed. Yes, of course he would. Hadn’t he flossed while in the depths of pneumonia? In the hospital with gallstones? In a motel the night his son was killed? He checked his teeth in the mirror. They were never entirely white, in spite of all his care. And now it seemed his skin was taking on a yellowish cast as well.  
  
  He turned off the lights, moved the cat over, helped the dog up onto the bed. The dog was a Welsh corgi, very shortlegged, but he did love to sleep in a bed, and so every night he stood erect and propped his elbows on the mattress and gazed at Macon expectantly till Macon gave him a boost. Then they’d all three settle themselves. Macon slipped into his envelope, the cat fitted her shape to the warm spot under his arm, and the dog plopped down near his feet. Then Macon closed his eyes and drifted off.  
  
  But eventually he found himself conscious of his dreams—not borne along by them but tediously constructing them, quibbling over details. When it dawned on him that he was awake, he would open his eyes and squint at the clock radio. But it was only one a.m. At the latest, two. There were all those hours still to be survived.  
  
  His brain buzzed with little worries. Had he left the back door unlocked? Forgotten to put the milk away? Made out a check for his bank balance instead of his gas bill? He remembered all in a rush that he’d opened a can of V-8 juice and then put the can in the icebox. Oxidation of the metal seams! Resulting in lead poisoning!  
  
  The worries changed, grew deeper. He wondered what had gone wrong with his marriage. Sarah had been his first and only girlfriend; now he thought he should have practiced on someone else beforehand. During the twenty years of their marriage there’d been moments—there  
’d been months—when he didn’t feel they had really formed a unit the way couples were supposed to. No, they’d stayed two distinct people, and not always even friends. Sometimes they’d seemed more like rivals, elbowing each other, competing over who was the better style of person. Was it Sarah, haphazard, mercurial? Was it Macon, methodical and steady?  
  
  When Ethan was born, he only brought out more of their differences. Things they had learned to ignore in each other resurfaced. Sarah never got their son on any kind of schedule at all, was lax and unconcerned. And Macon (oh, he knew it, he admitted it) had been so intent on preparing him for every eventuality that he hadn’t had time to enjoy him. Ethan at two, at four floated up into his vision as clearly as a color film projected upon the bedroom ceiling. A chortling, sunny little boy, he’d been, with Macon a stooped shape above him wringing his hands. Macon had been fierce in teaching him, at age six, how to swing a bat; it would have wrenched his soul to have Ethan chosen last for any team. “Why?” Sarah had asked. “If he’s chosen last, he’s chosen last. Let it be, why don’t you.” Let it be! Life was so full of things you couldn’t do anything about; you had to avert what you could. She laughed when Macon spent one fall collecting Wacky Packs, which had these jokey stickers inside that Ethan liked to plaster his bedroom door with. He’d have more than anyone in the whole third grade, Macon vowed. Long after Ethan lost interest, Macon was still doggedly bringing them home. He knew it was absurd, but still, there was this one last sticker they had not yet managed to get hold of . . .  
  
  Ethan went away to camp when he was twelve—a year ago, almost exactly. Most boys started earlier, but Macon had kept delaying it. Why have a child at all, he asked Sarah, if you were only going to ship him off to some godforsaken spot in Virginia? By the time he finally gave in, Ethan was in the top age group—a tall blond sprout of a boy with an open, friendly face and an endearing habit of bouncing on the balls of his feet when he was nervous.  
  
  Don’t think about it.  
  
  He was murdered in a Burger Bonanza his second night at camp. It was one of those deaths that make no sense—the kind where the holdup man has collected his money and is free to go but decides, instead, first to shoot each and every person through the back of the skull.  
  
  Ethan wasn’t even supposed to be there. He had snuck away from camp with a cabinmate, who waited outside as a lookout.  
  
  Blame the camp for not supervising. Blame Burger Bonanza for poor security. Blame the cabinmate for not going in too and altering, perhaps, what took place. (Lookout for what, for God’s sake?) Blame Sarah for allowing Ethan to leave home; blame Macon for agreeing; blame even (hell, yes) Ethan. Blame Ethan for wanting to attend that camp and for sneaking off from it, and for entering Burger Bonanza like some headstrong fool while a holdup was in progress. Blame him for so meekly moving to the kitchen with the others, for placing his hands flat against the wall as he was ordered and no doubt bouncing slightly on the balls of his feet . . .  
  
  Don’t think about it.  
  
  The director of the camp, not wanting to break the news on the phone, had driven to Baltimore to tell them in person. Then he’d driven them back to Virginia. Macon often recalled that director. Jim, his name was, Jim Robinson or maybe Robertson—a burly, white-whiskered man with a crew cut, wearing a suit coat, as if in respect, over a Redskins T-shirt. He’d seemed uncomfortable with silence and did his best to fill it with abrupt little fragments of chitchat. Macon hadn’t listened, or he’d thought he hadn’t; but now all the fragments came back to him. How Jim’s mother had been a Baltimorean herself, born the year Babe Ruth was playing for the Orioles. How Jim’s tomato plants had been acting queerly, producing only tiny green marbles that fell off the vines before they ripened. How Jim’s wife was terrified of driving in reverse and avoided any situation that required it. Macon gave a lot of thought to that now, lying in his bed at night. Could you really drive a car without reversing? What about at intersections, where a bus driver pokes his head out his window and asks you to roll on back a few yards so he can turn? Would she refuse? Macon imagined her, staunch and defiant, glaring straight in front of her and pretending not to notice. The driver escalating into curses, horns blowing, other drivers shouting, “Aw, lady!” It made a nice picture. He kept it firmly in mind.  
  
  Finally he would sit up and wriggle out of his sheet. The dog, sighing, roused himself and dropped off the bed to pad downstairs behind him. The floorboards were cool underfoot, the kitchen linoleum cooler still; there was a glow from the refrigerator as Macon poured himself a glass of milk. He went to the living room and turned on the TV. Generally some black-and-white movie was running—men in suits and felt hats, women with padded shoulders. He didn’t try to follow the plot. He took small, steady sips of milk, feeling the calcium traveling to his bones. Hadn’t he read that calcium cures insomnia? He absently stroked the cat, who had somehow crept into his lap. It was much too hot to have a cat in his lap, especially this one—a loose-strung, gray tweed female who seemed made of some unusually dense substance. And the dog, most often, would be lying on top of his feet. “It’s just you and me, old buddies,” Macon would tell them. The cat made a comma of sweat across his bare thighs.  
  
  At last he would slip out from under the animals and turn off the TV. He would put his glass in the chlorine solution in the kitchen sink. He would climb the stairs. He’d stand at the bedroom window looking over the neighborhood—black branches scrawled on a purple night sky, a glimmer of white clapboard here and there, occasionally a light. Macon always took comfort if he found a light. Someone else had trouble sleeping too, he assumed. He didn’t like to consider any other possibility—a party, for instance, or a heart-to-heart talk with old friends. He preferred to believe that someone else was on his own, sitting up wide awake fending off his thoughts. That made him feel much better. He returned to his bed. He lay down. He closed his eyes and without even trying, he dropped off the edge into sleep.

  Sarah telephoned Macon and asked if she could come get the navy blue rug from the dining room.  
  
  “Navy blue rug,” Macon repeated. (He was stalling for time.)  
  
  “I wouldn’t mention it except you never liked it,” Sarah told him. “You said it was a mistake to have a rug where people were eating.”  
  
  Yes, he had said that. A crumb catcher, he’d said. Unsanitary. Then why did he feel this sudden, wrenching need to keep the rug for himself?  
  
  “Macon, are you there?”  
  
  “Yes, I’m here.”  
  
  “So would you mind if I came and got it?”  
  
  “No, I guess not.”  
  
  “Oh, good. My apartment has these bare floors and you’ve no idea how—”  
  
  She would stop by for the rug and he’d invite her in. He’d offer her a glass of sherry. They would sit on the couch with their sherry and he would say, “Sarah, have you missed me?” Or no, he’d say, “I’ve missed you, Sarah.”  
  
  She would say . . .  
  
  She said, “I thought I’d drop over Saturday morning, if that’s convenient.”  
  
  But people don’t drink sherry in the morning.  
  
  And besides: He wouldn’t even be here then. “I leave for England tomorrow afternoon,” he said.  
  
  “Oh, is it time for England again?”  
  
  “Maybe you could come this evening.”  
  
  “No, my car’s in the shop.”  
  
  “Your car? What’s wrong with it?”  
  
  “Well, I was driving along and . . . you know that little red light on the lefthand side of the dash?”  
  
  “What, the oil pressure light?”  
  
  “Yes, and so I thought, ‘Well, I’ll be late for the dentist if I stop and see to it now and anyway, the car does seem to be running all right, so—’ ”

You didn’t just kill my son; you killed me; you killed my husband.

I got the chance to ask her out on a coffee date. She's a single mom of 4 (2 sa una, 2 sa dalawa--both broken off) and has 3 jobs to support the kiddos. 

She's a gym rat like me and I had the courage to ask her out. 

I thought she was just being friendly but she hooked me in: looks, personality, wit, and mindset. 

The thing with me is that I'm an only child and my parents are both gone. I do admit na I want to be with her because I know na she deserves to be given the care, adoration, and love that she longs for. 

The thing is, I don't know how to be that guy kahit gustong gusto ko siya.

Don't get me wrong, I'm earning well enough to support my hobbies, likes, and wants. I only have 2 cats that I cherish more than myself. 😆

But the more that I get to talk to her since we're both night owls, the more she hooks and sinks me in. 

I see her as someone to build a future with and be able to provide for them (I don't mind naman since Mama was a single parent for a long time, kaya I know the hardship of the receiving end).

I made my intention towards her na I want to court her out properly ha! And would love to get to know her family and kids. It's just that I don't know how to.

In all honesty, I want to court her out properly kasi I know naman na she deserves it. :(",3,1754768125.0,MayConfessionAko,2,1.0,False

Hello from Mindanao! I'm planning for a solo trip sa long weekend. would like to ask your insights re this itinerary. i'm a slightly introverted, and awkward woman medyo kulbaan ko sa mga socialization na setting, so i'd prefer going to somewhere more quiet and medyo away from the crowd, but tabian sad ko kung masugdan. i love nature, food, and coffee. very noob scuba diver, and started learning to freedive for this very trip. i heard Duma is a haven for art, literature and music enthusiasts, so i'm also looking for spaces na naay inana hehe.

I've been to siquijor before, but balikan lang nako ang places na wa nako na adtoan before. Dauin, and Dumaguete are completely new para sa ako.

a few questions:

1. naa ra bay masakyan/transpo from dumaguete port to dauin at around 7pm ish? was planning na mutabok from siquijor mga 5-6pm na.
2. how much usually ang fare sa trike in duma?

My wife, 53F, of 5 years invited and went out for coffee/dessert with a divorced man from her singing group. They hugged, she gave him a small gift, they were out a few hours and he paid.

The 2 main issues are first she didn't tell me she was going out with a man and second this seemed like a date. My wife has been in this ethnic singing group with 8 women and 3 men. They practiced weekly and sang every few months at places like festivals. This is purely amateur, no money and no one has serious training in singing.

When she said she was going out, I asked with who. She said a friend. I asked what friend. She said someone from her singing group (mostly women). I asked again which friend. She responded again a friend from singing. I have met all of the group members, but I don't remember all their names. Feels very odd that she wouldn't give a name in advance.

Second, this seems like the prototypical first date. Coffee and dessert. She about skipped to the car excited and was dressed very nicely (although this is normal when she goes out). The group broke up several months ago over personal disagreements and before this she made each person a small item with cultural meanings as well as memento of their group. After the fact, she told me it was to give him this gift so he could be reminded of the group. The same group, he never wants to see again. So why a memento?

This guy is divorced and dated one of the other women in the group. Not a big leap to guess he was there to meet women. Singing is heavily dominated by female numbers. 

It feels odd to give him this gift to a group he doesn't want any part of, odd to do this 1 on 1, odd to do it over coffee/dessert, odd to be out for a few hours, odd not to tell me who it was, etc. I've been divorced once from a cheater and it feels exactly the same. Every part of it feels the same. She insists it is just a friend and wanted to give him this gift. Also, this group all speaks a foreign language so I have no idea what is said when we are together or over texts.",1,1754768054.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
1mly3k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1mly3k2/i_stole_cash_and_called_1900_numbers_from_the/,I stole cash and called 1-900 numbers from the back office of the coffee shop I worked at.,"My first job was a McDonald's at 15, that lasted a year. My second job was at a coffee shop, this is where the criminal mastermind was born.

Now, I really enjoyed working at this coffee shop. The job was so different than Micky D's, and I learned how to make cool exotic coffees like cappuccino and latte. I loved foaming the milks and mixing up all the concoctions. I'm really good at customer service so the regulars loved me and the family that owned the place were super nice. Obviously the random cakes and baked goods were always awesome too! 

Anyways, one of the family members worked alot so we were familiar and I generally understood her schedule. While we worked one day I snuck her key ring away with me for lunch (she left it under the register every day), I went to the hardware store at the end of the shopping center and made a copy of the keys to the front door and the office.

I kept these keys for a few days in my school bag, thrilled beyond anything that I had this idea and now had these keys. I literally thought I was on the verge of being the next 007 super spy with my superior intelligence already so advanced at 16 years old. Mind you, I really didn't have any particular plan for what I wanted to do in the store, I just wanted to break in after hours because I thought it would be cool and fun. 
Finally one night after we closed, I walked across the parking lot and waited for the boss to lock up and leave. I waited for what felt like enough time then went up and let myself right into the store!!! I went back to the office so I could snoop through everything and in the bottom file cabinet drawer they had a small cash bank!  Stacks of bills and rolls/bags of coins. I immediately took like 50 dollars mixed from all the stacks thinking there's no way it could be missed. 

Then, as I was delicately nosing through everything else around the office, looking around the phone I started thinking about all the late night commercials talking about ""do you want hot times, call 1-900-Sexy-Body and talk to live girls who want you bad.""   I was like, let's do it! I went and grabbed one of those penny saver classified newspapers from the front and started calling these numbers. I talked to a couple girls for maybe 20 seconds each and kept hanging up on them because I was so shy, and so it turns out, gay.

After all this I put everything back how it was and carefully locked back up and went home. I worked a few more shifts and never heard anything and no one said anything about missing money or phone charges.  So after about a week I went and did it all again.  

Over the next maybe 2 months, I did this about 5 times total, I have no idea how much money I took or how many of those numbers I called (I tried a couple more times and even tried a dude hotline but always hung up pretty quickly).

After several weeks I decided I didn't want this job anymore. I hated washing the dishes everyday and the coffee started to get boring. Not to mention I've been leisurely robbing this place blind and racking up a huge phone bill! I quit soon after and had an amicable leaving.

I took a fast food job in the same shopping center which I ended up working at for 2 years. About 2 months after I had quit, I decided to grab a drink at this coffee shop before work. As I walked up to the door I could see there was a large printed sign that essentially says ""we've been robbed and we don't know when/how, if you have any information please call xxx"" I turned around so fast and practically ran to my fast food job nearby, I was terrified. Practically in a panic attack. I just knew they would trace it back to me and I'd be in prison.

Turns out they never did find me, but when they closed the next year I was definite that I was the cause and I felt horrible like human garbage. Anyways I'm much older and wiser now and I'm ever thankful that this was a time before cameras were everywhere. I still feel a bit guilty and I'll certainly never do it again, but sometimes I can still feel that tinge of excitement that I was absolutely bathing in during my weeks in organized crime.

I want us to feel that magnetic and emotional pull — like the minute we lock eyes, the world becomes outside noise.

I’m 31, 5’4, Japanese-American, HWP (height weight proportionate), with long dark brown hair and bangs, and dark brown almond-shaped eyes. I’m very in touch with my feminine side. I’m based in Los Angeles and work as an instructional assistant at an elementary school while pursuing my Early Childhood Education Units, building a meaningful career in education.

A bit about me: I take care of myself and often get mistaken for being in my twenties (not going to lie, it’s fun). I love coastal drives, bookstores, traveling, writing (currently working on a horror-romance novel), and losing myself in synthwave — right now, Chromance by Kalax is on repeat. My favorite 2000s film are *The Girl Next Door* (2004), and *Freaky Friday* (2003) is one of my ultimate comfort movies. I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink minimally.

I love good morning texts, consistency, honesty, and emotional depth. I want the kind of romance where you pick me up at my door with flowers, and as the night ends, you’re already asking, “So, when can I see you again?” No guessing games. No one left wondering or waiting.

I want a romance that makes my heart race at 100 miles per hour, where we laugh endlessly, trust and respect each other fully, and I wipe the lipstick off your lips after every kiss. I want to feel the spark, fire, and passion — as well as the stability and calmness that comes from knowing we’re truly right for each other. I want a romance that burns so bright all because it feels so right.

I want us to feel like we’re 21 again — full of excitement and possibility — yet with the emotional stability of adults who know who they are. I’m looking for someone who isn’t just a fantasy, but feels like my best friend and someone I’ve known my whole life. Tattoos and leather jackets are a bonus; I have three tattoos myself. Together, we could be like James Dean and Audrey Hepburn — timeless, magnetic, unforgettable.

I’m looking for a man who is in touch with his masculine side but is highly emotionally intelligent and respectful. I like a guy with a bit of a bad boy edge — tattoos, leather jackets, maybe a motorcycle — but who is still a respectful, grounded, and decent man at heart. Someone who always follows through with what he says, has his own life, passions, and goals, and takes care of himself physically and emotionally. **Between 30–40**, tall, stable, **obviously single**, and carrying a dark, intriguing edge. You don’t smoke (weed, cigarettes, vaping, etc.) or use drugs. You treat wait staff with the same kindness and respect you’d show anyone else. **Monogamy only**.

I don’t have children, and I’d prefer you don’t either — but I would love to have kids someday, so it’s important that we’re on the same page about marriage and the future. Tattoos, cars and/or motorcycles, leather jackets, and basic common sense and literacy are a HUGE bonus!

Picture us: riding off into the sunset on your motorcycle, laughing while we run errands together like it’s our own private inside joke, or sitting quietly at an overlook watching the city lights below — knowing we’re exactly where we belong. And maybe later that night, we’re back under the neon glow of Los Angeles, kissing like the whole world has disappeared. Beyond that, we’ll explore LA together — from hidden coffee shops to city lights and coastal adventures — making memories in every corner of this city.

Note: I’d prefer if you were in Los Angeles or Orange County — but if you’re in the US, you're absolutely welcome to reach out. If you’re in another country, it might be harder to make this work.

If you feel that spark reading this, send me a thoughtful message — and yes, include a photo. Chemistry matters, and I want to know if we’ll light up the screen together.",2,1754767962.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.75,False

I posted this story on a few different sub reddits but they keep getting removed so I hope they’ll let this one stay up. But I’m a 17 year old girl who has been dealing with debilitating stomach problems for about 3 years now. They started in March of 2023 and are still going strong. I’ve struggled with stomach problems since I was little, but nothing like this. What I was struggling with before was just occasional nervous diarrhea/ constipation and feeling nauseas, typical IBS stuff. In March of 2023 that all changed. I had gone to bed one night and woke up constipated, didn’t think much of it as it had happened to me before and usually an iced coffee would do the trick and clean me out and I’d be better again. This time, when I went to drink my coffee, it didn’t clean me out. Instead, it made me feel incredibly sick like I was going to pass out. I felt like it gave me diarrhea, but I couldn’t get the diarrhea out of me. I went to the bathroom a few times that day, but each time only a little bit would come out and I didn’t feel satisfied at all. This continued on for about a week until a nurse friend of my mom’s recommended doing a miralax clean out. I took the miralax, shat out an entire ecosystem, and thought that would be the end of it. Spoiler alert I was wrong!! After that day, it went right back to the same cycle of feeling sick because I couldn’t evacuate myself fully. I began to feel super bloated, and even laxatives began not working. I went to a gastroenterologist to try and figure out what was wrong (summer of 2023 at this point) and she just told me to take laxitives every day and see a counselor. She also told me to do a SITZ test(I think that’s what it’s called) where I swallowed some rubber bands and they did x rays to track how it moved through my system to see if I had slow motility. Everything came back normal as I was taking 4 senna tablets and one dose of miralax per day. It helped in some sense, for the most part I was feeling “better” because I was having crazy diarrhea and I felt less full, but even then, The diarrhea felt “stuck” inside of me. I was (and still am)  spending an hour on the toilet waiting for it to fall out of me because when I pushed nothing would happen. Eventually the gastroenterologist ended up retiring and wound up with some pretty bad reviews online, so I switched to another gastro. This was now November of 2023, this gastro assigned me to do a stool sample , which came back normal , and do an anorectal manometry. The anorectal manometry  results said that I wasn’t using the right muscles to push. Oh I forgot to mention that the doctor also put me on linzess which I was taking at the time, I started out on the lowest dose which I believe is 55 mg and I’m now taking 105 mg. It’s helping because it’s a stool softener so it makes it easier to fall out, but I’m still having the issue when I push nothing happens, it’s not addressing the root cause. By then the doctors were all telling me that it was just IBS and the thing I could do was just a diet change. But no matter what I ate I still felt the same, didn’t matter if it was a bag of chips with some kfc or a super balanced meal with salad and protein and fiber. I also do consider myself to have a pretty good diet already, I try to limit my junk food and I eat a lot of vegetables and keep up with my fiber intake. One doctor suggested pelvic floor therapy would help, so I was doing that for about 5 months and didn’t feel any improvement whatsoever. Then also did biofeedback that I just finished today. I did 6 sessions coupled with some pelvic floor therapy and still no results. The pelvic floor therapist said it could be a motility problem but I’m not sure. The biofeedback machine I also saw isn’t always super accurate so I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m also leaving for my freshman year of college in 2 weeks, and I’m worried about how this will affect me while I’m away from home and from my doctors. I know this was super lengthy and might not make a lot of sense but really any help or advice is appreciated. I might edit it and try to clean it up so it makes more chronological sense. I’m just really tired of dealing with this it’s been almost 3 years now and I’m in so much pain and discomfort. Thank you guys🥹",2,1754767776.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

My suit feels tight, the fabric of my skirt too stiff as it rubs against my legs. I tug at the hem as I follow my supervisor, Martin, down the polished hallway of the office building. The air smells like expensive coffee and something faintly floral. I wish I could just blend into the walls.

“You’ve got this, Nichole,” Martin’s voice pulls me from my thoughts. He’s so calm, so effortlessly confident. I can’t help but admire the way he walks like he’s in charge of the world. Meanwhile, I’m just hoping I don’t spill my water or, god forbid, trip over my own heels.

I glance down at my phone, just to check the time, even though I’ve already checked it five times in the last ten minutes. We’re supposed to meet with a potential investor for one of our upcoming projects a new mixed-use development that’s going to transform an entire neighborhood. A huge deal. The kind of deal that could make or break my career. No pressure, right?

Martin pauses by the elevator, giving me a quick glance over his shoulder. “You’re looking sharp. Remember, you’re here to learn, not just to impress.”

I swallow hard, the words not doing anything to settle my nerves. ""Right, learning. Got it.""

The elevator dings, and the doors slide open. Inside, I cling to the railing like it’s my lifeline. I know I’m overthinking it, but the thought of sitting across from someone important, trying to sound like I belong, is like trying to pretend I’m a grown-up when I still feel like a kid in a suit. My heart beats a little faster when I imagine how I’ll sound. I’ll probably end up saying something stupid.

When we reach the restaurant a sleek, modern spot with high ceilings and a cool ambiance I step out and let the cool air hit my face, hoping it’ll calm me down. I catch a glimpse of the investor, you, before Martin even says anything. You’re sharp-dressed sitting at a corner booth, surrounded by glossy black leather chairs. You look exactly like what I imagine when I think of an investor: confident, decisive, the kind of person who could probably tell if you were faking it in a second.

Martin waves and gestures to me. “This is Nichole, our newest designer. She’s just starting out, but she’s got a lot of potential.”

I smile, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks. “Hi, it’s nice to meet you.” My voice comes out a little higher than usual.

1mlxuut,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mlxuut/slice_of_shelis_life/,Slice of Sheli's life,"Sector 42-D, Orbit of Jarna Prime, Docked at Diplomatic Habitat Zhree – Aboard the VSS Caspian\*

Sheli's ears twitched before her eyes opened. Not from a noise—Zhree’s orbit was unusually quiet today—but because the temperature had dropped exactly two degrees in their cabin.

Ed messed with the thermostat again.

Her tail flicked once under the blanket before she rolled onto her back and sighed through her nose. One arm draped over her eyes, the soft-furred edge of her palm blocking the neon strip lighting bleeding through the half-drawn curtain.

He does it on purpose, she thought, to see if I’ll yell.

Sheli Yara'tel—envoy, diplomat, and official representative of the United Terran Compact to the Esari Hegemony—muttered an undignified “ugh.”

She was supposed to be calm. Controlled. That was her job. She wore it like a uniform: posture tall, claws sheathed, tone soft but firm. But here, in their tiny orbital bunk, the façade could drop just a little.

Sheli sat up, fur bristling slightly from static.

The door hissed open just as she was mid-yawn, revealing Ed in his grease-streaked uniform, holding a tray with two coffee cups and something from the synth-kitchen that looked vaguely like toast.

“Oh,” he said, pausing in the doorway. “You’re up.”

She narrowed her eyes. “You turned the thermostat down again.”

“Did I?” He looked entirely too innocent. “Must’ve been the faulty panel again. I’ll take a look.”

“You’re the faulty panel,” she grumbled, tail lashing once for emphasis before she caught herself and folded it primly across her lap.

He chuckled, stepping inside. “Coffee?”

Sheli took the cup from him wordlessly, eyeing him over the rim as she sipped. Too hot, she thought, but didn’t complain. It gave her an excuse to hold it for warmth.

“Big day?” he asked, sitting cross-legged on his bunk. Their quarters weren’t designed for roommates. The ship wasn’t even designed for diplomats, not really, but space was tight and bureaucracy was inefficient, so here they were—two beings from opposite ends of Earth’s evolutionary tree sharing 6 square meters of personal space.

“Delegation from the Esari Council arrives today,” she said, curling her legs underneath her. “Which means smiling, bowing, and pretending I don’t want to strangle someone every ten minutes.”

“Sounds fun.”

“I live for it.” She deadpanned, then gave him a side-eye glance and added, “Unlike some people who get to hide in the engine room and flirt with diagnostics.”

“It’s not flirting if it’s one-sided,” Ed said, sipping his coffee. “The diagnostics don’t love me back.”

She snorted. “I relate.”

He raised an eyebrow. “To the diagnostics?”

“To the one-sided part.”

Too much, she thought immediately, eyes flicking to see if he noticed. Backpedal.

“Like when I offer you the last protein bar and you say no but take it anyway,” she added quickly, giving him a sharp-toothed grin.

He smirked. “I take it because I know you want me to take it.”

“Exactly. One-sided generosity.” She stuck her tongue out briefly. Very undiplomatic.

Ed laughed again. It always hit her in the stomach in an annoying, fizzy way.

Later that day. Corridor 7B, near the docking ring.

Sheli stood near the viewport, watching the Esari shuttle lock onto Zhree’s outer docking corridor. She kept her arms behind her back, her formal jacket straight, her posture perfect. Her tail, betraying her, flicked once behind her ankles.

She recited the first five diplomatic principles under her breath.

1: Speak only after you’ve listened.

2: Mirror only what is useful.

3: Let silence speak before you do.

4: Assume peace, but prepare for threat.

5: Never show your teeth first.

The last one always got her. Her species’ default expression was a mild snarl to some aliens. Ed had called it “your resting murder face.” She had smiled sweetly and stepped on his foot.

Now, her internal comm pinged.

ED: ""How’s the tail? Twitching like you’re gonna bolt or wag like you’re about to get a cookie?""

Sheli felt the corners of her mouth twitch upward.

She typed back:

SHELI: ""Professional. Reserved. Ready to bite someone if they say ‘exotic’ again.""

A moment later:

ED: ""Give ‘em hell, fluffbutt.""

She coughed to stifle the laugh. Absolutely not dignified, she thought, but couldn’t stop the smile.

That night. Back in their quarters.

Sheli stood by the sink, brushing out the tangles from her neck fur, still in her uniform pants and undershirt. Ed sat on his bunk, boots off, fixing a broken circuit board under a desk lamp.

“You didn’t bite anyone, I assume?” he asked.

“Not for lack of temptation.”

She leaned against the counter, arms crossed loosely, looking at him. He was focused, tongue poking out slightly from the corner of his mouth. It was annoying how cute she found that.

He caught her staring.

“What?”

“Nothing.” She turned away too fast. Tail flicking.

He watched her for a second, then went back to his board. “You do that a lot.”

“Do what?”

“Look like you’re about to say something, then don’t.”

“I’m a diplomat,” she said with a shrug. “It’s half the job.”

A beat passed.

“You ever worry we’re gonna get reassigned?” she asked, not looking at him.

“Why?”

“Because this…” she gestured vaguely between them, “is comfortable. That makes me suspicious.”

Ed smiled. “Comfort’s allowed, y’know. Even for diplomats.”

She didn’t reply. Just reached over, flicked the light on his desk off with one claw, and walked back to her bunk.

“Hey—”

“You’re up early tomorrow,” she said without turning around, tail deliberately brushing his arm as she passed.

He blinked.

Sheli smiled to herself in the dark.

I had a lumbar puncture on Wednesday and started my 3 day solumedrol steroid the same day. Today is now Saturday and I started my oral taper of prednisone. 

Ever since the LP and solumedrol … I will say my “MS symptoms” went away but now I have a pressure headache, anxious, slightly blurred vision, i had 2 cups of coffee today, and been laying down, I just feel overall uneasy. My BP and heart rate is normal. I called the on call neurologist and he said i’m fine and if it’s I can’t get up then I should go to the ER.. I just can’t seem to relax at all with all this going on. 

It seems like all the symptoms contradict each other they say that if it’s from the LP then go to the ER but if it’s from the Solumedrol then it’s normal.. like how am I supposed to know!!! 

Can anyone relate or give some advice? Anyone else gone through this?

After His Eyes Opened

Chapter 1
""If you choose her today,"" I swallowed a sob. ""I'll die, Atlas,""
My husband, Atlas Volkan, froze at the door. He unhooked his arm from my sister's and marched forward.
I forgot how to breathe as he approached me, the scent of his cologne invading my nose like an addiction.
How do you love someone to the point of loathing yourself?
""I have always chosen her."" His words stabbed me in the chest. Turning the dagger, he continued. ""Today is her big day and if you love me, don't ruin it.""
Atlas turned to leave and I blurted. ""You are my husband. We are married, Atlas!""
""Enough, Julia!"" Lovie snapped, glaring at me ""Your marriage is a sham. Atlas loves me and you know this,""
""I have a bad feeling, Atlas."" I begged, ""Let me come. I'm scared Atlas.""
Atlas' gaze rested on me, almost as if he was worried, but the flicker in his eyes vanished as Lovie spoke.
""Choose, Atlas. Her or me?"" She asked. Like that, the fog cleared and he grabbed her wrist, leaving the house.
The sound of the keys inside the lock rang through the room. They left and locked me inside.
I walked over to the closest window, watching as they drove out. My husband and my older sister — the perfect affair.
My heart ached, my body trembled with sobs. This was my life and I hated it.
I prepared coffee to clear my mind and I barely took a sip when the banging came minutes later. I stumbled, wide-eyed as the door handle shook.
Someone... someone was trying to break in!
I bolted in the opposite direction, tripping over my feet as the door fell off its hinges.
My stomach twisted into knots as we made eye contact. The man in front of me looked taller, stronger, and masked.
He reached for me but I scrambled to my feet.
I flailed my hands and kicked my feet, barely able to hear anything over the sound of heavy pants escaping my lips. I froze as something grazed my skin, pain shooting through my torso.
My hands dug into my jean pockets and I speed dialed Atlas. He was the only contact I had.
The only one I trusted.
He didn't pick up.
I kicked the man between his legs and raced up the stairs. I struggled to breathe as I continued calling Atlas.
Pick up. Pick up! Pick—
An inhuman screech escaped my lips as the man grabbed my hair, pulling me. My back collided with the wall and I was face to face with his masked face.
Before I could process anything, his hands found their way to my neck — squeezing life out of me.
My eyes threatened to pop from their sockets as a soft whimper escaped my lips. Why was he trying to kill me?
In my life, I sacrificed everything for everyone. I did everything to be loved — wanted, to be seen.
But nothing worked and now, I was dying.
I was about to be killed by a stranger in my home, while my husband of three years was at my fashion show, parading with his lover. I was going to die alone, bleeding and gasping for air.
Was this the reward for being a good person?
I spat in the masked man's face and he let out a disgusted grunt. I took the chance to enter my room and lock the door.
I dialed Atlas, again and again. My knees threatened to buckle as I registered the number of times I had called.
Fifty-seven.
My chest tightened as I glanced at the door, which threatened to pop off its hinges.
He was going to break that door soon, and Atlas hadn't answered.
I called one last time, a soft gasp escaped my lips as his voice broke through.
""Atlas!""
""What is wrong with you, Julia? Why are you determined to make your sister unhappy?""
""Someone is trying to kill me, Atlas!"" I cried, my grip on the phone tightening. ""They are about to break into the room, At—""
""You will do anything to get my attention, won't you?""
""Just shut up and listen for once, Atlas. A man wants to kill your wife! Is Lovie the only one you—""
The door broke down and a shiver ran down my spine as the man stepped forward, a sadistic grin on his face.
""Why are you running?"" he whispered, ""I am setting you free, Julia.""
I stumbled, my heart falling into my stomach as I applied pressure to my torso. ""Stay away! Don't come close!"" I threw all the objects in the room at him, begging for him to leave.
He didn't budge.
My back hit the wall and my knees buckled as I registered blood on my hands. The adrenaline washed off as Atlas' voice reached me again.
""Yes, Lovie. That dress looks amazing on you.""
""I called Sylvia and she assured me everything was fine. Was Julia lying again?"" Lovie's sickeningly sweet voice followed.
My grip on the phone finally loosened, my life slipping from my grasp. As my body slacked against the wall, the fight for my life, died.
As the man lunged at me, his hands tracing my neck and squeezing — I didn't call Atlas.
I couldn't.
All my life... I had to prove myself, to fight for my place...
Why did I think it would be different with Atlas Volkan? In the end, he only saw me as his brother's murderer.
His priorities and love lay with Lovie, the one he was supposed to marry. I was the mistake he could not avoid.
The night before their wedding, I was kidnapped but escaped into his mansion, hiding in the first room I saw, drugged and barely breathing.
Atlas was in that room.
So, when we woke up to cameras and whispers — Everything changed. Rumors spread and I was forced to marry Atlas Volkan to avoid a scandal. Despite the bitterness between us, I did nothing but love Atlas Volkan.
I was the perfect wife and he was the nonexistent husband, the one who followed my sister's skirt and never found his way back.
As the man's grip on my neck tightened, a tear rolled down my cheek and life left me, slowly.
I sacrificed everything to earn his love and the one time I needed him — Atlas Volkan was nowhere to be found.
A final gasp escaped my lips and my eyes widened, my body jerking as I died a slow, cruel death.
As my vision blurred, my chest tightened. I lived my life for everyone but myself. If I was given a second chance...
I would not be my mother's obedient daughter, my sister's slave, and most definitely not Atlas' Volkan's submissive wife.
I would live for myself and walk away from everyone who never let me truly live.
As if my pleas were answered — my eyes shot open.
Chapter 2
I jolted upright, scanning my surroundings. I was back in my room. The door... was intact. The floor wasn't littered. No vases, no objects thrown about — nothing.
Not even blood and no masked man strangling me.
I traced my neck and torso. There was no sign of a struggle or even a scratch.
Don't tell me... I’ve been reborn!
I scrambled to my feet, my hands tracing my body in the mirror. Fate heard my pleas, I get to live again.
“All you you humiliated me,” I whispered, “Now, it’s my turn.” My gaze shifted to the door as loud knocks filled the room.
Steeling my nerves, I walked over to the door and opened it, hiding behind it. As the person stepped in, I raised the lamp to hit them but froze.
""Sylvia?""
""Hey! Have you gone mad?!"" The maid screeched, stumbling with wide eyes. ""Are you trying to kill me?!""
I glanced at the clock. Oh, it was two hours before the man arrived. This meant Lovie and Atlas were still downstairs.
""Your tea is ready."" Sylvia spat, setting it on my brown bedside table. Despite being my maid for years, she only followed Atlas' orders.
In the past, I raced downstairs, begging him to stay. Not anymore. I wasn't going to ask for permission.
I wasn't going to wait till death arrived. I would attend that Runway and make it a memorable one.
""Didn't you hear me? Drink up!"" She demanded and we locked eyes.
When she didn't win the staring contest, her face paled and she stared at me, confused.
She had every right to be worried and confused. After all, in the past, she bossed me around and humiliated me in my home.
I tightened my fist and glanced at the tea, recalling the lightheaded feeling I got after drinking it.
I was so weak and that was how the masked man succeeded.
Our eyes locked again as realization hit — Sylvia drugged me.
""Mr. Volkan said you should drink this and sleep. You better follow his orders, or else, we will be forced to—""
""You are fired,"" I spoke calmly.
The brown-haired woman's eyes widened. ""W-what?"" She asked. ""How dare you? Who do think you are to fire me? Look, your tea is already cold, and if you don't take—""
I collected the tea and she grinned. ""That is more like — ah!"" She cried and I watched as her uniform turned a shade darker, soaked in hot tea.
I took a step forward and she stumbled until her back hit the wall. ""Atlas, Lovie, they are not the boss of me. Much less, you.""
""B-but, why are you acting this way?"" Her voice shook. ""I only asked you to drink tea —""
I ignored her blabbering and strolled to my walk-in closet. I had to stop the runway.
If the masked man arrived, he would kill me. No, this time I would not allow it.
I frowned as I registered the light-colored dresses in the closet.
In the past, I only wore these dresses to impress Atlas. I figured the more I looked like Lovie, the longer I could keep Atlas.
Not anymore.
I yanked the clothes from the hangers and tossed them to the ground. I raised an eyebrow when I caught sight of a bold black dress.
Perfect.
Lovie not only hated black dresses — The entire Volkan family loathed the color black.
I pulled it out and walked over to my mirror. I reached for my hair, shutting my eyes as memories of Atlas filtered through.
He told me the only good thing about me was my soft long hair.
I kept growing it to please him. So, when I grabbed the scissors and started chopping it — I felt free.
For three years, I tried to win Atlas' heart. I clung to him. However, Atlas only ever saw me as his brother's murderer.
When I was dying, he abandoned me.
Atlas Volkan took me for granted. He insulted my love and —
""I'll remind you that you are making a big mistake, you are insane!""
I turned to Sylvia. ""Dispose of the dresses. Wear them, throw them out, do whatever you wish."" I informed her, glancing at the clock. ""I have a show to attend.""
""No!"" She rebuked, grabbing my wrist. I glanced at the clock, only five minutes more. ""I won't let you ruin Lady Lovie's night!""
I tried to yank my arm, my eyes widening as I registered how much time had passed. I glanced out the window behind me, my heart racing as I saw the masked man entering the house.
No, no, no!
""You won't go anywhere till tomorrow, that is Mr. Volkan's order!"" She said, glaring at me.
My breath hitched as the sound of banging came. He was at the door. I pushed Sylvia and raced out of the room, I had to leave through the backdoor and now.
I ran down the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest as the walls of the mansion threatened to close in on me.
I was about to step out when someone grabbed my hair. They pulled me back and I hit the dining table, crumbling to the ground.
Goosebumps ran over my skin as we locked eyes. He pulled out a knife and I pushed a chair to him, standing.
The masked man moved and I started throwing dishes at him — forcing him to take cover behind the kitchen door.
I was trapped. I glanced around, searching for something — anything to help me survive.
As he stepped forward, I grabbed the closest jar and threw the contents at him. I heaved a sigh of realization as he grunted, rubbing his eyes.
It was powdered pepper.
I bolted, running out the door without looking back. I had to get out, now!
The taller man followed me. I could hear his steps as my heart raced — loud and malicious.
Who was this masked man? Why did he want me dead?
I slipped and rolled on the ground, my knees bruising.
He pounced on me and started strangling me. I struggled to breathe, gasping for air as his grip tightened.
No, things couldn't end like this.
I couldn't lose a second time. Fate couldn't be so cruel.
Glancing around, I saw the knife from before, it must have fallen from his hand.
As the last bit of air was squeezed from me, I took my chance. I grabbed the knife and stabbed him.
The man froze, falling off me. His phone slipped out, ringing.
The sound made me flinch but my eyes widened as I registered the caller's name.
""Lovie.""
My blood boiled as I picked it up.
I knew she was capable of everything — hurting, humiliating, manipulating me.
Killing me, however? That was too low, even for her.
Lovie didn't just want everything — Lovie wanted to kill me. My sister wanted to kill me?
My body slacked as the man bled, I was frozen, nursing the betrayal.
I sacrificed everything for her. I agreed to marry Ryle in the past so she could be with Atlas and this...
This was how she repaid me?
I got up, my knees wobbling. The scent of betrayal and anguish was in the air, but I dared not cry.
I had a runway to attend. I hailed a cab and got in, my fists tightening. When we saw each other, I would settle the score.
Chapter 3
""Stop here,"" I said to the cab driver.
The man nodded and I got out, staring at the grand building.
My fists tightened at my sides. It was time to crash their little celebration.
I walked toward the door but two guards stopped me.
""I'm sorry, you can't go in.""
""What do you mean? This is the Volkan's building, I have every right to enter.""
""Entry is by invitation and Mr. Volkan made it clear that you cannot enter—""
""Julia?""
I glanced in the direction of the voice and locked eyes with her.
Her face paled and I bit hard on my bottom lip.
Lovie Knight marched forward, grabbing my arm. ""What are you doing here? Atlas made it clear that you should stay at home. Why can't you follow simple orders?"" She spat, running her hands through her hair. ""What if someone sees you?""
""What?"" I matched her tone. ""Are you scared of your secret being exposed? That everyone will find out you're a fake and I am the real designer? That you're feeding on my hard work?""
Lovie raised an eyebrow, releasing me. ""Wow, you have... You have grown wings, haven't you? Now, you are talking back?""
""I won't just talk back, I will show everyone your true color, Lovie.""
I started walking but some security men surrounded me. I gasped when they grabbed me.
""I think you've got it all wrong, little sister. This is my runway. I am the face of Volkan Empire's latest collection."" she smirked as I fought against her. ""I took Atlas and I am taking this too. Nothing and no one can stop me from walking down that runway. Not even you, Julia.""
My eyes widened as she walked away.
""Lovie! You won't get away with this! I promise you! I will expose you, today itself!""
She simply turned and laughed before strolling off.
I fought against the men as they tied me up, throwing me into a small storeroom outside. I fell face first, my blood boiling.
I tried to remove the ropes, but no matter how hard I fought, it was futile. I frowned when the smell of gas reached my nostrils.
Glancing around, my eyes widened when I saw a gas cylinder. My chest tightened and I pushed myself up.
I froze for a moment. My sister had done this to me? First she tried to kill me and now? All my life, I tried to win her affection and approval but now reality was glaring at me.
Lovie Knight had never seen me as family. Neither had Mother. I was always a tool for them and no matter how many times I tried to downplay it, the truth was crushing.
I tightened my fists, pushing back a sob that threatened to escape my lips. I wasn't here to cry over spilled milk. I was here to take my revenge. I was no longer a little girl — vying for her attention.
I wanted my rights. Lovie had a habit of taking things that belonged to me and I was going to break it.
I had to get out and fast. I could barely cough or breathe through the gag. My eyes scanned the room and a sigh of relief escaped my lips when I saw a blade.
Lovie... she crossed all limits. All of them — everyone I cared about, they proved they were undeserving of my love.
Atlas... how would he react to knowing his innocent princess was a murderer?
Would he be glad I was the victim? The thought almost made me laugh.
I reached for the blade as the dusty room made my skin crawl. I could already hear the speakers announcing Lovie's arrival.
I had to stop the show and expose the truth — Lovie was a liar and Atlas was her accomplice.
Those were my designs and I was no longer willing to sacrifice anything. It wasn't my fault Ryle died. Someone else did it.
So, why was I paying for these crimes? It was Atlas who chose to marry me. Yet, I was humiliated for six years.
I was facing the consequences of their decisions. It was time they faced it too.
I winced as the blade cut my skin but I continued cutting the ropes, once my hands were free — I removed the gag and gasped for air.
I walked over to the door but froze when I remembered security was outside.
If I came out, they wouldn't let me on the runway.
They had strict instructions to keep me out. I started searching for a disguise in the boxes littering the room.
This was the storeroom where all the unwanted clothes and items were kept. The ones that of course, didn't match Lovie's taste.
Without a second thought, I pulled out another dress, a sparkling black one. I sighed in relief as I saw a mask.
I wore the dress and mask, adjusting it before I exited the room. Thankfully, the guards weren't even there.
I took the chance to slip inside, strolling toward the runway hall.
I could almost hear Lovie's laughter, basking in praise she did not earn. It was time to pull the rug underneath her feet and face Atlas.
Atlas. My heart broke at his name. The first man I loved and the first man who broke my heart.
I sucked in a sharp breath and strolled inside, watching as guests started whispering amongst themselves.
My eyes locked with Lovie's green orbs. She clenched her jaw, looking shocked and irritated.
I strolled down the runway but she caught my arm midway. ""Who are you and what are you doing here? You must be a measly worker, You are fired!""
""Lovie!"" I turned to see Mother. She approached us, her smile wearing off as more people focused on the scene.
A masked woman, walking down the runway and stealing Lovie's spotlight? It was a sight for sore eyes.
""Who could she be?""
""She doesn't seem fazed by Miss Knight!""
""Didn't you hear me? You are fired, Get out!"" Lovie spat, glaring daggers into my skin. I rolled my eyes.
""No,"" Mother protested and I raised an eyebrow. ""She created a scene, wearing black and walking down the runway. She must apologize!""
""Yes, apologize,"" Lovie said, smiling. ""Go on. Don't be scared. I may even forgive you.""
""Shouldn't you be asking for forgiveness? After all, you are in someone else's limelight. Or can you deny that these are your sister's designs?""
Gasps rang through the room, followed by multiple camera flashes. Lovie glanced around, looking flustered.
""Is what she is saying true?!"" One demanded
""Does VK designs not belong to Lovie? What a bomb!""
""Who are you and how dare you make such claims at me? I will ruin your life—""
""I am ruining yours at the moment, so, hold on."" I spat. ""This woman has been impersonating the real golden designer for years. She has taken credit for all the designs and the only thing she does is parade in front of cameras!""
The camera's flashed and Lovie stumbled, her eyes glazed with fury.
""How dare you make such accusations? I am the owner of these designs. I made them!""
""Did you?""
""I don't have to answer to you. I don't even know who you are.""
""Lovie? What's going on here? Who is this?""
""Atlas"" Lovie broke into tears. ""Atlas this woman, she's saying that everything belongs to Julia. Everyone knows I am the designer, right? They are questioning it because of her.""
Atlas' eyes narrowed at me, standing straight. The dark-haired man's black suit clung to him, his stance powerful and unyielding.
""What proof do you have?"" Atlas boomed, narrowing his eyes. He crouched down beside Lovie, comforting her.
My heart ached, he had never defended or shown me any affection. Yet, here he was, publicly comforting my sister. Was I too hard to love?
The sturdy man glared at me, looking every bit like a Ruthless CEO in his three-piece suit and solid strides.
""Atlas! I worked so hard. yet..."" Lovie cried, hiding her face in his shoulder.
""You haven't worked a day in your life, Lovie. So, how can this be true?""
""There must be something about this voice. The murderer at home speaks like this too. Security, throw her out!"" Atlas growled.
""I am not going anywhere until she confesses the truth. Say it. Say that you've been stealing your sister's designs for years!""
""Enough!"" Atlas boomed, his gaze icy cold. He grabbed my arm. ""Since you won't leave, I will throw you out myself.""
I yanked my arm from his and reached behind my mask, grinning as it fell off.
Something flickered in Atlas' eyes while Lovie's face paled.
The guests and reporters erupted into an uproar, and I grinned.
""Tell me, hubby. How can you throw me out of my runway?""
Chapter 4
""Julia!"" Mother fumed, her eyes pinning me with a glare. ""How dare you come here?""
Lovie broke into a sob. ""Mummy, why is she doing this? Why is Julia trying to ruin my life? She's always hurting me!""
""Stop pretending to be—""
""Enough, Julia!"" Mother spat. ""I thought you mended your ways. What did you say? You gave her rights to these designs. You said you were atoning for your mistake—""
""Why should I atone for something I did not do?""
Mother huffed. ""Did not do?"" she repeated, ""You slept with your sister's fiancé and married him. His brother was driven to commit suicide because of your shameless act!"" she grabbed my arm. ""For the past six years, they have suffered! How can you stand here and act like a victim?""
""Look Mother, I am not here to dig up the past. I am here to discuss the present reality."" I shifted my gaze to Lovie. ""I am the real designer of all VK designs and I want my rights and recognition""
""All of a sudden?"" Atlas growled.
I turned to see him raising an eyebrow. ""Just a few hours ago, you were begging to come here. You told me you would behave and not disrupt the ceremony. Yet... you arrived and you're saying this? Disgusting!""
""What exactly do you want Julia? You want to humiliate me in front of everybody?"" Lovie broke into a sob and hid in Atlas' arms.
""Can you see how much you are hurting her?"" Mother spat. ""Your sister is in pain!""
""What about me? What about all the pain and hard work I have put in? I shared my husband for six years. Now, she can have him, I want everything else.”
I marched over to the banners and decorations and tore them down.
""Oh no! Does this mean the rumor is true?""
""The true designer for VK designs is Julia Volkan and not Lovie Knight?""
""What did she mean by sharing her husband? What is going on?""
The reporters asked, their eyes wide and hungry for information.
""Yes, I designed everything myself, and if she insists that she did it, fine,"" I said and Lovie smiled, relaxing.
I reached for a sketchbook and pen, throwing it at Lovie. ""Prove it and I will do the same, sketch a design!""
The room fell silent as Lovie's eyes widened. ""W-what?!"" She blurted. ""Why should I do that? Everyone knows—""
""If she is the real designer, why would she have any problem sketching a design?
""Does this mean that she is a fake—""
""No, no. no! I am not a fake, I—"" she stumbled over her words, flustered. ""Why should I prove anything to her? This is my launch, why are you stealing it, Julia?""
""Sketch. If you don't draw today, everyone will know I am telling the truth. Draw!""
Lovie glanced around and picked up the paper and pencil, her hands shaking. She was about to start drawing when Atlas caught her wrist.
""Enough."" He growled, throwing it away. ""Lovie doesn't have to prove anything, especially not to you."" He informed me. ""You better watch your tone —""
""Or what?""
""Julia, you are crossing the line. You are damaging our reputation"" Atlas spat and grabbed my arm, he tried to pull me out but I didn't budge.
""Hubby,"" I closed the distance between us, ""You are sleeping with my sister, what bigger scandal can there be than that?""
""What! The CEO of Volkan Industries, Atlas Volkan is sleeping with his wife's sister?!""
I watched as Atlas' chest rose and fell with fury. He grabbed my wrist and forcefully dragged me away from the press, I fought against him till my back hit a wall.
Our eyes locked, breaths tingling. ""This is what you wanted, right? To look pitiful? To destroy my image? To hurt your sister?"" He snarled. ""She is the only reason you are not in prison for killing my brother and still —""
""Your brother committed suicide. I didn't kill him. Someone drugged me and —""
""Again with that sick story! No one drugged you! You slid into my bed and I had to marry you!"" Atlas' jaw tightened.
""I never forced you! However, I may have to force you for my rights."" My breath hitched as he grabbed my chin, forcing me to look at him.
""What rights?"" He snickered. ""You think you'll walk in here, create a scene and we will accept it? Who do you think you are, Julia? It is your word, against the three of us. You are outnumbered.”
""Really? Why can't you stand in front of the press and say this? Why are you whispering?""
""Let it be, Atlas. I forgive her, she's just stressed."" Lovie murmured and we turned to her.
""She—"" She took a step forward and collapsed to the ground.
""Lovie!"" Atlas crouched down beside her, glaring at me. ""Can you see what you have caused? Julia, you are —""
""No, please, no."" Lovie cried, hiding in his chest. ""There is no point, my life is a joke."" She sobbed and I rolled my eyes.
""Look at what you have done to your sister, shameless!"" Mother rebuked.
""Get out, Julia. Leave now!"" Atlas growled, his eyes darkening.
""I am not going anywhere till we return to the stage and you announce the truth.""
Atlas stood, daring me to continue as he stepped forward. ""And what is the truth?""
""The truth is that I am the owner of those designs. I designed those dresses and Lovie has taken the credit for years, why?"" I tightened my fists at my sides, my stomach churning.
""You are the one who allowed this in the past. You said you wanted to make amends, and now..."" He scoffed. ""You are showing your true colors!""
""Back then, I had the wrong impression."" I thought if I gave everything I had, he would love me and they would accept me.
However, despite taking everything — Lovie plotted to kill me.
""Now, my eyes have opened.""
Atlas rolled his eyes and I frowned. ""I think you are too late. No matter what you say or do, no one will believe you.""
""Are you challenging me?"" I retorted.
""No, I am stating facts. No one can ever believe you. Legally, those are Lovie's designs."" I frowned and it deepened as Atlas pulled out his phone and showed me an e-document.
My face paled and my chest tightened. It felt like a rug had been pulled underneath me
""Your designs, your life. Everything belongs to me, Julia. Do you understand?""
""This… this is fake!"" My knees threatened to buckle as I stared at the document.
The camera flashes tore through the moment, grounding me. I could barely hear their murmurs over the sound of my heartbeat.
The document in front of me stated that Lovie had copyright over my designs. My signature was boldly drawn there.
How?
""What did you say?"" Atlas taunted. ""These were your designs? You created them... Lies!"" He boomed and turned to the reporters.
My heart raced. They followed us here. Mother helped Lovie stand, while she clung to her.
""This is the real proof,"" Atlas showed them his phone and I shook my head.
""No, I don't remember signing anything.""
""Of course, you don't."" He informed me, ""You remember everything except the truth — how convenient.""
""He's lying. These are my designs, why would I sell them off?"" I almost sobbed as my heart twisted in my chest.
A tear dared to roll down my cheek and Atlas tightened his fist, looking away.
""What are those tears for? Another attempt at forced sympathy?""
Three years.
I stayed with this man for three years and he didn't bat an eye before betraying me.
He left me to die and now, this.
My stomach churned as the reporters glared at me.
""This is disgusting! She crashed her sister's runway to humiliate her!""
""I can't believe I was siding with her! Horrible!""
""Atlas? I am feeling dizzy."" Lovie whispered and Atlas lifted her but he kept his gaze on me.
""Mrs. Volkan, why did you do this?""
""Yes! Why did you stoop so low?""
""Maybe this is why he is cheating! She is not a good woman!""
“Enough!” I snapped, my heart breaking as I glared at Atlas. “I am sick of this drama. Let us settle this once and for all. I insist that those documents are fake and I am ready to repeat that in any court, and add that I was either forced to sign it under duress or it is forged.”
Atlas frowned, narrowing his eyes at me. “You would dare go against me?”
“Hubby, look around. I was never with you, to begin with. I have never been a part of your life. So, from what bond do you demand loyalty?”
Our eyes locked and his lips twitched, almost as if he wanted to say something but no sound came.
“In addition, I am launching a new collection in three days and Lovie should launch another collection, it is one thing to be the designer in name and another thing to be the CEO of VK Industries. If I can prove that I am a better designer, I want that seat and not just that, I want my twenty percent back.” I declared to the press and Atlas.
“Yes, yes. Mrs. Volkan has a point. It has to be a fair fight.”
“She can’t be this bold while lying.”
“Yes, Mr. Volkan cannot reject a fair compromise, right?”
I turned to Atlas, “Deal?”
Our eyes locked. “And if you fail?”
I stepped forward. “I will publicly apologize to Lovie and —”
“You will sign a Non disclosure contract and completely license all future works to Lovie. Deal?”
My heart dropped. He… he wanted me to give her everything? All my rights and designs?
“What, Julia? Are you having cold feet?”
Chapter 5
""You are lying,"" My knees threatened to buckle as I stared at the document.
The camera flashes tore through the moment, grounding me. I could barely hear their murmurs over the sound of my heartbeat.

My heart dropped. He... he wanted me to give her everything? All my rights and designs?
""What, Julia? Are you having cold feet?""
I swallowed the lump in my throat. I could not afford to be weak now. I trusted in my skills and this was my only chance to expose them. ""Deal.""
Atlas nodded, shoving me aside as he carried Lovie out, leaving me with the press.
Once again, he chose her. Despite the reality, my knees threatened to buckle at their proximity.
I brushed past the reporters and took a taxi home. I ran my hands through my hair, irritated as rain fell.
This was a horrible time to be dealing with the weather. Stepping out of the cab, I walked toward the door and frowned when it was locked.
I glanced around for any sign of my belongings but there was none.
The rain slapped me on the cheek but I continued knocking, ""Sylvia!"" I called. ""Anyone? I am out—""
The door opened to reveal Atlas.
I tried to enter but he stopped me. ""You are not coming inside.""
I frowned and crossed my arms, ""Why? This is also my house.""
""Yes,"" He admitted, ""You can come in after your punishment.""
My forehead creased. ""Punishment? And what am I being punished for?""
""Are you going to pretend you don't know what you did?"" He spat, glaring at me. ""You destroyed Lovie's happiness! You snatched her father, husband, and now, her credit. Do you have no limits? Or a shred of empathy?""
""I am your wife, Atlas. But your priority lies with her?"" I narrowed my eyes at him ""I would rather die than empathize with her.""
""Fine, stay in the rain then! Over there,"" He gestured at a shade but didn't meet my eyes. ""Because you won't enter unless you apologize to her!""
The door shut in my face and I sighed as the rain continued.
I wrapped my arms around myself and sat in front of the door. Shed? Since when did he care about me?
My stomach twisted into knots as the rain continued assaulting the ground.
The sound of the door opening caught my attention and I frowned as Lovie stepped out.
""I must admit, you grew a backbone out here,"" Lovie said before she chuckled. ""But you failed. No one believed you.""
""For now. I will prove to everyone that you are a fake, Lovie.""
""You couldn't prove that you didn't kill our father. Or that you didn't drug Atlas, or that you didn't try to hurt me."" She closed the distance between us and whispered. ""So how will you prove your rights?""
""Lovie—""
""I am just saying, Julia. You have a track record of being a failure and I am here to end it.""
I frowned at her words and watched wide-eyed as something cold touched my hands.
I flinched when I realized it was a gun. ""I have snatched everything, just like I promised. Remember? After Father died saving you, I promise I would take everything you loved. Look, I win.""
""Feel free to end it. No one will miss you.""
My body slacked as she walked into the house, shutting the door. My blood boiled.
I was about to tug on my hair when my phone pinged, I opened it to see a text, and as I read it, my stomach twisted even more.
I hid my phone and curled into myself, the content in that text would be a last resort.
The sound of laughter reached me and I stood, walking over to the window.
My heart ached as Atlas and Lovie played with flour. It looked warm inside, and soon, he was dancing with her.
He was neither soft nor kind to me but to her?
Atlas was Prince Charming.
Even now, I was outside being drenched in rain while they were celebrating.
I glanced at the text again — why should I hold back? I had the chance to ruin the Volkan family and Lovie, there was nothing to look back at.
I didn't want this life anymore.
Wiping my tears, I sent a response to the person and allowed the rain to drown me.
My eyes opened as the sound of footsteps rang through. I sat up, seeing Atlas and Lovie.
The dark-haired man wrapped his arms around her. ""So, are you ready to apologize?""
""I'd. rather. die.""
His eyes darkened at my words and he grabbed my arm. ""If you don't apologize—""
""What more can you take from me, Mr, Volkan?""
There was a flicker in his eyes and his grip loosened a bit. However, it was gone as soon as it came.
""I will throw you out of the house.""
My heart ached and my insides churned as he held her close. He had never been so blatant and open with their affair.
But, they had spent the night together in our home while I was outside, drenched in the rain.
There was no sympathy or space left in his life for me and there was no space in my heart either.
For her, he was snatching my life's work...
He would be elated at my decision. I was going to set him free so he could be with Lovie. His first love.
I swallowed the lump in my throat. I was done. ""There is no point dragging this out,""
I brushed past them into the house, rushing to his study. I pulled out the document he had threatened me with for years.
I turned to see them behind me. They followed me, even better.
I locked eyes with Atlas and a tear rolled down my cheek as I spoke, handing him the papers.

1mlxp2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1mlxp2e/_/,--,"I'm trying to stay in the right track, but so many echoes of negative thoughts worry me, so I etch them into a journal so I can see my pitiful woes. I'm trying to increase my awareness of so much, I have to push through all the old wounds that keep me stuck, and I am so sad and full of regret. For as much as I miss you and our connection, I know you need peace, I value how you feel so much after I've decimated it. It's my fault. I'm just so sorry. 

It's like an elephant on my chest every single day. The pain of losing you all, losing what I wanted to build with you, to give to you and them, to have a fun and happy future and I selfishly threw gasoline on a spark to watch everything burn up in pure shame. I know I deserve it. I hope you can have some peaceful days; I don't want to bother you, I promise I won't, because it's hard to find a balance between wanting to show you I care enough of your feelings, but also I want to care for your feelings and not bring you negative clouds with my presence when I used to bring you joy. I want you to feel happy and I hope you don't think I can't do this one thing for you all, to be healed and help heal. To not be so mean just to be mean, those words are from pain that have no meaning or belief, I will never allow myself to be so poorly out of control again. I already can't bring myself to even be angry at work anymore, there is no value in such a bad grip of negativity. How awful to have such a drain.  

I'm sure you will be happier without me being so selfish when I say, 'woe is me and my feelings', wondering if you'll still love me at all, still want to be with me, still want to laugh and talk with me, have a future. I always hate so much when I hurt you and the kids, to be someone you cannot trust and not live up to expectations of how I want to uphold on myself, for everyone, to serve everyone as a real man should. To provide, to love, to provide that love, to be standing steady through the winds of emotions and tell you, 'We'll get through this just fine'. I'm sure this all sounds so easy to dismiss as just emotion-based words. But I mean it. And I know I have it in me, I just slip and fall when it matters the most. I am stuck in a weak man's path that I can no longer tolerate when it turns me into a selfish and emotional fool. I know you don't need me; I am so sorry to fail you. I am so sorry to make you feel like it's safer to burden yourself with all of the loads. And I really feel disappointed in myself that you have to. I always want to help, to feel relied on, to feel trusted. The life it brings me that you have any faith in me at all makes me want to strive for more. I'm deeply regretting it so much in so many ways. Sometimes I have to push out the fear that you might try to distance from me because it's easier to fully let me go without seeing me around. I don't want to sound selfish. It's just a natural fear, I guess. A fear that I hurt you to the point of disgust. I'd never forgive myself for as long as I loved if I pushed you away. You, the very one and only I never expected to ever meet in this world who lived just so close by, for so many years, and had no idea I'd feel such a pull without even knowing your name at first glance.

I hope to whatever powers that be that I can have another chance, of course I do, I owe it to you all to do things right and get un-stuck from my own selfish drain-circling. You deserve to heal and not feel like you're walking on the very edge of the glass from how I've been for so long. I admit, I was irresponsible for getting the right help I needed. It's been hard to differentiate what's a real issue and what's just emotions being out of hand. I'm so sorry for all the shaken promises, the dread of not being reliable, the pain of feeling like 'this again'. You must be so tired of me. But I want you to know, I cherish and always think of every single time you've given me help, given me support, to better my emotional state, the techniques, the methods, use my 5 senses, use positivity posters and calendars, and I still have a 2 page list you made for me, on my wall, of all the good things to be grateful for in my life, and you're on it twice. Always so sweet. I feel so guilty. I guess this is why hearts have so many chambers, because I feel the deepest love and the deepest sorrow all at once.

Until I can give you the unshaken proof that I can be who I want to be for us, to be the best version of who I want to be, and to earn whatever grace you have left for my years failures and misjudging, I send all of my love and hope that when you look for the rainbows, after the dark of the rain, you get to see two. Or to find a beautiful moth, its furry form with dusty wings after it tries to hide in a shady spot to rest. I hope for you to get endlessly lost in a book with a savory story, words lifting you from the plane of earthly existence and dropped into worlds you never knew of, or return to old worlds your familiar with, like seeing an old friend after so long. I hope the warmth of your coffee fills your amazingly intricate heart from every cockle and nook where your imagination goes, where song lyrics send you to a yesteryear, a fond memory, a fun moment, a joke you so stupid and silly that it makes you laugh, I love your laugh. It means you're free and happy. Find a blended sunset that stops you in your tracks, and try to remember your most favorite part of each day. ",2,1754766966.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False

music really does impact me in significant ways

  it changes my vibe
 my energy

music/sound is involved in light travel
   somehow

still working that out too


basically what i keep coming back to
  is that the human body needs to hit a specific energy level
 in order to achieve light travel

internal fusion
  electricity 
    -> say for example, static electricity 
 somehow i keep getting this impression


i've ""known"" for months now

  i have a self-experiment i need to run
but i don't have enough/all the components yet

i need to get really
 really
     really
               really
        really
  high

every form of cannabis i can imbibe at once
  highest potency possible 
    i need shrooms too
  also as potent as possible
           then i need a bunch of stones
             -> opals in particular
 and i need to sing

to a lot of people
  cuz i need to energize ya'll too


it's reciprocal 


because ya'll will feed off my energy
  and energize me further


my body is unique
  it's in my dna
 something truly funky is going on in here


i wish someone would take me seriously 
   and help me get these damn diagnostics 

not just for myself and my answers
  for ya'll too
 i want ya'll to heal like i have been

i hate seeing so many people
  in so much pain
    day after day
 without true relief
           -> it's bullshit


pi represents a portion of a circle
  aka
      the circle of life
   or cycle, if you prefer

pi and 42 are one in the same
  -> discreet mathematics 

pi is natural and nature
  42 too
     -> "" 420""
          -> the value within the null and the void

marijuana 
  ya'll really need to imbibe in this more
 -> don't like it/care for it?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Tennis Showdown: Sorana Cirstea vs. Magdalena Frech – A Matchup of Grit and Gluttony for Punishment**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn, because we’re diving into a WTA Cincinnati Open clash that’s as statistically dense as a tennis ball is hollow. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this match feels like a bet on whether your morning coffee will be hot or just “emotionally hot.”

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math of Heartbreak and Hope

The odds here are as clear as a first-serve ace from a player who’s never missed a shot in their life. Let’s crunch the numbers:

* **Magdalena Frech** is the consensus favorite, with **decimal odds as low as 1.65** (BetMGM), translating to an implied **60.6% chance to win**.
* **Sorana Cirstea** is the underdog, priced at **2.15** (BetMGM), implying a **46.5% chance**.

The spread markets are all over the place, with Frech favored by **3.5–4.5 games**, and totals set at **30.5 games** (even though no one plays 30 games in a single match—bookmakers, we know you’re just trying to confuse us). The key takeaway? Frech is the safer bet, but Cirstea’s underdog status makes her an alluring gamble for those who thrive on heart-stopping, third-set tiebreakers.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Art of Tripping Over Nothing

Let’s check in on our players:

* **Magdalena Frech** enters this match as the human embodiment of “grind until the opponent quits.” She’s coming off a **five-set thriller** where she saved **four match points** to advance, proving she’s the tennis equivalent of a Netflix series you can’t stop watching—even if the plot holes are the size of the Grand Slam trophies she’s chasing. No injuries reported, which is surprising given her habit of sliding into positions most humans would require a forklift for.
* **Sorana Cirstea**, meanwhile, is the story of **resilience and questionable serve placement**. Recent matches show her struggling with **double faults**

1mlxkb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1mlxkb4/as_requested_the_protocol_i_took_to_improve_my/,"As requested, the protocol I took to improve my health","OK a bit of background: white, female, 30s, BMI around the 19 mark, slim athletic build.

Issue: I went through a period of extreme exhaustion, I would struggle to get out of bed, no energy at work, heavy menstruation starting to get irregular, feeling dry, hair loss, no appetite and just general depression.

Now: my hairloss has slightly abated but I still lose too much (I have very long thick hair even now though thankfully just it used to be insanely thick), regular menstruation that is not as heavy (but still too heavy), ok energy levels, better appetite, better mood but still not 100% and I have not ovulated in a while.

As you can see I have improved A LOT but there are still some improvements to be made. 

What works: I tried so many things, Chinese herbs, b vitamins, red light saunas to no avail

What actually worked was quite simple coffee with aspirin in the morning with thiamine in the evening.

In terms of diet I try to avoid PUFAs but I will not obsess over it. I follow Chinese medicine principles so I do not eat oysters or venison in summer for example. Instead, right now I focus on eggs, chicken and white fish. As autumn approaches I will try to eat moistening foods such as pear, duck and milk. In Winter is when I eat the heavy duty Ray peat stuff like grass fed calf liver, oysters, venison. 

I must confess I do not really eat as much as ray peat says we should, I snack on strumpwaffel till about lunch, at least that is what I have been doing recently. I am trying to order some raw buffalo milk as I am convinced buffalo milk is manna from heaven. 

I get Rolfing 3-4 times a year and I think it is essential for metabolism and energy flow to release stuck fascia 

One magic tip for inflammation that I have never heard anyone discuss before is to fast that day,  cover your body with castor oil and then sit in the sauna for 20 mins so it penetrates deep into the tissues, after your shower rub yourself down with magnesium spray then spend the day drinking orange juice with some bicarbonate of soda and salt. I know Ray Peat does not advice fasts but a 24hour fast really does kickstart your body and give you a rest (only in summer, I would NEVER fast in cooler weather).

Not because I hate dating—okay maybe *a little*—but because swiping, ghosting, and bios written like job interviews are not exactly my idea of romance. Still, here I am, cautiously optimistic and mildly caffeinated.

I’m in my mid-30s, freshly committed to taking better care of myself. That means hitting the gym more days than not, discovering the magic of skincare beyond just washing my face, and generally trying to level up in life (and not just in video games).

Speaking of which—yes, I’m a gamer. Not the “yells at 12-year-olds online” kind, more like “let’s play co-op and talk about life while we explore an open world” kind. I’m also the person who will rewatch an entire movie franchise just to prep for the new one (yes, even if the sequels weren’t great—loyalty is important!).

I’m a homebody at heart who’s learning to balance comfort with growth. I like people who are kind, curious, and emotionally intelligent—or at least trying to be. Bonus points if you know how to cook, laugh at your own jokes, or secretly cry at Pixar movies.

Not looking to rush, but I’m not here to endlessly chat either. If you’re also in that weird-but-exciting space between healing and hoping, let’s talk. Or play a game. Or just awkwardly laugh through an overpriced coffee date.

1mlxib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1mlxib5/i_dont_feel_i_like_my_doctor/,I don't feel I like my doctor,"Normally, I am very satisfied with my doctor, normally I feel like I have good care. I do feel like I am a very relaxed patient and trusting, I don't feel that I say I know it all, but I am not completely dumb when it comes to the medical field. I have worked at nursing homes for ages, not that that makes me brilliant, but I am not as naive as I could be. Almost all of my female relatives are nurses. I chose not to be a nurse because I don't care for the paperwork and drama and I do not like messing with dosages. 

I (30f) was diagnosed with allergies 2 years ago. Which has very much infuriated me as I have struggled with allergies since I was 12 years old. I was being called out from school all of the time, had several ear infections during the year, looked terrible, had wheezing episodes. 

It shouldn't take 16 years to finally get diagnosed with a few allergies. 

I told the allergist I felt I had a dog allergy at the least and she said well it doesn't seem to be..... then I tested 4/5 on the skin rash test for dogs and the other I received a mold spore allergy. 

This was only the generic 20 skin test, they did do a blood test that showed nothing which was no surprise it never showed anything before either.

Years before this I had been struggling with my digestion, I finally had met with a doctor over this, he said he thinks I have more food allergies and that I need to document my reactions. 

My dad has had allergies his whole life, several of them, usually tests positive for about 16 different things. He takes the immunotherapy shots. 

I am on daily xyzol, an otc daily nasal spray, a daily prescription nasal spray, daily montelukast, a daily inhaler, a prn inhaler, prn eye drops that I use daily, and I don't feel like it helps all that much, granted I don't take them as I am supposed to either....

Which I have reached out to the doctors about as well and they don't care. 

I take the xyzol, I usually take the otc nasal, but the daily prescription bottle leaked all over and so I ran out and I am scared to carry it in my purse, I take the montelukast, I usually forget my daily inhaler though as I have busted my prn inhaler and I am scared to bust that inhaler as well by carrying it around. The prescription nasal spray also messes with my sense of smell and taste and it's not like I taste it and I use it appropriately but I always get drainage that I can taste and it's terrible. Keeping up with this many meds on the daily level is a lot and my doctors don't seem to be understanding of that, but taking these daily, paying for these medications, refilling them when the pharmacy doesn't usually have them and I am still suffering anyways, is overwhelming.

When I run out of the meds is also when I get my period, because I am sometimes on bc and because of that I try and refill meds when they are all out. But this really difficult then because my face is blown up, I swear my allergies are worse, I am in pain, and I don't have it in me to do much.

I honestly question if I am allergic to some hormones, because as mentioned I feel worse with allergies during my period, I get hot flashes, my nails and hands get brittle, so does my face, I get bumps that don't seem pimplish they are just really rashy itchy bumps on my face, my asthma is worse and my lungs feel on fire, everything I eat just runs right through me. 
I struggle heavily with being sick during pregnancies, I have had two, both required medications the whole pregnancy and hospitalizations. 

I just am so tired of living this way, I can't get the allergy shots they prefer I use the medications, said that the meds are easier than going in for a shot and it's not! I can get the shot locally and I would need it twice a week, this is different than every day keeping up with several medications. 
It does however mean more work for the hospital. I can't get seen by the allergist that would give me shots with out a referral per my insurance and my doctor referred me to the same company allergist, the one who didn't really think I had allergies in the first place!

I feel like I should have more of a choice in this to receive the shots and or informed more of the negatives of the shots then if they are so not interested. I know the shots are medications but I am pumping several medications already into my system anyways. I'd rather have the specific one and see if it helps vs the several that I can't manage to make things better. I have time in my afternoons to go get a shot, i do not have time in my mornings or nights to manage all of this stuff with my toddler running around and trying to bandaid the symptoms the second I start my day. 

I vacuum constantly I change the air filter I have to be careful of which soap I use for my hands, I have to be careful about my detergent, my food, I clean out my air purifiers, I make sure the humidity is right,
Every morning I wake up and have a cup of coffee to warm and soothe my throat wash my eye boogers away, try and calm down my face, and from 7-11:30 I use the bathroom about 5 times. This happens with or without the coffee. If I am on my period I am using the bathroom about every 45 minutes. It doesn't matter what food I eat or doesn't seem to. I'm better off being more tested so I just know what to avoid but can't get that. You'd think if that is what the gi doctor said he could right a referral but he refused to.

Bad breakup with his roommate, couldn't find anything affordable right away. I felt bad for him because we ended things on decent terms two years ago. When he asked if he could crash in our guest room for a few weeks, I said yes. My husband wasn't thrilled but he's not heartless.

The first week was fine. My ex helped with dishes, kept to himself mostly. But then my husband started working earlier shifts. He'd leave at 6 AM and wouldn't get back until 6 PM. My ex and I would have coffee together in the mornings. We'd talk about old times, laugh about stupid stuff from when we dated.

One morning I was in my robe making breakfast. My ex came up behind me and hugged me. I should have stopped it but it felt nice. We kissed. Then we went upstairs.

This became our routine. My husband would leave, my ex and I would have sex, then I'd shower and go to my own job. It went on for six weeks. i kept telling myself it wasn't that bad because my husband and I barely had sex anymore anyway.

Last Tuesday my husband came home sick around noon. He found us in our bedroom. My ex was getting dressed, I was still under the covers. My husband just stood there for maybe ten seconds. Then he said ""Both of you need to be gone by Friday.""

My ex packed up that afternoon and left. But I tried to explain to my husband that this wasn't just about sex. My ex and I have history. My husband has been distant lately, always working or watching TV. I felt lonely. I told him if he paid more attention to our marriage this wouldn't have happened.

He said I was making excuses. I said he was being controlling by giving me an ultimatum. He makes good money and I only work part time, so if I leave I'll have nowhere to go. That's financial abuse. He's using money to control me instead of working on our problems.

He said I could work full time like everyone else. I said that was beside the point. He's my husband and he should want to fix this, not just kick me out like I'm some stranger.

Friday came and he started putting my stuff in boxes. I called his mom crying and she hung up on me. His sister blocked me on social media. My own family thinks I'm wrong but they don't understand how unhappy I've been.

I'm staying with a friend now but her couch isn't comfortable and I miss my house. My husband won't answer my calls. I think if we could just talk without him being so stubborn we could work this out.

Everyone keeps saying I cheated but it's more complicated than that. I was neglected and lonely. My ex was there for me when my husband wasn't. Yeah I made mistakes but my husband isn't innocent either.

So AITA for calling him controlling? Or should I have just accepted his ultimatum and left quietly?

## Key Features Analysis

The 2025 models of tables with ice boast a variety of advanced features focused on improving convenience, insulation, and style.

**Insulated Ice Compartment:**

A critical feature is the quality of the insulation in the ice compartment. Advanced models utilize double-walled construction with high-density foam insulation, resulting in significantly longer ice retention times. This ensures that drinks and snacks stay cold for extended periods,even in hot weather conditions. The best performers can maintain ice for up to 12-24 hours, depending on ambient temperature.

**Durable Construction Materials:**

The longevity of a table with ice depends heavily on the materials used.Premium models often use UV-resistant polyethylene or powder-coated aluminum for the frame and body,preventing fading,cracking,and rusting. The ice compartment itself may feature a seamless, food-grade plastic liner for easy cleaning and sanitation. Investing in a table with robust materials will ensure years of reliable use.

**Integrated Drainage System:**

Melting ice is inevitable, so an efficient drainage system is essential.Top-tier tables incorporate a built-in drain with a plug or spigot, allowing for easy removal of excess water. This prevents the ice compartment from becoming waterlogged and keeps beverages from floating aimlessly. Some models even include a drainage hose for directing water away from the table area.

**adjustable Height and Configuration:**

Versatility is key for a table that can adapt to different settings. Models with adjustable height settings are ideal for accommodating various seating arrangements, from low-slung lounge chairs to standard patio furniture. Some tables also offer modular configurations, allowing you to customize the size and shape of the ice compartment to suit your specific needs.

**Aesthetically Pleasing Design:**

Beyond functionality,design plays a crucial role. The best tables with ice seamlessly blend into outdoor settings, complementing existing furniture and décor.options range from sleek,modern designs with clean lines to more rustic styles with natural wood finishes. Features like integrated LED lighting can also enhance the ambiance,creating a visually appealing centerpiece for any gathering. Some models even include customizable panels to match the table to its surroundings.

## Core Benefits

Tables with ice provide several key benefits that enhance outdoor entertaining and overall convenience.

**Extended Cooling Times:** These tables keep beverages refreshingly cold for prolonged periods, eliminating the need for constant cooler refills. Imagine hosting a barbecue where guests can conveniently grab chilled drinks directly from the table, rather than rummaging through a melting mess in a traditional cooler.This ensures continuous enjoyment without interruptions.

**Enhanced Convenience:** A table with ice centralizes chilling and serving, creating a hassle-free experience. no more trips to the refrigerator or ice machine – everything you need is right at your fingertips. This is especially beneficial for large parties or events where minimizing movement and maximizing interaction is paramount. Guests can easily access drinks and snacks without disrupting the flow of the gathering.

**Improved Aesthetics:** Integrated ice tables enhance the look and feel of your entertaining area.Ditch bulky and unsightly coolers for modern and stylish tables that become a conversation starter and focal point. They elevate the atmosphere of any event by combining function with decorative appeal.

**Versatile Usage:** Tables with ice are not just for drinks. They can also keep appetizers, salads, and desserts chilled, extending food safety during warm weather events. This feature is especially useful for outdoor buffets and picnics. It ensures that perishable items stay fresh and appetizing for longer, reducing the risk of spoilage and ensuring guest enjoyment.

## FAQs Section

**Are these tables weatherproof and suitable for outdoor use?**

Yes, most tables with ice are designed for outdoor use and constructed with weather-resistant materials like UV-protected polyethylene or powder-coated aluminum. These materials resist fading, cracking, rusting, and other forms of damage caused by exposure to the elements. Though, it is indeed always recommended to cover the table during prolonged periods of inclement weather to maximize its lifespan.

**How easy is it to clean and maintain a table with ice?**

Cleaning and maintenance are generally straightforward. Most models feature a smooth, seamless interior liner that can be easily wiped down with soap and water. The integrated drainage system allows for fast and convenient removal of melted ice. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface. Regular cleaning after each use will help prevent the build-up of mold or mildew.

**What is the typical ice capacity of these tables?**

The ice capacity varies depending on the size and design of the table with ice. Smaller models may hold around 50-75 pounds of ice, while larger models can accommodate 100 pounds or more. The more ice the larger models can hold, the longer items will stay cold. Carefully check the product description for the exact ice capacity. Consider the scale of events you plan to host to determine an appropriate ice capacity.

**Can these tables be used without ice?**

Yes, most tables with ice can be used as regular tables even without ice. The ice compartment typically has a solid base, effectively converting it into a storage area or simply a flat surface. This versatility makes them useful all year-round,regardless of the weather. The table can still be set for regular use for meals, drinks, and décor.

>*""You see, back in the day in 1944, right after the war ended, there was a secret meeting in New Hampshire called the* Breton Woods Conference*, where delegates from 44 different allied nations all met up to create something called the IMF: the International Monetary Fund, aka the World Bank, which set the US dollar as the official global currency - number one, baby - printed right there in Philadelphia. This in turn gave us the magical ability to, at will, decide how much other countries' money was worth. And if you've ever been to a foreign country and asked yourself how the heck it cost you 100,000 of their dollars to get a cup of coffee in the morning, here's why. The US artificially devalued the currencies of dozens of countries through modified exchange rates after becoming the world standard in 1944, where American business titans frantically built factories in the countries with the lowest dollar in order to pay people in these countries as little as possible for labor and raw materials. This process is called* economic globalization *and is the reason for much of the world's poverty, as it forces formerly self-sufficient and non-capital-obsessed countries to industrialize, yet never have the opportunity to evolve into anything more than glorified factory states, or amusement park countries for more powerful nations like us...""*

I only realized halfway through that “the man” was actually a wooden chair with a flannel jacket draped over it. The pattern lined up just enough with the window glare to create the illusion of a head and shoulders.

1mlxag2,https://v.redd.it/e0sbocf7k1if1,Why is shot running so fast? [Stilosa and Timemore C2],"Hey there! I started my espresso journey a couple of weeks ago and this is my current setup: delonghi stilosa, 51 mm IMS precision basket, WDT tool, tamper and dosing funnel, and scale.

Most grocery stores near me don't carry fresh coffee; bagged options are either pre-ground or lack any roast date, showing only a best by date, which isn't very helpful. I'm thinking of ordering freshly roasted beans online to try.

As you can see in the video, my shots are running very fast, about 12 seconds for 32 grams of espresso using 16 grams of coffee. Also note how the stream is all over the place.

My grinder is the Timemore C2. While it works well for other brewing methods, dialing it in for espresso has been a challenge. Grinding finer takes a LOOOOONG time (nearly 20min) and tends to scatter coffee grounds everywhere. Owner of this grinder claim to get decent espresso results around 10 to 12 clicks on the adjustment dial, but I've gone down to 8 clicks from zero (tightest setting), and the shots are still running too fast.

I don't think the machine is choking due to exceedingly fine coffee, at least there is no visible leaks on top.

The puck looks somewhat muddy on top and quite wet throughout, which makes me think the puck is not firm enough.

I'm wondering if this is due to the grind not being fine and uniform enough, or if something else is going on. For reference:

• I use filtered water and purge hot water before brewing a shot.The grinder has about 50 adjustment steps/clicks, with 0 being the finest and 50 the coarsest.

Any insight would be appreciated thank you ",1,1754765988.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

\---Princess---

  

\---Walath’s perspective---

I enter the Terrans’ home, my heart beating so fast I feel it’s in danger of cracking my ribplate!

My whiskers swish through the air from anxiety.

I walk down the short entryhall, the scent of Human habitation (which is *not* something I feel full dive VR did proper **justice** to!) *filling* my nostrils.

Though not *unpleasant*, the smell is certainly powerful!

As I reach the end of the wall on my right, I start in surprise at the man I suddenly see sitting there.

He places a metal implement into his mouth and pulls it back out before laying it beside another on a round tray.

He stands up, revealing himself to be the better part of *twice* my **height**!

He turns to face me, revealing the claw scars left on his right cheek by my aunt.

He dips his flat face to fix me with his piercing, forward facing purple eyes.

I’m suddenly a *lot* less confident that I’m not going to be **killed** in this room!

\---Nirina’s perspective---

My besuited husband hurriedly scoops the last few spoonfuls of his breakfast into his mouth without getting any on his Terran green, blue and black clothing before standing and turning to face the absolutely adorable, nervous Battan girl who’s just appeared from the direction of our door and started in surprise upon seeing him.

“Apologies, Your Highness…” he smiles, toothlessly “…you’re a little earlier than scheduled and you caught me finishing my breakfast.”

The cute little, friendshaped, Wombat-Gibbon in a princess outfit (who I could just eat up for *my* breakfast, not that I’m stupid enough to *say* so to her) looks dismayed at my husband’s words, answering “My *deepest* apologies, Representative! I could leave and come ba-”

“Nonsense!” I interrupt, warmly, coming to my husband’s side and raising my palm to greet her “We are *delighted* to receive you presently and will take your slightly overprompt arrival as a *compliment*, Your Highness.”

She raises a pawhand on the end of a proportionally long and thick arm to match my greeting.

The action reveals that she has had the razor-sharp tips of her claws rounded off, removing their ability to act as offensive weapons the way her aunt used *hers* to mark my husband’s beautiful face.

My heart sinks a little at the thought that she might have blunted them for *our* benefit.

Simply not using them to *attack* us would have been enough. She didn’t need to go **that** far!

Unfortunately, the line between submission and friendship is often not as *clearcut* as one might like…

Many gardenworlders very much struggle to understand the notion that Terrans don’t need or want friends who are constantly grovelling or abasing themselves for us… or that doing so is actually quite *offputting* in Terran culture.

Not allowing any of the mild discomfort I just experienced to show on my face or in my voice, I gesture to the lounge area and sweetly suggest “Shall we sit down and begin, Your Highness? Or, would you like anything to refresh yourself with beforehand? If you want something we don’t have, we can arrange to have it brought here…”

She frowns and turns her eyes downwards, clearly unwillingly saying “I shouldn’t like to impose on your hospitality, Representative and Ambassador Rain. We can-”

“No imposition at *all*!” beams my husband, clearly having seen exactly what I saw but being just marginally quicker on the draw than I was “In fact, it would be our *pleasure* to accommodate you! Please! Choose *anything* you like!”

Looking back up, hopefully, she hesitates “In… *that* case… would it be alright to have a glass of… *orange* juice?”

Working hard to suppress the way I want to laugh at the humble request, I answer “Of *course*, Your Highness! If you take a seat, I’ll bring it to you.”

Then a thought occurs to me.

The UTCIS informs us that this girl has lived her entire life on the Battan homeworld… which does *not* allow the import of any Terran goods… meaning she’s almost *certainly* never had orange juice.

“Have you ever had it *before*?” I ask, as I make my way to the stasis fridge “We may need to just check that there won’t be any nasty surprises in introducing citric acid and such to your physiology.”

I can only *imagine* how bad it would be if she needed to visit regen because her snout was half melted by a drink we’d given her on her first visit!

“I haven’t but I know it’s safe for me to drink.” she states.

With my back to her, I frown slightly, wondering how exactly she knows *that*.

“If you’re sure, Your Highness.” I say, opening the fridge door. My hand reaches out and hovers between the two bottles of citrus juice there are there as I add “Would you prefer *pulp* or *no* pulp?”

“Pulp please, Ambassador… If that’s *alright*?” the adorable girl requests.

“No problem at *all*, Your Highness.” I say reassuringly as I smirk and pick up my husband’s preferred variety.

I shut the door and produce a glass from the cupboard, pouring the juice into it until mostly full and stopping.

“Would you like ice, Your Highness?”

“Yes please, Ambassador.” she answers.

Placing the glass on a little shelf on the front of the fridge door, I press the top button twice.

Immediately, the small cubic chamber just above the lip of the glass is filled with water which is instantly chilled to −40°C, freezing it solid.

The icecube is gently ejected into the drink, followed a moment later by another.

I turn and make my way around the kitchen counter to the lounge area.

I feel a tiny pang of disappointment at the fact that the girl has already mounted the high seated armchair we had brought here for her, designed to put her eye level between mine and my husband’s with us all sitting.

I had been looking forward to watching her climb up the steps to it (which I’m sure was *extremely* adorable!)

I’ll just have to wait to watch her climb back down.

I extend the glass to her hand and wait until I can feel she’s got ahold of it before I let go.

I round the low coffee table to take a seat next to my husband on the couch.

He raises his right ankle to rest atop his left knee, his long thighs keeping his 45cm shoes far away from the front of my dress.

He brings a 31cm long hand to rest atop my left shoulder over my head.

We both smile forward at the princess as she takes her first sip of orange juice.

Her face immediately twists in seeming disgust.

I’m halfway up from my seat, saying “Your Highness, I can get you something *else* if-”

“No! It’s *good*!… It’s *better* than good, actually!” she refuses, subconsciously withdrawing the drink to protect it from the notion of being taken away “I just… wasn’t expecting it to be quite so… *astringent*! It took me by *surprise* is all.”

“Ah… *Yes*!” chuckles my husband “That would be the citric acid my wife mentioned. To Humans at least, it is the purest, most concentrated, taste of sour there *is*(!)… I once made a recipe that called for a small amount of powdered citric acid and dropped just two grains of it onto the work surface. Thinking they would be to sourness as two grains of sugar would to sweetness or two grains of salt to saltiness, I pressed my  finger down onto them and brought them up to my tongue.” he mimes the action “Only to be wracked with immediate regret as the sensation of being *forcefed* an entire **lemon** hit me in an *instant*!”

The girl gives an absolutely heartmelting giggle at my husbands mildly selfdeprecating story before observing “It tastes completely *different* to the way it does in VR. \**eep*\*”  emitting an almost imperceptible squeak matched by a very slight tense of her body, her black eyes looking as if they might have swivelled towards us as she freezes midsip.

“I’m sure it *would*, Your Highness.” I say nonchalantly, pretending not to have realised the significance of her letting slip that she has played full dive games that feature Terran orange juice on a world that prohibits the import of any Terran products, physical or digital, but making a note of it to discuss with Ndum after she leaves “Shall we begin now?… Would you mind telling why you requested to meet us so soon after you arrived on Citadel? As pleased as we are to host you, I don’t imagine you’ve even seen your own people’s *embassy* yet?”

Transitioning from the nerves about her little slipup before to new discomfort, the girl says “Yes… It’s about… what my aunt did to your face, Representative.” looking to my husband, apologetically.

“This?” he smiles, raising a long forefinger to point to the marks (that the PR department advised him **never** to regen away, given their value to the Terran brand!) and waving that hand dismissively “I hold no grudge at **all** about it! Don’t worry! I know that your aunt had been… shall we say ‘*hardening*’ as she entrenched herself against myself and my predecessors. She snapped and I simply had the misfortune to be on the receiving end of it when that happened. The fact that His Majesty immediately recalled her and dispatched you in her stead proves that her actions (and her *words*!) were her own and not representative of some deeper conspiracy against my kind!”

Looking slightly relieved, the girl says “*Indeed* they **weren**’**t**! However, my father (on my advice) still wished for me to come here and \[untranslatable idiom: roll in the dust. Nearest approx.: clear the air\] with you…”

I smile sweetly “You may consider the air *cleared*, Your Highness. Your Representativeship makes a **more** than adequate peace offering as far as *we*’*re* concerned!”

“Regardless…” she states, slotting the half full glass of orange juice into the cupholder in the arm of her high seat “…my father wishes me to relate the following… **on** the understanding that, while this must obviously be parleyed among your government, diplomacy and intelligence sectors to have any point at all, nothing I am about to tell you is to be made public to your people or the wider galaxy.”

“You have our *word*, Your Highness.” my husband says without hesitation.

“Indeed.” I agree.

She closes her eyes and leans her stocky torso against the seatback, taking a deep inhale before saying “The Battan Kingdom will begin quietly dismantling its antiTerran position in the galaxy.”

My mouth falls open in utter **shock** but I manage to force it closed just a moment before the girl opens her eyes again.

“Please don’t expect immediate *miracles*! My father cannot suddenly announce the wholesale repeal of the trade embargo, the galnet restrictions etc. as doing so would be potentially destabilising to his rule and might entice one of his cousin’s to rise in rebellion and press their claim on the throne… However, King Tratholt LXV of Batta has come to realise that opposing your people for the *sake* of opposing them serves *neither* of our peoples’ interests!… As the first step of this process, he has instructed me to vote with my conscience on issues that come before us in Parliament, Representative… though, that is with the *caveat* that I can’t make this about face in our policy **too** obvious, so I may *sometimes* need to vote against your position, even when I don’t want to… Over the coming years, trade restrictions will be eased though it may take decades, if ever, for relations to have normalised to the point where we can allow a Terran ambassador onto Batta… I *hope* this news pleases you?”

Both of us in stunned silence, it’s several long moments before my (normally very suave and witty) husband manages to stammer “**Y**\-**yes**! Indeed it does, Your Highness! If I knew that such a development would come at merely the cost of a few scratches on my cheek, I would gladly submit to them *again*… a **thousand** times(!)”

The girl giggles “That *won*’*t* be necessary, Representative(!)” then raises her glass of orange juice in a very Terran looking toast and says “Here’s to the start of what I hope to be a long and prosperous relationship…” before bringing it to her lips and taking a sip.

I am a millennial who has always been told to fear having any photos or explicit content anywhere that could be recorded. But I also really could use some stress relief... I tried doing a few searches for advice but couldn't find anything helpful amongst all of the adult websites and ads...

If I draw a line at refusing video chats, am I limiting my dating pool too much? Or is there a platform that folks use that would waylay my privacy fears?",0,1754765886.0,Bumble,10,0.33,False
1mlx90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mlx90c/explore_if_the_qhh_cold_brew_coffee_maker_is_the/,Explore if the QHH Cold Brew Coffee Maker is the ultimate iced coffee solution review,"**Testing the QHH Cold Brew Coffee Maker**

The QHH Cold Brew Coffee Maker, model ""cold brew coffee maker,"" became my companion for chilly mornings and lazy weekend beverages. With its sturdy build and an impressive capacity of 64 ounces, this glass mason jar pitcher with a stainless-steel filter seemed both practical and stylish. The heavy-duty airtight glass was an instant win for me—durable yet sleek enough to look great sitting on the kitchen counter. And, let me say, the blend of simplicity and functionality had my coffee brewing routine feeling effortless.

**Features That Stand Out**

What caught my attention immediately was the stainless-steel filter with its fine 160-micron weave. As someone perpetually annoyed by unexpected coffee grounds sneaking into my drink, this feature was a lifesaver. It worked exceptionally well, ensuring my cold brew remained smooth and grit-free every single time. It didn't just stop at coffee though—I used the same filter to strain tea leaves, and it even handled fruit pits seamlessly when I made infused water. The versatility here really added a bonus element to an already solid design.

**A Look Into The Design**

The first thing anyone would notice is how user-friendly this mason jar pitcher is. Its thoughtfully designed lid comes equipped with a pour spout and an ergonomic handle that felt comfortable and secure in my grip. The spout didn’t dribble or drip, a problem I’ve experienced with other pitchers. Plus, the silicone gasket kept the jar airtight in the fridge, locking in freshness for longer. I didn’t have to worry about spills or funky fridge smells mingling with my carefully brewed coffee. This design choice ensured my drinks stayed tasting exactly as they should.

**Advantages**

- The reusable filter is made of high-quality food-grade stainless steel, ensuring durability and long-term use.  
- Cleaning was incredibly straightforward, even when I used it for sticky juices like lemonade.  
- The large 64oz capacity was perfect for preparing enough coffee or tea to last for days.  

**Less Ideal Aspects**

Admittedly, the glass jar's resistance to temperature changes left me cautious. Transitioning from hot to cold liquids isn’t recommended, so avoid pouring freshly boiled water directly into the jar. Also, while the heavy-duty glass looks and feels great, it makes the pitcher slightly bulky and heavy when full, especially for those with smaller hands.

- Care is needed while handling due to its weight when filled.  
- Not suitable for extreme temperature shifts, so no spontaneous hot-to-cold experiments.  

**Performance Results Over Time**

After weeks of testing, the QHH cold brew pitcher consistently delivered smooth, bold flavors. Steeping coffee grounds overnight was a pleasure, and I found the end result just as good—if not better—than some café-quality cold brews. While I primarily focused on coffee, it also handled tea and lemonade masterfully. My experiment with sun tea during an extra sunny weekend was a highlight; the wide mouth allowed easy addition of sliced fruits without struggle, and the jar didn’t stain despite prolonged exposure to tannins.

**Product Alternatives**

Comparing this cold brew coffee maker to alternatives like the Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Maker, I’d say they offer comparable quality, but this jar clearly wins in terms of capacity and extra features like the superior spout and silicone sealing ring. While the Takeya model is lighter and less prone to breakage, the QHH's elegant design and high-density filter elevate it for enthusiasts who value versatility and quality in brewing. Another close competitor, the Oxo Good Grips Cold Brew Maker, boasts a unique rainmaker lid for brewing, but its smaller volume might disappoint larger households. In short, the QHH pitcher shines on the aesthetic and quantity fronts.

**True Value for Beverage Lovers**

This cold brew coffee maker sits comfortably in the sweet spot of affordability and functionality. Considering that this pitcher does double duty as a juice jug and even a tea infuser, I found its price point entirely reasonable for what it delivers. Sure, there are slightly cheaper options on the market, but they often lack something—be it durability or ease of pouring. The QHH model justifies an investment with its premium feel and consistent performance. If you're like me and enjoy kitchen gadgets that blend form and function, you'll find this purchase hard to regret.

My idea is to go a step further than the standard metaphysical shop and offer life coaching that integrates the spiritual, metaphysical and physical. It will be a constant source of referrals for other local service providers and businesses of different fields. The town has a lot of historical and ghost tourism that I would utilize to draw attention to my venture. Since the building shares a street front with the local risk management/ homeless shelter my focus would also include growing a sustainable food forest on the property and using volunteering as a method of healing and growth. It's currently a hippie shop so I think I can definitely turn it into something to keep it business zoned and could consider a coffee/sandwich shop since the other surrounding businesses are law and government offices. My family and I can outfit the upstairs for our living area, and husband has a full time job that would cover the loan repayment, we just don't have the credit or savings to start. Since the property is in great shape for it's age and it's location, it is a risk free investment. Home is being listed for $250k and an additional 30-50k would complete all upfitting and preparation for the business downstairs. I don't need the additional beyond the house, I could figure the rest out! I would ideally repay $3k a month for 5 years then refinance with a standard bank the remainder of house loan after that term. Let me know what you think or how I can make my idea more appealing.

I've been a night auditor off and on for the past five years and I've had my share of fascinating (derogatory) folks who have dazzled me with audacity and impressed me with their poor descision making skills. 

This particular tale is the tale of a man named Mike. Mike was a regular at our hotel starting in September of '24. I dreaded Mike. 

Mike hauled hay and livestock (i wont go into detail as it .ight give too much away). The first thing Mike said to me upon walking into the hotel his very first night was ""You want to to go roll in the hay with me?"". 

Not 'Hi, hello, how are you, I have a reservation for Mike Schmike'. Just out the gate 'wanna f**ck?'. 

Cue the awkward customer service smile, ""Checking in?"", I asked. I've worked enough terrible jobs (including a brief stint as a bouncer in college) to know better than to acknowledge that. Mike doubles down. 

""No thank you, I'm engaged. We're actually getting married next month."" This usually gets people to leave me alone.

Mike doesn't seem perturbed. I check him in and get him out of my lobby as quickly as possible. 

A week later, I see his name pop up on incoming reservation. I groan, but resolve to be as professional as possible. 

He and his cronies show up about 20 minutes before our houseman leaves. Mike makes a comment about 'the homeless guy running around our hotel' in regards to our houseman. 

Our night houseman is the nicest man whom I will die for. He doesn’t look homeless to me. He has longer hair and a bit of a beard, but it's well maintained. He is a Vietnam vet and has had a rough life, but is still a sweetie in spite of it all. 

I tell Mike ""That's Shane, our houseman, and I don't appreciate that comment.""

Mike proceeds to inform me that 'its legal to kill homeless people in Canada' (something about assisted s**cide? My gasts were throughly flabberd). I just stare at Mike, who is absolutely oblivious. I give him his keys and get him out of my lobby ASAP. 

Two weeks. Two blissful weeks. I'm about to go on break to get married. I'm minding my business when who walks in at 1:30 in the morning but our dreaded Mike. 

""I have a reservation.""
I check our system; no one under his name is on our arrivals. 
""I'm sorry, but could it be under a different name?""
I feel dread in the pit of my stomach.
Mike smirks like a cat that swallowed a canary. ""No, idiot, I made the reservation just now through [REDACTED 3RD PARTY].""
""I'm sorry,"" I say, ""But im not seeing it in our system.""
""That's bullshit, I paid for it and everything, you're just too stupid to find my reservation.""
""Let me look,"" I say, biting back my rage as I input his name. I only see past reservations. ""Hmm, I'm not seeing it. Do you have your confirmation number? I'm sure I can find it that way.""
He whips out his phone and his face contorts. 
""I forgot to hit enter."" He says, no ounce.of shame.
 
Whose the idiot now, fucker?

I get him checked in. I should have walked him the first night, but no. I'm too nice and have worked enough customer service that being sexually harassed means dick to me. 

I get married, and the hotel has over a month and a half of no Mike at the hotel! Awesome! It's like a little wedding gift to me (and my poor husband, to whom I regale these tails to when I get home). 

Late December rolls around. I see the dreaded Mike Schmike in our 'arrivals' list. I mention it to my coworker at pass down that this guy is a creep. She asks why I dont just kick him out. I told her I 'didn't really think it was an option'. 

Last check in is supposed to be 2:00 a.m., but I'm sweet, so I often will hold off until 2:30 or 3:00 if there's a few people who still haven't shown up. Especially in winter. We have a gnarly pass to the east of us, so I try to give people time to show up just in case.

Mike shows up at 2:20. He's arrogant and rude as usual. I make the joke ""Oh wow, you're lucky you showed up in time. I was about to run the audit.""
He looks at me, looks at my large beaded earrings (I'm Metis, but white passing) and tells me how 'brown people are ruining the country' (he was actually much more graphic than that, details I'm not wantong to go into because good christ). 
I'm pissed at this point. I look at him and say 'oh, like the Europeans did to the Americas?' And he frowns. 
""How do you mean?""
""Well, they came here, killed off indigenous people, took their land-""
""That's different, (Natives) were killing each other.""
""So did the Europeans. Did the Battle of Hastings mean nothing? What about Agincourt?""
I give him his keys and tell him to have a good night. 

Luckily, I don't see him again until this year. Mid spring, his name crops up on the 'arrivals' list through [REDACTED 3RD PARTY]. 

Ohfuck.jpg

I go through the night on edge. 2:00 rolls around, no sign of him. 2:30, no dice. 3:00, I go ahead and run the audit. I've been more than generous at this point. 

3:20 a.m., he comes swaggering through the door, smug smile, coffee cup in hand, teenager in tow. 
""I'm checking in."" He says, smirking down at me. 
""I'm sorry, I've already run the audit, and I can't re-instate 3rd party reservations.""
His face falls. Eyes go black. Ifykyk.
""Haha, funny joke. Now check me in.""
""I'm sorry,  I can't. Last check in is supposed to be at 2:00 a.m., I waited as long as I could for you guys.""
""You're joking."" 
""I'm not. I can make you a new reservation, but checkout will be at 11:00. I might be able to negotiate a late checkout with housek-""
""I PAID FOR THIS RESERVATION.""
""I understand that, but you didnt show up or call and tell us you'd be late. Raising your voice won't get you anywhere.""
""WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO STAY, YOU STUPID BITCH!?""
""Not. Here."" I snap, pointing to the door. ""Get out. You're not welcome back."" 
At thos point, I'm trying not to shake, trying not to cuss him out. I'm somewhere between collapse and 'try me'. 
""I PAID FOR THE ROOM, I GET TO STAY HERE."" 
""Leave. Before I call the police."" 
""YOU STOLE MY MONEY. GIVE ME MY MONEY.""
""You paid through a 3rd party. You'll have to call them and get your money back. We don't have it.""
""I WANT TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER. YOU CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.""
""SHE is asleep."" I say. ""I will not be calling HER."" I give him her card. ""But, you can call her in the morning, and she will tell you the exact same thing I did.""

He throws his half-full coffee at me, misses, and hits the desk instead. The poor teenager picks it up, apologizing profusely to Mike. Mike grabbs the cup from him and throws it at my car, parked under the awning outside. 

Mike called both my manager and the regional manager and cussed them out. Got added to the 'Do Not Rent' list as well as trespassed. Had his rewards number revoked. Left a charming review on our website saying we stole from him and I was 'snotty' and 'uppity', among a few other lovely things that slid past the censors. 

Good riddance, Mike. Go roll yourself in the hay and leave me be.

Hey Travel Trotters! Just got back from what might be the most extravagant train experience of my life, and I HAD to share it with you all! 

The Eastern & Oriental Express isn't just a train—it's a time machine to the golden age of travel. If you've been dreaming of experiencing Southeast Asia in style, this might be your dream ticket. 🎫

**The Booking Experience**
About a month before departure, I got a call from the onboard concierge (fancy, right?). They helped me plan everything from excursions to spa treatments. Pro tip: book these EARLY as the popular ones fill up fast!

**All Aboard!** 🚉
Departure day was seamless. I arranged a private transfer from my Singapore hotel to Woodlands Train Station. After clearing Malaysian immigration (super quick), I was greeted by staff in crisp uniforms on the platform. The champagne welcome definitely set the tone for what was coming!

**The Digs**
I splurged on a State Cabin, which was worth every penny. During the day, it's a cozy sitting area, and at night, it transforms into a bedroom with two single beds. My butler (yes, BUTLER) made this magic happen while I was at dinner each night.

The Pullman cabins are smaller with bunk beds, while the Presidential Suites are truly next-level luxury. All cabins have private ensuite bathrooms with showers—surprisingly good water pressure for a train!

**The Social Scene** 🍸
The real magic happens in the communal carriages. The Observation Car at the back became my favorite spot—cocktail in hand, watching Malaysia's countryside roll by from the outdoor deck. Pure bliss.

The Piano Car is where the party happens. Live music every night had everyone mixing and mingling. I made friends with couples from Australia, Germany, and Canada who I'm still in touch with!

**Let's Talk Food** 🍽️
OMG. THE FOOD. Every meal was an event. The dining cars (Malaya and Adisorn) are stunning, with table settings that would make Instagram influencers weep. 

Breakfast offers both Western and Asian options. Lunch is a three-course affair. Dinner? FOUR courses of pure culinary art. The best part? You're seated with different travelers at each meal, making every dining experience fresh and interesting.

**Sleeping on the Move** 💤
I was worried about sleeping on a moving train, but it was surprisingly comfortable. The gentle rocking actually lulled me to sleep. The cabins are well-insulated, though light sleepers might want to pack earplugs just in case.

**The Adventures** 🌴
The ""Essence of Malaysia"" route took us through Langkawi, Penang, and Ipoh. Each stop offered different excursions:

In Penang, I toured Georgetown's stunning architecture and tried my hand at a Malaysian cooking class.

Langkawi gave us a beach day with the most insane seafood lunch I've ever had.

Ipoh offered a glimpse into Malaysia's colonial past with historical tours.

All excursions are included in your fare, which makes budgeting much easier!

**The Spa Car** 💆‍♀️
New addition alert! The train now has a Dior Spa Car with two treatment rooms. I splurged on a massage after a day of exploring, and watching the countryside roll by while getting pampered was UNREAL.

**Who This Trip Is For**
Let's be honest—this isn't a budget experience. It's perfect for:
- Special celebrations (I met three anniversary couples)
- Luxury travelers looking for something unique
- Train enthusiasts (met plenty of those!)
- Anyone wanting to see Southeast Asia without the hassle of planning multiple hotels/transfers

**Things I Wish I Knew**
- Pack light! Storage is limited in cabins
- Dress code is real—smart casual during day, formal-ish for dinner
- WiFi is spotty (but honestly, the digital detox was refreshing)
- Book AT LEAST 6 months in advance for best cabin selection

**Final Thoughts** ⭐
This journey isn't just about getting from A to B—it's about savoring every moment in between. From watching sunrise over palm plantations with coffee in hand to clinking glasses with new friends under starlight, the Eastern & Oriental Express delivers memories that last a lifetime.

Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.

She had gas troubles at the start of her life and colic that had us so sleep deprived and trying all the things, but all of that has settled now and other than general fussiness sometimes, she’s lovely to hang out with. 

However. This girl LOATHES the car seat. We used to be able to drive until she fell asleep, even if that took some screaming, but that doesn’t work anymore. She refuses to sleep in it and when we attach it to the stroller she still just screams. We used to be able to put her to sleep and go for nice walks, or even just have her awake and looking around happily for 20ish minutes at a time. It was crucial for my mental health to just get out of the house with her, get a coffee, drive around, and walk. It was my one time of day where I wasn’t having her physically touching me. 

We tried a convertible car seat, thinking it was the bucket seat that she hated. No dice. She screamed in that one and then we had to try to transfer her back to the bucket seat once we got to our destination anyways. We switched back for the sake of ease at this point because if she’s gonna be screaming anyways, I’d rather be able to get her out of the car as quickly as possible. 

I don’t know what changed overall - we are definitely in the midst of the 4 month sleep regression, so maybe that’s contributing? And I know babies are constantly changing and growing. But I’m feeling SO discouraged and sad. I just want to go do things with her but when we can’t even go for a dog walk without her screaming, I feel like I can never leave the house. I feel trapped and like I’m doing something wrong when I see other people with babies quietly dozing in the stroller or just content looking around.

Hey folks,

I’m the founder of Bangalore Newbies, a community I started in Oct 2023 that’s now done 400–500 events. 

Over the past year, I’ve met so many people who just wanted a place to hang out, make friends, and have fun without all the awkward networking vibes or swipe culture. I want to help create a space that’s accessible and welcoming to everyone. Somewhere we can make friends as adults without the pressure of always having to be our best. 

So… we’re starting Make it Real.

We’re building a webapp for it, but that’ll take a bit more time. I thought, Why wait? 

We’re starting right now.

What’s the idea?

A third space in Bangalore where you can meet people, try cool activities, and actually enjoy being present.

What sets us apart?

	•	No cameras, no phones during events
	•	Small groups so conversations actually happen
	•	Safe, welcoming spaces with people who just want to connect
	•	Budget-friendly but interesting experiences

What’s coming up this month?

Here are some of the events we’ve put together for you.

	•	Make your own Ganapati workshop
	•	Paint and brunch
	•	Exclusive jam session
	•	Food walk and restaurant takeover
	•	Dave and Buster’s night
	•	Heritage walk
	•	Curated matcha and coffee experience
	•	Exclusive improv session

Pricing:

A ₹300 one-time access fee, redeemable against your first event. After that, you just pay for the events you attend. We’re keeping it transparent and affordable.

If you’ve been wanting to meet new people in the city without the usual pressure, this is for you. Comment or DM me to join, we keep events small, so spots go fast.

Posting here because we have a lot of events planned in and around Indiranagar too. 

TL;DR: We’re launching Make it Real, a no-camera, no-phone, safe third space in Bangalore to meet new people and try fun activities. ₹300 one-time fee (redeemable), then pay per event. We have exciting plans for just this month. ",6,1754765308.0,indiranagar,1,1.0,False

# Best Folding Reading Glasses 2025: Reviews & Expert Guide

Folding reading glasses have become increasingly popular in recent years,offering a convenient and portable solution for those who require vision correction for close-up tasks. In today's fast-paced world, the ability to easily carry and access reading glasses is invaluable. This guide explores the best folding reading glasses available in 2025, providing detailed reviews and expert insights to help you make an informed decision.We will cover key features, benefits, and comparisons to other options, ensuring you find the perfect pair for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of folding reading glasses lies in a combination of design, material, and lens quality. Understanding these key features is crucial to selecting the right pair for optimal vision and convenience.

**compact Folding Design:** The primary feature of these glasses is their ability to fold into a significantly smaller size,making them incredibly portable.

This is achieved through a combination of carefully designed hinges and a frame that collapses efficiently. The size reduction varies between models,but the best ones can fit comfortably in a small pocket or wallet. The mechanism needs to be robust enough to withstand repeated folding and unfolding without loosening or breaking. High-quality hinges are essential for long-term durability.

**Lens Material and Clarity:** The quality of the lenses directly impacts the user's visual experience.

Common lens materials include polycarbonate and acrylic,with polycarbonate offering greater impact resistance. Lens clarity is measured by its Abbe number, with higher numbers indicating less chromatic aberration (color distortion).Anti-reflective coatings are also beneficial, reducing glare and improving contrast, making reading more pleasant, especially in shining light. High-quality lenses are crucial for preventing eye strain and ensuring accurate vision correction.

**Frame Material and Durability:** The frame material determines the glasses' overall strength, adaptability, and weight.

Common materials include stainless steel, titanium, and various plastics like TR90. Stainless steel is known for its durability and resistance to corrosion,while titanium is lightweight and hypoallergenic. TR90 is a flexible and durable plastic that can withstand notable bending without breaking. The frame must be able to withstand daily wear and tear, including accidental drops and being stored in tight spaces.The choice of material affects not only durability but also the overall comfort and style of the glasses.

**Reading Power Options:** The availability of different reading power options allows users to select the appropriate magnification for their specific needs.

Reading powers are typically measured in diopters, ranging from +1.00 to +3.50 or higher, in increments of 0.25. It's essential to choose the correct reading power to avoid eye strain and ensure clear vision at the desired reading distance. Some brands offer a wider range of powers than others, catering to a broader spectrum of users. Consulting an eye care professional is recommended to determine the appropriate reading power for individual needs.

**Protective Case and Portability:** A well-designed protective case is essential for safeguarding the glasses when they are not in use.

The case should be compact and lightweight to maintain the portability of the glasses. It should also provide adequate protection against scratches, impacts, and dust. Some cases feature a magnetic closure for easy access, while others use a snap or zipper. The material of the case, such as leather or hard plastic, contributes to its overall durability and aesthetic appeal. A good case ensures that the glasses remain in pristine condition, ready for use whenever needed.

## Core Benefits

Folding reading glasses offer several practical benefits, improving convenience and enhancing the user experience for those who require reading correction.

**Enhanced Portability and Convenience:** The primary advantage of folding reading glasses is their compact size when folded, making them incredibly easy to carry.Unlike conventional reading glasses that can be bulky and difficult to store, folding glasses can fit easily into a pocket, purse, or wallet.This means you always have access to your reading glasses whenever you need them, whether you're reading a menu at a restaurant, checking your phone, or working on a document while traveling.The convenience factor significantly improves the user's daily life, removing the hassle of carrying bulky glasses cases.

**Discreet and Stylish Design:** Modern folding reading glasses are available in a wide range of stylish designs.

Many models feature sleek, minimalist frames that blend seamlessly with any outfit. The compact folding mechanism is often discreetly integrated into the design,ensuring that the glasses don't look bulky or awkward. The availability of various colors and frame shapes allows users to choose a pair that complements their personal style. This combination of functionality and aesthetics makes folding reading glasses an attractive option for those who value both convenience and appearance.**On-the-Go Reading Solution:** Folding reading glasses are perfect for individuals who need vision correction while traveling or engaging in activities outside the home.Whether you're reading a book on a plane, browsing through a tourist map, or working on a laptop in a coffee shop, folding glasses provide a convenient and reliable solution. Their compact size and easy portability make them ideal for situations where space is limited or when carrying a bulky glasses case is impractical. This makes them an essential accessory for frequent travelers, students, and anyone who needs vision correction on the go.**Reduced Risk of Damage:** The protective case that typically accompanies folding reading glasses minimizes the risk of scratches, impacts, and other forms of damage.

When folded and stored in their case, the glasses are shielded from accidental bumps and bruises that can occur when carrying them loosely. This reduces the likelihood of needing to replace or repair the glasses, saving you money in the long run. The protective case also helps to keep the lenses clean and free from dust, ensuring optimal vision quality whenever you need to use them.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about folding reading glasses:

**Are folding reading glasses as durable as regular reading glasses?**
While folding reading glasses are designed for portability, high-quality models are surprisingly durable. The key is in the construction of the hinges and the materials used for the frame and lenses. Look for models with robust hinges and durable frame materials like stainless steel or TR90. With proper care and storage in their protective case, folding reading glasses can last just as long as regular reading glasses.

**Can I get prescription lenses in folding reading glasses?**
Yes, it is indeed possible to get prescription lenses in some folding reading glasses. However, the availability of prescription options may vary depending on the brand and model. It's best to consult with an eye care professional or contact the manufacturer directly to inquire about prescription lens options. Not all frames are suitable for prescription lenses due to their design and size limitations.

**How do I choose the right reading power for folding reading glasses?**
The correct reading power depends on your individual vision needs and the distance at which you typically read. It's recommended to consult with an eye care professional to determine the appropriate reading power for you. They can perform an eye exam and provide a prescription that specifies the correct diopter for your reading glasses. you can also try using an online vision test as a preliminary guide, but it should not replace a professional eye exam.

**Are folding reading glasses suitable for all face shapes?**
Folding reading glasses come in a variety of frame shapes and sizes, so it's possible to find a pair that suits your face shape. However, not all styles are universally flattering. Consider your face shape and choose a frame style that complements your features. Such as,round faces often look good with angular or rectangular frames,while square faces benefit from round or oval frames. Trying on different styles (if possible) is the best way to determine which ones look best on you.

He Called it True Love Novel

Chapter 1
On our seventh wedding anniversary, the gift my husband Gary Perez sent after standing me up was a newborn still slick with amniotic fluid.
I ignored the wails outside and dumped a table of cold dishes.
Gary called, ""Got the kid? Stop targeting Kathleen Davis now. She even gave you her child—what more do you want?""
""Be reasonable. If you could bear children, would I have sought another woman?""
""The Perez bloodline's hung by a thread for seven generations. Raise mine and Kathleen's child well while I accompany her abroad. I'll make it up with a wedding when we return.""
I answered calmly, ""Fine.""
Then contacted a slum couple in Africa: ""Heard you want to adopt?""
Just then, a message flashed: ""Elizabeth Harris, marry me or I'll die.""
My cold gaze swept the empty house as I replied, ""I will.""
The other party called excitedly, ""I'll pick you up!""
Three years later, due to company expansion, I returned to San Francisco with my child.
Yet at the airport, I unexpectedly ran into Gary and Kathleen, who had just arrived from abroad.
Gary shoved his suitcase toward me as if it were natural. ""At least you've got some sense. How'd you know Kathleen and I were returning today?""
Before I could respond, he frowned impatiently. ""Why have your messages been so incomplete these years? But asking for living expenses? Always straight to the point!""
I raised an eyebrow. When I left back then, I'd casually tossed my phone to a homeless person on the street. Who knew who'd been replying to him?
I couldn't be bothered to engage and threw his suitcase back.
""You've got the wrong person.""
I turned to leave, but then Kathleen saw the child sleeping in the stroller and rushed over in tears.
""Son, Mommy's back. It's all my fault that I met your dad too late, so I couldn't be by your side legitimately.""
Then, she ignored my attempts to stop her and forcibly picked up the child.
The child, who inherited his biological father's grumpiness upon waking, immediately burst into loud wails.
Struggling wildly, his little feet kicked Kathleen in the face.
Crying and calling out ""Mommy"" to me, Kathleen's eyes flashed with panic and jealousy.
I hurried over to take the child back and was about to explain, ""He's not your chi...""
But Kathleen took a step back, crying like a rain-drenched blossom, ""Elizabeth, you clearly promised me that you would take good care of my child. Why is he so thin and small at three years old?""
She then said to the child in her arms, ""It's all mommy's fault. I haven't been with you for three years, never knew you suffered so much!""
I was so exasperated I nearly rolled my eyes. Just as I opened my mouth to say, ""You've misunderstood, he's only two—""
A stinging slap landed across my face. I stared at Gary in disbelief.
His face twisted with rage. ""Elizabeth, I never imagined you'd be this vicious! You promised back then, yet for three years you've abused my child with Kathleen!""
""I've sent you nearly a million in living expenses over three years, and you couldn't even spare proper food for him?""
""Look how thin and dark he's become under your cruelty! This is the sole heir of the Perez family!""
A crowd had gathered around us unnoticed, all rolling their eyes and whispering behind their hands.
Even people held up their phones live-streaming, shouting, ""Come quick, everyone! An evil nanny got caught red-handed abusing a rich family's child!""
Frowning, I watched the still-crying child, my heart aching as I snatched him back from Kathleen.
Chapter 2
Busy comforting the child, I had no time to explain to the crowd. Suddenly, Kathleen screamed, ""Elizabeth, how could you use a Herbal Sleep Pillow for the baby? Don’t you know I’m allergic to it?""
""No wonder he’s so frail! He’s allergic just like me. Elizabeth, didn’t you notice at all?""
""That poor little thing couldn’t speak, suffering silently for three years... After all, he’s not her biological—""
Then she knelt before me, putting on a show of motherly devotion. ""Please give my son back! He’s the child I struggled so hard to bring into this world!""
I thought bitterly about how that newborn had been dumped at the doorstep like unwanted goods, still slick with birth fluids.
Gary and Kathleen flaunted their honeymoon abroad on social media without sparing my dignity, their public displays turning me into the circle's laughingstock.
Had I not heard those wails, that infant would've frozen to death outside.
You couldn't bother feeding your own child back then, yet now you playact devoted parents?
My expression hardened as I placed the baby back in the stroller.
Gary snapped, ""Elizabeth, give Kathleen her child! You can't even handle childcare properly—you're unfit to be Mrs. Perez!""
I smirked, ""Who cares? I've remarried already!""
""Kathleen holds a Harvard master's degree. She's more qualified than you to lead the Perez group. If not for my consideration...""
Gary was chattering away when he finally registered my words, stammering: ""What did you say?""
Kathleen stood nearby, offering understanding: ""Elizabeth, how could you say such hurtful things? I never meant to compete with you. I'd be content just staying by Gary and the child.""
Gary movedly grasped Kathleen's hand. ""You've always been thoughtful.""
Then he looked me up and down, sneering: ""Every single luxury item on you—which one wasn't bought with my money? And you talk about remarrying?""
""Who else could give you this lavish lifestyle?""
""Elizabeth, the Perez group isn't what it used to be. If you want to keep living like this, you'd better treat Kathleen with respect!""
""From now on, Kathleen will move in to bond with the child.""
""Since you can't raise them properly, let their real mother do it!""
A glint of triumph flashed in Kathleen's eyes as she looked at me. I couldn't be bothered with them and looked down at the message from Dylan Baker: ""Sweetheart, I've got one more business deal to wrap up in Europe. Thanks for taking care of the kids these days. I'll make it up to you when I get back!""
Then, eighty million dollars was deposited into my bank account.
""Take yourself out for afternoon tea, my love.""
After that, he sent a 'praise me' emoji.
The frustration in my chest instantly melted away. I typed with a smile: ""Focus on your work. I'll be waiting for you.""
But then, as soon as I looked up, I saw Kathleen feeding chocolate to the child.
""Come on, son, try this chocolate Mommy brought back from abroad. Tell me if it's good.""
I dashed over and knocked the chocolate out of her hand, my face flushed with anger. ""He can't eat chocolate.""
Suddenly, Kathleen threw herself backward and screamed, ""Ah! Gary, help me!""
Gary pushed me away to help Kathleen.
I lost my balance and fell to the ground.
The curses around grew louder, ""How can there be such a wicked nanny who won’t even let the birth mother hold her child!""
""She’s clearly rotten to the core! Can’t you see she’s dressed more lavishly than the mistress? Probably embezzled loads from her employer over the years!""
Chapter 3
""...""
A bratty kid actually poured coffee on me, ""Beat the bad lady!""
My phone got knocked away during the scuffle, and that brat picked it up to smash it playfully.
My expression darkened. I’d rushed back this time without bodyguards, never expecting this chaos.
I said firmly to the crowd, ""I’m not the nanny. This is my child with my current husband.""
But the accusations kept drowning out my explanations.
I struggled to stand up, trying to leave with my child first.
Unexpectedly, someone pinned me to the ground.
Gary's leather shoes appeared before me as he looked down condescendingly. ""Apologize to Kathleen.""
I fought violently, only to be slapped by Gary. ""Elizabeth, Kathleen is carrying my child. She's the hero of our Perez family.""
""Keeping you as Mrs. Perez is already giving you enough respect. If you dare bully Kathleen using your position as my wife, everything you have can be taken away anytime.""
For some reason, my mind flashed back to that night three years ago—when I'd eagerly waited for Gary's return, only to learn about his child with Kathleen.
Gary had promised me before leaving home that what happened with Kathleen was just a slip-up. He'd cut ties with her and come back to our family.
My heart was already shattered, but I gave him another chance only because his mother once saved my life.
Yet I never imagined Gary would abandon our infant to me—treating me like a nanny—just to accompany Kathleen abroad for her studies.
The thought fueled my rage, and I struggled fiercely against his grip.
Then Kathleen hypocritically helped me up. ""Gary, let Elizabeth go. I don't blame her.""
She smugly rubbed her belly. ""After all, I've been hired by the Baker group. When things get busy, I'll still need big sister's help at home.""
My eyes darkened. ""Which Baker group?""
Seeing me ask this, Kathleen grew even more smug. ""Elizabeth, have you seriously lost your edge after all these years raising kids? Look around San Francisco—is there any other Baker group?""
""My direct boss is Dylan, the wealthiest man in New York.""
""Later, I'll just coax my boss a little, and he'll hand over billion-dollar contracts to the Perezes. Gary's company will definitely thrive.""
Gary held Kathleen in a doting embrace and kissed her. ""Kathleen's our little hero!""
He then looked at me scornfully. ""Hear that? Demand an apology from Kathleen now?""
I curled my lips and stated flat-out, ""She'll never get into the Baker group.""
Back then, Dylan nearly blew these scumbags away. If I hadn't felt indebted to the Perezes and stopped him desperately, the Perez group would've been crushed by Dylan ages ago.
Still your boss?
How could Dylan allow someone who hurt me into the Baker group?
Their faces paled. Kathleen protested indignantly, ""How dare you say that?""
I cast a cool glance at them. ""Because I'm Dylan's wife.""
Before I finished, Gary ordered bodyguards to drag me out of the airport and shove me into a car. ""You're my woman. Who said you could fantasize about another man?""
""Seems I've been too lenient with you!""
I was hauled back to the Perez manor and forced to kneel before the cemetery.
Gary pulled out a thorned whip and savagely struck me.
""Years ago, my mother saved you. She pitied your suffering and made me marry you into the Perez family.""
""Have I ever mistreated you? I only got involved with Kathleen to continue the Perez bloodline. Yet you dare defy wifely duties, claiming to be another man's wife?""
Chapter 4
""Do you even see me as your husband!""
My eyes reddened. He'd pursued me relentlessly for three years before I accepted him. I poured my entire inheritance into the Perez group.
I never forgot the family's kindness—after marriage, I devoted myself to homemaking, becoming his steadfast support.
Even knowing I struggled with fertility, he vowed to have only me for life.
Yet he broke that oath. Now he forced divorce to marry Kathleen, just to get a spouse visa for her studies abroad!
The wounds on my back burned, but I stared defiantly at Gary. ""We're already divorced.""
Gary froze, confusion flickering in his eyes before his expression softened. ""Just a paper divorce. We'll remarry after the wedding ceremony.""
Kathleen's face twisted with resentment beside them. She suddenly scooped up the child, voice dripping with false sorrow, ""Gary, perhaps I shouldn't live with you anymore. I wouldn't want to affect your marriage with Elizabeth.""
Seeing me being bullied, the child bit hard into Kathleen's arm.
Kathleen screamed in pain and actually flung the child away.
I dashed desperately but couldn't reach in time. The child hit the ground, sobbing in pain.
I gathered the child into my arms, guilt pouring down my cheeks in heavy tears. ""Baby, where does it hurt? Tell Mommy.""
Gary carefully examined Kathleen's hand before grabbing the child by the collar in fury. ""What have you taught this child? How dare he bite! As his father, I'll discipline him properly today!""
""Someone! Tie him to the pillar outside! He stays there until he learns who his real mother is!""
My pupils froze. ""Gary, you can't do this to my child!""
""It's snowing outside, they'll freeze!""
Gary dragged me into the cubicle and ripped open my clothes.
Rage filled his eyes. ""I haven't been exercising my husbandly rights enough, letting you run wild!""
He immediately started gnawing at my chest.
I slapped him across the face, eyes red. ""Gary, you'll regret this!""
Gary wiped his mouth and bellowed, ""Regret?""
""Once Kathleen joins the Baker group and I partner with Dylan, the Perez group will rise to the next tier overnight. Serve me properly now, or you'll be the one regretting it!""
I gritted my teeth. ""That's Dylan's child! Treat us like this, and he'll destroy you!""
Gary tore my pants apart in a rage, like a mad wolf, ""You're truly insane, still spouting nonsense! If I don't discipline you properly, you'll dare openly harm Kathleen next!""
He was about to strike when a scream and child's wail echoed outside.
Gary immediately zipped up and rushed out to investigate.
""Gary, I just wanted the child to call me mom. He kicked my belly, so I accidentally hit him once.""
I charged over hysterically, saw the child's swollen red cheek, and swung a brick at Kathleen's head, ""Touch my child? I'll end you!""
Gary instantly kicked my stomach and frantically held Kathleen, ""Kathleen, are you hurt?""
Kathleen clutched her stomach, whispering weakly: ""Gary, I'm in so much pain. Are the baby and I going to die?""
""Maybe death would be better. Then I wouldn't have to hide while following you anymore. Gary, promise you'll care for my child after I'm gone... even if they never accept me as their real mother...""
Chapter 5
Gary went wild, holding Kathleen tightly. ""I won't let anything happen to you! The private doctor's coming!""
He then turned and looked at me like I was already dead, his voice cruel. ""You dared teach our child to hurt Kathleen.""
His eyes swept over our child wailing nonstop while tied to the pillar. My heart plummeted.
His voice was icy cold. ""Bring the whip soaked in salt water!""
I rushed over in panic and grabbed Gary's arm. ""Gary! Don't do this to my child! Whatever you want, do it to me!""
With just one look from him, bodyguards pinned me down.
""Crack—""
The child's screams nearly shattered my eardrums. Breaking free from the bodyguards, I clung to Gary's leg and begged: ""No! Don't hit him! I'm sorry, it's all my fault! Please don't hit him!""
Gary kicked me away and struck again with the whip. He pressed the child's head coldly: ""Say it. Who's your real mother?""
The child convulsed in pain, yet still turned tear-filled eyes to me and whimpered ""Mom"" in utter misery.
My heart shattered into countless pieces as I knelt before Gary, banging my head against the ground.
""Please, spare the child! I'll do anything you ask!""
Gary pointed at Kathleen playing dead beside him. ""You disfigured Kathleen. Should I teach you how to make this right?""
Immediately I grabbed a brick and slammed it against my own head—once, twice, again and again.
Time blurred until blood covered my eyes, darkness flickering across my vision. As I fainted, Gary's coaxing voice reached Kathleen: ""Kathleen, feeling better now?""
""Not yet. Let's feed him to the wolves in the back mountains, yeah?""
Waking in the chill, I heard the child whimpering beside me, breaths growing shallower.
And wolves surrounded us all around!
I held the child and ran desperately, but was still surrounded by the wolves.
Just as the wolves lunged at us, I pressed the child tightly against my chest and closed my eyes in despair...
And at that moment, the roar of countless helicopters filled the sky above the Perez manor.
A week later, Kathleen in a fitted business suit stood before Gary, twirling around, ""Gary, how do I look in this outfit?""
""For a company like the Baker group, should I dress more elegantly?""
But Gary was somewhat distracted; somehow, the image of Elizabeth's red eyes when she was thrown into the mountains always flashed through his mind.
Every time he thought about it, his heart ached uncontrollably.
In fact, he had missed Elizabeth terribly these past three years.
He hadn't returned for three years because of Kathleen, so Elizabeth was naturally upset. He really shouldn't have treated her like that right after coming back.
Gary immediately decided to cancel the punishment. Even though he'd sent people to protect the mother and child, there were wolves in the back mountains—too dangerous.
When Elizabeth returned, he'd remarry her immediately and hold a proper wedding.
That way, Elizabeth probably wouldn't sulk at him anymore, he thought.
Yet Kathleen kept chattering beside him. Gary frowned impatiently, ""He's your own son! Aren't you worried at all? Still fussing over what to wear?""
Kathleen froze, about to explain, when the assistant rushed in. ""President, Madam sent a child to Africa for adoption three years ago...""
The door was suddenly kicked open, and a crowd flooded in.
The leader had snake-like eyes but wore a smirk, staring at Gary as if looking at a corpse. Gary’s eyes widened instantly.
A dark gun muzzle pressed against Gary’s forehead. ""Where are my wife and son?""",1,1754764665.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1mlwlzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mlwlzz/mr_polite/,Mr. Polite,"I’ve heard it said that the scariest people are the ones who never raise their voice.
If that’s true, then Mr. Polite is the scariest man I’ve ever met.

⸻

I work the night shift at a small, family-owned diner off Route 57. It’s one of those places that hasn’t changed in decades — the kind with faded booths, flickering neon signs, and a jukebox that only works when you kick it.

We don’t get many customers after 2 AM. Usually, it’s truckers, drunks, or the occasional insomniac.
So when I saw him walk in at 3:17 AM exactly — tall, thin, wearing a perfectly pressed black suit — he stood out.

Not just because of the clothes, but because of how he moved.
Slow, deliberate steps, like he was measuring the distance between each one.

And the smile.
God, the smile.

It wasn’t friendly.
It wasn’t even forced.
It was… empty. Like he’d learned how to move his lips without letting the expression reach his eyes.

⸻

He sat down at the far end of the counter.
I went over, grabbed my pad.

“What can I get you?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if weighing the question.

Then, in the calmest, most even voice I’ve ever heard, he said:

“A cup of coffee. Please. Black. If it’s not too much trouble.”

The words were fine. The tone was fine. But there was something in the pause before “please” that made my skin prickle.

⸻

I poured him a cup.
He watched every movement, his eyes following my hands.

When I set it in front of him, he smiled again.

“You’ve been very kind. Not everyone is kind, you know. Some people are… careless.”

I mumbled something about “just doing my job.”
He didn’t look away.

⸻

The first weird thing happened when he took out his wallet.
He slid a twenty across the counter, even though the coffee was only $2.
But before I could grab it, he placed his hand over mine.

Cold.
So cold it made me flinch.

“I insist you keep the change. I’m told it’s polite to tip generously.”

I forced a smile and thanked him.
He just stared at me, like he was studying how my face moved.

⸻

He stayed for almost an hour.
Didn’t drink much of the coffee.
Didn’t check a phone.
Didn’t even glance around the diner.

He just watched me.
Not in a leering way — there was no lust or warmth in his expression.
It was more like he was waiting for something.

When he finally stood, he buttoned his jacket and said:

“You’re very pleasant. I hope we speak again.”

And then he left.

⸻

I thought that was it.
Just a creepy late-night customer I’d forget about in a week.

But the next night, at exactly 3:17 AM, he came back.
Same suit. Same seat. Same order.

⸻

This time, he asked questions.

Where did I live? Did I have a family? Was I in school?
Harmless enough on the surface, but the way he asked made it feel like a test.

Like if I gave the wrong answer, something bad would happen.

I lied about everything.
Told him I lived with roommates. That my parents were nearby. That I had a boyfriend who picked me up after work.

He nodded slowly, like he could see straight through me.

“It’s good to be… accounted for. People notice when you disappear.”

⸻

On the third night, he brought something.
A single red rose, wrapped in white tissue paper.

“For you. It’s polite to bring a gift.”

I didn’t want to touch it.
But refusing felt… dangerous.
So I took it, forced another thank-you, and stuck it in an empty glass behind the counter.

He smiled wider this time.
His teeth were perfectly straight. Perfectly white.
Like they’d never bitten into anything solid in his life.

⸻

After that, he came every night.
Always at 3:17.
Always polite.
Always watching.

It started getting under my skin.
I’d dream about him standing at the end of my bed, smiling that thin, empty smile.

And sometimes, I’d wake up convinced I’d heard his voice — soft, polite, whispering in the dark:

“May I come in?”

⸻

One night, I asked him why he always came so late.
His expression didn’t change.

“This is the hour when people are least… protected.”

I laughed nervously. “Protected from what?”

“From me.”

⸻

I told my boss about him.
She brushed it off — said some customers are just eccentric.

So I tried to ignore him.
Until the night I noticed his hands.

They weren’t the hands of a man who worked in an office.
The skin was pale, almost translucent.
The fingers long, too long, like they’d been stretched.

And under the nails — black. Not dirt. Something thicker. Dried.

⸻

A week later, one of the regulars — a trucker named Paul — went missing.
Last seen leaving the diner after his shift.

The police came by, asking questions.
Mr. Polite sat at the counter while they were there, sipping his coffee, smiling faintly.

When one of the officers asked if he’d seen anything suspicious, he said:

“Suspicion is impolite. But I hope you find your friend.”

And then he looked right at me.
The smile didn’t change.
But I swear I saw the tiniest flicker of amusement in his eyes.

⸻

Last night was the worst.

It was dead quiet.
No customers. No traffic outside.

At 3:17, the bell over the door didn’t ring.
But when I turned around, he was already sitting at the counter.

No footsteps. No sound. Just there.

He leaned forward.

“I believe it’s time we spoke somewhere more private.”

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that.
He tilted his head, as if I’d forgotten my manners.

“It would be impolite to refuse me.”

⸻

I’m writing this from the diner office.
He’s still out there.
Just sitting.
Smiling.

Every so often, he looks at the office door.
Not knocking.
Not calling out.
Just waiting.

I don’t think I’ll make it to sunrise.

Because the truth is, the longer I sit here, the more a part of me feels like it would be… rude to keep him waiting.

1mlwlxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mlwlxg/the_old_lady_next_door_might_have_drugged_my_cat/,The old lady next door might have drugged my cat.,"It's 3 in the morning and I can't sleep.

For the past hour or so I've been laying in bed trying to ignore the soft, frantic scrabbling of tiny claws with an occasional thump mixed in. These noises are a little easier to ignore than the muffled sobbing coming through the wall from the apartment next door. God, I hope that's not because of me.

Sweet Pea has never been the most energetic cat. She's usually curled up in front of the hall closet napping, when she isn't giving me judgmental stares from around a doorway. I don't know how such a small creature can be so haughty, somehow looking down a nose only four inches from the floor. She didn't even run around the place when we first moved in a couple of months ago. Something must have happened to her today, and I think I might know what it was.

Earlier today when I had just gotten home from work I found the door unlocked. Inside I found a diminutive older woman who appeared to be dressed as a rodeo clown's lawyer crouching down over Sweet Pea with a small plastic bag of handmade treats. I'm sure to most people something like that might be shocking, an event that joins the reliable old party stories like ""That Time The Waiter Spilled My Food And They Fired His Ass"" for decades to come, but for me it was just Tuesday. My landlord Ruth has a little issue with boundaries. 

She's the kind of woman who, in theory, in tiny doses, might be lovely to be around. She brings over trays of delicious homemade pastries and cookies that always seem to disappear faster than you think should be possible. She listens to you talk with eyes open wide, bulging behind her thick rhinestone rimmed glasses, heart open even wider.

But it was the third time this week I had come home to find her in my apartment. The third time this week a surprise social interaction was sprung on me when all I wanted to do was kick off my Customer Service Voice at the door and not think about how one day a robot will be able talk to people better than I do.

""Goddamnit Ruth, why are you here when I'm not?""

She jolted upright with a cry like an extinct bird's mating call, knocking the dinner table askew with her prodigious backside. Sweet Pea tore out of the kitchen like her ass was on fire, bringing down a tower of old pizza boxes in an uncontrolled demolition. Ruth sheepishly kicked a couple of pizza bones into a pile and swiped surprisingly steady hands down the front of her neon fuchsia pantsuit as she hit me with the full force of her $50,000 smile. The cacophonous rattling of her many plastic arm bangles was drowned out by her voice, as soft as a buzzsaw and twice as loud.

""Oh darling I thought I would just poke my head in and tidy up a tad, and then I couldn't just not say hello to Sweet Pea! Oh isn't she just a darling you know I had one just like her except he only had three legs, this was way back in, oh, yes I think it was-""

""You can't keep coming in here when I'm not home, Ruth.""

""Well why not? It's my gosh darn building! I'm here offering my services at no extra charge, to boot! I cook, I clean, I'm pretty nifty with a screwdriver and hammer, I can conversate with the best of 'em! Heck, just the other day-""

""It's against the law?""

""The law!"" She threw her head back and cackled deeply, lime green fingernails clutching at her midsection as she leaned back against the sink. ""You weren't so concerned with Johnny Law when you heard the price of the rent and my pet policy! I know you don't mean it anyhow, you know if you tell me to get out I'll just up and skedaddle! Come on now Jack, I'm just trying to make a connection. You like me, dont you, Jack? I just want to help my tenants, what's so gosh darn bad about that? Look, the sink is absolutely crawling with ants, this place could sure as heckfire use a woman's touch every now and then!""

I stormed over to the faucet and opened the hot water handle full blast, swiftly and decisively washing the horde of tiny, squirming bugs down the drain. Ruth was silent as I enacted my ant genocide and when I turned around afterwards she wore a strange expression I couldn't place on her pinched, leathery face. I thought I was being a bit harsh at the time, but sometimes you kind of have to be to get your damn alone time.

""There, no more ants. No more ants, no more Ruth. Get the fuck out. Please.""

If I had hurt her feelings she recovered quickly, once again blinding me with a smile far too big for her face. Getting hit with that at point blank is like realizing the light at the end of the tunnel is the reflection of your flashlight on a sleek metal cowcatcher bearing down on you.

""I can tell you're having a tough day darling so I'll get out of your hair, the last thing I want is you closing yourself off to me like some of the other tenants. I'll be back another time when you're ready to grab a bag and a broom! Please give Sweet Pea my love, and tell her she's the prettiest most-"" 

Sometimes you have to end her sentences for her so I cut her off there with a winning smile of my own, one forged through many years of serving the public. For maximum effect I squinted my eyes the same way she did. Most people subconsciously enjoy being mirrored, it makes them feel like they're not alone. 

""Okay thanks Ruth bye!"" I shouted as I shooed her away from the door and finally she began trundling her way to the elevator. Her thick, square heels portend her looming approach and I pictured the townspeople shuttering their shades in fear that she may darken their doorstep.

Before I could flee to the safety of my nest I turned around to see my neighbor from the other side of the apartment, Darla. Though she had a smirk on her mousey face and a bottle of whiskey in her hands I could also see that her little black tee shirt was inside out and her mascara was running.

""Hey Jagoff. I see you just survived Hurricane Ruth, wanna forget your troubles?"" 

She tilted her head and looked up at me with bright blue eyes that were swimming as her chipped nails played a beat on the glass bottle. I knew that turning her down would just have her crying and throwing things at the wall all night and I was so tired I almost did anyways. I figured with any luck, she would be passed out on the couch in twenty minutes and I could finally get to relaxing.

Today is just not my lucky day.

If she had any comments about the state of my apartment she mercifully kept them to herself, collapsing into the couch like a crumbling ruin as she eagerly unscrewed the bottle. We didn't talk much, thankfully, merely passing the bottle back and forth as we stared blankly at the flickering glow of the TV. Something was clearly bothering her but she didn't want to say, and I didn't want to ask. In a way, it was nice to let all of my thoughts slide out of my head like a cracked egg and just exist.

Eventually, the bottle ran dry. Then the unopened bottle of rum I had stashed in the back of the cabinet ran dry, too. I don't remember what we said as she stumbled out the door. As my hand fell from the knob and I turned around I thought I saw her keyring sitting on the coffee table.

In retrospect, perhaps the way I threw open the door was a bit dramatic, but whatever I had been planning to say was shocked out of me when I saw Darla was still standing there. I turned to look inside to restart my train of thought but the bare top of the table gave me nothing. In hindsight, I had probably been looking at a giant cockroach with my bleary eyes the first time. When I turned back to look at her my swimming mind once again struggled to convey anything. It's supposed to be my job to communicate with people, it was downright shameful.

Whatever I had been trying to communicate, she got a different signal. I won't bore you with the details, for my sake more than yours. The only pertinent ones are that it was unfortunately short, I'm a bit out of practice it seems, and that she was never out of my sight the whole time. Well, we both had our eyes closed for most of it, but you get what I mean. She was probably thinking of someone else, too.

When we were finished I made the worst mistake of all, I tried to be funny.

""Hey, try not to forget your keys this time.""

I think I was setting up some lame pun but I never got that far. She burst into tears and immediately started grabbing her clothes, turning her face away as I tried to explain.

""No, wait, I wasn't saying you should leave. I just-""

She cut me off with a harsh hand gesture, still facing away. Her reply came in a warbling, artificially cheery voice.

""No, no, I know that. I just suddenly remembered s-something and I have to go check on it right now.""

She sniffled loudly and pulled her clothes on with jerky motions, slowly making her way towards the door. Just before she walked out she turned and did her level best at a smile that looked like a chalk sidewalk drawing in a downpour.

""This was... um... nice. Maybe we can hang another time. Sorry I made it so weird.""

She was out the door before I could correct her, and it wasn't a full minute before I heard her softly crying through the wall.

It was getting pretty late by that point so I filled up Sweet Pea's bowl, only briefly stopping to note that she hadn't immediately come sauntering up to judge me through half-lidded eyes, and headed to bed. I should have probably checked her litter box but I was exhausted, and had a pretty good idea that Ruth had made it her first stop.

I haven't seen Sweet Pea all night since I caught Ruth feeding her homemade treats.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream echoes through the wall, followed by several impacts of smashing glass. I it up motionless in bed for long seconds, struggling to listen for any signs of life over the maddening scrabbling coming from my kitchen. My heart races a mile a minute as I slowly climb out of bed, taking a step towards the wall I shared with Darla. I almost jump clear out of my skin when a crashing sound rings out from my kitchen.

Sweet Pea must have knocked over a mug.

I cross the distance to the wall swiftly, leaving behind a string of mumbled curses I'd rather not repeat here. I press my ear to the wall to listen for signs of life from next door but that only seems to amplify the frantic scratching sounds, the wall somehow picking up the vibrations. Eventually I hear the sobbing pick up again and I breathe a sigh of relief. I'm not going to say she's okay, but at least she's alive over there.

The door to my bedroom makes a soft clicking noise when I turn the handle and the scratching sounds immediately stop. Swallowing hard I open the door and slowly step into the silent stillness. I had forgotten to turn the TV off and the input screen bathes the room in a cool blue, casting harsh shadows across discarded cardboard and half empty plastic bags. The room is as still as you always hope a grave will be.

The compressor in the AC kicks on and a small styrofoam cup clatters to the floor, making my eyes dart to the sink. On the floor below the tiny white cup lazily rolls back and forth in a small field of shiny ceramic shards. The air from the vent must have knocked over the styrofoam, but the mug?

Sweet Pea knows better than to run around on the counter.

I'm tempted to leave the mess for later but I know I'll be stepping in it when I make my morning coffee, plus it could be dangerous to the eight pound cat that lives in the bottom half-foot of my apartment.

I was walking past the sink to grab the broom when I heard the light creak of a stealthy step on a loose laminate floor tile. When I turn to look I see a dark shape dart out of view under the couch and instinctively take a step back, holding in a scream by biting my lip almost as deep as the shards of my favorite mug bite into my heel. The mess can wait, I need to get ahold of that goddamned cat before she gives me a heart attack.

I want to go pluck the broken chunks of ceramic in the bathroom but for some reason I can't bring myself to walk past the sofa.

""Sweet Pea? Come on girl, come out.""

I feel stupid calling to her like that, especially as the silence that answered hangs heavily in the air. She's as likely to come when I call as she is to climb up onto my lap, we just don't have that kind of relationship. I hoped that at least she would move or something, give me some indication that she was alive.

Anxiety digs it's long fingers deep into the back of my skull and squeezes my mind tight as I struggle to dismiss the dark thoughts hemming me in. She's just acting weird. Maybe she caught that roach I saw earlier and doesn't want to talk with her mouth full. Maybe the mug had landed on her head and she lay dying under the couch right now, grey sludge trickling down the sides of her tiny face as she watches what's supposed to be her caretaker tremble in fear and do nothing.

I take a deep breath in to calm my nerves, and almost immediately I can feel the grip of anxiety loosen. Being careful not to bump the shrapnel in my heel I slowly lower myself to the floor to peer underneath the couch. I should have turned on the light, it's pitch black under there and cluttered with old plastic wrappers and long lost socks. 

Jesus, I need to clean up a bit sometime. I know it's been getting bad, I know I have to clean it up at some point, but I just never seem to have the energy. Putting on the Fake Smile Voice all day to deal with entitled rich assholes is exhausting, by the time I get home I just want to sink into the sofa and forget about the day.

Crawling towards the couch on my hands and knees I think I see movement so I lean down and stick my arm under, turning my face away to reach further towards the back. As my fingers probe into dusty cobwebs and forgotten pieces of discarded food I think I hear a rustle and call out to her again.

""Getting real tired of this Pea."" 

She responds with a soft growling whine, somehow coming from in front of me. I turn my head and see her tense body crouched in the darkness under the coffee table. Did she sneak around behind me when I was bending down to reach under the couch?

Before I can react she thunders past my face like a wooly freight train, scattering trash and stray hairs like a smoke bomb. She streaks down the hall and around the corner, yowling and hissing the whole way. I hear her collide with a door as I shoot to my feet, ignoring the searing pain in my heel to sprint after her as the sounds of her own struggle intensify. I round the corner to the sound of a dull thud that precludes a heavy silence and come to a sudden halt.

The door to the hall closet is open.

I don't know how long I was standing there but the thought of Sweet Pea laying on the floor with a broken neck, an accusatory glare with vacant eyes, snaps me out of it and I step into the threshold. The closet looks just as I remember with one small difference. A small cardboard box has fallen off of the shelf and lay slanted in the corner. The side that was labelled is facing away but I don't need to see it to know which box it is. 

I don't even realize I've been slowly backing away until a shard of ceramic embedded in my heel makes contact with the baseboard in the hallway, sending a bright bolt of pain up my spine that snaps me out of my daze. I realize now that the perfect silence has been broken as a low growl emanates from just underneath me.

I can't begin to describe the relief I feel when I look down and see Sweet Pea hunched at my feet staring into the darkness of the hall closet. I swiftly close the closet door and bend down to pick her up, wincing as the pain in my leg begins to really make itself at home. Surprisingly she doesn't complain as I escort her to the bathroom for first aid.

I'm not a Vet but as far as I can tell she has no injuries, save for one small patch of fur missing on her flank. I assume that's from running into the closet door so hard it popped open. Her eyes are clear and alert, and she hasn't had any more episodes the whole time I was pulling shards of coffee cup out of my foot. My best guess is she had a reaction to something in the treat Ruth fed her earlier, God only knows what the hell it's made of, and it seems to have worn off. If I see any other strange behaviors tomorrow I'll get her looked at but for now I'm eager to put this night behind me. On the way out of the bathroom I pause at the hall closet and, without turning to look, gently turn the small lock on the handle.

Maybe Sweet Pea can sleep in my bedroom tonight, just this once.",1,1754764264.0,creepcast,3,1.0,False

I added some used coffee grounds last week and they seem to be taking off way more. Everything was grown from seeds outside 100% (I some how  killed all of plants i started indoors after giving them some miracle grow.) , aside from the pepper plant, I bought those. 8 romas, 1 Cherokee and either 1 cherry or grape tom plant, dont remember 
How should or could I improve this set up next year? 
Is there hope for this pepper plant to grow peppers this year?, I would also like to harden(?) Over the winter, that would just mean trimming it back to look like a ""Y"" and bringing it inside? 
I feel like it had more grapes last year. Everytime I cut it back it grows like 3x as much the next day, but not the fruit itself. 
I have an apple tree, lots of apples, not very big, but my concern is the amount of flys around the trees and that every apple looks like it has worm holes :(.

1mlwk6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1mlwk6e/does_the_blackdecker_cg800b_food_processor_and/,Does the Black+Decker CG800B Food Processor and Grinder Save Space Effectively?,"The BLACK+DECKER CG800B Spacemaker caught my eye with its dual functionality, blending the roles of a mini food processor and a coffee grinder. As someone perpetually low on counter space and always in search of kitchen gadgets that multitask, this product seemed like a dream come true. Over the past month, I've put it through its paces, prepping everything from fresh salsa to coarse coffee grounds. Spoiler alert: it does its jobs well, but it’s not without a few quirks.

**Sleek Design, Space-Saving Champions**  
This appliance’s under-cabinet mounting option was what sealed the deal for me. I don’t have the luxury of sprawling counter space in my tiny apartment kitchen, so having this tucked away yet always accessible was a game-changer. It takes some effort to install it securely under a cabinet, but once it’s in place, the setup is solid and saves a remarkable amount of room. The sleek black finish blends nicely with most modern kitchen aesthetics, and the compact design (measuring roughly 9.65 x 8.07 x 5.51 inches) means it doesn’t overpower the space.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
What surprised me about this device was its ability to handle multiple tasks without breaking down or overheating. BLACK+DECKER included two stainless-steel blades to accommodate its dual-purpose design: one for food processing and the other specifically calibrated for grinding coffee beans. The unit is driven by an AC adapter power source that provides consistent energy during use. For me, it made quick work of chopping onions and bell peppers for a fajita night, and it ground my medium roast coffee beans to a consistency perfect for my drip coffee maker.

[Find the best price for BLACK+DECKER CG800B on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b001tann7m/)

**Ease of Use and Cleaning Considerations**  
Switching between the food processor and coffee grinder modes is straightforward. The controls are minimal, with a simple pulse button that provides a tactile, responsive experience. Those who appreciate a clean kitchen will welcome the thoughtful inclusion of a removable storage lid for the containers. However, cleaning did pose a slight inconvenience. Despite being labeled hand-wash-friendly, navigating the nooks and crannies of the container edges required a bit of persistence. A quick soak and some patience did the trick.

**Pluses**  
- Space-efficient under-cabinet mount  
- Dual functionality for multitasking (food processing and coffee grinding!)  
- Reliable and sharp stainless-steel blades provide efficient prep work  
- Easy-to-use pulse button with consistent power

**Limitations**  
- Installation requires effort and proper tools, which could be tricky for less handy individuals  
- Cleaning certain spots around the lid and container edges can be tedious  
- Cannot handle larger food portions due to compact size  

**Competing Alternatives**  
While the BLACK+DECKER CG800B has been a solid performer, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum. One of its biggest competitors is the Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus. That model delivers similar compact food processing functionality but doesn't double as a coffee grinder. On the flip side, its containers and components are dishwasher-safe, making cleanup far more convenient. Another noteworthy contender is the Hamilton Beach Food Chopper 70740. It may lack the added coffee grinder feature, but it makes up for it with a slightly higher capacity and a simpler setup process. 

For those prioritizing the under-cabinet mounting option, though, the BLACK+DECKER holds a distinct edge among its peers. It also stays cool and quiet in operation, a stark contrast to some competitors that operate at a volume similar to a rock concert.

**Cost Efficiency**  
From a value-for-money perspective, the BLACK+DECKER CG800B justifies its price tag by offering two appliances in one compact package. Its sturdy construction and reliable performance are assets that are hard to ignore. While the upfront cost might feel a little steep compared to standalone coffee grinders or mini food processors, the long-term utility of having both functions in one device balances it out. You’re essentially investing in a device that saves both counter space and the hassle of juggling multiple gadgets.

The driver parked in the middle of the road in Bourj Hammoud to wait for a newelne coffee for a solid 5 minutes and the whole way he was not going over 15 km/h despite roads being clear (not an exaggeration as there is a screen at the front that shows the speed). Oh, and by the time I got off he had gone through at least 4 cigarettes. 

Also, on Thursday on the way back to Dawra in the afternoon, the driver told me to get off the bus at Galerie Semaan and wait for the next one as I was the only passenger and he wasn't gonna go to Dawra for me. Ended up taking bus number 22 and it went pretty smoothly.

I know right off the bat that sounds really weird. but I met him at a really weird transitional time in my life, I was going through a lot of spiritual changes and he gave me a ton of guidance. He became an unofficial mentor to me for a few years and during a difficult time. For almost a year we were meeting every week for coffee. He helped me a LOT. As I started to feel stronger mentally and emotionally, I began to feel triggered by him, couldn’t explain but I just felt like distancing. I’ve allowed the friendship to keep going since then, partly out of guilt and partly because there were instances where I needed support in my life.

Now I just really have no interest anymore. I don’t even feel we really connect. When I’m not soliciting advice, there’s literally nothing to talk about and it’s draining to spend time with him. But he still reaches out every few weeks suggesting to go for coffee.

What I really want to do is just ghost him. I don’t want to tell him anything. I want to walk away. He’s only ever been kind to me but somehow I feel like he’s just connecting with me through his own ego/ideas of me, like he doesn’t perceive my apathy or disengagement.

1mlwi9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mlwi9m/find_out_if_the_chulux_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Find Out If the CHULUX Single Serve Coffee Maker is Worth It,"The CHULUX CL-KM807-W has become a staple in my life, and I say that as someone who needs coffee like oxygen to fuel my mornings. This single-serve coffee maker is compact, lightweight, and surprisingly versatile for such a small machine. I’ve got it sitting on my kitchen counter, squeezed between my toaster and spice rack, and thanks to its slim 4-inch-wide design, it fits perfectly without demanding too much counter space. This is one of those appliances you don’t have to rearrange your entire kitchen for, and I appreciate that.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Flexibility**  
Using this coffee machine feels like second nature. It’s a simple one-button operation, which means there’s no steep learning curve. I’ve tested it with K-pods, including both 1.0 and 2.0 capsule versions, and it didn’t miss a beat. The option to use a reusable filter for coffee grounds was a game-changer since it let me enjoy my locally roasted blends without sacrificing convenience. Plus, the ability to brew between 6 to 12 ounces made it easy to customize my coffee depending on how desperate I was for caffeine that particular day.  

[Compare CHULUX CL-KM807-W prices on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)  

**Rapid Brewing and Auto Shut-Off**  
Mornings in my house are chaotic, so speed is essential, and this coffee maker doesn’t disappoint. It consistently heated and brewed coffee to 190°F in just under two minutes. That’s faster than it takes for my dog to get bored waiting for breakfast. The auto shut-off feature adds an extra layer of convenience; I could brew my cup, rush out the door, and not worry about whether I left the machine on. A lifesaver for my always-on-the-go lifestyle.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
The small footprint is probably my favorite part about this coffee maker. Apartments, office desks, RVs, or even dorm rooms could benefit from its minimalist design. I’ve used it in my kitchen, but honestly, I’d trust it to perform just as well on a work desk without getting in the way. Its design, which accommodates travel mugs up to 7.3 inches tall, also meant my morning routine didn’t have to include extra transfers to a thermos. The removable drip tray is another thoughtful touch, making cleanup and size adjustments effortless.

**Positives**  
- Ergonomic one-button operation minimizes complexity.  
- Supports travel mugs up to 7.3 inches tall and collects excess spills efficiently.  
- Fast brewing time heats to an ideal 190°F in under two minutes.  
- Energy-saving auto shut-off feature enhances convenience.  
- Customizable brew sizes from 6 to 12 oz cater to personal preferences.  

**Critiques**  
While there’s a lot to love about this coffee maker, there were a couple of quirks worth mentioning:  
- It’s unavailable for altitudes above 4,000 feet, which feels limiting for geographically high locations.  
- Water quality can affect performance, requiring regular descaling every 1-2 months to avoid clogging.  
- It doesn’t include a reusable coffee filter, which has to be purchased separately.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking this coffee maker up against similarly compact single-serve models like the Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew produced some interesting results. The CHULUX excels in speed, as its rapid brew time edges out the competition slightly. It shares compactness with the Keurig K-Mini, but at nearly half the weight, it’s easier to move around or pack for travel. However, I found the FlexBrew to be more versatile because it can handle ground coffee without requiring an additional purchase of a reusable filter. That said, the CHULUX still holds its own in delivering no-frills functionality while being far more budget-friendly than either competitor.

**Quality for Price**  
Let’s talk about value because this machine occupies a sweet spot between affordability and performance. By design, it’s a no-nonsense appliance that delivers reliable results at a price point that won’t have you wincing at your credit card statement. Is it perfect? No. But the customization options, compact size, and simplicity it offers make it feel worth every dollar, particularly for those who live in smaller spaces or have minimal brewing needs.

1mlwhyh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlwhyh,1 of 80–200 ever built in this configuration: FIAT 1500S OSCA Coupé,"Thought I’d share my latest Italian classic – a Fiat 1500S OSCA Coupé. Depending on which source you believe, they only built somewhere between 80 and 200 of these, so it’s really not something you bump into often.

I actually bought it from the same guy I got my Fiat 124 Spider from. He took amazing care of it – no rust anywhere, still wearing its original paint, and the only thing that’s been refreshed are the seat covers. Otherwise, it’s as it left the factory.

The Coupé version actually started life as the 1500S Cabriolet. To make the Coupé, Fiat and Pininfarina would take a convertible body, remove the soft top, trunk lid, and windshield, and replace them with fixed-roof components and new rear panels. The result is that long, elegant roofline and balanced proportions — a silhouette not unlike the Ferrari 250 GTE of the same era.

The best part is what’s under the hood: a twin-cam inline-four designed by the Maserati brothers (Fratelli Maserati). After they sold Maserati, they started OSCA (Officine Specializzate Costruzioni Automobili) and kept making jewel-like race engines. The 1500S motor is basically a toned-down version of their 1500cc race unit – still loves to rev and has that mechanical feel you just don’t get anymore.

In the late ’50s and early ’60s, Fiat teamed up with OSCA to inject some racing pedigree into their lineup. Fiat provided the platform, OSCA brought the engine magic, and the result was a few small-batch cars like this one. The 1500S Coupé got Pininfarina styling, grand tourer comfort, and a genuine competition heart.

Driving it is pure 1960s charm – light steering, smooth gearbox, and an engine note that makes you grin every time you push it. With production numbers this tiny, it feels like I’m taking a piece of history out every time I turn the key.

⸻

Fun facts:
	•	OSCA was founded by three Maserati brothers after leaving Maserati in 1947.
	•	The engine design in the 1500S comes straight from their racing program.
	•	Fiat built far fewer 1500S OSCAs than even the rarer Ferraris of the era.
	•	“S” in 1500S stood for “Speciale” – and they meant it.
	•	Mine still wears its original paint from the factory — 60+ years later.",23,1754763979.0,classiccars,1,0.86,False

One that caught my attention? Fast food.

It got me thinking: *What’s the going rate for a large drink or a Big Mac value meal at McDonald’s where you live?*

In some states, you can still grab a large drink for a buck. In others, you’re paying closer to $2.50 for the same cup of soda. And the Big Mac meal? I’ve seen people post receipts showing $7.99 in one city and over $12 in another. Same burger, same fries, wildly different totals.

I’m not here to rant about inflation or corporate pricing strategies — I’m genuinely curious.

* Is your local McDonald’s sticking to budget-friendly pricing?
* Or has the Big Mac become a “treat yourself” kind of splurge?

Drop your local prices in the comments. Bonus points if you share the city and state or copy of receipt so we can see how much it varies across the country. I’m wondering if there’s a clear “most expensive” and “least expensive” state for McDonald’s runs in 2025.

I have a light couch, similarly coloured coffee table, and black desk. I will be redoing floors long term (linoleum pink). This room multifunctions as TV/game room and office (and spare bed if needed). 

The walls are yellow sheets of wood panels with a bump-out seam that doesn’t go all the way up, and then sheets of light wood panel on the outside wall. Fireplace with DIY yellow-painted bookshelves on each side. Yellow wall above fireplace looks textured somehow, like sideways rounded popcorn bumps. 

Colour scheme so far consists of the couch, black desk, and I’m hoping for emerald green accent colours. Still need to redo curtains, floors, lights, get a carpet, etc. Nothing has been “designed” yet. 

Would you leave as is and paint over the yellow? Removing the light wood panels seems like it’d be a mess and a lot of work. Alternatively, I was considering painting over the yellow and adding something like the Artika wood soundproofing panels around the TV area, maybe going over the fireplace but it may look weird next to the light wood. 

What colour/range of colours would be my best bet? Stick with lighter colours? Do something darker than the couch? White/greys, or maybe a lighter shade of green?

Hey folks,

I’m the founder of Bangalore Newbies, a community I started in Oct 2023 that’s now done 400–500 events. 

Over the past year, I’ve met so many people who just wanted a place to hang out, make friends, and have fun without all the awkward networking vibes or swipe culture. I want to help create a space that’s accessible and welcoming to everyone. Somewhere we can make friends as adults without the pressure of always having to be our best. 

So… we’re starting Make it Real.

We’re building a webapp for it, but that’ll take a bit more time. I thought, Why wait? 

We’re starting right now.

What’s the idea?

A third space in Bangalore where you can meet people, try cool activities, and actually enjoy being present.

What sets us apart?

	•	No cameras, no phones during events
	•	Small groups so conversations actually happen
	•	Safe, welcoming spaces with people who just want to connect
	•	Budget-friendly but interesting experiences

What’s coming up this month?

Here are some of the events we’ve put together for you.

	•	Make your own Ganapati workshop
	•	Paint and brunch
	•	Exclusive jam session
	•	Food walk and restaurant takeover
	•	Dave and Buster’s night
	•	Heritage walk
	•	Curated matcha and coffee experience
	•	Exclusive improv session

Pricing:

A ₹300 one-time access fee, redeemable against your first event. After that, you just pay for the events you attend. We’re keeping it transparent and affordable.

If you’ve been wanting to meet new people in the city without the usual pressure, this is for you. Comment or DM me to join, we keep events small, so spots go fast.

TL;DR: We’re launching Make it Real, a no-camera, no-phone, safe third space in Bangalore to meet new people and try fun activities. ₹300 one-time fee (redeemable), then pay per event. We have exciting plans for just this month. ",0,1754763767.0,BangaloreMeetups,1,0.4,False

1mlwdsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1mlwdsr/evaluate_the_best_programmable_coffeemaker/,Evaluate the best programmable coffeemaker Cuisinart DCC-1500TG,"Testing out the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG has been an unexpectedly delightful experience. At first glance, its sleek and modern aesthetic drew me in—it has this black finish that fits right in with most kitchen decors, whether minimalist or bold. Unlike bulky coffee makers that take up unnecessary space, this one’s dimensions are surprisingly compact despite packing a 12-cup carafe. I couldn’t resist placing it next to my toaster, where it effortlessly elevated my counter’s vibe. But hey, it’s not just about looks. I was genuinely curious whether this chic drip coffee maker could deliver on its promises.

**Programmability at Its Finest**

What instantly caught my attention was the programmable functionality. With my erratic morning schedule, being able to set this machine 24 hours in advance is a game changer. I remember setting it before heading to bed, only to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the house. It almost felt like magic. The LCD clock is intuitive, and programming it didn’t send me into frustration mode, which is more than I can say for other coffee makers I’ve tried. Bonus points for that one.

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1500TG price on Amazon.](https://kepmad.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)

**Brew Pause and Warmth Retention**

One standout feature that really saved the day was the Brew Pause. Imagine you’re half-asleep and can’t wait for the entire pot to brew—problem solved. I poured a quick cup mid-brew, and no spills or messes accompanied my impatience. The warming plate is also adjustable, keeping the coffee at just the right temperature for up to two hours. I tested this while working from home, and, even after an hour, the coffee still felt warm and inviting. No need to keep reheating. Automatic shutoff after the warming cycle ends is another thoughtful touch, especially for someone forgetful like me.

**Filtration for Better Tasting Coffee**

This machine combines the function of a permanent nylon coffee filter with a charcoal water filter, and that’s where things get interesting. I brewed the same ground coffee I always use, but it somehow tasted fresher. Maybe it’s placebo, or perhaps the filtration really does work wonders. Either way, it felt nice knowing I wasn’t constantly buying disposable filters. Sustainability and good taste? I’ll take it.

**Advantages**

- Eye-catching, compact design that fits most kitchen setups  
- Programmable settings simplify morning routines  
- Includes reusable and eco-friendly coffee filter options  
- Brew Pause feature prevents impatience-induced disasters  

**Noise and Build Quality Concerns**

However, not everything about the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG made me jump with joy. Let’s address the elephant—or, should I say, the growling bear—in the room. As the machine works its magic, it emits a noticeable gurgling noise that I didn’t expect. While it’s not deafening, it could be distracting if you’re someone who enjoys peaceful mornings. Additionally, the carafe design, while ergonomic, feels slightly thin. I don’t have butter fingers, but I’d be cautious when handling it.

**Weaknesses**

- Louder than anticipated during the brewing process  
- The carafe glass feels more fragile than ideal  

**Competitive Options**

When I compared this unit with other coffee makers I’ve tested, a few similar models came to mind. For instance, the Breville Precision Brewer boasts similar programmability but feels bulkier and costs significantly more. On the flip side, something like the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker offers a quieter operation but lacks the same refinement in coffee taste due to its simpler filtration system. In clarity, brew quality, and design, the Cuisinart seems to find a middle ground that’s hard to beat within its price range.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of price-to-quality ratio, this coffee maker sits comfortably where value meets functionality. It’s not an entry-level machine, so don’t expect bargain-basement pricing; however, considering the inclusion of programmable settings, high-quality filtration, and other thoughtful features, I found the investment reasonable. Buying it felt more like securing a long-term kitchen companion than just ticking off a purchase from my list.

1mlwcxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1mlwcxq/tifu_by_getting_into_the_most_confusing_hot_and/,"TIFU by getting into the most confusing, hot and cold relationship of my life with a girl who kept me at arm’s length but still called me her boyfriend?","She gave me a chocolate and hours later ""isn't it better to part ways?""
So, from the moment I met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. Some time later, we had a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, saying her hair was messy. Eventually, she told me she had autism.

Our conversations were often one sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She once told me I was treating her differently after knowing she was autistic. She shared that her ex had abandoned her, and that she’d been seeing another guy who left her for someone else.

One day, I got mugged and almost lost her number. Strangely, she didn’t seem to care much and even said she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She told me about her cats and how her nephews also had autism. She once got very mad when her cousin mentioned she drank with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she said we never went out. At first, she refused out of embarrassment, but after I insisted, she agreed then the next day she asked if we should just be friends. We ended up going anyway, bought snacks, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon being romantic. She never let me see her phone and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. There, she said she was embarrassed and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine, but she quickly got reactive and her mood changed. Another day, after some flirting at the park, I walked her home, but she made it clear she didn’t want me meeting her family.

There was a day her sister drove her to my place, and I joked that we didn’t go out much because she was always making excuses. She got really mad. Another time, we played a game together, I criticized it, and she got upset and stopped playing. She gave me chocolate, we hung out, and then she suddenly suggested breaking up.

She invited me to a party with her, but kept changing her mind about whether I should go. I asked if she didn’t want me there. Eventually, I decided to show up earlier than she told me to, and her sister saw me and took me inside. We ended up at her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then, out of nowhere, she said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?”

After that, we went to her place, she wanted me to stay the night, but I went home. With all these ups and downs, I finally called her and ended things. She cried and blocked me. Later, she said I’d sent her to therapy (CAPS) and ruined her happiness. Soon after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she expected, and we started talking again.

While chatting, I found her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend’s ex. I got upset, but later told her I loved her. She said she wished I had been somewhere she went recently. Then she called, inviting me to her mom’s birthday. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then invited me over for coffee.

We spoke again, but she told me her dad was mad at me. I got upset and vented online. She found out and accused me of using and deceiving her, saying she only acted that way because she was insecure and autistic, that she prayed for me every day… and then she blocked me for good.


TL;DR:
Got into a rollercoaster relationship with a girl who said she had autism, constantly sent mixed signals, blocked and unblocked me multiple times, refused to introduce me to her family (then suddenly did), suggested we find “a hot girl” for me, accused me of ruining her happiness, and finally vanished after blaming everything on insecurity and autism.

***GAME INFORMATION***

***THE SETTING:*** For whatever reason, your character is interested in new work—whether they were recently laid off, just starting out, or are looking to transition into a new field, they inevitably stumble upon the job posting above and find it intriguing enough to apply within. If clever enough, the decoded cipher will provide your character with an email which they may provide their application materials.  
  
The game is set in modern day London. The world you exist in is split between common normalcy separated by a supernatural veil which harbors an otherwise hidden world ruled by fringe science and cosmic phenomena. In the ""normal"" world, fantastical criminal networks, super-villains, and the heroes and geniuses which attempt to keep them in check, rule over a crumbling society; behind the veil, a wavering line of psychic impossibility, unexplained events, and mysterious creatures threaten to tow the line between ""*hidden""* and ""*here"".*

***YOUR CHARACTER:*** Incredibly skilled, intelligent, desperate, has little to loose.  
  
***YOU ARE...:***

* Someone who is interested in a high-stakes, emotional game including violent themes and explicit content.
* Someone who is willing to delve deeply into their character creation and psyche.
* Someone who is interested in forming a community and friend group outside of in-character interactions.
* Someone who is an experienced writer, willing to match post length and quality, and post at least once daily (*previous MOTW experience not required*).
* Someone who thinks that out of character connections are just as important as in character connections.
* You are over 18 years old, preferably over 21.
* An ally or member of the LGBT+ community.

***THE DM/THE PLAYERS:*** My name is Lo! I am a DM (30, he/him) who has been playing TTRPG's for a little under a decade and writing for roughly two. This game is entirely home-brewed and, as it features my most favorite original character, is very dear to my heart. I am a lover of prose, and a hobby novelist who enjoys writing mostly dark themes or things that could be considered cosmic horror or psychological thrillers.   
As a Graduate student with a full-time job, my normal every-day-life is very busy, and I carve out particular times during the week and weekend to dedicate toward writing and my games because it is truly my favorite way to interact socially. I love yapping about characters and plot theory with fellow players, sending memes or just hanging out in voice chat. I would hope that anyone who applies to this game would enjoy those things as well!

I posted last night and deleted it right away because I was having glutinous food addiction struggles and right after I posted I felt like an idiot so I took ot down. I didn't cave tho, despite wanting to go crazy in the kitchen. But I love to eat, and the older I get the more I'm realizing how unhealthy I am, and that needs to change. I managed to make it through, with my trusty Nalgene by my side. The only thing I had besides lots of water was a couple of cups of black coffee during the whole thing. 

I just came back from the store. I bought some sliced melon cups, and I really thought I would down the whole thing, but after a few peices, I was full. Mind blown! Put the cup back in the fridge for later. For dinner tonight I bought a salmon fillet, and I'm going to steam some veggies, and I can't wait to get cooking.

Couple of observations about the process. One, the heartburn was awful, starting on day two, and I definitely stayed properly hydrated. I tried the baking soda in water remedy and that unfortunately did nothing, and I thought it was so disgusting I almost threw it up. I have seen posts of people saying they go on week long fasts and it doesn't hit them until the end. No way I could make it that long without some kind of supplement, which defeats the purpose. But if I do another one of these, it'll be managable for the 72 hours I guess.

I started out day two feeling like Superman. But my engery really waned at the end of day two and into day three. Like crazy weakness. I kept thinking about the show Alone and if I were on it, I would have tapped by now from sheer inability to keep moving. And I'm a fairly active guy. I also got headaches and that is starting to go away now. I slept a full 8 hours both nights so I know it was the fasting affecting me.

Otherwise I think I did fine. But I really came to terms with my eating habits. It became very apparent to me that my hunger was not driven by survival needs, but the fact that I am just addicted to bad eating habits. I'm glad I did this, I learned some things about myself. I'm hoping as I come out of the fast I'll go forward with healthy eating habits and won't fall back into that.

1mlwajw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1mlwajw/looking_for_onthego_cans/,Looking for on-the-go cans,"Hey all, just found this sub. I'm a web developer and a musician. Over the last year, I've found I really enjoy working at coffee shops or coworking spaces more than at my home office that I've had for almost a decade. Change of pace and all that.

## What I use/have used:

* I use a pair of AirPods Pros 2's with Comply foam tips every night (I sleep with them in), as well as on-the-go as my main set of in-ears. They're small and compact, sound great, have great battery life, and work flawlessly with my ecosystem (all Apple devices). I won't be the first to admit they aren't super well balanced for things like mixing or mastering, but their ANC and transparency modes make them great for every day usage. I feel that, sometimes, they sound a little muffled compared to other high-end speakers and headphones.
* When I'm working at things at my desk, I'm typically listening on a set of KRK Rokit 7 Gen4's (monitors, not headphones). They aren't the best monitors but they sound great and balanced in my space. If I'm wanting headphones, I'm usually using a set of DT770's - they sound amazing for a fairly flat-response sound, but with the mile of fixed cable, large size, and frequency response, they're difficult to transport in a smaller bag, not reasonable to whip out in a constrained coffee shop, and not as ""fun"" to listen to on the go.
* I have a pair of $150 Audio Technica ATH-E40's (IEMs) that I've used for performance. I acknowledge they are budget compared to the IEM world, but they sound decent, though I feel they're a little mid-scooped, and they get uncomfortable after a while.
* I had a Steelseries Arctis 3. They were... fine. Not super clear and quite unbalanced, with one ear always a little louder than the other. I gave them away.
* I also had a pair of Genki Waveforms (earbuds). These were, quite possibly, the worst headphones I've ever had the displeasure to use. Unbalanced, bad app, firmware never updated, super uncomfortable, lack of customization for the most basic of options, and confusing UX. I honestly just threw these in the trash.
* I also had a pair of Shure IEMs (I don't remember what model - they were a $100 set about 15 years ago). They were fine but nothing special.

## Ideally, here's what I'm looking for:

* Closed-back over-ears. I could be talked into open-backs since I don't have any open-backs, but, for public spaces, closed-backs are probably better.
* Compact size. Yeah, they're over-ears - I get that - but the ability to fold them up would be nice. I had some Beats over-ears at one point (back when they weren't Apple) that sounded horrible, but they folded up nicely and fit in my bag.
* Comfort. I'd like to use them for 2-3 hours at a time without feeling like my skull is being squeezed.
* Jack to change out the cable - both from a length perspective, and from a maintainability perspective.
* Wired is great, but Bluetooth would be great on the go. Bonus points for having both options, and bonus points for having multiple radios to switch devices easily (i.e. between iPhone, MacBook Pro, and maybe Nintendo Switch) without having to repair every time.
* Build quality. I don't need to have over-engineered, audiophile components, but I don't want something that feels like it's gonna get crushed in my bag without a case.
* Aesthetics. This is, unfortunately, one I can't describe well. I've seen some that have a ""vintage"" look with exposed coils that may appeal to audiophiles, but it doesn't appeal to me. I also like chunky bands with lots of support, so the Sony WH-1000XM5's (I know, they're a popular choice) don't appeal to me either.
* Ability to use them at the gym, so some sweat-resistance would be a nice touch.

## What I don't care about:

* ANC. In most situations, I do *not* want ANC - I want to hear a bit of the outside world around me.
* Clunky mobile or desktop apps. We've all used these apps that look like a multi-million dollar company paid $50 to an overseas developer to put together the buggiest, most non-intuitive app ever. Just give me something that works when I need it, and disappears when I don't.
* Microphones. I do not care about having a mic.

## What I'll be using them with:

As mentioned somewhere above, MacBook Pro, iPhone, and possibly a Nintendo Switch.

## Tonal balance:

I've got studio monitors and DT770's that cover the flatter end of the spectrum. I want something that sounds full and dynamic - something that makes you go ""wow, these sound **GREAT**!"" Clear and sparkly highs without being shrill, a full, impactful, and articulate low end that rumbles when necessary, and mids that don't sound honky.

I listen to almost everything - my current playlist includes some piano jazz (E.S.T.), post rock (Caspian, Shy Low, Sadness), math rock (TTNG, Delta Sleep), ambient (Six Missing, Lunar Sound + Circuit), prog rock and metal (Animals as Leaders, Dream Theater), some pop (Phoenix), some downtempo electronica (similar to ""beats to code to"" stuff on Youtube), and some hip-hop (Kendrick, Ludacris). I'd argue that I don't listen to hip-hop/rap/r&b as much as the rest.

I tend to like a ""Dance"" EQ preset that boosts lower mids (around 100-200hz) and highs (1k-8k).

## Budget:

I'm kind of open. I'm not looking to buy anything today, but would like something soon. $300-400 would be ideal, but I would prefer to go lower if possible. I would be open to spending more and waiting a bit if I could find something that fits my needs better.

I'm not going to give real names in this so a name in this isn't the real name of the person in this story. Also I can't remember everyone's age but think early-mid 20s for everyone. 

This happened a few years ago but I've been told it's pretty ridiculous.

I had moved to a city an hour away from my family, moving in with some friends. At first it was a small apartment where I slept on the couch. 

My best friend and a friend we made living out there talked about moving out. Our new friends parents offered to buy and renovate a house that we could live in.

After about 4 months we had a house with an extra room, new kitchen, paint and flooring. Everyone moving in was me, my best friend (Eddy), our new friend (Alex), her boyfriend (Devin) and her sister (Belle). We all got into a good routine until Eddy moved in with his boyfriend.

We all got together to look for a new roommate, communicating with each other about who we all agreed on and gained another friend who moved here for school.

After his school year was over, he moved out and Devin's cousin (Travis) and his girlfriend (Macy) were being evicted. We'd built another whole room for them because the one that was open was too small for 2 people.

We all got a long, got a routine and I thought we were all getting along. I was able to quit my job as Ross because Alex and Belle's Dad had a business they needed help with. The three of us started going to a trainer 2 times a week and worked together really well. I was at a point in my life where I felt really good and happy for the first time in a very long time.

As Life does, things happened where they couldn't afford to keep me and I had to start looking for another job. I never applied to so many places in one day before but I found one within a week that would've paid me more than I was making with them.

I don't know if this happens to everyone but I always get anxious on my first day of work, even on the first day of school. Macy noticed and asked if I was okay and I replied, 'I always feel sick and anxious on my first day of work.' What I got was, 'can you just go away?' with a look on her face that I just spit in her coffee. I walked into the bathroom to calm down because that had set me off in a different and then went to work.

My new co workers praised me for how fast I learned and putting in so much effort, saying that I was good enough to be in a higher position. I got home that day, cooked and cleaned up dinner for Alex and Belle to sit me down to have a serious conversation.

Basically they were given an ultimatum where I was asked to leave or other people would move out. Because Devin and Travis are so close he didn't care if I was gone so I was the one kicked out.

I should've asked why and what I did to deserve this, but I felt so betrayed that I knew I would say things I'd regret if I even opened my mouth. I just nodded, went to my room for however long it was my room and called my Mom crying.

I was kicked out Wednesday night and was gone before noon on Friday. Eddy helped me pack all day Thursday and got angry all day on my behalf. He was the only one to help me pack up all my things and tell me how sorry he was when I know he would've been on my side if he still lived there.

The next weekend after moving back in with my Mom, Eddy and I went on one of our favorite hikes and he told me everything.

When I said I felt sick and anxious when Macy asked if I was okay, she never told me she had trigger words and I'd said one of them. I guess that set her off and she called out to work. She worked for an eyeglasses store and gave her a 90 day probation where she couldn't call out last minute more than 3 times. That day was the 3rd time and they fired her.

Instead of taking responsibility for her own actions (like I did going to work while feeling like my stomach wanted to evacuate) she blamed me and said if I wasn't kicked out, her and Travis would move out. Now neither of them had a job while I was an adult and went to work after being laid off the week before. 

The cherry on top, they were all talking mad shit on me at Devin's Mom's garage sale that I was supposed to be helping with if I hadn't been kicked out and she is the one who put them in their place. Eddy's now fiance said he had to leave for a bit or he'd start a brawl in my honor😂

I know it was literally nothing I did for this to happen, it was just a petty little girl throwing a fit because she can't communicate like an adult. I don't usually say this, but they are the only ones I hope has a Karma Credit; having their Karma build up until they feel like their lives fall apart all at once like they did to me.

I don't usually hold a grudge, but I have 2 that I'll hold onto for the rest of my life; this and the girl who trashed my room in Eddy's house in our hometown and stole sentimental things from me.

I always treat people how I want to be treated even when they don't deserve it. I haven't seen or spoken to any of them but Eddy since the day I moved out. Alex and I tried but I knew Devin was more important to her anyway. She met both of us at basically the same time. Now they're married with a little man and in a weird way, I'm happy for her just not for him🤷‍♀️

I think what hurt me more was feeling like I was a stable and responsible adult with good friends, just for all of that to be taken in an instant. That I was expendable and forgettable to people who left a lasting impact on my life.

I guess instead of feeling like a broken record every time it gets brought up, I'd post here and send this link to anyone who asks. Also because I think it's not something that happens to everyone.",0,1754763415.0,badroommates,2,0.5,False

Guyss, I’m (M21) telling you this because my mf friends aren’t trusting me and just roasting me 😭

So I'm an intern for a couple of months now. Day before yesterday, I’m at my desk, working, when our team leader (27–28F) walks in with a new girl (22–23F, solid 8–9/10). She introduces her as new member of our team.

Leader explains her stuff and leaves. The new girl sits right next to me in the leader’s chair. She was occassionally glancing at me, but I’m too shy to look back. Suddenly she smiles and says, “Hi.” We exchange intros.

After lunch, she’s back in the same seat, saying the leader told her to sit there for a while. She’s staring at me , like those “creep” posts, but reversed 😂
Out of nowhere:
“Hey… I wanna say something.”
Me: “I said kaho.”
Her: “You look so cute.”

I’m shocked😶‍🌫️. No random girl has ever said that to me.🥲 I ask, “Sorry?” and she repeats it:
“You look so cute. I was trying to say this since lunch break.”

I awkwardly say thanks😭🙏🏻, and that’s it. Told my friends they roasted me and said I’m making it up.

Plot twist:
After work, I tell my team leader over coffee.( We have good connection) She laughs and says, “See? I told you it’s real.”

Next day? The new girl is gone. Leader kicked her out of our team for some unknown reason 😭 bro wth?

Let's see what happens next.

# THE FINAL PUPIL

***GAME INFORMATION***

***THE SETTING:*** For whatever reason, your character is interested in new work—whether they were recently laid off, just starting out, or are looking to transition into a new field, they inevitably stumble upon the job posting above and find it intriguing enough to apply within. If clever enough, the decoded cipher will provide your character with an email which they may provide their application materials.  
  
The game is set in modern day London. The world you exist in is split between common normalcy separated by a supernatural veil which harbors an otherwise hidden world ruled by fringe science and cosmic phenomena. In the ""normal"" world, fantastical criminal networks, super-villains, and the heroes and geniuses which attempt to keep them in check, rule over a crumbling society; behind the veil, a wavering line of psychic impossibility, unexplained events, and mysterious creatures threaten to tow the line between ""*hidden""* and ""*here"".*

***YOU ARE...:***

* Someone who is interested in a high-stakes, emotional game including violent themes and explicit content.
* Someone who is willing to delve deeply into their character creation and psyche.
* Someone who is interested in forming a community and friend group outside of in-character interactions.

***THE DM/THE PLAYERS:*** My name is Lo! I am a DM (30, he/him) who has been playing TTRPG's for a little under a decade and writing for roughly two. This game is entirely home-brewed and, as it features my most favorite original character, is very dear to my heart. I am a lover of prose, and a hobby novelist who enjoys writing mostly dark themes or things that could be considered cosmic horror or psychological thrillers.   
As a Graduate student with a full-time job, my normal every-day-life is very busy, and I carve out particular times during the week and weekend to dedicate toward writing and my games because it is truly my favorite way to interact socially. I love yapping about characters and plot theory with fellow players, sending memes or just hanging out in voice chat. I would hope that anyone who applies to this game would enjoy those things as well!  
  
There are already two players who have entered the game, both of which are experienced in writing and TTRPG's and share similar sentiments surrounding character creation and out of character involvement.

1mlw9cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mlw9cj/do_i_send_the_hey_girly_text/,"Do I Send The ""Hey Girly"" Text?","First-time writer, throw away because I know a lot of my ex co-workers are avid redditors. 

I (20M) left my job at a local coffee shop chain about a month ago. My time there was miserable, to say the least, but there were enough good parts that I stuck with it for a few years. One of these good parts was the people. I made lots of friends and really enjoyed getting along with everyone I worked with. 

Well, almost everyone. Earlier this year, our shop promoted a new assistant manager (20M). I'll call him Joel, and Joel has a wife named Laura (20F). Laura is lovely, she visits him all the time at work, remembers all of our names, brings treats and gifts for holidays, and is overall just a very warm person. The other character of this story is Rose (22F). Rose is also married, though her husband (27M) isn't around nearly as much as Laura is, if at all. 

Onto the problem. As I mentioned previously, I left my job about a month ago, and one of the main reasons why was because of the inappropriate relationship Joel and Rose had begun subjecting us all to. It started with playfulness between the two; poking fun at each other or brief touching. This only escalated to things like prolonged hugs, visiting each other if they knew the other was on shift, and hanging out one-on-one. At first, my coworkers and I all thought it was strange that these two married people had grown so close so fast, but not our monkey, not our circus. That was until it started affecting the workplace as a whole. Some coworkers were getting written up for ""bullying"" Rose, when in reality, they might have just said or done something she didn't like. Some people were getting frustrated with how long Joel would hang out around the shop off the clock, just because Rose happened to be there. There are other examples of how disruptive their time together is, but the worst of all is that it has been very apparent that Laura, Joel's wife, has no idea where her husband is when we know he's with Rose. 

Multiple times, Laura's shown up looking for him, shortly after we watched him leave with Rose. Or she'll come by and ask if he's there, after he'd just sent a picture of him and Rose together to the work group chat. I left because I was tired of the toxicity that Rose was bringing to the workplace separate from this drama, but also because of the immunity Joel was giving her due to the nature of their closeness. It was incredibly frustrating for me, but at the end of the day, my heart really hurts for Laura. I know if it were MY wife seemingly sneaking around with a ""work hubby"" or ""work wife,"" I would want someone to let me know. Opposite sex friendships have never been wrong in my book, but the secrecy of it all makes me feel gross about what I've witnessed from these two.

So my question is, am I wrong for thinking that Laura deserves to have somebody tell her what's been going on? Would it be wrong of me to be the one to do it since that was a big reason why I quit? Or should I not involve myself at all, considering I dont even work there anymore. Please let me know. My conscience is weighing heavy.
