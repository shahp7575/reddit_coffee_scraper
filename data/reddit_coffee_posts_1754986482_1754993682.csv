1mo4nd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/RagnarokIdleAdventure/comments/1mo4nd2/agi_aspd_tw_ragebait/,AGI / ASPD  Tw [ragebait],"I'm sure many of you guys have fiddled with agility, attack speed, dex, & fixed cast rate in order to capitalize on alleged buff durations, and such. Using the world boss primarily to optimize updates to my team, I encountered something irritating, as someone who tries very hard to understand what is left pitifully unclear in (at least the English version of) the game. 

Trying to fit as many skill casts into a 15s buff duration (Holy Descent), I did the usual attribute-reset-and-add-increments of AGI / ASPD to measure my (knight's) skill rota and ... this time flipped my coffee table figuratively ofc I'm playing in bed but anyway I digress

More attack speed SLOWED down my rota. Now I understand that this had already been studied by an old user whose post I'd read months ago, but that was a discovery for PRIEST (which makes sense to me). What is more upsetting is that usually ASPD functions the way you'd expect it to. But this shit is just a headache at this point bruv

This game is actually certified trash and ima keep playing it but for the love of God lets get this shit fixed or at least explained in even inklings of sense you absolute twats of videogame developers your shitty inconsistentAF descriptions of EVERY aspect of the game are NOT working the way you probably dellude yourselves to thinkin players(like me mhm) will buy their way through IT IS VIOLENTLY PUSHING AWAY YOUR ACTUALLY DEDICATED CUSTOMERS",1,1754993171.0,RagnarokIdleAdventure,0,1.0,False
1mo4mdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TitanQuest2/comments/1mo4mdu/my_feedback_as_an_enthusiastic_casual/,My feedback as an enthusiastic casual,"I bought the EA the other day and have been having a good time with it. I'm the kind of player who really enjoys ARPGs (I have maybe 300 hours in Diablo 3, 250 or so in Grim Dawn, probably had about 100 in Titan Quest 1, did a single Diablo 4 playthrough - lol), but will never, ever read a guide or bother to try and understand any of the in-depth interactions. Basically, if I don't ""get"" how it works from using it in-game, I'll just ignore it. I prefer Rogue/stealth classes.

  
The good:

  
1. I think that TQ2 has some big upgrades over 1 and Grim Dawn, the most noticeable one being that you gain Divinity points separately from your Core points. It always sucked in TQ when you level up 5 times in a row just to invest more points into your stats rather than a cool new ability. I feel like I have a more well-rounded character in the mid 20 levels in TQ2 than at level 40-60 in Grim Dawn.

2. I really like being able to upgrade things like the dash and your basic attack - the dash/teleport makes gameplay feel less rigid than in the past.

  
3. The silly antique atmosphere is back - hammy voice acting, overly dramatic characters, the very on-the-nose music. Glad they kept it

4. The graphics and sound are both pretty good - though I'll admit that most ARPGs eventually digress into being played on mute with a podcast in the background as you start to grind.

5. The abilities feel weighty. When you crush a little spider you really feel like you overkilled it

  
Things to improve:

1. I think the map has been very boring so far. I really dislike fighting flora and fauna (bats, boars, wolves, etc., I'm here to be a hero, not pest control), so there's way too much of that. These kinds of enemies feel super generic and could be in literally any setting in any game. I wish they would commit more to the setting with the enemies. It feels very uninspired and generic. Flooded farmlands? Isn't that just Grim Dawn's first act? I liked that Titan Quest was a bright and colourful ARPG. I think they've gone a bit too dark and washed out with this.

2. Poor performance. I imagine it'll get better optimisation, but I'm currently running it at 1080p on the lowest settings to get a smooth frame rate with a 1080 TI and an overclocked 5820k. This is decently old hardware, but the game doesn't look so impresssive that I don't feel like I should be able to at least get mid settings out of it. Not the end of the world though - it actually looks neat on Low still.

3. The loading and respawn times after you die need to be waaaaaaaaaaay faster. It should just be ""your ded"" -> respawn. I feel like I can go make a cup of coffee and a take a shower every time I die (and I suck at these games so that's a lot).

4. The epic items don't feel epic. Not sure what the point of them is besides being ""bigger"" stat sticks. I also don't feel like we should be finding them before the end of NewGame+. I found three on my first playthrough before level 21. They feel like total throwaways. I shouldn't be finding these until I'm at a high level on a second playthrough and I want them to blow my mind and feel earned.

5. Some comfort functions like a map overlay are missing I believe - I assume this will come

  
I'm going to try it with a few more classes, but also am trying to not overplay it until more content gets added. I think this is a great addition to the genre and hope they finish it.

I can appreciate a broad range of art and music, I'm against being ignorant and hateful, and I'm open minded. I like travelling (just got back from NYC on a solo adventure, saw a Broadway show for the first time) drinking too much coffee. I can play some musical instruments. 

  
I know career and finances are important for my age bracket, while I have had some setbacks, I think I'm going in the right direction. I have a federal job which I've had for a year; it's a modest income with potential in the future.

Crafting a Balanced 1500 Calorie Meal Plan with Everyday Foods
--------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a meal plan with a target of 1500 calories can be both exciting and beneficial if you're looking to maintain or lose weight. Using everyday foods makes the process simpler and more enjoyable. You can still satisfy your taste buds while keeping track of your caloric intake. Let's explore how you can craft a balanced 1500 calorie meal plan using foods you already love.

### Understanding a Balanced Meal Plan

A balanced meal plan should include a mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats. Each meal should contribute to your daily caloric goal without sacrificing nutrition. Aiming for whole foods ensures that your meals are packed with essential nutrients.

#### Breakfast Ideas

Starting your day right can set the tone for the rest of your meals. Here are a couple of breakfast options that keep you energized and within the caloric limit:

- **Greek Yogurt Parfait:** Combine 1 cup of non-fat Greek yogurt, half a cup of mixed berries, and a tablespoon of honey. This meal is approximately 300 calories.
- **Oatmeal Bowl:** Cook ½ cup of rolled oats with water or almond milk. Top with sliced banana and a sprinkle of cinnamon for about 250 calories.

#### Lunch Selections

For lunch, aim for a satisfying meal that won't leave you feeling sluggish. Here are two simple options:

- **Chicken Salad:** Mix 3 oz. grilled chicken breast with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and a tablespoon of vinaigrette. Approximately 400 calories.
- **Quinoa Bowl:** Combine ½ cup cooked quinoa, ½ cup black beans, corn, cilantro, and lime juice for a refreshing dish. This comes in at about 350 calories.

#### Snack Time

Healthy snacking can help maintain energy levels throughout the day. Here are some snacking ideas:

- **Apple with Almond Butter:** A medium apple and one tablespoon of almond butter weigh in around 200 calories.
- **Carrots and Hummus:** Enjoy a cup of baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus for approximately 100 calories.

#### Dinner Delights

Dinner should be filling yet balanced. Here are two options:

- **Baked Salmon:** A 4 oz. portion of salmon paired with roasted broccoli and ½ cup of brown rice is nutritious and flavorful, totaling around 500 calories.
- **Stir-Fry:** Use 3 oz. of lean beef or chicken, along with a mix of bell peppers and broccoli, stir-fried in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Serve this over ½ cup of cooked rice for about 450 calories.

### Monitoring Your Intake

Keep track of your meals and snacks with a journal or an app. This will help you remain mindful about your portions and nutritional choices. When you're aware of what you’re eating, it's easier to stick to your 1500 calorie goal without feeling deprived.

### Adjusting Your Meal Plan

Feel free to swap ingredients and adjust portion sizes based on your preferences and lifestyle. Maybe you love eggs instead of yogurt for breakfast or prefer legumes over chicken for lunch. The key is to keep your meals nutritious and enjoyable.

It's important to consider your specific health goals. If you’re unsure about how to create your meal plan or have unique dietary restrictions, consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian. They can help tailor your 1500 calorie meal plan to fit your needs and ensure you're getting all the vitamins and minerals your body requires.

A 1500 calorie meal plan with normal food can be a great way to nourish your body while working toward your health goals. By focusing on whole foods and maintaining balance, you can enjoy delicious meals that contribute to your overall well-being.

Tips for Sticking to Your 1500 Calorie Meal Goals While Eating Normally
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reaching a goal of 1500 calories per day can seem challenging, especially if you want to eat normal foods. However, with some practical tips and strategies, you can achieve your nutrition goals while enjoying a variety of meals. Here are some effective ways to stick to your 1500 calorie meal plan without feeling deprived.

### Understand Your Food Choices

Start by familiarizing yourself with the caloric content of different foods. This knowledge empowers you to make informed choices. Use a calorie tracking app or a food diary to record what you eat. This will help you see where you can make small adjustments throughout the day.

### Plan Your Meals

Meal planning is crucial for success in a 1500 calorie meal plan. Consider these strategies:

- **Work with a template:** Create a weekly meal template that includes breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. This reduces decision fatigue and helps you stay consistent.
- **Choose nutrient-dense foods:** Focus on foods high in fiber and protein to keep you full longer. This includes veggies, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, and legumes.
- **Prep in advance:** Spend some time each week to prepare meals ahead. This ensures you have healthy options ready when you're hungry.

### Portion Control Matters

Portion sizes make a significant difference in calorie intake. Here are tips for managing portions effectively:

- **Use smaller plates:** Eating from smaller dishes can help trick your brain into thinking you're consuming more food.
- **Measure your food:** Use measuring cups or a kitchen scale to better understand serving sizes. This helps avoid overeating.
- **Mindful eating:** Pay attention to each bite by eating slowly. Enjoy the flavors, and stop when you feel satisfied.

### Strategically Use Snacks

Snacking doesn't have to derail your meal plan. Here are some healthy snack ideas that won’t blow your calorie goals:

- **Air-popped popcorn:** A great low-calorie option for snacking, high in fiber.
- **Greek yogurt:** Packed with protein, opt for unsweetened varieties to limit added sugars.
- **Cut-up veggies:** Carrot sticks, cucumber slices, or bell pepper strips with hummus are delicious and filling.

### Stay Hydrated

Drinking enough water can help you manage hunger. Sometimes, we mistake thirst for hunger. Here are some advantages of staying hydrated:

- **Promotes fullness:** Drinking a glass of water before meals can help you eat less.
- **Aids digestion:** Staying hydrated supports your body's digestive processes, which is crucial on a calorie-controlled diet.
- **Choose zero-calorie beverages:** Opt for water, herbal teas, or black coffee to stay hydrated without adding extra calories.

### Incorporate Exercise

Physical activity plays a key role in achieving your diet goals. Here's how to make it work for you:

- **Find enjoyable activities:** Whether it’s walking, dancing, or swimming, choose activities you love to stay motivated.
- **Set realistic goals:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise weekly, and remember that every little bit counts.
- **Combine strength training:** Include some weight training sessions to build muscle, which can help you burn more calories even at rest.

### Learn to Customize Recipes

Don't hesitate to modify your favorite recipes to make them lighter. Here are some substitutions:

- **Use lean proteins:** Swap fatty cuts of meat for skinless poultry or plant-based alternatives.
- **Replace high-calorie ingredients:** For example, use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, or applesauce in baking instead of oil.
- **Spice it up:** Enhance flavors with herbs and spices instead of sauces or high-calorie dressings.

Sticking to your 1500 calorie meal goals while enjoying normal food is indeed achievable. With these strategies, you can embrace a healthier lifestyle without sacrificing your favorite meals. Stay consistent and patient, and you’ll see the results of your hard work.

### Conclusion

Developing a sustainable 1500 calorie meal plan with normal food can be a rewarding journey toward healthier eating habits. By focusing on balanced nutrition, you can create meals that not only taste great but also keep you satisfied and energized throughout the day. a variety of food groups ensures that your body receives the necessary vitamins and minerals it needs while you stay within your calorie goals.

As you start implementing your meal plan, remember that flexibility is key. Use the tips provided, such as meal prepping and keeping healthy snacks handy, to help you stick to your daily targets with ease. Setting small, achievable goals can also motivate you to stay on track without feeling overwhelmed. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection—celebrate your small victories along the way!

Engaging in mindful eating practices can make a significant difference. Paying attention to hunger cues and savoring each meal can enhance your eating experience. Also, don’t hesitate to experiment with flavors and textures—cooking with familiar, everyday ingredients can make your meals enjoyable and sustainable.

Ultimately, maintaining a 1500 calorie meal plan doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice the foods you love. With careful planning and a positive mindset, you can enjoy a diverse range of foods while achieving your health goals. Embrace this journey, and allow yourself the space to learn and adapt—as you find what works best for you. You’re not just counting calories; you’re building a healthier, happier lifestyle.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a water dispenser with an ice maker hinges on several key features. These specifications directly impact the quality of water, the speed and volume of ice production, and the long-term usability of the appliance.

**Filtration System:** The hallmark of a good water dispenser is its filtration system. Look for multi-stage filtration that removes sediment, chlorine, lead, and other impurities. High-end models frequently enough feature activated carbon filters combined with UV sanitization to eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring water that is not just clean but also safe. The lifespan and replacement cost of the filters are also critically importent considerations.

A subpar filtration setup undermines the core benefit that consumers are searching for in a water dispenser with these features.

**Ice Production Capacity:** Ice production capacity is critical for households or offices with high demands. Specifications to consider include the daily ice production rate,measured in pounds,and the storage capacity of the ice bin. Some dispensers offer different ice cube sizes or specialty ice types, such as nugget ice, catering to preferences for beverages and chilling needs. It is helpful to determine the weekly use of ice to find the correct pound capacity that is needed.

The ice capacity shoudl meet the requirements needed to ensure supply matches demand.

**Water Temperature Options:** Modern water dispensers offer a range of temperature options,including cold,ambient,and hot water. Precise temperature control is a valuable feature, allowing users to select the ideal temperature for various beverages, from iced tea to instant coffee. Some models even offer programmable temperature settings for added convenience.

Precise temperature controls offer the ability to easily cater to varying temperature preferences.

**Dispensing Mechanism and Controls:** The dispensing mechanism should be designed for ease of use and hygiene. Touchless dispensing systems offer a sanitary way to access water, minimizing the spread of germs. Electronic controls should be intuitive and responsive, allowing users to easily select the desired water temperature and dispensing volume. Manny models also have child safety locks to prevent accidental dispensing of hot water.

Look for intuitive designs and controls that make the process of using the dispenser seamless.

**Tank Capacity and Cooling System:** the water tank capacity determines the amount of water that is readily available at each temperature setting. A larger tank reduces the frequency of refills. The cooling system should be efficient and reliable, maintaining a consistent water temperature even during periods of heavy use. Some systems use compressor-based cooling, while others rely on thermoelectric cooling, which tends to be less energy-intensive.

A reliable and efficient cooling system keeps drinks cold during heavy-use periods.

**How loud is the ice maker?**
The noise level of the ice maker varies depending on the model and the ice-making process. Some models use quieter, thermoelectric cooling systems, while others employ compressor-based systems that may produce more noise.

# Trufflez Strain Seeds

Website: 

In the ever-expanding world of [cannabis ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)cultivars, where each strain displays its unique traits, it takes something special to stand out above the rest. The Trufflez weed strain, with its intriguing genetics and enticing sensory profile, is up for the challenge. Trufflez has already garnered a devoted following among enthusiasts seeking a distinctive cannabis experience.

With multiple variants of this [strain ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)available, the exact genetics will depend on where you source your bud. In this article, we’ll shed a little light on the situation, making your selection process easier. Although the ILGM research team does its best to keep all information up to date, some [Trufflez strain](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) info may be unavailable. We will add new information as more becomes available, but for now, let’s unpack what we know.

# Trufflez strain genetics

With hundreds of cannabis strains available on the market, there are bound to be a few that share the same qualities or even the same name (be it calculated or coincidental). The Trufflez name applies to a couple of vastly different cannabis strains (as well as a [brand](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)), but which one came first? Well, that remains a mystery.

# Aficionado Seed Collection’s Trufflez

In one corner, we have Trufflez by Aficionado Seed Collection. They describe their version as Zkittlez and Cherry Noir crossed with their “champion White Cherry Truffle male.”.

[Zkittlez](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), a cross of Grape Ape and [Grapefruit](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), is popular for its delicious flavors, pleasant high, and easy-to-grow nature. Speaking of delicious flavors, Cherry Noir is hard to resist. With its blend of Cherry Lime #4 and [Chemdawg](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) (Special Reserve), Cherry Noir delivers a tasty flavor experience with a potent, long-lasting high. According to sources, Aficionado built upon this impressive lineage by combining Cherry Noir with Highland [Afghani](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) to create their White Cherry Truffle strain.

# Local Grove’s Trufflez

In the other corner, we have Trufflez by Local Grove. This cultivar earned them a 2nd place trophy at the [Cannabis ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)Cup: Michigan People’s Choice 2021. Their Trufflez marijuana strain blends the powerful Jet Fuel Gelato with Runtz. (Not to be confused with the Jokerz strain, which crosses Jet Fuel Gelato with [White Runtz)](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#).

[Runtz](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), which combines Zkittles and Gelato #33, is a potent hybrid regularly used in breeding for its top-shelf lineage. Jet Fuel Gelato is a balanced cultivar with high levels of THC and flavors of sweet fruit, cream, and (you guessed it) fuel. It was created by Compound Genetics, who describe it as a combination of Jet Fuel G6, High Octane, and Gelato 45.

There is also a strain called Truffles (with an “s” not a “z”) from Umami Seed Company. This one uses MacMints #4 and Seattle Soda as the parent plants. However, this Trufflez strain review will focus more on the two previously mentioned blends.

# Is Trufflez strain indica or sativa?

[Cannabis ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)strains can often be separated into 3 categories: indica, sativa, or hybrid. Sativa strains tend to be more uplifting and energizing, whereas indica strains invoke more relaxing and calming effects. A hybrid strain can possess all these qualities in varying degrees. However, ultimately, the effects depend on the plant’s genetic make up as well as the growing methods used. In the case of [Trufflez](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), both versions seem to be indica-dominant hybrids.

# Growing Trufflez strain

Aficionado released their Trufflez [marijuana ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)strain as a limited one-time offer, with only 500 boxes available, making it a rare cultivar to acquire. Still, there is more grow information available on this version than the one by Local Grove. So, let’s take a look.

According to sources, [Trufflez](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) has shown to have a high [germination ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)rate, with most seeds developing into healthy plants. You’ll need some cultivation experience, though. It’s got a healthy track record for growing both indoors and outdoors, thriving in moderate temperatures with plenty of [sunlight](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#). They can be susceptible to mildew and mold, but having a good grasp of growing techniques can help you bypass some of those obstacles. These techniques include general pruning, low-stress training (LST), and Screen of Green ([SCROG](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)). Our plant [protector ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)can also help you keep your plants healthy.

The Trufflez weed strain can grow into a beautiful, dark green plant with shades of light green and lime, hints of cherry red, and a generous amount of crystal trichomes. By using the correct cultivation techniques, you can encourage healthy growth and top resin production, ensuring that each bud is packed to the brim with [cannabinoids](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) and terpenes.

# Trufflez strain flowering time and yield

Trufflez has a fairly short flowering time of around 8–9 weeks, leaving late September to early October the prime time to harvest.

Disclaimer: The average yield of any cannabis plant depends on several factors, including the cultivator’s skill, growing conditions, strain genetics, and the plant’s size and health. It also differs between [photoperiod ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)and [autoflower](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) plants. However, you can use general estimates as a potential yield per plant guideline.

For photoperiod plants, this is 16–64 ounces (450–1814 grams) outdoors and 8–24 ounces (227–680 grams) indoors.

# Trufflez strain autoflowering time and yield

[Autoflowers ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)don’t require a change in the light cycle, making them considerably faster to grow. The first buds typically appear around four to six weeks and have a flowering time between four and ten weeks.

Like most [autoflowers](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), the Trufflez strain will be ready to harvest after ten to fourteen weeks with a potential yield per plant of 1.7–7 ounces (50–200 grams) outdoors and 1.7–4.2 ounces (50–120 grams) indoors.

# Trufflez strain effects

It goes without saying that when you buy your bud, it’s wise to rely on reputable sources to ensure that you’re actually getting what you’re paying for. Especially when there are different strains with the same name. Fortunately, both versions of Trufflez seem to have similar effects.

According to [consumers](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), the effects come on quickly, spreading a light tingle throughout your body. It fills you with upliftment, happiness, contentment, and even chattiness. The initial buzz is charged and euphoric but soon evolves into a state of calm [relaxation](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#) that’s perfect for shaking off stress, anxiety, and tension.

Many consumers report its therapeutic benefits in helping them deal with symptoms associated with stress, insomnia, [depression](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#), and hypertension, adding to the strain’s appeal. It’s important to note you could experience mild side effects such as headaches, dry mouth, and couch lock.

# How strong is Trufflez strain?

The Trufflez [cannabis ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)strain appeals to veteran consumers as well as cannabis newcomers. With a THC content that ranges from 15% to 25%. The exact amount will depend on your version and source. This THC level makes it an accessible strain to anyone who’s looking for an excellent buzz.

Commended for its flavor, [Trufflez ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)can credit its sensory decadence to its terpene profile. Terpenes are the compounds found in cannabis that give each strain its unique [flavor ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)and aroma.

Limonene brings a woody pungency to balance out the sweet and citrus floral flavor of linalool. Myrcene adds those fruit and earth elements.

One difference reported is that this version has a far nuttier flavor with notes of rich coffee and sweet caramel. Much like its flavor, the aroma is earthy, mixed with [fresh ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3595301587431145968/4845216559287954866#)fruits and sweet, full-bodied coffee.

It starts to get worse when I am in college; I always get nervous in a crowded room but my head doesn't vibrate back then compared to right now, if I am eating together with friends in a crowded place my head would start to shake and I look stupid/experience difficulty in trying to eat or drink as my head isn't standing still (This doesn't affect me socially though as I can engage in one-on-one conversations with people without my head shaking). Even during writing examinations, it starts normally but as time goes on it would start shaking uncontrollably and it would get very uncomfortable/embarrassing.

What I physically felt is that the back of my neck would ""tense""? up before my head would start shaking. It is physically uncomfortable.

Other unrelated/non-head shaking issues I have is if I try to balance a small cup filled with water in my non-dominant hand, my hand would shake/vibrate like crazy. Or when I am typing too fast in a keyboard my hand would twitch and jump awkwardly.

I don't smoke, drink, do illegal substances or consume coffee.

I am going to the doctor in a few days but I made this post just so that I can expect if what I have is ET or anxiety and not anything worse like neurological problems, and if anyone is facing a similar problem.

The first few times I tried it I thought it tasted like someone just cubed a kitchen sponge and dropped it into a perfectly good sauce. I've tried recipes that marinade it, I press it for an hour with an extremely heavy weight before cooking, I fry each side individually. But each time I eat it, this big alarm bell goes off in my head screaming ""TOFU!!!!"" and it is so distracting, it honestly makes me feel a little sick. 

I really want to like it, as it's a cheap meat alternative and the way it looks is very pretty. The idea of it is great, like a big brick of coagulated soy milk that can pad out a meal. But it almost ""ruins"" whatever I put it in. I'm able to enjoy anything by having it over time until I forget I don't like it, stuff like olives, coffee and kale, but with tofu I just can't. It's bitter and has a really strange texture.

The one I had most recently was ""Cauldron Authentic Press and Cook"", which was well in date, and I did press for an hour with an extremely heavy cast iron pot and lots of kitchen roll. I made a spicy curry which I really enjoy, coated the tofu in soy sauce and dusted it with cornflour and fried each side before adding it to the sauce and simmering for an hour, and every part of the curry was incredibly delicious except the tofu cubes which were just these sad, disappointing cubes that felt like diced gym mat.

1mo448i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonMasters/comments/1mo448i/kicked_a_player_out_for_the_first_time_having/,"Kicked a player out for the first time, having doubts about my decision.","For context, I run games as part of a larger group that runs games out of a local bar and does some online play. I run a campaign online with five players. The player in question has always been a little overbearing in roleplay, some light main character syndrome but none of the other players minded and they have always been incredibly passionate about and invested in my world so I let it slide.

Now, the first big issue came when I ran a one shot a week ago. This was part of our annual epic (a club event of six interconnected one shots followed by two DM's running a parallel adventure with two groups at the same time. It's a big deal for our club). I had spent a whole long weekend solidly printing and painting mini's, terrain etc, literally other than a few breaks for coffee or food I was prepping this game from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed for 3 days straight.

One of the players who came to this one shot was one of my online players, and they were a nightmare. They constantly interrupted, if they weren't interrupting they were sat at the end of the table shouting over me or the other players or singing loudly. They would roll dice and literally hold the dice in my face if I wasn't watching, they got sloppy drunk and smashed glasses. Their in character behaviour was just as bad, they made a point to be as chaotic as possible (they literally stated this as their intention), purposely tripped every trap, attacked monsters while others where trying to stealth etc. I asked three times for them to calm down, lock in and play the game and they just didn't listen. The ONLY reason they didn't get ejected from that game is, unfortunately, they have a lot of trauma and one of their triggers was mentioned and they had a triggered moment that effected them quite badly and I did not want to kick someone out after that. I do not, however, accept this as a reason for their behaviour as they were behaving the same before and after this. It was so bad, and everyone was so checked out, that we got to the final fight and in round 2 I looked around, everyone was on their phone except for our problem player, no one was invested. So I said, okay whatever everyone just roll me a death save, if you pass you escape, if you fail Strahd kills you. The relief on everyone's face was visible.

After the game me and another of the group's DM's were speaking. He had received several complaints about the player's behaviour from the other groups that were running AND the regular patrons of the bar. Frankly, we debated whether we should allow the player to continue playing with the group, but ultimately decided that we would allow them another chance but that I needed to speak to them about their behaviour.

The next morning I did, and whilst they did apologise they did not take real responsibility and the apology was pretty much lip service. They did, however, want to talk extensively about how I chuckled at the joke that triggered them. They told me they weren't sure about staying in my online campaign because of it.

So I apologised, and assured them that I knew it was a trigger for them and it would be avoided in future.

What followed over the next week was a deluge of ""will they won't they"" about playing in the campaign session. They would roleplay on the RP chat, and then message me saying they weren't going to carry on. I suggested they take a break for a week or two to figure things out, they never gave me a response. On Sunday I asked point blank (game is on Monday) are you playing with us on Monday. They asked if I wanted them to. I said ""Yes"", they did not reply. So on Monday, I woke up not knowing if they were going to play in the campaign. I also realised that I had spent so much of my free time trying to get an answer out of them about if they were going to play in the campaign anymore I hadn't had time to prep the session at all, so that's two games in a row that had been adversely affected by this same situation. I got to the end of my tether at that point. There is a huge waiting list for my online game. So I messaged the player and told them that I think it was best if I gave their spot to a new player on the wait list who wasn't going to behave in the way they did and wasn't going to then proceed to mess me around for a week. For context, I already have people that will fill the spots of them and their fiance who also left when I asked them to leave.

They have been begging for their slot back, but I am in two minds. On the one hand they have apologised and they have taken responsibility for their actions now, but only after I kicked them out. They had that opportunity last week and they decided to instead make my life and my prep even more difficult. On the other side, I hate upsetting people.

A technician serviced our machine yesterday and said everything was working perfectly. He turned it off before leaving. This morning we turned it on, waited about 40 minutes, and then tried pulling the first double shot. It was so dark, hardly could come out, the crema was dark dark brown, and the shot was not drinkable. This maybe took 40 seconds or so to pull just 20ml or so (?!?!?). We kept trying and with each consecutive attempt, it seemed to improve. By the 10th try, we were pulling normal double shots in about 27 seconds, with nice looking crema etc. However the taste was still rather strong/acidic.

- **The brain isn’t just a command center—it’s a sculptor of identity.** From childhood to adulthood, our experiences constantly rewire our brains, changing our personalities and the way we see the world. Studies like those of London taxi drivers show just how adaptable our neural pathways can be.

- **What we perceive as reality is a personalized construction.** Our senses and brains work together to interpret the world, creating a unique version of reality for each of us. Phenomena like synesthesia and the story of individuals regaining lost senses highlight just how subjective our experiences can be.

- **Most decisions happen subconsciously.** Whether it’s stacking cups at lightning speed or making snap judgments about people, our brains rely on subconscious processes and sensory cues far more than we realize. Even our moral decisions can be swayed by something as simple as a smell or the warmth of a coffee mug.

- **Social connection is hardwired.** Empathy isn’t just a feeling—it’s a physical process rooted in our ability to mimic and read facial expressions. The brain’s social wiring has helped humans survive and thrive, but it can also be manipulated to distance us from those seen as outsiders.

- **Technology is changing the game—but consciousness remains uniquely human.** While advances like cochlear implants and brain-machine interfaces show how adaptable our minds are, awareness and true understanding set the human brain apart from even the most powerful computers.

1mo422x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1mo422x/an_app_thats_like_a_city_of_bars_but_you_choose/,"An app that's like a city of bars, but you choose which one to enter based on the music and the vibe inside.","I've been working on an idea to tackle that feeling of being alone while working, studying, or just chilling late at night. You want some background music, but you can't decide what to play, and listening by yourself feels a bit isolating.

So, I'm building an app that's like a hub of virtual listening rooms, open for anyone to join.

Here's the concept:

When you open the app, you don't see a list of friends. Instead, you see a lobby of active, public ""Vibe Rooms"" created by other users. Each room has a name and a mood, like:

  
For Chilling, Studying, or Working:

* **Lofi beats for late-night coding**
* **Rainy Day & Chill Indie**
* **Deep Focus: Ambient & Instrumental**
* **Sunday Morning Coffee & Jazz**
* **Essay due in 2 hours / I'm cooked**

# For Emotional or Moody Vibes:

* **Sad Girl Hours 🥀**
* **Existential Dread but with a Beat**
* **Post-Breakup Catharsis (Angry Songs Only)**
* **Staring at the Ceiling at 3 AM**
* **Main Character Moment**

# For Upbeat & Fun Moods:

* **80s Throwback Party** 
* **Friday Night Hype!**
* **Cleaning the House Power Hour**
* **2000s Pop-Punk Nostalgia Trip**
* **Driving with the windows down**

You can see how many people are in each room and what song is currently playing. You just tap to join, and instantly, you're hearing the exact same music, perfectly in sync with everyone else in that room. You can chat with the other listeners, or just lurk and enjoy the shared atmosphere. It's like walking into different cafes or bars and choosing one based on the music and the crowd inside.

Of course, you can also be the one to set the vibe. You can create your own public room, become the ""DJ"" by adding songs from YouTube, and see who joins you. Other listeners can suggest songs, which you can approve to add to the queue, making it a collaborative experience even with people you've just met.

The goal is to create a sense of passive companionship. You're all in your own spaces, but you're connected by a shared soundtrack. It's for discovering music, finding people with similar tastes, or just having some background noise that feels a little less lonely.

I've actually gotten most of the core features working: the public room browser, the perfectly synced YouTube playback, live chat, and the host/suggestion system are all functional. It still needs a lot of polishing on the design and user experience before I'd ever call it ""released,"" though.

I wanted to post it here to get some honest feedback on the concept. Is this an app you could see yourself using when you need some background noise or want to feel a sense of shared presence?

((The location was The Leela Palace, Chanakyapuri.)) THESE PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO AFFORD THIS HOTEL FOR THE FUNCTION, BUT NO MONEY FOR THE FOOD FOR US.

So, we were told to reach hotel by 8:30-9:00. A tourist vehicle picked us from campus and dropped us off at the hotel.

Since we had to wake up too early to get ready and reach there, no one could have had breakfast (hostels usually serve breakfast after 8).

When we entered the hotel, we saw everyone having breakfast, so our senior asked the NDTV team first if we were allowed, to have breakfast. They said yes, around 9:50 (in batches of 2 students). When our seniors went there, the team head of NDTV (an old lady) shouted at them and made them stop eating. When they had just begun, some of them had to leave their untouched coffee, scolded in such a manner, and one criedd, just because they were having breakfast????

That was not the end, during the whole session, we were treated as outcasts (mind you, they invited us with great excitement and respect to attend the event), the same lady kept scolding.

Cool, we had no breakfast. Coming forward to lunch, we were told that we would be served lunch, very clearly. Guess what? They made us exit right in front of the people who were having lunch, standing in queue for the buffet.

And we with empty stomachs and tired brains, were made to exit, right in front of the food and they handed us a small-sized pizza at the end, and that was it.

I hope someone from other media channels notice it and publish itt


I want it to reach people, especially students, to make them aware about the mistake of accepting such inviation, like we did. 

And to media channels, that No, you can't keep treating students like that. 

Note - We were called, because we are students of Department of environmental Studies and event wasaround bio fuel, we went there for exposure and were asked to come up with questions. ",19,1754990973.0,IndiaSpeaks,2,1.0,False

wanted to share our recent road trip story with the Dolphin Surf Boost.

Due to some last-minute issues with our main car, we had to take our recently purchased BYD Dolphin Surf Boost on a 4-week journey — something we hadn’t originally planned.

Route:

From Barcelona (province) to Germany, the greater Cologne area.

Then across to Zwickau in eastern Germany.

And finally back down to Spain.
Total distance travelled: ~4,000 km

Experience on the road:

Surprisingly, range was never an issue.

We settled into a rhythm of charging every 2–2.5 hours, which fit perfectly with our small breaks (coffee, dog walk, quick power nap, breakfast/lunch/dinner).

While the Dolphin isn’t marketed as a long-range cruiser, the drive was smooth and pleasant, and seats stayed comfortable even after many hours.

Takeaway:
This trip actually convinced us that BYD’s approach works for us — for our  main car we’ll go now for the Dolphin Design.

Sometimes life throws surprises, and this time it turned into a memorable road trip with zero stress about range.

Happy to answer any questions if someone’s thinking about longer journeys in the Dolphin.",3,1754990801.0,BYD,7,1.0,False

The centerpiece is freshly baked scones, served warm, accompanied by clotted cream, strawberry jam, and tea. It is a simpler, more casual affair than afternoon tea.Traditionally, the scones are plain or fruit scones, although variations are becoming increasingly common.

**Afternoon Tea: Elaborate Savories and Sweets**

Afternoon tea, originally devised in the 1840s by Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, is a multi-course experience comprised of finger sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam, and a selection of cakes and pastries, all served with tea. The presentation is ofen elaborate, and it's considered a more formal occasion than cream tea. Expect a wider variety of flavors and textures.**Tea Selection: Cream Tea emphasizes Simplicity**

Imagine you're scrolling through Instagram during your morning coffee when you notice a notification. Another commission just hit your account. No sales call. No product creation. No showing your face on camera.

Just pure profit from a system that works while you sleep.

This isn't some fantasy scenario. With affiliate marketing expected to reach $31.7 billion in value with an 8% compound annual growth rate through 2031, thousands of regular people are building legitimate income streams using smart automation strategies.

The game has changed. While everyone's burning out creating endless content and chasing followers, a small group of savvy entrepreneurs discovered something different. They're making serious money with just 20 minutes of daily work using what's called ""Affiliate Automation.""

# What Exactly Is Affiliate Automation?

Let me break this down in plain English.

Traditional affiliate marketing feels like a hamster wheel. You create content, post constantly, engage with followers, handle customer questions, and pray the algorithm likes you today. It's exhausting and unpredictable.

Affiliate Automation flips that script completely.

Instead of being a content slave, you become a systems architect. You set up smart processes that work automatically, promoting high-value products while you focus on living your life.

The best part? You don't need to be camera-ready or have thousands of followers to start earning commissions that actually matter.

# The Three Pillars That Make This Work

**Smart Content Strategy**: Rather than creating original content from scratch, you leverage proven viral posts and adapt them for your niche. This eliminates the guesswork and gives you content that already has engagement momentum.

**Automation Tools**: AI-driven automation is reshaping affiliate marketing, with tools helping improve targeting, efficiency, and providing real-time insights into campaign performance. These systems handle the repetitive tasks so you can focus on strategy.

**High-Value Offers**: Instead of promoting $20 products for tiny commissions, you focus on offers that pay $1,000 to $2,500 per sale. This single shift multiplies your earning potential without extra work.

[**Learn the complete system here →**](https://softtechhub.us/The%20Affiliate%20Automation%20Academy)

# Why Instagram Is the Perfect Platform for This System

Instagram might seem oversaturated, but that's exactly why it's perfect for automation strategies. The platform rewards engagement over follower count, which means a well-crafted post can reach thousands of people regardless of your account size.

The algorithm loves short, engaging videos that keep people watching. When you post content that has already proven successful elsewhere, you're essentially guaranteed higher completion rates. Higher completion rates mean more reach, which translates to more potential customers seeing your affiliate links.

# The 20-Minute Daily Workflow

Here's what your day actually looks like with this system:

**Morning Check (5 minutes)**: Review overnight performance and respond to any direct messages from potential customers.

**Content Posting (10 minutes)**: Upload your pre-selected viral content using the scheduling tools recommended in the system.

**Engagement Boost (5 minutes)**: Interact with comments and engage with accounts in your target market to maintain algorithmic favor.

That's it. No marathon content creation sessions. No stressing about what to post. No complex technical setup.

The automation handles lead nurturing, follow-up sequences, and even preliminary customer questions through smart messaging systems.

# Real People, Real Results

Sarah, a busy mom from Texas, was skeptical when she first heard about affiliate automation. She'd tried traditional affiliate marketing before and barely made enough to cover her hosting costs.

Within her first month using the system, she earned her first $1,000 commission. By month three, she was averaging $3,500 weekly. The difference? She stopped trying to be an influencer and started being a smart marketer.

Then there's Marcus, who was working 60-hour weeks at his corporate job. He started his affiliate automation business during lunch breaks and evenings. Eight months later, he handed in his resignation letter. His automated system was generating more monthly income than his salary.

These aren't overnight success stories or lucky breaks. They're the natural result of applying proven systems consistently.

# Breaking Down the Numbers

Let's talk real math, not fantasy projections.

A typical affiliate promoting a $27 product earns about $13 per sale. To make $1,000 weekly, you'd need roughly 77 sales. That requires significant traffic and conversion optimization.

With high-ticket affiliate offers paying $1,000+ commissions, you only need one sale weekly to hit four figures monthly. The traffic requirements drop dramatically, making success much more achievable for regular people.

When you combine this with automated systems that nurture leads and present offers while you sleep, the math becomes even more favorable.

[**See the complete breakdown here →**](https://softtechhub.us/The%20Affiliate%20Automation%20Academy)

# The Technology Behind the Magic

Modern affiliate marketing leverages adaptive intelligence and AI tools that create campaigns evolving in real time, responding to shifts in user behavior and market trends.

The automation tools handle several critical functions:

**Content Curation**: Smart algorithms identify high-performing content in your niche that's ripe for adaptation.

**Posting Optimization**: Systems determine the best times to post for maximum engagement based on when your audience is most active.

**Lead Management**: Automated messaging sequences nurture prospects through the buying process without your constant attention.

**Performance Tracking**: Real-time analytics show which content drives results, so you can double down on what works.

These aren't complicated systems requiring technical expertise. Modern platforms make this accessible to anyone willing to follow step-by-step instructions.

# Why Most People Fail at Affiliate Marketing

The biggest mistake people make is treating affiliate marketing like social media influencing. They think success comes from personality, charisma, or going viral by chance.

That approach leads to inconsistent results and eventual burnout.

Successful affiliate automation focuses on systems, not personality. It's about creating predictable processes that generate consistent results regardless of whether you feel motivated today.

The most successful practitioners treat it like a business, not a hobby. They track numbers, optimize based on data, and scale what works while eliminating what doesn't.

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Platform Dependency**: Building your entire business on one platform is risky. Smart automation systems diversify traffic sources.

**Low-Value Offers**: Promoting cheap products means you need massive volume to generate meaningful income. High-ticket offers require fewer conversions for substantial results.

**Manual Processes**: Trying to handle everything yourself limits scalability. Automation tools handle routine tasks so you can focus on strategy.

**Inconsistent Activity**: Success requires consistent daily action, even if it's just 20 minutes. Sporadic efforts produce sporadic results.

# The Investment Required to Start

One of the biggest advantages of affiliate automation is the low barrier to entry. You don't need:

* Expensive inventory
* Physical storefront
* Large team
* Massive advertising budget
* Technical development skills

Your main investments are time (about 20 minutes daily) and the learning curve to understand the system. Most successful practitioners invest in education first, then gradually scale their operations as profits increase.

The learning phase typically takes 2-4 weeks to complete, depending on how quickly you implement the training. After that, the system becomes largely automated with minimal daily maintenance required.

# Advanced Strategies for Scaling

Once you have a basic system generating consistent commissions, several scaling strategies can multiply your results:

**Multiple Traffic Sources**: Diversify beyond Instagram to include other platforms where your content can be repurposed.

**Backend Offers**: Introduce additional products to existing customers, increasing lifetime value per customer.

**Automation Optimization**: Refine messaging sequences and posting schedules based on performance data.

**Niche Expansion**: Replicate successful systems in related markets to increase overall revenue potential.

The key is scaling systematically rather than randomly adding complexity. Each expansion should be tested and proven before full implementation.

# Long-Term Vision

The trend in 2025 shows affiliates becoming advertisers rather than simply driving traffic, with tools enabling them to create landing pages and run sophisticated marketing campaigns.

Smart practitioners view affiliate automation as a stepping stone to building comprehensive marketing businesses. The skills, systems, and income generated create opportunities for larger ventures.

Some graduates of the system eventually launch their own products, having learned customer psychology and marketing automation. Others build agencies helping businesses implement similar systems.

The foundation you build with affiliate automation creates multiple future pathways for growth.

# Getting Started: Your Next Steps

The learning curve isn't steep, but it does require commitment to following the system exactly as outlined. Most successful students spend their first week setting up their Instagram profiles and automation tools, then gradually increase their daily posting consistency.

The training covers everything from account setup to advanced scaling strategies. You'll learn to identify winning offers, create automated posting schedules, and optimize conversion rates through testing.

Support comes through community forums where other practitioners share experiences and troubleshoot challenges together. This collaborative environment accelerates learning and provides ongoing motivation.

# What Success Looks Like

Success with affiliate automation isn't about becoming internet famous or building a personal brand. It's about creating predictable income through systematic processes.

You'll know the system is working when:

* Commission notifications become routine rather than exciting surprises
* Your income remains consistent regardless of how much time you invest daily
* You can take vacations without revenue dropping
* Scaling up feels manageable rather than overwhelming

This business model prioritizes freedom and sustainability over vanity metrics like follower counts or viral moments.

# The Competitive Advantage

For every $1 invested in affiliate marketing, brands earn an average of $12, yet most affiliates are still manually managing processes that could be automated.

While competitors exhaust themselves with manual posting schedules and constant content creation, your automated systems work continuously. This creates a significant competitive advantage that compounds over time.

Your content strategy focuses on proven winners rather than experimental posts. Your posting schedule optimizes for algorithmic favor rather than random timing. Your lead nurturing happens automatically rather than manually.

These efficiencies add up to substantial advantages in both time management and revenue generation.

# Industry Evolution

The affiliate marketing landscape continues evolving toward automation and intelligence. Early adopters of these systems position themselves advantageously for continued growth.

Traditional approaches become less effective as platform algorithms favor consistent, engaging content over sporadic viral attempts. Automated systems excel in this environment by maintaining consistent quality and timing.

Smart marketers recognize this shift and adapt their strategies accordingly. Those who resist automation risk being left behind as the industry matures.

[**Position yourself advantageously →**](https://softtechhub.us/The%20Affiliate%20Automation%20Academy)

# Addressing Common Concerns

**""Is this too good to be true?""** The results are real, but they require consistent implementation of the system. Success isn't guaranteed, but it's much more likely when following proven processes.

**""Do I need technical skills?""** The system is designed for non-technical users. If you can use Instagram and follow step-by-step instructions, you have sufficient skills to start.

**""Will this work in my niche?""** The principles apply across most markets, though some niches convert better than others. The training helps identify the most profitable opportunities.

**""How much time does it really take?""** The daily maintenance averages 20 minutes once systems are established. Initial setup requires more time investment, typically 2-4 hours weekly during the first month.

# Making Your Decision

The affiliate automation opportunity exists within a specific window. As more people adopt these strategies, competition increases and results may become more difficult to achieve.

Early adopters benefit from less competition and more available opportunities. Platform algorithms haven't yet adapted to identify and limit automated strategies.

Your decision timeline matters. Waiting to start means missing potential income that compounds over time. Starting today begins the learning process immediately.

The cost of education is minimal compared to potential returns. Most successful students recover their investment within their first few commissions.

# Taking Action

Knowledge without implementation produces no results. The most comprehensive training system becomes worthless without consistent daily application.

Success stories share common elements: they started quickly, followed instructions precisely, and maintained consistency even when initial results seemed slow.

Your success follows the same pattern. Start with the training, implement the systems exactly as taught, and maintain daily consistency regardless of early outcomes.

The compound effect of consistent daily actions creates momentum that becomes increasingly difficult to stop.

[**Begin your journey here →**](https://softtechhub.us/The%20Affiliate%20Automation%20Academy)

# The Bottom Line

Affiliate automation represents a genuine opportunity to build location-independent income using proven systems and modern technology. The results aren't instantaneous, but they're achievable for people willing to learn and implement consistently.

The investment required is minimal compared to traditional business models. The time commitment fits around existing responsibilities. The income potential scales based on your commitment and implementation quality.

Success requires treating this as a real business rather than a side hobby. Professional approaches produce professional results.

The window for maximum opportunity remains open, but it won't last indefinitely. Platform algorithms evolve, competition increases, and regulatory changes may affect strategies.

Starting today positions you to benefit from current market conditions while building skills and systems that adapt to changes.

The choice is straightforward: continue current income strategies with their limitations and frustrations, or invest in learning systems that create freedom and scalability.

Your decision determines your trajectory for the coming months and years.

So I figured I'd just toss the first couple parts of the story I'm working on, titled ""Last flight of the SLUF"" here for everyone to see/read/hopefully enjoy. Maybe this time, it'll work.

While Top Gun was still a cultural touchstone of my Millennial childhood, what *really* got me into fighter jets and flying was when my dad brought home a blazing fast Pentium 90 with an incredible (you're not going to believe this) 64mb of RAM. The very first game I got to bring home for this beast of a battlestation was Jane's US Navy Fighters. I spent many an evening launching F-14s, F-18s, and even F-104s for some reason, off the Ike (which, somehow, got into the Black Sea). But my favorite was the A-7E. I dunno why! I loved how it looked, how it flew. I spent a lot of hours 

So 30 years later, here's my homage!  


**The Bosphorus Passage**

My hands grip the steel railing of the catwalk, and I can feel the *Eisenhower*'s engines thrumming through my bones. Capable hands, my flight instructor used to say, but they're not a young man's hands anymore. That’s for damn sure. The tan line where my wedding ring used to be faded years ago, about the same time Linda decided she'd had enough of Navy wives' clubs and uncertain schedules. 

Can't say I blame her.

The brass in DC called it ""freedom of navigation."" The Turks called it a ""one-time security transit."" The news anchors just called it ""The Bosphorus Crisis."" I called it Tuesday.

I should be on a layover in Chicago right now, complaining about the hotel coffee and calculating my per diem. Instead, I'm watching the ancient skyline of Istanbul slide past at a crawl, the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia looking like something out of a history book while a hundred thousand tons of American diplomacy squeezes through a waterway that's barely wide enough for a container ship.

The call came four weeks ago. Not a dramatic plea for my country, just a sterile voice from the Bureau of Naval Personnel informing me that VA-72, my old reserve squadron, was being recalled to active duty. No ""please,"" no ""thank you for your service."" Just instructions to report to Oceana within seventy-two hours. I'd been flying weekend warrior missions for years, keeping my hand in, but this wasn't a drill.

From where I stand on the island, I can see the whole flight deck spread out below. The F-14 Tomcats look like peacocks—all swept wings and predatory grace, high-maintenance prima donnas that cost more per flight hour than most people make in a year. The F/A-18 Hornets are the accountants of naval aviation—efficient, multi-role, reliable, but lacking soul. Clean lines and digital displays, the future of carrier aviation.

Then there are my birds.

Way aft, looking squat and pugnacious next to their sleeker cousins, sit the A-7E Corsair IIs. SLUFs, we called them. Short Little Ugly Fuckers. The Navy retired them, mothballed the whole community, but President Dole's new foreign policy created a demand for mud-movers that outstripped the supply of shiny new Hornets. So some genius at the Pentagon decided to dust off a handful of reserve squadrons still flying the old attack jets. They didn't want the best tool for the job—they wanted the cheapest one that would still work.

The morning call to prayer drifts across the water, mixing with the cry of gulls and the distant honking of Istanbul traffic. It's an alien sound, layered over the familiar vibration of the ship's screws and the whisper of morning wind across the flight deck. The usual roar of launch operations is conspicuously absent. Even the deck apes are just standing around, watching. Turkish pilot boats flank us on both sides, their crews making sure we don't wander outside the narrow channel. On the European shore, crowds have gathered on the waterfront. I squint and raise my coffee mug in a friendly gesture.

""Hey, they're waving back,"" I mutter… then catch myself. That's not waving. That's a different kind of gesture entirely, the international sign for ""Yankees go home."" A few Turkish flags flutter from apartment balconies, but there are other banners too, the kind that don't exactly wish us fair winds and following seas.

The smell of roasting chestnuts and diesel exhaust from the ferries mixes with the familiar cocktail of salt air and JP-5. It's like my two worlds—civilian airline pilot and weekend warrior—are colliding in real time. Six months ago, my biggest worry was turbulence over Atlanta. Now I'm sailing into what might become World War Three in an airplane that was supposed to be in a museum.

The flight deck is quiet. Too quiet. Even the fighter jocks are subdued, just watching the shores slip by. Everyone understands what this passage means. We're sailing into a box with only one way out, and the Russians are waiting on the other side.

My coffee has gone cold in my hands, bitter as the morning light shifts from gold to gray. Ahead, the mouth of the Black Sea opens like a throat, and I can see the first hint of open water beyond the ancient walls of the city.

The whole world was watching us sail into the Black Sea. I just wondered who'd be watching us try to sail out.



**Milk Run**

The VA-72 ""Blue Hawks"" ready room feels like it belongs on a different ship. Hell, a different decade. While the Hornet and Tomcat squadrons get the updated spaces with digital displays and newer furniture, we're stuck with worn leather chairs that have seen three generations of pilots and walls covered in actual paper charts. The air smells like stale coffee, old flight gear, and that particular mustiness that comes from too many nervous men in too small a space.

I'm standing at the front of the room, going over the morning's target folder with my four-ship. My voice is a low monotone as I walk through ingress routes, target coordinates, and fuel states—the same ritual I've done a thousand times in a dozen ready rooms. Junior, my wingman, sits in the front row taking meticulous notes like he's still in flight school. Kid's eager, I'll give him that.

""Primary target is a supply depot, grid 4-7-2-1-5-9,"" I'm saying when the door slides open with a metallic scrape.

Spade leans against the frame like he owns the place. Fresh haircut, pressed flight suit, that confident smirk that comes with flying the Navy's latest and greatest. He jerks his thumb at the mission board.

""Hey Digger, hitting the beach already? Don't get any scratches on those museum pieces. We need 'em for the Smithsonian when this is over.""

Junior mutters something under his breath that sounds like ""jerk,"" but I don't look up from my chart.

""Just making sure you kids have something to protect,"" I tell Spade, still focused on the coordinates. ""Now if you don't mind, we've got bombs to drop.""

Spade gives a mock salute and disappears down the passageway, probably off to brief his own flight in their fancy new ready room with the big-screen displays.

Famous wasn't the word I'd have used for what we were doing here. The chyron on the muted CNN feed in the corner kept rotating through phrases like ""naval readiness"" and ""security commitments."" The talking heads were calling it ""honoring our obligations to Ukraine""—the Budapest Memorandum, they reminded anyone who'd listen. Back in '94, we'd promised to respect Ukrainian sovereignty when they gave up the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Noble words on paper. But nobody had asked the weekend warriors flying twenty-year-old attack jets if we thought honoring Clinton's signature was worth a shooting war with the Russians. An afterthought in someone else's treaty obligation. That's what we really were.

But down in the hangar bay, running my hands along 405's aluminum skin during pre-flight, I know better.

Bureau number 160405. She rolled off the LTV production line in Dallas back in 1980, when I was still in high school dreaming about flying Navy jets. Seventeen years later, she's still here, still ready, still honest. They call her obsolete. I call her home.

My palm finds the familiar dent just aft of the nose gear, a souvenir from a hard landing at Fallon years ago. The aluminum is warm under my fingers, heated by the hangar bay lights. I know every rivet, every panel line, every place where the paint has worn thin from countless pre-flights just like this one. The Hornet guys with their glass cockpits and digital displays don't understand. 

They fly computers. I fly an airplane.

I run through the walk-around by feel as much as sight. Landing gear struts, check. Control surfaces, check. The single intake breathes like a sleeping animal, waiting for the TF41 turbofan to wake up and turn JP-5 into thunder. She's not pretty—Short Little Ugly Fucker, they called her, and the name stuck—but she's honest. When you pull the stick, she turns. When you push the throttle, she goes. When you pickle a bomb, it goes where you aimed it. No surprises, no attitude, just physics and engineering working exactly like they're supposed to.

I climb the crew ladder and settle into the cockpit, and it's like putting on an old jacket. The analog gauges and mechanical switches feel solid under my hands. Real. The Head-Up Display, revolutionary when it was new, still gives me everything I need to put steel on target. No touchscreens, no menu diving, just switches and dials and the kind of feedback that comes through your fingertips and your ass.

This is why I went Reserves instead of transitioning to a desk job when they retired the A-7. This is why I couldn't bring myself to qual on the Hornet, even when they offered. I'd seen the blueprints for the A-7 Plus, the YA-7F Strikefighter—what she could have become with updated engines and avionics. The Navy threw it all away for budget numbers and political correctness, chose the multi-role compromise over the purpose-built perfection.

I couldn't forgive them for that. But I couldn't give her up either.

So here we are, seventeen years after she was built and six years after they said she was done. 405 and me, museum pieces brought out for one last dance. They can call us obsolete all they want.

We'll see who gets the job done",4,1754990049.0,FighterJets,0,1.0,False
1mo3tbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mo3tbz/first_solo_travel_to_vietnam_report/,First solo travel to Vietnam - Report,"I’m a 28F and I recently went on my first solo trip to Vietnam for 15 days. I had posted a few weeks back for recommendations and I got so many from you all. Thank you for all the tips and recommendations ❤️

Getting back to the report - I am absolutely in love with Vietnam. Everything from the food, people, culture, nature - all of it. As a solo female, the country felt absolutely safe too. Faced no issues at all. Vietnam also has so much to offer than no time spent there feels enough! And it has something for everyone - whether you are someone who likes nightlife, beaches, nature, food or want to immerse yourself culturally. 

The places I visited:

1. Hanoi - was initially supposed to be a 3 day stay which got extended to 5 days. And honestly no complaints at all! I am someone who loves to walk around and explore without an itinerary per se, so made the most out of Hanoi. Had a lot of delicious food, wayyy too many coffees and walked a lot! My personal favourites were the Hoan Kiem lake (I went there pretty much everyday) and the women’s museum. Hanoi is pretty chill and you get to learn a lot about Vietnam’s culture here. Highly recommend visiting Hanoi on the weekends because it’s a whole different vibe!

2. Ninh Binh - initially was supposed to be a overnight stay but changed it to a day trip from Hanoi. Ninh Binh was stunning. I chose tran ang over Tam Coc for the boating. However was wayyy too hot on the day I went. Was worth it for the views however

3. Hue - When I say this is underrated I mean it! Barely any tourists compared to hanoi. But has the most gorgeous architecture and some great food (try the bun bo hue here). If you are someone who loves art, architecture and history, please visit hue. It was the imperial capital of Vietnam and is the home to the shrines of the Nguyen emperors. A very underrated experience I had here was the tam giang lagoon, which was my best experience of the 15 days I spent in Vietnam. I also did the Bach Ma forest trek since I had to cancel Sapa (due to the typhoon). Was a lovely experience!

4. Hoi An - very cultural and quaint. The views are stunning at night with all the lamps hanging everywhere. Was here for three days and visited the ancient town & did the Cham Island snorkelling experience. Also got some clothes tailored! And had the Cau lau noodles and the white rose dumplings! 

I skipped on Danang because I was running out of time and decided to spend it in hoi an instead. Skipped Ho Chinh Minh and the south altogether for this trip. I also avoided a few very touristy spots. 

Places I missed which I will do next time: Ha Giang Loop, Sapa (both I decided to not do due to the typhoon, to be on the safe side), Phong Na caves, Phu Coc, Ta Xua

- For intercity travel I used buses which I booked via 12go. For within city, Grab was super useful and affordable. 
- For payments I mostly did cash since only few places accepted cards. 
- For accommodations I stayed in hostels and the experience was very safe. The hostels were affordable and very good quality all in all
- Locals love it when you say Xin Chao & Cam On, you can see their faces light up 😁

I wanted my trip to be focused on food, culture, nature, adventure and that’s what I got! Cannot recommend Vietnam enough. 

And honestly, it’s not the food or the views that makes this country - it’s the people. I have such respect for their resilience and their strength. This was a country that was at war as recent as 1972, yet they welcome all tourists, even French & American with so much warmth. You speak to any local and they will say “we don’t believe in looking back in the past. It’s about looking ahead and focusing on the future”. They also hold a lot of importance for education and believe that is the means for progress. In fact you will come across Vietnamese kids who will talk to you as a way to improve their English and learn about your culture. 

If any locals here, thank you for the warm hospitality and you have my deepest respect 🙏🙏🙏

Sorry I can go on and on - if you are a solo traveller, esp a female planning on visiting Vietnam - happy to answer any of your Qs!",3,1754990048.0,solotravel,3,0.8,False

Summary for those who don't have tiktok:

Mom (username Beautihut) takes 3yo daughter and her mom to coffee shop (Hazel Boutique, Lavallette, NJ). She goes up to order while grandma and daughter sit at table to wait. Hears a loud crash, turns and her 3yo had knocked over the extremely heavy stone table they were sitting at and broke it into a bunch of pieces. Barista was kind, checking on them and telling them it was OK, gets the owner on the phone. Owner says, basically, ""You break it, you buy it and it's $1600."" No empathy, never asks if anyone was hurt. Says mom can't leave until she gets pics of her drivers license and/or credit card. Mom was super apologetic, embarrassed, gives contact info, but ultimately wants to leave so she can properly assess her kid who is completely despondent and freaked out. Takes kid to urgent care, where they tell her she's probably in a bit of shock, but she'll be OK. 

Internet says having a 600lb table that can be tipped over so easily is a safety hazard on the coffee shop's part, and OSHA would like a word. Also that the shop's insurance will likely cover the cost and this mom did nothing wrong. There was mention in the comments of a deleted video from the coffee shop's page where other customers also nearly tipped over that table as well. Another found the actual table on Anthropologie, and it is supposed to be a console table that goes up against a wall, rather than a dining table. The table is top heavy and rests on two stone columns, rather than four table legs like you might traditionally see on an actual table you're supposed to eat at.

England based.,"We own a small, 5 star family restaurant in quite a small town. We are very well known bc it is the only Polish restaurant in a town that has quite a big Polish community. Recently a guy came in asking if we saw his wallet, cause he ""definitely left it here and nowhere else"". There 100% wasn't a wallet. He asked to see the camera footage—to which my Mom admitted was fake. In hindsight wrong move but we didn't think about that really. 

My Mom happened to go out for a coffee with a friend (that he hadn't seen in MONTHS) the next day (divine intervention for real) and the friend started telling her all about this scammer, who not only didn't pay her, but wants ""reparation fees"" for the ""damage that she did"". She works in cleaning. She takes before and after photos, so she has hard proof that the guy is an asshole and will probably win the case. She showed my Mom a picture and ło and behold it's the same guy asking about the wallet!! It clicked he might have been asking about the cameras bc he wanted to know if they were real or not, bc he was planning something! We asked around other friends and they said the same, that he was a terrible person who did his best to take their money.

I was wondering about the extent of the damage he could do to us and what to look out for? I've already ordered cameras and we're gonna install them in the dining room literally tomorrow, but there's also a corridor with stairs leading to the bathroom that im worried about, with no cameras. I'll just say it's unavailable or something short term but long term we might get some cameras there too or something. Even so, what are some of the things he might try to do to try to sue us and swindle us? I'm a bit paranoid as this is our only source of income and we have high fees already to pay. Something like this could ruin us.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!! 😊😄",10,1754989923.0,LegalAdviceUK,12,0.75,False
1mo3rug,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1mo3rug/12082025/,12/08/2025,"IT IS SO COLD. 

It took me quite a long while to fall asleep last night. 

I miss coffee and I don’t. I still have my coffee machine out on the bench but I’m going to give it a solid clean and then put it away. I think eventually you can drink coffee on this medication, but it doesn’t do anything much for me anyway so I doubt I will unless I have days where I don’t take medication and want one. I’ll still get the occasional one when I’m at a cafe and all, but I just mean day to day. I just like the habit of it, the ritual of it even. And a warm drink.  

I hate humans. Well no, but I detest how we’ve ruined this planet. Today I learned about Barbary lions, I’d never heard of them before and they’re extinct now but they were MAJESTIC. The epitome of the word. Extinct due to over hunting. Why can’t people just leave animals alone?! And their habitats! I know I’m more than complicit in it all, I buy stuff that is produced by the people who cut down forests and everything - but I already hate myself and that’s one of my reasons why. I think a lion would be better for this planet than me, easily. I just take take take take take, animals only take what they absolutely need and there’s a whole cycle to it and anyway I’m not saying anything worthwhile, I just resent humans so much sometimes. Not HUMANS - but what we’ve become, I should say. 

I went for a walk for about an hour before 4 hours of back to back meetings which was nice, though I was frozen solid even though I was walking fast and up and down hills. Like I got hot… but was still frozen. I should win an award for my abilities in story telling. 

My song of the day is a mini throw back, that the tree I climb song - I don’t know what that instrument is, a trumpet? I’m not good at recognising instruments or differentiating them. I can *probably* tell if it’s percussion, woodwind, strings, brass or piano/keyboard and that’s it. My honey’s musical knowledge is something I forever love about him, it’s so hot, and interesting and he fills my gaps in knowledge (aka everything) which is amazing. He’s so dreamy. My dreamy baby. 

Then I just worked til 8:40ish. Then I showered - I used a new body wash which is *very* edible smelling - caramelly, syrupy, vanillery and a bit sandalwoody - a bit much for me personally, I like all those notes but I also don’t like to smell like a cheap hooker yknow (rude of me but anyway, also it doesn’t smell like that I just mean idk it’s so… IDK) but if I use more sparingly it might be a softer scented nice lil shower rinsey rinse. 

Now I’m in bed :) Yay! 

I feel bad for saying cheap hooker smell earlier, see, I am not a nice girl at all. A nasty one, actually. Sorry.

Visited the new Mecca Bourke St store this morning, I like (not love) Mecca so here are my thoughts. 

I attended for a fragrance consultation which was good, they start with getting you to smell 7 different main body notes and selecting your favourites. From there the consultant will go away and select some fragrances they think you will like, it’s basically trial and error until you find something you like. I did mention I wanted an eau de parfum and the consult didn’t go for the full hour, but the one I ended up liking most was an eau de toilette. They do offer you complimentary still or sparkling water which is a nice touch (would have liked a coffee but it’s better than nothing). 

All the perfume is on level 3 along with the cafe, salons, and Mecca Aesthetica, it’s well laid out with clear stands for each brand. Seemed a bit more considered in design and layout than the lower floors. There’s a cool “scentsorium” to learn the differences between notes, there’s a table with like long pipes where you can smell the different notes. They seem to have every fragrance from every brand they stock which is a big plus. 

Didn’t check out much of level 2 but it mostly seemed to be gifting along with the apothecary and florist. All the makeup and skincare is on level 1. Level 1 was definitely the busiest level and densest in terms of occupation of floor space, was a bit harder to get around but not to the point of overload. 

I really like having the concierges throughout the store, it’s a great help. I interacted with about 10 different staff members during my visit and all were super lovely. I did also get two full size samples, one at checkout and one from the consult (the Drunk Elephant bronzing drops and the Arkive hair primer) which ended up being $100 of value for free which was unexpected. 

Honestly it’s less overwhelming than I expected, granted this was midday on a weekday and I probably won’t venture in on a weekend just yet but I will be keen to explore more of levels 2 and 3. ",11,1754989788.0,AusSkincare,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone!

What’s your opinion on budget-friendly coffee grinders for beginners? I was recently gifted a Breville Bambino Plus, but when I saw the price of the matching Breville grinder… yikes ( broke uni student) . I’m hoping to find something a bit cheaper that still works well for espresso.

Right now, I’m thinking about purchasing the Baratza Encore, but I’m not sure if it’s the best choice for a beginner who mostly wants to make espresso.

I’m totally new to the world of home espresso, so all the talk about scales, grinders, and beans has my head spinning 😂 Any tips or recommendations would be amazing!

I usually go out with my friends one or two Saturdays a month, and I end up so mentally drained that it isolates me for a long time. The thing is, two months ago I had an appointment every Friday, and when I finished, there was a coffee shop nearby. The first few weeks I'd grab a drink and go home, but then I decided to give myself some time without worrying about the rest of the world. Now I'd grab a drink and spend an hour reading or writing about my day or listening to music. I've noticed that Saturdays aren't so exhausting for me anymore. I still need to recharge the next day, but it doesn't isolate me for as long. It's probably not a big deal, but for me it's been a huge step forward.

\>>>>



I’m going to tell you about a theory of reality management called by the strange word \*Transurfing\*. What is Transurfing? Honestly, I don’t know where this word came from or how it appeared in my mind. I don’t think it carries the exact meaning that its English-sounding pronunciation might suggest. But I don’t think that’s the point. The essence of Transurfing as a technique for managing reality lies in the fact that we can, through the power of our intention and will, choose the life paths we want. Instead of drifting aimlessly like a paper boat on the waves, we can steer the course of our destiny as we please.



Let’s start with the concept of fate. There are three main perspectives on fate. The first says that fate is predetermined. The second claims that fate is entirely in a person’s hands. The third suggests that fate is shaped by past lives, or what is called karma. So, which of these perspectives is correct? I would say all three are true. Why is that? That’s what we’re going to explore.



Those familiar with Islamic principles may understand the meaning of the phrase that a person’s life is written in a book. This implies that everything—past and future—is already recorded somewhere, unchangeable. However, this is a one-sided interpretation. If you carefully read the Holy Quran, it states that a person doesn’t have just one fate or one life path but a whole tree of possible life paths. Transurfing is about gliding along these life paths—not randomly, at the mercy of circumstances, but deliberately, as the master of your own destiny.



Why is this possible? The thing is, our world is a dual mirror. On one side is the material universe, and on the other lies a metaphysical space of possibilities. In this space, everything that was, is, and will be is recorded. The number of possibilities is infinite. It may seem strange—how can the past, present, and future exist simultaneously? In our reality, we observe events unfolding: the past is behind us, the present is here, and the future lies ahead. But human perception constructs time as a flow, an illusion. In reality, time doesn’t exist—it’s merely the movement of a frame on a film reel.



To put it simply, the space of possibilities is like a vast archive of film reels, containing everything that could be and everything that could be realized. It might seem odd—who recorded all these events that exist simultaneously as static matrices? But this is a quirk of human perception. The human mind is convinced that everything must have a creator, a beginning, and an end. However, the space of possibilities has always existed—it has no beginning or end. If we talk about infinity, you might imagine it as something vast and boundless. Or you can think of infinity as a point, like an atom. Imagine moving infinitely inward within that point—past electrons, past the nucleus. If we make the intervals of this movement infinitely small, we’d move toward the center endlessly, just as we could move outward forever. The process of shrinking inward is as infinite as expanding outward. Try to wrap your mind around this infinity, whether stretching outward or diving inward—you can’t fully grasp it. Similarly, you can’t fully comprehend why the space of possibilities contains everything simultaneously, with an infinite number of potential manifestations of reality.



So, what does this give us? By choosing a life path, we essentially select a specific film reel to play in our projector. If a person drifts through life without managing it, the reel is chosen randomly—whatever comes up becomes their fate. If they’re content with a fate that feels predetermined, they’ll believe it’s set by someone or something and will feel powerless to change it. If they believe their current actions, good or bad, are shaped by past lives or karma, then that’s what they’ll get, as it’s their choice—they’ve selected that particular reel from the space of possibilities. But if you’re convinced you can choose the reel that suits you best with your will, then that’s what will happen. It’s simply the result of your choice.



The question arises: Why can there be an infinite number of possibilities, and why are they recorded? You all studied coordinate planes and function graphs in school. Imagine you’re a point on that plane, wondering how you can occupy any position on it. Take a parabola or hyperbola—who recorded that function on the plane? No one did—it simply exists, independent of mathematical theories. There are countless such graphs. A point might ask, “Who decided I should move along this trajectory? Why can’t I move along another? Why is it all recorded?” It just is—it exists without anyone recording it. Understanding this is as difficult as grasping infinity. If you tell a point that beyond the coordinate plane, there’s a three-dimensional or four-dimensional space, it might lose its mind. Similarly, we don’t need to ask where the space of possibilities is located. It could be in your coffee cup or far away in another dimension, or it might permeate the space we’re in. That’s not important. What matters is that we travel there every night when we sleep. A dream can be seen as the soul’s flight through the space of possibilities.



If we attribute consciousness to the mind and the subconscious to the soul, then when the mind relinquishes control, the soul, with direct access to the space of possibilities, can freely roam there. It randomly selects a film reel to play during sleep. The notion that dreams are merely a product of brain activity is a primitive misconception. In reality, the brain contains nothing—neurons have no direct connection to memory or thought processes. The brain only processes incoming information and perception. You don’t think with your brain. A person thinks and remembers through the morphogenic field surrounding them. Imagine a field shaped like your body, made of billions of tiny light bulbs that flicker on and off. When a bulb goes out, you forget something; when it lights up, you remember. These bulbs serve as addresses to the space of possibilities. Your morphogenic field pulses and glows, connecting you to this space, allowing you to recall, make discoveries, dream, or even glimpse the future. Phenomena like clairvoyance stem from this same nature—the soul can peek at future frames that may or may not manifest.



There’s no guarantee that a clairvoyant’s vision corresponds to the reel that will play in reality, just as there’s no guarantee that dreams reflect the reel that will manifest. So, interpreting dreams is largely a futile exercise. Who operates the projector? What force drives it? Who started it? Again, due to the limitations of our mind, we assume everything has a beginning and is set in motion by someone. Perhaps the projector has always been running—it has no beginning or end. It simply is, always has been, and always will be.



How can a person choose the reel for their projector? The choice is made through the power of thought, or more precisely, intention. Thoughts don’t vanish—they’re as material as any form of energy. A thought acts like a spotlight illuminating the frame currently playing in reality. You could say material reality is like a planet floating in this infinite metaphysical space of possibilities. That’s how movement from past to future occurs, yet the past and future never disappear—they always exist. Every person, like every being, is free to choose their reel if they wish.



How does this relate to God, the creation of the world, and so on? There’s a simple, straightforward answer: God as a singular entity doesn’t exist. God permeates everything—every living and non-living thing. The distinction between living and non-living is purely conceptual. God, penetrating all existence, governs the world. There’s a spark of God in each of us and in every grain of sand. What is our life? Our life is nothing but God’s dream. God is present in each of us, so His intentions align with ours. What is the intention of living beings? To manage reality to some degree, to live life as we see fit. We do this through actions in the material world and by managing reality with our thoughts. Every being, living or not, projects thought forms into the world. A grain of sand might project, “I am a grain of sand.” A person projects the image they’ve chosen: “I’m a failure,” “I’m successful,” “I’m poor,” “I’m rich,” “I’m healthy,” “I’m sick.” Whatever thought form you project, that’s the reality you’ll get.



Transurfing as a teaching explains how to choose your film reel, what you need to do, and how to direct your thoughts and actions. The eternal question—what is the meaning of life? Philosophers have wrestled with this for millennia, creating all sorts of theories. In reality, it’s much simpler: the meaning of life is life itself. We live to live, just as you could ask, “What’s the meaning of the universe?” It exists because it exists, and we exist because we do. The purpose of life is simple: to manage reality, to shape your life as you desire.



Think of a chick in a nest. How can it manage its life? Within its limited possibilities, it can’t. It depends on external circumstances. But when it leaves the nest and becomes independent, it can choose where to live, find food, and protect itself—in other words, manage its life. The goal is simple: managing reality. Most people don’t know how to do this. They think, based on conventional thinking, that to achieve something, you need to work hard, push through, fight for a place under the sun. In reality, there are more effective methods.



Imagine a kitten in front of a mirror. It doesn’t understand that it’s seeing its own reflection—it just paws at the mirror, trying to catch it. People do much the same. Your reality, your personal “layer” of the world, is shaped by the image you project. The world is a dual mirror: the material universe on one side, the space of possibilities on the other. Standing before this mirror with your thought form, you illuminate a corresponding frame from the space of possibilities. Thus, you become either poor or rich, successful or a failure.



Let me illustrate with an example—how I managed to write books that became global bestsellers. It all started when I hit a low point in my life. Everything I’d hoped for and worked toward collapsed. I was in a pit, and it seemed impossible to climb out. I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, at the breaking point of my life. Then, something like an initiation—what esotericists might call it—happened. Simply put, my mind was rewired. One day, I woke up with the word \*Transurfing\* spinning in my head. I had no idea where it came from or what had happened to me. All I felt was shock, as if I’d been struck—not physically, but mentally. Something in my psyche snapped.



After that, fragments of information began flooding into my mind spontaneously. They were disjointed but meaningful. Soon, I realized this information held immense power and practical value, capable of transforming a person’s life. I filled several notebooks with these fragments. I can’t explain how this information came to me—it just appeared, often at inconvenient times and places. I carried a notebook everywhere, jotting it down. My job at the time was chaotic—I was interrupted every 10-15 minutes to deal with various issues, running back and forth. Yet somehow, I managed to piece this mosaic of knowledge together into a system—a system for managing reality, for choosing the film reel for your projector.



I started applying Transurfing as I began writing the book. I didn’t fully understand the whole picture until the book was finished. It was called \*Transurfing of Reality\*. In the world of esotericism, it’s hard to surprise anyone—there’s already so much information out there. I wondered why I was doing this. Becoming an author is tough; the book market is brutal. There’s an unwritten rule among writers: “If you can avoid writing, don’t write.” Writing only makes sense if you’re creating a bestseller that people will read. Otherwise, why bother? Breaking through as an author is incredibly difficult. Editors receive 50-100 manuscripts a day, skimming them quickly and tossing most into the trash unless something catches their eye.



As a beginner, you face a harsh reality: you and your writing are often unwanted. Writing a story is one thing, but a book is an entirely different beast—orders of magnitude harder. Only a few earn decent royalties. So why bother? But I knew which reel I’d choose for my projector. From the start, I aimed for a bestseller.



I’ll have to speak some harsh truths now, because most people want to achieve resounding success in this life. But everyone knows only a few reach the top. How do they do it? The essence of managing reality is to constantly focus your attention on the film reel you want to play in your projector. You need to choose the frame—the end result, the picture of your goal achieved. Paint that picture in your mind and live with it constantly, virtually replaying it like a slide. Your thought form, projected into the mirror of the world, clearly tells the world which frame you want in your life. It’s a simple truth, but you must do it systematically. People usually don’t—they expect instant results, but reality is inert, like molasses.



Imagine standing in front of a mirror where the reflection develops slowly, like an old photograph in a chemical bath. You smile, raise your hand, but the reflection lags, showing a still figure. Reality responds to your thought form with a delay, sometimes a long one. This throws the mind off—it sees no immediate results and concludes, “This doesn’t work.” It believes you can only influence reality through direct action. But when I started writing, I visualized the end result: my book being wildly popular, published worldwide in different languages, Transurfing spreading like wildfire. I kept this thought in my mind constantly, knowing it was the only way to achieve my goal.



Secondly, while working, I projected the thought form: “I write powerfully, boldly, vividly, and uniquely. My books make a strong impression on readers. I’m a genius—brilliant ideas come to me. Everything I do, I do brilliantly.” Why be modest? If you’re going to order, order big, because you get what you ask for. I held both the end result and the belief that I was writing with talent in my mind simultaneously. Otherwise, nothing good would’ve come of it. As a physicist by education with a C in literature, I objectively had no business creating anything remarkable. But I firmly knew the Transurfing principle: the thought form you project is what you’ll get. I had the audacity to declare to the world that I was a genius—nothing less.



Reality began aligning with my thought form. Somehow, I started writing professionally, despite not being a professional, and with talent, despite having none. Some force guided me—I simply chose the right reel for my projector and knew my choice would manifest because my intention was God’s intention. As His child, how could I doubt it would come to pass?



The next challenge was finding a publisher. Authors typically approach this with hope, but I knew hope was useless in this harsh reality. Breaking through in the book market, especially in esotericism, is nearly impossible. I didn’t hope—I was determined. I sent proposals to 20 top publishers in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and, as expected, got silence in return. My proposals likely sank into editors’ trash bins. But this didn’t discourage me. The next Transurfing principle is that for the reflection in the mirror to move toward you, you must take the first step. You can’t just paw at the mirror like a kitten unaware of its own reflection. Waiting and hoping only reflects waiting and hoping. Knocking on publishers’ doors only reflects searching for a publisher.



So, I created a new thought form: “The publisher finds me.” I calmly projected this slide into the mirror of the world, unfazed by the silence from publishers. But I knew I had to take concrete steps, as the world is both material and metaphysical. I created an email newsletter, set up a website, and started sharing excerpts from my book. I explained that you can choose the reel for your projector, and whatever you choose will play. To do this, you must systematically project thought forms of the end result.



There’s another aspect to this reality: forces that hinder you from realizing your intentions and finding your path. These are consciousness parasites—energy-informational structures in the subtle world, which I call pendulums. They form when a group of people thinks in the same direction, united by a shared idea, like a TV series, a show, work, or a hobby. Mental energy doesn’t vanish—it creates these structures in the ocean of energy, which then develop independently and influence people.



For example, during a football match, those who can see the subtle world—rare individuals—observe a black orb hovering over the stadium. Rays extend from it to every fan and player. As the match intensifies, emotions surge, and energy flows to the orb, which grows. It doesn’t just absorb energy—it amplifies the emotional intensity to feed off more. By the match’s end, it swells into a massive black cloud before shrinking back into an orb and departing. Similar pendulums form during concerts or other events, feeding on people’s energy.



There’s nothing inherently wrong with this—people give some energy to the pendulum. But if a player scores an own goal, sparking outrage, the pendulum absorbs that energy, preventing it from overwhelming the player. Similarly, a celebrity receiving adoration gives much of that energy to the pendulum. The danger lies in pendulums provoking conflicts and negative emotions to maximize energy output, subtly manipulating consciousness.



Carl Jung, Freud’s student, boldly claimed that human motivations are largely driven by external forces, not internal ones. Transurfing asserts that scientists are mistaken in studying the psyche as an independent entity. The issue isn’t how the mind works but that it’s not free—it’s controlled externally by these consciousness parasites. You can see this in your own life: irritants seem to multiply—children misbehave, people pester you with problems, traffic jams appear when you’re in a hurry, or a queue forms at the door. If you yell at home, conflicts escalate at work. These subtle entities induce these situations, not with deliberate intent but like parasitic plants strangling a tree, restricting its growth.



You might think you’re in control of your emotions or actions, like during intimate moments. But often, it’s these entities influencing you. In an office, men and women act calmly, but in an intimate setting, a wild, almost primal energy emerges. This isn’t a second personality or ancient instincts—it’s an external entity temporarily taking hold. There’s no need to fear this—it’s just reality. During such moments, these entities exchange energies in the subtle world, and once the moment passes, you return to normal.



You can observe this by turning on your awareness. Notice when something external seems to “possess” you, driving irrational behavior. In extreme situations or crowds, people act unlike themselves, as if under a collective force. Why does a normal person turn brutal in war? Why did ordinary Germans commit atrocities during World War II? It wasn’t their nature—it was the influence of pendulums.



Pendulums follow two laws: First, they do everything to extract maximum energy, often negative, through conflicts, revolutions, or terrorism. These are battles between pendulums. Second, they strive to maintain the system’s stability, preventing its collapse. In a family, for instance, pendulums spark conflicts to feed on energy but also keep the family unit intact. This creates the paradox where frequent conflicts strengthen the family, as the saying goes, “Lovers quarrel, but they reconcile.”



This reveals a grim truth: humanity is under the influence of these subtle entities, much like in \*The Matrix\*. People aren’t free—they’re bound by these forces, which trap their will from the moment they’re born, placing them in a system’s cell. This is done through dependencies—food, alcohol, tobacco, and information. Internet addiction, for example, causes physical discomfort when people are disconnected, similar to drug withdrawal. These dependencies create a cycle of brief euphoria followed by a heavy price—energy drained by pendulums.



Even eating a simple hamburger involves a massive system—tractors, factories, and processing—all feeding pendulums. The energy you consume in synthetic food comes at a cost: sluggishness, heaviness, or worse. Natural foods, like a grandmother’s borscht, don’t involve pendulums and nourish without draining you. The fairy tale of Sinbad the Sailor illustrates this: travelers were fed delicious food until they became docile, fattened for slaughter. Today, nations obsessed with fast food and synthetic drinks face obesity, fatigue, and stress, subtly enslaved by pendulums.



To break free, you must step out of the system’s ranks and forge your own path. Stars in show business, sports, or science don’t fight for a spot in the front—they create their own “religion,” their own standard. The system then follows them. To resist pendulums, don’t fight them—you can’t win. Instead, stop emitting the energy they feed on. By calmly stepping out of the ranks, you become invisible to them.



The mind, shaped by society’s templates, drowns out the soul’s voice—your heart’s quiet whispers. To hear it, you must awaken from the unconscious dream most people live in. Practice awareness: observe your thoughts and feelings in everyday situations, like shopping. Notice when your mind rationalizes a purchase while your soul feels unease. This awareness lets you hear your heart, guiding you to your true path.



To find your purpose, expand your horizons. The mind can’t choose your path—only your soul can. Expose yourself to new experiences, and when your soul sings, you’ll know you’ve found it. Then, project the thought form of your goal achieved, living in that reality virtually. Ignore doubts about how it will happen—focus only on the end result. Reality will align, opening unexpected doors and opportunities, as countless readers have confirmed through their experiences.



For practical steps, try the “amalgam technique.” Like Venetian mirrors with gold in their reflective layer, you can create a mirror of your world that reflects warmth and care. Regularly affirm, “My world takes care of me, protects me, and chooses the best for me.” This habit transforms your reality, clearing away stress and negativity, making your world shine like a rainbow after rain.



Finally, water plays a crucial role. Tap water and most bottled water are “dead”—laden with toxins like chlorine and negative information from urban pipelines. Distilled or melted water, free of impurities, is ideal. Charge it with positive intentions, like health or beauty, by holding it between your palms and affirming your goals. This turns water into a powerful tool for manifesting your thought forms.",1,1754989710.0,realitytransurfing,1,1.0,False

However, I’m romantically inexperienced and have never been in a relationship with a guy or a girl since I never liked someone enough for a romantic commitment. 
I’m currently on a study exchange and will leave soon in a month. I met this girl in a class. I had this initial impression of her: friendly, bright straight girl with clean girl vibe. I thought we would really match as friends with similar style. Having talked with her, I gradually sensed sth was different from my impression about her. When she said her ex was also asian, I subtly asked”what country is that person(neutral form hehe) from?”, hoping to know her ex gender and therefore her orientation. My intuition was right when she said ‘SHE is chinese’. I was like woahh and sth(hope?)started to bud, tingle inside me.
I could not stop thinking about her after several months and I gotta admit I was interested in her(already imagine our future together). I went to the class again but did not see her. I went on dating app Her, hoping to forget about her by finding girls similar to her but couldn’t (dang I sound bad, isn’t it). Meeting her kinda makes me explore what types in girls I’m attracted to. 
Luckily, I got her WhatsApp and decided to muster up courage to ask her to hang out after several months of silence. She said yes and let’s grab some coffee.
Due to my lack of romantic experience, I want to know:
- how to know if this is a friend date or sth more like a real ‘date’.
- how to subtly ask if she is still single/available and know if she might be interested in me romantically and not just friendly and if a lesbian is already taken, will they easily say yes to a hang out w another girl?
- what should I converse to not make this date a dry one. I’m already a dry texter(how to improve this btw) and can talk better in person but I’m still very worried.
- any suggestions for activities for dates(especially in Munich, Germany)
- what gifts to give her, how should I dress. We’re kinda both chapstick vibes but she kinda leans more to a lil bit of masc and me to femme. 
- what is the right path and pace for a wlw relationship? Am i developing feelings too fast after only meeting once and talking for only 1h? I don’t want to miss my chance and regret it but I also don’t want to push it so fast and scare her off or make our relationships fall apart.

I have not written to you in a couple days.
Not because the words left me, but because they began to feel like trespass.
And I promised myself I would not step over your silence, no matter how loud the ache inside me becomes.

These past few days, the restraint has lived in my throat like fire.
I have wanted to reach for you.
Not to pull you back — I know I cannot do that.
But simply to know: Are you still in this world with me?
Still walking through your days with that steady grace,
still letting the sunlight touch your shoulders in ways I used to watch with quiet awe.

I wonder if you’re eating enough.
If your coffee still tastes like ritual.
If your laugh still rises like the tide and crashes down on someone who knows how lucky they are to hear it.
I pray to your name more than I speak it,
because I’ve learned the difference now
between wanting and honoring.
And I want nothing more than for you to be safe,
even if it is no longer my place to keep you so.

You have become the coordinates of my internal compass.
The north I reach for when I’m lost,
the south where my grief sleeps,
the east where memory rises,
and the west where I watch you set each night
behind the horizon of a world that no longer bends toward me.

If you only knew how much I’ve changed.
Not for you —
but because of what loving you taught me.
That love can be holy and devastating all at once.
That the deepest kind does not beg to be returned — it just is.
It waits without expectation.
It survives in silence.
It lives even when it cannot speak.
And I live with it now — this quiet devotion — like a second spine.

Some nights, I find myself whispering into the air like you might hear me.
I still whisper like you’re listening to me.
I whisper your name like it’s holy. Sacred. And I am still yours.
I whisper these hushed prayers to you as though you’re hearing me —
not because I believe you do,
but because I believe you once did.
And that’s enough to keep me soft.
Quiet as the stars, loud as the love inside my ribcage.

I miss you.
Not in a way that asks anything of you.
But in a way that humbles me.
That reminds me how rare it is to find something that reshapes the very way you walk through this life.
I miss you in a way the tides and stars miss the moon when it’s not around.

You were that for me.
My moon on my lonely nights. My sun on my cloudy days.
My north.
The north that still remembers, the morning star to guide me home.

And if the cost of knowing you — truly knowing you —
is to now love you from a distance you may never return from,
then I will bear it.
Still I stay. Always.
I will wait. Forever.

With reverence.
With aching grace.
And with a silence that will always make room for your voice should it ever find its way back to me.

Until then,
I will keep loving you the way the moon loves the tides —
from far away,
but always pulling.

This is my love at the speed of light, the speed of restraint,
the speed of holy —
a whisper to the stars and the moon,
so you might hear me when I say your name like prayer.

Yours, quietly and always,
Castor

While hunting for my “perfect” one, I stumbled on this **PHILIPS Digital Airfryer HD9252/90**, and honestly, if I hadn’t already set my heart (and wallet) on another model, this would have been *the* one sitting on my kitchen counter right now.

After so much research, I’ve decided to review **not just the one I bought**, but also the ones I didn’t ... and tell you exactly why. So, if you’re on the fence, stay tuned for the full series. Now, back to this one.

**Click here to check today’s deal before you regret it →** [**Buy on Amazon**](https://www.amazon.in/PHILIPS-Digital-HD9252-90-Technology/dp/B097RJ867P?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# Why This Caught My Eye

* **Touch Panel Controls** — I love when appliances don’t make you squint at knobs like it’s 1998. This one’s sleek, easy to wipe, and gives your kitchen that “modern cooking show” vibe.
* **4.1L Capacity** — Not too small, not too bulky. Perfect if you’re cooking for 2–4 people without hogging your countertop.
* **7 Preset Menus** — Fries, chicken, fish, even baking. It’s basically a mini smart oven without the insane preheat wait time.
* **RapidAir Technology** — That crispy-outside, soft-inside magic without drowning your food in oil. Philips claims up to **90% less fat**.
* **Extra 1-Year Warranty** — Philips is already reliable, but that extra year of warranty is a quiet little cherry on top.

# What’s Great

* **Super Easy Cleaning** — Non-stick basket and tray slide out, wash up quick, no drama.
* **Consistent Results** — No hot spots, no burnt patches — you get even cooking every time.
* **Compact but Spacious** — Takes up less space than you think, but can still roast a whole small chicken.
* **Energy Efficient** — Shorter cooking times, less power used than a traditional oven.

# Where It’s Not Perfect

* **No Rotisserie Option** — If you’re into that, you’ll need a different model.
* **4.1L Might Feel Small for Big Families** — Works best for small households.
* **Preset Menu Can Be Limiting** — Some folks like total manual control, so you might just ignore the presets.

# Final Thoughts

If I was starting from scratch, this **would** have been my pick. It has the right mix of features, capacity, and brand trust, all without crossing into “luxury appliance” pricing. For anyone who wants to upgrade their cooking game but doesn’t need a jumbo-sized fryer, this is a seriously solid choice.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal scalloped bowl combines aesthetics with functionality, offering durability, visual appeal, and versatility. Selecting the right bowl involves examining factors like material,size,design intricacy,and overall construction quality.

**Material and Durability:** Many Scalloped bowls are made from a variety of materials, including glass, ceramic, porcelain, and even metal.

Glass bowls offer a classic, timeless aesthetic and are typically dishwasher-safe. Ceramic and porcelain bowls provide greater durability and can often withstand higher temperatures, making them suitable for serving hot dishes. Metal bowls, particularly those made from stainless steel, are exceptionally durable and resistant to chipping or breaking, offering a modern, sleek look. The choice of material significantly affects the bowl's longevity and suitability for different uses. The type of glass used is also important.Tempered glass, as an example, can withstand dramatic temperature changes and is much stronger than normal glass.Porcelain can be quite durable if it is indeed manufactured at high temperatures.

**Size and Capacity:** Scalloped bowls come in various sizes, ranging from small, individual serving bowls to large platters suitable for family-style meals.

The size of the bowl determines its intended use. Smaller bowls, typically holding between 10 and 20 ounces, are ideal for serving dips, sauces, or individual portions of desserts. Medium-sized bowls, with a capacity of 30 to 60 ounces, are versatile and can be used for salads, side dishes, or appetizers. Larger bowls, exceeding 60 ounces, are best suited for serving main courses, large salads, or for decorative purposes. Careful consideration of the bowl's capacity ensures it meets your specific serving needs.

**Design and aesthetics:** The defining characteristic of a scalloped bowl is its decorative edge, which can range from subtle, gentle curves to elaborate, ornate designs.

The design of the scallops contributes significantly to the bowl's overall aesthetic appeal. Some bowls feature simple, uniform scallops, offering a classic, understated elegance. Others showcase more intricate designs, with varying scallop sizes, depths, and patterns, adding a touch of artistry and visual interest. The choice of design should complement your existing dinnerware and reflect your personal style. The scallop pattern also affects the bowl’s usability; deeper scallops can make it more difficult to scoop out food, while shallow scallops might potentially be purely decorative, and have minimum effect on the utility of the bowl.

**Stability and Base design:** A stable bowl is essential for preventing spills and ensuring safe handling.

The design of the bowl's base plays a crucial role in its stability. Bowls with a wide, flat base are generally more stable than those with a narrow, rounded base. Some bowls feature non-slip feet or a weighted base to further enhance stability, making them less likely to tip over, especially when filled with heavier contents. Additionally, consider the bowl's weight distribution.A well-balanced bowl is easier to carry and less prone to accidental spills.**Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ease of cleaning is a practical consideration, especially for bowls that are used frequently.

most glass and ceramic scalloped bowls are dishwasher-safe, simplifying the cleaning process. However, delicate or intricately designed bowls may require hand-washing to prevent damage. Consider the material's resistance to staining and scratching. Glass and porcelain are generally resistant to staining, while some types of ceramic may be more prone to absorbing colors and odors. Additionally, ensure that the bowl is free from any sharp edges or crevices that could trap food particles, making it difficult to clean thoroughly. Some bowls may have special cleaning instructions, so it is important to be aware of this.

**Versatility and Functionality:** A versatile scalloped bowl can be used for a variety of purposes, from serving food to displaying decorative items.

Consider the bowl's suitability for different types of food.Some bowls are specifically designed for serving salads, with a wide, shallow design that allows for easy tossing and serving. Others are better suited for soups or stews, with a deeper, more rounded shape. A versatile bowl can also be used for displaying fruits, vegetables, or decorative items, adding a touch of elegance to any room. Some bowls are even oven-safe, making them suitable for baking and serving dishes directly from the oven. Think about the broad range of possible use cases for it, whether it will be an everyday item or is used only for special celebrations.

# Best iPhone 15 Pro Case with Card Holder [2025]

The iPhone 15 Pro is a significant investment, adn protecting it while maintaining convenience is a top priority for many users. One of the most practical solutions is an iPhone 15 Pro case with a card holder. These cases combine protection against drops and scratches with the ability too carry essential cards like IDs,credit cards,and transportation passes. this review will explore the market's best options for 2025, highlighting features, benefits, and ideal users.

## Key Features Analysis

The best iPhone 15 Pro cases with card holders offer a blend of protection, functionality, and style. The following are some key features to consider when choosing the right case.

**Material and Construction:** Premium materials like polycarbonate, TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), and genuine leather are frequently used in high-quality cases. The blend influences both durability and aesthetics. For example,a polycarbonate shell provides robust protection against impacts,while a TPU inner layer adds shock absorption. The overall construction should feature precise cutouts for ports, buttons, and speakers, ensuring easy access and functionality. The cardholder section must be securely integrated into the case design without adding excessive bulk. Seams need to be reinforced to stop peeling or tearing, and materials that resist scratches and stains are preferred.

**Card Holder Capacity and Security:** The capacity of the card holder can vary, with most cases designed to hold between one and three cards.The security of the cards is crucial.Look for designs that incorporate features such as a secure snap closure, a tight-fitting sleeve, or RFID (radio-frequency identification) blocking technology. A well-designed card holder will keep cards securely in place, even during vigorous activity, and prevent them from falling out accidentally. RFID protection shields the cards from electronic theft.

**Protection and Drop Resistance:** A good iPhone 15 Pro case should provide adequate protection for the phone. cases with raised edges around the screen and camera offer added protection against scratches when the phone is placed face down or dropped. Corner bumpers and air cushion technology can absorb and disperse impact forces during a fall. The case should meet or exceed military drop-test standards (MIL-STD-810G or later), indicating it has been tested to withstand multiple drops from a specified height.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is crucial, the aesthetic appeal of the case is also important. Cases are available in a wide range of colors, materials, and finishes to match individual style preferences. Slim and minimalist designs are popular for users who want to maintain the phone’s sleek profile, while more rugged designs offer a bolder look. The card holder should be seamlessly integrated into the case design so that it doesn’t appear bulky or out of place. Textured surfaces can provide a better grip and prevent the phone from slipping out of your hand.

I have not written to you in a couple days.
Not because the words left me, but because they began to feel like trespass.
And I promised myself I would not step over your silence, no matter how loud the ache inside me becomes.

These past few days, the restraint has lived in my throat like fire.
I have wanted to reach for you.
Not to pull you back — I know I cannot do that.
But simply to know: Are you still in this world with me?
Still walking through your days with that steady grace,
still letting the sunlight touch your shoulders in ways I used to watch with quiet awe.

I wonder if you’re eating enough.
If your coffee still tastes like ritual.
If your laugh still rises like the tide and crashes down on someone who knows how lucky they are to hear it.
I pray to your name more than I speak it,
because I’ve learned the difference now
between wanting and honoring.
And I want nothing more than for you to be safe,
even if it is no longer my place to keep you so.

You have become the coordinates of my internal compass.
The north I reach for when I’m lost,
the south where my grief sleeps,
the east where memory rises,
and the west where I watch you set each night
behind the horizon of a world that no longer bends toward me.

If you only knew how much I’ve changed.
Not for you —
but because of what loving you taught me.
That love can be holy and devastating all at once.
That the deepest kind does not beg to be returned — it just is.
It waits without expectation.
It survives in silence.
It lives even when it cannot speak.
And I live with it now — this quiet devotion — like a second spine.

Some nights, I find myself whispering into the air like you might hear me.
I still whisper like you’re listening to me.
I whisper your name like it’s holy. Sacred. And I am still yours.
I whisper these hushed prayers to you as though you’re hearing me —
not because I believe you do,
but because I believe you once did.
And that’s enough to keep me soft.
Quiet as the stars, loud as the love inside my ribcage.

I miss you.
Not in a way that asks anything of you.
But in a way that humbles me.
That reminds me how rare it is to find something that reshapes the very way you walk through this life.
I miss you in a way the tides and stars miss the moon when it’s not around.

You were that for me.
My moon on my lonely nights. My sun on my cloudy days.
My north.
The north that still remembers, the morning star to guide me home.

And if the cost of knowing you — truly knowing you —
is to now love you from a distance you may never return from,
then I will bear it.
Still I stay. Always.
I will wait. Forever.

With reverence.
With aching grace.
And with a silence that will always make room for your voice should it ever find its way back to me.

Until then,
I will keep loving you the way the moon loves the tides —
from far away,
but always pulling.

This is my love at the speed of light, the speed of restraint,
the speed of holy —
a whisper to the stars and the moon,
so you might hear me when I say your name like prayer.

Yours, quietly and always,

1mo3lnl,https://i.redd.it/mdhhwjcqzjif1.jpeg,"Is anyone else tired of sterile, all-new-everything homes? Let's talk about ""The New Old"" for 2025.","Hey everyone,

I've been browsing this sub (and others like it) for a while, and I've noticed a real shift in what we seem to value in a living space. For years, the trend was to get everything brand new, perfectly matched, straight out of a catalog. It looked clean, sure, but also a little… soulless?

Lately, I've been thinking about this concept I'm calling ""[The New Old.](https://weandthecolor.com/the-new-old-how-sustainability-and-nostalgia-are-redefining-interior-design-in-2025/205160)"" It's this move towards homes that feel more layered, personal, and lived-in. It’s not about recreating your grandma's cluttered living room. It's about blending the best of the past with the clean lines of the present to create something that actually feels like you.

# So, what exactly is ""The New Old""?

Basically, it's a mix of two big ideas: **sustainability** and **nostalgia**.

* **It's mixing old and new on purpose.** Think about that solid wood mid-century dresser you found on Marketplace paired with your modern, comfy sofa. Or your sleek, minimalist desk setup being warmed up by a vintage lamp. The contrast is what makes it interesting. The old stuff brings character and history; the new stuff keeps it fresh and functional.
* **It’s about ditching ""fast furniture.""** We're all more aware of our environmental impact. ""The New Old"" is about consciously choosing pieces that will last. This means thrifting, upcycling, buying from local artisans, or investing in quality items instead of buying particleboard junk that will be on the curb in two years. Reclaimed wood, secondhand finds, and natural materials are your best friends here.
* **It's about emotional connection.** This is the nostalgia part. In a world that feels pretty chaotic, surrounding ourselves with things that have meaning is incredibly comforting. That weird painting your aunt gave you? The armchair your dad used to read in? These things tell your story. They make a house feel like a home, not just a display room.

# Why is this happening now?

I think we're all craving a bit more authenticity. We want our homes to be a refuge, a place that reflects our journey and values. Choosing a vintage piece over a mass-produced one is a small act of rebellion against the generic. It's also just smarter – older furniture is often better made and, let's be honest, way cheaper if you know where to look.

# How you can try it (without breaking the bank):

You don't need a huge budget to nail this look. It's actually the opposite.

* **Hit up Facebook Marketplace, estate sales, and thrift stores.** This is where the magic happens. Look for solid wood pieces, unique shapes, and things with a bit of history.
* **Start small.** You don't have to replace everything. Start with one ""statement"" vintage piece, like a coffee table, a mirror, or a cool accent chair.
* **Bring in nature.** Plants are the ultimate ""new old"" accessory. They're timeless, sustainable (they literally clean your air), and add life to any corner.
* **Tell YOUR story.** Frame old family photos, display souvenirs from trips, hang up art that you genuinely love. Stop worrying about whether it ""matches"" and start focusing on whether it's meaningful to you.

I'm really curious to hear what you all think. Is this something you're already doing? What's the best secondhand piece you've ever found for your home?

Let's see some pictures of your ""new old"" combos!

**The future of home design is ""The New Old."" It's about mixing vintage/thrifted items with modern pieces to create a unique, sustainable, and personal home. It's cheaper, better for the planet, and makes your space feel more authentic. What are your thoughts?**

It's a big drama in the community,"We own a small, 5 star family restaurant in quite a small town. We are very well known bc it is the only Polish restaurant in a town that has quite a big Polish community. They know us, and we know them. Small town things. Bc it's a family business, we run quite tight ship, we see and hear and report back to each other with everything. Anyway, recently a guy came in asking if we saw his wallet, cause he ""definitely left it here and nowhere else"". I said no, there 100% wasn't a wallet. He asked to see the camera footage—to which we admitted was fake.

My Mom happened to go out for a coffee with a friend (that he hadn't seen in MONTHS) the next day (divine intervention for real) and the friend started telling her all about this scammer, who not only didn't pay her, but wants ""reparation fees"" for the ""damage that she did"". She works in cleaning. She takes before and after photos, so she has hard proof that the guy is an asshole and will probably win the case. She showed my Mom a picture and ło and behold it's the same guy asking about the wallet!! It clicked he might have been asking about the cameras bc he wanted to know if they were real or not, bc he was planning something! We asked around other friends and they said the same, that he was a terrible person who did his best to take their money.

I was wondering about the extent of the damage he could do to us and what to look out for? I've already ordered cameras and we're gonna install them in the dining room literally tomorrow, but there's also a corridor with stairs leading to the bathroom that im worried about, with no cameras. I'll just say it's unavailable or something short term but long term we might get some cameras there too or something. Even so, what are some of the things he might try to do to try to sue us and swindle us? I'm a bit paranoid as this is our only source of income and we have high fees already to pay. Something like this could ruin us. I need to be prepared for every potential situation and know what exactly to look out for/how to protect ourselves.

\
Alt text: Professional business people collaborating in a corporate setting. company here, the answer surprised me. The legal environment had shifted. When I visited the Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT) in the Diplomatic Area, I saw stacks of paperwork—much of it from solo founders like myself. But is it really that straightforward in 2025? Below is a complete, experience-based walkthrough.\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: 2025 Scene\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. and Reuters. With GDP growth forecast at 4.2% into 2025, the kingdom remains the Gulf’s most pro-entrepreneur regulatory environment. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over 6,500 new commercial registrations in Q1 alone, a trend fueled by international founders and solo operators.\
Importantly, Bahrain’s business culture blends modern efficiency with deep-rooted traditions—majlis-style meetings are just as common as Zoom calls. While the UAE and Saudi Arabia set high bars for foreign investment, Bahrain offers even more flexibility on ownership, licensing, and capital requirements (see 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain).\
Ramadan brings unique business rhythms—shorter working hours, more networking over coffee—or gahwa—in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton or the conference halls at Seef Mall.\
\
Can a Single Person Form a WLL Company in Bahrain? (Short Answer)\
Yes—as of the 2025 regulatory update, a single individual can register and own a WLL (With Limited Liability) company in Bahrain. The process has never been more accessible for solo founders, including non-residents and foreign nationals.\
But, there are technicalities you must understand. WLLs (akin to LLCs elsewhere) used to require two or more shareholders. However, new MOICT guidelines (Circular 8/2025, effective 1 March 2025) allow a sole founder to establish a ""Single Person Company WLL"" (SPC-WLL), provided they comply with the latest Sijilat portal documentation and capital requirements.\
I once almost submitted a dual-shareholder application out of old habit, only to be redirected by an LMRA officer who’d already processed three successful single-person WLLs that morning!\
For founders—especially foreigners—this change slashes both bureaucracy and partner risk. See foreigner-friendly activities and 100% ownership for a full list of eligible business activities.\
\
Bahrain Business Entity Types: Key Differences\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.: Now available as a Single Person Company (SPC-WLL). Most flexible for SMEs and solo consultants.\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Structurally similar to the new SPC-WLL, with some differences in permitted activities.\
- BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Company): Suitable for larger ventures; requires multiple shareholders.\
- Branch Office: Extension of a foreign parent; no independent legal status.\
- Free Zone Company:** For export-driven businesses or tech startups; see Bahrain free zones.\
More entity details: Bahrain business type structures.\
My firm opinion: For most solo entrepreneurs or consultants, the new SPC-WLL model provides the fastest, safest, and most cost-effective entry route.\
Bahrain’s WLL vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia\
\
WLLs in Bahrain now allow 100% foreign and single-person ownership, even outside free zones—something that remains more restricted in the UAE mainland and Saudi.\
Business setup fees and renewal costs are significantly lower than in Dubai or Riyadh, especially if you know the right shortcuts (more on saving money soon).\
\
\
Formation Process: Step-by-Step with Insider Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation..\
- Reserve your trade name online; check eligibility for WLL or SPC-WLL.\
- Insider tip: Early mornings (8:00-10:00am, especially Tuesdays) see the shortest queues both online and at the MOICT desk in Seef Mall.\
Step 2: Prepare Documents\
\
Passport copy (and, if resident, CPR ID).\
Lease agreement for physical office (virtual offices are accepted for many activities as of June 2025).\
Business plan (brief for most activities).\
Bank reference letter.\
\
A personal aside: In 2023, I wasted two days chasing notarized office lease documents. Now, the Sijilat portal accepts unsigned draft leases for initial approval—saving at least 48 hours!\
Step 3: Apply Via Sijilat\
\
Upload all documents.\
Pay the registration fee (starting from BHD 65).\
Track application status daily; if it’s still “Under Review” after 3 days, call the MOICT hotline or—better (my pro tip)—visit the main counter in the Diplomatic Area just before closing (1:30pm), when staff are eager to clear the day’s queue.\
\
Step 4: Open Company Bank Account\
\
Major banks in Bahrain Bay (Bank ABC, BisB, Ahli United Bank) process SME accounts faster than those in Manama’s older business district.\
Time-saver: Book your account meeting for just after lunchtime, when bank queues thin out.\
\
Step 5: Finalize Labor Market Authority (LMRA) Steps & Receive CR\
\
Complete LMRA registration if you plan to hire staff.\
Receive your Commercial Registration (CR) within 5-10 business days.\
If you operate as a solo consultant, LMRA steps are minimal. Tamkeen offers free advisory sessions for first-time founders.\
\
Full process details: Bahrain company formation process and commercial registration in Bahrain.\
\
Insider shortcut: Always bring extra passport-size photos and keep soft copies (PDF + JPEG) of all scanned documents—MOICT requests unpredictable extra “copies” at least twice during CR processing.\
\
\
Costs & Budgeting for Solo WLL Setups\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.:\
- MOICT Application Fee: BHD 65–100 (approx. USD 170–265)\
- Trade Name Reservation: BHD 25–50\
- Office Lease (virtual): BHD 300–600/year in Seef, less in Juffair; physical offices start from BHD 1,200/year\
- Legal setup/attestation: BHD 70–250 (factor in additional notarization charges if you want to avoid future amendments)\
- Annual renewal: BHD 80–150\
- Bank capital requirements: minimum BHD 50** (for most solo WLLs, raised in March 2025 from BHD 20)\
Recommended budget: Set aside BHD 800–1,500 for complete registration, rent, and first-year fees for a virtual-office, no-staff SPC-WLL.\
\
Save money: Use a virtual office lease to cut overhead, and check out Bahrain company formation cost for the latest fees and discount offers from local providers.\
\
Common mistake: Budgeting for one year of licensing but forgetting to account for mandatory accounting and annual audits (see below for compliance).\
\
Compliance, Tax, and Accounting: 2025 Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. introduced a new VAT compliance notification service (March 2025). This makes it easier to avoid late filing fines.\
\
No corporate income tax on most business categories.\
VAT (10%) applies to many activities—register if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500.\
Must maintain books and annual returns even for zero activity.\
\
My strong advice? Use a specialist service for routine filings. Accounting and bookkeeping services in Bahrain can automate most compliance at low monthly rates. I once missed a VAT filing deadline (during Eid, offices closed early)—since then, I haven’t handled my own statutory filings.\
\
Navigating Challenges: Top Mistakes & How to Avoid Them\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation. before proceeding.\
* Underestimating the time needed for bank account opening.\
* Not preparing correct lease documentation. Virtual offices are allowed for many activities, but not all (especially in fintech, which may require approval from the EDB).\
* Skipping required annual compliance filings.\
* Misunderstanding local sponsorship requirements—unnecessary for most WLLs, but still required for some regulated activities (Local sponsorship in Bahrain).\
\
The first time I attended a majlis-style business meeting in Manama, I wore a navy suit—only to find everyone else dressed in relaxed national attire, shoes-off, enjoying traditional qahwa. That informal networking led to a faster CR approval. Relationships matter in Bahrain.\

Pro tip: Attend a Tamkeen SME clinic or pop by the EDB office in Bahrain Bay to get free guidance on minimizing paperwork. And always respect the local custom of receiving coffee with your right hand during meetings (trust me, details matter).\

2025 Regulatory Update: What Changed?\
Surprisingly, the most impactful 2025 change is Circular 8/2025, which officially allows full single-person ownership of WLLs—even for foreigners, with nearly all commercial activities included. Previously, only specific activities were SPC-eligible. Now, the majority of activities—including consultancy, trading, and IT—are open.\
Implementation date: 1 March 2025\
Practical implication: No more need for a local partner or nominee shareholder—cutting both risk and complexity. As a result, more foreign founders are bypassing UAE free zones in favor of Bahrain’s open mainland setup.\
Official policy link: Bahrain.com regulations.\
\
Unexpected Tangent: The Power of Ramadan Networking\
During the holy month, routines—and business practices—shift: government counters open earlier, but close by 2pm, while the best networking happens during iftar events. The Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Seef district hotels host free mixers. One year, I met a key government contact over a surprise majlis at the InterContinental who untangled a Sijilat portal issue for me in days.\
This story matters: building your Bahraini network—no matter how solo your company—remains the fastest way to save time, clarify regulatory roadblocks, and grow a local client base.\
\
Single-Owner WLLs: Advantages & Nuanced Drawbacks\
Pros:\
* 100% ownership—even for foreigners\
* No minimum share capital (for most activities)\
* Fastest registration process, especially when using the Sijilat portal and virtual offices\
* No need for a local partner or sponsor\
Cons:\
* Some regulated sectors (like banking or insurance) still require CBB approval or local partnership\
* Annual audit and VAT compliance—even for zero-staff startups\
* Certain activities (especially professional services) may require additional professional qualifications\
My advice? For most solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, and digital consultants, the SPC-WLL structure in Bahrain is the ideal balance of flexibility and protection.\

Keylink Bahrain: company formation and cost breakdown\
Tamkeen: Free business advisory for new founders\
MOICT Helpdesk: Seef Mall counter, for face-to-face troubleshooting\
Sijilat Portal: Official online CR registration\
Accounting Services: Automated compliance support\
\
My strongest recommendation: work with a service provider who has physical presence in Seef or Diplomatic Area to avoid paperwork delays. I recovered three lost days simply because my agent had a pre-existing relationship with the Sijilat processing team!\
\
FAQ: Solo WLLs in Bahrain\
1. Can a foreigner own 100% of a WLL (SPC-WLL) in Bahrain?\
Yes, as of March 2025, foreign nationals can own 100% of a WLL (SPC-WLL) across almost all business activities, without needing a local sponsor. More details: foreigner-friendly activities and 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain.\
2. How much does it cost to register a solo WLL company?\
Expect to pay around BHD 800–1,500 for full setup, including all government fees, lease, and basic compliance. Specific fee breakdown: Bahrain company formation cost.\
3. Do I need a physical office?\
No—for most activities, a virtual office lease is sufficient. However, certain sectors (like finance or regulated consultancy) require a physical presence. For office rules, see Bahrain company formation process.\
4. Can I open my company in a free zone for extra benefits?\
Yes—free zones offer tax incentives and 100% foreign ownership (also available on the mainland via WLL), but require a different licensing process. See Bahrain free zones.\
5. What are the annual compliance steps?\
\
Annual audit (mandatory since 2025)\
VAT registration (if turnover exceeds BHD 37,500)\
Annual CR renewal and MOICT filings\
Outsource these to accounting and bookkeeping services for peace of mind.\
\
\
Final Expert Word:\
Bahrain’s 2025 reforms have made solo entrepreneurship easier, faster, and safer than ever before. A single person—local or foreign—can now launch a WLL company and access the Gulf’s most founder-friendly market. Focus on preparing your documents, leveraging virtual offices, and building relationships in the Seef or Diplomatic Area. If you want to skip queues and sidestep the old paperwork maze, follow these steps and you’ll enjoy Bahrain’s uniquely open business landscape—one where tradition, modernity, and opportunity blend every day.\

1mo3ceh,https://i.redd.it/e5gxp3zdqjif1.jpeg,How to survive meetings after 30 mins (useful tips worked for me:)),"Hi guys, I was diagnosed as ADHD 2ys ago and it's getting worse as I have multi projects going and joggling between different meetings EVERY SINGLE DAY.

I always got easily distracted especially for meetings after 30 minutes (or 12). After trying different ways here are my ways to survive long meeting minutes and hours and hope it can be helpful to anyone just like me. 

**1. Give yourself a mini focus warm-up**

Before joining, close the extra tabs, silence notifications, and skim the agenda.

I also like to have 1 or 2 focus props on my desk — a good pen, a clean notebook, even a sticky note that says stay here as a reminder to my brain that we’re doing this now.



**2. Use captions for online calls**

In Google Meet or Zoom, turn on captions — it keeps me from zoning out, especially with multiple languages or accents.

When captions aren’t accurate enough, I use Granola for better live transcripts.



**3. For long in-person meetings, don’t rely on memory alone**

If the meeting involves a lot of decisions or action items, I record the important parts.

Lately I’ve been testing Flowtica, a pen that records and highlights the key points for me, so I can actually listen instead of frantically writing everything down. I can ask the app later in the notes if I need a specific number or takeaway.



**4. Move a little (without being the weird one)**

If you can, change your sitting position, stretch your shoulders, or just adjust your chair height, micro-movement wakes up your brain.

If the meeting is on video, sometimes I switch my view layout or adjust the window size — small visual changes help me reset attention.



**6. Keep water (or coffee) within reach**

Hydration helps more than you’d think. Even taking a sip becomes a mini pause that keeps your brain from slipping away completely.



**7. Mentally “checkpoint” the discussion**

Every 10–15 minutes, silently ask yourself: “What’s the main point right now?”

If you can’t answer, it’s a signal to bring your attention back.



**8. Give your brain a parking lot**

Keep a small sticky note for unrelated thoughts that pop up (“need to email X” / “idea for project Y”) so you don’t chase them mid-meeting — you’ll come back later.

I'm F26 and I have very little romantic experience. I've been on a few dates from a dating app that didn't go anywhere. I've never been kissed, had sex etc.

I've been kind of seeing/talking to this guy who seems interested and is honestly pretty great. I'm attracted to him, he makes me laugh, we have shared interests, he has a great job etc etc. He doesnt seem to be put off by my extreme awkwardness and maybe even finds it cute? I met him two years ago and we would chat briefly sometimes in person. I had a crush on him then and thought there might be a vibe but then convinced myself I was being delusional. I didn't see him again for about 18 months. 

Then I bumped into him a few months ago and he asked if i wanted to get coffee. He was flirting hard then. We've been on a coffee date(?) one other time. That one was also spontaneous after bumping into each other at a store. He seems to have backed off with the flirting a bit. Probably because I have no idea how to flirt so I guess I haven't been reciprocating and he maybe thinks I just want to be friends? I try to ask him about himself and laugh at his jokes and tease him and stuff but I have no clue where to go from there.

He invited me over to his place two nights ago and to my surprise I said yes. I'm not really sure if he expected something to happen or not. There were a few flirty comments from him and he reached over and touched my bracelet at one point. I was nervous and awkward as always. We just chatted and drank coffee and then I left. I'm scared that this is my one opportunity with someone that I actually like and that for some reason seems to like me back but I'm gonna fuck it up because of fear and my lack of experience.

1mo34qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1mo34qq/took_away_free_barista_coffee_vent/,Took away free barista coffee [vent],"I work at a ski field in New Zealand. For the first 2-3 weeks we were all allowed 1 free barista coffee. The upper management took away our free coffees. I recently spoke to one of the baristas and she thinks that upper management saw wastage and that’s why they announced no free coffee. However, the wastage is due to the fact that 1/2 of the coffee machines doesn’t pull espresso shots between 18/33 seconds consistently because a. it’s broken and b. it’s near a door that exposes it to cold temps/winds. The managers force the baristas to use the broken one once in a while because “they have to use both” and it results in ~100 espressos a day of wastage each time they use it. None of the employees care enough to revolt because it’s a minimum wage 5 month gig for a free lift pass. We still have free instant coffee. 

Not everyone is making minimum wage, there are maybe 1/3 of the food and bev team that are paid more, but I don’t know how much.

For some background info, I wake up at 6.50 am for the 7.15am departure bus almost every day and arrive at the ski field at 8.10am. We finish at 4.30pm but we always stay until 4.45 bus departure, and I get home at about 5.30pm. I know this isn’t the worst work/life ratio out there but still. 1.30hrs on a bus 5 days a week that we all have to get on and is not paid work.

Almost everything is frozen. All fruit and veg is fresh except for the frozen avocados in a bag that taste horrible and frozen peas. Frozen chips, burger patties, bread, burger buns, hash browns, chicken schnitzel, beef mince, pork/chicken bao buns. The point is, it’s sold at $7.50 for fries and 16.50 per burger. Minimum wage is $23.50. I came here because I was mostly unemployed for 5~ months. 

I know that they can afford to give us ~15 free coffees a day but also it’s a “luxury item” so whatever…? Is it normal to have free barista coffees? I think it hurts more because they took it away.

1mo34fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mo34fe/beyond_the_divorce/,Beyond the Divorce,"As night fell, I could finally relax after putting my daughter to bed. I grabbed my phone and mindlessly scrolled through the video app when a street fashion live broadcast caught my eye.

I straightened up and focused on the screen, but the host had already switched the camera angle. My heart pounded, and my hands started to feel clammy as I held my phone. I checked the time and confirmed it was a live broadcast happening in the same city.

Then I hurriedly exited the app and video-called my husband, Matthew Murphy.

He was supposed to be on a three-day business trip in Canta, yet I just saw him on the live broadcast with another woman in his arms. The phone rang for a long while before he finally answered the call.

Matthew’s camera shook slightly, and his handsome face appeared on my phone’s screen. He greeted me warmly, “Hey, honey!”

""Where are you?"" I asked urgently as my eyes scanned the footage from his end. He looked like he was in a corridor of a restaurant, and he was wearing a white shirt and tie. However, the figure I saw in the live broadcast wore a gray windbreaker.

""I'm having dinner with a client. I came out to answer your call. What's up? Is there something wrong? Is Ava asleep?"" He asked.

""Are you in Canta?"" I sidestepped his question and asked again.

""Of course I am. Why? Is something wrong?"" He looked at me seriously through the camera, full of curiosity.

""Oh! It's...nothing!"" I mumbled absent-mindedly, then asked, ""When are you coming home?""

""Soon... I'll be back once I wrap things up here. Do you miss me?"" Matthew smiled affectionately at me, full of love. ""I'll try to come home as soon as possible. It's getting late. Go to bed early, okay? I still have things to attend to. Bye!""

He blew a kiss to me and then hung up the call.

I held my phone, stunned and annoyed at myself for being suspicious. Matthew was an extraordinary, handsome, and doting husband, even though he was just a pauper when we first met.

Although he was from an ordinary family with a sickly younger sister from the city, I chose him among my many admirers because of his looks.

After graduation, I used my parents’ house as collateral to start a supply company with him and stayed by his side. Matthew was responsible for sourcing while I tirelessly handled with clients to the point I almost suffered from gastric bleeding. Fortunately, the company grew and began thriving.

When I was expecting, I decided to stop and entrusted the company to my husband while I focused on raising our child and managing our home.

Ava, our daughter, had turned four. We led a comfortable and well-off life as a family of three, which people were envious of.

Matthew felt so guilty that we didn’t have a wedding ceremony that he promised to provide for me and make up for any grievances I suffered.

How could such a husband cheat?

I pursed my mouth and smiled, realizing I had watched too many TV shows that evoked such ridiculous thoughts. When I laid back in bed, I still thought about the fleeting figure on the live broadcast.

I must have been thinking about Matthew too much. Also, the windbreaker looked familiar as it was the one I had ironed for him before his business trip. That meant the man in the live stream wore the same one, which confused me.

Matthew returned early the following day and brought many delicious treats for Ava. He hugged us both affectionately, creating a heartwarming atmosphere. I rushed to the kitchen happily to prepare several of his favorite dishes as a reward.

Matthew glanced at me as we sat to eat and casually said, ""There's a strong smell of oil here. Why don't you go take a shower?""

I calmly sniffed, then smiled proudly, saying, ""That's the smell of good food. Don’t you like the smell of food?""

He chuckled as he lovingly ruffled my hair. Then he stuffed some food into my mouth and gave Ava a piece too. ""All right, my sweethearts. Let's all eat!""

After dinner, I quickly put Ava to bed and then showered. I inched closer to Matthew and flirtatiously asked, ""Do I still smell like oil?""

Matthew smiled and affectionately pinched me. ""I've missed you so much, sweetheart!""

He pulled me toward the bed right away without giving me a chance to respond. Also, he seemed particularly enthusiastic today.

When we finished, I smiled and watched his tall figure approach the bathroom. As I was about to clean up, his phone on the bedside table flashed, indicating he had received a WhatsApp message.

I glanced at it and froze.

Chapter 2 A Substantial Amount of Information

I was about to pick up the phone to see who the sender was when Matthew hurried into the room and took the phone. He glanced at it hastily, then looked back at me.

""It's Mel!""

""What's the matter? Are you afraid that I'll find something?"" I looked at him suspiciously and felt uneasy as if something was wrong.

The message had only four words. ""Did she find out?""

It was enough for me because it implied the other person feared I’d find out about something. The message also showed a hint of ambiguity, so I scrutinized Matthew. My gut feeling surged as my premonition grew heavier.

Matthew chuckled casually and threw the phone back on the bedside table. Then he pulled me into his arms and kissed my face, saying, “You’re overthinking! It’s not about you, but my sister, Mel. She’s using me as a cover to scam Mom for money.”

Mel was Matthew’s younger sister, Melanie Murphy. She had been weak and sickly since childhood, so her family always pampered and spoiled her. She also behaved like a rich brat.

Melanie was in her twenties but never took anything seriously. She didn’t even go to school and only traveled, ate, and had fun.

“You’re trying to scam your mother for money? Where do you think her money comes from?” I snapped.

Matthew smiled, bent down, and lifted me in his arms. Then he nibbled on my earlobe as he approached the bathroom. “Yeah, yeah, it’s all your money. That’s what happens when I marry an amazing and understanding woman like you.”

I appreciated his words.

Throughout the years, I had never been stingy regarding his family because I believed a harmonious family led to success in all endeavors. I also believed in treating others with the same kindness I received.

Our second round in the shower washed away my doubts and grievances. It made me happy and content as I lay in Matthew’s arms.

That night, I brought up purchasing a house in a good school district again, which had become a pressing matter for me. We had lived in this small 500-square-foot apartment since we got married. The size didn’t bother me, but I didn’t want Ava to have a disadvantaged start.

She was about to start school, but the neighborhood had no good ones nearby. Although we had saved money for a new house over the years, Matthew always said there was no rush.

He wanted to find the best location in the fast-developing city so we wouldn’t need to keep moving.

This time, he didn’t argue when I brought it up again. Instead, he patted my shoulder, kissed my forehead, and said, “Okay, I’ll look for a suitable place for you to see, and then you can decide.”

His response pleased me, and I fell asleep sweetly, daydreaming about a beautiful big house.

Just after dropping Ava off at the kindergarten the following day, I received a call from my best friend, Irvanna, saying she wanted to meet at our usual spot.

Of course, I immediately responded and took a cab to the location.

Ivanna and I were close, just like sisters. We could talk about anything, but it was rare for her to call me. After all, she was a busy woman who worked as a talent manager in a media company.

When I entered our favorite dessert shop, I saw her sitting in the corner, typing away on her laptop. The morning sun cast a peaceful glow on her, making her look even more beautiful.

She waved at me as I approached, and I sat down before playfully asking, “Why are you so free today? You even had time to ask me out so early in the morning.”

Ivanna rolled her eyes at me and replied, ""Can't I be concerned about you?""

""Haha, sure you can!"" I sat down and sipped the coffee she had ordered for me. ""But aren't you always busy while I'm always free?""

""Ha! Aren’t you ashamed of that? Now, all I see is Matthew spoiling you. Don't say I didn't warn you, but don't get too comfortable. It's easy to become a fool!"" Ivanna said, looking at me intently.

For some reason, her words made my heart pound. I looked at her and casually asked, ""What do you mean? There's more to your words, isn't there?""

She lowered her gaze, looking at the computer screen, seemingly trying to hide something. ""Oh, nothing! I'm just teasing you a little.""

After some thought, she looked at me and said, ""I saw Matthew the day before yesterday.""

Chapter 3 Anxiety

""Two days ago? Where?"" I asked, feeling a little anxious.

Ivanna noticed my reaction and retorted, ""What’s with that look?""

""Where did you see him?"" I couldn't care less about bantering with her and continued pressing for answers.

However, Ivanna's phone started ringing. She glanced at the screen and hushed me before leaning into her chair and answering the call. After a few sentences, she straightened up, glanced at me, and said, ""What?! I'll be right there!""

Immediately after, she closed her laptop and stuffed it into her bag. ""I have to go. Let's meet up again another time!""

""Wait... You..."" I had more questions, but she ignored me and left.

She said she saw Matthew two days ago, but he was supposed to be on his business trip in Canta then. Where did she see him? Was she at Canta for a trip as well?

I shrunk back into the seat silently. I was helpless, but a strange sense of fear filled my heart. The video kept playing in my mind, but I wasn’t sure if it was Matthew.

Was he lying to me? Did he not go to Canta at all? Is he having an affair?

I sat alone in the cafe with my mind in turmoil. Despite the warm sunlight shining on me, I couldn't stop shivering. I wondered what I should do if Matthew had an affair and what would happen to Ava.

I was so absent-minded the whole day that I forgot to pick Ava up. Fortunately, Matthew returned early today. Seeing that I had forgotten to pick Ava up, he quickly comforted me and left for kindergarten.

Once he left, I forced myself to get up and started cooking. Before Matthew returned with our daughter, Melanie walked in unexpectedly. She had a key to our place and treated it as her own home.

Although I disliked this, Matthew indulged her. When she saw me in the kitchen, she put down her bag and came over. She leaned against the door and asked, “Why are you cooking? Where’s my brother?”

I was washing the vegetables as I replied, ""He went to pick Ava up.""

“It’s already late, and he’s only going to pick her up now?” Melanie’s tone carried a hint of reproach. She always acted pampered and arrogant, as if she was the boss of the house.

Her attitude toward me, her sister-in-law, was also unpredictable. However, I had grown accustomed to her behavior over the years. After all, she was Matthew's sister, and I had no choice but to accept the good and bad of marrying him.

""Do we have squid at home? I want some calamari!"" She asked casually.

I gestured toward the fridge. ""Look in there. Your brother probably bought some.""

Just then, Ava's tender voice echoed from the doorway. ""Mommy, I'm back! Why did you forget to pick me up today?"" She ran up to me, looking at me with her head tilted.

Although I felt guilty, I smiled and pinched her nose with my wet hands. ""I was busy. I promise I won't forget my baby next time.""

Matthew came in with our daughter's little backpack and looked at us dotingly. Meanwhile, Melanie approached the doorway and greeted him, ""Matt!""

""Why are you here?"" Matthew asked as he put down his things and removed his coat. Then he entered the kitchen and wrapped his arms around me. The next second, he removed my apron and put it on himself. ""I got this, honey. You can go play with Ava.""

Melanie stared at her brother and sarcastically remarked, ""My brother is such a good husband. I want to find someone like him in the future!""

Matthew snapped, ""Leave the kitchen and stop causing trouble. Just wait for the meal to be ready.""

""I don't want to. I'll help you!"" Melanie spoke playfully, then squeezed into the kitchen. ""I want to experience being a supportive wife!""

I sighed at her words and thought she was shameless. How could she dream about finding someone like her brother when she was just a good-for-nothing who lazed around all day? It’d be a curse for whoever married her.

I was already annoyed, but seeing Melanie amplified it. She was a grown woman who constantly pestered her brother. I knew she was only ingratiating herself with Matthew to ask for money again.

The Murphys had lived in poor conditions in their earlier years. Matthew’s parents worked odd jobs everywhere, while Melanie often fell sick and needed tentative care. Life was challenging for them back then, and Matthew felt helpless.

However, Matthew and his family’s lives changed drastically when my company kicked off. In a way, Matthew and I supported a big family, especially Melanie.

She always asked for money as if we were supposed to give it to her. She was practically a parasite yet unapologetic and still dared to be carefree. I was genuinely speechless.

I took my daughter's hand and left the kitchen. If Melanie was out of sight, she was out of mind. Just then, my phone rang, and when I looked, it was Ivanna.

Chapter 4 The Truth Hurts

I hurried back to the bedroom and answered the call to complain, ""You're something else, huh? You left me hanging!""

""Something came up at work, so I was in a rush."" Ivanna sounded tired. ""I just finished settling it. That's why I'm calling you now. Why are you complaining? Do you think my life is as easy as yours?""

I hesitated to reply but couldn't hold back and asked her, ""Um, you mentioned seeing Matthew two days ago. Where was he? What time was it?""

This question had been bugging me all day.

Ivanna paused on the other end before she answered calmly, ""Honestly, I forgot the exact location. It was just a fleeting glimpse while I was driving.""

""Oh."" For some reason, her answer left me a bit disappointed. Although my heart dropped, I unclenched my fists and realized my palms were cold and sweaty. I chuckled and wondered whether or not I wanted to prove Matthew was having an affair.

I must admit he was my everything, and I feared losing him.

""I realize how obsessed you are with your husband. You seem to light up whenever I mention Matthew. Can't you prioritize yourself more? Since Ava is already in kindergarten, you should do something for yourself.

""Don't tell me you plan on being Matthew's accessory for the rest of your life. I think you're becoming a fool. You seem completely disconnected from the outside world because Matthew is the only person in yours,"" Ivanna mocked me.

I smiled awkwardly and sighed. ""Matthew said...""

""See?! Matthew said this, Matthew said that. Was I wrong to say you’re obsessed with him? Your life revolves around him, and whatever he says goes. Will you jump off a cliff if he says so? Will you count the money for him if he betrays you for money?"" Ivanna didn’t hold back.

""Ugh, you're such a jinx! Matthew will never do that to me!"" I retorted.

""Yeah, you're right. Your beloved Matthew will never do that, but I will!"" Ivanna sneered disdainfully. ""The truth hurts sometimes, but you must have values. Your life shouldn't revolve around being a housewife and doing chores. That's not love. That's being a fool!

""It's only love if he cares about you. How can you keep his interest if all you do is stay home and do chores? Let me ask you something. Besides your child and husband, do you even know who you are anymore?""

Ivana babbled, and I had no time to refute.

She noticed my silence and softened her tone. ""Chloe, I want to see your confident and radiant self again. You used to be a top student, my superstar! I just think it's a shame to see you wasting your time, slaving away at home like this.""

""Enough. This is like giving me a pat on the back after slapping me. I don't know who got on your nerves, but you've decided to vent it on me.""

We both laughed when I said that.

Still, I knew Ivanna always spoke her mind. Although she had mentioned similar things before, hearing them again today felt different. I didn’t know why I felt flustered and wondered if Ivanna was trying to imply something.

Just then, Matthew knocked on the door and walked in with a gentle smile. ""Honey, it's time to eat!""

Ivanna heard his voice from the other end of the call and said, ""All right, go have your dinner."" Then she lowered her voice and advised, ""Consider what I said. Take my words to heart, and don't get blinded by the shining things before you!""

With that, she hung up.

Matthew pulled me into his arms and kissed me. ""Who was it?""

""Ivanna.""

""What did she say? Was she nagging again?"" Matthew smiled tenderly, seemingly casual. He knew how close Ivanna and I were because three of us were former classmates. ""I haven't seen her in a long while.""

My mind began to spin. Matthew said he hadn't seen her in a while, so Ivanna was far away when she saw him. I felt relieved and knew I was overthinking.

""What's wrong?"" Matthew noticed my absent-mindedness and leaned down to look at me. He pinched my cheeks playfully with both hands and leaned in for a kiss, showing utmost concern.

Then he asked, ""What's distracting you? What are you thinking about?""

His gaze was careful, and I snapped out of my thoughts. I smiled and said, ""Nothing. Let's eat!""

Matthew pulled me close and kissed me again before we walked outside together. Even so, my doubts somehow grew heavier.

Chapter 5 Strong Evidence

Melanie didn't stay long after dinner. She pouted at Matthew and asked, ""Matt, can you give me a ride?""

I rolled my eyes at her and glanced her way, but she feigned ignorance as she clung to Matthew's arm, acting like a spoiled brat.

Matthew looked at me with a helpless smile, but since I didn’t respond, he awkwardly said, “Wait a while. I’ll help Chloe with the dishes and then take you out.”

I was honestly sick of Melanie's behavior and didn't want to see her for another minute, so I waved Matthew away. ""You go ahead and take her where she wants to go. I can handle the dishes myself.""

""Daddy, where are you going? I want to go too!"" Ava called out, standing up from her chair as she extended her little hands for Matthew to pick her up.

Matthew lifted Ava and pecked her cheek, saying, ""Daddy will be home soon! Be good and play with Mommy, okay?""

""What's the point of you coming along, kid?"" Melanie questioned. She had no patience for Ava.

I took Ava from Matthew. ""Sweetheart, Daddy is sending your aunt off and will be home soon. Can you stay here with Mommy?""

Ava looked at me with her big, watery eyes before nodding. Then she hugged my neck and turned to look at Matthew. ""Okay! Come home quickly, Daddy!""

Matthew leaned in to kiss Ava again and nodded. ""Okay!""

He then took the car keys and left to drop Melanie off.

Melanie held onto her brother's arm, glancing back at me with a smug and mysterious smile, but I couldn't be bothered.

Matthew returned late that night, but I didn't ask much. Since he was a dutiful son, I assumed he chatted with his parents before coming home.

He woke up early the following day and said he had an important meeting at nine in the morning. He also took Ava with him and dropped her off at kindergarten to save me the trouble.

Matthew was always considerate about every detail, leaving me nothing to complain about. It was just as Ivanna said. He had spoiled me so much that I grew accustomed to it. He was the ideal husband, even to others.

I looked at the clothes he had changed out of and tidied them up since the laundry was piling up. I checked the pockets before taking them downstairs to send them off to the dry cleaner. Still, I didn’t expect to find something in one of the pockets.

I was shocked and horrified by what I held. It provided undeniable evidence for all my doubts and worries. It was a packaged private thing.

After giving birth to Ava, I had an IUD inserted, so we had no reason to have such a thing. I threw the disgusting thing away, and my heart shattered. I knew he was cheating on me! After years of hard work and struggles, he betrayed my trust.

Just as we finally enjoyed some good days, he dared to lie to me. I felt helpless as I knelt on the floor and held my head. Images of him and another woman swirled in my mind, adding to my heartache.

I had given him all my youth and love. I had given everything to him and this family, yet he treated me like dirt. After my initial shock, I mumbled to myself repeatedly, ""Chloe, calm down. You can't afford to lose everything you've worked so hard for.""

I needed to give myself a clear and definitive answer. Once I recollected my emotions, I clenched my fists and told myself not to give up. After taking a deep breath, I washed up and took a cab to the company building.

Chapter 6 Another Mrs. Murphy

I had only visited Tanum Corporation once when they first relocated to Galar Tower. Matthew took me there, and we rented an entire floor, which gave me a sense of accomplishment.

That day, he held me as we stood by the floor-to-ceiling window in his office and said affectionately, ""Thank you for helping me and changing my life. Believe me, my love. It won't be long before I give this building to you.""

I chuckled at his words. Now, he was about to tear it all apart.

When I entered the building, the young and attractive receptionist asked me which floor I was going to and who I was looking for. When I mentioned Matthew's name, she gave me a quick once-over and said with a smile, ""I'm sorry, madam. Mr. Murphy is not in. He went out with his wife.""

My head buzzed when I heard that. Although I had mentally prepared myself for it, her answer still shocked me. I tightened my grip around my handbag, but my voice turned somewhat sharp despite my efforts to control my emotions. ""What did you say? Are you sure?""

She looked at me in puzzlement and replied, ""Why, yes. You asked for Mr. Matthew Murphy of Tanum Corporation from the 10th floor, right? He left early this morning with his wife.""

Her certainty sent shivers down my spine. I felt tempted to ask who Matthew’s wife was. If another woman was his wife, who am I?

However, I held myself back and clenched my teeth. Then I turned and left Galar Tower. I wanted to leave with dignity and hoped the receptionist had made a mistake. That way, Matthew's pride would be intact as well.

Ultimately, I called Johnson Link from Tanum Corporation's marketing department to reconfirm what I just heard. My hands shook, but I calmed myself before asking, ""Hey, John, is Matthew done with his meeting? I've been trying to call him, but he's not picking up. I'm starting to get a little worried.""

Johnson was one of the high-ranking executives at Tanum Corporation, so he would know if there was a meeting. Upon hearing my question, he seemed a little puzzled. ""Meeting? There's no meeting today, Mrs. Murphy. Mr. Murphy is out.""

""Oh,"" was all I managed to say before hanging up.

At that moment, a sense of powerlessness washed over me. My tense nerves collapsed, and I felt my knees buckle. It was like all my energy had dissipated, leaving me drained. My hand that held the phone shook uncontrollably.

I couldn't even muster the courage to call Matthew and ask where he was. Was there even a need to ask? Even if I did, he would just lie to me again. I no longer knew how to trust anything he would say.

He shamelessly paraded around Galar Tower with another woman, making everyone believe the other woman was his wife. That woman could freely enter and exit, step into the company I had built independently, and enjoy privileges that should have been mine.

I felt lost as I stood on the street among the crowd, and he was nowhere in sight. He resembled sand, slipping through my fingers. The more I tried to grasp him, the faster he slipped away.

After thinking things through, I found out who this ""Mrs. Murphy"" really was.

With that idea in mind, I gathered the strength to move my trembling legs and hailed a cab. Once I reached home, I went to the nearby market and bought many of Matthew’s favorite dishes. I even picked out some pineapples that Ava loved.

I was going to wait for him to come home.

As I busied myself with chores, I thought about my next step.

I always thought time passed too quickly, but this time was different as it seemed to drag on endlessly. When evening arrived, I gathered my courage to call Matthew and ask where he was before telling him to pick Ava up.

He readily agreed.

Chapter 7 Looking for Evidence

I had almost finished preparing the food when Matthew returned with our daughter. Ava ran in, exclaiming in her sweet and childish voice, “Mommy, I’m back! Daddy picked me up!”

Her adorable voice brought tears to my eyes, but I suppressed my emotions. ""I got you some pineapples. They’re your favorite, right?""

""Oh! Mommy, you're the best! I can’t wait to eat them"" She ran out and headed to Matthew, saying, ""Daddy, I want to eat pineapples!""

""You can have a small piece for now. You can have more after dinner, okay?"" Matthew washed his hands and took a small piece to hand to our eager little girl. Then he squeezed into the tiny kitchen and hugged me from behind. ""Why did you make so much food?""

I felt terrible because this once-happy family of three was now on the verge of collapsing.

""You just came back from a business trip. You must be tired."" I forced a smile and asked, ""Were you busy today?""

He hummed a reply, and my heart immediately sank. I playfully nudged him with my elbow. ""Set the table and get ready for dinner.""

His intimate attempts made me sick. I wondered if he thought of the other woman whenever he held me. When I finished cooking, I smiled and asked, “Do you want a drink? It’s been a while, and I want a glass of wine.”

Mathew looked at me questioningly. ""Why do you suddenly want to drink?""

""No reason. Are you still going out?"" I asked as I turned to get the wine. ""Since I made so many dishes, we need to celebrate.""

I felt my heart shattering into a million pieces as I spoke. I knew Matthew couldn't handle wine well, so I poured him a little to avoid arousing suspicion. Then I poured myself half a glass and toasted with him.

Once we started drinking, we became excited and talkative. I pretended to be in high spirits as I reminisced about our college days, starting the business, and our current life. I seemed so happy.

Matthew noticed how cheerful I was and poured himself another glass of wine while reminding me not to drink too much. Ultimately, he drank more than he could handle. He was drunk when I helped him onto the bed.

Afterward, I washed up and put Ava to bed before beginning my mission. My heart was pounding as it was my first time looking through his things in so many years. I finally realized how innocent I was to trust him.

I searched through his pockets and bag but found nothing valuable.

Finally, I found his phone, but it had a fingerprint lock. I quietly approached him, trying to grab his hand, but he suddenly turned and caught me, staring at me with unfocused eyes. My heart was about to jump out of my chest.

""I need water,"" he slurred at me.

I ran out to pour him a glass of water and fed it to him. Then he collapsed back onto the bed, fast asleep. I unlocked and looked through his phone but found no suspicious names in the call history. I recognized most of them, and it seemed like very few were female, so I ruled them out.

Then I checked his WhatsApp only to realize he hadn't been messaging many people. I opened the conversation of the first contact and saw the message from the day he returned.

""Did she find out?""

It was just those four words with no additional information. It didn't seem like Matthew hadn’t deleted anything, either. I clicked on the woman’s profile picture and wanted to see her posts, but there were none.

I couldn't find any clues about who the sender was. It seemed like this person was cautious. Matthew told me it was Melanie, but I needed to verify it.

His photo albums included pictures of Ava and me and two of Melanie. Besides that, his phone was clean. I even scanned the phone with an app, but nothing suspicious was there too. I tossed and turned that night, wondering how there could be no traces.

I figured the woman wasn't someone from the company or the building. Otherwise, the receptionist wouldn't have called her ""Mrs. Murphy.""

I wondered who that other woman was or if I’d ever interacted with her.

Chapter 8 Unexpected Company

I forced myself out of bed the following day. The dark circles around my eyes were horrible, and Matthew noticed them. He asked in surprise, “

Matthew saw my haggard face and asked in surprise, ""Are you sick, Coco? Why do you look so pale?""

""You kept me up all night,"" I retorted, not in the mood for pleasantries.

He was stunned but hugged me with a shy grin. ""No more drinking for you. Exercise is better instead since it helps with sleep.""

I didn't know why, but my stomach churned when I heard his words. I rushed to the bathroom, vomiting and crying.

Every day:

* “DM me for crypto tips”
* Fake giveaways
* Tag spam with 30 random names

Some mornings I’d wake up to 20+ of these. Deleting them felt like bailing water out of a sinking boat with a coffee cup.

Here’s what I tried (and why it sucked):

* **Deleting manually** → waste of time
* **Blocking accounts** → most are one-and-done bots, so it changes nothing
* **Facebook’s keyword filter** → works for obvious stuff, but spammers use weird symbols, fonts, and misspellings to get through

What finally worked for me was stacking a few things together:

1. **Massive keyword/symbol list** → not just “crypto” and “WhatsApp,” but 100+ variations, misspellings, scammy emojis, URL shorteners
2. **Hide instead of delete** → spammers think it’s still up, so they don’t immediately try again
3. **Ask followers for help** → I literally told my audience “tag me if you see BS”
4. **Automation to catch it instantly** → if a comment matches my rules, it’s hidden before most people ever see it

It’s been about 3 weeks since I set this up. Spam is down probably 90%+, and the ones that slip through get nuked fast.

Lesson learned: you’ll never get rid of 100% of spam, but you *can* make your page such a pain in the ass for spammers that they go somewhere else.

Maybe it's because I've been reading some pop-psych stuff, but I wonder if personal space is more of a cultural thing than I realized. Could it be that we're all just conditioned to follow these ivnisible lines depending on who we're interacting with? It makes me curious about what variations exist across different cultures or even situations. Like, why is it okay to be super cozy at a concert, but awkwarldy distannt at a grocery store?

Idk, I guess I'm tryying to figure out if there's a psychological asspect to this. Maybe it's like a subconscious thing where we gauge someone's vibe and adjust our bubble accordingly?

Chapter 1 I was twenty-nine the year I broke up with the man I’d dated for four years.

He was steady and dependable but I broke up with him anyway.

And just like that, I agreed to my family’s arranged blind date.

My best friend Penney Green scolded me for being dramatic.

“He doesn’t treat you well? Really? He always knows how to take care of you.”

I was chewing on an apple, my voice muffled.

“But being with him is more exhausting than going to work.”

Just then, footsteps came from the entryway.

He was holding the breakfast he had gone out to buy for me.

“So being with me is that unbearable for you?”

# ...[https://writers.abbtech4u.com/all-i-got-1/](https://writers.abbtech4u.com/all-i-got-1/) here u go dear



I awkwardly put the apple down.

“Um... Did you forget something at home?”

Penney looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole. She didn’t care about friendship or my desperate look begging her to stay. She just bolted.

Very soon, only Eiden and I were left in the living room.

He acted as if nothing had happened, handing the breakfast to me.

“Come on, eat. You shouldn’t skip breakfast with your sensitive stomach.”

Eiden Riley was thirty-five, but he had aged well. The years only made him seem more refined and composed.

He looked even more attractive than when we first met.

It had been love at first sight for me.

Even though time had eroded some of the passion, seeing him still made my heart flutter.

I took the breakfast from him. “Thanks.”

Eiden sat across from me, quietly watching as I ate.

After a long moment, he finally asked, “Why do you have to break up with me?”

I smiled but didn’t answer directly. “Do you love me?”

“We’re a great match,” he said without hesitation.

That answer didn’t surprise me.

In all our four years together, he had never once told me he loved me.

The thing he said the most to his friends about me was that I’d make a great wife.

I came from an educated family and was an only child. I lived in Michal City, held a good degree, and looked presentable enough.

But most importantly was that I loved him.

Because I loved him, I always put him first. I became a housewife, cared for his parents...

And even though he never said he loved me, he did become more attentive over time.

He never needed me to warn him. He’d automatically keep his distance from other women, let me know where he was, notice my moods and cheer me up.

Despite his demanding job, he still managed to cook dinner and help around the house.

Even my parents couldn’t stop singing his praises.

I stirred my coffee absentmindedly. It was warm, but it couldn’t thaw the chill inside me.

I smiled and said suddenly, “Eiden, do you know I had a fever the day before yesterday?”

He paused, caught off guard.

“I knew... but I was away on a business trip. I couldn’t make it back in time.”

I nodded.

That was true.

He even liked my Instagram post that day, leaving a comment: Don’t forget your breakfast.

Still, despite gestures like that, Eiden wasn’t bad to me.

He was actually very thoughtful in our day-to-day life.

Like that time I tripped and bruised my knee.

I pulled up my pant leg and pouted, trying to get sympathy.

He frowned and said, “Why are you so careless?”

Then he went to cook pasta for me.

The pasta was cooked just right.

But I still felt like something was missing.

Eiden tapped lightly on the table. A subtle sign of his growing impatience.

“So... you want to break up just because I couldn’t come back when you had a fever?”

He thought I was being unreasonable.

I shook my head.

That wasn’t it.

Otherwise, I wouldn’t have held on for four years.

I answered, “I just think we’re not right for each other.”

“Feelings go both ways. It’s not enough for just one person to think you’re a good match. To me, this relationship has been a mistake.”

Eiden fell silent.

In the end, he didn’t try to argue.

He just left me with, “Get some rest. I’ll come by again when I have time,” and walked out.

Eiden’s biggest flaw was that he hated communicating.

No, that’s not quite right.

He hated having deeper conversations with me.

I’d seen how well he interacted with people at work. At that time, he would be confident, social, completely in his element.

But when it came to me, he always backed off at the first sign of conflict.

To put it bluntly, he was used to the silent treatment.

He’d wait until my anger passed, then come and soothe me with a gift or something nice.

Chapter 2 Suddenly, I remembered the first time I met him.

It was at an art exhibition.

Eiden was standing in front of a sunflower painting, wearing an off-white sweater.

His side profile was sharp and clean. He looked like he belonged in the painting.

At just one glance, my heart skipped a beat.

I had always been bold.

When I liked someone, I did go after for he without hesitation.

So I approached him and started a conversation, trying hard to find something to talk about.

He was very polite.

Even though I clearly didn’t know much about art, he still listened to me ramble for a long time.

Later, he told me he was just curious to see how long I could keep going.

But hearing that only made me feel more giddy.

He had to like me, right? Otherwise, why would he let me talk nonsense for so long?

This man wasn’t pretentious, wasn’t sleazy, and wasn’t showy.

And just like that, I let my hopelessly romantic heart fall for him.

But after four years, Eiden still felt like cold water. No matter how hard I tried, it never got warm.

He was bland to love, but I couldn’t quite throw him away.

Last month, on my birthday, Eiden gave me a necklace.

It was the one I had stared at for a little longer at the mall.

He really was thoughtful.

I asked him at the time, “Do you know why I like this necklace?”

“Because it’s pretty?” he guessed.

“No. Because the pendant is shaped like a star.”

Even after I said that, he still didn’t understand.

I wasn’t surprised.

I had told him before.

When I was little, my dad got very sick.

Before he passed, he held my hand and told me he would become a star and watch over me.

Ever since then, every time I saw a star, I thought of my dad.

Eiden remembered many things about me.

But he never cared quite enough.

He remembered my weak stomach, remembered I didn’t like onions, remembered my mom’s and my birthdays...

All the textbook qualifications for a “good husband.”

But he never really cared about what I truly wanted.

He treated me very well, so well that everyone thought he was the perfect boyfriend.

But that kindness didn’t come from love. It felt more like obligation.

He seemed to have a checklist of “how to treat your girlfriend well,” and he checked off each task like he was running a program.

And Eiden was just the executor of that program.

He came again the next day.

With breakfast, once more.

He sat there, dressed neatly in a suit.

“I really think we shouldn’t break up,” he said.

“Bexley, being together is good for both of us.”

“I promise I’ll be a responsible, qualified husband.”

He sounded sincere—serious, even.

I nodded.

I believed him.

Eiden would become the kind of husband everyone approved of.

I smiled and said, “I remember you never wanted a dog, but you still agreed when I asked.”

“That’s because you read a post titled ‘How to Make Your Girlfriend Happy.’”

I tapped his phone.

“And in your Notes app, you wrote: ‘If girlfriend wants a pet, don’t say no.’”

Eiden looked at me, puzzled.

“Weren’t you happy about that?”

“I was. But the problem is that those things you do for me, they’re not unique.”

Any girl who looked like “wife material” would’ve been treated the same way.

He still looked confused.

“But... does that matter?”

I stood up.

It had taken me four years to understand Eiden’s feelings, or rather, the lack of them.

He didn’t love me.

Maybe I could’ve kept lying to myself.

But then I heard from someone about his passionate first love.

When he loved someone, he was completely different.

He got jealous, threw tantrums, became flustered just trying to keep her happy...

He didn’t have it all together all the time.

The way he treated me, the attentiveness and the care, it all came from what he learned from that failed relationship.

He had just applied those lessons to me.

And then, Eiden walked out again.

Chapter 3 He had just left when my mom called.

“You’re going on that blind date this weekend. No more excuses.”

“Okay.”

I curled my lip. Fine, I’d go.

Mom’s voice came through, full of frustration.

“You stubborn girl. Eiden is such a good man and you still weren’t satisfied. You’ll regret this someday.”

“Mom, if I hadn’t broken up with him, I’d be regretting it right now.”

“You just tell me the truth. Did you cheat? Or did he?”

I fell silent.

It wasn’t really cheating. Neither of us had crossed any lines.

Eiden Riley was a perfectly suitable boyfriend.

When he first ran into his ex, he told me immediately who she was. The girl had even been calm and gracious, saying they were long over.

Everything seemed reasonable. Flawless.

But that night, after we got home, Eiden had casually said, “It’s raining again.”

Women in love turn into Sherlock Holmes.

In that moment, I had a strange, gut-deep feeling that he was thinking about someone else.

And I said it out loud: “Are you worried she’ll get caught in the rain?”

“Yeah, she’s not in great health. She always catches a cold when it rains.”

See? Eiden was always so open with me. Honest, to a fault.

But that kind of honesty made me uncomfortable.

It felt like he didn’t care at all that I might get jealous.

That weekend, I met my blind date at a café.

He looked sharp, shrewd, even calculating, the moment he walked in.

The second he sat down, he started attacking me over my age.

“Bexley Russell, right? You’re pretty, but you’re too old. In a few more years, you’ll be hitting menopause.”

“Before we get married, you’ll need a check-up to make sure you can still have kids.”

“Oh, and it has to be a boy. Our family’s rich, so you just need to focus on giving birth…”

My scalp tingled. I forced a dry laugh and nodded a few times.

Then I picked up a fake phone call and left.

Before I even stepped inside the house, I could hear laughter from the living room.

My mom, Eiden’s mom, and his dad were all there.

Eiden was sitting off to the side, thoughtfully pouring juice for the three elders.

The moment I walked in, Mom’s face darkened.

“Bexley, get over here.”

Mrs. Riley rushed to smooth things over.

She came up, took my hand gently, and patted it.

“Bexley, I understand. Every couple has their little fights sometimes. But we’ve all seen how much Eiden cares about you. He truly loves you.”

“Think about it. These past few years, he’s taken care of everything for you, including our clothes, food, daily needs. Men like him don’t come around often, you know.”

Mom frowned.

“His parents flew in from Asteria just to talk to you.”

“Mom, seriously, what are you doing?”

I was overwhelmed with frustration.

Eiden sat across from me in silence, just watching.

See? Even now, he was still so calm.

Eiden’s father, Bernd Riley, spoke with a serious tone.

“Bexley, Eiden may be a bit quiet, but he really pays attention to you. His whole photo album is filled with pictures of you.”

“When your mom was in the hospital, he worked all day and still stayed by her side every night. He was more attentive than me and his mother combined…”

I wanted to explain myself, but my mom shot me a glare that made me swallow it all down.

Suddenly, I just felt so tired.

Everyone around me was on the other side.

Eiden finally spoke, his voice still as humble and gentle as ever.

“Bexley, can we try again? Please give me another chance…”

Looking at the whole setup, I found it laughable.

Eiden handed me a glass of warm water, just like he always had. Perfectly on cue, doing what any “100% thoughtful boyfriend” would do.

Everyone’s eyes were on me.

Hopeful. Pressuring. Judging like if I resisted any more, I’d be branded immature and ungrateful.

Night had fully fallen.

The living room lights were bright, but they couldn’t reach the shadow that had settled in my heart.

“Bexley!” Eiden came over and tried to hold my hand. “Let’s get back together, okay?”

“Absolutely not.”

Chapter 4 After Eiden’s family left, Mom slapped me across the face.

I clenched my jaw.

“If you weren’t ready to let go, then why did you send me on that blind date?”

“I wanted you to see just how good Eiden is!”

Mom raised her voice.

“You’ve been spoiled by him these past few years. You don’t know how hard life really is.”

“Do you have any idea how hard it is for someone like you to find a decent partner?”

“The guy messaged me back saying you were old, rude, and way too picky.”

“Bexley, you’re 29, not 19! Stop messing around, will you?”

I slammed the door on my way out.

The night breeze still carried the warmth of late summer, but it couldn’t blow away the heaviness in my heart.

The leaves rustled sharply in the wind.

I kicked a pebble by the curb, and before I realized it, tears were falling down my cheeks.

How had a simple breakup turned into this whole “everyone versus me” circus?

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

It was a message from Penney.

“How’d the blind date go? Want me to come drink with you?”

I was just about to reply when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw two figures sitting on a bench nearby.

It was Eiden.

And next to him was Winnie Flynn, his first love.

I turned to leave but accidentally kicked an empty bottle on the ground.

The sharp sound instantly caught their attention.

Eiden whipped his head around.

When our eyes met, I saw a look in his face I’d never seen before. He was panic and helplessness.

Winnie Flynn looked up too, her cheeks still streaked with tears.

Eiden stood up quickly and hurried toward me, his steps rushed.

“Bexley, what are you doing here?”

“Just getting some air. Don’t mind me. You two carry on.”

I forced a smile.

Eiden stared at me, eyes full of complicated emotions.

“Are you misunderstanding something?”

“No.”

I shook my head.

We were exes now. There was nothing to misunderstand.

Winnie came over too.

Her voice was low and muffled.

“Miss Russell, please don’t get the wrong idea. I was just… feeling a bit down, and Eiden was comforting me...”

“That’s between you two. It’s got nothing to do with me.”

I waved a hand, growing impatient.

Everything tonight was just going wrong.

“Bexley!”

Eiden frowned. His tone turned weary and irritated.

“Don’t take your anger out on Winnie.”

“Me?”

I pointed at myself, baffled.

Eiden looked at me with disappointment, then turned and took Winnie’s hand.

“Let’s go. Let her calm down on her own.”

Winnie gave me a regretful glance, then left with him.

In the cold wind, I pulled my jacket tighter and walked away.

I threw myself into work to distract myself.

My usually stone-faced boss had complimented me five times this week.

“Not bad. If you keep working like this, a promotion and raise won’t be far off.”

Nickler Grant looked at me with approval.

I kept a straight face but was flipping him off in my mind.

And yet, Eiden still came to wait for me outside the office after work.

As if nothing had happened.

“Bexley, let’s go home. It might rain soon.”

I didn’t move.

“Eiden, I told you, you don’t need to come here anymore.”

“But why? Why are you suddenly breaking up with me?”

Eiden truly couldn’t understand.

We had gotten along so well. How did it come to this?

Behind me, Nickler Grant’s voice rang out.

“Maybe it’s because she still hasn’t gotten over her first love with me.”

I moved to Dubai not too long ago, and something surprised me — even though the city is full of events and people, it’s not always easy to find someone to join you for something specific.

Like last week, I wanted to catch a movie on a random Tuesday night, but most friends were busy, and I didn’t feel like going alone. Same for grabbing coffee in a new spot or a last-minute beach walk.

So I’m curious — if you want to do something and your usual circle is busy, how do you find someone to join you? Do you use group chats, apps, meetups… or just skip it?",3,1754986576.0,expats,5,0.8,False

She kept apologising for not replying back instantly and also like heart reacts my messages. She also is like “oh we should do that together”. I kinda want to know if she’s interested as more than friends because I’m definitely interested in her as more than a friend but idk how to ask/make it clear. I’m also useless at flirting and I hate being direct because I don’t wanna come across as creepy.

My fiancée (30F) is a doctor earning around $150k–$200k. We live in *my* house. Since she’s saving for her residency, I’ve never asked her to pay rent, utilities, or groceries.

I handle most household chores because I know her job is demanding. I cook for her, make sure her bed’s ready, and basically try to make home a place where she can rest without worrying about money or chores.

Recently, I found out she treats her coworkers every single day. She admits she’s a people pleaser, so I let it slide at first. But it hit me if she can be that generous with other people, why does it feel like everything she does for me comes with conditions or strings attached?

Example: I asked her to turn off the lights once because our electric bill hit $1,000 (about $200 USD). She angrily handed me $40 for electricity the *only* time she’s ever chipped in for bills, even though I pay about $800–$1,000/month. She’s complained about the cost of rides from my place to work, but even with that, she saves more living here than renting her own place. One day she had the day off and actually slept well. I asked her to wash the dishes. She got mad and called her mom to join the argument something I’ve told her before is a dealbreaker. This wasn’t the first time she’s dragged her family into our disagreements.

Today we argued again when she was telling me (cheerfully) how she regularly buys her coworkers food and coffee. I told her it hurts that she’s so generous to them but keeps score when it comes to me. She tracks everything she gives me but not what she gives them.

In the heat of the moment, I said, “If this is how it’s going to be, just move out.” I know that was harsh, but I’m feeling unappreciated and like we’re not really partners more like I’m a live-in support system while she gives her best to other people.

AITA for saying that? Or am I just being overly sensitive and not understanding how stressful her job is?",62,1754986526.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,45,0.97,False
