I received my fellow Aiden about a month ago and have been brewing 90% of my coffee on it ever since. I brew a 750-800ml batch 5 days a week. I currently have a light roast natural processed coffee but have been struggling to get a great cup out of it. I feel like I need to nail down the grind size first. What grind size have you been going to for a small to medium batch brew? 

I also grind with an 078 but would still appreciate grind sizes from other grinders so I can make an educated guess at the micron size. 

Something else I have noticed is insanely fast draw downs. My brew profile is 1:3 bloom and then 3 pulses 20 seconds apart. I have noticed that it draws down really fast, like 10 seconds after the pulse and it's no longer a continuous stream. Even making large grind size adjustments makes little difference in the fast draw down. I know the 078 is low fines but this seams too fast?? ",1,1740607759.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

1iyzr22,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iyzr22/how_do_i_get_over_the_insecurity_of_my_gf_having/,How do I get over the insecurity of my GF having a large number of exes?,"Just to start, I'm not judging her for having them but she has had 12 BFs and slept with 20-30 guys. She's 39 by the way. 

I don't want it to be an issue for me but I'm finding myself perpetually anxious over it. 

As a 40 year old man, I've only ever had 2 long time girlfriends and 1 short term relationship. 

It's a moral thing for me lersianlito only sleep with someone when I really feel a connection and am sure that I want to be with them. So fundamentally I guess we're different on that front.

Another thing that bothered me was that she initially told me that she'd never really dated or had a boyfriend before. I slept with her with that in mind once we ready to do so. But then stories started creeping in about ""my ex and I did this and did that"". So I pointed out that she'd never had exes before and she said ""oh I meant I haven't really had any BFs in the last 3 years."" She had only dated people and not got fully intimate with them (and slept apparently with one person in that time).

Before that (which she deems to be a long time ago) she had one long term boyfriend of 2 1/2 years  leading up to that hiatus and many beforehand.

Again, not meaning to sound judgemental but I was upset at the lie and that I was essentially coerced into dating someone who had different morals and background to what I initially thought. 

For the record I still would have dated her if she'd been honest but it was a factor in my connection with her that we shared a similar mindset and background on the matter.

But now I'm perpetually finding myself wondering about her exes. Once she admitted it She offered more details and she said she's dated ""every sort of man in all shapes and sizes but that she didn't ever take it seriously like she does with me"".

There is just something that unfortunately feels dishonest and I'm dwelling in things that shouldn't be important. But my insecurities and disappointment and the bending if the truth is leaving me constantly anxious and uncomfortable.

To add, she has also warned me that she still sees some of her exes in a work capacity (her job involves flying around the world and meeting lots of people in conferences, festivals and events) and that she stays in contact with some of those people on a regular basis.

Another tough one was that she told me the last person she dated was a year ago and it turned out it was only 6 weeks prior to us meeting (been together 4 months now). She also told me that she'd been on a date with a guy in LA last year and that they'd been sending flirty sexual messages to each other for a few months (turns out again it was for nearly a year). 

She then told me that she'd deleted all of the conversations on her WhatsApp with those people (I never asked her to but she said she was worried I'd see something and get upset). I asked why she only deleted their comments and not their contacts and she said she would delete the contact if the guy she dated but not the guy from LA because he might need to contact her for work. 

She holds a yearly event in LA so this worries me. I asked if she invites him to this events and she said she never did. 

The trouble is, I'd seen her messaging this guy and recognised after the point that it was him, and she had indeed invited him to the event a couple of months ago and he'd suggested meeting up. She said ""it might be awkward as I have a BF now"" and he said something about never mind, it happens and let's just meet for coffee next time to which she agreed. 

I was honest and said I'd seen her writing those messages and assumed it was him so I knew she was lying. She admitted that she had actually lied but that it was so I wouldn't be upset and that that was the only time she'd messaged him. 

But the fact she refuses to delete his contact in case she needs to see or work with him again makes me really uncomfortable.

All of a sudden, the taste of Equal has changed. Where it used to be VERY sweet when I used 3 or 4 packets for coffee, now I have to use 5 or 6 and it still doesn't taste as sweet. It tastes like the formula was changed some time in the past 12-20 months, unless they sell a different Equal in The Washington/Baltimore/Virginia  stores (and I know they don't!). Something's happened that the taste has changed noticeably and it is no longer ""sweet"" in the way that too much sugar in  ANYTHING can taste.

I‚Äôm eating carnivore to support my hormones and heal my body, I was animal based eating a lot of fruit and I packed on a lot of fat percentage presuming I was experiencing high insulin resistance I decided to go keto carnivore.

Supplements before bed I take magnesium glycinate, passionflower/Valerie‚Äôs root, Ashwaganda (just started this past week)

During the day I take a methylated b (mthfr gene) along with zinc, vit d, copper, iron and dim to support excess estrogen.

I don‚Äôt drink, I have low stress.

TLDR: I am struggling hardcore with low motivation at work. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of things to feel better, but now im thinking maybe I need to go back to school or take time off - both of those choices have downsides though. 

Some context: early 30s, single, no kids, 2 pets, renter, mid-range COLA

I have been struggling with low motivation for a long time. Like probably 5 years (I graduated into the pandemic and have worked in my field ever since). I have been in therapy, I‚Äôve taken psych and other medical meds for underlying conditions. I‚Äôve switched jobs. I‚Äôve switched locations. I got the highest paid job I‚Äôve ever had. And still, I just feel bored and unmotivated at work. I spend a lot of my free time sort of zoned out and exhausted. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed that I got an MS for my field (and LOVED my grad program), that I have a good job, and that I don‚Äôt want it because I truly realize how fortunate I am. It took me a  *long* time to get here. I think some people at work might think that I‚Äôm ‚Äúslow‚Äù because I don‚Äôt get very much done. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve lost the will to work. 

There are some practical reasons I don‚Äôt like my job: long commute 3 days/week  (too expensive to live closer), overbearing supervisor and coworker, no windows, bureaucratic nonsense, tasks aren‚Äôt my favorite. 

I look for new jobs every day, but I don‚Äôt want any of them. I have also been considering going back to school to either expand my abilities in my current field or move in a different direction, but I am worried about taking on more student loans.

I fantasize about living off my savings for a few months and working at a coffee shop, but I don‚Äôt have a ton saved, so that would be pretty risky for me. 

I want some kind of guarantee that my next step will lead to better life satisfaction :
- maybe going back to school will help me get a job that‚Äôs more aligned with my interests
- maybe taking a break will give me a clear head

I am tired of living with the shame of being unmotivated. I know I am a capable person.

If anyone has any sage advice that could help me figure out my next steps, I would appreciate it.

Hi. For those of you who don‚Äôt know me on here, my name is Emma Bruntil. I‚Äôm a wrestler for Team USA. I‚Äôm a 2x NCAA Champion, 2x US Open Champion, and a senior world team member. I‚Äôm a BJJ blue belt, and teach a lot of awesome people in the BJJ community how to wrestle. I thought and sat on this post for a really, really long time. Almost a year, to be exact. I‚Äôve wrote and re-wrote it dozen times, unsure how to translate into words exactly how difficult of an experience this has all been for me. In the beginning, after breaking up with my then Fiance√®, Jacob Couch, I was too traumatized and confused to really make sense of what had exactly happened. By the time we broke up, on May 1st of 2024, I was cut off from virtually everyone. Even my parents didn‚Äôt know that I was in an abusive relationship. 

Let‚Äôs rewind to the fall of 2021. At the time, I was in an extremely toxic environment. My coach, upon finding out that I had herniated my c5-6 disk only 1 year post neck surgery, told me in no plainer terms that unless I could compete, I would not be coached anymore. Meanwhile, my arm would be so numb after practices due to my neck injury, it felt like it wasn‚Äôt attached to my body anymore. I was scared for my health. 

It was then, that I originally started talking to my ex via Instagram. I went down to PSF, about an hours drive from McKendree, and started training there when I had the free time. At the time, it was exactly what I needed. It was a positive environment where people valued and believed in me. Due to me moving back to the Olympic Training Center, as well as other reasons that aren‚Äôt my business to share, my ex and I went our separate ways.

In March of 2023, my ex and I reconnected when I came out to PSF to run a wrestling camp. We started dating in April of 2023. At the time, I was just beginning my battle with the migraines and neck issues that plagued me all of 2023. Basically, I had a continuous migraine that lasted for 10 months, and was excruciatingly painful. If I wasn‚Äôt training, I was alone in my pitch black room, tying to make the best of my less than ideal situation.

In the beginning, there were warning signs with Jacob‚Äôs He was extremely controlling. He didn‚Äôt want me going out, using Snapchat, dressing in certain ways, wearing make up, or posting certain things on my social media. Due to the fact I was having debilitating migraines around the clock, I saw these things as non-issues. I didn‚Äôt do any of those things anyways because I was in so much pain.

However, we were in a long distance relationship. I didn‚Äôt see a lot of his day to day activities, and he didn‚Äôt see much of mine. At the time, I had just made the senior world team, and was juggling school, 10-15 medical appointments a week just to be functional, and hours a day of training. As things in our relationship started to escalate, their were a lot of things I complied with simply because I didn‚Äôt have the time in the day to deal with another fight over what I was wearing to my lift or which friend I wanted to get coffee with. I was simply in too much pain with my headaches and too tired from the stress of it all. 

Leading into worlds, there were certain scenarios that became quite serious. The night after Final X, my ex and I were staying at a friend‚Äôs house before we were set to fly to Boston to film a BJJ Fanatics video. At 2am, he woke me up yelling and throwing pillows because some of my guy friends and training partners had texted me to congratulate me on making the world team. He made me block all of their numbers immediately after. I almost broke up with him, but then we had to get on a flight the next day and put on a smile for the cameras. 

Every time he would do something crazy like that, to the point where I was about to end the relationship, he would be so remorseful and nice to me. He‚Äôd buy me an expensive flight to go to one of his seminars with him to break up the long distance, or he‚Äôd become the most loving, caring partner in the world. It was all so confusing. Especially considering Jacob‚Äôs reputation in the BJJ world. He‚Äôs known as the ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs champ‚Äù and the ‚Äúnicest guy in BJJ‚Äù. And he would be that guy‚Äî sometimes. Other times, it was like a switch was flipped, and then all hell would break loose. I never knew which version of him I was going to get, the version of him who insisted on opening my doors and calling me ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù, or the guy that would wake me up at 2am screaming.

After the world championships, I was finally able to get the neck surgery I so desperately needed. It was also then when the isolation truly began to set in. Any friends of mine that were independent, or if they didn‚Äôt like Jacob, were deemed a threat by him. I was told I‚Äôd be disrespecting him if I hung out with them. Being that he had my location and he checked it 20 times a day, if I wanted to go see a friend that he didn‚Äôt like, I would have had to leave my phone at home and lie about my whereabouts. I don‚Äôt like to lie. It goes against everything I believe in. So I pulled away from my friends, until the only people I talked to were my brother, my parents, and my then financ√®.

Once he could tell I was fully isolated, and therefore fully invested in the relationship, things started to change. The love bombing and nice spells became shorter. He didn‚Äôt need to apologize for his behavior anymore, once he could sense that I wouldn‚Äôt leave him. After ADCC West Coast Trials, he went out with his friends to a night club on the Vegas strip. I wouldn‚Äôt have cared, except for the fact I hadn‚Äôt been able to so much as see most of my friends for months. He had expressly forbid me from going out our entire relationship, only to do that exact thing himself. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to live by his rules anymore. I started to fight back against them. And that‚Äôs when shit started to get truly crazy. 

To keep me under his control, he started using threats. He told me he‚Äôd get on a plane and find me if I ever cheated on him. He told me he‚Äôd kill me. He started repeating these threats multiple times per week.  When I confronted him about it, he said maybe he wouldn‚Äôt kill me, but that he‚Äôd get on a plane, convince my parents everything was okay, fly to my home state, and stab my childhood dog. Or he would say that I was criticizing him to the point where he‚Äôd kill himself. 

He started demanding that I send him anything I was going to post on social media before I posted it. He told me that I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsubmissive enough‚Äù to him, and I needed to respect the fact that he had the final say on what I could wear or the things I could do. Ironically, while all this was going on, he later admitted he had been going to a Thai massage parlor and getting h*nd j*bs our entire relationship. 

The more he felt his control of me slipping, the crazier and more escalated he was willing to become. Even to the point of bursting in the room and yelling with his finger in my face when I was hanging out with one of my friends, all because he thought that individual was bisexual. Slowly, almost every aspect of my life was under his control. It was incredibly scary.

When Olympic trials was going on, I was heavily concussed and couldn‚Äôt compete. Depressed, I retreated to the mountains, where there was no cell service. For a few days, I was actually happy. I sent him a video on the summit of my 28th Colorado 14‚Äôer. Once I got back into service, he called me, extremely angry, because I had agreed to run a wrestling practice without his permission. When I started crying, he said that I was never happy enough for him. He said I needed to stop acting so sad all the time. This cycle continued for about 2 weeks, which he later admitted was a punishment for a medical decision I had made. 

After that, I tried not to get upset as much in front of him. I was too scared I would set him off. But every night after hanging up the phone, I would cry myself to sleep, wondering how I had gotten so deep into such a mess.

Finally, on a trip to Mount Vernon to visit him, We broke up. He woke me up one morning by kicking the pillows again, and I knew he was angry. I walked out into the living room, to him telling me ‚Äúyoure done‚Äù, with the crazy look in his eyes that I had began to associate with pure insanity. I knew I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, but I realized at that moment that it didn‚Äôt matter if I had. It was all about if he thought I had done something wrong. When I saw that look in his eyes, I knew that no amount of reasoning with him would help. He was a 210 pound BJJ black belt that had been telling me for weeks that he would kill me. And here we were. In that moment, I shut down. When he was yelling, I told myself I would do or say whatever it took to make it out of there in one piece. Luckily, I did manage to do that.

Over the summer, I visited PSF. Heath had called me after the break up, and supported me still training at PSF. I truly thank him for that. I didn‚Äôt want to let one person ruin my plan of switching to BJJ eventually, or keep me from seeing the people that had become family to me. 

Unfortunately, things with Jacob were still crazy. While I was there, he began to keep tabs on me, accusing me and other male members of the team of being together if we both missed a practice at the same time (I was training wrestling over an hour away during certain practice times). He showed up at the gym when I was drilling with a male teammate. He had the crazy look in his eyes, and said that he had shoved a 13 year old kids face into the floor out of anger, and had to come to the gym and so that he wouldn‚Äôt snap the kids neck. But I knew that he had showed up to keep tabs on me, and had said what he said just to intimidate me. He later admitted to me that was indeed the case.

When we went to seminars as a team, he said followed me all around the air bnb‚Äôs we stayed at, and would get angry if I talked to any male teammates. I was the only girl on those trips. At a few of the seminars, other teammates of mine slept on the floor so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to share a bed with anyone and risk setting him off. During that time, we had been broken up for over 3 months and all of this felt like pure insanity. But he was competing at ADCC the following week, and I didn‚Äôt want to do anything provoke him before such a big competition. 

In October, I decided to move to PSF full-time, just to have some time away from the wrestling world & take care of my health. I knew I needed friends, and a community, and between PSF and coaching at McKendree, I knew I would have that. I‚Äôm sure some people might be confused as to why I decided to move to PSF despite the situation with my ex. I get it. But to me, I spent 2.5 years of my life at McKendree building a community for myself. And another 3 years after that visiting and training at PSF. Before and after my ex, it was always my plan to train at PSF eventually. I was walking the fine line of not wanting to get hurt, but also not wanting to let him stop me from living life on my terms. Maybe that decision makes me look stupid, or naive at the very least. To me, I was just doing what I thought was right at the time. 

Regardless of intention, I definitely wasn‚Äôt sure how things would go when I moved. My therapist recommended I get a specific type of restraining order that would prevent him from stalking me, but Fortunately for me, he left me alone. Truthfully, though, I was constantly on edge, worrying that if his (now) partner were to break up with him, that he would start keeping tabs on me again. 

It‚Äôs easy to see a person in an abusive relationship and think ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt they just leave?‚Äù I know I used to. It wasn‚Äôt until Jacob and I broke up and I read the book ‚ÄúWhy Does He Do That‚Äù that I began to truly understand the way abusers minds work. I felt ashamed that I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was in an abusive relationship until almost a year into it. After all, wasn‚Äôt I the least likely demographic to suffer from abuse? I‚Äôm a wrestler. I‚Äôve been taught how to defend myself, to stand up for myself, and to be confident in my decisions. But the thing is‚Äî abusive relationships don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre an athlete in combat sports or not. They don‚Äôt discriminate, and they can happen to anyone.

During the time I was in a relationship with Jacob, it felt like he had slowly chipped away at all the things I valued, until I didn‚Äôt even know who i was anymore. Towards the end of our relationship, I remember telling him that I didn‚Äôt even recognize my reflection in the mirror. I was a complete stranger, even to myself. It was the most lonely feeling in the world. 

I‚Äôm sure some people might read this and think ‚ÄúOkay, why are you sharing this? Why now?‚Äù. Maybe they think I‚Äôm lying, or that I‚Äôm trying to bring attention to myself. For a long time I was certain I wouldn‚Äôt share my story, because in my mind it seemed like it was such a lose-lose scenario. If people thought I was a liar, I would just be labeled as the girl who tried to ruin the ‚Äúnicest guy in BJJ‚Äôs life‚Äù. If they believed me, then I had to admit that all of those things did actually happen to me, which I was already deeply ashamed about.

Ultimately, I decided to share this, almost a year later, because I don‚Äôt want other women to fall into the same trap that I did, especially not with that individual. I am a lot of things‚Äî a wrestler, an athlete, a daughter, a friend, but at the forefront of all of those things, I‚Äôm a woman. And I care about other women‚Äôs safety and happiness. 

Also, I have always believed that the truth will set you free. I blamed myself for a long time for ‚Äúallowing‚Äù all the abuse to happen. I felt like an enormous failure. There would also be times when I was just in complete denial of the entire experience. It felt like my brain had blocked out so many of the traumatic memories, that I would find myself questioning what was even real anymore. ‚ÄúWas it really that bad?‚Äù I would ask myself. He didn‚Äôt beat me. He didn‚Äôt strangle me. I‚Äôm still here, after all. 

My therapist, who I am so very grateful for, helped me unpack all of those beliefs. She told me that death threats technically are physical abuse, as well as criminal threats. Most importantly, she told me I would never truly heal until I actually accepted what had happened. As much as I might wish I never went through an abusive relationship‚Äî I did. While I don‚Äôt have physical scars, the psychological ones took away everything that made me who I am. 

Lastly‚Äî I‚Äôm so grateful to have such amazing friends and family. They have supported me wholeheartedly throughout the entire process of rebuilding myself. I love them more than I can even say. 

If you‚Äôre still here reading this‚Äî I want to extend that thank you to you as well. Thank you for letting me share my story and experiences, no matter how difficult it was to write all of this. Thank you for allowing me to share my truth.

The nigh day-long bicycle ride through the fir-laden backcountry to my uncle-in-law‚Äôs reclusive seaside cabin was a pleasant one, though its conclusion wasn‚Äôt lost on me. The gales that July day were the kind to stab straight through you, leaving you a bag of brittle bones in their wake. Even cocooned in a hardy layer of wool garments, the frigid Pacific cold front couldn‚Äôt be kept at bay. By the time I reached the door my hands had long since gone white, and drowsiness beckoned warmly.

I lingered outside on the porch for a while nonetheless, so that I might take in the lighthouse by the water in all its splendour, and bask in rays of sunshine now ephemeral, the dissipation of their delicate heat into my skin no doubt soon to be thwarted by the incoming evening storm creeping over the horizon.

Finding the moment just, I decided to give my uncle a call, if only to thank him for lending me the property for my weekend getaway and notify him of my arrival.

‚ÄúFret not!‚Äù he reassured me in his customary hearty tone. ‚ÄúWell, good. *Good*‚Ä¶ What simply wondrous news. How was the trip over?‚Äù

I laughed and spoke to him of the things I‚Äôd seen on the way, recounting rolling flowery fields and cotton candy-looking clouds that floated idly by. It was when I made mention of the lighthouse, and how beautiful it was, perched there on the end of the bay, that he went eerily silent.

‚ÄúR-really?‚Äù he finally sputtered.

‚ÄúWhat: *really?*‚Äù I asked light-heartedly.

There followed a lengthy pause. My uncle‚Äôs voice was monotone when he answered.

‚ÄúAre you outside, watching it as we speak?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, yes,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThe view truly is something, is it not?‚Äù

‚ÄúDescribe it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDescribe wh-‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lighthouse. Describe it.‚Äù

I opted to disregard his sudden peculiar state and play along. I took a gander at the lighthouse, nestled between a crag and the sweeping sandy beach.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a quaint little thing, an unassuming one at that. Light yellow with a tiny window in the midd-‚Äù

‚ÄúWith a red cupola and gallery atop the tower?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou see it too?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I see it,‚Äù I said, uncertain whether my amusement ought to be concern. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *there*.‚Äù

Another pause, longer.

‚ÄúAlice... *Normal* people don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean, they don‚Äôt *notice* it in all likelihood? It isn‚Äôt exactly in-your-face. Nor does it stick out like a sore thumb.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he sighed deeply. ‚ÄúI mean they *can‚Äôt* see it. It doesn‚Äôt *exist*. I mean it *does*, just not to *them*.‚Äù When he felt my confusion, he added: ‚ÄúI know this is your first time visiting my cabin, but I can assure you there isn‚Äôt supposed to be any lighthouse there. There never was for me until very recently.‚Äù

I chuckled to myself.

‚ÄúPerhaps they built it over the winter,‚Äù I offered. ‚ÄúAfter all, you only just opened up the shack for summer last week. You‚Äôve been away in the city the remainder of the year.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no. Nobody ever built it. It doesn‚Äôt *really* exist!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm *not normal* then, am I not? Seeing as I‚Äôm seeing it...‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre the only other person I know who has. You and I were *chosen*.‚Äù

‚ÄúChosen? Whatever for?... Uncle Barry, is everything okay? You‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù

Was this some attempt at a ruse? I‚Äôd never known my uncle as being much of a trickster.

‚ÄúFurther, the family came along with me last week,‚Äù he persisted as though I hadn‚Äôt spoken.

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lighthouse, it isn‚Äôt new, in fact it‚Äôs surprisingly old. My family, they were with me.‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúAnd what did they have to say about this?‚Äù I queried sternly.

‚ÄúOh, God forbid they ever find out about the lighthouse!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve not talked to them about it at all?‚Äù I exclaimed.

‚ÄúMost certainly not. I was... *prepared*. Quite serendipitously so too.‚Äù

‚ÄúPrithee, tell me why not,‚Äù I responded sarcastically, frustrated by his seemingly purposeful lack of clarity.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs best they not find out about it, lest the lighthouse reveals itself to them as well. We were all present, yet the lighthouse only became visible to me, the sole individual who knew about it beforehand.‚Äù

Waves crashed and washed away rhythmically off in the distance, severing my uncle‚Äôs words and rendering them more incoherent than they already were.

‚ÄúHow can one have knowledge pertaining to something no one has seen?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs I said, I was somewhat prepared, hence my not telling them about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt imagine seeing a lighthouse is the most special of events, and could see seeing one not cropping up in conversation. How are you to know your family didn‚Äôt see it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

I felt exasperated, the migraine that had pestered me since dawn now exacerbated by a discussion resembling more a merry-go-round than it did an actual discussion.

‚ÄúYou fear telling your family, yet here I stand, beholding a lighthouse I knew nothing of. How can your theory thus possibly hold?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I get that you‚Äôre ups-‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd whatever would you be trying to achieve in the first place, sparing their eyes from something as innocuous as a lighthouse?‚Äù

‚ÄúI really can‚Äôt explain...‚Äù

‚ÄúThen *try*.‚Äù

It felt to me he was beating around the bush, stalling, like there was something more.

‚ÄúI probably shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time I went to bed...‚Äù

My uncle sighed again, clearly ambivalent about something.

‚ÄúAlice, you see, the hut‚Äôs been in the family for centuries. For generations it‚Äôs been the place where our ancestors spent their summers. And of them all only one ever wrote about a lighthouse in a dusty journal I happened upon in the attic. A lighthouse that appeared overnight, one that only he could perceive. He said everyone thought he‚Äôd gone mad.

‚ÄúNaturally I didn‚Äôt believe a word of it either, but studied the entries regardless, and from those unknowingly gathered enough to be prepared for when I would eventually see it for myself, not that I expected I ever would.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm... I‚Äôm not sure I follow...‚Äù I began. Nonsensical and lacklustre though my uncle‚Äôs postulations were, there was a seriousness underlying them that simply couldn‚Äôt be ignored.

‚ÄúThat written account is precisely a hundred years old, but that‚Äôs not all. I found a discarded painting, caked in cobwebs, predating the journal by another hundred-odd years. It‚Äôs a depiction of a lighthouse. *The* lighthouse. It reoccurs periodically. So it appears.

‚ÄúI need to know now, the door at its base, is it open? Is the entrance open?‚Äù

Asking why he took interest in something as mundane as a door was pointless. I didn‚Äôt much care. I simply peered at the lighthouse, at the doorway facing me.

‚ÄúIt is indeed, happy?‚Äù I said. Had it been open from the start? I‚Äôd been outside for so long I could no longer remember.

‚ÄúOh. I see.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you quit keeping things from me!‚Äù I snapped.

‚ÄúThe **Keeper**.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh??‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Keeper‚Äôs coming for you. Once the door is open, it means the Keeper‚Äôs seen you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚Äú*The lighthouse keeper.*‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what inhabits the lighthouse. An ancient curse that runs in our bloodline. Alice, I‚Äôm so terribly sorry, but there‚Äôs absolutely nothing you or I can do anymore. It was meant to be me, but I ran, managed to get away in time.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd understood from reading the journal that the door isn‚Äôt always open. Once it is however, that‚Äôs really all she wrote. Our ancestor‚Äôs writings spanned over a handful of days, time during which he described the lighthouse and recurring unsettling visions he was having. In his final entry, he stated that something had changed: the door had mysteriously been opened.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs any of that got to do with me?‚Äù I blurted out after fruitless reflection, my words unable to help taking on a more morose character.

‚ÄúGranted few and far between, it‚Äôs well known within the family that over the years there have been... acciden- *No*, fuck this, I can‚Äôt...‚Äù My uncle stopped, audibly overcome with emotion.

The sun suffocated in a thick veil of grey then, and the cold swooped down on me with great fervency.

‚Äú*Uncle Barry?*‚Äù

I waited anxiously, the questions swirling around in my head plenty.

This seemed real enough. The lighthouse was, wasn‚Äôt it? I mean, obviously it was real. After all, there it was, right? Right *there*. But was it *real* real, the type of real my uncle propounded it was? The type that wasn‚Äôt *really* real for most but for some was? Was that really what it was?

Was the Keeper *real* too? And what if the Keeper was?

I didn‚Äôt want to talk to any keeper. I didn‚Äôt want to be disturbed while on my solo break. I didn‚Äôt wa-

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it to be one of my children,‚Äù Uncle Barry continued grimly. ‚ÄúI knew it was merely a matter of time before it revealed itself to someone else, given that I would never return. So I sent you there under the pretence of spending a nice relaxing weekend. *Fuck.* I‚Äôm so- I- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fu- *What the hell have I done?*‚Äù

His breaths were heavy. Short. Almost mimicking the ocean‚Äôs to-and-fros.

A sniffle. Another sniffle. More sniffles.

Quiet. How I detested that. In it I tried drawing some semblance of sense from the mess my uncle had laid out before me, to no avail. None of it was true, I tried telling myself over and over.

‚ÄúI hope you can find it in you to forgive me, for though this was a decision, it was no choice‚Ä¶‚Äù were his parting words, and swiftly he hung up, leaving me alone with the howling wind and its hardly comforting touch, on a beach with a lighthouse bearing some degree of existence.

I didn‚Äôt know just what to do then, and so, ensconced within the confines of the cabin‚Äîwith the apprehension my uncle had imparted to me festering and indignation gnawing away at any thoughts outstanding‚Äîfrantically in a makeshift journal of my own I wrote, before darkness swallowed the world and I was unable to see the lighthouse and its gaping door anymore.

&nbsp;

Rain battered the windows incessantly as night dragged inexorably on. The first traces of pale light eventually did start to bleed through a stagnant sea fog that clung to the world like a wet rag, staining everything a sickly sheen of silver. I ventured out onto the porch once more, a mug of scalding coffee in hand to counteract the nip in the air.

It had dawned on me just what a gullible idiot I was. A series of missed calls followed by a pitiful text from my uncle validated as much: *‚ÄòI regret what I said. Don‚Äôt leave the cabin! I‚Äôm on my way to make things right‚Ä¶‚Äô*

I overlooked the shore and wrote in my trusty guestbook to kill the time, ready to tear into him‚Äîprovided he wasn‚Äôt taking the piss about coming here too.

#Guestbook Entry, July 10 / The Keeper‚Äôs Keep

There was an inertness to Barry as engrossing as it was dismaying. One spreading to you like a sickness as you watched, *swallowing* you in its undeniable reality.
	
Barry‚Äôs expression had softened, from that of discomfort to something approximating (dare I say blas√©?) disorientation, though placing it precisely wasn‚Äôt elementary without his eyes anymore. They were the first things to go.

Intently, I watched the earth beneath Barry change shades until none of him remained, after which what he‚Äôd gone into promptly watched me, those eyes affirming what I‚Äôd reluctantly come to expect: that room had been *kept* for me.

I‚Äôd have died for Barry to suffice, something which had in a certain respect proven to be true given the last of him hadn‚Äôt been wolfed down with quite the same vigour the rest had.

But it wasn‚Äôt. A dark *descent* of my own would come.

For this wasn‚Äôt a question of mere satiation.

This was *sport* above all else, and the shift from need to desire an immaterial dichotomy I could never derive benefit from.",1,1740606843.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt know why this time of all other times I decided to make small talk with him. 
There‚Äôs a mini figure I had always seen on his dashboard and I had the previous knowledge of knowing that he had a daughter so out of curiosity I had asked how old his daughter was which then led to me asking where she goes to school, it happen to be the same one from which I graduated and so that prompted him to ask what year I had graduated. 
Mind you it has been a few years since I have been out of school and really all I have going for myself is this job, maybe it‚Äôs my own doubts and uncertainty of what‚Äôs in store for my future but this applies to why I feel off-put by what he had said. 
He then proceeded to ask if I knew [insert name] to which I had said yes, a few minutes earlier someone else from my old school had passed who also had a similar name so I mistook them for that person, but he replied that it in fact was not them because they were studying elsewhere in the states, he proceeds to show me a picture (which jogged my memory) and talks about how he was valedictorian and how he‚Äôs all smart blah blah blah, essentially gassing him up to which I agreed.

Ever feel like time is slipping through your fingers faster than sand at the beach? Like, seriously, where does it all go? If you're nodding in agreement, welcome to the club! Today, let's tackle one of the most over-discussed yet misunderstood topics ever‚Äî**time management**. Ready to bust some myths and find out what really works?

**Myth #1: Multitasking is the secret sauce to productivity.**  
Sounds impressive, right? Balancing a dozen tasks at once like you're some kind of productivity superhero. But let‚Äôs keep it real‚Äîour brains aren't built for juggling. Multitasking often just means doing a lot of things... poorly. Instead, try the classic *one thing at a time.* You'll be surprised at how much you crush it when you're laser-focused. üïπÔ∏è

**Myth #2: You need to be an early bird to catch the worm.**  
We've all heard the stories of CEOs waking up at 5 AM, right? But newsflash: productivity isn't about the hour you start but how you spend your hours. Whether you're a night owl or an early bird, find your peak hours and own them. It's all about working in sync with your natural rhythm.

**Myth #3: Planning your day hour by hour is foolproof.**  
Life‚Äôs unpredictable‚Äîlike, who knew your morning coffee would decide today‚Äôs the day to rebel against the machine? ü´† Instead of a rigid schedule, try a flexible framework. Block off chunks of time for tasks, but leave room for life's little surprises. Embrace the chaos!

Oh, and speaking of surprises‚Äî**have you ever noticed how the smallest tasks seem to gobble up the most time?** This little phenomenon is known as Parkinson‚Äôs Law: work expands to fill the time available for its completion. So, give yourself (realistic) deadlines, even for the trivial stuff. You might find motivation hiding in the ticking clock. ‚è∞

**So, what's really the magic trick here?** It might just be listening to yourself, rather than every self-help guru with a book deal. What actually works is finding a rhythm that fits YOUR life, not someone else's Pinterest board aesthetic.

Let's keep this chat rolling‚Äî*what's one time management trick you've tried that actually helps you work smarter, not harder?* Drop your stories or struggles. Who knows, you might inspire someone (or get inspired) here. üòâ",1,1740606349.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

## Understanding the Standard Sony WH-1000XM4 Warranty

The first thing to understand is the standard warranty that comes with your new Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. Typically, Sony offers a limited warranty on its products, including these headphones. The sony wh-1000xm4 warranty period is generally one year from the original date of purchase. This warranty covers manufacturing defects and malfunctions that occur under normal use.

What does ""normal use"" mean? It generally encompasses issues like the headphones not powering on,a speaker failing,or a button malfunctioning due to a manufacturing flaw. It doesn't usually cover accidental damage, like dropping your headphones in water or crushing them in your bag. The sony wh-1000xm4 warranty coverage is specific, so carefully review the warranty documentation that came with your headphones.

To take advantage of the sony wh-1000xm4 warranty claim process, you'll need to provide proof of purchase, such as your receipt or online order confirmation. Keep this document in a safe place! You'll also likely need to describe the problem you're experiencing in detail. This documentation is crucial for initiating a sony warranty service request.

I started at 10mg and worked up to 50 mg. At 50mg I started noticing constipation issues and thought it was due to increased dehydration even though I was drinking 2.3L of water so maybe also a depletion of electrolytes? Please note I was also drinking one cup of coffee daily and using Zyn alongside the med. (Side note, I have been drinking coffee and using Zyn/nicotine for at least a decade to self-medicate before getting on medication) Before going any further, it‚Äôs important to note that I have always had 1-2 easy bowel movements a day. 

Anyways, after starting to experience constipation at the higher dose of medication, I decided to stop all 3 of the stimulants. I noticed the constipation did not resolve, even when taking stimulant laxatives like Dulcolax. I even tried adding coffee back in and that didn‚Äôt help! I have tried everything known to man, miralax, drinking electrolyte water, magnesium citrate, epsom salt flushes, enemas, castor oil, prunes and prune juice, exercise and walking, triphala, fiber, psyllium husks, you name it, I‚Äôve tried it! I even fasted for 4 days thing that would help reset the gut and it did nothing! I am at my wits end! I‚Äôm wondering if the stimulant caused some type of GP even though I have been off of that and coffee for almost a week now. My gut feels, paralyzed, for lack of a better word. Dulcolax worked once and when it did, I didn‚Äôt get the usual feelings of my bowels moving that I typically have in the past when using laxatives. The only thing that seems to work more often than not is when I pop a Zyn (nicotine) in.

However, I quit coffee and nicotine for two weeks before I ever tried Vyvanse and I was still able to have normal bowel movements so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs being caused from the cessation of those two. It seemed to only happen towards the tail end of me using the stimulant. I feel like the stimulant messed with my dopamine/seratonin levels somehow (fight or flight, vagus nerve stuff) but even now that I‚Äôm off the stimulant, I‚Äôm horribly backed up and my gut feels straight up paralyzed! I will be seeing a doctor soon to run some gut tests but can any Reddit scientists here help me understand why the stimulant seems to have caused this issue?! Also, is there any hope I will go back to normal in time or anything I can do to help my body regulate again after this?

For context, my stools are not dry and hard when I do pass them, probably cuz I‚Äôm taking ungodly amounts of mag citrate and vitamin c and stuff. It‚Äôs more a feeling like that bowels refuse to move the stool along which is why I‚Äôm posting in this sub. Thank you in advance!üôè",1,1740606083.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

1iyz3w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iyz3w7/the_way_hes_changed_since_we_broke_up_is_so_weird/,The way he‚Äôs changed since we broke up is so weird,"He broke up with me a month ago after 2 years, a week before he said he wanted a break. He became completely avoidant, even on our last night together before the break he was hateful and physically aggressive towards me. Got my hopes up during the break and said I could come to his gig to see him play only to cancel the day before and tell him he doesn‚Äôt want me there and telling me if I did show up he‚Äôd tell his parents we broke up. Just became so mean, I poured my heart out to him and loved him despite his behaviour towards me. After the breakup he called me high at 4am saying weird and disturbing stuff, juts not very nice at all. So crazy how we used to be so great together. He used to be so sweet and gentle with me. Since the breakup we met for coffee and closure and he genuinely couldn‚Äôt care less about me and looked fed up to even be with me. He just talked about how he‚Äôs happy to move on and if he saw another girl he liked he would get her number and that he didn‚Äôt love me as much as I loved him. We‚Äôd text a bit after and I thought it was going okay but he‚Äôd just breadcrumb me. One of the last texts I got was him saying he had a sex dream about me then ghosting me. It‚Äôs been over a week since then and he just hasn‚Äôt texted me since. He uses Snapchat a lot now and I‚Äôve noticed his snap score goes up all the time now. He barely even used it when we were dating. He also posted on his Instagram story the other night and it was a photo of him, 2 guys and a girl. And when I say he hardly used Instagram when we were together I mean that, he never even posted anything at all when we were dating. 
It‚Äôs so strange to me that he doesn‚Äôt care despite everything I‚Äôve been through with him. He used to be so sweet and now I don‚Äôt even recognise him. Why do they suddenly just instantly change after the breakup. The old him would be so disappointed, I thought we had such a deep connection and understanding of eachother ",2,1740606037.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1iyz3r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1iyz3r7/ssp_troubles/,SSP troubles,So I‚Äôve had a fellow ode Gen 2 for about few months and decided to upgrade to the SSP MP burrs. I got them already used for about 5 pounds so preseasoned basically. I knew they give great clarity but can be unforgiving but I gotta say - I‚Äôve been struggling to get the cups I was hoping for. Taste keeps coming across as over extracted and I‚Äôm going more course to compensate but my brew times for 15g are anywhere in the early 2 minute range now and I‚Äôm still not quite getting the clarity I‚Äôm looking for. That time is even with the melodrip for everything past my bloom. Any one else go through this with their SSP?

nothing can be seen...

nothing can be heard...

Terror shines like a beam...

Through the herd...

You can laugh, you can cry...

But you won't die with your dirty lie...

( A deep, cold voice was reciting this.)

Wow , your skin is so soft...

What a Shame. 

Why did you have to piss him off?

_ Please , give me more time...I'll hold up my end... 
( A beaten man said with a shakey voice.
He was tied to a chair)

My client is , cruel. You had your chance...
Now , enjoy the consequences.

_  please Don't...give me a Fucking day!.


Do one thing for me...

Close your eyes.

I got a surprise for you!.


...

DO IT!.

( He couldn't stop the tears. And he couldn't do anything about this. He was simply, too late.
He shut his eyes out of weakness.

He could hear the shadowy figure walk over to the light switch to turn on the rest of the lights.

The whole basement was now illuminating with a nightmare...)

Open them!. And enjoy the view...

( The man hesitantly opened his eyes...
What he saw , was worse than having every single bone in his body break at once. Worse than any possible death ever...
He saw his family...
Parts.
Parts of his family laying on a table...

With their faces hanging from the celling waiting to be dryed out and wearable...

Wearable for him...

He started screaming frantically. He was jumping in and out of his seat , but he couldn't get out.
His muscles were swelling.

Pain , rage and despair were taking over him.

He was turning hollow.

He screamed to the point where his vocal cords gave out.

He was passing out.

The figure just watched.

It didn't do anything.)

You'll sleep here tonight. Tomorrow we are going to learn about spelling... Good night.

( Then, it left upstairs)

(Title cardüî•)


He watched as the SWAT team destroyed everything he had built.

Those poor kids shivering behind him.

His followers running around like a lost herd without their Shepard.

Their naked bodies slamming into each other with force.

He looked at the man who took away his power.

A smile. A smile appeared on his lips.

They were safe.

That's what mattered...



Cole saw Jake come out of the cafeteria, still wearing the robe...
he immediately got tased with a taser gun. 
He couldn't do anything. Jake fell and hit his head hard on the floor, immediately passing out.

Cole got off the stage to go check on Jake.

A perfect opportunity for one of our rockstars to disappear...

After all , he did his job perfectly...

Cole ran , pushing anyone that got in his way on the floor.

Until he ran into him... Charlie.

CJ_ great Job sergeant...

C_ Charlie get the fuck out of my way...
They fucking tased the kid!.

CJ_ WHAT?! Why?

( Cole ran to Jake's unconscious body and tried his best to wake him up...by slapping him.)

C_ He's not waking up!.

CJ_ Why the fuck is he wearing a robe?!
Cole , what have you done?

C_...

CJ_ I'm talking to you ass-wipe!.

C_ I tried to stop him, but he really wanted to help... So...

CJ_ HE WAS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!...WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU...

C_ please save it for later. 

Wait...

( He looked back at the stage...
The poor victims were shivering from fear and he was gone!.)

where the fuck did Milo go? Oh shit!.

CJ_ oh Come on...

C_ Get those kids out of here, and wake him up!.


Cole ran back to the room where by coming out of, he kicked off this whole chaos.
It was winding down a little at this point.
He found a hatch that was supposedly hidden In one of the cells...
It was open.
He descended into the abyss.
Suddenly Cole found himself in a sewer of sorts.
His dirty boots were now even more dirty.
He saw a silhouette. He could hear footsteps splashing In the nasty water.
They both started running.
Cole then yelled:
 "" STOP RUNNING YOU COWARD.
SURRENDER!.""
He was running out of breath...
Cole could hear giggling...
He reached the end of the shit tunnel and there she was...
A distraction.
Her giggling continued.
""All hail Heresy...""
She reached into her pockets and before she could do anything with the Poison ,Cole shot her in the arm.
Spilling it in the process...
""NO!!!!"" She screeched and lunged at Cole.
The magnum's bullet should have pushed her back many steps. She shouldn't be even able to walk or talk after that... That's what he was thinking while getting hit again and again.
Cole was able to kick her off and cuff her afterwards.

"" I'LL EAT YOU ALIVE!!!."" She yelled.

"" Trust me honey, many want to"" he said calmly.

After he cuffed her , she calmed down.
Could she break through this? 
he thought...
Why isn't she?



He climbed his way back upstairs with her on his shoulder. She didn't make a noise. She didn't resist at all. Something is wrong...

Once he got up he could hear cheering...

"" SERGEANT!

 SERGEANT!

 SERGEANT! ""

Charlie was the only one frowning.

Even she started chanting.

CJ_ Who the hell is she?

C_ A goddamn distraction...

"" Nice to meet ya!"" She giggled.

CJ_ He got away?

C_ Yeah... we'll get him. Send out a report.

CJ_ I already have.

C_ Wow thank you for having faith in me...

CJ_ fuck off Cole... we'll talk back at the station.

C_ Where is Jake?

CJ_ I took care of him ,and the hostages.

"" THEY WERE SACRIFICES YOU MORON!. For him..."" She shouted.

C_ Shut her up please.

 ( He handed her to Charlie)

I'll see you back at the station. 
...

Oh before I go, did any of you guys find a shotgun anywhere?

( One of the Swats gave the gun back with a broken heart.)




Cole went on a drive with no specific
 destination in mind.

He drove and drove until he felt hungry...
He thought about going to a diner.
He went to a bar instead.

Once he got inside, the first thing that caught his attention besides the British flags on the wall , was the television. It was old. Cole liked it. An episode of ""Vesper: the animated series"" was on.
His favourite...
The one where vesper confronts The horrifying 
"" FRIGHTRAVEN""

He leaned on the bar and admired the TV.
Admired the show.
Admired his memories with them.
The TV had all of his attention that he didn't even notice the little boy sitting on a barrel of wine, Glued to the TV just like he was.

Eventually the bartender came out of the backroom.



Bartender _ Oh my goodness!!!. You gave me quite a scare there my good sir!. What can I help you with?

C_ you serve wine? 

B_  Oh god. Could you please lower your voice...
I don't want the wrong person to hear us .To get the wrong idea, you know what I mean?

C_ I understand. Now could you please answer the question. ( He whispered mockingly)

B_ Yes I do , would you want a glass?

C_ That would be lovely.

( Cole continued to watch the show with the boy.)

B_ Do you like this show?

C_ Yeah. I used to read the novels with my father.

B_ Oh my ! Novels you say? How extraordinary...
 Like reading on an actual piece of paper?

C_ he had them from his childhood.

B_ Brilliant!. 
My boy makes me watch the show every night with him!.

C_ you bring your son here often?

B_ sometimes, how so?

C_ isn't that your boy on the barrel? 

( Cole pointed at nothing.)

B_ You must be already drunk my good sir! Hahaha.

C_ Shit. yeah... probably.

B_ here you go. I'm in the back if you needed anything.

C_ thank you.

( The boy faced him. Their eyes connected for a few seconds then he watched the TV again.
Cole was now watching the show with his son.
Until the bartender returned to take the barrel away.

He had once again forgotten to take his pills)




Light was creeping through the tiny window he had opened up with his eye lids.
The surrounding noises were all of a sudden attacking his ears.
Sounds of laughter, fear , hope and anger...

His head was about to explode at any moment.

Thoughts were forming...

He was dehydrated and hungry. Very hungry.

He decided to open his windows a bit wider...

And by doing so he was able to observe the room.  He was free of the robes , he noticed.

He felt comfortable and cozy.

And the smell was coming to him as well...
It was to die for... Freshly picked flowers and freshly baked pies. That's how he could describe it. And then he saw the flowers on the desk.

The couch he found himself on felt better than any bed he had ever laid in.

Multiple blinks later and he still felt like crap.

The blinds were down and yet he felt as if someone was watching him , but no one was inside the room.

There was a picture frame on his desk , but the back of it was facing our sleepyhead.

He blinked once more , and he was there again.
In the middle of them...

He couldn't breathe. Panic. All he could do was to panic.

His nightmare went away when someone opened the door to the room.

It was Charlie. He looked annoyed and tired.

CJ_ How you feeling kid? You good?

J_ I feel horrible...
How long was I out for?

CJ_ it's 5 pm. 

J_ Oh my...

CJ_ Why were you wearing their robe?

J_ I...wanted to help. I had no idea...we had no idea that it would lead to...

CJ_ you're ok now son. You were brave today...
But you must be more careful from now on...

J_ Thank you sir , I'll sure try.

CJ_ You want coffee?

J_ That would be lovely thank you.

CJ_ Then go into the kitchen and make some for me too!.
( A mischievous grin appeared on his face)

J_ Oh , uh of course. How do you like yours?

CJ_ I'm joking. I already had my 4 cups today...
You can go home if you want. You've already done enough.

J_ Is sergeant frost back?

CJ_ No. I've called him multiple times but he doesn't pick up. How so?

J_ Um , have you interviewed anyone yet?

CJ_ No?

J_ I was wondering if...we could conduct the interview.

CJ_ (sigh) Why not. You've already done the hard part might as well interview them yourself.

J_ How many did we capture exactly?

CJ_ Too many to count. Many of them have been questioned already don't worry...

J_ What did you learn?

CJ_ Not much...many of them said that they only joined for the ""activities"" and nothing else.
While some of them are bad shit insane.
Most thought it was just a roleplaying thing apparently...I find that hard to believe.

J_ Their leader... Is he still here?

CJ_ yeah. The transfers are due in two days.

J_  Have you questioned him?

CJ_ I'm waiting for Cole to show up.

J_ Can I join you two?

CJ_ I need to speak to cole about that, but you can watch if you want.

J_ Thank you.

CJ_ Hey , go home for tonight kid. Trust me we won't do anything without you.

J_ isn't there anything else I can help with?

CJ_ There is , get some well deserved rest.


Jake nodded and Charlie left.
He sat there on cole's couch for a few more minutes before deciding to head home.



Cole was sitting on his bathroom's floor underneath the shower head getting soaked while having all of his clothes on.

He hated himself for doing so...

His entire body was on fire.

Out of rage.

Out of fear.

Out of desperation.

He turned the shower off and took all of his clothes off.

A week from now is their anniversary.

But he had completely forgotten. At least he tried to...

He forgot to buy a gift.

After drying himself with a towel , he got dressed.

His phone was dead and he wasn't planning on charging it anytime soon.

He went outside and sat on his porch and enjoyed the sunset.

Was his Nightshift job gonna intertwine with his regular job? He wondered.

She wasn't normal and that bothered him.

He decided to go on a walk. To clear his head.



The elevator door opened and there she was.

Standing next to the open window at the end of the hallway smoking.

Jake stood outside hoping that she hasn't noticed him. He took out his keys and walked towards his apartment.

""So how was it?"" She asked.

""I've never been more afraid in my life...it was alright."" Jake responded.

She smirked and enjoyed the rest of her cigarette.

"" Do you want one?""

"" Sure...""

Nightfall was creeping up on the them.

They both looked out the window...

One dreaming about their future 
And the other fearing it...

Jake wanted to ask her why she was smoking again , but he didn't have the courage to.
Instead he asked her about her day.

Jake looked miserable.

They chatted for a little bit until her phone rang.
It was Casey. She answered.
No matter how many times he had said he is going to move on...
one look at her would make his knees weak.
He noticed something though...
Something that gave him hope.
She wasn't enjoying herself speaking with Casey.
She also looked miserable.



Cole woke up twenty minutes ahead of his alarm in a pool of his own sweat.
He made sure to take them this time.

After putting on a nice shirt and his jacket made of corduroy, he made his coffee and poured it into a flask and brought it along with him.
He looked at his phone, all charged up now , and saw the miss calls.

""I'm fucked.""

Then he left for another day of work.

He entered the precinct and looked inside of Charlie's room. It was empty.
He didn't waste anytime and went inside his office. Where Charlie was waiting for him...

C_ Oh shit...

CJ_ Good morning sergeant...

C_ Look man , I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean to ghost you, my phone was dead and I was away...

CJ_ congratulations on your bust.

C_ What?

CJ_ That's what they want me to tell you.

C_ Who's they?

CJ_ You've made the case of the year they said...

C_ Ok?... We good?

CJ_ of course. Of course.

C_ Listen I had no idea what was going on down there when I sent that kid.
He wasn't even supposed to be in the damn building!.

CJ_ He is ok now. That's what matters. Not the what ifs. 

C_ This isn't like you. Why aren't you mad? You're freaking me out.

CJ_ Because mister Kimberly himself came here to congratulate you...
he went to use the rest room.
Just wait till he's out of here...
Then I'll tell you what I really think.

C_ ok , I was just being nice before... The fuck do you want from me? He is my partner right?
This is his JOB!. Get your head out the fucking gutter.

CJ_ It's not about that. You handed him an unlicensed gun.

C_ I have a license for that shit.

CJ_ he doesn't... And because of you , he could have died. The concussion he received could have fucking killed him!. I didn't tell him this but he was really lucky. If he would have hit his head a little harder, just a little harder...

C_ I didn't fucking tase him now did I?
It was stupid of him to still have the robes on after the whole place got raided!.


CJ_ Behave yourself Cole... Don't embarrass us Infront of Kimberly.

C_ Aye aye.
Were you able to find anything on Milo?

CJ_ Nope... nothing. We checked everywhere he could have been. It's like he has disappeared from existence completely.

C_ Shit...



 Cole sat on his couch and waited while Charlie was judging him.
The old man entered the room eventually...
With his guards waiting outside.
He had a cane and a problematic back.
His face... something about it rubbed cole the wrong way...it made his skin crawl.
Alot happened because of him.
He was one of the few people in the government who still supported the police.
He looked friendly and incredibly fragile from afar.
But don't let his friendliness fool you...
He was vicious in war.
""No mercy for the ones against change"" was his campaign's slogan.
He meant it.

His eyes were delighted to see Cole finally show up.
He shook his hand very elegantly.
Cole just wanted for him and Charlie to leave his office.
"" I believe you're up for a promotion sir!.
You deserve much more.
Taking down an entire cult operation all by yourself...incredible!."" He said proudly.

Cole was lost for words.

Then he faced Charlie and asked him if he had a lieutenant...

CJ_ We did...she , passed away a few years back...

K_ Oh I'm so sorry to hear that... Anyhow...
He would make a great lieutenant!...hell maybe we should make him captain!...hahaha.

C_ Uh , thank you sir truly, but there is no need for any promotions...I like where I'm at.
I'm just doing my job. And trust me , captain Jonesy is the best captain I've ever worked with.

K_ If everyone was as humble as you are , this world would have been a sanctuary.
I've heard alot about you and your work sergeant. You have accomplished great things.
So You deserve great things.

C_ Thank you for coming here today.

K_ I would love to thank you publicly, if you were to show up at this weekend's event we are throwing.

C_ I don't want to disappoint you sir , but I'm afraid I'm busy by then...

K_ I'm sure you will be... Trust me when I say this sergeant Frost, good things are coming your way.
Charlie as usual it was a delight chatting with you, if you needed anything call me.
You have my full support.

CJ_ Thank you Gary. It's always nice to see an old friend.

K_ by the way, while I was reading up on you , I saw that you were...banned from homicide...
I hereby lift the ban. Well , I still have to do a couple of things before it's fully lifted but , it will be.

C_  sir do you know why I was banned?

K_ it doesn't matter. It's lifted. Have a good day everyone.

( He shook both their hands and rejoined his guards and left.)

C_ What a fucking prick.

CJ_ Tell me about it. But , he said he wants to support us. I'll say we let him...
I'm going to make a list.

C_ He got persuaded too quickly. One no , and he was done. Fuck me I guess.

CJ_ What is your answer then? Do you want the post? Cuz after what you've done yesterday I'm not sure I want to give it to you anymore...

C_ Screw you. Can you leave now?

CJ_ We are both gonna leave.

C_ What now?

CJ_ Jake is waiting for us at interview room 6.
The girl you caught.

C_ I don't like the sound of that. Couldn't you just say, arrested?

CJ_ Yeah I guess it sounds a little weird but you did capture her...

C_ You're making it worse.

CJ_ whatever, c'mon let's go.

C_ Do we have to do it now?

CJ_ Yes , she isn't the only one we're doing today either...

C_ ok you gotta be doing that on purpose.

CJ_ Doing what?

C_ Making your sentences sound nasty...
If this is a new form of punishment, I gotta say it's working really well.

CJ_ Shut up.


Jake was standing behind the see through mirror and watched her.
She was beautiful he thought.
She looked so innocent and lovely.
Looked...
""Too bad she is a criminal..."" He said in despair.
The monitors they had in the room were at least a decade old.
He sipped on his coffee.
Hated the taste.
He missed the agency...
Cole and Charlie had finally arrived.




J_ Good morning sergeant, captain.

C_ morning kid , how are you doing?

J_ I'm doing well , thanks for asking.

CJ_ Who do you want to take with Cole?

J_ I can observe if thats something you'd want.

C_ I'll take the kid inside. It can be an experience for him.

CJ_  I'll monitor you then.

C_ Alright...
You've done one of these before?

J_ Yes, I have done many.
Don't worry sir.

C_ How do you wanna do it?

J_ Captain told me about her a little...
She seems to be, lost from reality.
So I have no idea...

C_ Yeah me too , guess we'll figure it out when we're there.

CJ_ I sent her file to your tablets, Good luck.



They entered the room and she immediately started smiling ear to ear, like a child whose parent has just come home.
Her eyes and ears were widened.
Joy was overwhelming her...
Jake was a little freaked out.
So was Cole, he just didn't let it show.
He sat down on the chair facing her , and Jake leaned on the wall.

C_ Margaret Keefer , 26 years old. Daughter of Philip and Samantha Keef...


Suddenly cole was held back by what he has just seen... purple dots that weren't there before...all over her face. Some of which were shaping as he was reading her name...
Then she put her tongue out... It was completely blue.
Whatever that was wrong with her , she was proud of it.


C_ Jake. Leave. Leave this room right now.

J_ What? Why? 

C_ I said leave. Right now!.

(She giggled to herself as Jake was leaving...)

C_ Charlie, don't let Jake back inside...



Jake went back to Charlie , searching for any answers...


CJ_ son , leave. This just got more complicated. Trust me you don't want any of this headache.

J_ Can you at least tell me what's going on?
You guys gave her a lollipop or something?

CJ_ Not now.

J_ fine...


 Jake's curiosity was overtaking his soul.
He walked back to his desk wondering what this thing was all about.
He sat there and read her file again and again.
Nothing that would imply that reaction...
After what felt ages cole came out of the room...
Jake could hear her laughing through the walls.

He saw cole going to Charlie and speaking with him...
He couldn't understand a word they were saying.
Cole looked devastated.
Eventually he went to Jake.
He masked his devastation away...
Charlie went in her room.

C_ C'mon kid.let's go. The leader awaits.



Like nothing had happened...


J_ What was that all about?

C_ Nothing.

J_ Then why did you kick me out?

C_ it doesn't concern you.

J_ But we're partners!. I must know what that was abo...( Cole interrupted him)

C_  Goddamn it kid!.
 Listen, I'll say this once so don't you ever forget it...
We are not partners, you are not my partner.
You're my punishment, don't you ever forget that...

J_ Oh...

C_ Don't make it any more agonising than it already is. That's all I'm asking for...

J_ Fine.

C_ Good , now follow me.


As they walked through the hallway to the leader's room , Jake couldn't help but to feel disappointed and a little heartbroken.
He said to himself: 
""I'll make him regret saying that...""
 Over and over again to make himself feel a little better, even though he knew he wasn't going to do anything about it.

The leader was already being monitored by an observer. Cole and Jake went inside...
The old man was weak and tired.
He looked sad , and yet so happy at the same time.
His left eye was scratched out of it's socket.
Jake had only now noticed that.

Cole began the interview:

C_ My name is detective sergeant Cole Frost and this here, is detective Jakob Mathew mccaghy.
We are here to ask you some questions and after we're done, you can go back to your little cell for the night.

The Great Leader_ Well hi , detective sergeant.

C_ Why do you have that grin on your face?

TGO_ I'm just happy to be here.

J_ Upon scanning your face , nothing came up.
Who are you? What is your name?

TGO_ I have no name. And I have no will.
I'm only here to lead under him.

J_ Who is he?

TGO_ HERESY...

C_ What is your relationship with detective Avalon?

TGO_ Never heard of him.

J_ He didn't specify any gender...

C_ hmm. Listen pal , my patience is, at an all time low...so please, don't make this harder.

TGO_ (Sigh) I didn't know he was a detective...
He came to us about a year ago.

C_ He was standing on the podium with you...
I'm guessing you were very close.

TGO_ He was very handy.

C_ That's the first time anyone has ever said that about him...

( Cole read more of the reports about Milo)

C_ We've searched his apartment , there were writings all over the walls.
( He showed him the pictures)

TGO_ These are our prayers...

J_ Looks more like curses to me.

TGO_ Do you know if he is safe?

C_ No?... Why are you asking?

TGO_ Because he wasn't supposed to escape!.

J_ Wait, you guys wanted to be captured on purpose...

TGO_ Yes...

C_ Why?

TGO_ my god is a cruel man... Even if you can call him that.
I've seen him do things.
Terrible things.

J_ Why worship him in the first place then?

TGO_ Like I said, I'm only here to lead under him...I don't have any memories before that.
I don't know...

J_ You were really going to kill those kids for him?

TGO_ Sacrifice not kill , get that right son. And yes , I must do anything he wants... Or else he'll show his wrath upon me and my people ...
 He loves others suffrage...

C_ Don't you mean his people?

TGO_ He doesn't care about us...we are small to him.
He promised to make us ascend. Ascending to further beyond...
But then he kept demanding. More and more...
Until he wanted us to dance in the blood of his chosens.

C_ How did you get your hands on the ""sacrifices"", Most of them weren't from around here...

TGO_ A pilot. Milo received them from a pilot by the name of peralta. Roger peralta.

C_ Well thank you for that.

TGO_ Listen to me , sergeant please...
Bad things are going to happen very soon...
And when it does happen...
I don't want me and my people to be outside...
Give us life sentences if you have to. Please I'm begging you...
(The old man started tearing up.)

C_ In order for Milo to leave an evidence for us , he got a friend of mine killed by using one of your followers. So don't worry...
I'll make sure you never see the outside world ever again.

TGO_ He wasn't supposed to kill anyone...
what are you talking about?



C_ Just like when he wasn't supposed to escape...he has done alot of things he's not supposed to don't you think?

Jake, look up this peralta.

J_ On it...

( Cole then left ahead of Jake.
Right before Jake could take a step outside the old man said something that shook him...)

TGO_ Sean Mathew Mccaghy.

J_ what?

TGO_ hmm?

J_ What did you just say?

TGO_ His name. His first victim As far as I know...
You asked if I would kill for him.
It's the only option.
He taught me. He showed me what happens if I don't.
What was your name again?

J_ How do you know his name?

TGO_ I...He made me. And yet , he still took my eye.haha.

J_ You? You? What? No wait...it was you?

TGO_ he gave me the title "" THE GREAT ONE"" Afterwards. He said I proved my loyalty...
He said what I've done was enough.
He lied.
He asked...
And asked again and again for more and more...
I couldn't anymore.

C_ C'mon Jake let's get out of here.

TGO_ Jake , he showed me your picture...
He begged me. To make it fast. But he wanted the pain to last...

C_ Don't say his name you son of a bitch. C'mon let's go...

J_ You killed my father?

TGO_ inorder to live, you must die.
Inorder to breathe you MUST SUFFOCATE!.
I'm so sorry...I don't want to live...please kill me...
DO IT!. DO IT!!!.
IT MUST BE YOU... release me of my pain.
I beg you.
Just like he begged me.

C_ Look at me. Look at me boy , don't look at him. C'mon.



He took Jake's hands and took him outside.
Cole's back almost gave out from Jake's resistance. But ultimately, he was successful.
Jake was lost in the void ,that was his thoughts.
Until he heard a familiar voice showing concern... It was her. The girl he lost.

K_ Jake , oh my god are you okay? I saw everything. I'm so sorry.

J_ Katie?

K_ I'm here.

( He hugged her with teary eyes.)

C_ Take a seat. Do you want some water?

J_ No. thanks.

""YOU MUST KILL ME !. YOU. YOU CAN FREE ME... PLEASE"" He screamed as the officers were bringing him back to his coup.

C_ Let's go on a drive. I know a place.
Detective Raven right?

K_ Yes sir.

C_ can you please inform the captain about what happened here.

K_ Of course.


 Cole nodded and left with Jake.
Before entering the elevator, Jake looked back at her. Their eyes had a conversation.
And before he knew it ,he was in his car.
Cole was talking to him but he couldn't listen.
It wasn't his music this time either.
His mind wasn't there.
It was in that room.
It was thinking about that day.
The day he vanished.
His mother sobbing...
His school bag on the floor.
And the note.
He blinked. They had arrived.
From the outside the place looked dead.
But through the windows, you could see life.



He took a step inside. His eyes started to shine.
The smell made him hungry.
The lighting gave him hope.
The decorations made him feel nostalgic.
Warm. He felt warm.
The cold was going away.
His mind was back with him.
Good memories with his father started to pour in his brain.
He had forgotten just how much he missed him.
How much time they were robbed.
"" He would have liked this place..."" He said to himself.
The owners hugged Cole. They were happy to see him again.
They kindly seated them.

"" Welcome to the canyon!"" The waitress said soothingly.


C_ Thank you Wendy.

W_ What can I get ya?

C_ Walk a cow through the garden with dirty water no yum yum this time,and make it moo. Thank you. What do you want kid? It's on me.

( Jake just looked at Cole in disbelief.)

C_ Kid what do you want?

J_ Oh uh , do you have coffee? And waffles.

W_  anything else?

J_ no thank you.

C_ Thanks.

( Wendy left)

J_ Where did you learn all that?

C_ I picked them up from my old man.
He brought me here actually. For my birthday.
I hated it at first...but then , I fell in love with it.

J_ ""The canyon"". Like the grand canyon?

C_ Yup. Before they destroyed it.

J_ How can that even happen?

C_ With enough bombs anything can happen.
You ok?

J_ Yeah. Better now. Thank you for taking me here.

( Cole nodded)

C_ Do you want to talk about it?

J_ I...don't know...

C_ When I lost my dad , I lost a part of me. A part that I loved. My childhood. I felt the warmth of it disappear.
I understand.

J_ I thought...I didn't know he was killed.
I came back home from school, and saw my mom on the floor sobbing unstoppably.
He left us a note. Apologized for what he had done to himself. I didn't know how to feel...how to react. I was twelve. I just ran.
Until I was in a park.
My mom found me hours later. With the help of an officer. His words comforted me.
Because of him , I went into the agency program.

C_ I was in college. Received a text telling me he is on his death bed. He was the strongest man I knew...I just couldn't see him like that.
I was selfish. I eventually decided to go back , but it was too late. He was gone. And i was a coward.

J_ I'm sure...they are proud of us.

C_ Here's hoping.

( Cole and Jake chatted a little bit more)

W_ Here is your order. Enjoy!.

C_ Thank you sweetheart.

( They were both enjoying their meals until Cole received a call. It was Charlie.
He answered:)

C_ Hey...oh shit, alright we're on it.

Kid c'mon we gotta go to the airport.
Hey Wendy sweetheart, could you give'em legs.

J_ What's up?

C_ It's Peralta. He has a flight here in 5 hours.

J_ But the airport is on the other side of...

C_ That's why we are going now , c'mon.
You go on ahead and get in the car. Don't touch anything!.

J_ alright...thank you.









Good morning Thomas. Did you sleep well last night?
I hope you did.

T_ Please...just kill me...


Don't talk like that... 
Now , just relax and learn.

( The figure got to work. He chose his favorite utensil out of the many he had in his bag.
And slowly approached the bodies on the table. Touching them lightly. Caressing their skin like a mother. And then...RIP , SLASH , SLICE , CUT.
He chose his favorite parts and glued  them on the wall in front of Thomas.)


T_ NOOOOO... LEAVE THEM ALONE... PLEASE!!!.


But they want this. They've died for this.


T_ GO TO HELL YOU SICK FUCK. FUCK YOU AND YOUR FUCKING BOSS.

( The entity took his oldest daughter's mask off the rack, and put it on Thomas's face.
Then they proceeded to put on the his wife's mask.)


Please Thomas, don't bother him. Let him work in peace.

Yeah dad. Please just sit tight and let the man work.

T_ you motherfucker...
( He said defeatedly.)


Get it all out.

Say your final words honey before you join us.

( His wife came back to life through the mask .)



( It took time. Decades. As he watched the artist creat their piece , all of his bones broke.
He was dead in the head.
Just a slab of meat left.)

We are a few pieces short...
Honey do you mind?

( Blacking out. The only way to escape the excruciating pain he was in after losing an arm , and a leg.)


Thank you dad. You're the best.

( The artist revealed their art to the husk.

All the letters he took spelled:

H-E-R-E-S-Y

He walked towards the man and took the mask off of the husk.
Then gifted him an out.
A knife to the throat.

""Darkness...

Nothing can be seen...

Nothing can be heard...

Terror shines like a beam...

Through the herd...

You can laugh, you can cry...

But you won't die with your dirty lie...""

He recited as he was cutting himself a new mask.)

I've just reached 49 hours! So far I've survived for 18 days and Here are some screenshots of the most memorable moments for me in order! 
.
Chose the MT Spawn. 
.
Evening of day 6: I finally got a grasp of the interior decorating  system, I've destroyed some furniture here and there without knowing their potential, but this is the first time I made Grey Mother's house comfy! 
.
Evening of day 11: My first ever aurora! I ended up going to bed too early so I'm turn I woke up too early and to my surprise the electronics in my house were flickering and when I stepped outside there she was! I don't think death could get any more beautiful. The ambiance for the aurora while outside sure was scary! 
.
Morning of day 11: Milton Basin! I was out looking for the hunting rifle and I gotta admit I was a little under-prepared hehe....I climbed down and spent a good time mapping the area, garething resources and finding packs with supplies. Those two consecutive rope climbs sure look manageable at first, but I ended up having to spend the night and half a day in the basin just to gather enough stamina to climb out! Safe to say whatever down there isn't worth the stamina usage. After I was out I was spent and took the rest of the day off to restore my fatigue bar.
.
Day 18: I mustered up the courage to leave Milton to find the Hunting Rifle, food items were becoming scarce and had to start hunting to eat . The journey was relatively easy, I found a flare gun and now I know better and always bring some cups of coffee to help me with the climbs. I made it into Solid sna-I mean, Jerry, the trapper's cabin and to My amazement and surprise there she was, lying on the rack with all its beauty! The trip was well worth it as I have some rounds I left at home. Might stay in Mystery Lake to bring some extra stuff home so I can spend some extra days in milton before I have to go on a supply run.

On a Side note I would've mentioned when I got the revolver between days 1-3, but I wanna draw a comic about it since I've found the revolver in a safe in Milton's credit union and some time mid week 1 I went to St. Christopher's church to find a single bullet lying on the preacher's podium with a survival knife lodged on the side and I have this headcanon about a priest/religious survivor (maybe a Milton resident ?)

It's based in a small town in current times (back in 2010-2019). The main character was a red haired woman who is described as average looking but with this beautiful hair. She meets this man in i believe a diner or coffee shop she works at and they hit it off. He's from out of town in like a big city (i can't remember his occupation). When she's not working she takes care of her mother who's sick with cancer i believe. Later on in the book they get engaged and she ends up cutting her hair into this pixie cut (key point). Later on in the book the main male character ends up cheating on the main female character with an ex lover. In the act he describes the ex lover as always being noisy when in the act but at that time she was being extra loud. The female main character finds them and still proceeds with the wedding. On the wedding day she finds out her mom has been lying about being sick and her mother goes crazy and holds her hostage with a gun and the main male character finds them and goes to protect the female main character and then the mother shoots and i believe he dies.

I have yet to try this, but just wanted to get this out there and see if my math is correct. **Roughly # of biscuits/4 = # of pods to use. Increase by 1 for above 6%**

I told my mom, if she won't stop the affair then she should leave the house and live with the guy, but she's still living with us and she's making our life a living hell everyday. I don't have a peace of mind for the past 6 months due to this. On top of that, my dad has been dumping all his problems with my mom on me since my mom wont still talk to him for 4 months now. Dad is in another country, he don't have a visa to go to the US yet. He kept asking me how is my mom doing, he's asking me if mom is still talking with the guy and all sorts of stuff. I feel so bad for my dad but at the same time it's taking a toll on my mental health. 

Recently, I found out the guy has been filling my mom's head with lies so she believes him rather than her own child. And found out that it's the guy who won't stop the affair with my mom. How do I get revenge on this asshole or to give him a sign to stop? I just wanna go to the store they work at (grocery store) and accidentally spill coffee on him to give him a lesson.

A few months ago, I bought a Timemore Sculpture 078s, planning to use it 50/50 for both filter coffee and espresso. However, lately, I‚Äôve been drinking more and more filter coffee, and I keep hearing great things about the turbo burrs of the 078.

I considered getting a set, but I still want to drink espresso and don‚Äôt want to swap burrs all the time. So, I started thinking about getting the standard 078 as a dedicated filter grinder. But that‚Äôs a big investment for me.

Then I came across a post where someone claimed that the Fellow Ode Gen 2 is almost as good as the 078 for filter, making the extra cost not worth it.

So now I‚Äôm curious‚Äîif my main goal is to improve my filter coffee, is it worth getting the 078 if I can afford it? Or would the Fellow Ode Gen 2 already be a significant upgrade over my 078s? Or is the difference between them not that big anyway?

1iyyrae,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1iyyrae/awakening_journey_caught_up_in_exbreakup/,Awakening journey caught up in ex/breakup,"Hello there‚Äî

Long story short, I am struggling in my awakening journey because it is intrinsically linked to my ex-gf and the pain of my breakup with her after a 1.5 year relationship.

To explain, I started dating my ex a couple years back, and at that time, I was already starting to deconstruct from a very rigid, dogmatic American Christian upbringing. I knew I had to move on from organized religion, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for, exactly. It turned out that this girl I was dating was already very far along in her journey of awakening, had experience in perceiving 5D, regular conversing with astral entities, spirit guides, etc. She slowly introduced me to this world, taught me how to meditate, and thus, was the catalyst of my spiritual journey.

But, we entered a long-distance period of the relationship, and I did not take it well. I was anxiously-attached, immature, and still not very far along on my path to waking up. I was clingy, overly emotional, and often egocentric and combative. Obviously, she was not perfect and had her roles to play as well, but I can only take responsibility for the ways I was not a very good partner. She eventually dumped me over Christmas, saying that I couldn't be allowed to bring down her vibration and impede her spiritual growth. She even went as so far as to block me on any and all communication channels.

I know that this is something I must accept and grow from‚ÄîThat I am meant to go through this suffering on my path to awakening. But it is difficult to accept what I have lost. I loved her very deeply, and I wish I had matured both spiritually and emotionally sooner so that growth didn't have to come at the cost of my relationship with her.

Eckhart Tolle often talks about how there is no ""past you."" There is only a past reflection of the unconscious state, and all that matters is being present in the eternal now. I recognize this to be true. But I often find myself thinking, when I close my eyes and focus on the present moment, that I wish I could share this ""now"" with her. The small moments that make life beautiful, I wish she was there too.

I know that if I forever rely on her (or anyone else) for my inner peace and joy, I will never have it, because those attachments are fleeting and riddled with complexities. But I also can't deny or suppress the light and warmth her presence brought into my life when she was here.

Also, because she was the one who started me down this path, she is, in a sense ""wrapped up"" in it...It's like how you feel bad going to the restaurant where you went on your first date, so you avoid going there. Or you might throw a certain coffee mug out because it makes you think of them. You try to do things be places that \*don't\* make you think of them, right? Well unfortunately for me, she was so central to the start of this journey for me, that often, me doing anything that has to do with spiritual development whether that be mediating, practicing presence of mind, reading an author like Tolle or Watts‚ÄîIt all calls her to mind.

1iyyqpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1iyyqpw/awakening_journey_caught_up_in_exbreakup/,Awakening journey caught up in ex/breakup,"Hello there‚Äî

Long story short, I am struggling in my awakening journey because it is intrinsically linked to my ex-gf and the pain of my breakup with her after a 1.5 year relationship.

To explain, I started dating my ex a couple years back, and at that time, I was already starting to deconstruct from a very rigid, dogmatic American Christian upbringing. I knew I had to move on from organized religion, but I wasn't sure what I was looking for, exactly. It turned out that this girl I was dating was already very far along in her journey of awakening, had experience in perceiving 5D, regular conversing with astral entities, spirit guides, etc. She slowly introduced me to this world, taught me how to meditate, and thus, was the catalyst of my spiritual journey.

But, we entered a long-distance period of the relationship, and I did not take it well. I was anxiously-attached, immature, and still not very far along on my path to waking up. I was clingy, overly emotional, and often egocentric and combative. Obviously, she was not perfect and had her roles to play as well, but I can only take responsibility for the ways I was not a very good partner. She eventually dumped me over Christmas, saying that I couldn't be allowed to bring down her vibration and impede her spiritual growth. She even went as so far as to block me on any and all communication channels.

I know that this is something I must accept and grow from‚ÄîThat I am meant to go through this suffering on my path to awakening. But it is difficult to accept what I have lost. I loved her very deeply, and I wish I had matured both spiritually and emotionally sooner so that growth didn't have to come at the cost of my relationship with her.

Eckhart Tolle often talks about how there is no ""past you."" There is only a past reflection of the unconscious state, and all that matters is being present in the eternal now. I recognize this to be true. But I often find myself thinking, when I close my eyes and focus on the present moment, that I wish I could share this ""now"" with her. The small moments that make life beautiful, I wish she was there too.

I know that if I forever rely on her (or anyone else) for my inner peace and joy, I will never have it, because those attachments are fleeting and riddled with complexities. But I also can't deny or suppress the light and warmth her presence brought into my life when she was here.

Also, because she was the one who started me down this path, she is, in a sense ""wrapped up"" in it...It's like how you feel bad going to the restaurant where you went on your first date, so you avoid going there. Or you might throw a certain coffee mug out because it makes you think of them. You try to do things be places that \*don't\* make you think of them, right? Well unfortunately for me, she was so central to the start of this journey for me, that often, me doing anything that has to do with spiritual development whether that be mediating, practicing presence of mind, reading an author like Tolle or Watts‚ÄîIt all calls her to mind. It's kind of ironic, I know.

I am sure there is a meaningful lesson that the Universe is trying to teach me in all this, but it is very difficult and painful. I wonder if anyone else can relate.",1,1740605104.0,SpiritualAwakening,1,1.0,False

I honestly can't think of one thing, and I would love to be wrong.

I feel stuck fracturing into ever more discrete and digital commodities. My attention, my feelings, my identity, my hobbies, my life in general. Maybe this is just getting older, but I'm being sucked into a recursive and self-perpetuating cycle where even my flailing attempts to find authenticity result in that newly sought authenticity becoming yet another commodity - one more thing the internet can offer to keep the cycle going.

""Just be your authentic self!"" What a fitting slogan given that we express ourselves through mass-produced items we buy - all those trendy t-shirts, hoodies, limited-edition sneakers, supposedly as unique as we are. Grab that smartwatch that's precisely expensive enough to signal status without screaming ""I'm insecure about my place in late capitalism."" Don the earbuds, smart rings, and various electronic appendages - congratulations, you're looking tech-bro chic! The algorithm - that same one those tech bros designed - approves!

Why is it so easy to recognize the mass delusion of consumption is unsustainable and self-destructive while actively participating in it? I can't even deal with my own shit, my solution for finding genuine human connection amid this wasteland? I post anonymously online, venting my frustrations to millions of strangers. In doing so, I further commodify myself, willingly feeding algorithms the information they need to not only understand me better but to identify and exploit these same inclinations in others just like me. My alienation becomes data becomes targeted advertising becomes someone else's alienation.

I specifically chose a t-shirt today (yes, the one that 20,000 other people in my state are wearing today) because it works. It genuinely does reflect some supposedly niche aspect of my personality. When someone complimented it earlier, it felt good. All thanks to psychological marketing geniuses like Edward Bernays who couldn't navigate a basic human conversation but somehow convinced an entire species that consumption and identity are synonymous concepts.

The cosmic joke of modern identity is that we've confused mass consumption with personality - millions of us streaming the same ""underground"" band, binge-watching identical ""niche"" shows, and maintaining elaborate parasocial relationships with celebrities who don't know we exist, all while convincing ourselves we've discovered something uniquely personal. We're simultaneously experiencing the same manufactured uniqueness, like shoppers who believe they've found something special in a mall where every store sells identical merchandise. Our social lives have been fractalized into endless consumption nodes - friendship is no longer sharing a single space but an economic circuit of coffee shops, boba caf√©s, and bars connected by rideshares, each extraction point skimming 20% off the top just for the privilege of human proximity.

Meanwhile, our inner lives have been thoroughly commodified - we outsource our emotional processing to therapists rather than ""burden"" friends (who are also paying someone else to listen to the same anxieties), medicate ourselves into functional units of production, and accept the fundamental absurdity of spending most of our waking hours staring at screens while pretending this is somehow a natural evolution of human existence.

Yesterday, I had just made a cup of coffee at my desk when I get a call saying one of my families needed some help with groceries. After a quick chat with my supervisor, we agreed that it would be appropriate in this situation due to factors I'm not going to state here. So I went to the store, got what they needed, and dropped it off. I sit back at my desk, ready to reheat the coffee I forgot, and got asked if I could help a coworker with another grocery drop off because they had to go out on an emergency. So I threw my coffee in a to go mug this time and went grocery shopping. Again. I dropped off the groceries then got back to my day.

I would feel this sensation when I clear my throat or cough. Then I started having diarrhea, and pain radiating to my right thigh. By the end of January, the tightness/pulling sensation was gone, and leg pain got better, but the whole right side of my abdomen now feels odd. It is a dull ache starting at the bottom of the right ribcage going down. It never goes away, it's constant. I'm not in any pain, it's just an uncomfortable discomfort, and when I press on the right side of my abdomen it's a bit tender, but I can't pinpoint where the pain is coming from exactly. It's almost March and I'm still feeling this discomfort, a long with diarrhea every day and some bloating. I changed my diet quite a lot and it seems to help dial down the discomfort a bit, but it's still there not going away at all. I did have coffee with coconut milk and I noticed after, the discomfort slightly increased, so I haven't been drinking coffee. I've also cut out gluten, dairy, breads, pastas, tomatoes, high fat foods. I don't eat any junk food, processed stuff, of fast food. I cook everyday...but anyways, has anyone experienced something like this where pain started in the lower right abdomen and then changed to a constant dull discomfort on the whole right side with diarrhea and bloating. My mom thinks it's my gallbladder acting up cause I can feel the pain at the bottom of the ribcage, behind it, but then why did the whole thing start with right side lower abdomen pulling/tightness sensation and only then overtook the whole right side of the abdomen? Also, I dont have nausea and haven't thrown up. Got a CT scan and it ruled out appendicitis, and didn't show anything alarming. I have a GI appointment in March. Please tell me there's someone out there that has had the same symptoms and knows what it is?

And dont even get me STARTEDüî•üî• on the fashion Sukunas drip is sus af like hes rocking that ancient king vibe but its more ancient king who raided a thrift store than ancient king who commands legions of demons Gojo tho is effortlessly stylish that blindfold iconic that hair legendary that smug smirk the cherry on top of the sundae hes a walking runway show Sukunas whole aesthetic screams I havent slept in centuries and my wardrobe is all hand me downs from a cursed spirit üíÄ

Speaking of cursed spirits lets talk about Sukunas hygiene bet he smells like old parchment and despair bruh the BO the sheer stench from that ancient powerful yet unhygienic kingü§Æ Gojo tho probably smells like expensive cologne and victory a custom scent made by a fancy perfumer using rare magical ingredients stolen from aüëÄ cursed spirit Gojo casually clapped while solving a rubiks cube blindfolded  

Honestly Sukuna is overratedü•± overhyped over everything hes the type of guy who brags about his achievements while needing a whole team of cursed spirits to carry his bags Gojo tho casually carries the whole jujutsu world on his shoulders while looking fly and smelling fresh Hes the true king the ultimate Chad the GOAT Sukuna is just a grumpy smelly kinda invincible old man clinging to his past glory and probably a bad tipper üò¨bet he stiffed the waiter in the afterlife noodle shop the AUDACITY

The fact that Sukuna even caused ANY trouble isüòπ cuz everyone else in the jujutsu world is trash they play on easy mode while Gojo plays on a level that doesnt even exist yet  üôèSukuna is a Tuesday Gojo is a cosmic Tuesday and by cosmic Tuesday I mean idk u get it hes just Gojo The end ü•±

Okay, but now let's talk about what's important and 90% of the reason to why he is such a fraudie, let's talk about Sukuna's tragically underwhelming low taper fade üíÄüòÇ Seriously, WHAT were they THINKING?! It's the kind of haircut you'd expect from a guy who spends his days brooding in a dimly lit crypt instead of, you know, ruling the cursed energy world. It's not just a bad haircut; it's an existential crisis disguised as a hairstyle! It's the sartorial equivalent of a lukewarm cup of instant coffee‚Äîdisappointing, predictable, and utterly lacking in pizzazz. This ain't no sharp, sculpted fade that screams power and dominance; this is a fade that whispers timidly into the void, begging for attention it doesn't deserve. The lines are blurry, the blend is sus af, the overall effect is...sad üò≠ It's the kinda fade that makes you question the competency of whoever wielded the clippers. Was it a cursed technique gone wrong?! A vengeful spirit wielding the clippers as a weapon of despair?! Did they even *use* a mirror?! ü§î The unevenness is a crime against symmetry, a visual assault on the very principles of barbering. It suggests a lack of attention to detail that's shockingly inconsistent with someone possessing his supposed power. You'd expect a king, a god, a powerful cursed spirit to have a haircut that reflects that power; instead, we're left with something resembling a sad attempt at blending in‚Äîa haircut so forgettable, it's practically invisible! The low taper itself is aggressively mediocre, devoid of any personality or flair. It's the haircut of someone who gave up on life, a haircut that screams, ""I've given up on my appearance, much like I've given up on maintaining a semblance of decent personal hygiene.‚Äù And the fade itself? It's not a fade, it's a slow, agonizing descent into blandness. It's a testament to the fact that even the most powerful beings can still have utterly dreadful haircuts. It's a tragedy, a visual tragedy, a crime against good taste, and an insult to anyone who's ever experienced the joy of a properly executed low taper fade. In short, Sukuna's haircut is a disaster, a low-effort, high-embarrassment fade that should be studied in barbering schools as a cautionary tale‚Äîa stark reminder of what *not* to do. It's a haircut that embodies defeat before the battle even begins. Seriously, bruh, get a new barber. üíÄüòÇü§£

Okay, buckle up buttercup, because we're about to deep-dive into Sukuna's epic rizz-fail and his tragically nonexistent huzz. Prepare for some serious brainrot, because this is gonna get WILD. üíÄüòÇ

First, let's tackle Sukuna's complete and utter lack of rizz. Forget smooth operator; this dude's more like a rusty, creaking gate that's been left out in the rain for a millennium. He's got the power to obliterate entire cities, but his game is weaker than a wet noodle üçú His attempts at seduction are less ""seduction"" and more ""accidental summoning of a minor cursed spirit."" He's the king of curses, but his flirting skills are about as sharp as a marshmallow. He's got the power to bend reality, but he can't bend a single heart (unless it's through sheer terror, which is hardly romantic). Forget charming; he's more terrifying than a poorly executed escape room üö™üí• His attempts at smooth talk probably involve casually threatening to eat someone's soul. He's the kind of guy whose pickup line is ""I could destroy you with a single finger, wanna see?"" The absolute *lack* of rizz is astounding. It's a void, a black hole where charm should be. It's less a lack of rizz and more of an *anti-rizz*, a rizz-repelling force field that pushes people away rather than drawing them in. He‚Äôs got the power, the status, the ancient king thing going for him...but his game? Zero. Zilch. Nada. The man's a walking, talking, soul-eating testament to the fact that power doesn't equal charm. In fact, in Sukuna's case, they're inversely proportional. He‚Äôs the ultimate example of how to have ALL the power and absolutely ZERO game. He‚Äôs the anti-rizz champion, the ultimate rizzless king üëëüö´üî•

And his ""huzz""? Even worse. He doesn't just lack rizz, he lacks *everything* that makes a person attractive. It's not just a lack of confidence; it's a profound absence of personality. He‚Äôs a walking, talking monument to boredom. He‚Äôs so devoid of charisma that if he tried to impress someone, the surrounding air would spontaneously combust from sheer tedium. He's not even intimidating in a conventionally attractive way; he's just‚Ä¶irritating. A walking, talking, soul-eating migraine ü§Ø His huzz is nonexistent. It's a myth, a legend, a tale whispered in hushed tones‚Äîa tale of how one can be powerful yet utterly devoid of anything resembling charisma, attractiveness, or, frankly, basic social skills. He‚Äôs got the curse, but he doesn't have the charm. He has the power, but he doesn't have the pull. He is, in essence, a legend‚Ä¶a legend of epic, soul-crushing, rizzless proportions. üíÄüëëü§£ He's the king of curses, but his social skills are about as advanced as a rock. Seriously, someone needs to teach this ancient king how to flirt. Like, ASAP. üò¨

And yo, can we just take a moment to appreciate how sukuna got straight up clowned by yuji and wuta? üòÇ like, how you gonna let a dude with a goofy name (yuji, come on bro, it‚Äôs kinda funny) and a dude who‚Äôs basically a snack üç£ (seriously, wuta be looking like a whole meal) run circles around you? that‚Äôs just sad, fam. like, imagine being the king of curses (more like the king of fraud lmfaodoa) üëë but getting dunked on by some high schoolers! lmao, where‚Äôs the respect for the king, man? it‚Äôs giving major L vibes, no cap, he rpobavku was trying to rizz em up or something because he such a drake follower no cap fr

i mean, sukuna is supposed to be this terrifying force, right? but here he is getting played by a couple of kids. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è like, bro, you need to step it up! it‚Äôs 2023 and you can‚Äôt be out here letting these young bucks make you look bad. i‚Äôm just saying, if i was the king of curses, i‚Äôd be out there flexing my power, not getting embarrassed by some teenagers fr fr couldn't be my GOAT Go/Jo 

for real though, sukuna you stupid bum needs to take a long hard look in the mirror and figure out his life choices. like, are you really gonna let this slide?  or are you just gonna hang it up and retire? because at this point, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looking like. smh, sukuna really needs to get his act together or he‚Äôs gonna be the laughing stock of the whole curse world! üòÇ

1iyy8gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1iyy8gf/28m_anywhere_been_focusing_on_selfcare_but_now_im/,"28M | Anywhere | Been focusing on self-care, but now I'm putting myself out there!","I've kept to myself most of my life, however with the onset of the new year I think it's finally time to find someone to be with. Kinda hard for people to know you exist if you don't make yourself seen!

I live in the Midwest USA, and I am willing to start a relationship from anywhere. Japan, Europe, Africa doesn't matter to me! That being said however, if you are not willing to travel or communicate - then a more serious relationship is off the table. Still more than happy to be a friend, though.

I do not care about your religious beliefs or politics. I feel like differing beliefs create nothing but friction and can be damaging to a relationship that has everything else going for it. I'm an Omnist Pagan, this means that I believe the true spiritual way is hidden amongst the world's religions. What do they all have in common? I feel that by studying that, one can find peace and positivity sprinkled amongst them all. Whether you are Christian, Buddhist, Islam, or any other religion - I will always respect your beliefs. We believe what we believe and we are all on our own spiritual path - and I expect the same respect. Similarly, whether you are right wing or left wing doesn't matter to me. Believe what you feel is right, but do NOT try to force them on me.

I have minor standards when it comes to what I want in a potential permanent partner.

This standard is non-negotiable, the rest I can be flexible on: I am not romantically or sexually attracted to transgender women. I want a biological female, because I want children that come from me. I am more than happy to be a friend, but I will never be able to commit to a permanent relationship. The biological compatibility just isn't there.

Do not be clinically obese. Obesity causes severe heart problems, diabetes, and damages the cartilage in your joints which can lead to permanent pain management as you grow older. It also damages your ability to enjoy things like hiking, roller coasters, or certain foods (depending on medical condition), and the worst part of all? These conditions can be passed down to your children. That's not what I want for my children, or my permanent partner down the road.

Be hygienic. Brush your teeth, shower regularly, use deodorant. I really feel like I shouldn't need to mention this but you'd be surprised...

Do not be needy. My job means I have to take occasional business trips. If you are demanding my attention 24/7, then you are asking me to sacrifice everything I have built for myself and everything that I want to enjoy just to focus on you. That's not happening. If we're relaxing at home - of course we're gonna spend time together! But if I need a couple hours of me-time, or want to go to the gym, I expect that time to be respected. I'll do the same for you! Whether it be a girl's night out, or spa date - all I'll want is a text when you leave and when you come back just so I know you are safe.

Finally - if we don't have a lot in common, a serious relationship isn't going to happen! It just isn't. I don't want someone who thinks they have to change themselves and who they are just to be with me. I like video games, and you like movies? Don't force yourself to like video games - and don't force me to watch your movies. I love Legos and you think they're childish? Don't force yourself to love Legos - but don't expect me to be willing to be a partner if you try to force me to stop enjoying Legos.

That being stated, I love trying new things! I will try everything at least twice. I love new experiences, and I love exploring. Maybe you have something you are passionate about and want to share? Chances are, I'll explore it myself and ask you where to go with it. Maybe I'll find a new like! Or potential dislike. Know that I am willing to try just about anything, how can I have the integrity to say I like or dislike something when I haven't even tried it?! That being said, there is a small group of things I inherently dislike and will never do - but all of those are related to more adult matters. If you know, you know.

I always set some time aside to keep my place clean and organized. I just like a clean environment.

I really enjoy creative games like Rimworld, Space Engineers, or Cosmoteer. The only FPS I really play is Rainbow Six Siege. I'm far more likely to play Dragon's Dogma, Project Zomboid, or whatever else scratches my itch.

I love to cook and make desserts! Chicken n Dumplings, a good steak, a comforting soup, a sweet banana pudding - I just enjoy making them!

I also love coffee, sometimes I'll make my own lattes or cappuccinos with what I have on hand - Starbucks can be expensive! I try to go outside or be active at least once a week, there's just a lot to do out there and I want to be able to enjoy it. Home time is fine - but if the weather is nice, why not go out and do something? Touch grass!

One of my indoor activities is weekly DnD. I'm a Pathfinder 2E kinda guy, and I really enjoy all the creative character-crafting and problem-solving that it offers. Also, it's just plain fun.

If you're willing to try new things, care about yourself and your body, are willing to keep in touch and communicate with honesty, and are willing to take an interest or enjoy my hobbies with me - then maybe you're the one! My boundaries are not end all be all. For example, if you are needy - but we have a ton in common and enjoy the same things - then the chances are good! Just keep in mind that the less we have in common, the less likely it will be for something serious. I will still be more than happy to be friends, but it will most likely never progress beyond that.

If you ever want a pic, or have questions, or just wanna chat - just shoot me a DM! I track my notifications and check my inbox often, especially after submitting a post like this. So if I am not busy at work, or focusing on another task - chances are you will get a reply at least within an hour.",0,1740603843.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

So I had a plastic surgery done recently, It was something I‚Äôve been wanting to do and finally had the courage to do it. (Before anyone judges, i had a deformity)
did not tell my husband the details at first but 2 days before, I showed him videos of what to expect and what it will look like. I asked him explicitly to look after me. He took off work Thurs and Fri to be with me. Thursday I was literally bed ridden and he would give me my meds and bribg me food. Our dau is 10 and self sufficient but still needs entertaining so he does that too. Come Fri, he just let me in bed he said i thought i wanted to rest. I had to eat a bread and heat up soup my self. I was still very groggy. Come Sat he went to work Sat morning, my dau was the one looking after me, served me coffee, bread, bribg me water, threw my bloody clothes in the wash. She‚Äôs amazing i just cant üò≠üò≠üò≠.. so my husband came home i asked him to help me shower, he did. Then after that he just stayed in the garage all afternoon and night to drink. He drinks at least 3x a week. This already pissed me off. I didnt say anything. Sunday he woke up at 11. I was already feeling better. My dau and i made breakfast together. Then my dau asked if she can go to a playpark. I didnt say anything i was hoping they both stay with me. 2hrs passed. Then my husband told me they‚Äôre leaving. Without even asking me if im ok, if i need anything, or if it‚Äôs ok for them to go. I was dumbfounded. I cried. Where‚Äôs the compassion?. I would never leave them alone if they‚Äôre sick and in pain. 
So fast forward to that night i told him i want to separate. The only reason we‚Äôre together is bec of our daughter and finances. I couldve left him long ago because we‚Äôre not intimate (for more than a year now) and we have different goals in life. He‚Äôs not a partner. He drinks a lot. We‚Äôre just co parenting. He‚Äôs not a bad person ,  he‚Äôs a great father but not a good husband to me. He does the bare minumum. He‚Äôs not romantic.

First time poster long time lurker. If the format is off I'm using a phone. This is regarding my so called family, I (F37) have already blocked and went NC with my mother (F60). 

To begin with I couldn't even begin to describe my relationship with my mother. There have been many instances in the past where I question our relationship from having to take all working hours she accepted on my behalf at 16,  plus attending school full-time as well as babysitting my sister. She herself was back in education at this time. She always started an argument if I went out with friends/bf, was physical during arguements (face slapping), constantly being told to leave her home and why did she bother bringing us with her (father was abusive), refusing to speak if she didn't get her own way and 'overdosing' when she was called out on her crap. Never being there when I needed her (even in big trauma events I was told to get on with it) but was mostly always there for other siblings.   

 This is just a very quick over view of some of her negative qualities. I do try and balance things as my mother didn't have it easy, she'd a difficult upbringing plus DV. I think it's worth mentioning that I started placing boundaries after attending therapy and realising how much I was conditioned/feared her to disobey and placed boundaries to begin to protect myself, she didn't really take well to this.and began saying she missed her 'best friend', how things are different etc. 

For the past 18 years and prior I've done my utmost to help her out with whatever from being a shoulder to cry on to helping with my younger sister C (mid 20sF) babysitting her when she was younger and being her support when she was in a bad place prior to drugs. I was there even when my health took a bad turn (mobility issues/autoimmune disease) or I'd just given birth and was struggling with PPD (Only visited and checked in when it suited but ran around after T buying and caring for baby). So much so that I was collapsing, she on one occasion stepped over the top of me after I collapsed during an argument. 

I cut contact with my sister C a couple of years ago when she physically assaulted me and lied about things, according to her I had allegedly done to her as a child, this was caused by her having MH problems due to drug use plus a lot of other things (drug addiction/MH problems) she offered a weak apology blaming her illness. My mother eventually got fed up with this dynamic and tried to tell me to get over it.

 I have 3 kids my eldest f15, has mental health issues& autism (which my mother disputed and played down, constantly comparing her to her cousin who was diagnosed young but that's a whole other tale). I still have issues with my own health and currently studying part time. It always felt like there was a different expectation placed on me than the others. 

My mother is constantly there for my sister T (F34) and her 2 kids (early to mid teens ), even though she drank under age, lies repeatedly, slept around got pregnant and stole money from the family. My mother has watched/still watches her kids when she works and when she needs a break (my mother practically raised Ts kids) T is also in a decent paying job, she lives in a relatives house paying rent when she sees fit, my mother has paid towards heat and electric over the years along with feeding and clothing Ts kids. Not to mention cleaning up after my nephew's, T and her fianc√© on a regular basis. She also helps my other two siblings with their kids and pets. Watching them and buying necessities for them.

My kids are an after thought, I can count on my one hand  how many times she's watched my kids and each time there was an incident. The worst being she fell asleep smoking with my two kids beside her (they never stay overnight with her in her home, it was unavoidable circumstances, they haven't stayed overnight since). The last time she watched them was nearly 2 years ago, she emotionally dumped her troubles about C onto my eldest, sat on her phone and told my eldest to make her coffee and look after the youngest (then F3).  My kids seem to be punished as they have actively invested and protective parents, my mother doesn't seem to know how to be a grandparent. 

I've had repeated discussions met phrases similar to,  'you were the strong one' didn't have to worry about you', ' you didn't ask for help'- this one in particular annoys me as with my siblings she offers or just does it for them. 

She constantly compares herself to me and comments repeatedly on my body and intelligence. We both have similar degrees, but due to SA trauma, constantly working and watching my sister I didn't do as well, this is held against me. 

Ive got told in anger after I asked why I was treated different, she doesn't like me, as I'm a better mother, partner, person than she ever was. How her issue is I never invite her places/dinner with my family. I haven't once been invited to dinner in her house since I left at 21, my siblings (and even their new partners), always get invited to Xmas dinner, me, kids and partner have our own (his parents are dead). she constantly cooks for them, things they liked growing up, I've got told I'm picky and a better cook anyhow, why would she bother. The things I did do for her over the years, take her weekly shopping and out for coffee, was there within minutes of needed, drove her places, was a listening ear/emotional support, dragged into mediate when she fell out with siblings etc all while my siblings went on with their lives.

I've lost weight over the past few years  (medically required reasons and just ran with it) im met with constant remarks about losing too much weight, I'm addicted to working out and looking emaciated. I was drained and tired from repeated meetings with drs/schools and balancing 3 kids plus activities that led to that comment, no offer of help. 

This point leads us to the current situation, where I said I would pick up crates for her from T's yard and take them to her house, we live  1-2 mins drive from each other so I'd fit helping her (an unexpected appointment regarding youngest popped up at her school) it was only day I thought I was totally free besides a medical appointment that morning, the rest of my week was hectic, then kids were off on summer break. I'd an hour and a half in between things so I said I'd see if they would fit and go from there , however arriving at T's, I was told they weren't in her house yard but at T's place of employment, which is a 40+ min round trip and only 1 crate would fit at a time, if it fitted at all. At this new piece of information, I suggested my mother ask T's fianc√© to get them, he has a van and could do it in one run, plus I believe she does enough for both of them and they should have no issues doing it for her. This evolved into my mother at the time agreeing that he should collect them, however she didn't bother contacting via msg for a few weeks or her usual weekly visit to 'catch up',  

When I saw her 3 weeks later in person dropping a present off at T's, she was there babysitting as T was away on an overnight with her fianc√©. I was met with being looked up and down, sneered at in disgust,her pointedly telling me she was sick and  closed the living room door.

I received a message a couple of days later requesting would it be ok to call and see me and the kids, she's feeling better. I personally haven't responded as I'm tired and exhausted from my life and everything going on I just don't have the energy to deal with her, so I went NC. 

She also deliberately delayed my eldest bday card by a week around this time hoping I'd contact her and T guilted her into sending it eventually. 

Prior to Xmas I was sent by her 'anonomously'  a $200 gift via a delivery company that I can't return as it's not from my account which I'm left flabbergasted at. Sad thing is it's something T would love (she loves this particular brand of item), I have similar but in a brand I like so I have no use for it. I intend to give it to T as I want no part of it.

My current problem is T has requested I be her MOH next year, she is requesting a couple of days destination bachelorette party organised by me, including my mother and C (know I won't get their portion of the money so I'll be down money), as well as organising a night in our home town. She also doesn't care if we speak but I suspect I will try to be forced to interact etc, I've tried to point out the flaw in her ignorance of the obvious, but at this point I'm over things. Im not in mood to be gaslit that I'm being unreasonable they have done this to me before regarding another family celebration that C was attending I didn't feel comfortable attending.

 I know if I turn the role down no one will see my point of view, as 'im the golden child' because I never got in trouble I was never shouted at as much, (they didn't see the other things she did parentifcation, manipulation, threats etc). I was terrified of the consequences so kept my head down and just got through it. My sister's weren't forced out to work at 16, they didn't have to cook/clean, were allowed to have friends and weren't threw out for answering back etc. When they done something there was shouting, screaming and then I'd be dragged into calm everyone down and get them talking or the blame turned on me and she would start on me.  No one stepped in when I was the one getting threw out/slapped etc. 

There of course will always be more to the story but I've given the relevant parts that have led to my current predicament.

WIBTA if I wrote a transparent letter to all concerned cutting all contact with all of them and reasons for doing so. 

Thank you in advance to those who have taken the time to read my vent. I'm seeking advice/perspective after years of being gaslit and made to compromise and I'm.doubting my own judgement. A 3rd person perspective would be appreciated.  ",2,1740603506.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,4,0.75,False
1iyy3c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanPitBulls/comments/1iyy3c2/neighbors_pits_broke_into_my_yard/,Neighbor's pits broke into my yard.,"I'm so lucky I was outside having coffee while my sweetheart dog wandered around my fenced backyard. She's still a teen and thinks every dog is God's gift to her and if it was up to her she'd approach and ignorantly try to play with every single one (we're working on it). 

I noticed some rustling on the other side of the fence - 3 dogs were patrolling the other side, one was a tiny nervous terrier who ran off, one was an ancient medium bully mix who could hardly hear or see and likely wasn't a threat, but following them was a huge ~70 lb aggressive pit who started snarling at me just being in my own yard. I picked up my dog and threw her inside SO FAST, bless her heart she was trying to bound over to greet and socialize with them. The older dog broke through our fencing, followed by the big pit, and started posturing and growling at my dog through the sliding glass door. Eventually, their owner came to get them.

I'm just extremely unnerved. I worked so hard to find an affordable home with a yard for my dog, I've never seen these dogs roaming before but they only live a few houses away. I've been letting my dog out alone in the morning to potty and sniff for months because I felt safe here, I don't want to think about what could've happened if I hadn't been there to throw her inside. Obviously she's only going out fully supervised now and I'm working to secure the fence even more. It just feels violating, y'know? Disruptive to my mental health and peace knowing this could happen at any time now that those dogs know about my yard. 

My rescue pup has suffered enough in her short life, she was surrendered by a neglectful owner starving and badly injured, got a puncture wound that the shelter didn't notice that needed surgery and months of complications when I got her, and was bit by an aggressive dog about a year ago. If those dogs enter my yard again, I will be using whatever means necessary to protect her.",26,1740603499.0,BanPitBulls,8,1.0,False

I have an appointment with the doctor but it‚Äôs a couple of weeks away, so I want to do what I can to address this in the time being.

(or both)","I don't even know where to begin. After being diagnosed with ADHD last year I finally figured out why I gravitate so strongly to stimulants. Vyvanse has improved my life drastically, but between Zyns and absurd amount of coffee I don't have an appetite. 

He also asked if I have an eating disorder. We are long distance and every time he sees me I've lost weight. I wear baggier outfits to hide it around him and others and nothing fits. Being completely honest, at the start I did not mind at all - I already have a high metabolism and wouldn't mind being skinny. I am 5'5 and weighed 130 last fall but now I way 113. I don't see a problem with that part, but it's just made me realize these habits have made my weight slip away. also have digestion problems that hurt my stomach when I eat certain foods. Not exercising and preparing food or grocery shopping has also been very convenient for me bc im a full time college student that works. 

What I'm starting to realize that's not convenient is the brain fog, dizziness, black outs when standing up, feeling drained at times, my heart beats slow and hard at times. 

I just wonder if anyone relates to this.... it just comes down to not caring enough to do anything about it. The process of cooking AND eating is very unappealing, and extra work that I don't care to do. I don't restrict, count calories, or even work out. My job while in school is being a waitress, and all the walking around the restaurant does not help my case. I started counting my calories this last week for literally the first time ever and its around 500-800 if I eat, and found out my maintenance last night is 1800, which feels like a tall mountain to climb at the moment. 

I know I'm not stupid - eating is one of the most basic human functions. I think I've been doing what I can to make it. But my boyfriend and every source on the internet is telling me that this lifestyle is not sustainable. It makes sense, but why can't I take it serious enough to make a change? 

Something that has somewhat helped is picturing myself as a smiling 5 year old girl that was fed, happy, and healthy. That I would not take care of her in any way close to this (I'd be in jail). I feel like this could be the start of me fighting for myself and my future before anything bad happens. ",1,1740603051.0,mentalhealth,1,0.99,False

Personally, I think coffee is the GOAT. It's a natural nootropic, boosts focus, enhances productivity, and gives that energy kick without major side effects. Plus, it's socially accepted and even considered a necessity for most people.

But if we talk illegal ones, mdma (ecstasy), shrooms and acid are my personal fav. mdma makes u feel insanely happy and social, shrooms/acid boost creativity and give crazy introspective experiences and opens up a whole new perspective. plus psychedelics helped me w anxiety/depression too.

**\~ 0400:** woke up (unplanned) and couldn't fall asleep  
**0600:** alarm rings  
At first I wanted to sleep for another 15 minutes, so I change the alarm and close my eyes. And in the next second my mind says ""are you stupid? Why would you fall asleep now for the next 15 minutes, if you couldn't fall asleep for the last 2 hours?  
True that. So, I stood up, ate 200 g of almonds (\~1238 calories) with Cola and water, while listening to some meditation and while writing this first part of the post. And I already wrote a part of tomorrow's post already. So now it is 0652 and doors open at 0730, so I make myself ready now to go to the event.  
I am just hoping that I don't have to drink too much coffee today to stay awake, because the more coffee I have to drink, the more I have to pee.

**0806:** Arrived at workshop

* I forgot to mention it on yesterday's post:
* 8195 people from 86 countries joined together with one goal in mind: leave their past behind.

**Part 1**   
Explain to partner ""break""s: 9

* It was cold, so I decided to wear a long underpants (jogging leggings thing) tomorrow.
* Quote: A part of you must die.
* Release one negative person, one negative thought at a time from your life. No need for miracles, where everything happens at once. Just like a castle is build brick by brick by brick. You and I can create the life we want by banishing one negative thing at a time and then suddenly, we will become that ""over night success"" and suddenly ""that one meditation"" will do its thing. However that ""over night"" and ""that one meditation"" was a process of daily meditation for months.
* I will list things which ""trigger"" me at work and delete them from my life using the NLP techniques below.
* Quote: The hardest path of war is the last battle.
* Regarding BOTEC: I will try to sense the space around the energy centers, instead of focusing my symbol into the spot where the energy center ""should be"". I don't know if it will help, but sensing space around body parts is one part of the mosaic.

**Part 2**  
Explain to partner ""break""s: 7

* We cannot attract, what we are in lack of.
* Some stuff has to fall away, so something new can occur in your life (partner, job, hobby, etc.)
* 1245 to 1328 Meditation Generous Present Moment

**Part 3**  
Explain to partner ""break""s: 6

* I have been thinking about the music after a break. It might have two reasons.
   1. Hype up the people, who want to be hyped up by music and hype up the people who dance to the music even more.
* 2. Get those people who say ""I dont like the music"" or ""I dont dance"" etc. out of their comfort zone.
* 1630 - 1710 - Meditation Tuning into new potential
   * One potential, not two. ""Learn to do one really good first"".
   * This was the first meditation in which I didn't have even one negative thought. That was incredible.

No notes on part 4, because he was explaining the graphics with the brain scans.  
  
**General tips for a progressive retreat in Basel**

* Sitting in the middle is better for two reasons:
* 1. Less wind is blowing in from the sides when the giant doors are open
* 2. it is less distracting during the lectures & meditations, because less people are walking back and forth and less people from the staff are doing stuff, which is loud like closing gates or other metal things clinging as they touch.
* The cues for toilets are massive.
   * If you didn't succeed to go during the pause, go at the ""explain to partner breaks"". You will miss 2 minutes of the lecture, but its better than waiting in line to pee for 30+ minutes (as woman).
   * At the second day, first break, you can go to the underground toilets in the middle and back at the hall, because nobody thought about them at first.
* Getting outside of the comfort zone
   * When the music starts playing
   * level 1: Stand up and do some side steps as the music plays
   * level 2: clap to the beat while ""dancing""
   * level 3: go to the front of the stage and dance and jump there with all the other people who are doing it. 
   * When you go to pee during the lectures, take the shortest path (to save time) but take another route - preferably one path which makes you go from the front to the back - to come back to your seat and look at the people as you walk to your seat. Walk proudly and slowly and see them peoples looking at you and you being in the spotlight for a some seconds. (Most people walk fast and look at the floor probably thinking ""hopefully nobody sees me"" and ""don't stand out, don't stand out"").

**Foods & drinks**

* Drinks are for free. However, getting a coffee during break is a pain in the ass. Either get it during the time the music plays after a break or walk out fast on break and be one of the first to get a coffee.
* The same applies for lunch. You know its coming. So just stand up and go to the place, where you eat, so you are one of the first ones. Otherwise you will have to wait. Although it doesn't really matter, because you have a 90 minute lunch break.
* On the short breaks you get: a croissant (or some other pastry) and an apple or pear.
* On Day 2 for lunch you get what you see in the picture below. A pumpkin soup, a tiramisu (not in picture) and either Tofu-Chicken or salmon as ""meat"" and the other stuff with the meal. It tastes alright. I was afraid of the beans, but they didn't make a sound after being in my beautiful tummy.
* It should be no problem to get a second plate after having eaten your first, because there are like 4 or 5 stations, where you can get the food, so nobody will see how much you take.
* For the greedy & hungry ones: Getting more on the short breaks, is also possible. So, it is basically all-you-can-eat during breaks and lunch. However, think about how you will feel during the lecture if you eat too much. In Germany we say ""soap coma"" to the state when we overate and feel like transitioning into a deep & long slumber.

*- The meditations that are the hardest, matter the most.*

**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques to get rid of negative thoughts & pictures**

**Italian love**

* See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
* Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
* Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?

**Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**

* When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
* And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
* Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
* Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe.
* Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
* Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?

**Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**

* Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
* see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
* know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you
* having already banished your old self from your current life and
* your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
* PS: I'm not kidding.

**Banana Boss**

* I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
* Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
* As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
* Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
* NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this.
* It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.
* One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
* Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
* Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
* One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
* One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and says ""This asshole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.

I was looking though the want ad section in the newspaper. There was these job postings and some don't say what the job is because this was a normal thing back then.



You look at the paper and it says job needed, call this number blah blah blah

and they don't tell you what the company or job is. Today, that is all kinds of sus,  but it was a

normal thing back then. So I call this number and the person say ""okay you got the

interview this Saturday.""



This was semi pre internet days. I phoned the bus schedule info line to figure out how to get there. I  took a bus, than a train, than another bus. After the bus, i walked 10 minutes to get to my destination. As soon as I walk into the building i enter the lobby and there is porn playing on the TV in the reception area.



I ask the receptionist that I'm here for an interview but am I in the right place? She asks me my name and I give her my name. She says we'll be ready for you in a couple minutes, sit down please.  I go sit down where the porn is playing and I'm just sitting there awkwardly. All i see is this dude going hard into this chick. I'm trying to distract myself so i don't get hard like looking outside the window. But there is no window. Oh lord what now? So i just look around avoiding the fucking that is happening on the TV. 



So then they call my name and I go into the interview room and this lady is showing lots of cleavage and I'm 16 years old and singing the Darth Vader theme in my head so I don't stare at her giant chest. She asks me why do you want to work for our erotic production where we produce pornography at the pornography store? Ok she didn't say that last part. But you know what i mean.



Again, I was 16 and i was caught off guard.  I had to think of something because I was so surprised. I say the reason I want to work here is to be a gopher.  Get people's Bagels, coffee, and whatever you need. Also i said I don't want to be in videos at first and I would like to work my way up to that. Worst bullshit excuse I ever made.



She asks how old I am and I say 16. She didn't bat an eye and said we'll call you back in a couple days and see if we can hire you. At this point I'm shitting my pants wondering what did i get myself into? I didn't realize until later that that she may have been grooming me since I told this story to a friend of mine.



So I get home and didn't tell my mom about the interview. A couple days later I got a call from the company. The lady said congratulations you're hired.  I go yay and I hang up and I never went back to that place. Again I told my friends this back then and they ask why didn't I go work at that place since it's the ultimate dream? I say how do I explain this to my mom? My friend said you could tell her that you're coming to my house. Every fucking day bruh? She will question that.

MAC PETERSON


The governor‚Äôs house was even bigger than I thought it would be.  

I‚Äôd seen it before, of course‚Äîanyone in Ashwood who‚Äôd ever driven out past the old magnolia groves had seen the Clifton estate, sitting up on the hill like something out of a history book. But seeing it from the car window and being here, stepping out onto the long, curved driveway where the lanterns flickered and the grass looked too perfect to be real, were two different things.  

Dad got out first, adjusting his shirt like he was making sure it fit right. He was wearing a nice button-up, not a suit, but nicer than what he usually wore to work. Mom had on a dark green dress, her hair pinned up like she meant business.

Me? I had khakis and a polo that itched.  My mom had spruced me up, scrubbing my face until every trace of the mud fight I had with Alan was wiped clean. She‚Äôd ironed my shirt twice, telling me I had to look good for the Governor.

Dad let out a shaky breath, then turned to me.  

‚ÄúBest behavior, alright?‚Äù  

I nodded, swallowing against the tight collar of my shirt.  

‚ÄúYessir.‚Äù  

The house was huge. Up close, the columns looked even taller, stretching up into the evening sky, and the front door was big enough that it felt like stepping into a courthouse or a museum. The second we got close, it swung open, like someone had been waiting for us.  

Before we even reached the steps, the big front door swung open, and there he was‚ÄîGovernor William Clifton, his gray curls neatly brushed back, clad in a blazer, a tie, and a smile.

""Well now, look at this!"" he said, grinning like we were old friends. ""The Petersons, in the flesh!""  

His voice was big, the kind that made you want to smile even if you weren‚Äôt sure why. He came down the steps fast, like he wasn‚Äôt the governor of the whole state but just some regular guy who had been waiting all day for us to show up.  

Dad shook his hand, gripping it firmly, and Governor Clifton clapped him on the shoulder like they had known each other for years.  

""You must be Mac,"" the governor said, looking right at me, his voice rich and warm, like syrup poured slow over cornbread. 

I straightened up, suddenly feeling like I was supposed to stand at attention or something.  

""Yessir,"" I said.  

He chuckled. ""Good handshake?""  

I hesitated for half a second before sticking out my hand. He took it, his grip firm but not too tight, like a dad at a barbecue.  His fingers wrapped around mine, warm and dry.  

""Ah,"" he said, not letting go right away. ""Strong grip. That‚Äôs good. Important in a boy.""  

He let go, clapping me lightly on the shoulder.  

""Come on inside now, before Elaine gets on me about keeping guests waiting.""  

I stepped past him, and I felt his hand linger at my back, just hovering before it drifted away. The inside of the house smelled expensive. Not just clean, but polished, like the air itself had been scrubbed. The fire crackled in the big stone hearth, making the whole place feel warm and golden.  

And then Mrs. Clifton appeared, moving like a shadow, stepping in from the hallway so smoothly that for a second, I didn‚Äôt hear her at all.  

""William,"" she said softly, ""don‚Äôt keep them standing in the entryway.""  

She stepped forward, her smile smaller than the governor‚Äôs but still warm, like the polite kind you see in old photographs. She was short and thin, with graying blonde hair framing her face so neatly it didn‚Äôt look like it ever moved. Her dress was simple but elegant, dark blue, with tiny pearl earrings that caught the light.  

""Mrs. Peterson,"" she said, shaking Mom‚Äôs hand. ""It‚Äôs so lovely to finally meet you.""  

""Thank you for having us,"" Mom replied, her voice polite but steady, the way she talked when she was trying to make a good impression.  

""Nonsense,"" Mrs. Clifton said with a soft laugh. ""We‚Äôve been meaning to do this for ages.""  

She turned back toward the house, her movements so smooth it was almost like she floated. ""Come inside. Dinner is ready.""  
 

The dining room was huge.  

A long wooden table stretched through the middle, glowing under a chandelier that looked like it belonged in a castle. Silverware gleamed beside plates that had little gold edges, and at the center of the table, steaming dishes sat waiting‚Äîroast chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans that actually looked good, and fresh bread that smelled like something out of a dream.  

""Mac,"" Governor Clifton said as we sat down, ""you look like a boy who appreciates a good meal.""  

""Yessir,"" I said before I could stop myself.  

He let out a deep, belly laugh. ""Now that‚Äôs what I like to hear!""  

Dinner started, and the governor talked the whole time, leaning forward with his elbows on the table, voice dipping low like he was letting us in on some big secret. But not in a bad way. He told me about growing up in Arkansas, about sneaking into his dad‚Äôs office as a kid, about the time he tried to ride a bull and ended up with a bruised tailbone that still ached when the weather got cold.  

""Did you really?"" I asked, wide-eyed.  

""Cross my heart,"" he said, grinning as he lifted his wine glass. ""And that, my friend, is why you should always respect a bull.""  

I laughed and so did Dad. It was easy, talking to him. Easy in a way that didn‚Äôt feel like we were at a fancy dinner with the most powerful man in the state, but like we were just sitting around a family table, eating good food and telling stories.  

At some point, though, the conversation shifted.  

""You know,"" the governor said, spearing a piece of chicken with his fork, ""your dad‚Äôs done some fine work in this town, Mac.""  

I nodded. ""He works real hard.""  

Governor Clifton‚Äôs smile widened, but his eyes‚Äîblue, sharp‚Äîstayed locked on Dad.  

""That‚Äôs why I wanted to talk to him tonight,"" he said, setting his fork down. ""Big changes are coming to Ashwood. Big opportunities.""  

Dad‚Äôs fork paused just for a second. ""I‚Äôve heard.""  

""I‚Äôm sure you have."" The governor leaned back, folding his hands over his stomach. ""And, well‚ÄîI wanted to make sure those opportunities went to the right people.""  

Silence settled over the table. Mrs. Clifton dabbed the corner of her mouth with a napkin, her face as unreadable as the paintings on the wall.  

I didn‚Äôt understand all of what was happening, not fully. But I knew something was being said, something important.  

Dad nodded, slow. ""I appreciate that, Governor.""  

""Call me Will,"" he corrected, smiling again. ""And I appreciate you.""  

His eyes flicked back to me, just for a second, and I suddenly wished I hadn‚Äôt spoken so much. The moment passed, burning low like the candles that lined the walls of the room. The governor clapped his hands together.  

""Now then,"" he said, looking around. ""Who‚Äôs ready for dessert?""  

The tension melted into laughter, and just like that, dinner went on. The food, the stories, the warmth of the fire in the big stone hearth‚Äîit was easy to forget, just for a little while, that this was anything other than a friendly meal.  

But even as the night stretched on, even as the governor‚Äôs laugh filled the room, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had been decided.  

I just didn‚Äôt know what.






ALAN RUSSELL


The Sheriff‚Äôs station was a squat, unassuming building at the edge of town, tucked between the hardware store and a rundown diner that still smelled like burnt coffee and fried eggs, even long after it closed its doors. The place was nothing fancy‚Äîjust a handful of offices, a couple of holding cells, and a breakroom stocked with stale donuts that had been sitting there since before I was born.

But to us?

It was the one part of town where we were safe, the place where nothing bad could happen. Sheriff Wilkes saw to that.

‚ÄúAhh, hell, if it ain‚Äôt my favorite troublemakers,‚Äù Wilkes boomed as we spilled through the door, his deep voice rolling like thunder, warm and gravelly, carrying the weight of someone who had spent his life talking to men who had something to confess.

I grinned. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in trouble.‚Äù

Mac, beside me, elbowed my ribs. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

Wilkes chuckled, shaking his head as he leaned back in his chair, his uniform wrinkled but well-kept, the gold badge on his chest polished to a mirror sheen. He looked every bit the small-town lawman‚Äîbroad shouldered, silver-haired, a thick mustache curling over his upper lip like something out of an old Western.

The kind of man who would sit you down, tell you a story, and make you feel like you were the most important kid in the world.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre not in trouble, what brings you boys to my humble establishment?‚Äù

Heather stepped forward, tossing a manila envelope onto his desk. ‚ÄúWe found something.‚Äù

Wilkes raised an eyebrow, glancing down at the envelope like it might bite him.

‚ÄúShould I be concerned?‚Äù

Mac grinned. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

Wilkes leaned forward, flipping open the envelope, his expression shifting as he thumbed through the newspaper clippings, faded photographs, and printed-out articles.

Old faces, old names, of people who had once belonged to Ashwood.

Mac sat on the edge of the desk, swinging his legs. ‚ÄúWe were just‚Ä¶ curious, you know? How come people go missing here so often?‚Äù

Wilkes let out a long, slow sigh, rubbing a hand over his mustache.

‚ÄúY‚Äôall been playing detective again?‚Äù

Heather crossed her arms firmly. ‚ÄúIs it true?‚Äù

Wilkes hesitated and for the first time, he looked his age, looked tired, the weight of his job showing plainly on his face.

‚ÄúPeople go missing everywhere,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúLife is‚Ä¶ cruel, sometimes. It‚Äôs not always fair, and it‚Äôs not always kind, and no matter how much we want things to make sense, sometimes they just don‚Äôt.‚Äù

He tapped one of the newspaper clippings, a young man‚Äôs face staring up at him, smiling like he had his whole life ahead of him.

‚ÄúThis boy here? Mark Lassiter?‚Äù

We nodded, eyes locked on the photograph.

‚ÄúI knew his folks,‚Äù Wilkes murmured. ‚ÄúGood people, hardworking. They didn‚Äôt deserve what happened to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did happen?‚Äù I asked.

Wilkes sighed, leaning back in his chair, his eyes distant, like he was watching something unfold behind them. He hesitated for a moment, deciding if we were old enough to know.

‚ÄúMark went hiking with his uncle. They left at dawn, said they were going to fish by the river. But only his uncle came back.‚Äù

Heather‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he say happened?‚Äù

Wilkes didn‚Äôt answer right away.

He reached for a thick leather-bound Bible that sat on his desk, its spine worn with years of use, and flipped it open absently, running a thumb over the yellowed pages.

He did that sometimes, whenever he was thinking.

‚ÄúHis uncle swore up and down that Mark was behind him, right up until the moment he wasn‚Äôt. No screams, no struggle. Just‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù

A chill settled in the air. I swallowed, my throat dry as a bone.

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù Mac muttered.

‚ÄúNo, son. It don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Wilkes shut the Bible, tapping his fingers against the cover.

‚ÄúYou kids ever read the Book of Job?‚Äù

We exchanged glances.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Isn‚Äôt that the depressing one?‚Äù Mac asked.

Wilkes let out a booming laugh, shaking his head.

‚ÄúBoy, they‚Äôre all depressing if you read ‚Äòem right.‚Äù

He leaned forward, resting his forearms on the desk, his expression turning serious.

‚ÄúJob was a good man. A righteous man. But Satan came before the Lord and said, ‚ÄòJob is only faithful ‚Äòcause his life is easy. Take that away, and he‚Äôll curse your name.‚Äô So God let Satan test him. He took his land, his family, his health. Left him with nothing.‚Äù

Wilkes paused, his fingers drumming against the desk.

‚ÄúBut Job didn‚Äôt break. He endured.‚Äù

Silence hung in the room.

‚ÄúYou kids ever wonder why bad things happen to good people?‚Äù

Heather shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù

Wilkes nodded.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt claim to know God‚Äôs plans. But I do know this‚Äî‚Äù

He gestured at the newspaper clippings, the old faces.

‚ÄúThe world is full of trials. People go missing. Bad men do bad things. But if your faith is strong, if your heart is true, then no darkness, no evil, no suffering can take away the light inside you.‚Äù

There was something comforting in the way he said it that warmed the soul.

Mac frowned. ‚ÄúBut what about the people who never come back?‚Äù

Wilkes sighed. He stood, moving to the window, staring out at the town, at the forest beyond it.

‚ÄúI reckon there‚Äôs always gonna be a place where the light don‚Äôt reach,‚Äù he murmured.

There was a long silence, then he turned back to us, that familiar kindness returning to his face.

‚ÄúYou ever hear about the lion?‚Äù  

Mac perked up. ‚ÄúWhat lion?‚Äù  

Wilkes grinned, tilting his head back. ‚ÄúSamson‚Äôs.‚Äù  

Heather groaned. ‚ÄúWe already know that one.‚Äù  

He raised a thick, bushy eyebrow. ‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù  

She sighed. ‚ÄúHis parents wouldn‚Äôt let him marry the girl he wanted, so he went stomping off into the woods, saw a lion, and then‚Äî‚Äù  

‚ÄúKilled it with his bare hands,‚Äù Mac finished, eyes wide.  

Wilkes chuckled, nodding. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Tore the thing apart like a bag of wet paper.‚Äù  

I swallowed.  

The Sheriff‚Äôs bible sat on his desk, thick and well-worn, the leather peeling at the edges from years of use. He ran his fingers over the pages, thumbing through it like an old habit.  

""You know why I like that story?""  

Heather tilted her head.  

""Because it's about strength?"" Mac guessed.  

Wilkes smiled.  

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs about a man doing what needs to be done.‚Äù  

He gave us a warm, fatherly smile, stroking his mustache. 

‚ÄúLet me tell you about the time Samson killed a thousand men with a donkey‚Äôs jawbone.‚Äù  

Heather frowned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs in the Bible?‚Äù  

Wilkes grinned, tickled pink by her question.  

‚ÄúOh, they don‚Äôt talk about it much in church, not the fun stuff.‚Äù  

He leaned forward, bracing his arms against the desk.  

""But it's there. Plain as day.""  

The office was quiet as he told the story, the afternoon sun bleeding through the blinds, slanting across his desk in gold ribbons, dust swirling in the light. Faintly, in the background, I heard the hum of the air conditioner, the low creak of his chair as he leaned back, his boots propped up against the woodgrain.  

He told us how Samson was captured, blinded, bound in iron chains, how he had waited‚Äîbiding his time. How God returned his strength in his final moments, and he brought the whole temple down on their heads. Mac was leaning forward now, eyes wide, while Heather‚Äôs lips pressed into a thin line.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Samson was a hero?‚Äù  

Wilkes nodded.  

‚ÄúA warrior. A man who understood.‚Äù  

He tapped his fingers against the desk, thoughtful.  

‚ÄúYou see, they like to talk about the gentle men. The peaceful ones. The ones who turn the other cheek. But sometimes, son‚Äî‚Äù  

His eyes flicked to me.

‚Äú‚Ä¶sometimes a man‚Äôs gotta pick up the jawbone.‚Äù  

Slowly, he reached down to his belt, sliding his fingers and pulling out a peppermint, popping it in his mouth, instantly reminding me of the first time I‚Äôd met him.

He always had peppermints in his pocket. It was the first thing I noticed about him as a kid‚Äîthe sharp smell of mint every time he leaned down to ruffle my hair, the way his coat pockets rattled softly when he walked.

It was late autumn when I had found him, sitting outside the station, rocking slowly in a creaky old wooden chair, his boots propped up on the railing. A Bible sat open in his lap, the pages yellowed at the edges, filled with little scribbles of notes. He glanced up when he saw me.

‚ÄúWell, look what the cat dragged in,‚Äù he said, tipping his hat back. ‚ÄúYou lose a bet or somethin‚Äô, kid?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He smiled. ‚ÄúThen what brings you by?‚Äù

I scuffed my shoe against the wood, debating whether or not to ask.

‚ÄúDo you believe in monsters?‚Äù

Sheriff Wilkes blinked. 

Then he let out a deep, rolling laugh.

‚ÄúMonsters?‚Äù He gestured to the empty chair beside him. ‚ÄúSon, you best take a seat if we‚Äôre talkin‚Äô about monsters.‚Äù

I sat.

He pulled out a peppermint and unwrapped it slowly, rolling it between his fingers.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a mighty big question for a little fella like you. You worried about somethin‚Äô?‚Äù

I hesitated.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot of kids going missing,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI see all their posters every time I go to Carsons and some of the other kids at school talk about it, too.‚Äù

Wilkes nodded thoughtfully.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a terrible thing.‚Äù

He popped the peppermint into his mouth, chewing slowly.

‚ÄúBut monsters? No, son. Ain‚Äôt no monsters out there.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve been Sheriff in this town longer than you‚Äôve been breathin‚Äô. And if there were monsters, I reckon I‚Äôd have seen one by now.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I didn‚Äôt believe him, not really.

Sheriff Wilkes sighed, rubbing a hand over his jaw.

‚ÄúTell you what,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI may not believe in monsters, but I do believe in somethin‚Äô worse.‚Äù

I looked up. His eyes were steady.

‚ÄúMan.‚Äù

A chill ran through me.

‚ÄúNow, don‚Äôt you go worryin‚Äô yourself,‚Äù he added quickly. ‚ÄúMost folks in this world are good. But some men, Alan‚Ä¶ Some men are rotten. They get greed in their bellies, sin in their hearts. And they‚Äôll do whatever it takes to get what they want.‚Äù

He tapped the open Bible in his lap.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we got this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe Good Lord gave us a guide. A way to stay right. You read this book, son, and you‚Äôll never have to fear what‚Äôs lurkin‚Äô out there.‚Äù

I stared down at the pages, the words swimming before my eyes, strange and unreadable, like a language half-remembered.

‚ÄúThat looks confusing.‚Äù I said, squinting to make out the words.

Sheriff Wilkes chuckled, a deep laugh that originated in his lower abdomen and lifted upward, the edges of his mustache twitching with mirth.

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry yourself about it, son. You‚Äôve got plenty of time for all that. Now go, run off and play with your friends and I‚Äôll make sure to keep an eye out for those monsters.‚Äù

I got up from the chair, catching the peppermint candy that he tossed to me, and waved goodbye.






MAC PETERSON


The first time I ever took Morgan on a real date, we ended up at the bowling alley.

Not because I was trying to be original or thoughtful‚Äîno, the plan had been to go to The Dairy Shack and split a strawberry shake like they did in movies, but my brilliant plan fell apart the second I realized I had exactly three dollars and seventeen cents in my pocket. Not even enough for fries.

So, in a moment of pure desperation, I blurted out, ‚ÄúWanna go bowling?‚Äù

And somehow‚Äîsomehow‚Äîshe smiled and said, ‚ÄúYeah, that sounds fun.‚Äù

And that was how I learned that Morgan Wright was the coolest girl on the planet.


The Ashwood Lanes was the kind of place that hadn‚Äôt changed since the 70s‚Äîsticky floors, fluorescent lights that buzzed like dying bees, and a jukebox in the corner that only played old country songs.

But when Morgan stepped inside, she made it look like it was exactly where we were supposed to be.

She had this way of belonging no matter where she went, like she could walk into the most run-down, broken place in the world and somehow make it feel alive again. Her ponytail bounced as she moved, her hands tucked into the sleeves of her hoodie, the tips of her fingers peeking out as she leaned on the counter to talk to the guy handing out rental shoes.

And me?

I was an absolute mess in a pair of bowling shoes two sizes too big, trying not to trip over my own feet as I followed her to our lane.

Morgan stretched her arms over her head, grinning as she glanced at me. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said, rolling her shoulders. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the bet?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúBet?‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just playing, are we?‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck, scrambling for something cool to say. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ you could just admit that I‚Äôm gonna win.‚Äù

Morgan snorted, a sharp, amused sound. ‚ÄúMac, you‚Äôre cute and all, but I‚Äôve seen you throw a basketball.‚Äù

I groaned, pressing a hand to my chest like she had personally wounded me. ‚ÄúThat was one time.‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúIt was last week.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶And we don‚Äôt talk about it,‚Äù I muttered quickly.

Morgan crossed her arms, tapping a finger against her elbow as she considered me. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStakes?‚Äù

I thought for a second, then snapped my fingers. ‚ÄúLoser buys ice cream.‚Äù

Morgan narrowed her eyes. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have money for ice cream.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Loser steals ice cream?‚Äù

She laughed then‚Äîan actual, full-body laugh, her head tilting back, her hands gripping her stomach.

And just like that, the rest of the world faded away.

It didn‚Äôt matter that the lanes smelled like old socks or that the neon lights made my skin look weirdly green. It didn‚Äôt matter that my hands were sweating or that I had no idea what I was doing.

Because she was here.

Because Morgan Wright was laughing like that,

And, God‚Äîif I could‚Äôve bottled that sound, I would‚Äôve carried it with me forever.

Morgan took the first turn.

She lifted the ball with effortless confidence, stepped up to the lane, and sent it sailing down the polished wood with all the precision of a trained assassin. It curved slightly at the last second, avoiding the gutters with ease, and slammed into the pins with a sharp, decisive crack. A strike.

I stared, my mouth firmly agape.

She turned to me, smiling like it was nothing. ‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúI go bowling with my uncle sometimes.‚Äù

Of course she did.

Because of course Morgan Wright was the kind of person who was effortlessly good at everything, while I had the upper body strength of a particularly determined gerbil.

I grabbed a ball‚Äîone that was too heavy, too slippery, too absolutely-wrong-for-me‚Äîstepped up to the lane, and immediately chucked it directly into the gutter.

Morgan gasped dramatically.

I turned slowly. ‚ÄúDo not say a word.‚Äù

Her eyes sparkled. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking it.‚Äù

She nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúOh, yeah.‚Äù

I exhaled, dragging a hand down my face. ‚ÄúThis is embarrassing.‚Äù

Morgan nudged my shoulder. ‚ÄúNo, Mac. Losing to me is embarrassing.‚Äù

I groaned, but I couldn‚Äôt even pretend to be mad. Because Morgan wasn‚Äôt making fun of me‚Äînot really. She was laughing with me instead of at me.

And maybe that was why I loved her.

Not because she was beautiful‚Äîthough she was. Not because she was effortlessly cool‚Äîthough she was that too.

But because when I was with her, I didn‚Äôt feel like some dumb kid with too many jokes and not enough sense to shut up.

I felt like someone who mattered.

We played two more games, and I lost both of them spectacularly.

By the time we finally left, the air outside had turned sharp and crisp, the night stretching quiet and endless above us. The stars had come out in full force, spilling across the sky like scattered salt, and for a second, I thought maybe we were the only two people in the world.

Morgan tugged her hoodie tighter around herself, her breath curling in the cold. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really bad at bowling.‚Äù

I groaned. ‚ÄúAre you ever gonna let that go?‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúNot a chance.‚Äù

I bumped my shoulder against hers. ‚ÄúWell, I was letting you win.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. You know. Being a gentleman.‚Äù

Morgan side-eyed me. ‚ÄúMac, you literally said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to destroy you‚Äô before the first round.‚Äù

I sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúI regret my past self.‚Äù

She laughed, shaking her head. Then she glanced at me, a little softer this time.

‚ÄúThis was fun,‚Äù she murmured.

My heart skipped a beat.

I nodded quickly. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, totally.‚Äù

 Then‚Äîshe reached over and took my hand. Not in a big, dramatic way. Not in a way that sent my brain into panic mode. Just casually, naturally, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

And maybe for her, it was.

For me?

I felt like my heart was going to explode.

Because holding Morgan Wright‚Äôs hand on a Friday night under a sky full of stars?

That was the best thing that had ever happened to me.







HEATHER ROBINSON


Kevin‚Äôs house always smelled like cigarettes and old wood, like the kind of place that had been lived in too long, soaked through with the ghosts of beer and bad decisions. It wasn‚Äôt dirty, not exactly, but it always felt like the walls were too tired to hold themselves up, like the floors had given up on being anything but stained and scuffed.

Alan knocked twice, then tried the handle.

Locked.

So, we waited. Somewhere down the block, a lawnmower coughed to life, sputtering before catching into a steady drone.

‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôd be ready by now,‚Äù Don muttered, shifting his weight. ‚ÄúI swear to God, if he overslept again‚Äî‚Äù

Then we heard a loud thud, followed by a series of crashing sounds, like a series of speakers falling down several flights of stairs. There was a low groan, followed by a long pause.Then we heard the slow, dragging sound of footsteps. The door creaked open just enough to see Kevin squinting out at us, his hair a mess, his shirt wrinkled like he‚Äôd slept in it.

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù Alan finally muttered. ‚ÄúDid you just wake up?‚Äù

Kevin scowled. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Then he pushed the door open the rest of the way and a bottle rolled out, hitting the pavement with a sharp, brittle sound, the glass shattering into a hundred tiny fragments, amber liquid spreading out across the porch in slow, syrupy tendrils. Inside, the house was dim, the afternoon sun pushing through the closed blinds in thin, exhausted lines. And there, sitting in his usual spot, was Kevin‚Äôs dad, exactly where we had left him last time and the time before that‚Ä¶ and probably every time in between.

He was slouched in his recliner, a half-empty glass balanced loose in his fingers, his eyes on the television but not really watching. The news was on, some guy in a suit talking about the stock market, but the sound was turned down low.

Kevin sighed through his nose.

‚ÄúDad.‚Äù

His father didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt blink. He just sat there, taking slow, methodical sips, the bottle in his hand his only savior.

Alan shoved his hands in his pockets.

‚ÄúMac couldn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù he said in an attempt to fill the silence.

‚ÄúHad to work.‚Äù

Kevin bent down, picking up the bigger shards of glass, tossing them into the dead flower bed beside the porch, amongst the others.

‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúLemme grab my shoes.‚Äù

He stepped inside, leaving Alan and Don standing awkwardly on the porch. I hesitated, then followed Kevin inside. The air was stale, thick with the lingering weight of old cigarette smoke, the faint bite of liquor settling into the furniture, the walls, the very bones of the house itself. High up on the far wall, his memories were still there, photographs, medals, old flags folded into neat triangles. A display case held a collection of dog tags, a lighter with an eagle etched into it, a rusted KA-BAR knife with the leather grip worn smooth.

Above the fireplace hung the rifle.

Kevin‚Äôs dad never talked about it, never told stories about the jungle, about the heat, about the things he had seen and done, but the war lived here anyway.

You could feel it in the intoxicating quiet, in the palpable air of tension the house always had, wound tight, as if enemy combatants would come surging from beneath the couch cushions at any moment. Kevin came back, pulling on his sneakers, his movements quick, efficient.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said, grabbing his jacket. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

His dad didn‚Äôt look up, didn‚Äôt say goodbye.

He just took another sip and continued to watch the news on mute.

Kevin had told us that he had a plan‚Ä¶ which meant Kevin was going to embarrass himself.

That was just how it worked. The second the words left his mouth, I knew this day was going to be one for the record books. Alan knew it, too, because he was already grinning. Don just leaned back on the picnic table, hands behind his head, eagerly waiting for the show to start.

Kevin rolled his shoulders, standing up.

‚ÄúAlright, boys,‚Äù he said, voice filled with bravado stolen from action heroes of the silver screen. ‚ÄúTime to make history.‚Äù

Alan snorted. ‚ÄúYeah? And how exactly are you planning to do that?‚Äù

Kevin grinned confidently, the look of a man who‚Äôd unlocked every secret within the library of Alexandria.

And then‚ÄîGod help us‚Äîhe flexed, his face shifting hues with the strain.

I squinted.

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ doing something?‚Äù

Kevin‚Äôs face twitched, his cheeks flushing red. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù

Alan bit his knuckle, trying not to laugh.

‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù

Kevin turned away from us, rolling his shoulders again, like that would somehow make him buffer.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working out,‚Äù he said, nodding toward the pool. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time to show off a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, this is gonna be bad,‚Äù Alan muttered, mentally preparing himself.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Don asked nervously.

‚ÄúSamantha Parsons.‚Äù Kevin murmured reverently, holding onto every syllable of her name like an appeal to heaven.

Alan immediately doubled over laughing.

‚ÄúThe lifeguard?‚Äù I asked, blinking.

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the eighteen-year-old lifeguard?‚Äù

Kevin‚Äôs smile faded and he paused, silent for a moment, trying to think of a suitable response.

‚ÄúAge is just a number.‚Äù

Alan wheezed, a sound in between a chuckle and a wracking cough, spluttering on his drink.

‚ÄúOh my God, Kevin, no.‚Äù

It was a hundred degrees out, and the town pool was packed, kids splashing in the shallow end, teenagers lounging on towels, parents standing by the fence, chatting while their toddlers wobbled around in floaties.

Then there was Kevin, standing at the edge of the pool, hands on his hips, pretending to survey the area like a king overseeing his kingdom. Instead, he wound up looking like a toddler peeing hands-free at a urinal with his pants around his ankles, not yet understanding the concept.

Alan leaned toward me, a question on his lips.

‚ÄúWhy is he standing like that?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúTrying to look cool, probably.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe looks like he‚Äôs about to give a speech.‚Äù

Kevin took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and then ripped off his white t-shirt.

Alan immediately lost it, shaking with silent laughter.

‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe looks the same,‚Äù Don whispered. ‚ÄúHe literally looks the exact same.‚Äù

Kevin, completely unaware of how stupid he looked, tossed his shirt to the side like he was an action movie star, then ran a hand through his hair, messing it up in a way he clearly thought was attractive.

Alan was crying, tears of laughter streaking down his face.

‚ÄúOh-oh my god.‚Äù

Kevin ignored us, taking a step toward the lifeguard chair.

Samantha Parsons was the head lifeguard, eighteen years old, with tall, long legs, her dark hair flowing down to her shoulders like a waterfall of Stygian liquid. She sat perched on the lifeguard chair, lazily twirling her whistle around her fingers, sunglasses pushed up on top of her head. She was absolutely gorgeous and Kevin, like an absolute dumbass, thought that meant he had a chance.

Alan leaned over to Don.

‚ÄúWhat do you think the odds are that he drowns?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike, immediately?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Don nodded, mulling it over in his head for a second.

‚ÄúFifty-fifty.‚Äù

Kevin rolled his shoulders and took a deep breath.

He strolled up to the lifeguard chair, leaned against the metal bars, and flashed his baby teeth in what he probably thought was a charming roguish grin, instead settling for a strained smile reminiscent of the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô people in ads for constipation medication. Samantha didn‚Äôt even look at him, her eyes locked on the water, gazing out at the cacophony of noise that erupted from both ends of the pool, from old and young throats alike.

Kevin cleared his throat, attempting to deepen his voice slightly and failing miserably.

‚ÄúHot out today.‚Äù

Samantha nodded.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

Kevin flexed his arm slightly, nodding his head confidently. 

I winced.

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶ you watch a lot of people drown, or‚Äî?‚Äù

Alan slapped a hand over his mouth. Samantha finally turned to look at him, frowning. Kevin panicked, slicking his hair back nervously.

‚ÄúI mean‚Äîyou, uh‚Äîyou ever saved anybody before?‚Äù

Samantha stared at him, raising one perfect eyebrow.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Yes.‚Äù

Kevin nodded several times, desperately racking his brain for any idea of what to say next. Alan was dying, holding back peals of laughter, Don had to turn away, and I was considering pretending I didn‚Äôt know him.

Kevin swallowed.

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù

Alan practically shook with anticipation.

‚Äú‚Ä¶You seeing anybody?‚Äù

Samantha blinked, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth, trying desperately not to laugh. Alan squeezed his eyes shut, already doubled over with laughter. Kevin‚Äôs face was bright red, the color of freshly sliced tomatoes. Samantha won her battle against laughter, returning her gaze to the swimmers lazily basking in the cool water.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said, adjusting her sunglasses. ‚ÄúI actually am.‚Äù

Kevin went completely still, as rigid as the ancient diving board that towered over them both.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúCool. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ cool.‚Äù

Samantha turned back toward the pool, already done with this conversation. Kevin nodded to himself, trying to play it off.

‚ÄúWelp. I should, uh‚ÄîI should probably‚Äî‚Äù

And then‚Äîfate, in its infinite cruelty, decided to make this moment even worse.

Because Kevin went to take a step back and he slipped, his foot wobbling, searching for a flat surface but finding nothing but empty air. There was a horrible, gut-wrenching second where he realized what was happening, suspended in the air. Then he fell directly into the pool, a loud smack echoing across the water like a gunshot as his back hit the surface of the water, completely soaking the lifeguard stand. He surfaced with a gasp, coughing, sputtering, flailing to grab onto the edge, his wet fingers scrabbling for a handhold on the rough surface of the pool edge.

Alan lost it, Don collapsing against the fence. I covered my face in pure secondhand embarrassment, averting my eyes. Samantha just sighed, brushing her wet hair out of her eyes, and blew her whistle.

‚ÄúNo running by the pool, kid.‚Äù

Kevin groaned, floating in his own humiliation.







MAC PETERSON


The first time I came to the Clifton estate, I was a guest. The second time, I was an employee. At least, that‚Äôs how Dad framed it when he told me I‚Äôd be spending part of my summer working there.

‚ÄúGood experience,‚Äù he said, buttoning his cuffs in the hallway mirror. ‚ÄúGets you used to the value of hard work.‚Äù

‚ÄúRich folks pay well,‚Äù Mom added, barely looking up from her coffee. ‚ÄúAnd we owe them.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what we owed them for, but I knew better than to ask. The Clifton estate looked different in the summer. The windows glistened in the heavy sunlight, the massive white columns gleamed like bones, and the long stretch of green leading up to the house looked so perfectly manicured, I half-expected it to be fake.

I arrived on a Monday morning, backpack slung over my shoulder, the heat already pressing down on me like a thick wool blanket. Mrs. Clifton answered the door this time. She was wearing a linen sundress, her ears glimmering with pearls, her expression calm, measured, pleasant.

‚ÄúMac,‚Äù she greeted, giving me a small, polite smile. ‚ÄúHow lovely. You‚Äôre right on time.‚Äù

I stepped inside, wiping the sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand. The air conditioning hit me like a wall. It was cold in here‚Äîunnaturally cold, like the house was fighting off the outside world, refusing to let the season touch it. Governor Clifton was already waiting in the sitting room, sipping his coffee, still in his robe despite the late hour.

‚ÄúNow here‚Äôs a sight,‚Äù he said, setting his mug down on the table beside him. ‚ÄúYou look like a boy ready to work.‚Äù

I straightened.

‚ÄúYessir.‚Äù

He chuckled, rising to his feet.

‚ÄúGood attitude. We‚Äôll make a man out of you yet.‚Äù

Mrs. Clifton placed a gentle hand on his arm, her grip lingering for just a second longer than necessary.

‚ÄúThe list is on the counter,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check in later.‚Äù

The Governor winked at her, then turned back to me, clapping his hands together.

‚ÄúAlright, Mac. Let‚Äôs get started.‚Äù

My first job was trimming the hedges. They stretched along the driveway like sentries, cut into perfectly squared rows, without a single leaf out of place. I spent an hour crouched in the heat, hands aching, sweat sliding down my back like molasses, while the Governor sat in the shade of the porch, a glass of something dark and amber in one hand, watching.

‚ÄúYou got a good work ethic,‚Äù he called over to me after a while, voice thick with approval. ‚ÄúI like that.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt stop working. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt really know what to say that.

He took a slow sip of his drink.

‚ÄúYour father ever take you hunting?‚Äù

I nodded, shifting my grip on the shears. ‚ÄúYessir. Every winter.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Every boy ought to know how to handle a gun.‚Äù

Something in his tone made me pause. I glanced up, expecting him to be smiling, to be giving me one of those big, easy grins he always did.

But he wasn‚Äôt, his expression neutral, almost unreadable, his gaze level, assessing.

I shrugged, looked back down, and kept cutting.


By midday, I was dying. The heat had worked its way into my bones, filling my lungs like I was breathing steam instead of air. My shirt clung to my back, damp with sweat, and the world felt like it was swimming in golden light, shifting at the edges, rippling like the surface of the pool.

‚ÄúBoy,‚Äù Governor Clifton called from the deck chair, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna catch a fever wearin‚Äô all that.‚Äù

I stopped mid-sweep, blinking up at him. He was lounging beneath a striped umbrella, his white linen shirt unbuttoned at the collar, a pair of dark sunglasses hiding his eyes. Mrs. Clifton was beside him, sipping lemonade, her legs crossed at the ankles, the pool water shimmering behind them like glass.

She tilted her head slightly, looking me over.

‚ÄúThe heat is relentless this time of year,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll work better if you‚Äôre comfortable.‚Äù

I hesitated. There was something about the way she said it‚Äîsoft, encouraging, almost motherly‚Äîmade it feel like a suggestion, like I could say no if I wanted to.

But I didn‚Äôt. Because what kind of twelve-year-old says no to two of the most powerful people in the state?

So, I pulled my shirt off.

Mrs. Clifton‚Äôs eyes didn‚Äôt leave me and neither did his.

I went back to work, sweeping like my life depended on it. I finished cleaning the pool with the Governor‚Äôs voice in my ear. He didn‚Äôt leave the deck chair, just lounged there, drink in hand, talking while I scrubbed at the tiles.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an important thing,‚Äù he mused, ‚Äúknowing your place in the world.‚Äù

I nodded, kneeling by the water, running the brush along the pool floor, watching the dirt dissolve into nothing.

‚ÄúA man‚Äôs gotta understand what‚Äôs expected of him.‚Äù

Brush. Scrub.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs owed to him.‚Äù

Brush. Scrub.

‚ÄúAnd what he owes in return.‚Äù

The sun pressed down hot and heavy, but the back of my neck felt cold.

‚ÄúYou understand what I‚Äôm saying, don‚Äôt you, Mac?‚Äù

I stopped scrubbing, turned my head just slightly, just enough to see him peering down at me over his sunglasses, waiting, watching. I got the feeling that this question wasn‚Äôt rhetorical and I hurriedly nodded my head.

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I said.

A slow smile crept across his face, different from his usual grin.

‚ÄúI knew you would.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really want to do dating apps, not long ago I was on hinge and matched with people I thought were out of my league, but it all felt a bit constructed. I really wanna meet people in person. I am usually in places where I can meet people. I gym a lot and also do quite a lot of solo dates to coffee shops and restaurants (found out I love to spend time alone lol)

How do you guys engage with people you find attractive? I don‚Äôt want to come across as creepy and I love the idea of just striking up a conversation and seeing where it‚Äôs going. 

Any comments are super appreciated.

Thanks! ",1,1740602693.0,dating,3,1.0,False
1iyxrru,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1iyxrru/living_with_adhd_sister_makes_me_feel_deranged/,Living with ADHD sister makes me feel deranged and crazy,"Autistic ranting because my sister is a living embodiment of sensory overload and chaos 

For the record I also have ADHD but we basically have opposite symptoms and I struggle to relate to her alot.
ALSO!! not every ADHD person acts like this, she just happens to be a very bubbly hyper person who has ADHD.

We're both adults but she's older then me in her late 20's. We grew up with different families and we're not accustom to eatch others traits and behaviors. (especially me I am so angry with her all the time)



Sorry if this rant seems childish, it honestly is. I need to get it out of my system. 

Nobody IRL knows I'm autistic so alot of this is pent up anger and drama. 

I basically lived by myself for most of my life parents were always working and would leave me at home for months as a child so I am not used to having people in my house in general.

My sister is the opposite, her adopted family is very large and she has many siblings and theyre all very sociable and love talking.

Im worried that venting about this might make me seem like I'm shaming her for her symptoms and I'm not, she just triggers me greatly and I find myself very angry with her most of the time but I've never really taken the time to consider ""why?"" I feel so upset when I'm around her.

That being said alot of what I'm complaining about could be less her ADHD and more so just the overwhelming change of having a sibling even as an adult. But ya.

I have autism, OCD, and ADHD. While my sister only has ADHD, people often make jokes that were 'definitely related' which I find hilarious because her behavior and traits feel like the exact opposite of mine.

She is very loud and social while I'm quiet and antisocial.

I do genuinely think being around eatchother makes our symptoms worse. I get hyper sensitive when I'm in a room with her and I have had people tell me they're 'not sure why she acts so ""cracked out"" around me' 

ANYWAYS, her actions trigger me to no end, it sucks because I can't control it, like I see her and I have to mentally brace myself.

Shes so messy, she makes messes wherever she goes, she's a grown woman and the house will look like a tornado by the time she's done with it and then instead of cleaning she will start a new task or get distracted on her phone.

Here's the thing: SHE WILL CLEAN IT WEEKS LATER, the house will be in shambles like she waits until the last possible second until doing a half assed job.

Not only does she hate cleaning but she seems to love rearrangeding furniture and things which honestly drives me fucking nuts.

So makes everything dirty for weeks, barely cleans it, and then she will move the couch and table and TV to somewhere completely different in the house changing it for months, she won't warn anybody when she does this to she just does it and then will get offended if you don't like it.

The medicine cabinet to. She will move all the bottles and pills in different places with no rhyme or reason, no order based on expiration date or color, it's not based on the type of medication it is. Not in alphabetical order either it's just randomness.

I could wake up, drink coffee like I do everyday, go downstairs to take my medicine that I take everyday and every single pill bottle is in a different place. I hate it.

She won't knock on my door and she will go into my room when I'm not home and move things around like if she's searching for piece of laundry in the house or she wants to use my skinccare products. 

She will go into my room, take something she needs like my moisturizer or my comb. AND THEN NOT PUT IT BACK AND EVERYTHING AROUND THE SURROUDNING AREA OF THAT ITEM HAS BEEN MOVED OR KNOCKED OVER

My entire room is basically display cases,and shelves all filled with figures, dolls, and merchandise of my special interests. I have a deep special interest in home decor and house flipping so the way my room looks matters to me alot, I've spent a lot of time decorating it because I love decorating rooms and I know she's not trying to be malicious but its certainly very stressful for me when I have compulsions to redo ALL of my shelves because a few of my things got touched and knocked over.

Not only that but she will leave the door open not just to my room but to EVERY ROOM!!! We have a cat that loves pissing on things and scratching things and she seems to forget about it's existence and the possible consequences of leaving the doors open EVERDAY.

At the moment I'm surrounded by my mess of a room, she went into my room without telling me and poured out my laundry into my bed while I was at work so she could use the hamper. Of course she also left my door open.

I know this is harmless in retrospect but I had been cleaning my room all day and to see that drove me insane. 

Not only because it was dirty laundry now all over my room, but it was laundry that had been pissed on by a cat. Because she left my door open, The cat proceeded to knock down two rows of my shelves and now I just have piss covered clothes all over my room and display items scattered around.

Im still so upset, I don't want to clean because I feel like it could just happen again, it almost feels safer knowing my room is filthy because I don't have to deal with the stress of wondering if anything is making my room dirty.

Even if she's not speaking to me the constant stimulation doesent end.

I'll watch this woman dance around the house for hours to Bollywood musicals, knocking into things, singing SO LOUDLY at the top of her lungs FOR FREAKING HOURS. She will start a new hobby and leave the house destroyed with Amazon packages, she will say very inappropriate things to strangers and ask incredibly invasive questions.

She just has no shame or respect for other people around here. She LOVES the noise, and I think she's convinced everyone else constantly wants to be talking or stimulated like herself.

I'm very mute, sometimes I go multiple days without speaking if I'm not at work. It can take a lot for me to speak if I'm overstimulated or upset.

If I don't think I have anything interesting to talk about I won't speak, which is the exact opposite of her. She will start a conversation with you even if you don't reply for hours and she will keep talking.

This has led to so many meltdowns from me, I get the courage to speak after being silent all day but she completely disregards my words if it's something she doesn't want to hear. 
For example: 
""I want to be alone right now,""
""Sorry I don't feel like talking""
 ""please stop talking to me"" all go right over her head, she will just ignore me and continue talking as if I'm replying to her. It makes me so upset.

Her ignoring my words genuinely makes me meltdown. It happens instantly, just instant anger when I realize she isn't communicating back to me.

I get into this rage of ""WHY DONT YOU UNDERSTAND ME?????!!!"" When I try to communicate that I need to be left alone she will ignore my words making me feel crazy. Like I start getting confused if I'm making sense because I don't understand why she won't listen when I tell her to stop speaking to me.

She will also hug me and touch me even if I tell her ""No."" I've tried to explain to her that I don't consent to her touching and she fires back with me being to ""Sensitive"" and ""acting like a victim""

Like no!!!!???????? I just don't want your tiny bony girl arms around me!! Her fingers are so small and it feels creepy. She constantly tries to pat my head or shoulder affectionately but it's CREEPY AND IT HATE IT. Why can't no just mean no???? Like godamn!!!

There's no nice way to make her stop either, everything is criticism to her. She will get offended and storm off or yell at me about how rude I am when she's the one who is following me around and hugging me after I tell her not to.

Im so overwhelmed.

Obviously, once I move out and I guess when she does to I won't have to deal with this issue. But it's really hard to be around her at the moment 

I'm gonna suck it up and bare it because I love her and it's unfair for me to expect complete acceptance of my autism if I can't accept her ADHD. But I do wish she would try to be more conscious of others. 

If you actually read all that and you have any experience dealing with people who trigger you I'd love to hear it.

If I can find a way to be more accommodating for my sister id be interested in that to, I love her alot and I want to understand her but trying to navigate both of our neurodivergent ways is difficult when we're so different.

STILL WATER

The sun was burning half my skin, the other was shaded. I sat on the right corner of a metal bench, half hidden in the shadow of her house. The metal was hot enough to burn when I first sat down but was bearable now. I was reading my book, or at least trying to.

My stomach rumbled, but she was in the kitchen. She‚Äôd been there a while now. Smoke rose from the tip of my cigarette, drawing shapeless faces before it curled lazily in the air. A breeze erased them and crashed against the leaves of the apple tree, prompting their green shadows to dance on the floor beneath. A hummingbird sipped anxiously at sweetened water from its feeder. Mocking me.

I returned to my book. She should be leaving soon. I just needed to wait a little longer. The path from the kitchen to her room didn‚Äôt go through this courtyard, so she wouldn‚Äôt pass this way. I just needed to focus on my book, and time would fly by.

I lit another cigarette; that helped a little. My stomach grumbled. Not enough. Did she decide to eat in the kitchen as well? That would explain why she‚Äôs taking so long. The lady of the fountain was staring at me again. Her accusation was clear as day.

*-What?-*

No answer.

*-I'm not even that hungry.-*

Water tickled lazily from her mouth. I wondered what she was making. Probably making something sweet, something delicious. I could almost smell it. This was ridiculous. I stood up, leaving the half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray. The fountain lady‚Äôs gaze followed me as I marched toward the kitchen ,footsteps echoing on the stone path. The breeze stopped, as if the house was holding its breath.I paused at the door,¬† hand hovering over the handle. I could hear her inside. Hard metal clinking against fragile plates. Running water. She was eating something. But she left the tap open. How careless.

I grabbed the handle, and it made a noise as I moved it slowly. The clinking stopped. Why did she stop? I froze, my fingers tightening around the cool metal. The sound of the tap water continued defiantly. Was she waiting for me to come in? The thought made my stomach twist. Loud enough I was sure she could hear it through the door

For a moment, I considered pushing the door open. But then I heard it‚Äîa faint creak, like she was shifting her weight. She was probably sitting on the left chair of the counter; it always creaked like that.

I let go of the handle as if the metal had turned red hot and stepped back, air rushing out of my lungs in a shaky breath. The fountain lady‚Äôs gaze burned into my back as I turned and headed to my room, my footsteps quick and uneven. Her water trickled louder now, a steady, mocking rhythm that followed me all the way upstairs.

Drop, drop, drop.

\*\*\*

I leaned against the balcony of my room, staring out as the sun hid behind the sea, and still, she was in the kitchen. This was rude. Didn‚Äôt she care that I was starving? How long did she plan to stay there?

I came back down to the courtyard as evening swapped the chirping of birds for the hum of crickets, marking the day‚Äôs end. Grabbing the clean ashtray from the table, I made my way to the metal bench and settled into the right corner once again. The metal felt cool now.

The fountain lady seemed less angry now, judging by her expression. Maybe I just couldn‚Äôt see her properly in the darkness. At least the sun had retreated. Maybe she would soon follow.

It was too dark to read, so I just settled for lighting a cigarette, sneaking another glance in the split second my dim light illuminated her. Nope, still judging me.

I focused on the glow of my cigarette, trying to avoid eye contact. I liked the sound it made when I took a drag. It became boring by the third, so by the fifth, I decided to just close my eyes and enjoy the lukewarm night.

When I came to, shadows had completely enveloped the courtyard. I stood up and left the filled ashtray on the table. I‚Äôd pick it up later.

I turned the corner right before the stairs that led to my room and stepped quietly into the kitchen. The door was left slightly ajar, so I peeked in. Bingo, nobody was in there. I stepped triumphantly into the kitchen, only to find a mountain of plates in the sink.

The fridge was empty, so were the cabinets. I checked the fridge again to see if food had magically spawned in the last thirty seconds. It hadn‚Äôt. I started cleaning the plates from the sink. One by one. I took my time with each. I considered licking her leftovers. My stomach growled in agreement. I'm proud to say my better self prevailed, and there was no plate-licking that night. After I finished cleaning and drying the plates, I checked the fridge again just in case. No luck.

After that, I looked for the sugar; I needed to refill the hummingbird's feeder. It might have been in the pantry, but the door hinge squealed, too loud. I didn‚Äôt dare try.

\*\*\*

I opened my eyes to the sight of my ceiling fan spinning. It was so slow, I didn't even know why I bothered to turn it on. I wondered if her fan was the same. I slept on the right side of my queen-sized bed.

I headed downstairs into the kitchen. She was on the terrace by this time of day, so there was no need to worry about making too much noise. I opened the pantry but couldn‚Äôt find the damn sugar. Too bad‚Äîit seemed the hummingbird was going hungry too.

At least there was coffee. Black, of course. I had no sugar or milk. I drank slowly, tasting the bitterness. My stomach complained‚Äîsomething about coffee not being a full meal.

I started washing my mug but froze when I heard a door open in her room. Wasn't she supposed to be on the terrace? I didn‚Äôt dare make a sound, but the running water from the tap betrayed me. Why was she in her room? Had she woken up late? Had she forgotten something?

Shortly after, I heard the creak of the wooden stairs leading to the terrace. I stopped holding my breath, turned off the tap, finished drying the mug, and headed to the courtyard. Book in hand and coffee drained, I grabbed the clean ashtray from the table to begin my day.

The hummingbird drank from a full feeder, and my stomach rumbled. I lit another cigarette and opened my book where I left off. I tried to focus, but I couldn‚Äôt hear my own thoughts over the sound of the fucking hummingbird wings flapping. It was giving me a headache.

I looked at the lady of the fountain. I'd never realized how beautiful her features were‚Äîthat small nose, the soft ridges of her jaw, and slightly puffed cheeks. Her lips were slightly parted, like she wanted to whisper a secret, but only water came out.

I flustered slightly and returned to my book. My stomach grumbled. It was getting harder to focus. I stole another look, and she returned it right back. Water trickled from her mouth, falling to her chest, sliding down her stomach, and continuing through her leg. Sunlight reflected softly where water wet her skin. Stone, not skin. Stone.

The light reflecting off the wall somehow became brighter. My eyes bounced from the hummingbird, drinking happily from that sweetwater nectar, back to her mouth. Her lips.

Drop. Drop. Drop.

It was ridiculous‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt hungry. Wings raged against my ear, and my stomach ROARED in response. I could try‚Äîthe hummingbird seemed happy enough.

DROP. DROP. DROP.

I swallowed, as if that was going to help calm my hunger. It only seemed to make it angrier.

Just a sip.

I glanced toward the stairs leading to the terrace.

Nothing.

I stood up and crept until I was at the edge of her domain. I slowly moved my foot over the edge of the pool and stepped into the cold water gathered at her feet. Just inches from her face.

She was slightly shorter than me. I placed a hand on her cold cheek, then tilted my head somewhat opposite hers and closed my eyes, inching forward. Cold water hit my lips., I pressed my lips to hers and opened my mouth. Cold water seeped down my throat. I moved my tongue into her lips‚Äîher water was somewhat sweet. Just enough to be noticeable.

I drank. The more the cold entered my throat, the hotter I felt. I felt it travel down to my stomach. My heart raced. The more I pressed‚Äîthe more my tongue begged and my lips moved‚Äîthe more nectar came out. Water, not nectar. I was breathing harder now, and blood rushed through my body. I traced my other hand to her hip, as if trying to pull her closer to me.

*Creak*

I spun around and saw her foot retreating into her room just as the door closed.

*FUCK*

Did she see me? A drop slid from my lips to my chin and then the floor.

\*\*\*

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring into nothing. My palms were sweaty. In fact, my whole body was sweating. I still felt her cold water in my stomach. I licked my lips. There was a lingering sweetness coating them. The image of her foot retreating into her room played on a loop in my mind. Had she seen me? What would she think?

The sweetness on my lips was faint now, almost gone. I licked them again, trying to hold onto it, but it was no use. Like catching smoke in my hands‚Äîthe harder I reached, the faster it slipped away. I closed my eyes.

I‚Äôd felt proud for not licking those dishes. Funny how quickly dignity fades in the face of‚Ä¶ what, exactly? I wasn‚Äôt hungry anymore. Not really. It was something else. Something harder to name. I needed to move, so I got up and sat by the window, resting my head against the wall, and let the sound of waves crashing against stone fill the silence. In my haste to reach the safety of my room, I‚Äôd forgotten my book. I didn‚Äôt dare go back for it. Great. What was I supposed to do now?

A faint noise came from the wall‚Äîrunning water. But not from the tap. A shower.

She was there, in her room. On the other side of the wall.

The sound was soft, almost imperceptible. I held my breath to listen better. I lost myself in the steady hiss. Distant waves seemed to join the shower's rhythm. I regained my composure, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of my breath. In through my nose, out through my mouth. I closed my eyes and breathed.

In and out.

The sweetwater sat like a pond in my stomach, my inhale rippling its surface.

In and out.

My exhale came out cold.¬† tried to focus‚ÄîI really did. But she was there, naked. Just a wall between us. I told myself not to think about her. So I breathed. And thought of the shower‚Äîthousands of drops falling happily on the blue tiles of the floor. Steam curling up, filling the room. Clinging to the walls, wetting where the stream couldn‚Äôt reach. Turning the cool night air outside into a humid, thick version of itself. It filled the room, fogging up the mirror, making it harder to see. My breathing grew shallow‚Äîgasping, desperate‚Äîas if I tried hard enough, I could breathe the steam instead. Beads of condensation pooled on the ceiling, then fell, joining the steady stream of the shower. I breathed in through my nose, and out came a single drop from my eye. It wanted to join too.¬† I listened more closely to the stream‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt falling directly on the floor. It was touching her first, visiting her skin on its way to the ground. Only to come back as steam, curling around her, embracing her. I breathed in, then out. Tendrils formed around her and dissolved when she moved.

In and out.

She ran her fingers through her hair.¬† Beads of water ran down her skin. Another ran down my cheek. It threatened to overflow the once still pond inside me. So I took one last, deep breath and tried to hold on. The shower stopped. A window opened, letting the steam go. I breathed out and hear a door opening and then closing. All that was left were the remaining drops still clinging to the wall‚Äîrefusing to give up‚Äîbut eventually losing to gravity and rolling down my cheeks. My vision unblurred as the mirror started to clear. A now empty bathroom‚ÄîStill warm. The pond didn‚Äôt overflow from the top; it drained from the bottom, turning into a muddy puddle. I opened my eyes and was met by my empty room an unmoving ceiling fan and the left side of my bed was untouched.

A food stall needs extra hands right now‚Äîthey find someone nearby in seconds.

1iyxp3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1iyxp3z/anxiety_loop/,Anxiety loop,"Hello everyone, I want to share my story. This is my first post on Reddit, and guess what? I'm in the anxiety section. I'm 26 years old, and I've kind of always felt, maybe since childhood, that I was living with anxiety, but I mostly ignored it and didn't pay much attention to it till things happened.

When I was around 21 years old, one day out of the blue, I woke up with a panic attack and severe DP/DR. I was insanely confused. I hadn‚Äôt really paid much attention to mental health before and didn't take that part of my well-being seriously. But the day I woke up with all these symptoms, it was the most confusing moment of my life. I was so ignorant about it that what I did was sit down (I‚Äôm an active smoker and a coffee lover) and tried to tell myself that it would go away while I was sipping on coffee. Obviously, I spent the whole day in panic, experiencing DP/DR for the very first time, which was insanely confusing and scary as well.

Well, that day ended, but DP/DR didn‚Äôt go away. It stayed with me, and it‚Äôs still with me now. I think it‚Äôs something we should take seriously and be aware of, because it adapted to me, like a parasite. Humans can get used to a lot of things, and after years of living with it, I reached a point where living with DP/DR constantly wasn‚Äôt as scary. It felt like I had it since I was born (which is obviously wrong), and to ignore it is even more wrong.

I went on with my life, thinking, ""Okay, it is what it is."" Years ago, my psychiatrist told me to stay away from any kind of party drugs because even just one night of partying could seriously affect my condition. Well, I stayed away, and I wasn‚Äôt into partying with drugs anyway. But after years of paying less and less attention to my anxiety and mental health, I did some trips to Amsterdam and Berlin. On the latest trip, I partied for four days, mostly with coke.

On the day I was supposed to fly back to my country, I had the scariest day of my life in the club, right after I was done partying. We (my friends and I) were about to leave, and then, suddenly, I felt an intense onset of fear‚Äîfainting, my body going cold, pressure in my chest, pain, jaw tension, difficulty swallowing. I was 100% sure that it was over for me, that I was going to die, and the level of fear was indescribable. For about two hours, I had panic attack after panic attack with all it's scary symptoms until I went to the emergency room and stabilized, i even managed to fly back on the the same day evening.

It's been two months since then, and I‚Äôm living with panic attacks‚Äîsome are manageable, while others are full-blown, with all the scary symptoms. Along with intense anxiety, existential thought, and severe DP/DR detachment, it‚Äôs been a challenging time, I visited a psychiatrist a month ago, who prescribed me escitalopram drops. I reached the therapeutic dose of 15mg (30 drops) two weeks ago, and I've noticed some better days and moments. I‚Äôve tried this medication in the past (years ago), but I was too young and careless, not giving it a proper chance. I even stopped it on my own. Now, I‚Äôm focused on being more attentive to my health and more responsible with the medication.

Right now, my goal is to feel like myself again, take care of my mental health, and simply feel better‚Äîdespite my brain constantly dwelling on thoughts of time, death, the meaninglessness of life, and how random it all seems. Even the reality of it can feel absurd at times. But another part of me understands that I need to stay strong. I hope escitalopram (Lexapro) can help as time goes by.

I‚Äôve been trying to get into writing, this is my first short story. please tell me what you think, where I fumbled, what you liked or what I could improve, any feedback is appreciated. I'm still unsure if I should continue the story or just finish it here, so tell me what you think.

The sun was burning half my skin, the other was shaded. I sat on the right corner of a metal bench, half hidden in the shadow of her house. The metal was hot enough to burn when I first sat down but was bearable now. I was reading my book, or at least trying to.

My stomach rumbled, but she was in the kitchen. She‚Äôd been there a while now. Smoke rose from the tip of my cigarette, drawing shapeless faces before it curled lazily in the air. A breeze erased them and crashed against the leaves of the apple tree, prompting their green shadows to dance on the floor beneath. A hummingbird sipped anxiously at sweetened water from its feeder. Mocking me.

I returned to my book. She should be leaving soon. I just needed to wait a little longer. The path from the kitchen to her room didn‚Äôt go through this courtyard, so she wouldn‚Äôt pass this way. I just needed to focus on my book, and time would fly by.

I lit another cigarette; that helped a little. My stomach grumbled. Not enough. Did she decide to eat in the kitchen as well? That would explain why she‚Äôs taking so long. The lady of the fountain was staring at me again. Her accusation was clear as day.

*-What?-*

No answer.

*-I'm not even that hungry.-*

Water tickled lazily from her mouth. I wondered what she was making. Probably making something sweet, something delicious. I could almost smell it. This was ridiculous. I stood up, leaving the half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray. The fountain lady‚Äôs gaze followed me as I marched toward the kitchen ,footsteps echoing on the stone path. The breeze stopped, as if the house was holding its breath.I paused at the door,¬† hand hovering over the handle. I could hear her inside. Hard metal clinking against fragile plates. Running water. She was eating something. But she left the tap open. How careless.

I grabbed the handle, and it made a noise as I moved it slowly. The clinking stopped. Why did she stop? I froze, my fingers tightening around the cool metal. The sound of the tap water continued defiantly. Was she waiting for me to come in? The thought made my stomach twist. Loud enough I was sure she could hear it through the door

For a moment, I considered pushing the door open. But then I heard it‚Äîa faint creak, like she was shifting her weight. She was probably sitting on the left chair of the counter; it always creaked like that.

I let go of the handle as if the metal had turned red hot and stepped back, air rushing out of my lungs in a shaky breath. The fountain lady‚Äôs gaze burned into my back as I turned and headed to my room, my footsteps quick and uneven. Her water trickled louder now, a steady, mocking rhythm that followed me all the way upstairs.

Drop, drop, drop.

\*\*\*

I leaned against the balcony of my room, staring out as the sun hid behind the sea, and still, she was in the kitchen. This was rude. Didn‚Äôt she care that I was starving? How long did she plan to stay there?

I came back down to the courtyard as evening swapped the chirping of birds for the hum of crickets, marking the day‚Äôs end. Grabbing the clean ashtray from the table, I made my way to the metal bench and settled into the right corner once again. The metal felt cool now.

The fountain lady seemed less angry now, judging by her expression. Maybe I just couldn‚Äôt see her properly in the darkness. At least the sun had retreated. Maybe she would soon follow.

It was too dark to read, so I just settled for lighting a cigarette, sneaking another glance in the split second my dim light illuminated her. Nope, still judging me.

I focused on the glow of my cigarette, trying to avoid eye contact. I liked the sound it made when I took a drag. It became boring by the third, so by the fifth, I decided to just close my eyes and enjoy the lukewarm night.

When I came to, shadows had completely enveloped the courtyard. I stood up and left the filled ashtray on the table. I‚Äôd pick it up later.

I turned the corner right before the stairs that led to my room and stepped quietly into the kitchen. The door was left slightly ajar, so I peeked in. Bingo, nobody was in there. I stepped triumphantly into the kitchen, only to find a mountain of plates in the sink.

The fridge was empty, so were the cabinets. I checked the fridge again to see if food had magically spawned in the last thirty seconds. It hadn‚Äôt. I started cleaning the plates from the sink. One by one. I took my time with each. I considered licking her leftovers. My stomach growled in agreement. I'm proud to say my better self prevailed, and there was no plate-licking that night. After I finished cleaning and drying the plates, I checked the fridge again just in case. No luck.

After that, I looked for the sugar; I needed to refill the hummingbird's feeder. It might have been in the pantry, but the door hinge squealed, too loud. I didn‚Äôt dare try.

\*\*\*

I opened my eyes to the sight of my ceiling fan spinning. It was so slow, I didn't even know why I bothered to turn it on. I wondered if her fan was the same. I slept on the right side of my queen-sized bed.

I headed downstairs into the kitchen. She was on the terrace by this time of day, so there was no need to worry about making too much noise. I opened the pantry but couldn‚Äôt find the damn sugar. Too bad‚Äîit seemed the hummingbird was going hungry too.

At least there was coffee. Black, of course. I had no sugar or milk. I drank slowly, tasting the bitterness. My stomach complained‚Äîsomething about coffee not being a full meal.

I started washing my mug but froze when I heard a door open in her room. Wasn't she supposed to be on the terrace? I didn‚Äôt dare make a sound, but the running water from the tap betrayed me. Why was she in her room? Had she woken up late? Had she forgotten something?

Shortly after, I heard the creak of the wooden stairs leading to the terrace. I stopped holding my breath, turned off the tap, finished drying the mug, and headed to the courtyard. Book in hand and coffee drained, I grabbed the clean ashtray from the table to begin my day.

The hummingbird drank from a full feeder, and my stomach rumbled. I lit another cigarette and opened my book where I left off. I tried to focus, but I couldn‚Äôt hear my own thoughts over the sound of the fucking hummingbird wings flapping. It was giving me a headache.

I looked at the lady of the fountain. I'd never realized how beautiful her features were‚Äîthat small nose, the soft ridges of her jaw, and slightly puffed cheeks. Her lips were slightly parted, like she wanted to whisper a secret, but only water came out.

I flustered slightly and returned to my book. My stomach grumbled. It was getting harder to focus. I stole another look, and she returned it right back. Water trickled from her mouth, falling to her chest, sliding down her stomach, and continuing through her leg. Sunlight reflected softly where water wet her skin. Stone, not skin. Stone.

The light reflecting off the wall somehow became brighter. My eyes bounced from the hummingbird, drinking happily from that sweetwater nectar, back to her mouth. Her lips.

Drop. Drop. Drop.

It was ridiculous‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt hungry. Wings raged against my ear, and my stomach ROARED in response. I could try‚Äîthe hummingbird seemed happy enough.

DROP. DROP. DROP.

I swallowed, as if that was going to help calm my hunger. It only seemed to make it angrier.

Just a sip.

I glanced toward the stairs leading to the terrace.

Nothing.

I stood up and crept until I was at the edge of her domain. I slowly moved my foot over the edge of the pool and stepped into the cold water gathered at her feet. Just inches from her face.

She was slightly shorter than me. I placed a hand on her cold cheek, then tilted my head somewhat opposite hers and closed my eyes, inching forward. Cold water hit my lips., I pressed my lips to hers and opened my mouth. Cold water seeped down my throat. I moved my tongue into her lips‚Äîher water was somewhat sweet. Just enough to be noticeable.

I drank. The more the cold entered my throat, the hotter I felt. I felt it travel down to my stomach. My heart raced. The more I pressed‚Äîthe more my tongue begged and my lips moved‚Äîthe more nectar came out. Water, not nectar. I was breathing harder now, and blood rushed through my body. I traced my other hand to her hip, as if trying to pull her closer to me.

*Creak*

I spun around and saw her foot retreating into her room just as the door closed.

*FUCK*

Did she see me? A drop slid from my lips to my chin and then the floor.

\*\*\*

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring into nothing. My palms were sweaty. In fact, my whole body was sweating. I still felt her cold water in my stomach. I licked my lips. There was a lingering sweetness coating them. The image of her foot retreating into her room played on a loop in my mind. Had she seen me? What would she think?

The sweetness on my lips was faint now, almost gone. I licked them again, trying to hold onto it, but it was no use. Like catching smoke in my hands‚Äîthe harder I reached, the faster it slipped away. I closed my eyes.

I‚Äôd felt proud for not licking those dishes. Funny how quickly dignity fades in the face of‚Ä¶ what, exactly? I wasn‚Äôt hungry anymore. Not really. It was something else. Something harder to name. I needed to move, so I got up and sat by the window, resting my head against the wall, and let the sound of waves crashing against stone fill the silence. In my haste to reach the safety of my room, I‚Äôd forgotten my book. I didn‚Äôt dare go back for it. Great. What was I supposed to do now?

A faint noise came from the wall‚Äîrunning water. But not from the tap. A shower.

She was there, in her room. On the other side of the wall.

The sound was soft, almost imperceptible. I held my breath to listen better. I lost myself in the steady hiss. Distant waves seemed to join the shower's rhythm. I regained my composure, focusing on the gentle rise and fall of my breath. In through my nose, out through my mouth. I closed my eyes and breathed.

In and out.

The sweetwater sat like a pond in my stomach, my inhale rippling its surface.

In and out.

My exhale came out cold.¬† tried to focus‚ÄîI really did. But she was there, naked. Just a wall between us. I told myself not to think about her. So I breathed. And thought of the shower‚Äîthousands of drops falling happily on the blue tiles of the floor. Steam curling up, filling the room. Clinging to the walls, wetting where the stream couldn‚Äôt reach. Turning the cool night air outside into a humid, thick version of itself. It filled the room, fogging up the mirror, making it harder to see. My breathing grew shallow‚Äîgasping, desperate‚Äîas if I tried hard enough, I could breathe the steam instead. Beads of condensation pooled on the ceiling, then fell, joining the steady stream of the shower. I breathed in through my nose, and out came a single drop from my eye. It wanted to join too.¬† I listened more closely to the stream‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt falling directly on the floor. It was touching her first, visiting her skin on its way to the ground. Only to come back as steam, curling around her, embracing her. I breathed in, then out. Tendrils formed around her and dissolved when she moved.

In and out.

She ran her fingers through her hair.¬† Beads of water ran down her skin. Another ran down my cheek. It threatened to overflow the once still pond inside me. So I took one last, deep breath and tried to hold on. The shower stopped. A window opened, letting the steam go. I breathed out and hear a door opening and then closing. All that was left were the remaining drops still clinging to the wall‚Äîrefusing to give up‚Äîbut eventually losing to gravity and rolling down my cheeks. My vision unblurred as the mirror started to clear. A now empty bathroom‚ÄîStill warm. The pond didn‚Äôt overflow from the top; it drained from the bottom, turning into a muddy puddle. I opened my eyes and was met by my empty room an unmoving ceiling fan and the left side of my bed was untouched.

HEATHER ROBINSON


Mac fell in love in under five minutes.

It was disgusting.

‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù he whispered, staring across the lunchroom like he‚Äôd just seen a ghost. Or a celebrity. Or a ghost celebrity.

Kevin followed his gaze, mid-chew. ‚ÄúDunno. New kid?‚Äù

‚ÄúNew girl,‚Äù Don corrected. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in my homeroom. Morgan something.‚Äù

Mac blinked. ‚ÄúMorgan.‚Äù He said it slowly, reverently, like it meant something.

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúJesus, dude. You sound like a Disney prince.‚Äù

Alan, sitting next to me, smirked. ‚ÄúThink he‚Äôs gonna go full Romeo?‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt even have the brain cells to go half Romeo.‚Äù

Mac ignored us, eyes still locked on the girl across the room.

She had dark hair, messy in the way that looked effortless instead of lazy. She was wearing a Def Leppard t-shirt, sitting alone at the end of a table, completely absorbed in her book.

I could already see the gears turning in Mac‚Äôs head.

Don leaned back. ‚ÄúYou should go talk to her.‚Äù

Mac scoffed. ‚ÄúWhat? No. That‚Äôs desperate.‚Äù

Kevin grinned. ‚ÄúSo is staring at her like you‚Äôre in a Hallmark movie.‚Äù

Mac scowled, grabbed his tray, and stood. ‚ÄúI was gonna eat lunch with you guys. But I suddenly remembered I hate you all.‚Äù

And with that, he walked off.

We watched him cross the cafeteria.

Watched him hesitate, moving his weight back and forth, rocking on the heels of his feet, building up courage.

Watched him sit down.

Morgan glanced up at him. Said something.

Mac laughed, not his usual, obnoxious laugh.

A real one.

Kevin nudged me. ‚ÄúTen bucks says he embarrasses himself in the next two minutes.‚Äù

I barely heard him.

Something about the whole thing made my stomach turn like a washing machine in a hurricane.

The thing about being me is that I notice things. It‚Äôs not on purpose, it‚Äôs just how my brain works. I see things other people don‚Äôt and sometimes, things I don‚Äôt want to.

Like how Mac suddenly stopped making fun of me for liking books, because now Morgan liked books.

Like how Don always looked a little exhausted, because he had like a million younger siblings and a mom who worked too much.

Like how Kevin acted like he had the confidence of a game show host, but some days, his jokes were just a little too loud. A little too forced.

Like how Alan‚Äî

Well.

Alan was Alan.

And I really didn‚Äôt want to think about what that meant.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


It happened after school, on the walk home. My parents were off at some ‚Äúmarriage healing summit‚Äù, so there was nobody waiting for me. I was lagging behind, tired, picking at the fraying strap of my backpack.

Kevin slowed down next to me.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

I glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶hey.‚Äù

He was quiet for a second.

‚ÄúYou ever think about leaving?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúLeaving where?‚Äù

He kicked a rock into the street. ‚ÄúHere. Ashwood.‚Äù

I studied him, for a moment, at the way he nervously twisted the hem of his shirt between his nimble fingers. Kevin never talked about serious things. He was always the one with a quick smile, who could make anyone laugh, no matter how bad their day was. And right now, he just looked‚Ä¶ lost.

‚ÄúI dunno,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúSometimes I just feel like‚Äî‚Äù

He stopped, shaking his head.

‚ÄúForget it.‚Äù

I stopped walking. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

He turned towards me, his eyes flickering back and forth like an old television changing channels.

I crossed my arms. ‚ÄúYou can tell me stuff, you know.‚Äù

Kevin grinned, but it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúI do tell you stuff. Like how Mac is definitely gonna name his first kid after Morgan.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúKevin.‚Äù

He hesitated, drawing air into his lungs, like he was preparing for an arctic plunge.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my dad.‚Äù

I exhaled. Kevin never talked about his dad.

‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù He rubbed the back of his neck. ‚ÄúHe‚Äòs all I got, I just‚Äî‚Äù He swallowed. ‚ÄúSometimes I feel like I could set myself on fire, and he‚Äôd only notice if the house burned down too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that.

So I just said: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an idiot.‚Äù

Kevin snorted. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

And for once, he didn‚Äôt have a joke.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


The first time I saw him, I thought he was someone‚Äôs dad.

We were at recess, sitting under the big oak tree by the fence, trading gummy worms and watching Kevin try to throw rocks at the basketball hoop.

Alan was sitting next to me, squinting up at the sky.

‚ÄúYou ever wonder what it‚Äôd be like to be a bird?‚Äù he asked.

I snorted. ‚ÄúWhat, like, specifically a pigeon?‚Äù

Alan grinned. ‚ÄúObviously.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, tossing a gummy worm at his face. ‚ÄúYou are so weird.‚Äù

He caught it and popped it in his mouth.

Something about the way he did it, so casually, I‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know. I just sat there for a moment, watching the wind ruffle his sandy hair. Then my gaze moved upwards and I saw him, standing by the fence. A man, anywhere from his late thirties to mid forties, watching us. No, not watching us, watching Alan, his head tilting gently from side to side. He wasn‚Äôt dressed like a teacher, he wasn‚Äôt standing with any of the parents. He was just‚Äîthere, too still, too patient. Like he was waiting. I felt my stomach twist, a pang of fear and panic tearing through me like a bullet, instantaneous and deadly.

I nudged Alan. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

He turned towards me, a question on his lips.

I nodded toward the fence. ‚ÄúDo you know that guy?‚Äù

Alan glanced over‚Äîand the man was gone, the street empty, with no trace of the shadow he‚Äôd cast, no sign that he‚Äôd never been there.

Alan frowned. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

I swallowed, my throat suddenly very dry.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I muttered, setting down the bag of gummy worms.

But it wasn‚Äôt nothing. The way that man had looked at him‚Äîlike he was starving‚ÄîI knew that something was very wrong.






MAC PETERSON


We weren‚Äôt rich.
Not like Trevor Holloway‚Äôs family, with their vacation homes and private planes.
Not like the families who owned the town, the ones whose last names were etched into the very bones of Ashwood‚ÄîKowalski, Ives, Clifton.
But we had more than most and I didn‚Äôt think much about it until I did.
Until I sat at Alan‚Äôs kitchen table, eating boxed macaroni and hot dogs, while his dad counted crumpled bills under dim yellow light.
Until I spent the night at Heather‚Äôs house and saw the half-finished repairs, the walls that had been stripped bare but never repainted, the roof that always seemed to need fixing.
Until I realized that my house, with its three stories and finished basement, with its leather furniture and fully stocked fridge, wasn‚Äôt normal.
My dad didn‚Äôt wear tailored suits or drive a Cadillac, didn‚Äôt spend his afternoons in a golf club, shaking hands with men who controlled the world from behind polished mahogany desks.
But he wasn‚Äôt like Alan‚Äôs dad, either.
He didn‚Äôt come home with splinters in his hands and sawdust in his hair, didn‚Äôt smell like wood stain and sweat, didn‚Äôt leave behind a trail of half-built houses when the work dried up and the money ran out.
My father‚Äôs hands were soft, smooth, the hands of a man who sat at a desk all day, sifting through numbers and paperwork, speaking in terms of liabilities and assets, things that made other men‚Äôs eyes glaze over when he talked about them.
He ran a construction company, overseeing the accounting or finance wing or something equally mind-numbing.
I never really asked because it never really mattered.
I never had to wonder if the lights would stay on, if there would be food in the fridge, if my parents would ever look at me with that same tight-lipped worry I saw on Alan‚Äôs mom, on Heather‚Äôs dad. The paychecks came on time, the mortgage got paid, and that was all that mattered.
While he was in the office, my mother liked to do everything she could to keep it that way. She liked to throw parties.
Not the kind with plastic cups and cheap beer, not the kind where music blared through busted speakers, where boys in letterman jackets laughed too loud and girls in denim skirts took long drags from stolen cigarettes.
No, my mother‚Äôs parties were curated.
She said it was good for Dad‚Äôs career, that it was important to ‚Äúbe seen,‚Äù that a man didn‚Äôt get promoted just by being good at his job‚Äîhe got promoted by knowing the right people.
Mayor Kowalski, the school superintendent, the owners of half the businesses in town. They all passed through our house at some point, sipping whiskey in the living room, talking in low voices while the stereo played jazz records my mom didn‚Äôt actually like but thought made us sound cultured.
She moved through the rooms with a glass of wine in hand, laughter just the right amount of airy, smile just the right amount of warm, playing the part of a woman who loved entertaining, who loved people, who thrived on hosting and hospitality.
But I saw the way she looked at them when she thought no one was watching, the way she would roll her eyes at their jokes, the way her smile would slip for just a second before she pinned it back into place.
Heather hated those nights.
She called my mom a fake Stepford wife, and maybe she wasn‚Äôt wrong.
But I didn‚Äôt mind them. I liked seeing my dad laugh, even if it was mostly for show. I liked the comfort of knowing that when I went to bed, the world outside my window wasn‚Äôt waiting to fall apart.






DON SPOONER


Some people have a knack for making themselves the center of attention.

Mac, for example, couldn‚Äôt go a full day without some big plan or scheme that usually ended with him limping home covered in dirt. Kevin had a way of making everything into a joke, loud and fast-talking and impossible to ignore. Heather could hold a room‚Äôs attention without even trying, and Alan‚Äîwell, Alan didn‚Äôt always try, but people always noticed him anyway.

Me?

I was the guy holding everything together.

I had to be.

With my three younger brothers at home, I was the one making sure the cereal didn‚Äôt run out, that my mom didn‚Äôt forget to pick up my brothers from daycare after working a double shift, that no one left their socks in the sink again (don‚Äôt ask).

That kind of thing doesn‚Äôt just switch off when you leave the house.

So when Kevin looked like he was struggling, I was the one who let him copy my homework even though I knew he‚Äôd get half of it wrong anyway.

When Mac‚Äôs new thing with Morgan started actually getting serious, I kept my mouth shut even though part of me wanted to tell him he was an idiot.

And when Heather looked worried‚Äîreally worried‚Äîfor the first time in years, I noticed.

And I listened.

It was three days after she saw the man watching Alan.

We were walking home from school‚Äîme, Heather, Alan, and Kevin, since Mac had started leaving early to ‚Äúwalk Morgan home‚Äù (stare at her like a lovesick golden retriever).

Heather had been quiet all day. She‚Äôd barely said anything at lunch, even when Kevin was in rare form, going on about how he was going to grow up to be a ‚Äúhighly respected businessman‚Äù who wore suits and said things like Let‚Äôs circle back to that.

She kept looking at Alan and I knew she was building up to something. Finally, after we‚Äôd passed Miller‚Äôs Hill, she stopped walking.

Alan looked back. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Heather hesitated. Then she turned to me.

‚ÄúBack me up on this,‚Äù she said.

I frowned. ‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù

She took a deep breath.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with this town.‚Äù
We glanced at each other, taken aback but not totally surprised. Heather had always been the most  inquisitive amongst us, always questioning the rules of life as she encountered them. We‚Äôd never paid it much mind, that‚Äôs just how she was. But now, the look in her eyes was something different altogether, something unprecedented.
Kevin raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôve been reading too many of your creepy books.‚Äù

Heather ignored him. ‚ÄúA few days ago, I saw a guy watching Alan at school.‚Äù

Alan‚Äôs face scrunched up. ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who he was. He wasn‚Äôt a teacher, he wasn‚Äôt a parent‚Äîhe was just there.‚Äù She shifted her weight. ‚ÄúAnd then he wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Alan frowned. ‚ÄúYou sure you weren‚Äôt imagining things?‚Äù

Heather looked at him.

And I knew, right then, that she wasn‚Äôt lying.

Kevin was still skeptical. ‚ÄúEven if there was some guy, maybe he was just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Heather interrupted.

She turned back to me.

‚ÄúDon,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou get it, right? You‚Äôve seen all those creepy-ass posters at Carson‚Äôs. That can‚Äôt be normal. I don‚Äôt think they have that many missing kids in other towns, at least they don‚Äôt in any of the movies I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

I hesitated, then I nodded. Because the truth was, I had thought about it, maybe not in the same way Heather did, but I‚Äôd noticed certain things too. The way my mom never talked about growing up here, no matter how much my brothers asked. The way the streetlights flickered all at once, like they were connected to some invisible signal. The way the air hummed sometimes, even when it was dead quiet.

Heather exhaled. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

Alan, clearly uncomfortable, rubbed the back of his neck. ‚ÄúOkay, but‚Äîwhat do you think is happening?‚Äù

Heather shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I want to find out.‚Äù

Kevin groaned. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna end up in a padded cell, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Heather ignored him.

Instead, she turned back to me.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, Don?‚Äù

I exhaled.

I thought about my brothers, about my mom coming home exhausted every night, about the feeling I sometimes got that I was standing on the edge of something big, an unseen crevasse that challenged me to step into its maw and be devoured.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna talk to Mac.‚Äù

I cornered him at the gas station later that night.

He was at the slushie machine, mixing cherry and blue raspberry like a man who had no respect for tradition.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I began, a thousand questions on my lips.

He sighed. ‚ÄúHeather got to you, huh?‚Äù

I frowned, caught off-guard. ‚ÄúYou believe her, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Mac stirred his drink, staring at the counter. ‚ÄúI believe she believes it.‚Äù

I studied him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve noticed things too, though.‚Äù

Mac hesitated.

Then‚Äîvery quietly‚Äîhe said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow expectantly. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why are you acting like this isn‚Äôt a big deal?‚Äù

Mac scoffed. ‚ÄúBecause everything is a big deal to Heather‚Äîand she is gonna end up in a padded cell at this rate.‚Äù

I crossed my arms. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know the truth?‚Äù

Mac took a deep breath, rubbing his temples.

Then, finally, he muttered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I do.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt expecting that. Mac didn‚Äôt say anything else. He just grabbed his slushie off the counter and left.


I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

Not because of Heather‚Äôs theories. Not because Mac was scared. Because of that‚Ä¶ feeling, that gripped the base of my stomach and blossomed into an azalea of anxiety in the center of my chest.

I lay awake, listening to the sounds of my house‚Äîmy brothers snoring, the fridge humming, the faint creak of the wind against the windows.

And beneath all of that‚Äî

That hum.

Low and deep, like the sound the earth makes before a storm.

I sat up, reluctantly leaving the warmth of my bedsheets. Cautiously, slowly, I walked across the darkened room‚Äîstepping on a minimal amount of legos on the way over‚Äîand looked out the window.

The street was empty, the cracked asphalt illuminated by a single streetlight, but I felt it. 

A‚Ä¶ presence.

Waiting.

Hunting.






HEATHER ROBINSON


I didn‚Äôt bring my friends home if I could help it.
Not because my parents were bad people, but because they were loud.
My father had been a Navy Seal before he was anything else. Before he was a husband, before he was a father, before he was a man who sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a pistol within reach.
And he never let me forget it.
‚ÄúHeather, you gotta be tougher than the rest.‚Äù
‚ÄúHeather, you gotta stand your ground.‚Äù
‚ÄúHeather, you never let a man make you feel small.‚Äù
I used to think he was talking about boys, but now, I‚Äôm not so sure.
He woke up at five AM every morning, even when he didn‚Äôt have to. He cleaned his guns twice a month, even when they weren‚Äôt dirty. He talked about ‚Äúthe war‚Äù like it was still happening, like it had settled into his bones and refused to leave. He kept the TV on the news, kept the police scanner running in the background, and listened to the world like it was a ticking bomb just waiting to go off.
Because in his mind, it was and he wanted to be ready.
My mother loved my father. That much was obvious, but she didn‚Äôt take his bullshit.
She would roll her eyes when he went off on one of his ‚Äúback in my day‚Äù rants, when he talked about how the world was going to hell in a handbasket, how the government was corrupt, how the only thing keeping us all from total collapse was the thin thread of men who still knew how to fight.
She called him paranoid, she called him dramatic, but she never contradicted him in front of me.
Not once.
Because deep down, I think she was afraid he might be right. I saw it in her face when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking, the tension in her shoulders whenever the phone rang late at night. The way she would stare out the window, watching the road, waiting.
Like she was expecting something, that one day, my father‚Äôs fears wouldn‚Äôt just be theories. That one day, the world outside wouldn‚Äôt be something she could roll her eyes at anymore.







ALAN RUSSELL


One of my earliest memories is of my front door.

It was mahogany, a firm, sturdy door, shaven smooth by hours of hard work. My father had made it himself, pouring his sweat and his lifeblood into the walls of our home.

I remember the way it shook and rattled, completely at odds with the calm, brisk knock that had preceded it. I remember my father‚Äôs confused shuffle as he walked to the front door, pausing a moment to unlatch all the deadbolts before swinging it wide open to our mysterious guest.

The man wasn‚Äôt tall by any means‚Äîabout average height‚Äîand well-dressed, his tweed suit and maroon tie making him look more like a fatherly history professor than the standard door-to-door salesman. He tipped his hat towards the spot where I watched from beneath the stairs, a wry grin spreading across his face‚Äîtoo wide, too big. His handsome face stretched unnaturally, revealing a set of large white teeth.

He said something to my father, but his voice was wrong.

It had an accent I couldn‚Äôt place‚Äîold, like someone from the cartoons my dad used to put on for me.

I turned back to my Lincoln Logs, carefully placing a log upon the precarious frame of a cabin. I wanted to build a second story. I wanted to live in a big house‚Äîone with a school and water that didn‚Äôt come from the creek.

As I reached for another handful of logs, my mother‚Äôs voice rose in recognition‚Äîloud, too loud. I covered my ears and crawled out from under the stairs, moving toward the kitchen. I opened the pantry door and gazed up longingly at the racks of preserves, my eyes settling on the mason jar of strawberry jam.

Glancing around furtively, I gripped the lowest shelf and started climbing, pulling myself up, my feet scrambling for a hold. The voices outside the pantry grew sharper, but I ignored them. I was almost there.

My fingers wrapped around the jar, scooting it toward me inch by inch. The lid was tight, but I wrestled it off, the luscious smell of sugar filling my nose. My fingers sank into the sticky jam, and I shoved as much as I could into my mouth, figuring I only had a few moments before my dad found me and all the fun would be over.

The pantry door creaked open.

I turned, my mouth still full, my fingers and face sticky with strawberry preserves.

My parents stood there, as disheveled and tired as I‚Äôd ever seen them.

My father‚Äôs shirt was torn from the collar to the waist, his face smudged with black handprints, his hair sticking up on one side. My mother‚Äôs hair was stringy and matted, her face pale as my morning cup of milk.

I thought they looked funny. I told them as much.

They didn‚Äôt say anything.

I figured they must have been really angry about the jam until my dad finally spoke, his voice as tired as he looked.

‚ÄúSon, we‚Äôre moving again.‚Äù


I hadn‚Äôt thought about it much, at least not until Heather went on her rant about ‚Äústrange things‚Äù happening around town. Speaking of which, the next morning, Morgan‚Äôs dad dropped her off at school. I hadn‚Äôt paid much attention to him before. He drove a truck, worked late, and always seemed busy. But that morning, as Morgan climbed out of the passenger seat, her father sat there gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white.

His fingers were twitching, his face covered in the unkempt stubble of a man with a terrible work-life balance. His mouth moved like he was whispering something to himself.

Then, as if sensing my gaze, he turned sharply and locked eyes with me.

I froze.

For a second, we just looked at each other.

Then Morgan slammed the door shut, and the spell broke. Her dad pulled away from the curb, driving off without another glance. Morgan didn‚Äôt seem to notice anything was wrong, but I did.

And the worst part?

That same feeling crept into my chest‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd felt all those years ago, watching my father unlatch the deadbolts.

The feeling that something was coming.

So I got suspicious during first period, when Principal Howell knocked on the classroom door, stepped inside, and announced that Sheriff Wilkes would be conducting a safety inspection. It seemed innocuous enough, but I watched him through the window of my classroom door, just in case.

He didn‚Äôt just walk the halls. He checked the locks on the classroom doors. He peered inside the supply closets. He paced the cafeteria like he was looking for something or someone. When his eyes flicked toward the window, I snapped my head down to my desk.

It was then, looking down at my desk, littered with science assignments that I could not be less interested in, that I made up my mind. There were too many ‚Äústrange things‚Äù happening in a row for me to be able to maintain my skepticism about Heather‚Äôs theories.



My dad was at the kitchen table when I asked.

It had been gnawing at me ever since I saw the way Morgan‚Äôs dad looked at the school, white-knuckling the steering wheel like something bad had already happened. I decided I would need to be very clever about how I asked, so I carefully planned out how I‚Äôd make a casual comment that perfectly led into the real reason for the conversation.

‚ÄúHey, Dad. People ever go missing around here?‚Äù

My father didn‚Äôt look up right away. He was working through a pile of bills, the edge of his cigarette burned low in the ashtray. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn town,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHave there been missing people?‚Äù

My dad frowned, setting his pen down. He glanced at my mother, who was washing dishes at the sink, then back at me.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs this coming from?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI just‚Äî‚Äù I hesitated. ‚ÄúSomeone at school said something about it. About there being kids who left and never came back.‚Äù

My dad exhaled through his nose, reaching for his cigarette. ‚ÄúSmall towns talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs not true?‚Äù

His father was quiet for a moment, rolling the cigarette between his fingers before finally looking at me. ‚ÄúPeople move away all the time. They leave in the middle of the night, maybe don‚Äôt tell their friends, maybe don‚Äôt tell anyone at all.‚Äù He shrugged. ‚ÄúHell, I left my hometown when I was eighteen and never went back. It happens, I wouldn‚Äôt lose sleep over it.‚Äù

I nodded, but something about the way my father said it didn‚Äôt sit right with me.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôre distracted,‚Äù Heather said.

I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

We were sitting in the library, supposedly working on a history project. Mac and Morgan were whispering to each other across the table, and Kevin was pretending to read while actually doodling in the margins of his notebook.

Heather was watching me.

I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not distracted.‚Äù

I was supposed to be studying, but Heather was too close.

We were sharing a textbook, heads bent over the same page. Her curls brushed against my arm every time she shifted, and I was suddenly very aware of how good she smelled.

She turned a page, her shoulder knocking into mine. ‚ÄúAlan, are you even reading?‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

She groaned. ‚ÄúGod, you‚Äôre hopeless.‚Äù

Before I could argue, she leaned in closer, lowering her voice. ‚ÄúIf I get an A on this test and you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm never letting you live it down.‚Äù

I smirked. ‚ÄúYou say that like I ever get A‚Äôs.‚Äù

Heather rolled her eyes. Then, before I knew what was happening, she reached up and ruffled my hair.

I went stiff.

She pulled away, grinning. ‚ÄúCome on, pay attention.‚Äù

I stared at her, my face burning. Heather closed the massive textbook, sending dust particles flying towards Kevin, who wrinkled his nose a few times before sneezing. The loud sound snapped me out of my stupor. She scooted her chair over towards the softly humming microfilm machine, scrolling through‚Ä¶ something. Old articles from twenty, thirty, forty years ago flickered across the screen.

Heather turned towards me, her bright green eyes meeting mine. I stared back, not unlike a deer in headlights.

‚ÄúDo you remember when we were talking about those missing posters?‚Äù Heather asked.

I thought back to Carson‚Äôs convenience store, to the rumpled leaflets haphazardly nailed onto the side of the wall. 

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Heather murmured. ‚ÄúI pulled everything I could find on missing persons cases.‚Äù

I followed suit, moving my chair over and leaning in, scanning the headlines as she flipped through them.

LOCAL GIRL, 14, MISSING SINCE JUNE

FAMILY OF MISSING TEENAGER MOVES OUT OF ASHWOOD

ASHWOOD PD: ‚ÄòNO FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED‚Äô

WALKER FAMILY DISTRAUGHT: WHITNEY MISSING

ANOTHER RUNAWAY: 12 YEAR OLD GONE WITHOUT TRACE

Every case was the same.

A kid disappears, their parents report it. The town shrugs it off like a stray flea.

‚ÄúNo foul play,‚Äù I muttered, scanning the articles. ‚ÄúThey always say that.‚Äù

Heather nodded, fingers tapping against the desk. ‚ÄúAnd no details. No one ever says where they were last seen, what they were wearing, anything, just that they‚Äôre missing.‚Äù

Heather turned towards me then, eyes sharp. ‚ÄúYou think someone‚Äôs covering it up?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

But something felt off.

Heather scrolled further. The dates stretched back decades, the pattern repeating every summer like a cycle, the hungering beast of abandonment claiming its long list of victims.

And that was when she froze.

I followed her gaze to the screen.

It was a grainy black-and-white photograph of a group of teenagers, maybe sixteen or seventeen. One of them was irrefutably and unmistakably Governor Clifton, noticeably missing his trademark gray curly hair and reddened nose.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Heather breathed.

‚ÄúHe looks so young.‚Äù I said, peering closer at the clean-shaven teenager on the flickering monitor. I didn‚Äôt recognize any of the other people in the photo with him, a dark-haired woman with a smile that could melt glaciers and a thin, red-haired boy in a tight-fitting jacket.

‚ÄúWho do you think disappeared?‚Äù I asked, looking back at Heather.

‚ÄúMy money‚Äôs on her.‚Äù Heather said, pointing one long finger at the brunette woman.

‚ÄúWhy her?‚Äù I asked, confused.

Heather looked at me, puzzled. 

‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you noticed? They‚Äôre nearly all girls.‚Äù

I glanced back at the list of articles, scanning the names.

‚ÄúHuh. That‚Äôs weird.‚Äù



That night, I had trouble sleeping.

My mind was far from Heather‚Äôs budding conspiracies. Instead, I kept thinking about what Heather had done before that. About the way the corners of her mouth curled, the way her eyes glimmered with an irrepressible mirth when I accidentally performed my best impression of a beet.

I stared at the ceiling, my heartbeat loud in my ears. I leaned over, peering out my window, looking at the dark sky, my eyes struggling to adjust to the dark. Out at the edge of my vision was a shape I could barely make out, like an oddly shaped tree. As my sleep-addled eyes adjusted, I could make it out more clearly.

A man, standing motionless in the field, silently watching. Waiting for a glimpse of my small, pale face in the window.

I jumped backwards in shock, quickly pressing my face against the glass to get a better view, but nothing was there. The field was empty.


That night, I made the decision that I was going to start carrying a pocketknife. Not because I thought I‚Äôd need it, but because, for the first time in my life, I felt like I should. I found my dad‚Äôs old knife in the junk drawer‚Äîa small, folding blade, a little rusty but still sharp. It felt good in my hand, solid, like I had something.

I tucked it into my pocket and looked at myself in the mirror.

Twelve-year-old Alan Russell.

Small. Skinny. 

But not helpless.

I didn‚Äôt know what was coming.

But I wasn‚Äôt going to be scared.

Not again.







DON SPOONER


The thing about living in a town like Ashwood is that nothing ever happens.

Sure, sometimes weird stuff goes down‚Äîbut nothing big. Nothing that makes people actually talk.

This, though? This was different.  

Governor William Clifton was here. 

Now, I‚Äôm not the kind of guy who pays much attention to politics. Mostly because it‚Äôs boring, and I‚Äôd rather spend my time doing literally anything else. But even I knew who Clifton was. Everyone did.

He was Arkansas‚Äô governor‚Äîthe kind of guy who was on TV a lot, shaking hands, giving speeches, always looking like he was about to sell you a truck. He was one of those politicians who talked big‚Äîabout jobs, about opportunity, about making Arkansas better. And apparently, he was coming to Ashwood to talk about fracking.

Fracking had been around in Ashwood for years. Everyone knew somebody who worked at one of the drill sites. My uncle had been on a rig since before I was born. It was just part of life here‚Äîlike church on Sundays or football on Fridays.

But Clifton wasn‚Äôt here to talk about what was already happening.

He was here because he wanted more, and they pulled out all the stops for him.

Mom had been talking about it for weeks, and now that the day had finally come, she was buzzing with excitement, herding me and my brothers‚ÄîNathan, Oliver, and little Sam‚Äîout the door like we were late for church.  

‚ÄúCome on, Donny,‚Äù she called, adjusting Sam on her hip as she locked the door behind us. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to miss this!‚Äù  

I wasn‚Äôt so sure. The sun was hot, the air sticky, and the last thing I wanted was to be packed into a crowd while some politician gave a speech. But Mom was thrilled, and so was just about everyone else in town.  

When we got to the town square, I was shocked at how many people had shown up. It felt like the whole town had gathered‚Äîfamilies, shop owners, even old folks who barely left their houses. The diner had set up a table with lemonade, kids were weaving through the crowd, and there was this electric feeling in the air, like something important was about to happen.  

Mom found a good spot near the front, and I stood beside her, balancing Oliver on my hip while she held Sam. Nathan, who was seven and took himself way too seriously, stood next to us with his arms crossed, wearing a frown like an article of clothing, aimed at the courthouse steps.  

And then the governor appeared.  

Governor William Clifton walked onto the stage like he owned the place, like he‚Äôd been born and raised on Ashwood soil. His silver curls caught the sunlight, and his suit was crisp and perfect, not a wrinkle in sight. He smiled that big, pale open smile‚Äîthe kind that made people feel like they already knew him.  

He approached the podium slowly, letting the crowd settle, his hands placed firmly on either side as he looked out at us like we were old friends catching up after years apart.  

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow,‚Äù he began, his voice smooth and easy, ‚Äúwhen I come to Ashwood, I don‚Äôt feel like a visitor.‚Äù  

A few people chuckled, nodding.  

‚ÄúThis town, these streets, these people‚Äîyou remind me of home. You remind me of where I came from, back when I was just a kid runnin‚Äô around barefoot, gettin‚Äô into trouble, causin‚Äô my mama all kinds of grief.‚Äù  

More chuckles. Someone in the back whistled.  

He grinned, shaking his head like he was remembering some long-ago mischief.  

‚ÄúBut the thing about towns like this,‚Äù he continued, his voice dipping just slightly, taking on a more serious tone, ‚Äúis that the world tends to forget about us.‚Äù  

A murmur ran through the crowd.  

‚ÄúThe big cities get the attention, the money, the new businesses, while places like Ashwood? We work hard. We do the jobs nobody else wants to do. And we do ‚Äòem well.‚Äù He gestured broadly, as if inviting us to look around at our own town, to recognize the truth in what he was saying.  

‚ÄúAnd I tell ya, every year when I come down here for my annual stay at the Phoenician Grove, I am reminded‚Äîy‚Äôall are the backbone of this state. Y‚Äôall make this place what it is.‚Äù  

Mom clapped. So did a few others.  

Clifton gave a slow nod, as if he were deeply moved. ‚ÄúAnd I think it‚Äôs time we gave somethin‚Äô back.‚Äù  

The applause built. People liked the sound of that.  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to announce,‚Äù Clifton continued, spreading his hands like he was bestowing a blessing, ‚Äúthat we‚Äôll be expandin‚Äô our fracking operations right here in Ashwood. More jobs, more opportunity, more prosperity. And with that, we‚Äôll be buildin‚Äô a better, bigger Ashwood.‚Äù  

A cheer rippled through the crowd. Some folks clapped, some whistled.  

Nathan tugged at my sleeve. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs fracking?‚Äù  

I shrugged. ‚ÄúIts like drilling for gas, I think.‚Äù  

Mom squeezed my shoulder, beaming. ‚ÄúThis is going to be so good for the town, Donny.‚Äù  

Clifton raised his hands, calming the crowd just enough.  

‚ÄúNow, I know what some of y‚Äôall might be thinkin‚Äô,‚Äù he said, lowering his voice like he was letting us in on a secret. ‚ÄúChange can be scary. Nobody likes to wake up and feel like their world is shiftin‚Äô under their feet.‚Äù  

He leaned forward, his eyes sweeping the crowd.  

‚ÄúBut I promise you this. This ain‚Äôt just some business decision made in an office somewhere. This is for you. This is for your families, for your futures. This is gonna make Ashwood the kind of place people want to come to. And it‚Äôs gonna start today.‚Äù  

More cheers. Louder now. Mom was clapping harder than before.  

‚ÄúAnd the best part?‚Äù He let the moment hang, grinning. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre startin‚Äô right now.‚Äù  

He turned to a man in a dark suit, standing near the courthouse steps. The man nodded, lifting a walkie-talkie to his mouth.  

A low, mechanical groan rumbled from the mountains.  

The ground beneath my feet vibrated. It started slow, like the hum of a train in the distance, but then it grew‚Äîdeep, steady, pulsing through the dirt, through my bones. A few people turned, glancing toward the hills.  

I turned, too.  

The drilling had started.  

And Governor Clifton just kept smiling.

This relative has apologized and is trying very hard to mend our relationship, I really want to forgive and restore our friendship.
Unfortunately this has affected my mental health.  My mind constantly brings up thoughts of the past and all the suffering I experienced for taking a different path in life which was influenced by my relative.  
I know I can't undo the past and these disturbing thoughts of the past serve no purpose other that making me feel terrible with resentment and anger. I love my relative and want to move past the resentment.

With the help from many of you in this sub (big Thank You) I have included mindfulness meditation practice in my daily routine and learned how to create distance from these troubling thoughts to release them as an observer, this has helped tremendously during the day, however in the morning, upon waking up, I feel a strong pull into these negative thoughts and find myself ruminating, arguing in my head with my relative and imagining all the opportunities I missed out.  I usually get 6 to 7 hours of good sleep so I don't think it's lack of sleep.  
After my morning coffee and as the day progresses it gets better.

Is morning rumination a common occurrence?

My main complaint about this puzzle is that the lower middle section has very poor resolution compared to the others and I think they may have accidentally used the wrong file size or something. It‚Äôs noticeably pixelated. 

I started by doing the pixelated section to get it out of the way, but ironically it took the longest because I didn‚Äôt sort all the pieces at first. After sorting them by section, everything moved really quickly.

Tale #1: Shattered

Dramatis personae: pretty much just me.

I was at the desk minding my own business, when a guest tells me that there‚Äôs a window broken downstairs. I lock up my computer and cash drawer and ask him to show me where it is.

We go down to the second floor, and I see a quite-comprehensively shattered window, and a giant piece of ice. Apparently the ice fell off the roof on just the right trajectory to hit the window in a vulnerable spot. 

I thank the guest for bringing that to my attention, and clean up the shattered glass. Then I cover up the hole with cardboard we were going to recycle anyway and secure it with painting tape. I would‚Äôve preferred duct tape, but painting tape is better than nothing.

Teal deer: Rogue ice breaks a window.

Tale #2

Dramatis personae in order of appearance:

Me: your narrator

DB: Douchebag

DG: Douchebag‚Äôs girlfriend

POP: Person On Phone

Around two hours later, I‚Äôm running the audit when the phone rings. Someone‚Äôs in the vestibule, they want to know if there are any rooms left. It so happens, there are. I press my little button to admit them. 

Me: Just a quick FYI though, I can‚Äôt see my availability right now because I‚Äôm in the middle of the audit, but I‚Äôll be glad to check afterwards.

DB: Off the top of your head, you‚Äôre not completely full, are you?

Me: I‚Äôm not sure of the exact number, but I‚Äôd say around half.

DB goes and sits down with his girlfriend.

DB: What‚Äôs your name?

Me: Mazda.

DB: You know, my last name is Schmilton, and you should treat a Schmilton with respect. But I guess everyone does it differently.

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not, and frankly I don‚Äôt care. This guy‚Äôs behavior already smells of bullshit, a sensation aggravated by the fact that he‚Äôs going to the ATM in the lobby.

The audit is finished by now.

Me: Okay, I have something with two doubles for $RRR plus tax. After taxes, that becomes $DDD. 

DB: I‚Äôm a Schmilton, what kind of leeway do you have with the price? I‚Äôm seeing $LLL online.

Me internally: Oh here we go!

Me to DB: If you have a Schmilton Accolades account, I can reduce it to $HHH before taxes, but that‚Äôs as low as I can go.

DB: And checkout is tomorrow, right?

Me: You could check in now, but it would be a two-night stay if you wanted to check out tomorrow the 27th, because this is currently 25 going into 26. 

DB: But I stayed here a few weeks ago, and the person then said I could check in early for a fee less than a full night.

Me: Again, if you‚Äôre checking in for the 26 going into the 27, then what you‚Äôre seeing online would be the price. 4AM would be considered a late arrival for the 25, and that‚Äôs  $RRR. The $LLL you see online would be checking in on the 26.

DB: And today is the 26!

Me: On the clock it is, but as far as my system is concerned it‚Äôs still the night of the 25.

DB: The other night shift lady, the one with short hair, said we could check in if you have a room ready no matter what time it is! She made it easier for us to stay, and you‚Äôre making it harder! It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre trying to make sure we don‚Äôt stay!

DB steps out to make a phone call, leaving his girlfriend sitting in the lobby. I excuse myself to go make coffee for breakfast service.

DG comes looking for me in the pantry.

DG: I‚Äôm sorry for his asshole behavior. I know you‚Äôre bound by policy.

Me: I appreciate that. Thank you.

DG: Can we pay cash?

Me: We can take cash at check-out, but for check-in, we need a card that authorizes for the entire stay plus incidental hold.

I go back to the desk, and DB has someone on the phone.

DB: Explain to this employee what you told me.

POP: Early check-in is doable if you have rooms ready, right?

Me: That‚Äôs correct, but only after checkout time. In our case, that‚Äôs after 11. Checking in before that time is considered the same as if it arrived the previous night, which would incur the rate and tax of the previous night.

POP hangs up.

DB: You‚Äôre telling me something different. That‚Äôs messed up. You‚Äôre messing with us.

Me: I‚Äôm just following policy. Anything else I can assist you with?

DB sees that there‚Äôs no point in trying to bully me. He and his lady shuffle away into the night. Good, dealt with, yay!

I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel dedicated to Video Essays. These are not exceptionally informative of whatever, but sort of a random thoughts types. Think of them as more articulated versions of brainstorms over morning coffee.

I have jotted down the scripts of them and proofread them over and over and I think Video Essay on a YouTube is the best medium to get them out, rather than putting walls of text on Blogging Sites.

So, I settled down to recording, and it was a disaster. I could ot get my looks, voice or tone to match my vision. Made multiple attempts, but none of them matched the vision I had for the video versions.

So now I understand that I have no talent in the areas of Screen Presense, Delivery, Diction or Accent - at least in front of the camera. So frustraded, I tried a few AI powered TTS Engines, and I was genuinely surprised that how brilliantly the voice and delivery matched the expectations. So now, I have my scripts in the Audio format, just the way I wanted. I know, they are AI TTS, but at least they're better.

But still, the visuals are a big issue. What sort of visuals should I do ? I'm completely clueless about that, can anyone help me in that regard ?

Just to clarify, the audience for this is very limited, it's meant to be sparking a conversation and not out there just to get subs or views. But then again, for me, personally, the production quality of the videos could at least try to do the justice to the scripts.

I'm tired of washes. I'm tired of those coffee stains, that dirty effect that's bound to appear and has to be corrected even if you're deliberately trying to apply your wash only in the recesses. And I'm tired of correcting those endless mistakes that, you know, happen when you correct your previous mistakes... It's just not fun at all.

I am tired of speed/contrast paints because they take a long time to dry, run where they shouldn't and don't cover flat surfaces well. Applying them is pure stress for me - you have to do it quickly AND carefully, otherwise you will either get streaks or stain the surface that should be a different color. And finally, the cherry on the cake - you can't just go and correct your mistakes like you would with regular basecoating because this paint is semi-transparent...

Basically, all I want from my miniatures is smooth, bright colors neatly covering all the places where they should be. So... Is it possible to make a model look good with just a base coat? Is there anyone who paints their miniatures this way? Can you give me any advice that might help me? Thanks everyone in advance.",0,1740601548.0,minipainting,13,0.29,False

I went through a lot to figure out the best way to set it up with my available sound output, which ended up being a Samsung sound bar. 

I use a TC-750 professional moving magnetic preamp to get it connected. Once I got all of the connections set up, I haven't had a problem with it.... Until... 

Today, I went to put on an album and low and behold... No sound. I was baffled. Through all of my disconnecting and reconnecting, unplugging and re-plugging in... The only thing I noticed that seemed off was that the power light for the pre-amp won't come on. 

There is a light on the plug itself and also a light on the actual preamp device. When I plug the cable back in, the light momentarily turns back on and then fades. I have not noticed the light coming on at all on the pre-amp. 

Can someone with more knowledge on this than me, let me know if my preamp is what is messed up? Do they go bad over time? I've had it for probably 10-15 years. Maybe the power cable is the issue?

5. Don‚Äôt cheap out on your hotel/airbnb. Rent places that are in affluent areas with security.

Hi fellow passport bros, I had a recent post that was well liked about my international success with women over the years. Thought I‚Äôd wait until that post cooled down before I make this basic guide. 

Again this is a basic guide from my own personal experience and things I‚Äôve taught other passport bros so don‚Äôt take this too seriously as something that‚Äôs set in stone. 

This guide is also location dependent, for example if you‚Äôre going to be in Western or Central Europe it‚Äôs very unlikely you‚Äôll need to strictly follow safety guidelines since the nations are more developed with lower crime rate.

I‚Äôm also surprised a guide like this isn‚Äôt on here so I‚Äôll post one.

BASIC SAFETY GUIDE:

- Don‚Äôt use taxis, use Uber or the local app for transportation. You want an app that can track your route/location. Reason is because a lot of criminals want to be able to cover their tracks when they go about their business 

- Never meet a girl at a location of her choice. You choose the location, specifically a location where there‚Äôs a decent crowd with some basic security. When I go to Brazil I take a girl to a nice mall for a simple coffee date. Affluent areas where the wealthy hang out usually is quite safe as well. You want to pick an environment that you are familiar with. 

- Don‚Äôt wear anything flashy or flamboyant in public areas where it‚Äôs not appropriate. Even a simple $100 USD watch can catch shady people‚Äôs attention. That doesn‚Äôt mean dress like a bum. You can still be fashionable and accessories yourself with cheap and reasonably priced clothing. I wear $20 steel rings and necklaces and still compliments from girls on dates. I only wear nice things when going to a high end venue, other than that I‚Äôm wearing my casual outfit. 

- Even using a cellphone in public can catch peoples eyes especially an expensive phone. In the West, having a new iPhone is very normal but to some lower income nations, you will be seen as a target. If you need to use your cellphone, go inside a store nearby then use it. Otherwise that text or call can wait. 

- Use your hard earned US Dollars to rent a better hotel/AirBnb. Do not cheap out on your living situation when you‚Äôre overseas. Most countries in South America or Eastern Europe have extremely affordable luxury places to stay at. The most expensive place I stayed at was in Los Rosales, Bogota. It was a penthouse that had 24/7 security, aerial view of the city, jacuzzi, fireplace and full amenities for only $100/day. Typically these neighborhoods are very safe and people tend to look out for one another. 

- Have multiple factor authentications on your phone when traveling. I know a guy that was drugged by a Brazilian girl and almost accessed his crypto wallet on his phone. Only reason he was able to stop her was because  she was trying for hours and couldn‚Äôt get through his security settings while he was blacked out. He woke up just in time to stop her. 

- Be extremely selective on who you become friends with when traveling. I only make friends with people that are at a particular level in life even with girls. I only make friends with people that have much to lose if they decide to do something criminal or immoral. A guy that has a good job and a reputation to uphold is less likely to conduct himself as a criminal than someone that has very little to lose. 

Same thing with girls, that‚Äôs why I usually date high end models. They have much more to lose in their life if they decide to do something as dumb as drugging some random foreign guy. 

- Always ask the locals about dangerous areas or activities to stay away from. The locals always know best when it comes to safety knowledge. If there‚Äôs some sort of block party or festival that‚Äôs hyped and filled with beautiful women and locals tell me I better not go, then I simply don‚Äôt go. 

I had an experience where I was hanging out with a group of foreign exchange students. We split up into two groups. One group went to a carnival party in a dangerous area and one group decided to just go to a local bar. The group that went to the carnival party, one guy got attacked and one girl got kidnapped and never heard from her again. My group decided to not go to that carnival party because the locals told me not to go. So what did I do? I simply didn‚Äôt go. 

Let me know if I‚Äôm missing anything, I‚Äôll definitely edit and add more on here!

Safe travels and happy gaming gentlemen!
