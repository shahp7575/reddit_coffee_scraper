I love working out and staying active. I use to be a personal trainer. I mostly do weights now and play some soccer. I have a home gym

Traveling and exploring new places! I have been to a few places in Europe and all over the US, would love travel recs and stories!

Cooking up new recipes in the kitchen is something I really enjoy. I enjoy Italian and various seafood. Im not a great baker though

I love to garden and grow my own veggies in the summer in my small veggie garden. Also have a variety of flowers, bushes and house plants!

In my free time, I play guitar....but not well. I enjoy 90s alternative, classic rock, 00s emo plus a variety of other types!

Hey everyone, hope the day has been treating you well so far! Like it says in the title, I‚Äôm hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it‚Äôs nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I‚Äôm a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I‚Äôm the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that‚Äôs not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let‚Äôs take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",1,1736262712.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

I‚Äôm 32 now, she‚Äôs 23. We were both in relationships at the time, but during those three days, we talked a lot, we liked each other, and we even kissed. Interestingly, neither of us knew the other person was in a relationship. We live a few hours apart, so after the event, things became uncertain. We met once more afterward, and it was very intense, but we didn‚Äôt have sex. Since then, the connection has been interrupted a few times, but life brought us back together, and we met 2-3 more times. We exchanged many messages while we were with our partners, and at one point, she got caught, so she broke off the connection. However, this year, she intentionally showed up at the event where she knew I‚Äôd be. There was no kiss, but she hugged me, invited me for coffee, and the chemistry between us was very hot. After the last event, I thought about reaching out to her again. We exchanged a few emails, which were long and witty, but sometimes it took a week or two for her to respond. I‚Äôm still with my partner, but she has had several relationships since then, yet she always seems to maintain an interest in me. Maybe she‚Äôs always been waiting for me to make a move and leave my partner.

I know the right decision would be to cut off contact with her, because I think about her a lot. The chemistry between us is incredibly strong, and it‚Äôs interesting that no matter how much time passes, we continue the conversation as if we just left off yesterday. That‚Äôs rare.

My question is: why is this relationship good for her, if she is also in a relationship? Why does she write detailed emails, but then take two weeks to reply? Why does she seek my company when we‚Äôre close, even though we haven‚Äôt talked in a long time? Is she just playing with me? Does she enjoy the positive reinforcement?

My ex and I have been broken up for almost 4 months now. We decided to go NC from the beginning and only broke it on Christmas because she (my ex) texted me ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Are you down to get a coffee together?"". I decided to call her and very calmly explained to her that I had no interest in getting back together and most of all, I would have rather kept our NC deal in the forseeable future.   
Now, this took a lot of strenght on my part because I had been SO co-dependent on her in the past and breaking up was a mutual decision we took because we knew our dynamic was toxic, but it really took a toll on my mental stability.  
She wasn't happy, but said she understood where I was coming from.  
Fast forward a week: she blocked me on Spotify. I was like ""ok, maybe she'd rather not have me see the music she is playing, or maybe she just doesn't want to have a connection through music"".   
Fast forward another week: she UNblocked me on Spotify. That made me lol, but I assumed she had changed her mind.   
Fast forward 2 days: she blocked me on whatsapp (the app we used to communicate).   
Now I'm really wondering: what on earth is this woman doing? I NEVER texted her in the 4 months of NC so far, and had 0 plans to do so.   
I am really really doing my best to keep everything civil, mature and as low-key as possible. I am left to wonder what these behaviours mean. I wish we could remain as civil as possible and blocking one another seems so unnecessary since we have already unadded each other on every social media platform.   
I'm not worried or anything, just bitterly amused at the turn of events this breakup is having 4 months in.

I am working on an app-based business idea, and the rub is that I know nothing about app development. I have done a trial run of the process to prove the idea, and it was well-received and got a lot of traction. 

I completed the gALPHA cohort with Gen8tor at Distillery Labs, and the group received it well. 

The tldr about the business is that it is a screening tool that provides a mutual match system to match job seekers and employers aimed at entry-level roles and internships and provides insights on culture, values, and work-style fit. It eliminates the resume and presents the profiles in an anonymized way to employers to help eliminate bias wherever possible. I've piloted using Google Forms and a PowerPoint deck at three job fairs, and there have been 240ish students who have participated, and about 85% got an interview off this process.

I am looking for an app developer interested in a part-time job to help me get this going, and I am willing to share equity in this company for the work. I have pitched the idea twice in community pitches, and it was well received again. I am awaiting confirmation on whether I am accepted into an accelerator program; I can still move forward without the app, but having that would help tremendously secure external investments. 

I would much rather partner up with someone in the Peoria area, as we can grab a coffee, use a whiteboard, and brainstorm a lot easier. If you're interested, hit me up!

We'll use it as our base and definitely be willing to travel to other areas, especially for better food. We enjoy using the Metro and don't mind longer walks for exercise and exploration. 

We love our morning meals, be it sweets at a bakery or something savory. And we enjoy great coffee and drinking chocolate. So let me ask:

1. Are there any bakeries or cafes you'd recommend in (or within walking distance of) Polanco? This would be for morning, either super-early if jet-lag or until about 9am.

2. Alternatively, any destination-worthy bakery or coffee-shop/cafe to which you'd say we should make the pilgrimage?

For context, I dashed to Rosetta as a detour just in time to catch my plane with pastries and bread in hand for my flight home last time, so I'd be interested in anything as good as Rosetta or better.

From the book Sky People - Untold Stories of Alien Encounters in Mesoamerica by Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke, PhD (the author interviewed many indigenous people in South America who saw UFOs and aliens near their villages):

‚ÄúHugo, have you ever seen aliens or spaceships at this site?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI have seen spaceships many times. It does not matter; they come during the day and night. They never come when there are tourists. Personally, I have never seen an alien or a Sky God, or whatever you choose to call them, but the men \[workers\] tell me they frequently land their ships near the Acropolis and get out and walk around. They say they hear their chanting at night.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo they ever describe what they look like?‚Äù I asked.

**‚ÄúSometimes they come as balls of light and turn into men that look just like them. Other times they look like people but are not people.‚Äù**

‚ÄúCan you explain?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey never really talk about it. They are too afraid, but although they have the form of a man, they are not men. That is all I know.‚Äù

(SNIP)

‚ÄúTell me about the Star People who live among us.‚Äù

(SNIP)

‚ÄúWhat do they look like?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúLike you and me. They can look like anyone they like. On this planet they look human. On another they look like the dominant species.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you call them the Shining People?‚Äù I asked.

**‚ÄúIn their true state, they are balls of light.**¬†It is only when they assume human form that you see them. Otherwise you are blinded by them.¬†**Many people never know they have met them. They see balls of light, not realizing that they are actually living forms.‚Äù**

(SNIP)

‚ÄúThe year was 1982. I was thirteen years old. I lived in the same village as Mateo. It was July‚ÄîJuly 15, to be exact. I remember because it was my birthday.

(snip)

The priest nodded.

‚ÄúI woke up in the middle of the night.¬†**I saw flashing lights outside**. It was very strange to me. We didn‚Äôt have electricity in our village, so I had only seen electric lights a time or two. I could even see them flashing with my eyes closed. At first I was very excited. I had never seen anything of such beauty. I tried to wake up my three brothers who slept in the same room with me. They would not awaken no matter how hard I tried.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell her about me,‚Äù Mateo said.

‚ÄúIn time, dear friend. I am trying to tell as it happened. I remember being told, in my mind, to go out the bedroom window. I did as I was told and crawled out the window.¬†**Once outside I saw these colorful balls of light. Some were still in the sky but some were on the ground and when they hit the earth they transformed into men.**

(SNIP)

‚ÄúWhat time was it?‚Äù

‚ÄúLate in the evening. Before dark, but all the tourists were gone. I found myself over a mile from the entrance when the sky became dark and a lightning storm came up. Taking cover in one of the structures, I decided to wait out the storm. It lasted much longer than I expected. Darkness came and I was still inside the ruins. As the rain eased, I decided to head home.¬†**That‚Äôs when a circular craft came out of the clouds and settled in the plaza. Three men, covered in light, came out of the craft. They stopped in front of the Temple of Inscriptions and turned themselves into balls of light.**¬†I watched as they floated upward to the top of the entrance and then they disappeared.‚Äù He paused for a moment and lit a cigarette. ‚ÄúI ran across the plaza, keeping to the edges and out of sight. Before leaving the plaza, I looked back, but the craft was still there. As I walked down the hill toward the town, I saw the craft move above the trees and head south, and then in a second it was gone.‚Äù

(SNIP)

‚ÄúI have seen the lights many times,‚Äù Vincente said. Everyone turned in the direction of an elder who sat at the end of the table. Pax had introduced him to me earlier as one of his closest friends. They could have passed for brothers. ‚ÄúAnyone who has spent time outside at night has seen the lights. Sometimes they come from a craft; sometimes they just appear.¬†**I have seen the Sky People turn into balls of light in front of my eyes. I have also seen them disappear. They have great powers.**¬†I always try to stay away from them. They are dangerous.‚Äù

(SNIP)

‚ÄúPlease, tell me about Adan.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was sixteen the night they took him. Almost a man.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho took him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. I woke in the middle of the night and woke up Gabriella.¬†**I saw three balls of light in the backyard.**¬†On the way out of the house, we woke up Adan, and he followed us. We stood on the porch and watched them for several minutes.‚Äù She paused and sipped her coffee, added sugar to it, and stirred.

‚ÄúYou said you saw lights.‚Äù

**‚ÄúYes. By that time they had become these tall beings. Not quite human, but human-looking.**

(SNIP)

‚ÄúCan you describe the silhouette you saw that night?‚Äù I asked.

From 1968 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Date: 1968

Time: late night

The 5-year old witness (involved in other encounters) was lying down on his bed¬†**when a ball of light came into the bedroom.**¬†It was bluish in color, violet. And it was very bright, but the light did not hurt his eyes.¬†**This light transformed into a woman**. She was about 2.20m in height, the witness was just a small child so it was difficult for him to ascertain her exact size, but she was very tall. She had raid hair and her eyes were green, but water green, transparent green, very strange eyes. She had very white skin and her lips were pin, perfect, her features were perfect. He remembers that she leaned over him and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry‚Äù. He heard that inside his brain (telepathy). ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry everything is going to be OK.‚Äù Then he found himself inside a room with a metallic bed and there was a bubble around him, like a soup bubble, transparent. And the same woman was outside the bubble looking at him. She was ‚Äútalking‚Äù to him, telling him that they were going to put something in him.

From 1969 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Location. Mt. View, California

Date: 1969

Time: late night

One night a hum and a thumping sound in her bedroom awakened the witness.¬†**On opening her eyes she saw very bright balls of light in the corridor at the entrance to her bedroom**. The light was so bright that there were no shadows and her surroundings were almost bleached white. Remarkably her eyes, adjusted instantaneously.¬†**As the balls of light disappeared a loud electrical popping sound was heard and three dark gray figures appeared in their place.**¬†One of the gray figures stood out as the leader and has remained an integral part of the witness experiences. She was then taken onboard a craft and was immediately escorted and placed into a chamber where her physical body was subjected to a vibration that increased in intensity until it felt like every molecule in her body exploded.

Evidence that humans also have the ability to turn into orbs of light:

From the Betty Andreasson UFO abductions in the 1960s and 70s:

In 1978, Betty and Bob heard a whirring sound above their house. Concurrently, both were lifted out of their bodies and, along with others, entered a huge round amphitheater-like enclosure. They were greeted by tall, robed human-looking entities. They found themselves on a high walkway that surrounded the enclosure. Bob was separated from Betty. He was told that he was not as spiritually advanced as Betty and was held to wait for her. During that time¬†**he received answers to many questions that he asked an alien who guarded him**.¬†**Betty, on the other hand, was allowed to participate with a number of light beings in a fantastic procedure that changed her and them into balls of light and back to their light- being form.**¬†During this abduction, Betty glanced down to the floor below and gasped. She saw two daughters and Bob‚Äôs daughter on tables being examined by aliens. She was so troubled by what she saw that the hypnotist had her temporarily forget what she saw. They were returned to their bodies and had no idea of what had just happened to them.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot:

Another strikingly holographic feature of the OBE is the plasticity of the form a person assumes once they are out of the body.¬†**After detaching from the physical, OBEers sometimes find themselves in a ghostlike body that is an exact replica of their biological body**. This caused some researchers in the past to postulate that human beings possess a ""phantom double"" not unlike the doppelganger of literature. However, recent findings have exposed problems with this assumption. Although some OBEers describe this phantom double as naked, others find themselves in bodies that are fully clothed.¬†**This suggests that the phantom double is not a permanent energy replica of the biological body, but is instead a kind of hologram that can assume many shapes.**¬†This notion is borne out by the fact that phantom doubles are not the only forms people find themselves in during OBEs.¬†**There are numerous reports where people have also perceived them- selves as balls of light**, shapeless clouds of energy, and even no discernible form at all.

(SNIP)

In addition to those mentioned by Ring and Fenske, the NDE has numerous other features that are markedly holographic. ,Like OBEers, after¬†**NDEers have detached from the physical they find themselves in one of two forms, either as a disembodied cloud of energy, or as a hologramlike body sculpted by thought.**¬†When the latter is the case, the mind-created nature of the body is often surprisingly obvious to the NDEer.¬†**For example, one near-death survivor says that when he first emerged from his body he looked ""something like a jellyfish""**¬†and fell lightly to the floor like a soap bubble. Then he quickly expanded into a ghostly three-dimensional image of a naked man. However, the presence of two women in the room embarrassed him and to his surprise, this feeling caused him suddenly to become clothed (the women, however, never offered any indication that they were able to see any of this).

(SNIP)

These hologramlike bodies can be remarkably detailed. In the incident involving the man who became embarrassed at his own naked- ness, for example, the clothing he materialized for himself was so meticulously wrought that he could even make out the seams in the material!41¬†**Similarly, another man who studied his hands while in the ND state said they were ""composed of light with tiny structures in them"" and when he looked closely he could even see ""the delicate whorls of his fingerprints and tubes of light up his arms.""**

He doesn‚Äôt say it sounds fun or anything but starts going over what he would even wear since it‚Äôs so cold outside and I tell him what I‚Äôm wearing and suggest he can wear something similar which I know he owns. 

Since he doesn‚Äôt seem excited, to try to make the offer more tempting and because I don‚Äôt want him to sit inside all day I suggested we should also get some coffee since it's snowy and cold outside, that way we can stay warm.

Since I didn‚Äôt get a clear answer as to wether he would bring coffee I ask him if he could buy us some in case he wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring it. He just says I might as well buy it for us. At this point the whole attitude started getting on my nerves. I just replied that he can tell me when he's on his way. 

Since I didn't know if he would bring coffee on his own and frankly since my suggestion of buying coffee seemed like a problem to him, I informed him I had bought the coffee for myself.

1hvtc5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/campingworld/comments/1hvtc5l/rv_furnace/,RV Furnace,"One of the greatest perks to camping in an RV instead of a tent is reliable cooling and heating. It‚Äôs much more comfortable to wake up and prep your coffee in a heated recreational vehicle than climbing out of a wet tent to light your camp stove and try to get a fire going.¬†

Just like residential units, RV heating systems require regular maintenance. But how can you service or repair an RV furnace if you don‚Äôt know how it works? To maintain an RV furnace, you‚Äôll need to know how it works.

**An RV furnace heats air and then circulates it through your RV using a fan.** Most RV furnaces operate on DC power even when your RV is plugged into shore power, allowing them to work at a campground or when camping off-grid.

But there‚Äôs much more to it. So let‚Äôs dive into everything you need to know about operating, servicing, and troubleshooting RV furnaces. ¬†

# How Do RV Heating Systems Work?

There are two main types of RV heating systems: forced air furnaces and hydronic heating systems.¬†

**In forced air furnaces,** outside air for combustion is force-fed through a sealed combustion chamber assembly and discharged to the exterior, while interior air of the RV is moved across a heat exchanger. This design ensures that no products of combustion are mixed with the interior air.

**Hydronic heating systems** use a heated surface to heat water that is distributed to radiators throughout the RV. That surface can be heated by burning fuel (i.e., propane or diesel), an electric element, or using primary engine coolant to heat that surface. Some hydronic heating systems heat potable water and can be used for engine preheating.¬†

***Technician Tip:*** *All RV heating systems should have a data plate containing the manufacturer, make, model, serial number, and input and output (measured in BTUs/hour) of the appliance. This plate helps you identify your appliance for specific service and maintenance procedures. Your owner‚Äôs manual can also help you understand the type of heating system you‚Äôre working with.*

# How Does an RV Furnace Work?

If you‚Äôre working with a forced air RV furnace, heat is distributed throughout your RV using a fan that‚Äôs powered by a small blower motor. Most forced air furnaces burn propane to heat air, but some utilize diesel fuel (more common with hydronic heating systems).¬†

Before we outline the process, let‚Äôs define a few key terms.¬†

**A sail switch** is the first safety switch in an RV furnace. It prevents your furnace from attempting the ignition sequence if the blower motor isn‚Äôt running at a minimum of 75% of its rated speed.¬†

**A limit switch** is the second safety switch. It opens at a preset temperature to prevent overheating. The limit switch is mounted on the heat exchanger or the burner assembly housing. It shuts off the burner but allows the combustion blower to continue running to lower the equipment temperature.

***Safety Tip:*** *The limit switch does NOT act as a thermostat. If your blower never shuts off, but your burner is cycling on and off at regular intervals, your RV should be inspected by a qualified RV technician immediately. This is a symptom of an overheating limit switch, which could result from blockages, faulty components, or LP gas adjustment issues that create a very dangerous situation.*¬†

When you turn on your RV furnace, here‚Äôs a general overview of what happens:¬†

1. The thermostat is turned on and signals for heat.¬†
2. An electrical current is sent from the thermostat to the time delay relay built into the circuit board, which closes to energize the blower motor after a delay of 10-20 seconds. If the motor isn‚Äôt reaching 75% of its rated speed, potential issues include low DC power, a faulty motor, a blocked return air inlet, or a blocked exhaust.¬†
3. When the motor comes up to speed, the sail switch is moved by the airflow to close a micro-switch and continue the circuit. The micro-switch is set to require a minimum fan speed to close. If the motor isn‚Äôt running fast enough, you have a sticky switch, or there‚Äôs an airflow blockage that doesn‚Äôt allow the switch to close ‚Äì the current will be interrupted. This circuit is independent of the thermostat and motor circuit.
4. The sail switch closes, sending power to the limit switch, which then sends power to the circuit board. Under normal operation, the limit switch is closed and opens at a preset temperature to prevent overheating.¬†
5. The circuit board delays ignition for 10-20 seconds, allowing the blower motor to purge any gas remaining in the combustion chamber.

¬†

1. The circuit board opens the gas valve and sends a high-voltage current to the electrode.

¬†

1. If ignition occurs, the electrode senses the flame and sends a current back to the control board, stopping the high-voltage spark and keeping the gas valve open

¬†

1. If ignition doesn‚Äôt occur, the board will go into lockout mode and need to be reset before trying again. Most circuit boards will pause for 20 seconds, then try for 7 seconds. They‚Äôll repeat this three times before going into lockout.

***Technician Tip:*** *A lockout can result from a faulty circuit board, faulty electrode, faulty gas valve, or any combination of these issues. If locked out, conduct a brief inspection (LP gas on, no airflow obstructions, proper voltage, etc.) and then switch the thermostat off and back on. The circuit board should provide three more tries.*¬†¬†

# How to Reset an RV Furnace

To reset most RV furnaces, you‚Äôll simply turn off the power switch, wait about 10 seconds, and turn it back on. If your model doesn‚Äôt have a power switch, turn off the main breaker to the furnace, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back on.¬†

If no breaker exists, remove and reinstall the fuse corresponding to your RV furnace. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to have your RV‚Äôs circuit breaker panel properly labeled.¬†

[Learn more about troubleshooting RV circuit breakers.](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/troubleshooting-circuit-breakers/)

# Where is My RV Furnace Located?

Your furnace location depends on the manufacturer and the floorplan. For example, the furnace in my [Sunset Park Sunlite Classic](https://rv.campingworld.com/product/sunset-park-rv/sun-lite) is located below the refrigerator and to the left of my circuit breaker panel.¬†

Regardless of your floorplan, understand that the furnace itself won‚Äôt be visible. You will see a return air vent (or vents) inside your RV and the air intake/exhaust vent on the RV's exterior. Here‚Äôs an example of what your return air and exhaust vents might look like:¬†

(insert photo)

***Technician Tip:*** *It is a good practice to locate the exhaust vent on the RV's exterior and verify the exhaust is present and clear. We‚Äôve seen too many campers lean a lawn chair against the vent, which could present a fire danger.*

If you‚Äôre [shopping for an RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/finding-your-rv/where-should-you-start-when-shopping-for-an-rv/), it‚Äôs a good idea to look for a model with an exterior access panel to service the RV furnace. This panel isn‚Äôt included on all RVs, especially [entry-level travel trailers](https://rv.campingworld.com/rvclass/travel-trailer-rvs).

# How to Turn on an RV Furnace

Most RV furnaces are controlled by a wall-mounted thermostat. Depending on your make and model, you may have a digital control panel or an analog thermostat.¬†

Most analog thermostats have a small On/Off toggle switch on top, and RVs with a digital control panel will have a display for turning your furnace on and off. In either case, your next step is adjusting the thermostat to a setting above the current ambient temperature inside your RV.¬†

If your furnace is functioning properly, you should hear the blower motor turn on first and feel air blowing out of your interior vents. Within 10-20 seconds, you should hear the pilot light ignite and feel warm air coming out of your vents shortly thereafter.¬†

If you leave your furnace on, it should continue to cycle on and off to keep the inside of your RV at the desired temperature.¬†

# How Much Propane Does My RV Furnace Use?

To operate your RV furnace, you‚Äôll need an adequate propane supply. If you're not already familiar, take the time to learn about [connecting and turning on propane in your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/how-to-connect-propane/).¬†

The amount of propane your furnace uses depends largely on its BTU rating. BTU is short for British Thermal Units, which is a unit of heat measuring how much heat it takes to raise the temperature of one pound of water by 1‚Ñâ at sea level.¬†

A furnace with a higher BTU rating burns propane more quickly than one with a lower rating. So your first step will be determining your furnace‚Äôs BTU rating, measured in BTUs per hour.¬†

Before we get caught up in the numbers below, **remember that your RV furnace won‚Äôt run continuously once you turn it on and adjust the thermostat. It will cycle on and off to regulate the temperature inside your coach.** This is critical to remember when calculating how much propane your RV furnace uses.¬†

Let‚Äôs provide an example:¬†

# RV and Furnace Specs (let‚Äôs use specs for the [Keystone Cougar 30BHS](https://www.keystonerv.com/product/cougar-half-ton/luxury-travel-trailers/floorplans/30BHS))

* **Propane Capacity:** 60 pounds
* **Furnace BTU Rating:** 30,000 BTUs/hr
* **Electric Fireplace BTU Rating:** 5,500 BTUs/hr

# RV Furnace Propane Consumption Calculator

To start, we must remember that propane containers can only be filled to 80% of their total capacity. So while the Cougar‚Äôs advertised propane capacity is 60 pounds, its actual capacity is 48 pounds (60 x 0.8 = 48).¬†

We can calculate the total BTUs of 48 pounds of propane from there.¬†

1 pound of propane = 21,548 BTUs

48 pounds of propane = 1,034,304 BTUs

If our total propane supply accounts for 1,034,304 BTUs, we can divide that by our furnace‚Äôs BTU rating to estimate how many hours our furnace would run before that supply is exhausted.¬†

1,034,304 BTUs / 30,000 BTUs/hr = \~34.48 hours

If we run our furnace and electric fireplace simultaneously, you can actually reduce your rate of propane consumption because you‚Äôre also relying on electric heat:¬†

30,000 BTUs - 5,500 BTUs = 24,500 BTUs

1,034,304 BTUs / 24,500 BTUs/hr = \~42.22 hours

You can insert the appropriate figures from your RV into the example above to calculate how much propane your RV furnace uses. But remember that these calculations are based on an operation of 100% run time.¬†

Other variables, such as local weather and your desired temperature setting, impact your furnace‚Äôs potential operating hours on a full LP supply. For instance, you can roughly double the number of hours your furnace will operate if you estimate a 50% duty cycle (i.e., your furnace will run for half the time you‚Äôre camping).¬†

Here are some [tips on conserving propane in your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/at-the-campsite/3-tips-for-conserving-propane/).

***Technician Tip:*** *Remember there are other propane appliances in your RV. The calculations above represent only the available operating hours for your RV furnace, but they can be used if you know the BTU ratings of your RV‚Äôs other appliances, such as your water heater, refrigerator, stove, oven, and outdoor grill.*¬†

# How to Clean an RV Furnace

Pet hair can be a problem for certain RV furnaces. For starters, [cleaning and disinfecting your RV after every trip](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/ask-an-expert-cleaning-and-disinfecting-your-rv-after-a-trip/) keeps it in the best shape possible, and it‚Äôll help your RV furnace run more efficiently.¬†

Inside your RV, use an RV vacuum to keep dust and dander to a minimum. You can remove the return air vent to vacuum dust and pet hair around your furnace unit on some floorplans. Just turn the furnace off before doing so.¬†

Outside your RV, use a portable air compressor to remove dust, debris, pet hair, and insect nests from your furnace‚Äôs exhaust tube. This is a good thing to add to your seasonal maintenance list when [winterizing your RV](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/how-to-winterize-your-rv/) in the fall and [dewinterizing it to prep for spring camping](https://blog.campingworld.com/rv-basics/tips-for-taking-your-rv-out-of-winter-storage/).¬†¬†

***Technician Tip:*** *Please note that forced air furnaces (not hydronic heating systems) are designed to operate without filters. If you were to acquire and find a way to install a filter on your forced air furnace, it would void any existing warranties and create a potentially dangerous situation.*

# RV Furnace Troubleshooting Tips

Troubleshooting your RV furnace can be complex, but we have a few downloadable resources to help. You can also [schedule a service appointment](https://rv.campingworld.com/service) at your local Camping World Service Center for a professional furnace inspection.¬†

Here‚Äôs a decision tree for troubleshooting RV furnaces.¬†

And here‚Äôs another specifically for thermostat-related issues.¬†

Beyond that, you can do some basic troubleshooting with the right tools.¬†

# Measuring Line Voltage Using a Digital Multimeter

1. Measure incoming voltage at the wire connections on the side of the furnace. The nominal voltage should be 10.5 to 13.5 volts DC under an ***unloaded*** condition. If less than 10.5 VDC, the blower motor won‚Äôt spin fast enough to activate the sail switch.
2. Turn the furnace on and verify the ignition.¬†
3. Measure the voltage at the wire connections on the side of the furnace. The nominal voltage should be 10.5 to 13.5 volts DC under a ***loaded*** condition.¬†

If measurements found are outside the acceptable range, you may have an issue with your RV‚Äôs DC power supply (i.e., your battery). Consult your service manual for further furnace diagnostic tips.¬†

# Evaluating Proper Airflow

1. Open all discharge registers and any closeable registers inside your RV and verify air discharge by feel (or using an air speed indicator).¬†
2. Ensure that airflow isn‚Äôt hindered by throw rugs or other floor coverings. Hindering your furnace‚Äôs airflow can cause the limit switch to open.¬†
3. Verify that the discharge is warm and check that no carbon monoxide is present using a carbon monoxide test.¬†
4. Check the opening size for the furnace‚Äôs return airflow, ensuring it matches your unit‚Äôs operating manual specifications.¬†

Other tests are required to verify the proper operation of your RV‚Äôs propane system ‚Äì not to mention the added complexity of hydronic heating systems. If and when you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed and stuck, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [contact your local Camping World Service Center](https://rv.campingworld.com/locations).¬†

But moves on to way that he don‚Äôt know where he'd put it and just ends the sentence in a question mark (in one of his backpacks maybe?). I'm starting to feel like I'm dragging a person that really doesn't want to be dragged and the whole idea doesn‚Äôt feel that fun anymore. 

Since I didn‚Äôt get a clear answer as to wether he would bring coffee I ask him if he could buy us some in case he wouldn‚Äôt be able to bring it. He just says I might as well buy it for us. At this point the whole attitude started getting on my nerves. I just replied that he can tell me when he's on his way. 

Since I didn't know if he would bring coffee on his own and frankly since my suggestion of buying coffee seemed like a problem to him, I informed him I had bought the coffee for myself. This made him so angry that he me I'm such a selfish person, that my communication skills are horrible and that I should have asked him if he wanted me to buy him some to be sure.

i tell them i can‚Äôt eat garlic because it makes me feel sick‚Ä¶ anything with garlic makes me sick (sucks bc i love garlic) and my parents say i‚Äôm overreacting, i‚Äôm being dramatic, i‚Äôm being a brat, they say ‚Äúyou must have parasites or something‚Äù, they tell me ‚Äúwell how come you never complained about it when you were younger?‚Äù as if aging isn‚Äôt a fucking thing ???? if my mom makes food she always uses garlic and tells me she didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ because they think i‚Äôm‚Ä¶ lying, i guess? what fucking reason would i have to lie about garlic making me sick? plus this is a very common thing‚Ä¶ food intolerances are a fucking thing. 

they also don‚Äôt take my job (which i‚Äôve been doing for 9 years and got a degree on‚Ä¶) seriously. they constantly make fun of how little i get paid (as if i loveeee being underpaid! plus i live in a third world country where basically every job is underpaid‚Ä¶) and if they‚Äôre driving me to work they don‚Äôt give a fuck about getting me there late‚Ä¶ they act as if i don‚Äôt have any obligations or responsibilities at my job ???? 

i got them to watch wicked at home with me, and during the first 10 mins all they did was say stuff like ‚Äúshe‚Äôs black‚Äù ‚Äúso what‚Äôs the moral of the story???‚Äù ‚Äúthis movie must be about racism because i haven‚Äôt learned anything from it‚Äù (yes, 10 mins into a 2,30 hour movie) they would fall asleep during the movie, talk over the songs (about stuff not related to the movie), not pay attention in general‚Ä¶ at the end, my mom said ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt like it because i like movies with happy endings‚Äù ?????? 

a couple days later i explained the movie to them, snd their reaction was ‚Äúso what are you supposed to do with knowing all that?‚Äù as in, what a waste of time for me to watch, enjoy and fucking pay attention to a movie????? something they do on a DAILY basis????? or i guess paying attention to the movie they put on isn‚Äôt really a thing they do?

then i talked about broadway, i showed them that one clip of Cynthia E. singing ‚Äúi am here‚Äù and they said ‚Äúso she‚Äôs singing in the theatre with no mic?‚Äù and i said ‚Äúthey are mic‚Äôd up, but the mics are on their wigs/forehead‚Äù and showed them the mic on cynthia‚Äôs forehead and they started laughing and saying ‚Äúyeah right, that‚Äôs a mic‚Äù ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs a technology we didn‚Äôt know existed‚Äù as if i‚Äôm just too naive to believe that‚Äôs a mic‚Ä¶ i said ‚Äúthey‚Äôve done this for ages‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs broadway, why don‚Äôt you learn a little bit about culture?‚Äù and they kept laughing and said ‚Äúokay well that‚Äôs enough you shouldn‚Äôt be so obsessed over anything‚Äù i literally talked about broadway for maybe 3 mins? and showed them like 2 10 sec clips??? 

i don‚Äôt understand why they must be so condescending toward me and act like i‚Äôm a child learning how to socialize and just saying random dinosaur facts at the most inappropriate times. i‚Äôm just trying to share with them‚Ä¶ they themselves have asked me to open up to them, i‚Äôm trying to do it, and this is their response. it just makes me want to be at home as little as possible‚Ä¶ i honestly can‚Äôt even make coffee without my mom saying something passive aggressive. i wake up, go to the kitchen and my mom immediately is complaining to me about something random about me‚Ä¶ could me my outfit, my makeup, my hair, my shoes, my weight, my breakfast, my choice of foods (consuming less red meat compared to them, no garlic) i‚Äôm not even talking about me not having a healthy diet‚Ä¶ we all eat the same things, except i don‚Äôt like beef that much so i don‚Äôt have it twice a day every single day like they do (it also hurts my gums‚Ä¶) 

if they complain about me waking up too late, then i wake up early the next day, but when they see me awake early they say stuff like ‚Äúso you didn‚Äôt sleep at all‚Äù ‚ÄúWOW what a miracle! HOW did you do that???‚Äù ‚ÄúWHY are you awake this early!‚Äù and i PROMISE they‚Äôre not trying to be funny and casual like americans are. they‚Äôre just being rude‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt use a tone of ‚Äúhaha you‚Äôre so silly!‚Äù it‚Äôs a tone of ‚Äúdamn you really are stupid‚Äù 

i‚Äôm honestly so tired of it all. i try to speak to them as little as possible to avoid having these kind of interactions but it‚Äôs impossible to avoid because they always have something negative to say about me. it‚Äôs fucking exhausting and if i try to talk to someone about it they always say ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs how parents are!‚Äù like okay that might be true but that comment isn‚Äôt helpful or nice. moving out isn‚Äôt an option for a while.

1hvt7f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1hvt7f6/should_i_get_a_formal_adhd_evaluation/,Should I get a formal adhd evaluation?,"Hi! I have felt like I possibly have some kind of inattentive adhd for many years but have never been formally evaluated. Now that I am an adult and can see my shortcomings more clearly, I have been considering asking for an evaluation. I wanted to ask you all if you think that would be a good idea based on my experience/symptoms below. I am not asking for a Reddit diagnosis, rather just some input on whether or not I am overthinking my experience or if I really should get evaluated. 

Here is what I have been feeling for many years:
- Disorganized: the funny thing is, I hate clutter/messes but I seem to be incapable of keeping spaces clean and organized for long. I can make spaces appear clean but usually this means sticking things in random cabinets and closets lol. I‚Äôm also one of those people that has a million unread notifications on my phone because I can‚Äôt seem to keep up with them and I put off responding‚Ä¶which leads me to my next point‚Ä¶
- Procrastination: sometimes I put things off and I don‚Äôt even know why? For example, there is a to-go coffee cup sitting on my kitchen table that I need to toss. Every time I see it, I tell myself ‚ÄúI need to throw that away‚Äù and then I just‚Ä¶don‚Äôt? I also will make myself busy with certain tasks to avoid/put off working on the bigger more daunting ones.
- Forgetful: my short term memory is CRAP. At work, if I‚Äôm asked to do something, I have to immediately write it down or else I‚Äôll forget. I also frequently tell myself ‚Äúoh I need to remember to bring XYZ to work today‚Äù and literally minutes later I forget. When I was in college, I had to write down EVERY due date/deadline in my planner or else I would definitely forget. Thankfully I never lost that planner‚Ä¶.that thing was my brain. 
- Scatter brained: I don‚Äôt even know how to explain this one. I can‚Äôt cook without making a mess unless I make a very intense conscious effort to prep things ahead of time and stay on track. I bounce from one task to the next, making some progress on each one but never finishing any of them. 
- Difficulty focusing/listening: this is another one of those things that I have to work really hard to do. Often times I find myself zoning out while someone is talking directly to me. I do it a lot with my husband. It makes me feel like such a horrible friend/wife. 
- Daydreaming: pretty self explanatory. 
- Issues with momentum: once I get started, I can usually keep myself going until I lose momentum and slow down. It‚Äôs the getting started part that‚Äôs hard for me. 
- 
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more but I‚Äôll leave it at that for now. Also, keep in mind, I am a fairly new mother and currently pregnant, which has exacerbated all of the above. But they have been present for a long time to varying degrees. 

As a child, I was very quiet, shy, well behaved, and extremely sensitive. I have become much more confident, vocal, and have developed tougher skin in my adulthood. However, I think I am still generally seen as a nice, even tempered, easy going but fairly sensitive person. 

In elementary school I have memories of bursting into tears in the middle of class because I couldn‚Äôt keep up as we read together and I kept losing track of where we were. But I also sometimes did really well to the point that I was the only student in my class that answered certain grammatical test questions correctly and was rewarded for it in front of the class. In middle school, I almost failed multiple history classes because I could NOT bring myself to study. For me, history class was just memorizing important dates, names, and events. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of problem solving or application, so it‚Äôs like my brain just could not retain or care about the info. 

I did MUCH better in college and even graduated magna cum laude, but I think that had to do with the fact that I was very interested in my major. I still struggled quite a bit with focus and studying but I got through it okay. 

From the outside, I think I probably appear ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or like I somewhat have my life together.

I think what is holding me back from getting evaluated is the fear that it will turn out that I don‚Äôt have adhd and I am in fact just a lazy, undisciplined person‚Ä¶ü•≤

It's embarrassing being 27 and having never gone anywhere by myself besides some doctor appointments and therapy when I was still going. 
I've finally been able to be okay with going to the gym by myself, it's a plus as our gym has an upstairs no one goes into so if my anxiety is too high I'll go up there. 
I've gathered a few more 'alone trip' ideas but have yet to act on them because I'm stuck on 'what if' scenarios. 
1. The theater. Seems easy enough right? The easiest thing I should be able to do? No, what if people think there's something wrong with me when they see I'm all alone at the movies? It's stupid, I know.
2. Cafe. Where I could also do some writing or read for awhile as I enough some food and a coffee. But what I they kick me out for how long I'm staying there? Because I'm ""loitering?"" Or even, just like the theater, why am I out to eat by myself like a loser?
3. Library. Same as the cafe, I'd like to go read a couple hours or work on my writing but what if they kick me out? What if they watch me the entire time for ""suspicious behavior"" because I'm not just getting a book and leaving? I always feel like I'm being watched and that I'm guilty of something although I have nothing to be guilty of.


I haven't even been able to go to a salon in a year for a haircut because my last encounter had me feeling so awkward I feel too anxious to go back to a salon. Another thing I keep planning in my head to do but haven't managed to make the call yet. 
I just wish there was a therapy where they could go out with you and wait for you somewhere while you do your own thing and then go back to them when you need them. 


And my absolute biggest what if with all of this is that I don't drive. I rely on a rideshare service. So what if I get to the place I want to be and I start panicking and wish to leave? Can't do that if I have to wait for a ride.
Ugh dealing with this and having CPTSD where I'm just terrified of getting hurt by someone is a nightmare and all I want for this year is to defeat all of this.

We ended up going for a coffee and wine, also she asked me to come to her house. We had sex and next day she asked me if I want something casual or serious. I wanted serious, she wanted casual. We still hanged out after this, she started acting more like we had something serious, and I asked her what she actually wanted from me. The thing is, she recently ended a long relationship of 5-6 years and she is not sure she wants to take things to the next level. What is confusing for me is that we texted daily even in this period with holidays and all that stuff (we are not from the same home city) and she was making a lot of plans for both of us, talking with her parents about me, even wanted to spend the new Years eve together. But I was feeling her like she isn't sure about all this stuff so I asked her and her mind didn't change, she still wanted to have something casual. She gave me motives like it's still early from her last breakup and she likes me but can't feel more than that. 



I ended up saying that I don't want to f\*\*k around and treat someone like I have something serious with them, but without actually being in a relationship, and that we should go on with our lives since we don't want the same thing.

I decided to get a TDS Refractometer so that I could see exactly the percentage of my extractions and the TDS levels. The device also comes with an app which will analyze your dose, yield, temperature, time, extraction %, and TDS % and tell you where the shot is on a chart on a basic scale of weak to strong and sour to bitter with the sweet spot in the middle. The pro scale shows you a chart of where you are and where you would be with changes in ratio, extraction %, and TDS %. After doing my test a few times I found my shot was right in the sweet spot‚Äî20 grams in 42 grams out in 25 seconds. TDS% = 9.86, Extraction % = 20.71.

Yeah, I know just pull my shot and drink it! All that crap was unnecessary! Ok, you may have a point, but it was fun to me and I shared it because maybe it might be fun for someone else to nerd out on their espresso like me!ü§£ü§£ü§£",3,1736261445.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1hvt1c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hvt1c5/step_mother_from_hell/,Step mother from hell,"My mother and father broke up when I was 3 years old. He got an apartment a couple of blocks away from my mother so it would be easier for them to take care of me.

During this time period, he met a woman. Because of his new relationship with this woman (she had a son), I didnt get to see my father for a whole year.

I remember the first time I met her, she seemed to be a nice person, but it all changed when my father moved in with her and her son in a different town.

First of all I don't remember everything that has happened over the years, but I can tell you that I hated to go to my dad every other weekend because of her. 

It felt like I was stepping on egg shells everytime I was there, I started to breath and move silent just to avoid an altercation with her. There is one memory that has really latched on to me, I was about 9-10 years old and had just came out of the shower - I like to sing during the shower-process so that's what I did. 
All of a sudden she called my name and said: 

""you can't sing, so stop singing."" And so I did. 

She always had something bad to say to me, no matter what I was doing. My father who is afraid to have arguments, didn't stand up for me once. 

I met my dad twice a month, so when I came there I was happy to be with him, but she of course took notice of that and started to tell me that I have to go outside and play, and he didnt argue with her. 

One time my father drove me home to my moms place. He then had a conversation with my her on the balcony, my mother got furious over something and didn't let me see him for a full year. She didnt tell me why she was furious until i was about 20 years old.

Apparently he told her that his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum, he had to choose between her and her son or me.

Anyways, she became a control-freak. My father also became a ""servant"" to her. She completly broke him down. 
He told me and my mother that every week he came home from work, he would find all his stuff packed in a luggage laying on the bed, as a threat.

When I became 18 I decided to stop visiting my father, I didnt see him for 10 years (They are still together). But last year i decided to meet him, and that shit was dreadful. 

He told me that I could come for a sleep-over, he also told me that his girlfriend was on vacation in Spain. 

First of all, he picked me up. We went to the store to buy snacks. He asked me if I could buy it all, which I had no problem with. In the parking lot he told me that he didnt want my step mother to see that he had bought snacks on his bank account. I got a bit anxious over the situation because it felt like I had traveled back in time. 

Anyways we came home to him and we had a blast, playing videogames all day long. Right before bedtime he asked me where i want to sleep, I told him that I could sleep in the guest room. 

He then told me that we had to take a picture of the bed before I layed in it. Turns out that my step mother didn't know I was there, so he had to take a photo. He would then use the photo as a guide in order to make the bed look the same after I left.

A heavy feeling appeared in my stomach and all the anxiety from when I was a child came back. I wanted to leave, but it was too late in the evening. 

The day after, we ate breakfast. He asked me if I could make some coffee, he then told me to be careful so i dont drop any coffee powder on the counter.

""She will notice it"" he said.

A couple of hours later I was about to leave, he told me to take all the leftover snacks with me. Apparently he couldn't throw it at their place, because she would find it...

I took all the snacks and left. 

I am glad that I finally met him but at the same time, I am angry/sad, I thought these 10 years would change something... but it just made me feel like an anxious kid again.",2,1736261354.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

The Breville BES870XL Barista Express espresso machine is a popular choice among home baristas, known for its impressive features and ability to produce cafe-quality espresso.  But the price tag can be daunting.  This is where a refurbished Breville BES870XL Barista Express comes in ‚Äì offering a premium espresso experience at a significantly lower cost. This article will explore the benefits of purchasing a refurbished model, its key features, and how it compares to other options on the market.


## Understanding the Breville BES870XL Barista Express

First launched to much fanfare, the Breville BES870XL Barista Express quickly established itself as a leader in the home espresso machine market. Its popularity stems from its impressive combination of features designed for ease of use and high-quality espresso production.  Key features include:

* **15-bar Italian Pump:** This pump ensures consistent pressure for optimal espresso extraction, resulting in rich crema and balanced flavor profiles.  This is a critical component for achieving that perfect espresso shot.
* **Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:**  Freshly ground beans are essential for superior espresso.  The integrated grinder eliminates the need for a separate grinder, simplifying the brewing process and ensuring optimal freshness.  The conical burrs provide consistent particle size for even extraction.
* **Thermocoil Heating System:**  This system efficiently heats the water, maintaining a stable temperature for consistent brewing.  This is vital for producing espresso with the right balance of flavor and body.
* **Stainless Steel Construction:**  The durable stainless steel construction ensures longevity and a premium look.


This machine consistently receives high praise from users, boasting a 4.8-star rating based on thousands of reviews.  These reviews frequently highlight its ease of use, even for beginners, and its ability to produce professional-quality espresso at home.


## What Does """"Refurbished"""" Mean?

When considering a refurbished espresso machine, it's important to understand what this entails.  A refurbished machine is a pre-owned unit that has been thoroughly inspected, cleaned, and repaired (if necessary) by a qualified technician. This process aims to restore the machine to its original working condition and often includes replacing worn-out parts.  This contrasts with a """"used"""" machine, which may have unseen issues or require immediate repairs.


## Advantages of a Refurbished Breville BES870XL

The primary advantage of purchasing a refurbished Breville BES870XL is the significant cost savings.  You can often find refurbished models for 30-50% less than the price of a new machine [2][5], making high-end espresso technology accessible to a wider audience.

Beyond the cost savings, reputable sellers of refurbished machines offer quality assurance.  They typically provide thorough inspections, repairs, and sometimes even warranties [5], mitigating the risks associated with buying used equipment.  This means you can enjoy the benefits of a premium machine with added peace of mind.


## Key Features of the Refurbished Breville BES870XL

The features of a refurbished Breville BES870XL are identical to those of a new model.  You still get:

* **Exceptional Espresso Performance:** The 15-bar pump and integrated grinder ensure consistent, high-quality espresso shots every time.
* **User-Friendly Design:** The intuitive interface and pre-programmed settings make it easy to use, even for beginners.  Mastering espresso techniques becomes less daunting.
* **Durable Construction:** The stainless steel construction ensures the machine will last for years to come with proper care.
* **Efficient Thermocoil Technology:**  Enjoy consistent water temperature for optimal espresso extraction.


## Customer Testimonials and Reviews

Online reviews consistently praise the Breville BES870XL for its ease of use, consistent espresso quality, and overall value.  Many users highlight the convenience of the integrated grinder and the quality of the espresso produced.  While minor issues, like occasional inconsistencies in grinding or minor leaks, are sometimes reported [1], these are often user-related and easily addressed with proper maintenance and cleaning.  Reputable refurbishers often address these common issues as part of the refurbishment process.


## Comparative Analysis: Refurbished Breville BES870XL vs. Other Options

The refurbished Breville BES870XL competes with other popular refurbished espresso machines, such as the Quick Mill Vetrano 2B Evo and Rocket Espresso Mozzafiato Cronometro R [5]. These machines often offer similar features, but the Breville BES870XL stands out for its user-friendly interface and integrated grinder, making it a more accessible option for home baristas.  While the other machines may offer more advanced features, the Breville provides a great balance of performance and ease of use at a more budget-friendly price point.


## Practical Tips for Using Your Refurbished Breville BES870XL

To maximize the lifespan and performance of your refurbished Breville BES870XL, follow these tips:

* **Regular Cleaning:**  Clean the machine regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.  This includes backflushing the group head and cleaning the grinder.
* **Proper Grinding and Tamping:**  Consistent grinding and tamping are crucial for optimal espresso extraction.  Experiment to find the ideal grind size and tamping pressure for your beans.
* **Water Quality:**  Use filtered water to prevent mineral buildup and maintain the machine's performance.


## Conclusion:  Premium Espresso Without the Premium Price

A refurbished Breville BES870XL Barista Express offers a compelling value proposition for coffee enthusiasts seeking a high-quality espresso machine without breaking the bank.  The significant cost savings, combined with the assurance of a thorough refurbishment process, make it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers who don't want to compromise on quality.  With its user-friendly design and ability to produce exceptional espresso, the refurbished Breville BES870XL is a fantastic investment for any home barista.

1hvsros,https://i.redd.it/z3arhir42lbe1.jpeg,"For those staying home, whatcha been up to?","Good morning on Day #4 of Snowmageddon. My husband and I are retired and thankful we don‚Äôt have to get out, although we are going a little stir crazy. 

The buildup and wait for this storm was a bit tortuous thanks largely to Bill Meck. He‚Äôs good at what he does but gets way too much airtime. We prepped accordingly and were ready to eat milk sandwiches if need be. 

Our dogs had different opinions about the actual storm. Our elderly demented dog Lucy, a collie retriever mix with a thick coat, would have happily laid out in the yard until the sleet started. We compromised by keeping a heater on across from her bed on the porch. Our little, Missy the Covid dog shih tzu, wanted nothing to do with it, especially when the snow was belly deep. She could no longer smell her usual spots and required an escort, and a dug out spot thanks to hubby, to take care of business. Yes, our dogs have it better than some people. 

I have the bake in emergencies gene and had to resist doing so as we had plenty of sweets after Christmas. 

The first day I deep cleaned the kitchen (fun), made good use if our leftovers (hopping john and a roast turkey breast and sides), finishing up the apple pie I made for New Years. We binge watched Harlan Coben‚Äôs latest English detective series while I finished knitting a scarf and fingerless glove set. We checked in with family in Texas, WV, and western Kentucky sharing pics of the outdoor transformation. 

Yesterday, we awoke to an ice planet. The limbs on our little dogwood in the front yard were bent to the ground under the weight of the ice. Some of our neighbors lost limbs on their trees. A few intrepid souls who probably had no choice but to work left tracks in the packed snow and ice on our street. Missy figured out she could walk on top of the frozen snow and made investigatory ventures outside. Lucy spent more time than usual indoors (she loves her porch time). I made omelets for breakfast, soup and sandwiches for lunch, and lasagna for dinner. I was proud of myself that I had all the ingredients on hand even though I hadn‚Äôt planned on making it. 

Since I was done with my knitting project, I pulled out some cast off prints from classmates at my printmaking class at UK and began making horses from them. I followed the directions the first time then took my own path. I will put a link to the pattern in the comments for those of you who want to try it. I‚Äôm happy with the direction it‚Äôs going. 

Hubby chipped ice off the car that doesn‚Äôt live in the garage and read a book on his Kindle. Last night we watched a strange but good movie, Nightbitch with Amy Adams. The title gives nothing away, and I won‚Äôt either except to say it‚Äôs deep and explores motherhood and life choices. As an artist, I related to the way Mother sees the world. 

This morning looks a lot like yesterday. I allowed myself to sleep in until 8:30. Hubby got his own breakfast and is braving the cold and neighborhood streets for a walk in the mall. I‚Äôm enjoying my coffee and writing this. A little later, I‚Äôll share some lasagna over the fence with our back door neighbor for their supper. They‚Äôre a young family with two elementary school aged boys that have stolen our hearts. I have no plan for the rest of my day but suspect more horses will be made, maybe by some of you. 

We are thankful we haven‚Äôt lost power (thank you underground utilities). While we are on emergency heat since our heat pump is covered in ice, we are warm enough and have all we need. We hope you have weathered the storm well. I look forward to reading your stories. ",4,1736260581.0,lexington,3,0.83,False
1hvsr9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hvsr9z/stepmother_from_hell/,Step-mother from hell,"My mother and father broke up when I was 3 years old. He got an apartment a couple of blocks away from my mother so it would be easier for them to take care of me.

During this time period, he met a woman. Because of his new relationship with this woman (she had a son), I didnt get to see my father for a whole year.

I remember the first time I met her, she seemed to be a nice person, but it all changed when my father moved in with her and her son in a different town.

First of all I don't remember everything that has happened over the years, but I can tell you that I hated to go to my dad every other weekend because of her. 

It felt like I was stepping on egg shells everytime I was there, I started to breath and move silent just to avoid an altercation with her. There is one memory that has really latched on to me, I was about 9-10 years old and had just came out of the shower - I like to sing during the shower-process so that's what I did. 
All of a sudden she called my name and said: 

""you can't sing, so stop singing."" And so I did. 

She always had something bad to say to me, no matter what I was doing. My father who is afraid to have arguments, didn't stand up for me once. 

I met my dad twice a month, so when I came there I was happy to be with him, but she of course took notice of that and started to tell me that I have to go outside and play, and he didnt argue with her. 

One time my father drove me home to my moms place. He then had a conversation with my her on the balcony, my mother got furious over something and didn't let me see him for a full year. She didnt tell me why she was furious until i was about 20 years old.

Apparently he told her that his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum, he had to choose between her and her son or me.

Anyways, she became a control-freak. My father also became a ""servant"" to her. She completly broke him down. 
He told me and my mother that every week he came home from work, he would find all his stuff packed in a luggage laying on the bed, as a threat.

When I became 18 I decided to stop visiting my father, I didnt see him for 10 years (They are still together). But last year i decided to meet him, and that shit was dreadful. 

He told me that I could come for a sleep-over, he also told me that his girlfriend was on vacation in Spain. 

First of all, he picked me up. We went to the store to buy snacks. He asked me if I could buy it all, which I had no problem with. In the parking lot he told me that he didnt want my step mother to see that he had bought snacks on his bank account. I got a bit anxious over the situation because it felt like I had traveled back in time. 

Anyways we came home to him and we had a blast, playing videogames all day long. Right before bedtime he asked me where i want to sleep, I told him that I could sleep in the guest room. 

He then told me that we had to take a picture of the bed before I layed in it. Turns out that my step mother didn't know I was there, so he had to take a photo. He would then use the photo as a guide in order to make the bed look the same after I left.

A heavy feeling appeared in my stomach and all the anxiety from when I was a child came back. I wanted to leave, but it was too late in the evening. 

The day after, we ate breakfast. He asked me if I could make some coffee, he then told me to be careful so i dont drop any coffee powder on the counter.

""She will notice it"" he said.

A couple of hours later I was about to leave, he told me to take all the leftover snacks with me. Apparently he couldn't throw it at their place, because she would find it...

I took all the snacks and left. 

I am glad that I finally met him but at the same time, I am angry/sad, I thought these 10 years would change something... but it just made me feel like an anxious kid again.",1,1736260547.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hvsr6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wellbutrin_Bupropion/comments/1hvsr6i/this_medication_is_the_best/,This medication is the BEST,"When I first got prescribed wellbutrin a few months ago, I found this subreddit and read a lot of ""bad reviews"" of this medication. All experiences shared here are valid and real, but it made me nervous and anxious to see how I'd feel in a month or two months when it really started to work. I was at a breaking point in my life though and trusted my doctor. I'm adding my experience here so those that were in a similar spot to me a few months ago can have another data point for the ""this truly helped me"" bucket.

  
I'd never been on medication before, but had been to talk therapy. I found myself suffering from what I thought was a really bad case of the SAD. Went to my doctor, not even feeling enough to be embarrassed or shameful about asking for help. My doctor listened and offered Wellbutrin 150 extended release as an option. I got it filled and started taking it the next morning. She also ordered some blood tests.

The immediate side effects I noticed is that I completely cut caffeine out of my life because I was so awake after taking this medication I was scared to find out what the caffeine from coffee/tea/soda would do to me. I became slightly more focused in what I was doing to the point where I would forget to eat meals unless I actively said to myself ""huh, it's lunch time, guess I should eat"". 

At my four week check in with my doctor, that was all I had to report. I wasn't necessarily less depressed than I was before, but was interacting with the world differently. Blood tests came back and showed I was single digits of Vitamin D. I got prescribed mega doses of Vitamin D, and chose to try another month of Wellbutrin.

Around five and a half weeks, I started drinking coffee again because the initial ""awake-ness"" had worn off. I became slightly less hyper focused. I was essentially returning to my ""normal"" BUT I became less depressed. I noticed this one day when I was sitting on my couch with my cat and thought to myself ""I have everything I could want or need right now, I am happy with my life how it is"". After thinking that, I thought it was such a weird thought. The next day I found myself thinking how grateful I was for this nice little life I was building for myself. 

Each day after that has gotten even better. I'm two and a half months in on this medication and it was honestly one of the best steps I've taken in my life. That plus correcting my Vitamin D - I think the medications are working in tandem. I had another checkin with my doctor and I literally told her ""I've never felt this content with my life. I feel happy. Is this how other people feel all the time? I've never experienced this before."". 

If you're starting your journey on this medication and scared because of some of the experiences posted here, my best advice is, tune it out. Trust yourself and your doctor, pay attention to how you're feeling. In my journal, I made a point to have the first thing say how I was feeling. Some examples are: ""Day 1: still depressed but very awake"" and ""Day 35: Back to normal, I guess. Social interactions feel easier"" and ""Day 66: I am so grateful for my life"". Everyone is going to have a different experience. Yours might be bad, and you might find relief on something else. BUT. Your experience might be GREAT. And in two months you might be thanking yourself for taking the leap. ",5,1736260540.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,1,0.86,False

Was in Tesco Costa with my mum after taking her to chair exercise for the first time. Popped in for a coffee and a chat. First the card reader wouldn't accept my bank card - that's a whole thing too - so I had to gwt my mum's card, then that didn't work and had to call the partially deaf woman over. It's was 12ish so it was busy. Then the woman at the table next to us practically bathed in the most perfumed hand sanitizer I have ever smelled. The woman on the table to the other side of us kept turn to us to cough so she didn't cough on her friends. (She did cover her mouth, but still...)

We finally left the cafe to do my mum's shopping and it seemed that every aisle had someone who had received perfume or aftershave for Xmas and decided to bathe in it. By the time we get to the checkout I'm flapping my fiddle (a set of connected metal loops that can be spun or flapped). By the time we get out I'm flapping it in my ear and blinking hard, eyes looking everywhere. 

I had my invisible disability lanyard on and the lady on the checkout, now I have calmed down I recognise was really good as I was not with it. Went through everything with my clubcard and packing and paying (my bankcard played up again but she sorted it). So calm and nice.

My mum still is a bit weird about my diagnosis, she accepts it's but will still get a bit embarrassed when I stim or get agitated. But before my diagnosis when I was 'masking' I would get super angry and annoyed, but she dealt with that... Then her and the cab driver (her regular driver) were gently taking the piss a bit. Knowing them, it was because it's how they cope with awkward and I don't really mind tbh.  But when I got in and hubby tried it I yelled at him, but by that point I was close to a meltdown. Poor bloke.

We met on bumble and I have met him in real life twice. He seems nice, we appear to have the same values and opinions on life. We grew up in the same town with similar upbringings which I think helps. A few problems are:

Upon first meeting (we went on a walk with my dog) he was quite cuddly, he had been saying he had been super excited to meet me (being a single mum as you all know it's hard to find time for dating). But kept grabbing my hand, putting his arm round me like we'd known each other months. I told him I wasn't used to as much affection so it felt weird for me. That didn't stop him from trying to kiss me on the forehead at the end of the date. 

After this I told him he was coming on a bit strong, but I also said I couldn't deny we have a lot in common, conversation was flowing etc so I didn't necessarily want to call it off (maybe I should have?) but could we just slow down? He apologised and said he felt a bit like a golden retriever around me and was struggling to not smother me because he was just so excited to have finally found what he feels like is a connection. 

Second meeting was a lot better, we met at a coffee shop and just had a chat, apart from him staring at me as if I was some kind of goddess, all went okay. 

I'm not attracted to him. He's not bad looking, but I just don't think he's attractive. I feel like this mixed with him coming on so strong has made me pull back and ""get the ick"" as they say (I'm new to the dating game. I married the first boyfriend I had which was at 17  and we were together 13 years). Or maybe im just not ready? I have asked friends their opinion and I'm getting mixed opinions from ""would it be so bad to be with someone who likes you more than you like them for once?"" to ""oh no that's too much!"" 

I've told him I'm not sure what I want at the moment, and I don't expect him to wait around and he doesn't owe me anything etc because I'm really not sure where my head is at.

Morning ritual includes tea or coffee culturally, its hard to break from the delicious coffee.

I got in the habit of drinking plain milk tea every day (the ones from Boba shops) and had no idea they have the same amount of caffiene as a small or even a large coffee because they use more tea than average cup at home T.T I'm on a great medication but lately have had a spike in anxiety and intrusive thoughts. NOW I KNOW WHY IT GOT WORSE oh my lord I feel so stupid because DUH

A special two in one coverage post.

Yesterday the Planning Commission met, and passed approval for a ten unit Habitat for Humanity of Elkhart County expansion in Elkhart.  These will bring much needed affordable housing to our community.


A rezone request received a do-pass recommendation to convert the Budget Motel on Cassopolis St into a 7 Brew Drive through coffee.  This will go to the City Council for a full vote.


******
In the first Elkhart City Council meeting of 2025. Officers were elected:


1. Arvis Dawson will continue to serve as Council President.
2. Dwight Fish will continue to serve as Council Vice President.


We received an update on the Tolson Center, and heard more about their upcoming fundraiser, and plans for outdoor expansion. That includes a soccer field, basketball court, pickleball and more.


We also got to check out the award the Tolson Center received for program innovation.  I'm looking forward to seeing the Tolson Center continue to grow and thrive.


The three ordinances on the first read were all related to matching funds for infrastructure projects.


What's a matching fund? Essentially the city puts up half the money, and a grant is the other half. For ordinances 25-O-01 and 25-O-02 the city is receiving $352,672.50 from the State, and will match that, for a total of $777,672.50.


The  paving projects for these two ordinances will include: 
x Bristol from Cassopolis to Osolo;

x Lear Court and Lear Drive;

x Park Six Court and Park Six Drive.


The third is another infrastructure ordinance. 24-0-03 will have the city  pledging $6,017,045.42 to match a federal(mandated by the state )$6,672,000.00.  This will be for the Bristol Street widening project.


These were passed onto the second and third readings for a final vote, and public comment. Due to the time needed for a public notice, there isn't enough time (10 days required) between meetings this month.


So these ordinances will be heard and have final read Feb 3rd",3,1736259059.0,Elkhart,0,1.0,False

I guess there's some background to this. My first IT job was part-time and at a small private university. I was a level 2 tech, so I really just went around and helped out with people's computers and I also did a lot of event setup for zooms and conferences. I didn't really do any work with AD or any 365 administration or anything, it was really just barebones, ADManager and on-site support. The manager and I weren't like best friends or anything, but we had a good rapport and I felt valued in that role. I also enjoyed how easy going everyone was.

  
After about a year of doing the same thing over and over again (fixing projectors, helping professors log in to their computers, etc.), I decided that I wanted to move up in the world. I applied to a job that had a lot of the responsibilities of a sysadmin and I got it. Now I know AD like the back of my hand, I work with exchange administration, Intune, Citrix, and am starting to do some work with RHEL. I think that this experience has been valuable, but there's one major issue with this new company: it is international, and my manager works in an office that is on the other side of the country. There is no rapport with any of my coworkers or even the people who work in my building. 



My old job involved a lot of movement as I was called out to help different professors/staff, where this job involves sitting at a desk all day and only getting up to get coffee or go to the bathroom - there is no business necessity for me to get up and move around.

  
I wish there were a way for me to go back to that old job but maintain the same job responsibilities that I have now, as well as a full-time schedule. I think I enjoyed the environment there more, but I enjoy the workload here. I'm thinking about maybe reapplying to my old job. What would you do in this situation?

  
tl;dr: I miss the environment of my old job but enjoy the workload of my new job. I'm thinking about trying to negotiate my way back into my old role with some more responsibilities than I had before. What would you do?",7,1736259036.0,ITCareerQuestions,5,0.89,False

I had a thing with him following 3k people and most of them were girls from our city that he‚Äôs seen or met at the club / coffee shop / university. And it really bothered me a while back, so I talked to him about it. After months of arguing and talking to him about how it felt for me, his following went from 3k to 1k.

I was just super uncomfortable with the girls I know he finds attractive especially those he just met at the club or somewhere then he instinctively stalked their socials or sumn. So I put emphasis on those girls. 

His ex girlfriends or ex fubus weren‚Äôt really a big deal to me cause I too was following my ex bf and the previous guys I hooked up with. 

One time, an ex fubu hit me up and he told me to block him even tho I explained to my ex fubu that I was already in a relationship and kindly declined his offer. I showed my bf everything, the screenshots, and stuff to reassure him. He told me ‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd blocked him, why did you unblock him‚Äù 

1. I didn‚Äôt block him. I don‚Äôt block exes and ex fubus unless it ended really badly. 
2. I couldn‚Äôt possibly have cause if I did then I wouldn‚Äôt have shown him the chat. 

He kept insisting that I told him I did and then that i just unblocked him‚Ä¶ he was insisting that I block him. And I called him off on that, since he was even still following the FINSTAS / DUMP accounts of the women he had sex with and the finstas and dumps of his failed talking stages. For what reason?

It only bothered me slightly before but months after, he told me to unfollow my ex fubu on Instagram. All while he‚Äôs still following women‚Äôs finstas. 

I‚Äôm feeling pissed off but I‚Äôm trying to be nice and ‚Äúnot bring back the past‚Äù or ‚Äúnot bring up anything else‚Äù cause he would feel like I‚Äôm invalidating him. 

I unfollowed my ex fubus. And he‚Äôs questioning why I followed one local celebrity guy all while he‚Äôs following still a bunch of celebrity girls (I have no issue with that its just don‚Äôt get mad at me for something you‚Äôre doing?) + random girls still who doesn‚Äôt even follow him back.

We met on Bumble in 2017. She‚Äôs the kind of person who lights up a room - funny, sharp, and effortlessly cool. I (Alex, 31M - Bi) fell hard for her when we met. One of the things I‚Äôve always admired about Evie is her honesty. Early in our relationship, she told me she was bisexual. I was the first person she confided in, and I helped her through the coming-out process, even sitting beside her when she told her parents. Thankfully, they took it well, and since then, Evie‚Äôs been living her truth.

Her openness never bothered me; if anything, it strengthened our bond. We became each other‚Äôs safe space, our relationship built on mutual trust and vulnerability. Evie was my best friend.

Over the years, we‚Äôd joke about her attraction to women. Sometimes we‚Äôd sit in coffee shops, people-watching, and whispering when a cute woman walked by. We even fantasized about a threesome in a light-hearted way, but it was always just that, a fantasy. Our marriage felt solid. Sure, we had the usual ups and downs, but nothing that ever shook my confidence in our relationship.

Then, in **mid-2023**, Keira (29F - looks quite masc, queer) entered the picture.

Keira started working with Evie at her office. At first, she seemed like a typical new co-worker, friendly, confident, and eager to fit in. But it didn‚Äôt take long for her to become a fixture in Evie‚Äôs life. They started spending more time together, hanging out after work, texting constantly, and meeting for drinks. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first. I trusted Evie completely, and honestly, I was happy she was building a social life again after we moved in 2022. Her social circle had shrunk, and I knew it had been tough for her.

It wasn‚Äôt until Keira came over to our apartment one evening in **October 2023** that I noticed the shift.

That night, we were all having drinks. This was my first time properly meeting Keira, as most of what I knew about her came from Evie‚Äôs stories. The conversation flowed easily, but as the alcohol loosened us up, the vibe started to change. The topic of threesomes came up, and feeling bold (and stupid), I casually mentioned that Evie was bi and joked that we‚Äôd be open to it with the right person. Keira‚Äôs eyes lit up. She leaned in, asking Evie playful, pointed questions about her experiences and preferences.

**A few days later**, I got a text from Keira asking if I‚Äôd been serious about the threesome. My judgment took a backseat to my hormones, and I said yes. She told me she felt nervous about being with a man for the first time and wanted to get comfortable with Evie first. That sounded reasonable, so I agreed, thinking it would all come together eventually. Big mistake.

The first red flag hit me like a truck when I came home one evening to find Evie and Keira on our couch, both completely naked. I was blindsided. They insisted this was part of Keira‚Äôs ‚Äúprocess,‚Äù and Evie accused me of rushing things when I expressed my discomfort.

To keep the peace, I reluctantly agreed to stay out of the way whenever Keira came over. But her visits became constant. She‚Äôd show up unannounced, and I began to feel like a third wheel in my own home. Anytime I brought up the supposed threesome, Evie would snap, accusing me of being impatient.

The breaking point came when Evie told me to leave the apartment one evening in the **Spring of 2024** because Keira was coming over, and they had ‚Äúplans.‚Äù I refused. Evie accused me of being controlling and said I was invading her personal space. She even threatened to leave if I didn‚Äôt go.

**After that fight:**

I tried to talk things out with Evie, but she was defensive, almost like she couldn‚Äôt see things from my perspective anymore. She kept insisting that I didn‚Äôt understand how lonely she felt when I was away for work. Being in the film industry, I travel a lot for shoots (across the UK in hotels or, sometimes, if I‚Äôm lucky, getting a gig abroad), sometimes for weeks or months at a time, and I know that can take a toll on any relationship.

That night, Evie broke down in front of me. She started crying uncontrollably, her tears falling so fast I didn‚Äôt know how to comfort her at first, and her voice trembled as she spoke, barely able to hold it together. She said something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blaming you, Alex,‚Äù while she was wiping her eyes. She always supported my dreams like I did for her, but she‚Äôd never opened up about her worries until now. It's a tricky industry not just a normal 9-5 job.

Evie explained how when I was gone, she felt a deep, aching loneliness. Yes, she had a job, and we had pets, but things weren‚Äôt the same. We‚Äôd moved in 2022, and her social life hadn‚Äôt picked up. She mentioned how we were trying to have a child, but it wasn‚Äôt going the way we hoped, and it left her feeling isolated. Then she explained - Keira‚Äôs been there for her in a way she didn‚Äôt realize she needed. Then saying she's so sorry she's been spending so much time with her. It‚Äôs just, that Keira makes her feel like she's not alone.

She apologized for how that had affected us, how the time with Keira had come between us, but also for not communicating her loneliness before. She said Keira had helped her with her mental health and made her feel seen in a way she didn‚Äôt expect. It was a soft spot in my heart hearing her say it, even though it stung. Evie continued with something like, ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs been too much, but I don‚Äôt want to lose you. I still love you. I want us to be okay and I will cut her out of my life to make you happy"".

After a long silence, I pulled her into a tight hug, holding her until her sobs subsided. I never meant to make her feel isolated. But I realized that if I truly loved Evie, I had to respect her space and her feelings, even if they involved Keira. It wasn‚Äôt what I envisioned for us, but I had to give her the room to figure things out.

It was an uneasy peace. But we agreed to try, to see where things went, and to keep the lines of communication open. I didn‚Äôt know where this was leading, but I promised myself that I would give her the time she needed to explore her feelings for Keira and me.

**Cut to Summer 2024:**

At first, it was small things. Keira would come over after work, casually join us for dinner, and hang out for hours. Sometimes, she‚Äôd bring wine, and the two of them would sit out in the garden, laughing and talking late into the night while I worked on emails or prepared for my next gig. On more than one occasion, I‚Äôd walk into the kitchen to find her cooking us breakfast. Keira put an effort into getting to know me and even offered to pay some expenses as she‚Äôd been here a lot.

I‚Äôd return from trips, exhausted from work, and Evie would often be out with Keira. I‚Äôd come home to an empty apartment or find them curled up together on the couch watching a film. But her stays became more frequent. I found Keira‚Äôs clothes mixed in with Evie‚Äôs in the laundry, her toothbrush in the bathroom, and even her favourite tea in our pantry.

**October 2024:**

Then one evening, Evie sat me down, her tone gentle but her words deliberate. She explained that Keira‚Äôs lease was ending soon and that she had nowhere else to go. The idea of Keira moving in felt like crossing a line that couldn‚Äôt be uncrossed, but Evie‚Äôs face was a mix of guilt and hope, her vulnerability tugging at my resolve. I'm such an idiot but Keira hasn't been horrible these past months ugh. She framed it as temporary. Evie reassured me it wouldn‚Äôt change anything between us, that our marriage would always come first.

**October 2024 to January 2025:**

Once Keira officially moved in, her bond with Evie seemed to deepen even further. On nights when I travelled, Keira didn‚Äôt just stay in the spare room. I knew, without having to ask, that she and Evie were sharing our bed.

By December, Keira had become fully entrenched in our lives. It was no surprise when Evie asked if she could spend Christmas with us, framing it as a kind gesture since Keira didn‚Äôt have family nearby. I agreed, wanting to keep the peace and make the holidays special for Evie. She seemed happier than I‚Äôd seen her in months.

Despite everything, Evie and I still had our moments. We went on dates, shared quiet evenings together, and kept trying to rekindle the connection that felt increasingly fragile. Then, in mid-December, we got news that should‚Äôve been the happiest moment of our lives: Evie was finally pregnant. After months of trying, it felt like a miracle, a chance to start fresh and rebuild what we‚Äôd lost.

For a while, it felt like we were finding our way back to each other, that maybe this new chapter could heal the fractures in our marriage. But Keira‚Äôs presence was always there, an unspoken tension that neither of us could fully ignore.

That evening, after dinner, Evie asked to talk. She seemed nervous, her hands trembling slightly as she took a seat beside me. Keira sat next to her, silent. Evie finally admitted what I had long suspected: in Evie‚Äôs words, her girlfriend. The part that hurt the most was when Evie admitted that she had fallen in love with Keira.

She broke down completely, sobbing as she begged me to understand. I held her as she cried, whispering that I just wanted her to be happy, even though my own heart was breaking. I told myself I could find a way to make it work, for her, for our baby.

In a strange turn of events, Evie suggested that we try to make this work, for the sake of our relationship and the baby on the way. She was willing to go slowly, to make sure I felt comfortable and heard in all of this. She even suggested that maybe we could revisit the idea of a threesome, but this time, it wouldn‚Äôt just be about the fantasy, it would be about exploring something real together.

After a long discussion, I decided to stand my ground. I was open to trying things, but only if it was on my terms. I needed time to process everything and set my boundaries, and I told Evie and Keira that I wasn't ready to fully embrace it yet. To my surprise, they both respected my decision. They understood that it was a lot to ask of me, and we agreed to take things slowly, on my terms.

As the months passed, things slowly shifted. Evie and I found new ways to connect, and I slowly began to open myself up to the idea of our relationship evolving. The three of us began to talk openly about our feelings and desires, and there was a lot of communication. While it wasn‚Äôt always easy, I could see the effort they both made to include me, to make sure I felt valued and heard.

Eventually, we gave it a shot. The threesome happened, but it was nothing like I‚Äôd imagined in those early, chaotic moments. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was real, and for the first time in a long time, I felt like I was finally part of something that made me happy, too, not just Evie.

I‚Äôm still figuring out what the future holds, but I‚Äôve realized something important along the way: I can‚Äôt control every part of our journey, but I can control how I approach it. For the first time in months, I feel like we‚Äôre moving forward, together. We‚Äôre building a future where everyone‚Äôs needs are respected and heard. And for now, that‚Äôs enough take it one day at a time, even as I wrestle with my emotions and the uncertainty of what comes next.",4,1736258317.0,relationship_advice,43,0.83,False
1hvryhs,https://i.redd.it/lkngy0h1vkbe1.jpeg,"Drugs, Beer & Beefsteaküíäüç∫ü•©","The 5 a.m. commute began like most. Coffee in the cupholder and my cellphone clipped to the dash, while I streamed CNBC across my car speakers.

Futures were bleeding.

I smiled while I sipped, but I wondered how I would pull off the plans I had for the day.

An hour later, I found my usual parking spot, which is one of the only free places to leave a vehicle in Nashville, but still about a mile from the power plant, so I popped my trunk and readied my foldable scooter for the odyssey ahead.

Empty coffee mug in the water-bottle holder. Heavy Carhartt jacket. Foam-lined, 5-panel trucker hat.

God, I looked ridiculous riding that fucking scooter in the dark. But still I buzzed myself across West End Avenue and past the campus fraternity houses while my ears turned to popsicles.

And once inside the powerhouse, I made more coffee and turned on CNBC, still waiting for my ears to thaw, not to mention the opening bell, which I knew would ding about the same time as the plant‚Äôs mandatory all-hands meeting.

The meeting began with all the usual mind-numbing pleasantries. And while I sipped on coffee, I crossed my legs and placed my iPhone on top of my knee.

‚Äú5,000 shares. Limit order. Buy.‚Äù

‚ÄúFilled,‚Äù the order status said.

Then two minutes later, ‚Äú5,000 shares. Limit order. Buy.‚Äù

The order filled about the same time I switched to my ROTH account and bought another 10,000 shares while I pretended to listen to the PowerPoint Presentation.

And two hours later, my phone was nearly dead, the third fill of my coffee mug was empty, and I had to take the piss of a lifetime. Still my shopping spree in the middle of a mini market meltdown wasn‚Äôt over.

I looked at the time.

Doctor‚Äôs appointment in 30 minutes‚Ä¶.

So I left the meeting, rode my scooter back to my car and charged my phone while I drove. And at each redlight, I did the same thing.

‚Äú5,000 shares. Limit order. Buy.‚Äù

Fifteen minutes later, I found the parking garage at the psychiatric outpatient client and made my way to the waiting area in the lobby.

‚Äú5,000 shares. Limit order. Buy.‚Äù

My phone had enough juice to put on a few more trades, but now my country ass was actually moving the technicals. Every stock on the market was flashing red, except for the stock I continued to buy. It wanted it to fall, and I let it occasionally, but the kind of volume my orders were creating actually had the stock blinking green.

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll wait,‚Äù I thought.

I had no idea how much stock I had purchased, nor did I care. All I knew was that I had a shit-ton more to spend.

The nurse took me back to an empty room. Took my blood pressure.

130 on the top number. A tick HIGH, then left. The resident doctor came in and we began to chat.

‚ÄúWell, on a positive note. I‚Äôm quite certain now that the medication is working, because I had the perfect circumstance to test it,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOh, really?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. See the other day, I made $2M dollars in about week, lost $1M in a single day, then ended up making it all back, and then some, when I sold it all for a $2.1M profit a few days later. But the whole time, I stayed level. Didn‚Äôt get emotional. Like I said, I think the medication is really working.‚Äù

The woman smiled. She seemed genuinely intrigued as we kept chatting about my bipolar symptoms and medication management. And once we had a plan, which was essentially to keep everything the way it was, she left and went to get a sign-off from her boss, who was evidentially in the next room.

The paper-thin walls made me smile. Because while I was sitting there, wearing a Purnell‚Äôs Country Sausage hat and donned in a Vanderbilt custodial/facilities uniform, I heard the woman tell the doctor, ‚ÄúI think this guy is a genius!‚Äù

Of, course. When both of them came back into the room to tie up the loose ends of my appointment, I let on like I was the biggest CountryDumb goober in the world. But once I had my drugs, I thought I‚Äôd treat myself to a beer and beefsteak.

So that‚Äôs what I did.

And after driving myself to the J. Alexander‚Äôs Steakhouse. I sat at the bar, eating a prime rib sandwich and drinking beer, while I tapped on my cellphone, entering Buy order after Buy order.

‚ÄúOh, shit. ACHR just dropped to $8.34,‚Äù I thought. ‚Äú15,000 shares. Limit. Buy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOrder filled,‚Äù the phone said.

‚ÄúNow, back to the task at hand‚Ä¶..‚Äù

No one at the bar had a clue what I was doing. Just as no one on Wall Street could figure out why the technicals on a particular stock were chopping sideways instead of plummeting like the rest of the stock exchange.

That‚Äôs because technicals don‚Äôt matter when there‚Äôs a certified lunatic in a Nashville bar with an iPhone, a 5G internet connection, and $2.1M to burn on a penny stock.

1hvry99,https://www.reddit.com/r/TinnitusCures/comments/1hvry99/how_i_beat_tinnitus_my_journey_with_ayurveda_and/,How I Beat Tinnitus: My Journey with Ayurveda and Panchakarma üåø,"If you‚Äôve ever struggled with tinnitus, you know how life-consuming it can be. For years, I was stuck in a living nightmare‚Äîthe constant ringing in my ears felt unbearable. It wasn‚Äôt just the noise; it was the anxiety, the sleepless nights, and the loss of hope that made it worse.

I‚Äôm a 27-year-old real estate investor, and I got tinnitus after a post-COVID immune system crash. A few nights of loud clubbing left me with hearing loss, and the tinnitus followed soon after. It wasn‚Äôt just a sound; it was the soundtrack of my life‚Äîa high-pitched tone that never stopped. It drove me crazy.

I tried everything: sound therapy, medications, supplements, lifestyle changes. Western doctors couldn‚Äôt offer much more than, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to live with it.‚Äù I was desperate. That‚Äôs when my sister stepped in and suggested something I‚Äôd never considered‚ÄîAyurveda.

Ayurveda is a 5,000-year-old healing science from India that focuses on balance‚Äîmind, body, and spirit. One of its most powerful treatments is Panchakarma, a detoxification process that removes toxins and restores harmony in the body. At first, I was skeptical. Western medicine didn‚Äôt really take Ayurveda seriously, and I wasn‚Äôt sure it could help. But honestly, I had nothing to lose.

So I took a leap of faith. The first step was visiting an Ayurvedic doctor at one of the retreats I chose. This is a crucial part of the process because Ayurveda doesn‚Äôt believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. Everything is tailored to you‚Äîyour body type (doshas), your symptoms, and your overall lifestyle.

I ended up going to three different retreats‚ÄîThe Raj in Iowa, Ananda in the Himalayas, and the Ayurveda Health Retreat in Florida. There are hundreds of amazing Ayurveda retreats worldwide, but these are the ones I personally went to and experienced life-changing benefits.

The Panchakarma process wasn‚Äôt easy. It involved herbal treatments, oil massages, steam baths, meditation, yoga, and a strict Ayurvedic diet. I had to give up alcohol, coffee, and processed foods‚Äîbasically all the things I used to enjoy but that made my tinnitus worse. At first, it felt like a sacrifice, but over time, I realized how much better my body felt.

And then the magic happened. By the end of my treatments, my tinnitus improved by 80-90%. The constant ringing that had controlled my life was now just a faint whisper, something I barely noticed. For the first time in years, I felt like I had control of my life again.

It wasn‚Äôt just my ears that healed. I felt more energized, my sleep improved, and my mind felt clearer. My skin even looked better. I could finally enjoy silence, meet friends without stressing about triggers, and embrace life fully again.

Let me be clear: I‚Äôm not a salesperson for Ayurveda or any retreat. I make $0 from sharing this. I‚Äôm just someone who knows what it‚Äôs like to feel hopeless and wants to help others who might be in the same boat. Ayurveda isn‚Äôt a quick fix, and it hasn‚Äôt been thoroughly researched or endorsed by Western medicine, but from my personal experience, it works.

If you‚Äôre struggling with tinnitus‚Äîor any chronic condition‚Äîplease consider exploring Ayurveda and Panchakarma. It‚Äôs about healing from the inside out, not just masking symptoms. Feel free to ask me any questions about my journey. Let‚Äôs support each other and find hope again. üåø‚ú®",1,1736258176.0,TinnitusCures,0,1.0,False

I started a new job a couple of months ago, working nights manufacturing/packaging for a big Pharma company. 
I (34m) am 5‚Äô9/200lbs, a volunteer FF, and have been doing manual labour my whole life so it‚Äôs all in my legs,arms, and shoulders. I‚Äôm also the only white guy beyond the supervisor (who is also new to the position and is pretty hands-off)and 4 other East Indian dudes, plus they brought on 3 temp workers who are also from India and are buddies with 3/4 of the permanent guys on my shift. 
I got along great with the other guys on shift with no issues previous to this incident, we‚Äôd talk and joke around and it was all good. We have an English speaking policy while on the floor but I would just pop in one of my headphones and tune out to an audiobook or Spotify when they got going in their first language because it‚Äôs 7:1 and as long as it isn‚Äôt work-specific I really don‚Äôt care, do your thing lol

Christmas Eve rolls around and it‚Äôs just business as usual, no issues. On our last break around 6am, one of temp guys is at the coffee machine and I‚Äôm just sitting at a table and the conversation goes like this;
Temp: ‚Äú*my name*?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù
Temp: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill you.‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?? Repeat that again.‚Äù
Temp: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù

Then Temp and his Permanent Buddy start to tell me that it‚Äôs okay and ‚Äúin our culture it‚Äôs just something we say to our friends, it‚Äôs not like that‚Äù to which I reply ‚Äú‚ÄòI‚Äôll kill you‚Äô is pretty universal.

Room goes quiet, the rest of our shift passes and I go home to try and enjoy Christmas.

I tell my supervisor at the start of our next shift as a courtesy heads up, and then we talk to the superintendent about it when she gets in. 
I straight up told her 
‚ÄúLook it‚Äôs your problem right now, you can make it a HR problem if you want to but if it happens again and becomes MY problem, it‚Äôs going to be EVERYBODY‚Äôs problem.‚Äù
She says ‚ÄúI understand, thank you for not starting a fistfight in the lunch room‚Äù, Contacts HR, HR terminates the Temp.

Since then, I have not had a word said to me by 5/6 of the rest of the guys on my shift. They‚Äôre blaming me for their buddy losing his job.

1hvroe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/High_endcoffeemaker/comments/1hvroe7/refurbished_breville_barista_express_espresso/,Refurbished Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine: Top Deals & Reviews,"[Fresh and Trendy ‚Äì Discover the Hottest New Products!](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=breville barista express espresso machine refurbished&s=date-desc-rank&tag=smartymode-20)

The Breville Barista Express is a popular choice among home baristas for its ease of use and ability to produce cafe-quality espresso.  However, its price tag can be prohibitive for some.  This is where refurbished Breville Barista Express espresso machines enter the picture, offering a compelling alternative for those seeking to save money without sacrificing quality. This article will delve into the world of refurbished Breville Barista Express machines, exploring the benefits, potential drawbacks, where to find the best deals, and what to look for before purchasing.

## Understanding Refurbished Breville Barista Express Machines

Before diving into the specifics, let's clarify what """"refurbished"""" means. A refurbished Breville Barista Express has been previously owned but has undergone a thorough inspection, cleaning, repair (if necessary), and testing process to ensure it meets Breville's quality standards.  This differs from simply """"used"""" machines, which haven't undergone this rigorous process.  Certified refurbished models, often sold directly through Breville or authorized retailers, typically come with a warranty, providing added peace of mind.

## The Advantages of Choosing a Refurbished Model

The primary advantage is undoubtedly the **cost savings**. Refurbished Breville Barista Express machines can often be found for $200-$300 less than their brand-new counterparts. This significant discount makes high-quality espresso accessible to a wider range of coffee enthusiasts.

Beyond the price, buying refurbished doesn't necessarily mean compromising on performance.  A properly refurbished machine should function just as well as a new one, delivering consistently rich and flavorful espresso shots. The key features of the Breville Barista Express ‚Äì the 15-bar pump pressure, integrated conical burr grinder, and automatic milk frother ‚Äì remain intact.  You still get the same excellent control over grind size, water temperature, and milk texture.

The robust **stainless steel construction** of the Breville Barista Express ensures durability, meaning your refurbished machine should last for years to come with proper care and maintenance.  This is a key factor to consider when weighing the cost savings against potential long-term reliability.


## Addressing Potential Concerns

While the advantages are clear, some potential buyers have legitimate concerns.  The most common is the **fear of reduced quality**.  This is valid if you purchase from an unreliable seller. However, buying a certified refurbished machine from a reputable source, such as eBay's certified refurbished program or authorized Breville retailers, significantly mitigates this risk. These sellers typically offer warranties and guarantee the machine's functionality.

Another concern might be the **complexity of repair and maintenance**.  However, the Breville Barista Express is generally considered user-friendly and relatively easy to maintain.  Regular cleaning and descaling are essential for optimal performance, regardless of whether the machine is new or refurbished.  Numerous online resources, including videos and forums, offer guidance on maintenance procedures.


## Where to Find the Best Deals on Refurbished Breville Barista Express Machines

Several reputable sources offer certified refurbished Breville Barista Express machines:

* **eBay:** eBay's Certified Refurbished program is a good place to start.  Look for sellers with high ratings and positive feedback. Pay close attention to the warranty offered and the seller's return policy.
* **Authorized Breville Retailers:** Check Breville's official website for authorized retailers that might offer certified refurbished models.  Buying directly from an authorized retailer offers additional protection and warranty support.
* **Amazon:** While Amazon doesn't have a dedicated """"certified refurbished"""" program for Breville in the same way as eBay, you can often find refurbished models sold by third-party sellers.  Thoroughly vet these sellers before purchasing.
* **Local Appliance Repair Shops:** Some local appliance repair shops may sell refurbished espresso machines. This route can sometimes offer great deals, but ensure you get a warranty and thorough inspection.


##  Comparing Refurbished vs. New: Is it Worth it?

The decision ultimately depends on your budget and priorities. A brand-new Breville Barista Express offers the peace of mind of knowing you're getting a completely untouched machine. However, the significant cost savings offered by a refurbished model are hard to ignore.  If you're on a budget, a certified refurbished Breville Barista Express is an excellent way to enjoy the same quality espresso without breaking the bank.  Consider the warranty offered and the reputation of the seller when making your decision.


##  Beyond the Price:  What to Look For When Buying Refurbished

When buying a refurbished Breville Barista Express, consider these factors:


* **Warranty:**  A warranty is crucial. Look for a minimum of a one-year warranty, preferably two years from a reputable seller.
* **Seller Reputation:** Check reviews and ratings before purchasing.  Look for sellers with a proven track record of selling quality refurbished goods.
* **Condition Description:**  Carefully read the seller's description of the machine's condition.  Look for details about any imperfections or previous repairs.
* **Shipping and Returns:**  Understand the shipping costs and the seller's return policy in case you're not satisfied with the machine.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:  How long do refurbished Breville Barista Express machines typically last?**  With proper care and maintenance, a refurbished Breville Barista Express can last for several years, just like a new machine.

**Q:  What if something goes wrong with my refurbished machine after the warranty expires?**  You can still find replacement parts online or through Breville's customer service.  Many repairs are relatively straightforward.

**Q:  Are all refurbished machines created equal?** No.  The quality of a refurbished machine greatly depends on the seller and the refurbishment process.  Stick to reputable sellers offering certified refurbished models with warranties.

**Q:  Can I return a refurbished Breville Barista Express if I'm not satisfied?**  This depends on the seller's return policy.  Always check the return policy before purchasing.


By carefully considering these factors and following the advice above, you can confidently purchase a refurbished Breville Barista Express and enjoy delicious espresso for years to come, all while saving a significant amount of money.

1hvrn9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1hvrn9b/oatly_otly_is_locked_value_ready_to_be_released/,OATLY ($OTLY) : Is Locked Value Ready to be Released?,"I have two different calculations in this, one for a potential buyout scenario and second one for remaining independent.

First of all, it is obvious (also shareprice is reflecting this), it is a distressed investment including risks (debt , profitability and current cash flow as main concerns). In order to consider investing in such cases, I try to look at asymmetrical risk and reward‚Ä¶ In this case, my personal opinion is reward is outpacing the risk ( which will be multiples of current share price ‚Äì which can be counted as the risk)‚Ä¶

**Starting with the buyout scenario‚Ä¶**¬†My personal consideration is Oatly will complement many multinational CPG‚Äôs portfolio like Coca Cola, Pepsi etc ; but for me the best leverage for both companies can be achieved by Nestle. They have a new CEO (Laurent Frexie) having 30 years of Nestle career, knowing Nescafe (coffee mate) business inside out, also targeting bringing growth back to Nestle- and Oatly is the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Both European companies, similar/same regulatory framework

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Nestle tried peamilk with plant based, failed and delisted. They still look for alternatives.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coffee mate business is bleeding, based on the latest financial reports for 2024, Coffee-Mate sales have faced some challenges, particularly in North America, where there has been a noted decline. Partially this is because of overall market situation , but more importantly plant based.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Many synergies possible : workforce, office consolidation, supply chain optimization and increase in distribution.

So numbers : Oatly as business can be absorbed quite quickly and easily with a big MNC having global footprint. Any buyout will cut this corporate costs significantly based on synergies to be generated and oatly articles will be just additional SKU‚Äôs in the assortment. In my opinion, this is also the reason why Oatly keeps reporting corporate (cost center) different than the three regions (P&L centers).

This corporate costs account for \~25M per quarter, almost 100M per year. This number can be up to a large extent saved by a smart merger. In addition, similar synergies will be achieved in the regions (sales force, production footprint, brand initiatives etc etc)‚Ä¶ It would not be off to think 30-40% of SG&A can be saved by all the synergies can be achieved, which will be an EBITDA contributor of 100M to 130M.

Given the natural progress achieved by the management brought quarterly losses from 50M to 5M in 6 quarters (potentially zero or green in Q4), overall EBITDA will be \~120M.

Given the growth potential that Nestle will bring in, a 20x multiplier will not be illogical. This will end up a 2.4B valuation which will bring share price to 4USD.

**The second one is having the company continuing operation independently and considering what they do**, and I see here 6 catalysts for revenue growth

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Starbucks removed in US/CANADA/Middle east surcharge of non-dairy. ¬†This is result of pull from market, but also will fuel additional consumption with one of the biggest key accounts of Oatly.

2)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As mentioned in my previous post, they announced extended partnership with CostCo and Walmart, hired business manager director level at Bentonville for Walmart and VP level for club and CostCo. These are world‚Äôs biggest and biggest third retailers.

3)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Bird flu in dairy in US can influence consumer behaviour as well as supply chain of dairy products. In November , USDA announced milk output was 9.8% less than November 2023.

4)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Partnerships in China on going. In an interview with regional president David Zhang, he mentioned they reached 100.000 point of sales in Greater China. Luckin extended it is limited time offering (inc Q2 2025) , with a potential for a permanent partnership. They also recently announced extended partnership with Tim Hortons China.

Zhang also mentioned price fluctuations and market consolidation is over in China, with few players remaining in the field. (Keep in mind that population in southeast asia is highest lactose intolerance in the world. Also coffee consumption is growing double digit, but still much lower compared to high consumption countries).

5)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† White space expansions are on going, recent big ones were Poland and Mexico, but also potentially ¬†there are more lined up.

6) Dairy industry is under pressure because of methane emissions and water consumption. Denmark announced to put cow tax starting from 2030, will most likely be followed by other countries. In addition, government subsidies will be challenged for an ""unsustainable"" industry. This will pressurize prices and close the price gap with plant-based.

Combining above revenue drivers with company effort to become profitable, with support from declining price of raw/pack and logistics, it would not be surprising to see more than 10-15% revenue growth in 2025 onwards , with positive EBITDA. For companies in fast-growing, health-oriented segments may have P/S ratios ranging from 2 to 5, therefore 900M sales will lead to a valuation for 1.8B to 4.5B , giving the stock price (net of debt) 2.5USD to 6.8USD.

So, in my opinion, even with the current financial difficulties (debt & profitability) ‚Äì Oatly fulfills the asymmetrical risk and reward opportunity‚Ä¶ Any thoughts?",12,1736257235.0,ValueInvesting,1,0.87,False

Known for its rich character, this grape variety offers a unique tasting experience that captivates wine enthusiasts around the globe. Whether you enjoy a robust glass or a spicy blend, understanding the nuances of Syrah/Shiraz can enhance your wine appreciation journey.

The flavor profile of Syrah/Shiraz is predominantly characterized by dark fruit flavors. You might encounter scents of blackberries, plums, and dark cherries.

I said I don‚Äôt mind him having the odd glass here or there (just not loads of it) because sharing is caring.

But I tested my sugars and they were really low - but I didn‚Äôt have my juice and I don‚Äôt have any sweets either.

So I ended up having a coffee with enough sugar in to rot the teeth of a small army.

I messaged him to complain and tried to emphasise the importance of me having access to juice.

He apologised but said I should try eating actual food.

I was hoping someone knowledgeable could help ID what's going on with my dog.

6 year old black lab mix
Female, 75lbs
On no medication

Back in October, she got up suddenly from under the coffee table and bonked her head slightly and fell backwards. She got back up, then looked unsteady on her feet. She then just laid down and didn't move much. After about an hour I got her to slowly walk around the yard, go the bathroom, and drink some water. I thought she was OK. Then she vomited during the night, and the next day just seemed extremely sluggish and didn't want to leave the bed. Later that day after she didn't improve, we took her to the emergency vet. There they did blood work, and a body ultrasound, looking at her organs. Everything looked good in the sonogram, and her blood work looked good. They gave her fluids and anti nausea medicine. By the next day she was fine. We figured it was a minor concussion. We went to our normal vet later that week, and they couldn't find anything wrong.

Then it happened again 30 days later, without her hitting her head. Just was on the couch and looked off, was sluggish and vomited overnight. So back to the emergency vet. Again did testing, and no issues discovered. Again with fluids and nausea medicine. This time they gave us some take home nausea medicine. Again better the next day.

Then it happened again 30 days later, though this time it was pretty minor, and she didn't vomit, and the take home medicine had her feeling better fairly quickly.

Now it just happened a 4th time this morning. This time a more pronounced I guess you would call it seizure. She started pawing us, walked around a little, then just became unsteady on her feet and collapsed. She's now laying down and breathing normally, but I'm going to guess won't want to move for several hours and will be nauseous.

Any idea on what to do? It seems to be happening once a month now.

We are so lost amd worried for our dog.

Strap in, because this world is as thrilling as it is overwhelming. Whether you‚Äôve been cooking up tracks for years or you‚Äôre just unboxing your first MIDI controller, this journey is a wild mix of frustration, creativity, and straight-up magic. And let me tell you‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something new to learn.

### So, what‚Äôs music production really about?
It‚Äôs not just dragging loops around in your DAW or tweaking the EQ until your snare cracks like lightning (though that *is* a good time). It‚Äôs about storytelling. You‚Äôre literally bending sound to express emotions, thoughts, cultures, moments. You‚Äôre turning *nothing but silence* into songs that people cry, dance, work, and vibe to.

Still, it can feel like staring into a giant, glossy wall of plug-ins, buttons, samples, and YouTube tutorials. That's okay. Even the pros were once fumbling around trying to figure out why their mix sounded like it was underwater.

### Here are some spicy truths they don‚Äôt tell you enough:
- The best gear is the gear you *already own.* Yes, fancy preamps and mics are great, but half the legends of music started with tape decks, broken keyboards, and honesty. Don‚Äôt sleep on the power of what‚Äôs inside your laptop or phone.
  
- Great producers are great listeners. If you‚Äôre not dissecting your favorite tunes, pulling apart grooves, or hyper-focusing on details like, ‚ÄúWhy did they do this filter fade RIGHT HERE?!‚Äù then you‚Äôre missing the cheat codes.

- Less is more. (Yes, even when you‚Äôre making layered, glitchy madness.) Sometimes muting one element in a mix transforms everything. Simplicity = clarity = more impact.

### Stuck in a rut? Try this:
- Assign yourself a challenge. Make a track in under two hours. Only use *one* synth. (You‚Äôll be shocked at how restrictions sometimes unleash creativity.)

- Flip a genre on its head. Try adding drill drums to a soft acoustic riff. Toss a trap bassline into a lo-fi track. Weird = wonderful.

- Give your ears a break. Seriously. *Walk away*. The best way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a mix sometimes is to not touch it for 12 hours and come back with fresh ears.

### But what about those terrifying holes of insecurity?
You know what I mean: when everything you make sounds like trash and you think, ‚ÄúWhy do I even bother?? There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm ever gonna put out a hit, right?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the hard truth: the difference between people *who make it* in music and those who quit is stubbornness. Tons of folks have talent, but the ones who stick around long enough to work it into actual skills? Those are the people who‚Äôll see the rewards. *Keep going.*

It‚Äôs also worth remembering that everything's subjective. What you hate about your track might be exactly what someone else loves about it. Perfectionism is the enemy here. Sometimes you just have to bounce it out and let it go.

### Some random advice sprinkles for the road:
- Invest in your monitors/headphones. You‚Äôll cry less when your mix translates on other systems. Trust me.
  
- Learn shortcuts for your DAW. Spending hours on repetitive tasks kills momentum faster than bad coffee. Ergonomics matter.
  
- Don‚Äôt skip music theory entirely. You don‚Äôt need to be Beethoven, but understanding harmony and scales can unlock so much.

- Share your work! Collaborate, get feedback, post in forums (like this one, hint hint). Connection is fuel.

So, what‚Äôs got *you* excited, frustrated, or curious about music production lately? Learned a slick new trick? Bought a new toy? Wrestling with a track that‚Äôs fighting you every step of the way? Drop your thoughts below. Let‚Äôs geek out‚Äîmusic style. üé∂",1,1736256082.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs a picture of my 2024 Wrap-Up card below, it shows 1105 hours across 69 games (nice). I bought and played some other new releases this year as well, and I also have my Switch, 3DS, and PC so there were a couple more things I played this year overall.¬†

I‚Äôve been in Nintendo‚Äôs grasp for most of my life, so I've been taking some time to catch up on stuff I missed on other consoles. 2024 was wildly productive in clearing my backlog, I think I only got to 21 Playstation games in 2023.¬†

My overall thoughts on PS+ is that it‚Äôs worth it if you are curious and have an eclectic taste in games. Saves you a lot of money if you have a large and varied backlog. Not very useful if you just have a main game or two that you play, but I guess PS forces you to sub for multiplayer. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs valuable for games with massive playtimes, such as the big AAA titles like from Bethesda on PS+, or long grinds like Terraria. It is literally cheaper to buy them outright than to possibly waste months of subscription on them, not to mention they might be taken off the catalog.¬†

Finally, I‚Äôve actually cancelled my yearly subscription when it ends this month. This is because while I managed to play a lot of games, many of them weren‚Äôt very high priority in my backlog. As games left the service, I‚Äôve kind of been trapped in a bit of FOMO, and jumping on a game that wasn‚Äôt top of my list just because of the upcoming ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù. This year, I‚Äôm focusing on a list of games I most want to play first, rather than racing against the clock. I am also prepping to tackle a couple of 100-hour JRPGs in my backlog this year, so it wouldn‚Äôt be worthwhile to maintain the subscription.¬†

But anyway, just thought it would be fun to share my thoughts on the value of PS+ for me, apologies for the long post.¬†

Maybe a little long sorry! 

I have a lot of doubt about what happened mid 2020- covid restrictions hadn't long since been lifted i met this guy outside work, said he worked in a different part of the hospital (saw his ID) and we got to chatting. Now im really bad at saying no to people/boundaries were worse then (hadn't had over a years worth of trauma therapy then either). We exhanged numbers got to going out for a coffee date. 

Now here is where i start being stupid. I offer to drive him back to his flat because it was cold/raining and a number of miles away and im a people pleaser or was then at least. He asks me in for coffee i thought okay. We were chatting for while he started turning the conversation to him wanting sex, i stated that i don't do that on first dates/until i know someone really well etc i already had vagismus so fine intercourse really hard/painful anyway. 

I'm trying to to be too graphic here so i'll spolier tag the worse bit he starts saying its about respecting the person not about sex itself he repeats this multiple times when i say i don't do this. Basically the spolier tag is SA/possible rape 

 >!so he then locks his door with me inside with him, so i feel trapped and he is bigger than me, taller and broader than me. I just go with it because what else can i do, i don't remember all the next details really i know clothes are off he is trying to penetrate and can't get all the way due to above condition which is painful obviously, i just lay there really and not say anything else (which maybe i should have but i probably froze honestly) he gives up at some point and seems angry, i try to explain the condition and he just ignores me and unlocks the door so i go home!< 

I don't tell anyone until about 2 years ago when my PTSD symptoms become more obvious to me and i have to get my mental health team involved etc. Even now i've only told a few friends and my therapist who say this is SA/Rape and i just don't really see it because he didn't get all the way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è this why i feel like it wasn't as bad even though i was in pain.

I just feel like i'm stupid, making it up, making it out to be worse, like im lying.

1hvr9e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1hvr9e7/just_venting_it_might_not_even_be_mcas_but_im/,Just venting & it might not even be MCAS but I‚Äôm miserable and just want to be myself again ,"I started getting sick after a concert in early July this past year, and just have been a mess ever since. 

At first I thought I had a cold I‚Äôd ride out. I did get better for a few weeks, but then I developed a cough, post nasal drip & vomiting - worse in the mornings and late at night. They treated me for bronchitis but it came back. 

In the past few months I‚Äôve been desperate going to doctors because now I get rashes/bumpy/textures skin on my neck/cheeks. 

I was diagnosed with asthma & take medications for that (a steroid inhaler & Singulair) and my cough has significantly improved to the point it‚Äôs not all day long unless I‚Äôm reacting to food. 

My primary basically said I had a cold or sinus infection in October even though I told him it started in July. 

I made an appointment with an ENT/allergist & I tested positive for cats, every single environmental allergy (trees, weeds, grass), but not mold/dust. I also tested as allergic to wheat, barley, rice, oats, corn, tomato, cocoa bean, peanuts, tree nuts, fish & strawberries. 

Please keep in mind, up until about October I ate all these foods - like corn on the cob or corn in my tomato salad, bagels daily, strawberry smoothies, rice meals twice a week, etc with no immediate reaction. 

Now I‚Äôm reacting to literally almost everything. Even like I‚Äôll eat one allergy safe meal one day just fine & the next eat the same thing & break out in a rash, wheezing & vomiting. 

I‚Äôm vomiting almost every day - most days 3-5 times a day. 

All I‚Äôve had this morning is my coffee & creamer with sugar (no corn additives) and I‚Äôm already puking. 

I used to eat McDonalds on my way home from closing shifts 1-2 times a week The other day I thought maybe I was making it all up/in a delusion so I got my regular order and took a Benadryl just in case. I woke up about an hour into my sleep to pee and my face and neck got hives & a rash. I have a psychotic disorder that I‚Äôve been symptom free of for over a year, but I wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt hallucinating it so I FaceTimed my mom who confirmed it was real. 

I started meal prepped safe foods and like the first time I eat it it‚Äôs fine. Then I bring left overs to work and have a reaction. 

I‚Äôll also just be vibing on a good day (normally when I simply don‚Äôt eat out of fear because nothing is safe and didn‚Äôt react to my coffee that day) and the in the afternoon randomly break out in red blotches, nausea/vomit, start coughing. 

My assistant has talked to me about me not being ‚Äúthere‚Äù at work because I‚Äôm taking sitting breaks due to lightheaded/dizziness / in the bathroom a lot. But idk what to do. I‚Äôm making really good money given I‚Äôm in management in the food industry and only have to work 45hours a week for my salary (normally 55hrs & lower salary for other equivalent jobs in my field). 

I‚Äôve looked into FMLA but I may not qualify due to only 2 other equivalent managers in the state so there would be no coverage without replacing me. And I also can‚Äôt afford to take unpaid time off due to my bills. 

I know yall can‚Äôt diagnose & I‚Äôm not asking for that. I don‚Äôt even know if this is MCAS, my old friend just mentioned it because she has it and said a lot of people in the Tourette‚Äôs community have it due to the histamine involvement with Tourette‚Äôs (which I have a diagnosis for since I was a kid). 

I know I‚Äôm allergic to cocoa/chocolate & oats/cereal because I have been since a kid. But all the other allergies went from non-existent to this so quickly. 

Maybe it is just severe allergies idk. I started a shot series for the environmental ones. 

Have an appointment with my allergist/ENT tomorrow, see my primary on Thursday, and made an appointment for next week with my GYN to rule out PCOS since I also used to have debilitating menstrual cramps before starting a specific birth control that stopped the cramps & my periods completely back in 2020. But over the past few weeks all symptoms have gotten worse, plus I have lower abdominal pain now which I haven‚Äôt in years. 

Is it worth making a $400 appointment with a MCAS speciality 45 minutes away from me to look into it or rule it out? I saw a post about him in a facebook group & people travel to see him, but I am local to his office. 

I‚Äôve already spent about $1.5k between copays, sinus CT my insurance didn‚Äôt cover, chest X ray for asthma, allergy testing and my allergy shot serum. 

I currently see my primary, the ent/allergist, and pulmonologist.  

Side note: I‚Äôm trying to quit vaping in case that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing this and the whole asthma thing but I don‚Äôt want to cold turkey due to mental health (I got severely depressed by day 4 last time I cold turkey quit). But I‚Äôm allergic to the adhesive on nicotine patches and have scars on my arm from the one day I wore a patch and got blisters. 

Also I used to be able to use smelly good body care products but now they make me go into a coughing fit/wheeze. Even the Dove sensitive skin body wash makes me get sick but idk what else to try so I‚Äôm currently just dealing with it because I have to take showers so I shower at night and take a Benadryl before my shower. 

Super long vent. If you read this - I appreciate you & understand those who don‚Äôt because oof.
