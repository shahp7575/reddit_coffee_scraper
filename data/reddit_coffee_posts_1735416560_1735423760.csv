It’s a vast expanse of the same color. Since my credenza and rug are patterned, I’m stumped as to what I can do on the wall behind the television which extends from the back of the house through the arch over the hallway. 
I did think of wallpaper like a grass cloth but with those patterns it could be too busy and since we have 11 door ceilings it will probably cost a fortune. 
Photos are current (pardon the cat toys) except the last one - changed lamp, added plant, switch to long acrylic coffee table, minor things. 
I’m sure I’m missing something, please tell me what it is! Thank you! ",1,1735423361.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

just another day for us,
for our beating hearts' anthem,
white socks, bedroom eyes in the kitchen,
the milk dripping off of your beard never goes to waste,
i think It's a bad omen to wipe it off with your fist.

I got my coffee, the light is slipping through your eyes,
you rest your foot on my thighs,
the Big Dipper on my upper left arm seems more obvious,
then I remembered my dream,
as I manifest the demise of my loneliness,
it's just that I fit right between your shoulders.

For 3 days I've been calling that random plumber I picked out of a newspaper, his name is Elias,
he never answers, and so you finally fix that leak I've been dreaming about, it's a Sunday morning after all,
i don't need to throw a tantrum,
then I bathe you of delinquency,
and we laugh in tandem,
for that leak is why we met.

1hoghzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1hoghzv/creepy_fedora/,Creepy Fedora,"Do you ever get that weird feeling like you’re being watched? Like you are not alone? Like someone... or someTHING... is out there? Usually, it’s just that, a feeling. You look around and quickly see a familiar, friendly face waving at you. But what about that similar feeling, with shivers running down your spine, with a small voice in your head telling you that something is off. Telling you that, when you look around, you are not going to see a friendly face.

...

It was sometime between seven and eight in the evening and, since it was winter, it was already dark outside. I was at the gym in Ljubljana with two of my closest friends. Clever fit in Situla. That was probably my favourite gym. Since they opened another Clever fit gym in Bežigrad the one in Situla usually wasn’t too busy, the equipment was in good condition and there was plenty of space. On that day however, it was pretty crowded. After arriving and meeting out front, we entered through the main entrance, scanned our RFID bracelets and looked around.  
“A lot of people.” I said. “What do we hit first?”  
“A woman.” Tim answered my question with no hesitation.  
We looked at him with a slight smile and look in our eyes that said, there was something wrong with him.  
“A gypsy?” Tim broke the five seconds long pause.  
“We need to find a girl with the biggest and sweatiest ass and just follow her.” We looked at Denis with confusion and laughed.  
Suddenly I got that creepy feeling I spoke about in the beginning. I felt like someone was watching me and that it wasn’t just a cute girl checking me out from across the room.  
“What’s wrong with you?” Denis asked after noticing I’d stopped following them towards the changing room and seeing the weird expression on my face.  
“Ehh nothing.”  
I chose to ignore it. I had gotten that weird feeling quite often recently. Ever since that night when I couldn’t sleep and decided to go for a walk.

I woke up suddenly, all sweaty, from a weird dream that... I couldn’t really remember. All I could recall were some freakishly long, pale arms and fingers. The fingers were grotesquely pointy. There was also another thing I could not get out of my head for days. A fedora. It looked... normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. But there was this weird feeling that accompanied it. The more I thought about the hat, the more uneasy I felt. I tried to fall back asleep but couldn’t. So, I got dressed, put on some shoes and went for a walk before it was time to leave for work. It was around two am so I had about three hours until my alarm clock was supposed to ring. I didn’t get far before I got that same uncomfortable feeling. I stopped and looked around. Where I was standing, was the beginning of a very badly lit park. Because I could not make out anything out of the ordinary anywhere around me, I kept going. Just... on higher alert. There was no rational reason for me to worry, at least from what I could see or hear, but I also did not want to ignore my instincts, so I decided to take a turn towards the main street with more traffic. Well. As much traffic as you can get in the middle of the night. I returned to the apartment at around 0330 hour, had a normal breakfast for once, drank a cup of coffee, showered and drove to work. Even though I had gotten that feeling again, time to time, I didn’t think much of it. I sort of got used to it and wrote it off as a probable stress side effect. Until that evening. The evening, I went to the gym with Tim and Denis.

We changed into our sportswear, locked our bags into lockers and stepped back out of the changing room. We took just a couple of steps looking around and trying to make a workout plan based on unoccupied equipment. That is when I felt it again. The feeling of being watched. The shivers. The goosebumps and the hair standing up on the back of my neck. This was the shortest amount of time between two separate incidents until now, not to mention this one was by far the more intense I have ever felt. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I looked around with a look that probably resembled that of a deer in front of a pair of headlights, if the deer was also pretty annoyed at this point.  
This time it did not take me long to find him. I just started staring, I could not look away. The awful feeling got even worse. And the man... the... thing... was staring right back at me. Even though I had never seen him before, I immediately recognised him by the long, thin arms and fingers... and the fedora. He was tall, wearing a dark grey woollen coat, his arms were as grotesquely long, like were his fingers, as in my dream. I couldn’t even see the end of his long, pale pointy fingers through the crowd from across the gym. Even though he was on the other side of the gym, it was like he was right in front of me, a meter (about three feet) away. I could clearly see the buttons on his coat, the long, slender, unnaturally pale neck leading up to... the face...  
The face had only one really noticeable feature. A long thin slit across, that I could only assume, was his mouth. It went from where one ear was supposed to be, to where the other one was also missing. I couldn’t even see the eyes from under the fedora, but I could feel his... or its... look. I was staring at the fedora, I got dizzy, the room started to spin slightly and everything else in my vision around the entity got blurry. Must've been seconds, but it felt like hours to me before I could finally get a sentence out of my mouth.  
“Are you guys seeing this?” I stuttered quietly without breaking eye contact.  
Tim slowly leaned towards me looking in the same direction.  
“Black people, am I right?”  
“What?”  
“What?”  
I looked at Tim with a confused look and as I turned back, the entity was gone. I noticed a large, muscular black man, roughly in the same direction. He was bench pressing the weight of a small car.  
“That one would’ve been pretty expensive back in the day.” Tim added.  
“You’re telling me you didn’t see the guy in the coat.”  
“Nope.”  
“What are you guys doing?” Asked Denis as he stepped closer to us.  
“Luka is watching dudes in coats.”  
“Gay.” Was Denis quick with his response.  
I let out a nervous laughter, as I still hadn’t completely shaken the dizziness, but genuinely found their comments funny, and told them to go fuck themselves. Denis then quickly informed me about the general lack of clothing of the female population and the appealing figures, as well as about his desired action, had he come into closer contact with one of the attractive females. I immediately wanted to erase that interaction from my memory.

I was still shaken from the encounter with the materialization of my nightmare. I had a feeling this was not the last time that I had seen... or heard... of the creepy fedora. I had no idea, however, ... how right... I was.

1hogh3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1hogh3x/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I have tons of friends but none who live nearby, and I'm starting to miss the day-to-day stuff like grabbing coffee, going the cinema etc. I am hoping to find people who either share interests or have recommendations for where to meet people non-romantically.

Some general stuff about me: I am very friendly and easy-going. I love videogames, boardgames, reading and I'm pretty open-minded about picking up a new creative hobby or something similar. I mostly play simulation/narrative games, but I'll try playing almost anything with my friends at least once. My favourite boardgames are cooperative ones but again, I'll try most games once. I love reading thrillers/horrors the most, but I have a soft spot for ridiculous romances and I read a wide variety of fiction. I also love watching cheesy/bad films or old childhood favourites, like Disney.

In terms of friends, I'm not really fussed about age or gender but ideally not hugely younger than me. Being queer-friendly is a must. I want to message people a bit on here first before meeting just because of safety really, so please don't be offended by that. I also won't take offence if we don't 'click' so don't worry about hurting my feelings! Honesty is more important to me :)",8,1735422902.0,Liverpool,0,1.0,False

I need some help with the choice for a coffee machine. Me and my wife love coffee, but are no real experts. So far we have a Delonghi Dedica and a Wilfa Svart Uniform as a grinder. For our wedding we got a voucher for an espresso machine and we need your help on deciding the machine. Usually we drink only cappuchino, around 2-3 cups per day, in the morning. Sometimes we have friends over, then we would probably also do espresso. For us it would be good if the machine is easy to work with, makes great coffee and is robust. 

At the moment we tend towards a   
\- Rocket Appartamento: [https://www.mobacoffee.de/Rocket-Appartamento-TCA-Inox-Kupfer](https://www.mobacoffee.de/Rocket-Appartamento-TCA-Inox-Kupfer)  
  
But as alternative options we were thinking about the   
\- Ascaso Steel Duo PID: [https://www.mobacoffee.de/Ascaso-Steel-Duo-PID-Schwarz-Holz](https://www.mobacoffee.de/Ascaso-Steel-Duo-PID-Schwarz-Holz)  
\- Profitec Move [https://www.profitec-espresso.com/produkte/move](https://www.profitec-espresso.com/produkte/move)

However both the Ascaso and Profitec are more expensive and seem to have a lot of settings we will probably not use, both of them are supposed to have faster heating compared to the Rocket, but at least for the mornings we could just use a time switch.

I'm also not sure if we should get another coffee grinder. Or do you think it will be alright with the Wilfa Svart? Please also share if you have other suggestions.

Thank you :)!",1,1735422802.0,barista,0,1.0,False

First, every coffee cup ever on screen is empty and it's annoying. Put some water in to weigh it down producers, please.

Second, I always watch the extras as the fact that they aren't allowed to speak makes me giggle. Especially when they're interacting with speaking cast members (and one episode played the parents of a kid that was sick, which made the no lines even more silly).

Third, the overuse of green screens and silly backdrops. Seems lazy, but it probably made things cheaper.

Most specifically coffee! Personally do not think it’s sanitary at all to get coffee from Wawa, between knowing the system, and having witnessed hundreds of coworkers make coffee I think it’s ridiculous Wawa has not gotten the automatic dispensers. 
For those unaware Sheetz has automated coffee machines that don’t allow for any human error, no whistling at employees to get a fresh pot, none of the unsanitary build up in age old pots. 

They always wrap your food in heat holding foil, and bag it up for you… none of the “oh sorry we dont have bags in the deli” or nasty wet sandwiches on paper. I understand that at Wawa we have a “cult” like following but I think if any Wawa customer went to Sheetz even once they’d change sides. I’m open to people’s thoughts, I think many of these are crucial steps to customer satisfaction that Wawa doesn’t care about.",5,1735422603.0,Wawa,5,0.73,False

1hog90z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1hog90z/niche_into_innovation_strategy_ai_ar_ecommerce/,"Niche into Innovation strategy - AI, AR, eCommerce?","Hi everyone!

I'm a **Product Innovation Strategist in Tech** with a background in **eCommerce and engineering**. I’m looking to pivot into **AI and AR products**, focusing on **UX design** and taking them to **Product-Market Fit**. For example:

* **AR virtual try-ons** for FashionTech to boost conversion rates
* **Conversational AI interfaces** that display helpful metadata over products

# Looking for Advice

I’ve noticed people in this space are often in **Big Tech (Meta)** or **startups**. I think I should:

1. **Cold DM** my FashionTech and innovation network for coffee chats
2. **Blog case studies** or build a **portfolio** (but I’m unsure what to include—maybe UX case studies?)
3. Explore **hands-on experience** by contributing to projects like an **Apple Vision Pro app**

For context, I’ve written a **market analysis of AR glasses** (like the Ray-Ban Metas with AR displays coming next year!) and a blog about **AI/AR tools for scalable motion graphics in the Metaverse**.

# Where I Excel

I’ve been in **Product Management** for a while, but it’s often tactical, operational, or project management-heavy. My strength lies in **deep innovation strategy** (mindful introvert insights lol) at the intersection of business, engineering, and design. For instance:

* Comparing two generative AI 3D visualization models for **fashion product recommendations**
* Assessing their **scalability across devices** and their impact on **conversion rates**
* Giving talks, especially sharing UX learnings on innovation products. Explaining high-Tech topics clearly

But how do I brand or position myself to focus on this kind of “deep work”?

# Seeking Insights

If you work in this space, I’d love to hear about:

* **Your journey or experience**
* How to carve out a niche in innovation strategy for AI/AR
* **Leaders or innovators** to follow—especially women in FashionTech!

I currently follow the innovation teams of several **luxury fashion houses** pioneering AR apps. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!

1hog8gt,https://i.redd.it/3ong3z56un9e1.jpeg,Jing Yuan's operation ~~grand~~ child,"""Fuck me!"" Jing Yuan yelled as he chugged what seemed to be a mixture of coffee and Everclear. He was drunk, angry, and a little horny. 

Across from him sat Fu Xuan. Confused about why she was called, she just looked at Jing Yuan in this sorrowful state. ""General... why are you like this? It seems you are upset.""

Jing Yuan looks at her with the eye of predatory hunger. ""Jingliu and Blade are fucking Yanqing and Yunli."" 

""What?"" Asks Fu Xuan, more confused than before.

""Blade cucked Yanqing by fucking his niece. Jingliu is grooming Yanqing, which is fine...""

""Fine!"" Yelled Fu Xuan, angered by the fact that he was okay with his son being a victim 

""Let me finish..."" With a long swig from his cup, Jing Yuan examples himself.

""I would be okay with it if she was FERTILE!!!"" 
Jing Yuan throws the cup at his wall, so hard that is does it break but embeds itself into the wall. ""Not an egg in that bitch! And Blade, he's been shooting blanks for centuries! Neither of them are getting pregnant.""

Fu Xuan looks at Jing Yuan with fear. 
""Genral, I...""

Jing Yuan puts his finger on her lips, silencing her. ""1st, it Jing Yuan. 2nd, you are so fucking hot. Like, damn, I love small tits and petite women. 3rd, I want children.""

Fu Xuan, now feeling very uncomfortable, moves his hand. ""Jing Yuan, you are being highly inappropriate. You can't just...""

""I want to have fuck with you.""

""Excuse me!"" Fu Xuan's heart almost exploded at Jing Yuan confession.

""I want kids. My ex girlfriend is married and is going to have kids. All my friends have kids. I want kids!"" Jing Yuan slams his desk every time he says kids. He grabs the bottle of Everclear from under his desk and chugs it.

""I don't think you're supposed to drink by itself.""

""Shut up your breedable ass..."" Jing Yuan has lost all of his sex appeal, his cool personality, his laid back nature. It has all been replaced by a horny drunken mess. ""Oh sweet Lan, you have such a breedable body. I love Cunny so much. So much~""

It takes a full minute before Fu Xuan can even speak, trying to find the right way to respond to what he just said. ""What is cunny? What... what is wrong with you?"" 

""I'm willing to give you whatever you want if you make a baby with me. Anything."" Jing Yuan is clearly desperate, wanting a small baby to call his own. 

""Why me?"" Asked Fu Xuan, "" there's thousands of women of petite stature on the Luofu, so why me?""

""I like your ass. And tits. So small it can fit in the palm of my hand. And that third eye makes me want to mind fuck you.""

Fu Xuan is once again shocked by Jing Yuan forwardness. ""Okay, look, please stop before I report you to the marshall.""

""I will make you my co-general. Fuck, I'll step down and make you the general. Just let's make babies, please."" 

As soon as Fu Xuan heard that she could be made the general if she does this, she whips out a piece of paper and a pen. ""You're gonna write down that right here so that everyone knows.""

""Okay."" With a drunken signature, Jing Yuan makes it official. 

""So now let's got you do the bedroom."" Fu Xuan helps Jing Yuan to the bedroom. But as she does, Yanqing appears out of nowhere.

""General Jing Yuan, I'm gonna have sword training with Jingliu... Miss Fu Xuan, what are you doing with my dad?""

With a quick and snappy retort, ""I'm gonna fuck your dad, Yanqing.""",17,1735422528.0,okbuddytrailblazer,4,1.0,False

1hog7d1,https://i.redd.it/tpvqgewwtn9e1.jpeg,AIO - 9 mo pregnant and refused to spend holidays w my family,"AIO - 9 mo pregnant and refused to spend holidays with my family 

I’m 37 weeks pregnant. My doctor told me the baby could come early, so I’m potentially days or weeks away from meet our little one!

It’s our first baby and I’m excited but also nervous about giving birth. I’ve done everything I can to avoid being sick while giving birth. Got my shots, and both me and my husband wore masks and frequently washed hands at all large family gatherings (so far just on husbands side). It’s been annoying to wear one for hours and hours at family events where we’re also eating and drinking, but his family has been nothing but understanding and supportive, knowing I could pop any day. 

We had planned a belated Christmas with my side of the family this weekend. For context, I live about 2 hours from them.

My dad spent the day babysitting at my sisters house on Friday, then both my parents came to my house as planned on Friday night. Before they got here, I called to check in and told them again how we’ve been being extra careful, and asked if they think they might be sick or around sick people. They adamantly said no they were fine. 

When they came over, my dad kept sneezing and coughing. I asked again if he was sick. He again adamantly denied and started raising his voice at me, telling me I’m being ridiculous. I told him I’m going to wear a mask just in case anyway. He would not wear one, nor would he move from where he was next to me on the couch. I got up myself and grabbed a chair and sat several feet away. They were only in the house with us for about an hour, then we went to dinner with one of their friends, where none of us wore masks. We then went home and they slept at a friends house, as planned ( we don’t have any extra bedrooms). 

Saturday morning, we were planning to meet with them around noon. I was texting my mom when I should plan on loading up Christmas dinner to bring over to them (and my sister who was also planning to come), and she ignored my question. She then just replied asking me to buy them coffee beans. hours later in a group chat with my sister, she texted me when am I coming over. 

Before we headed over, my sister called me that she was on the way. She seemed really stressed and I asked why. She said something has been going around at the hospital she works at and she’s been sick for days, and it spread to her infant, who my dad was babysitting yesterday. She didn’t want to come because she was worried about getting others sick (especially me), but my parents were pressuring her to come. I asked if my dad knew she and the baby, who he was just with yesterday, we’re sick. She said yes of course. I was furious. He told me so many times there was no way he was sick and wasn’t around anyone who was. He knowingly lied. 

I called my parents and told them I knew my sister and her baby are sick and I’m not coming. And also that I shouldn’t have been with them yesterday since my dad was clearly exposed to whatever they have. I told them I had Christmas dinner in the car and would leave it and the Christmas presents on the porch, and asked they leave anything they wanted to give me outside for a contactless swap. 

They said nothing in response to them intentionally exposing me, and just responded that they didn’t feel ‘safe’ leaving presents outside. I told them please just don’t fight me on this. They were annoyed and just said ok. I got there and there’s nothing outside. They insist we come in the house to get the gifts. They’re not wearing masks. 

I text them the attached pic. AIO? 
They never answered. ",6,1735422441.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

But here we are: ChatGPT is writing code. GitHub Copilot is pair programming like it’s had 5 cups of coffee.**

Meanwhile, developers are sitting back, sipping lattes, and wondering, ""Did we just automate ourselves out of a job?""

But let’s be real:

ChatGPT may write code, but who’s going to explain to it that “It works on my machine” isn’t a feature?

GitHub Copilot can predict your next line of code, but will it argue with the designer over padding vs. margin?

Here’s the twist: The developer era isn’t ending—it’s evolving. We’re not just coders anymore; we’re code whisperers, AI wranglers, and bug therapists.

So, instead of fearing the bots, let’s make them our interns. Let them do the boring stuff while we focus on being the creative geniuses we’ve always been.

Because no AI will ever truly replace:

Debugging at 3 AM while crying.

Googling ""how to reverse a string in JavaScript"" for the 100th time.

And, of course, writing comments like “TODO: Fix this later.”

Developers: 1. AI: 0. Game on. ✌️

I'm a **Product Innovation Strategist in Tech** with a background in **eCommerce and engineering**. I’m looking to pivot into **AI and AR products**, focusing on **UX design** and taking them to **Product-Market Fit**. For example:

* **AR virtual try-ons** for FashionTech to boost conversion rates
* **Conversational AI interfaces** that display helpful metadata over products

# Looking for Advice

I’ve noticed people in this space are often in **Big Tech (Meta)** or **startups**. I think I should:

1. **Cold DM** my FashionTech and innovation network for coffee chats
2. **Blog case studies** or build a **portfolio** (but I’m unsure what to include—maybe UX case studies?)
3. Explore **hands-on experience** by contributing to projects like an **Apple Vision Pro app**

For context, I’ve written a **market analysis of AR glasses** (like the Ray-Ban Metas with AR displays coming next year!) and a blog about **AI/AR tools for scalable motion graphics in the Metaverse**.

# Where I Excel

I’ve been in **Product Management** for a while, but it’s often tactical, operational, or project management-heavy. My strength lies in **deep innovation strategy** (mindful introvert insights lol) at the intersection of business, engineering, and design. For instance:

* Comparing two generative AI 3D visualization models for **fashion product recommendations**
* Assessing their **scalability across devices** and their impact on **conversion rates**
* Giving talks, especially sharing UX learnings on innovation products. Explaining high-Tech topics clearly

But how do I brand or position myself to focus on this kind of “deep work”?

# Seeking Insights

If you work in this space, I’d love to hear about:

* **Your journey or experience**
* How to carve out a niche in innovation strategy for AI/AR
* **Leaders or innovators** to follow—especially women in FashionTech!

I currently follow the innovation teams of several **luxury fashion houses** pioneering AR apps. Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!

One mentioned that the amount of proteins/amino acids in green tea is very small, so there should be no issue.

However, according to this article: https://www.tea-and-coffee.com/blog/jasmine-tea-benefits

They mentioned

Treats all of his children like subservient slaves and property to control. Long story short. They are here now on holiday and I do not tolerate his behaviour although my wife tells me to be patient and non confrontational. I witnessed this man throw coffee on my dog many years ago, and other abhorrent behaviour towards his wife and other family members. I won't go into detail but he is emotionally and physically abusive personality type. I have never liked him and have always stood up to him and like the weak man he is he always backs down. 
 So this bring s me to the latest situation, I almost punched him out for his behaviour, I am at my wits end and my wife is afraid of confrontation. Help pls.",1,1735421933.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I'm  38 years old have been training in a Shorin-ryu style for 20 years now. Tore my Distal Bicep Tendon and had surgery 5 weeks ago. Wondering if anyone in this sub has had the same injury and surgery. Specifically the Distal Bicep Repair that involves the tendon being sewn to a button and fed through a hole that is drilled into the bone and anchored with a set screw. 
     What was your recovery time? How long before you could pick up the chi-ishi and train makiwara? Did you regain 100% strength and full range of motion?
     I just got my splint off a week ago and was told by my doctor to move my arm freely to regain my movement the best I can before I begin physical therapy in 2 weeks. I was also told not to lift anything heavier than a cup of coffee and to only focus on movement for the time being.
     I have been walking through Seisan kata along with some qi-gong exercises and taking things very slow. It's seems to be helping.

Someone who claims to be an famous actor (whose IG posts I sometimes comment on) has been chatting me up online, and I am so confused. They started following me and liking my posts on IG from a personal IG account that's private and doesn't even have a profile photo, and their writing doesn't sound like the way the real person talks, so I've assumed I'm being catfished. Their name on the profile is also misspelled. Sounds totally (cat)fishy, right?

I told him (or her, who knows?) I didn't believe he was the real guy, and he started insisting it's really him--explaining that he misspelled his name on that profile on purpose, so there wouldn't be so many people finding him and flooding his DMs, blah blah blah. He asked if we could continue messaging on Telegram, as his social media team has access to his IG accounts, and I agreed, but only after setting all my privacy settings on there SKY high so he can't get any private info about me.  

He offered to leave me a voice message on Signal so I could tell it was actually him, and he did. It does sound like him, and he has a distinctive voice. But people can use AI to clone someone's voice, and there's plenty of video footage of him online to use as source material. 

We've exchanged a couple more messages, and their writing sounds a teeny bit stiff and fakeish, like it might have been written by ChatGPT. But I'm not blocking this person because... What if it's really him? I know the chances are slim, but still... Ya never know. I would absolutely love to meet this person, and without trying to sound bigheaded, from what I've seen, I'm kinda his type. And some people who speak well just aren't so great at writing. 

We don't live in the same city, but I'll be traveling to his city soon (for unrelated reasons, of course), so I suggested we just meet for a coffee when I'm there (somewhere definitely very public), to remove all doubt. He said that sounds good. Guess I'll find out if he means it.  

But what I'm trying to figure out here is; what kind of scam could this person be running, if it isn't him? Do people just catfish other people just for the occasional exchange of messages? Surely this person knows I'm not going to give them money--I already made it VERY clear that I'm highly skeptical about the whole situation. 

So what else could this be about? I'm new to all this--never been catfished before. Any insight will be appreciated!",1,1735421415.0,catfish,2,0.67,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Drinking water might seem like a simple act, but there's a fascinating science underlying this everyday behavior. Understanding the process of how you drink water not only enhances your appreciation of hydration but also informs how you can stay healthy.

### What Happens in Your Body

When you decide to drink water, several physiological processes are at play. First, your brain sends signals indicating the need for hydration. This urge is prompted by various factors, including physical activity, climate, or even the foods you consume. Your body's thirst mechanism is essential for ensuring you maintain the proper balance of fluids.

#### The Journey Begins

As you bring a glass of water to your lips, the initial step involves your mouth and throat, particularly your tongue. You may not realize it, but tasting the water begins even before you swallow. The sensory receptors on your taste buds assess the liquid, providing feedback to your brain. This experience helps coordinate the rest of the swallowing action.

#### The Swallowing Mechanism

Once the water is in your mouth, you engage in a series of coordinated movements. Here’s the breakdown:

- **Voluntary Control:** Initially, you consciously push the water to the back of your throat.
- **Involuntary Response:** Once the water reaches a certain point, the swallowing reflex takes over. This prevents choking and directs the water toward the esophagus.
- **Esophagus Passage:** The esophagus uses peristalsis—muscle contractions that move food and liquids toward your stomach.

### The Role of the Stomach

After the water travels down the esophagus, it reaches the stomach. Here, the body works tirelessly to manage hydration. Unlike solid food, water doesn't require extensive digestion. Instead, it quickly starts absorbing through the stomach lining and into the bloodstream. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours, depending on various factors like the amount of food already in your stomach.

#### Hydration and Absorption

Once in the bloodstream, the water samples every cell in your body. This vital fluid plays numerous roles:

- **Aids in Digestion:** Water helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients more effectively.
- **Regulates Temperature:** Adequate hydration keeps your body temperature stable, especially during physical exertion.
- **Supports Cellular Functions:** Without sufficient water, cells struggle to perform necessary functions.

### Health Benefits of Drinking Water

Drinking enough water proves essential for maintaining health and well-being. Each step of the process highlights the importance of staying hydrated. Here are a few significant benefits:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Boosts Energy Levels:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue, making it vital to gulp down water regularly.
- **Improves Skin Health:** Hydration plays a crucial role in maintaining elasticity and moisture in your skin.
- **Enhances Brain Function:** Even mild dehydration can impact focus, memory, and mood.

#### Tips for Staying Hydrated

To ensure you are drinking enough water, consider these practical tips:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Make it easy to sip water throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone to prompt hydration breaks.
- **Incorporate Fruits and Veggies:** Foods with high water content, like cucumbers and watermelon, can boost hydration.

### The Myth of Eight Glasses a Day

You may have heard that you should drink eight glasses of water daily. While it’s a handy guideline, hydration needs vary by individual. Factors like age, activity level, and the climate you live in can influence how much water you need. Listening to your body and drinking whenever you feel thirsty is key.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
The process of drinking water spans from the moment you lift that glass to the absorption of water in your cells. By understanding this intricate process, you can appreciate the value of hydration and its impact on your overall health. Make drinking water a priority in your daily routine, and your body will thank you!

The Importance of Hydration for Overall Health
----------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is one of the most important aspects of maintaining overall health. Water makes up a significant portion of our bodies and is essential for various functions. Yet, many people overlook the importance of proper hydration, often opting for sugary drinks or skipping water altogether.

One of the main reasons hydration is vital is that it aids in digestion. When you drink enough water, it helps break down food, making nutrients easier to absorb. This process is crucial for your body to gain the energy it needs from the food you consume. Without proper hydration, digestion can slow down and lead to discomfort.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Furthermore, hydration plays a key role in regulating body temperature. When you sweat, your body loses water; this fluid must be replenished to keep your temperature stable. Engaging in physical activity or spending time in hot environments makes staying hydrated even more critical.

Moreover, drinking enough water helps protect your joints. Synovial fluid, which cushions your joints, is primarily made up of water. Therefore, adequate hydration is necessary to maintain joint flexibility and prevent stiffness, particularly as you age.

You might be surprised to learn that staying well-hydrated also impacts your skin's health. Water helps maintain skin elasticity and hydration, giving you a youthful appearance. Dehydrated skin can lead to dryness, flakiness, and premature aging.

Here are some key benefits of staying hydrated:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Improved Energy Levels:** Water is essential for maintaining energy throughout the day. Dehydration can result in fatigue and a lack of focus.
- **Weight Management:** Sometimes the body confuses thirst for hunger. Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller, potentially reducing calorie intake.
- **Enhanced Mood:** Staying hydrated can positively impact your mood and cognitive functions. Research shows that even mild dehydration can result in mood changes and increased feelings of anxiety.
- **Better Physical Performance:** Water helps transport nutrients to cells, which can improve performance during exercise. Dehydration can lead to reduced endurance and increased fatigue.

So, how do you ensure you’re drinking enough water? First, it's essential to know your daily water needs. A common guideline is to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, known as the “8x8 rule.” However, individual needs can vary based on factors like age, sex, weight, and activity level.

Another great tip is to keep a reusable water bottle with you throughout the day. This way, you'll have water on hand and can easily track how much you're consuming. Additionally, setting reminders on your phone or using apps can help boost your intake, ensuring you never forget to drink.

You can also hydrate through food. Many fruits and vegetables have high water content, such as cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges. Including these foods in your diet can help you reach your hydration goals without solely relying on drinking water.

It's essential to listen to your body. Signs of dehydration may include dry mouth, fatigue, headaches, or feeling unusually thirsty. If you experience these symptoms, it's critical to drink water promptly.

Remember that while water is the best source of hydration, other beverages and even caffeine can contribute. However, be cautious with sugary drinks, as they can lead to unnecessary calorie intake and may not effectively hydrate you. Prioritizing water and natural sources of hydration is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Hydration is an integral part of promoting overall health. By understanding the benefits and employing strategies to drink enough water, you can improve your digestion, enhance your mood, maintain energy, and support your physical health. Make drinking water a priority, and your body will thank you for it.

Common Myths and Misconceptions About Drinking Water
----------------------------------------------------

Drinking water is essential for our health and well-being, yet many people hold myths and misconceptions about it. These misunderstandings can lead to confusion about how much water we should drink, the best time to drink it, and its effects on our bodies. Let's explore some of the most common myths surrounding drinking water to help you better understand what you need for optimal hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most widespread beliefs is that everyone needs to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, often referred to as the ""8x8 rule."" While staying hydrated is crucial, the amount of water you need can vary significantly based on several factors, including age, activity level, and climate. For example, if you exercise regularly or live in a hot environment, you may need to drink more water than the average person.

#### Fact: Individual Hydration Needs Vary

Instead of counting glasses, listen to your body's signals. Thirst is a reliable indicator that you need water. You can also assess your hydration level by checking the color of your urine: clear to light yellow typically indicates adequate hydration, while dark yellow could suggest you need more fluids.

### Myth: Drinking Water Can Help You Lose Weight

While drinking water is vital for various bodily functions, it's a common myth that it directly leads to weight loss. Many people believe that drinking water boosts metabolism or burns calories, but that’s not entirely accurate.

#### Fact: Water Can Support Weight Management

Water may help with weight management by acting as a filler before meals, leading to reduced calorie intake. For some, replacing high-calorie beverages with water can also contribute to fewer calories consumed daily. However, it should be seen as one part of a balanced diet and an active lifestyle rather than a quick-fix solution for weight loss.

### Myth: You Can’t Drink Too Much Water

It’s hard to imagine that too much water could be harmful, but it definitely can be. Some individuals believe that drinking excessive water is simply beneficial and won't pose any risk. This misconception can lead to a condition known as water intoxication or hyponatremia, where the sodium levels in your blood become dangerously low.

#### Fact: Moderation is Key

While it’s vital to stay well-hydrated, balance is crucial. Drinking water in moderation, based on your body’s signals and needs, is the best approach. Pay attention to how you feel and adjust your intake accordingly.

### Myth: All Beverages Hydrate You Equally

Some people think that all liquids are the same when it comes to hydration. While it's true that drinks like tea, coffee, and juice contain water, they often have added ingredients that can lead to dehydration.

#### Fact: Water is the Best Hydration Source

For optimal hydration, plain water remains the best choice. Sugary drinks, sodas, and caffeinated beverages can sometimes have diuretic effects, leading to increased urination and potentially causing dehydration. Water is calorie-free, caffeine-free, and doesn't contain sugar, making it the healthiest option.

### Myth: Cold Water is Unhealthy

Many believe that drinking cold water can lead to health issues, such as a sore throat or digestive problems. This belief may stem from cultural practices or personal anecdotes rather than scientific evidence.

#### Fact: Temperature Doesn't Significantly Affect Hydration

Drinking cold or room temperature water is a personal choice and does not influence its effects on hydration. The essential factor is consuming the necessary amount throughout the day, regardless of the water's temperature.

### Myth: You Should Drink Water Before, During, and After Meals

Some people assume drinking water at meals interferes with digestion. This thought might prevent them from hydrating adequately during meals.

#### Fact: Water Aids Digestion

Drinking water before, during, or after meals can actually benefit digestion. It helps break down food more effectively, allowing nutrients to be absorbed. Feel free to consume water alongside your meals without fear of hindering digestion.

Understanding the truths and myths about drinking water is essential for your overall health. By staying informed and adjusting your habits based on factual information, you can make the best choices for your hydration needs.

Different Methods of Drinking Water: Which is Best?

There are multiple ways people consume water, and each method comes with its own set of advantages. Exploring different methods can help you decide which one is best for you.

How Water Quality Affects Your Drinking Experience
--------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, but have you thought about what makes the experience of drinking water enjoyable or unpleasant? The quality of the water you drink plays a significant role in how refreshing and satisfying it can be. From the taste and odor to the clarity and safety of the water, several key factors influence your drinking experience.

### Factors Affecting Water Quality

Understanding how various elements affect water quality can help you make better choices about what you drink. Below are primary components that contribute to the overall experience:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Taste:** The taste of water can be affected by minerals, chemical treatments, and even the source. For instance, well water may contain a higher mineral content, which can lead to a more earthy flavor.
- **Odor:** Any unpleasant smell can deter you from drinking water. Chlorine, often used in municipal water systems for sanitation, can impart a strong odor, while sulfur can give a rotten egg smell.
- **Appearance:** Cloudy or discolored water can create concerns about cleanliness and safety. Clear, sparkling water, on the other hand, tends to be more appealing.
- **Temperature:** Most people prefer drinking cold water, especially on hot days. The temperature can affect your perception of taste and refreshment.
- **Safety:** Safe drinking water is free from harmful contaminants. It's crucial to know whether your water supply meets regulatory health standards.

### The Role of Minerals

Minerals in water can significantly influence the taste. Here are some common minerals and their effects on drinking water:

- **Calcium:** Often found in hard water, calcium can give water a creamy texture and slightly sweet taste.
- **Magnesium:** This mineral adds a slightly bitter taste to the water, which can be either appealing or unpleasant, depending on your preference.
- **Sodium:** Higher sodium levels can contribute to a salty flavor, which is often undesirable in drinking water.

### Common Water Contaminants

Knowing about contaminants can help you understand why water quality matters. Here are some common substances that can negatively affect your drinking experience:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Chlorine and Chloramine:** These disinfectants can leave an aftertaste and odor in tap water.
- **Lead:** Even small amounts can threaten health, giving a metallic taste to the water.
- **Bacteria:** Any growth can make water unsafe, and it may result in unpleasant odors and tastes.
- **Pesticides:** These can seep into water supplies and alter the flavor, potentially leading to health risks.

### Enhancing Your Drinking Experience

Improving your water quality can significantly enhance your hydration experience. Here are some practical tips:

- **Use a filter:** Filtering your water can remove contaminants, improving both safety and taste.
- **Try flavored water:** Infusing your water with fruits or herbs can make drinking more enjoyable while still hydrating.
- **Choose bottled water wisely:** If opting for bottled water, pay attention to the label to ensure you're choosing pure, safe options.

It’s also essential to stay informed about your local water quality. Many municipal water systems provide annual water quality reports, which can give insights into the safety and quality of the water supply.

### The Importance of Hydration

Water quality affects more than just the taste. It can impact your overall hydration experience. Ideally, good quality water helps you feel rejuvenated and energized. On the contrary, if the water tastes bad or smells off, you may find it hard to drink enough, leading to dehydration.

Quality water into your daily routine doesn’t have to be complicated. Paying attention to the nuances of your drinking water can dramatically improve your hydration experience. Ultimately, by being aware of how water quality affects you, you can make informed decisions to enhance your daily hydration habits.

### Conclusion

Bringing together the insights we've explored about the science behind how you drink water, we uncover the fundamental role hydration plays in your overall health. From the biological processes that enable your body to utilize water effectively to the common myths that can mislead your drinking habits, a clear understanding helps you make better choices. Being well-hydrated improves your physical performance, mental clarity, and even your skin health, proving just how vital water is to your well-being.

We've also identified various methods of drinking water, emphasizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach; whether you prefer sipping from a bottle, using a glass, or enjoying a sports drink during exercise, the best method is the one that fits your lifestyle and preferences. Furthermore, the quality of the water you consume is paramount. Clean, safe water enhances your drinking experience and can have a significant impact on your health.

As you embrace proper hydration, remember that drinking water is more than a simple act—it's a vital practice that supports every cell in your body. By busting misconceptions, ensuring water quality, and adopting an enjoyable drinking method, you can foster a healthier you. Stay curious about your hydration habits, listen to your body, and make water a cornerstone of your daily routine. Your health will thank you for it!

The bubbling process is fun to watch and it looks great in the countertop.  That said, the coffee just isn’t much better or worse than the Braun I had prior to it.  I mean how could it be?  I feel like a lot of the hype around the machine is in justifying its rather exorbitant cost for what is really, a coffeemaker.  There’s no real magic, it dumps water on coffee grounds.  I suppose the ‘exacting temperature it produces could be seen as a unique feature but I don’t know how much difference that’s really making.  To be fair, I’m also just a little frustrated with my coffee in general.  I know many here find pleasure in dialing it in and in the process of making coffee, I on the other hand am sick of messing with it.  I have a chemex, an aeropress, a French press, a pour over, a Nespresso (I know that doesn’t really count) and am pretty regularly finding my coffee ‘meh’.  I have an encore that I mess with the settings with a bit, I try different beans and whatever else but, truth be told, I probably like the cup from Waffle House out of that huge Bunn brewer as well if not better.  I’m at a point of just tell me what pre-ground coffee is most mainstream ‘diner’ style, I’ll put it in my moccamaster the night before, use a smart plug, and take what I get.  One last note, I do use distilled water, I’ve considered adding those coffee minerals to it but haven’t yet.  Many say it makes a big difference but in my experience, most of the things I’ve tried that others say works, doesn’t for me.  And lastly, I’m not dogging the machine, I love it, it’s just not a panacea.

Guy in the truck was at the ordering box (which he can clearly see me from). He looked down to check his phone while approaching the window and looked up and thought I had drove off. Which resulted in him crashing into me while the lady was handing me my coffee. It cracked my rear bumper and dented my trunk a bit. I couldn’t drive it anymore because it was raining a lot where I’m from and I didn’t want any water damage. She stayed in the garage for 2 weeks before her appointment at the collision center. Got her back the 19th of December. 
I decided to go for a drive down to LA to visit some friends for pre-Christmas. I drove down December 21st and was supposed to drive back the 23rd. On the 23rd I was waiting at a red light, busy intersection quite a bit of traffic. We were all waiting at the light when all of a sudden I hear a very familiar crunch sound… another truck had rear ended me. But this time he didn’t stop there, he kept gassing it and I kept braking, honking, and revving trying to get him to stop. That’s when he rams me into the car in front of me and starts to sandwich me a bit. Someone else got out of their car to tell him to stop which he does. Long story short he was not licensed and he didn’t have insurance. 🙃 So Happy Holidays to me I guess. I’m hoping everything is able to get fixed.

I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years in October, after she lost it in the car and shouted repeatedly about how she wasn't sure she was in love with me. I was devastated. I loved her madly, I would have married her. After 3 years I had been pushing to move in, but she always got cold feet the second our planning got serious. From her telling, she's dealing with a lot of personal things including depression and OCD and needed space to deal with them in a productive way.

My friends were mostly her friends first, and they all (with one lovely exception who I am very grateful for) went with her when we broke up. I am still in touch but it is definitely an arm's-length affair. I am not close to my family, there's a lot of emotional abuse and toxicity there-- including homophobia, among other things-- that I don't need in my life, so I haven't really reached out to them. I have been very alone.

The isolation was earth-shattering and at times all-encompassing. But I soldiered on and after about 5 weeks, I put myself out there on dating apps. After just a couple of days I matched with a teacher who wanted to meet up for coffee. We hit it off immediately. Our second date ended with a steamy makeout session in a parking lot.

On our third she took me to a friend's birthday party where we talked and danced and then we had great sex. We planned to go on another date but then she invited me over for dinner before that, which of course ended with more great sex. We lingered together the next day for as long as we could. We talked about meeting her kid after Christmas.

I messaged my ex about her, because we were still in the same social groups and figured it would be nicer to hear it from me than from gossip. Besides, I was hoping we would stay friends. Then the next day I posted something on a shared discord about a fun date thing I did, and my ex's sister, ostensibly a very good friend of mine, lost her shit.

She accused me of doing it to get revenge, guilt tripped me about their mother's illness, and just generally berated me for being insensitive. I didn't take it lying down, and she ended up apologizing, but it still didn't feel great. It just confirmed how I had been feeling, that to my friends I was only her ex.

Then, the next day: the day before Christmas eve, my new girl broke it off with me via text. She said she ""had fun,"" was ""glad to have met,"" and that I was ""very sweet,"" but she was ""looking for a different kind of connection."" I asked if I had done something, and she insisted that no: she just needed someone who had ""more community in common"" with her. I was completely blind-sided.

In spite of us only knowing each other for like a month, this somehow hurt almost as much as losing my girlfriend of 3 years. I guess maybe because it stirs up a lot of that too. I have had racing thoughts about it all day today, wondering what I could have done differently. The insecurities and toxic self-talk are completely overwhelming. I feel desperately unloveable. I feel worthless.

Please do not respond with ""you just need to keep your head up"" or to ""just keep putting yourself out there."" Believe me when I say, I am and have been trying so hard to do that. I am going through the motions of engaging on dating apps and making plans to socialize even today. But sitting in this complex and overwhelming heartbreak is just so hard to do alone. It's not enough to cry about it. I want to scream. I want to break something. I have to hold myself back from sending angry texts to so many people.

I just want to know why mostly. And I know the real answer is, ""it doesn't matter,"" but it does. I would just like to know if she couldn't relate to my hobbies or was turned off by how little I know about current events or play video games, didn't have a car or couldn't relate to her experience as a single mother. Or maybe she just met somebody else. Any of these would have given me more closure than ""I'm looking for someone who shares more community."" No one knows what that means, it's clearly just a sterilized way to not say something rude. Well I'd rather know exactly because no truth can be as bad as what I can't stop telling myself right now.

That is all. That is the sum of the things that are making me feel like I can't get out of bed right now. I just want someone else to know about it too, so if you read to the end: thank you, I super appreciate you.",4,1735420328.0,AskLesbians,1,0.83,False

So, a little back story. My husband doesn’t like leaving the house or spending money at all. I get it but this means we go on vacation without him. He also has a habit of agreeing to plans, then will conveniently take a nap before hand to get out of going. He will either get up from the nap, be a miserable jerk and complain the whole time (sometimes drive like maniac bc he’s mad I made him go) or he will refuse to get up. Anyways, Christmas Day. We’re supposed to go to his family’s house then my family. He decided to take a nap 1 hour before we go claiming that he is sick. He has no symptoms at all. He seems completely normal. Takes nothing for it and begrudgingly goes to Christmas. Here’s where I’m sure I’m TA. I told his to get up and stop pretending to be sick. I said if you’re planning on going to work, then you better go to Christmas. I’m tired of this. He gets up and goes and complains about going. Still claiming to be sick. No cough, no runny nose. No specific complaints about the sickness, just sick. He went to work the two days after with no problems. 2 hour drive each way. I’m now sick. I was around a family member a week prior that was clearly sick and I have the same symptoms. (He was not around this family member or anyone really bc he was laid off for two months prior to the week of Christmas.) I have a cough, chills, body aches, my head and neck hurt. I feel dizzy when I walk so only got up to shower. I asked him to make me a coffee. He refused and told me to stop pretending. He said he’d make me chicken broth, then decided to take a nap instead. AITA? I mean, if he really seemed sick, I obviously would have gone without him on Christmas. My daughter and I really believe he was trying to get out of it because that’s what he does. Also, important to note that he drinks whiskey every day and a friend pointed out to me that that’s why he doesn’t want to go anywhere. I’m not entirely sure how much he is drinking because once I brought it up to him, he started being sneakier about it. I think a bottle might last 1 or 2 weeks.",8,1735420284.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1hofex9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1hofex9/update/,update ,"i did not go through with my attempt months ago because my mother nearly died from alcohol abuse so i had to try to help her for a bit, she ended up in an institution for a few days and then lived with my aunt from july to november.
in the months i lived here alone she only came by to bring food and stuff, it was quiet, and my nox pain actually went away and my tinnitus improved, only proving certain users were right.
since my mom and sister have come home i stay in my room again, i have had to deal with returning nox pain on a few occasions since and and struggling as i have to be around them as little as possible but my mom still makes me do things around the apartment that are loud at times. it feels like i am trying to avoid a relapse in worsening symptoms at all times and it is exhausting.
i saw my psychiatrist recently and got help getting on the waiting list for social security because i can't work. my middle ear myoclonus or ttps(?) which started with ear rumbling when touching my left cheek and developed into ear rumbling just from things going near the left side of my face has remained, but a couple days ago it started in my right ear, when touching my right cheek, my face is tingling somewhat now because i am pretty focused on that as it is scaring me, will try to talk to my mom about it to try to get a pass to be around noise even less, unfortunately could be up to 2 years before i can get on social security, and i don't know how to get my own apartment because we are poor. the ear rumbling is one of my main concerns right now as everything else was already a concern before, i don't know if anyone has advice on that myoclonus/type stuff but that'd be appreciated, i still have suicidal thoughts when my symptoms in general worsen, when the pain comes back mostly, and it does get hard to sleep, i think decaffeinated coffee doesn't seem to exacerbate anything as far as i've noticed the last few months. i still avoid meds unless absolutely necessary and avoid triggers like artificial sweeteners. i still will not promise that i will make it through this year because obviously this stuff can get bad quickly, but i will try to develop a better support system with my family, they actually set up a quiet room for me to stay over on thanksgiving so that was at least a step. 
i recommend silence for sure, it proved beneficial, even if i end up back at a horrible place and possibly dead from this stuff, i do recommend that.
apologies for the concern, not that you should be relieved for me or anything, as like i said i still live in fear, especially now, but yeah, that's that. might make one or two more posts about specific things, so no, not doing good right now, but yes, can testify silence helps, even if you do have to continue staying in silence because the symptoms can return quickly after you try to return to a normal life.

Does anyone have a friendship tank like this and get back to beeing friends again later? Or maybe you're in a similar or opposite position and want to vent?

Obligatory sorry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language. Also, I'm reading this back. Sorry for the long post. 

My (f34) friend (f34) got pregnant at the same time as me when I misscarried my fourth pregnancy (no living children). It was her second month ttc. She told me a week after my miscarriage (which she knew about, she also knew we had been ttc for over 2 years). 

I imideatly stopped sharing news about the misscarriege and grief (who wants to hear about that when you're first pregnant). I told her I was happy for her, and it would be hard for me, and I needed some time processing. A week later, I reached out saying that I had trouble beeing happy for her and that it wasn't personal, I was depressed and not happy about anything, but I wished her a smooth, unaventful pregnancy. And if she wanted, we could take up contact again, but I might be a bit moody. 

She told me she would think about it, and a week later said she we could do it, but wanted to know my boundaries. We agreed upon that pregnancy was not off topic but would not be all the time. And that I did not want to see her ultrasound when she did that. Same with my misscarriges. We had a tenaous back and forth texting and agreed to meet for coffee yesterday.

It became quite clear early that she was in a baby bubble. I talked along with her because I did want to know that she was okay and what was happening in her life. But I quicly realised that every aspect of her life was about her pregnancy. Which I get, it is an exciting and big thing. The thing is, it didn't stop with her pregnancy. She managed to mention both of her two other friends' babies and how much she wanted to be around them all the time. And that she was salty that her cousin had gotten pregnant so soon after here, ""now she only got 3 months in the spotlight""

I brought up other topics, but everything circled back to how that was affected by her pregnancy. Of the 10 topics I remember she brought up, 3 were solely about her or her cousins pregnancy, 5 were about other stuff but ended up avout how that aspect of her life now was changed because of the pregnancy, 2 were about something nonrelated to pregnancy or babies. I estimate 60-75% of the total time was about her pregnancy in some way or another, but I admit I'm a little extra sensitive about this topic now. 

After an hour of this, she turned to me and asked me something along the lines of ""Have the doctors found out what's wrong with you yet?"" This is not a direct quote because my brain blacked out. I can not for the life of me remember the end of the sentence. I quickly said that ""they have found nothing wrong, and that I could not talk about it now."" Luckily, she changed the topic, but I needed to leave. She asked if I wanted her to come with or not, and I said that was up to her, but I needed to get out. She joined me and said she was sorry she had triggered me. She just wanted to show her concern. Then imideatly started talking about how they now had to get a car... because there were a lot of things that needed to be fixed before the baby got here, and in the end, she would not be able to move much. 

I was just dumbfounded by the lack of empathy. This is one of my oldest friends, who knows I have struggled a lot this fall after 3 misscarriges in 7 months. I was tempted to just ghoost her, but opted for the mature thing and used a day to craft a non acusatory message, saying I was hurt she would bring up other peoples babies and pregnancyes, and how hard it hit me that after that she would basicly ask me if they knew what was wrong with me. And that I needed more thoughtfulness in the conversations going forward. 

Two hours later, I got a message that could be summed up to sorry you were hurt, I moderated myself a lot. If I can not talk about such a big part of my life, we need a break until you have had more time to process your emotions.

Mind you, we talk maybe once a month, and only see each other 4-5 times a year, but God forbid it if she can not talk about the pregnancy for 90 minutes. 

I'm just so disappointed about the lack of empathy. It's not like she doesn't have other people to talk to about this stuff. She was even seeng two other people later the same day, one of them with kids. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading. 

TLTR: My unicorn friend who knows about my 2 year ttc and 4 mc's got pregnant and needs a break so that I can get over my problems with her bringing up random peoples pregnancyes and babies.

Now l say again cos at the beginning of our relationship he started talking to her and told me he was going to meet up with her but l wasn’t going.  I said to him if you go that’s ok but l won’t be here when you return.  He didn’t go.  Now 14 years on he reconnected and lm sitting there and once again l spoke but he couldn’t even hear me.  I said something about talking to her again and he was saying they are friends and lm being stupid!  Ok so l went to bed but l was sick l have intestinal failure associated liver disease so l have a feeding tube and feed at night but because l felt so sick l didn’t do my feed.  Anyways 10 minutes later l was so nauseous l got out of bed and here he is playing at his crotch area with my coffee cup in hand….l was like you AH he wont or reckons he can’t get an erection so we haven’t had sex for over 4.5 years.  I went to the toilet vomited stewed on this and l was so hurt.  Anyway l came out and said we don’t have sex but you talk with an ex for an hour and your out here having a flog over it and in my coffee cup!  He protested saying he wasn’t flogging he was pissing in my coffee cup!  The toilet being 10 steps away saying he wasn’t flogging busting so he peed in my cup… by now l am thinking l didn’t know what was worse!  Il was like wtf!? He said he’s only done it a few times in my cup!  Now l was really more pissed off than lve been in my whole life!  I said what’d you do with my cup?! He said he rinsed it and put it back on the sink for me?!  This is my favourite cup!?  He doesn’t get why lm so upset but he turned it around saying that l vomit in the toilet and it’s yuk but l clean it every time! So basically he didn’t care.  He continues talking to her. Then he says Trudy said you don’t have to be jealous and to let you read my messages.  I said that’s stupid cos he deleted msgs and l knew he would have. So, last night l got his phone and read these msgs.  Totally dis jointed conversation with msgs removed obviously.  He left a mesh where she gave him her phone number to ring as it was easier.  He apparently said no because l was asleep on the couch and he told me told her l was the jealous type.  But he’d deleted all that part too but he rang her the next day while he was supposed to be shopping.  He lied and said he only chatted for 5 minutes which was also a lie it was 15.  
We just put an offer on a house to buy.  But l don’t know if l can go ahead.  
He said he knew ld be pissed that’s why he didn’t tell me!  But l feel destroyed by all of this. I have no where to go and no money to do it.  What the bejeebers am l doing? He even said why were you going through my phone?!  When his Dad passed away with the will and everything.. my partners brother is buying us out but our new home everything rests on his brother paying my partner out. From the beginning l was telling them what they needed to do but they wanted to do everything dodgy so told me it was none of my business.  As it was his father.  I’ve put myself down for a house loan with him but because l said your brother has to hurry up he told me again it was none of my business.  It’s not but the house part kinda is.  
He always changes it up and it turns out to be my fault like this time!  He wouldn’t have been so secretive but told me it was because ld act the way l am.. he says jealousy l say nothing to do  with it, it’s how he has lied about it and how he must really think of me.. l don’t think he does very much to do this to me.

Some backstory:
Our household consists of me (M26), my sister (F24) and our mother (F58). 
We have a live in maid (F60) that we’ll call M, with the following agreement:
* She lives in a flat on our property, rent free
* The flat is big enough that she can have any family members come stay with her at any time, also rent free (her sister has been living with her in the flat for almost 2 years. Her sisters kid also often comes to stay here for free)
* She gets 2 square meals every day Monday to Friday (my mom just fixes extra plates), however she also eats with us most weekends
* We also stock her with essentials when we go on vacation each year. About N$2,500 worth of food (which is about what I spend on my groceries a month)
* We also provide her with ‘basics’ daily. This basically just means she can come into our home and get whatever she needs from the fridge or cupboards (in other words she doesn’t pay for bread, milk, coffee, sugar, cheese, cold meats, maize… That type of stuff)
* She gets a 13th paycheck every year, regardless of how we are doing financially

The above arrangement comes with one condition: We live in a remote area with a high rate of non violent crimes (mostly break ins when nobody is home).
Twice we have been on vacation when M has also been on leave, and they broke into our home. We have in the meantime gotten bigger dogs, as well as for the last 8 years we have had an agreement with M that when we go on vacation she stays in our home. When we are home she gets to use her leave as she sees fit. This normally means we are gone over late December, and then she takes either November, early December or Januarie off.
Ever since this agreement we haven’t had incident.
For the last two years she has declined to go on vacation as she is looking after her sister who is sick.
On the 2nd of December she came to my mother and asked her if she could go on vacation. My mom said that she was more than welcome as she hasn’t taken leave in the last two years (we even paid her bonus a month early so she could use it while on leave) but asked that she please be back on the 26th of Dec, as we wanted to leave for vacation on the 27th in order to be back by the 4th of Jan (me and my sister start working on the 6th of Jan).
M said it would not be a problem, and that she would be back, however she didn’t leave until the 17th. As of now (the 28th) she has not come back, nor has she answered our calls or text messages. We only got a text message from her son saying she’ll be back by the 3rd, and that we quote “had to deal with it.” As of now my mom and sister left for the vacation as all the arrangements had been made and it doesn’t make sense for the three of us to be miserable. I stayed behind to look after the animals and the house. I’m just kinda irked. M is literally part of the family, she has worked for my parents for the last 17 years and we’ve always had a really good relationship… Which makes this situation even more difficult as we are her employer (me and my mom contribute to her salary) and don’t really know how to handle this.",3,1735418735.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1hoeuec,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hoeuec/i_27m_am_experiecing_continued_difficulties_with/,"I (27M) am experiecing continued difficulties with my coworker (38M), I am seeking mitigation and de-escalation strategies to handle our interactions.","I have a coworker, who let us call (Ben) who has been a tumultuous character in the past year of his employment. I work in our Engineering Department and he works in our Documentation Control Department, I'm a 2nd generation immigrant, and he's first generation, same ethnicity.

He has to my face insulted me multiple times for simply asking him leading questions, or asking him to explain contradictions, or simply correcting him on his usage of certain terminology..

Originally, i had met him some months ago and he spoke about how he was a photographer and journalist for a well-regarded tech magazine overseas and worked as a model photographer. He showed me pictures of expos and trade shows in Singapore, New York, Chicago, Detroit, LA, etc. And large portfolios of his work with Gravure models. I visited his home and saw a bevy of technical tools and viable home workshops.

On one of our first ""projects"" together he also invited me for a gig where we laid Ethernet for a large Estate across 4 buildings and worked from sunrise to sunset for about 2 weeks. He also shared a passion for firearms, drones, history, sociology, camping, off-roading, gastronomy, and political intrigue. But he also had a brain tumor and admitted to anger issues in the past which lead to court-ordered counseling. He used to be a gang-banger, was fatherless and was so for many years.

I was convinced then, that this seems like an interesting man and one who is driven and has turned his life around. But I often have petty squabbles with the man.

>Example 1

>Muslim or Mexican:

>Myself: ""Is XXXX Muslim? I often see him praying towards the east and speaking in what sounds like Farsi. However the strange thing is that he does it in the bathroom while we're some of us are doing #2, shouldn't we have a room available for him?""

>Ben: ""He's.. Mexican..""

>Myself: ""..A Muslim is a follower of Islam, it's not an ethnic group like Jewish people who can also be non-practising.""

>Ben: ""I'm pretty sure he's Mexican""

>Myself: ""Okay maybe I'm not being clear, is he Islamic?""

>Ben: ""You're not listening to me! He is f\*cking Mexican!""

>Example 2:

>Non-Profit Companies and APIs:

>Myself: People are complaining about Op\*nAI in my groups online for the singularity topic, they've been saying the API keys (4$/Million tokens) are too expensive for the projects they've been working on.

>Ben: OpenAI is a nonprofit company, API keys shouldn't cost anything.

>Myself: Yeah they don't cost anything to get, but they don't work without a balance on your account because they still need money to maintain servers and pay the property tax or lease contract on their buildings, and the people they hire need a source of income. Lots of nonprofits collapse because they don't have a trust and lose the donation stream needed for overhead.

>Ben: Do you even f\*cking know how API's work? All those people you're listening to online are wrong.

>Myself: Ben, these people are associate professors or run their own BioComputation labs and regularly write Academic papers, you should seriously try talking in that group I sent you on Discord, I see your name in the members list and i know you love listening to technology podcasts and trying generative AI services. Seriously, just give it a try, folks there have a lot to teach us.

>Ben: They're lying to you, who will you listen to? Me or them?

>Myself: You've literally seen the stacks of books on my shelf, on Data Science and Data Engineering, and you know im taking a course on it right now, I'm pretty sure they're all correct.

>Ben: ""...""

So.. generally this type of rejection is what cuts off most of my conversations with him regarding things because he's willing to warp the definitions or words to suit his initial stance and never admits to being incorrect. We don't apologize to each other.. but we do get coffee or pay for each other's lunch and its kind've implicative in Asian culture as I understand to not directly apologize in order to save face but instead confer benefits or speak well of them later to ""fix"" the scales of karma.

As a straightforward person of Catholic background and work.. this has taken some.. getting used to.

I was later teaching him design engineering principles a year ago for mechanical design but he often celebrated any idea he had with some rather.. strange self-affirmations.

Ben: ""I thought you were smart, why didn't you think of this, you spent 8 years learning? Maybe im more suited for this than you"".

I wasn't really insulted, I was excited because out of 10 different technicians, we finally had someone who was interested in this instead of getting up and disappearing for 2-3 hours or going outside to hit their vapes and use Facebook messenger. I did have to pop his bubble with...

Myself: ""The CTO and I considered that idea three weeks ago, you can see the original design sketch and our notes on testing \*here.\*"" \*Hands him a sketchbook\*. ""this is what we arrived at after 4 more design iterations and testing."" ""It's just that when I suggest certain things like.. think of how you can stabilize this, it's a leading question to get you to imagine and when I describe certain things, our mental images will not be the same if we only talk about the goal but not the process of how the tool goes about completing it. Kind've like how there are 10 or 11 different pliers on that bench over there but all they do is pinch. ""

Really, my father is quite similar, assured by a strong sense of bravado and willing to try anything once or twice. But the self-affirmations and bullishness is rather.. wasteful in a professional setting and I've see it start conflicts with other people.

Static Vs Kinetic Vs Rolling Friction.. Materials science properties, optics and photography, case studies.. it's evident we both love the topics but eventually he stopped trying to have any technical conversations with me because of interactions like the above.. because he begins doubling down. This.. appears to be common amongst 1st generation immigrants and I believe it may have to do with their arrested education, but to be honest I've faced similar stances in my peers during my time in the US Public Education system and im not sure what to think, perhaps im just seeking a generational trend to remove him of personal accountability.

Maybe im the weird one? Peers often criticized me for being ""too straight"", for ""thinking im better than everyone"", for ""Thinking its so easy"" when quite literally i’m explaining how one builds up the skill-set for a task or what resources exist then or now and what prior people had done historically, or even what sacrifices need to be made and what causes some people to lag behind due to privilege, stable environments or simply opportunity. But then again, i’m told by my teachers, mentors and therapists; that people don’t normally think like that.

So, I spent some time asking people.. What is their thinking or rationale? What cognitive techniques have they used and employed throughout the years? How do they justify information? And often people just get up and walk away.Or they directly go to another peer.

From colleagues: “I hate this man!” “I feel like he sees right through me!” “He always thinks he smarter than me!” “he’s like a dark cloud over me!”

From family: “He’s too smart!” “He’s obviously autistic or something” “he’s not like us, he’s an American, he’s not Vietnamese like us” “Of course he’s different, he’s an Engineer!”.

From my students: “Don’t worry Mr. V, you’ll find friends someday.”

*Man it really stings when even the kids are pitying me but its low-key funny too.*

In my understanding, my coworker knows enough general knowledge to have a cocktail or interview conversation but not enough to actually work directly with persons in the field but lately i've been hearing him slander my character without telling people what actually occurs or even seeking their validation for his emotions. He just taps on their shoulders, tell the story, omits a large majority, makes an insulting joke about: Their sexuality, their virility, their attractiveness, or their trustworthiness.

Often he's jokingly slandered my character as being too white or too technical when its us two, but if he engaged like the above with me for certain people, he would refuse an explanation for said person's behaviour based on.. incentive, prior background, known coping strategies; and double down on character assassination.

But he also admits to outright hiring people to help him cheat on prior exams or class courses, which i believe has built an excellent.. project management mindset but not one suited for hands-on situations which may involved emotional labour or accountability considerations.

A few disconcerting moments were where I literally watched him use ChatGPT to finish his history courses online for his degree and outright disagree with the outputs it gives for not contradicting his beliefs, but the wastefulness of the class itself because he did not see or could argue for any value in understanding Lincoln or the politics of the reconstruction.. but merely the important fact being he won the US civil war.

Or he seeked me out to file a complaint against our Quality/Engineering Manager for discrimination... when said man had reprimanded him for trying to sell foodstuffs on a production floor room with a FOD warning for electronics.. while tugging cooler of said food... on a day where we have clients visiting us. And I had to explain what discrimination based on gender or identity actually meant and how.. Said person might be an asshole but they're correct. He screamed ""i thought you were my friend! You traitor! I'll fight you right now! come here!""

Overall, as a friend he is.. tolerable and wide in his knowledge and experiences and somewhat fun to talk to.. but as a coworker or mentee, he can be troublesome to deal with, and often refuses to do his work or passes it off to someone who then.. also passes it off.

I would be open to say, that sometimes he enjoys maliciously manipulating people and outright says he “doesn’t come to work for the money but the drama”, but quite often outside of work, he asks me for money or simply fails to pay me back at all, or he relegates himself to only talking about “is this possible” questions instead of ever reciprocating my question of cultural practices in Vietnam or social management. I manage my money quite well, as I would like to think, and often encourage him to begin investing for the sake of his wife and child because i honestly sympathize with his difficulties and ability to admit the need for help than the fact he might forget to pay me back.

Often he regales others and I with his ability to be friends with anyone.. despite bragging about losing friends after posting MAGA pictures online and “winning” conflicts by threatening legal action, or outright physical altercations (“Reserved” parking spot issue with personnel) for simply being insulted, which is honestly quite common in my current firm.

Recently, he's been ignoring my texts and offers to hang out anymore but he'll take the initiative to call me and complain about.. me, other people, and hang up before i even get the chance to reply or assuage him of his worries. I'm not sure if i've hit the limits of the tools available to me socially and in Asian culture or his brain tumour is getting bigger again and he may be becoming irritable because of such.

If any of you have similar experiences in dealing with similar people, please explain to me what actions and circumstances you've found to best get along with them, or even send me doubts of my narration (unreliable narrator) so i may fill in any gaps you might see or oversights in my own behavior.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hoesda,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1hoesda/cosmetic_smile_makeover_advice_poor_childhood/,Cosmetic smile makeover advice (poor childhood hygiene correction),"I'm a 27M living in Colorado who recently finished putting myself through college, so now I'm looking to use my extra income to get my smile back in order so I can feel more confident on the dating scene and in my professional life. I'm just looking for advice on where to start. Is it possible for me to use a clear-aligner treatment like Invisalign, or am I limited to traditional braces? Can the distinct stains be removed/blended & teeth whitened, or should I just plan on getting crowns or veneers? Assuming cost is no issue, in what time frame can I *realistically* expect to have a mostly-corrected smile? How much money could I be looking at for these treatments?

**Backstory:** I had braces from ages 14-17. My orthodontist abruptly passed away (and his office closed immediately) prior to completion of my treatment, and my family couldn't afford to switch to any of the orthodontists in our area so they just had the braces removed as-is. I also never got a retainer after removal because of this. As such, despite my smile being in significantly better shape than prior to the braces, my teeth have drifted quite noticeably. My upper midline is off-center, crowded lower front teeth, various gaps & crooked teeth throughout the mouth. Additionally, my wisdom teeth came in after braces (all 4 removed at age 20) which further contributed to my smile shifting.

For most of the duration of my braces, I heavily smoked cigarettes/cannabis, drank black coffee daily, consumed lots of soda & candy, etc. My parents also never taught me adequate oral hygiene, so I usually brushed superficially for maybe 30sec each morning and would sometimes even go days without brushing. Because of these habits, my teeth are stained quite yellow and there are numerous brown spots around where the braces brackets were. Keep in mind also that my front tooth was broken in half at age 11 and restored with a composite buildup - the fracture line is highlighted by the buildup of brown staining. Had a couple cavitites filled around this seam over the years.

Fast forward a few years, I've since quit all smoking, stopped drinking coffee and soda, and cut back on sugar intake. I lived with a partner for several years who was a dental hygienist, and they educated me SO much on proper oral hygiene habits to prevent further damage to my teeth. Twice daily, I use an electric toothbrush (Oral-B iO Series 7) w/ fluoride toothpaste, floss after every meal, and alcohol-free rinse before bed. I've gotten several cavities filled but have been without health insurance for the past years (student), so I've unfortunately not been back for a cleaning/exam in a while.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

My toddler (18mo) has started getting up at 5:30am wide awake, which has been going on for a while and nothing seems to fix it. It seems like he is an early riser, which is fine (but annoying). I’m after sleep advice for myself and figured this would be the best place to ask. My natural rhythm, when I don’t have an alarm or responsibilities, is about 10:30pm-7am. Is there any way to shift that back so be more like 9pm-5-5:30am? 


Even on days where I’m up and about at 5am, I find it really hard to fall asleep before 10pm. I don’t use my phone in bed, I don’t use my bed during the day for laying around, wind down before bed mentally and physically by doing things like folding washing or spending time with my husband, exercise during the day, don’t drink coffee or tea past 11am (and only 1 cup, sometimes 2, per day), use magnesium before bed. If I go to bed early, I end up getting really poor quality sleep and not being able to fall asleep for ages.  

Is there any way to try to shift my routine to sleep and rise earlier? My husband is even later than me in his natural rhythm and is going to start a new job in a couple of months, so I’ll be asking him to do less morning wakes so he can be more rested for his new job (mine’s cruisy).

Would they want someone who may be a language teacher? How is the job market there?)

Hi all, I have been reading up information / sharing on this sub as well as the housing market around North Bay and am curious about how one would feel living here with some details, if I may. 

I read many good things from threads like this:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/1hlcrrl/moving\_to\_north\_bay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/northbay/comments/1hlcrrl/moving_to_north_bay/)

I knew about North Bay in a job fair in North York, Toronto. The job fair did not help me land a job, but the lady at the booth advertising about North Bay gave me some insights about the pros and cons about the city which piqued my interest in the long run. I have 4 core questions:

1. Would you think it is the place for me if I want to live a peaceful life enjoying coffee / gaming at home / cycling on a road bike around / going to the theater for musicals or shows every now and then?

2. How is everything with the mailing / parcel delivery system, does it often delay? Asking because I shop from Amazon quite often, if not all the time

3. Do people in / from North Bay welcome outsiders?

4. Given the current economic situation around Canada, are there job opportunities for a newcomer with limited Canadian experience (I started my first Canadian job since late-November 2024)?

My background:   
\- from Hong Kong, and figured that urban-cyberpunk vibe just isn't for me, no matter how dazzling and glamorous the city definitely is;

I am settling in Toronto at the moment and am on track to survive with income from my part-time remote job (which is a business taking the initiative to expand its business in Canada) and the part-time job as a server here. I am grateful for what I have, hell I can even save money for investing while renting a room in Toronto, while having an emergency fund readily available. 

The thing is, I cannot see Toronto as a final destination for permanent settlement, but a connecting hub to transfer to somewhere else. I understand that every country / city / town has its problems, and some are just the universal case for the entirety of Ontario as I read - drugs, homelessness and such. Also mayflies being a specific problem to the area. 

How I look at it is the proximity to nature and general peacefulness, and the photos I saw on the booth and the printed materials seem to be just too good to miss, if not 'The one for me'. They look like scenes I saw when I was in Sydney, Australia. Here is the booklet I got (which I have been re-reading about):

Wanted to ask you pros a question about browsing. I always have my vehicle serviced at the dealership where I purchased it. I am kind of a car person and enjoy just looking at cars, reading the stickers, etc. So when I'm having my car serviced, I usually spend some time in the lot doing just those things. Every time I do this while having my car serviced, I am approached by a salesperson. I'm always very upfront with them and usually say something like ""Just here to get my car serviced, killing time, just like cars, not at all in the market. Don't want to waste your time.""

The first time, the salesperson was great and was just like, ""Understood, just let me know if you have any questions"" and left me alone. But recently, the salespeople will not leave me alone and will push/try to figure out objections, try to get me over them, get me a quote on the car, etc. My most recent service, I just left to go get a coffee somwhere. 

I guess my question is there any good way to let them know that I really \*truly\* am not interested in purchasing and don't want to waste their time while my vehicle is being serviced, apart from what I currently do? I do miss looking around the lot! Haha.",5,1735417988.0,askcarsales,4,1.0,False

I am writing here because I don't know who to turn to, maybe you could give me some advice.

I am a 33 year old female, and just recently started using dating apps. Around two months ago I matched with a guy.  I will try to keep it short. We met for dinner, had a great time. I liked him, but I thought he didn't reciprocate ( later, i found out he thought the same). Fast forward two months later, when he was back in town ( he visits the city once a month for work), we went out for dinner again. This time, rather just partying ways after dinner, we went for a walk to the Christmas market. 

We had a ride on the ferris wheel and we kissed, and he was holding me the whole time. We both confessed that we like each other since first time we met, however we both had the impression the other person didn't.  That night we stayed together, watching anime, talking and getting to know each other more. 

The next morning we had breakfast, stayed together a bit longer, walked around and we decided to get to see where it goes. He was leaving the next day, still he asked to get some coffee in the morning before leaving. At this point I was sure I really liked him and he really liked me. So the next morning before parting, we decided we will be in touch, and meet again next time he was in town ( which would be in a month or so). For the next two weeks we kept in touch and chitchatted almost every day. I think this is where I messed up. Before leaving he had mentioned something along the lines of "" his past relationships had messed him up, and he never actually got attention from his ex, it was mostly psychological abuse from her"". I thought it would be cute to text him "" good morning"", as a sign of ' hey I wish you a good day, and I want to make an effort cos I like you"". I had asked him before if that was ok, and he said it was actually cute. So I would hit him with some text randomly, either sharing a funny situation, or the first snow, or just random stuff. We also decided to have a virtual date once a week (I'm mentioning this, as when we had coffee, he was the one who suggested we could play some game, like LOL, so we could have some fun activity together). One day, around two weeks later, I asked if we were still on for that week's virtual date, and he confirmed. 5 min later he texted saying that he doesn't like the idea of a weekly call, as it feels something you would do in a relationship. He also said that things seem to be going in different directions as he is more of a 'collect-data-first' kind of person, whereas I seem to be setting for a long term relationship. I was so taken aback. and I couldn't think of anything. I can;t even remember what I said exactly, but I realized no matter what I said, he had decided to end things ( whatever the thing we had was). I thanked him for his honesty and wished him the best and that was it.

It has been a little more than month and I still cannot get over what happened. I hate to admit it, but I still like him and I feel I blew things by texting him that often, as I might have overwhelmed him, although my intention was to simply show that I was willing to make an effort. Is there any change I could fix things, and if yes, what should I do?

Fast-forward to adulthood, and her quirkiness has escalated into full-blown obsession with haunted dolls.



Jessica now owns over 30 of these “spirited” dolls, which she insists are occupied by the souls of the departed. She gives them names, hosts “tea parties” for them, and even dedicates Instagram posts to them with captions like, “Evelyn is feeling mischievous today!” (Yes, Evelyn is one of her dolls.)



Whenever family gatherings roll around, Jessica always complains that no one ever wants to visit her house. She claims it’s because her place is “too far away” (it’s a 20-minute drive) or that people are just “jealous” of her unique lifestyle. But the truth? Her house is downright terrifying.



The walls are covered in Victorian-style wallpaper she put up to “match the vibe” of the dolls. Dim lighting, creepy porcelain faces staring at you from every shelf, and Jessica talking to them like they’re her roommates—it’s like stepping into a low-budget horror film.



At Christmas, Jessica started her usual rant about how no one comes to visit her or respects her “spiritual practice.” She said she feels isolated and unsupported, especially because “society just doesn’t understand empaths.”



I finally had enough and said, “Jessica, no one visits you because your house looks like a shrine to nightmare fuel. It’s not ‘society,’ it’s *you.* No one wants to be stared down by haunted dolls while drinking coffee.”



She gasped like I’d just slapped her, and my mom hissed, “Not the time, dear.” But my uncle snorted into his eggnog, and my younger cousin whispered, “Finally, someone said it.”



Jessica stormed off, and later that night, she posted a vague Facebook status about how “some people can’t handle women embracing their divine femininity through spiritual connections.” She also uploaded a TikTok of her holding one of the dolls, tearfully declaring, “They might not love you, Evelyn, but I do.”



I’ve since been labeled “the family villain,” but honestly? I’m not sorry. She’s been tagging me in passive-aggressive memes about “toxic relatives” for days now. My mom says I should apologize to “keep the peace,” but my dad says, “Eh, maybe she needed to hear it.”

[acne],"i've struggled with cystic hormonal acne regularly every month since i was about 20 (now im 24). only around my mouth. i had started replacing my morning coffee with a large spearmint tea (3 bags of the Handpick brand, it's amazon's choice) and it basically eradicated my acne and got me to a point where the scars had begun fading.

i stopped taking it for 2 weeks this past summer and the acne has been back ever since. i've been taking 3 capsules of the Swanson full spectrum spearmint capsules daily and they seem to help somewhat, but i still have recurring pimples. im confused because i had seen many people claiming the capsule form was more effective than the tea for them and im wondering if there's any concrete evidence to support that? i figured the capsules would be more convenient but did some research and apparently in tea form the compounds in the herbs are more easily absorbed into the bloodstream. so maybe it's more effective to drink it in tea form after all? has anyone had this experience?

I have a couple other questions as well:

1. is there is a best time to take it? personally i haven't been able to notice whether or not it makes a difference when i take it in the morning/ night or taking half a dose in the morning and half at night
2. how many mg do you suggest taking? right now i take three 400mg capsules so 1200mg daily. is this not enough or too much? i read that I should be only taking 900mg
3. is spearmint just a topical solution to a deeper problem? does it lose effectiveness over time or will I develop a tolerance? i eat healthy, stay hydrated, workout, wash my face and moisturize daily so I know for sure that the acne is hormonal, and I really don't want to go on birth control to manage it :/ i don't want to open up a new can of worms and i already have a nonhormonal iud",6,1735417395.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False

We tried to run. 

Morning, July 8th, I climbed out of my bedroom window. 

My math teacher was waiting for me, sipping freshly brewed coffee. 

“Busted.” I muttered into my talkie. 

“They got you guys too?” Nick yelled back. I could hear him struggling. “Ow, you don't have to tie them so tight! I'm not an animal–”

I had an audience when I was cuffed and shoved onto the bus. 

“It's not *that* serious,” I told the crowd of kids, trying to hide my bound wrists. 

The bus ride was uncomfortable with my hands tied behind my back. Next to me, Nick was snoozing on the window, Bobby's head buried in my shoulder. 

The screen built into the seat in front of me lit up, and suddenly, my gaze was glued to a multitude of colors flashing in quick succession. 

Red. 

Orange. 

Yellow. 

Blue. 

Green. 

*Repeat*. 

Bobby and Nick seemed to be entranced by the colors, unblinking eyes drawn to each one, their faces relaxing, arms falling limply by their sides. But I *could* move. I could blink, and jerk to the left to shake Bobby, waving my hands in her face. 

When the screen flickered off, the two of them finally blinked rapidly. 

Nick’s half lidded eyes found mine, before widening. 

“Addie, your nose!” he whispered. 

I was bleeding.

I could feel it running down my face, thick red rivulets gushing from my nose. 

The bus came to an abrupt stop, and the panic started.

With no explanation, we were categorized into colors. Red, Purple and Blue. Nick and Bobby were categorized Purple and Blue, and were immediately grabbed and dragged off of the bus. 

While I was red, blood still streaming from my nose. 

It was raining when they dragged the reds from the bus. 

They called us Defects.

Unusable stock. 

I was kneeling in the middle of a field, knee deep in dirt, when the gunshots started. 

BANG. 

I watched other reds drop to the ground dead. 

BANG. 

The girl next to me dropped next. 

BANG. 

Then the boy in front of me.

I had already accepted my death when warm arms grabbed me, dragging me back. 

I screamed, only for a hand to clamp down on my mouth. 

Nick. 

Half of his face skin, the other plastic, a glass eye bulging from his socket. His body was wrong, his arms mutilated sausages hanging limply by his sides. 

“This camp,” his mouth was a skeletal grin stretched across his face. I could see where plastic and glass had been infused, entangled through his bones.

\#The experiment

I've got a christmas holiday project running here: making a better Google Home / Alexa.

For this, i needed a feature, and i've created the feature 4 times to see how the different models perform. The feature is an integration of LLM memory, so i can say ""i dont like eggs, remember that"", and then it wont give me recipes with eggs anymore.

This is the prompt i gave all 4 of them:

`We need a new azure functions project that acts as a proxy for storing information in an azure table storage.`  
  
`As parameters we need the text of the information and a tablename. Use the connection string in the ""StorageConnectionString"" env var. We need to add, delete and readall memories in a table.`  
  
`After that is done help me to deploy the function with the ""az"" cli tool.`  
  
`After that, add a tool to store memories in @/BlazorWasmMicrophoneStreaming/Services/Tools/ , see the other tools there to know how to implement that. Then, update the AiAccessService.cs file to inject the memories into the system prompt.`

  
(For those interested in the details: this is a Blazor WASM .net app that needs a proxy to access the table storage for storing memories, since accessing the storage from WASM directly is a fuggen pain. Its a function because as a hobby project, i minimize costs as much as possible).

The development is done with the CLINE extension of VSCode. 

  
The challenges to solve:

1) Does the model adher the custom instructions i put into the editor?

https://preview.redd.it/q1kclg0atm9e1.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e91a73756eba3e23dc55131adcb8079c0f78f21

2) Is the most up to date version of the package chosen?

3) are files and implementations found by mentioning them without a direct pointer?

4) Are all 3 steps (create a project, deploy a project, update an existing bigger project) executed?

5) Is the implementation technically correct?

6) Cost efficiency: are there unnecesary loops?

  
Note that i am not gunning for 100% perfect code in one shot. I let LLMs do the grunt work and put in the last 10% of effort myself.

  
Additionally, i checked how long it took to reach the final solution and how much money went down the drain in the meantime.

  
Here is the TLDR; the field reports with how the models each reached their goal (or did not even do  that) are below.

https://preview.redd.it/je306buwan9e1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=1376558b37c89b6e1ee0cb6f2549a7908aa02e18

\#Sonnet

Claude-3-5-sonnet worked out solid as always. The VS code extension and my experience grew with it, so there is no surprise that there was no surprise here.  Claude did not ask me questions though: he wanted to create resources in azure that were already there instead of asking if i want to reuse an existing resource. Problems arising in the code and in the CLI were discovered and fixed automatically. Also impressive: Sonnet prefilled the URL of the tool after the deployment from the deployment output.

One negative thing though: For my hobby projects i am just a regular peasant, capacity wise (compared to my professional life, where tokens go brrrr without mercy), which means i depend on the lowest anthropic API tier. Here i hit the limit after roughly 20 cents already, forcing me to switch to openrouter. The transition to openrouter is not seamless though, propably because the cache is now missing that the anthropic API had build up. Also the cost calculation gets wrong as soon as we switch to OpenRouter. While Cline says 60cents were used, the OpenRouter statistics actually says 2,1$.

  
\#Gemini

After some people were enthusiastic about the new exp models from google i wanted to give them a try as well. I am still not sure i chose the best contender with gemini-experimental though. Maybe some flash version would have been better? Please let me know. So this was the slowest of the bunch with 20 minutes from start to finish. But it also asked me the most questions. Right at the creation of the project he asked me about the runtime to use, no other model did that. It took him 3 tries to create the bare project, but succeeded in the end.  Gemini insisted on creating multiple files for each of the CRUD actions. That's fair i guess, but not really necessary (Don't be offended SOLID principle believers). Gemini did a good job of already predicting the deployment by using the config file for the ENV var. That was cool. After completing 2 of 3 tasks the token limit was reached though and i had to do the deployment in a different task. That's a prompting issue for sure, but it does not allow for the same amount of laziness as the other models. 24 hours after thee experiment the google console did not sync up with the aistudio of google, so i have no idea how much money it cost me. 1 cent? 100$? No one knows. Boo google.

\#o1-mini

o1-mini started out promising with a flawless setup of the project and had good initial code in it, using multiple files like gemini did. Unlike gemini however it was painfully slow, so having multiple  files felt bad. o1-mini also boldly assumed that he had to create a resource group for me, and tried to do so on a different continent. o1-mini then decided to use the wrong package for the access to the storage. After i intervened and told him the right package name it was already 7 minutes in in which he tried to publish the project for deployment. That is also when an 8 minute fixing rage started which destroyed more than what was gained from it. After 8 minutes he thought he should downgrade the .NET version to get it working, at which point i stopped the whole ordeal. o1-mini failed, and cost me 2.2$ while doing it. 

  
\#Deepseek

i ran the experiment with deepseek twice: first through openrouter because the official deepseek website had a problem, and then the next day when i ran it again with the official deepseek API.

Curiously, running through openrouter and the deepseek api were different experiences. Going through OR, it was dumber. It wanted to delete code and not replace it. It  got caught up in duplicating files. It was a mess. After a while it even stopped working completely on openrouter.

In contrast, going through the deepseek API was a joyride. It all went smooth, code was looking good. Only at the deployment it got weird. Deepseek tried to do a manual zip deployment, with all steps done individually. That's outdated. This is one prompt away from being a non-issue, but i wanted to see where he ends up. It worked in the end, but it felt like someone had too much coffee. He even build the connection string to the storage himself by looking up the resource. I didn't know you could even do that, i guess yes. So that was interesting.

  
\#Conclusion

All models provided a good codebase that was just a few human guided iterations away from working fine.

For me for now, it looks like microsoft put their money on the wrong horse, at least for this use case of agentic half-automatic coding. Google, Anthropic and even an open source model performed better than the o1-mini they push.



Code-Quality wise i think Claude still has a slight upper hand over Deepseek, but that is only some experience with prompting Deepseek away from being fixed. Then looking at the price, Deepseek clearly won. 2$ vs 0.02$. So there is much, much more room for errors and redos and iterations than it is for claude.  Same for gemini: maybe its just some prompting that is missing and it works like a charm. Or i chose the wrong model to begin with.

  
I will definetly go forward using Deepseek now in CLINE, reverting to claude when something feels off, and copy-paste prompting o1-mini when it looks realy grimm, algorithm-wise. 

For some reason using OpenRouter diminishes my experience. Maybe some model switching i am unaware of?

I have the Baratza Encore ESP and am currently facing an issue where the ground coffee comes out clumpy, and I lose 1-2 grams every time.

In the first 1-3 months, I didn’t have this problem. I was able to set the grind size to 10, grind 18 grams of beans, and get 18 grams out without any issues.

I’m still using the same type of beans and have thoroughly cleaned the grinder multiple times.
What could be causing the clumping and loss?

Thanks in advance!",3,1735416841.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We met for coffee earlier this year, but since we live in different cities, we didn't date—just stayed in touch, texting, talking a lot, and flirting (he's been more flirty than me, and at one point, I thought he was more into me than I was into him).

We went on a date again during the holidays, and the attraction was obvious—we talked for hours, flirted, and made out. Now I'm wondering if he's genuinely interested in something more or just enjoying the moment. We've even joked about moving to the same city since we're both considering relocating.

I really like him, and he's the first person I've felt long-term potential with in a while (I've been single for over 6 years), but I don't want to misread the situation or build something in my head that isn't real.

It wasn't a two sided break up (I was dumped) but we ended on good terms (no yelling or name calling or anything like that). While I was devestated and part of me will still love him for a while longer, I know that I can't be in a relationship with him any time soon. Like, not for years given all the work he'd need to do to be a good partner.

For context: I''d love to be platonic friends with my ex, so I reached out a couple months ago asking if he wanted to go to a hobby thing with me but he said he wasn't ready. I respected that and haven't messaged him since. We did get coffee about 2 months after the breakup, but that was more of a postmortem thing since I was still desperately in love at the time. I've gone on plenty of dates and met some great guys, so I'm ready to move on but haven't met the right person yet.

Current Situation: My ex texted me late on Christmas (before midnight so it wasn't to weird, but late enough that I wonder if he was waiting to see if i would text) just to say he hoped the holidays were going well. We didn't chat much that night since his text and my response didn't include any questions. I want to wish him happy new years on Jan 1 to be friendly and maybe catch up a bit. But idk

Do you think the Christmas text could be a sign that he's ready or wants to try being friends? I don't want to seem like a desperate ex and I also don't want to accidentally misjudge how much I've moved on and if I'm ready for platonic friendship. Does anyone have any advice or stories?
