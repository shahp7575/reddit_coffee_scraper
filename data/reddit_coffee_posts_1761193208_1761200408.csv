I'm a 40yo female hetero-aroace (Miransexual, Pseudosexual, Demirose and Lithromantic specifically). I consider myself a demigirl (afab she/her). Relatively new to the world of being aroace, having only discovered I fit in when I was 37! Looking for friends and maybe a relationship. My favourite things to do are hang out with my Mini Poodle and go op shopping. I also own 2 cats and 6 budgies. I was born with a disability and am a paraplegic in a manual wheelchair. This isn't an issue for me personally, and only an issue if places are not wheelchair accessible. Other things I really enjoy are binging serial killer docos, animal training and horse or animal stuff lol. I am a very down to earth person with a cheeky sense of humour. Very loyal, honest and trustworthy to a fault. I hold my morals, values, ethics and integrity to a very high level.

1odvrxn,https://i.redd.it/dskzdlm20twf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary — Wednesday: We Went Viral (Again!),"This morning started with my phone vibrating nonstop.
Bzz! Bzz! Bzz!
I thought it was just the alarm… until I saw over a hundred notifications.

Carmen’s message popped up first:

> “Amy!!! WE’RE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF COFFEE DAY’S CHANNEL!!”



I opened it — and there we were!
The Coffee Day Smoothie Special video had gone live overnight.
The thumbnail showed me and Zoe side-by-side, both holding colorful smoothies and smiling with that bright, cheerful energy.
The title read:

> 🌈 “When Coffee Meets Color — The SisterBean Smoothie Challenge!”



The view count? Already at 120,000 before breakfast!
Penny texted in all caps:

> “AMY YOUR SMILE IS EVERYWHERE 😭💖”



When I got to school, everyone was talking about it.
Even students from other classes came over to peek into ours.
Siu Ling said, “You guys are celebrities now!”
Monique grinned, “My aunt in Singapore just sent me the video link saying, ‘Look at these cute kids!’”

Our teacher, Mrs. Bloom, couldn’t help smiling.
“Well, I suppose I should congratulate our young entrepreneurs-slash-influencers,” she said teasingly.
Winfrey added proudly, “It’s not fame — it’s creativity awareness!”

By recess, reporters from the School Chronicle came to interview us.
They set up their notepads and recorders and asked questions like,

> “How did you come up with the idea of SisterBean?”
“What was it like working with Zoe and the Coffee Day team?”
“And what advice would you give to students who want to start their own projects?”



Amy blushed a little but answered honestly:
“I think it all started with friendship. We just wanted to make something fun together — and Zoe taught us that even small ideas can turn into something big if we enjoy it.”

The reporters smiled. “That’s beautiful. And that quote’s definitely going on the cover.”
Carmen whispered, “Amy’s going to be famous again.”

After school, we went back to Coffee Day to celebrate.
Zoe was already waiting for us, looking proud as ever.
She said softly, “You girls made everyone smile this week. That’s what this café is really about — warmth, joy, and a touch of sweetness.”

Haruka handed us a framed photo of our smoothie team — us, Zoe, and the whole Coffee Day staff, all holding colorful drinks and laughing together.
Below it was written:

> “Stay Colorful, Stay Kind.”



That night, when I came home, Mom and all my sisters were watching the Coffee Day video on TV — again.
Shelley joked, “Next time you’ll need a manager, Miss Internet Star.”
I laughed, “No way! I just want more smoothies.”
Mom smiled warmly. “Well, you’ve got both — sweetness and success.”",1,1761200084.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

1odvpq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1odvpq8/should_u_join_bosch_as_intern/,Should u join Bosch as intern?,"

I joined Bosch this summer as an intern, and honestly, the experience wasn’t what I expected at all.

They arranged my laptop after almost two weeks, and I wasn’t the only one, some interns who joined before me didn’t even get laptops at all and had to work on old desktops that constantly crashed.

The stipend was pretty low too, around ₹15k–₹20k, and a few interns were even *unpaid*. Unless you’re from Bangalore or have financial support, it’s tough to survive on that.

Thankfully, my mentor and manager were genuinely great people — super supportive and understanding — but that’s not the case everywhere, especially in some of the L.O.s departments.

As for the “welcome kit”, there wasn’t really one. They handed me a ₹20 notebook and a coffee mug. No proper notepad, no company merch, nothing. Later they gave me a **headset and mouse**, which I assumed were part of the kit — but now they’re asking for those back too. Seriously???? 

And don’t even get me started on the **HR team**. Chandra and SRaju were a nightmare to deal with. They never give clear instructions, cause unnecessary chaos, and then somehow twist things around to blame you later.

Honestly, I expected a lot more professionalism from a brand like **Bosch**. Even small startups handle interns better than this. The whole experience just felt cheap and unorganized.

1odvpbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1odvpbw/my_little_story/,My little story,"The hardest part is starting, even if I share it here, I don't know if anyone will read it. You have so many ideas on how to begin, and sometimes—like today—you don't even know where to begin. The beginning? But where exactly is that beginning? Maybe with how my mom and I rescued four wonderful animals—two dogs and two kittens, who now live together in peace. Most people would probably think that's boring. But what if I told the story of being robbed—through my own stupidity and exhaustion? Oh, tragedies always sell better, right? So here's my little tragedy that befell my mom and me.

This story begins with the desire to escape. To escape from a place that reminded us of our deceased dad—a wonderful man, a loving husband, and a supporter until the end. My parents lived in Crete, Greece. A fairytale place… as long as my dad was alive. When he passed away, the fairytale ended. Nothing kept us there anymore, so we decided to sell the house. Unfortunately, the process dragged on endlessly. Meanwhile, my mother was wondering where she could settle. I had previously lived in Denmark—until my father's death—and that was the country I suggested. Listening to my stories about Denmark, my mother enthusiastically and hopefully declared that a new adventure awaited us there. We began preparing to move and explore the new place. The animals were vaccinated and prepared for travel, and we were just waiting for the house sales agreement to be signed. We even managed to find a buyer surprisingly quickly, but the house transfer process itself dragged on for almost a year.

Finally, the documents were signed. It was time to find a transport that would take not only our belongings but also us and our beloved animals.

 

**July 15th – July 23rd**

Everything started well. I received word from the notary that we would be signing the house sales agreement on July 18th – finally! After so many months, we were officially ending this phase of our lives. However, joy quickly mixed with pressure. The new owner was impatient – ​​he wanted to move in as early as August. This meant I urgently needed to find transport for us, our belongings, and our animals. I called every company I could, but I was met with rejection: ""We don't transport animals"" or ""We don't transport passengers, only cargo."" I even tried popular classifieds websites, but the story repeated itself – everyone only wanted goods, not people.

Finally, one person – let's call her Ms. Grażyna – responded. She said that transporting dogs might be a problem, but she didn't rule it out. This gave me hope. In subsequent conversations, she sounded increasingly convincing – she claimed that if the load exceeded 1,500 kg, two vans or a van with a trailer would be necessary. Ultimately, I decided that a van with a trailer would be enough. I paid 1,500 euros in advance, purchased special cargo for animals, as Mrs. Grażyna had requested, and purchased ferry tickets—with a cabin adapted for animals. Tired but happy, I spent the next few days packing the rest of my belongings. We set the departure date for July 28th—that's when we were all supposed to sail together.

**July 27**

The day started unexpectedly early. At 6:31 a.m., the driver—let's call him Mr. Janusz. The voice on the other end was strained: ""My front left tire blew out. Someone probably punctured it during the night.""

My mom and I were surprised he showed up a day early, but we took it as a good sign—maybe we'd get through the move faster. Mom was packing the last of our things, and I frantically searched for help with the car repair. Finally, Mr. Janusz announced he'd take care of everything himself.

At 10:24 a.m., he called again. ""The car's fixed, I'm on my way,"" he said, his tone brimming with exhaustion but also confidence.

Packing began at high noon, in the unbearable heat. From 12:00 to 4:00 p.m., the heat was unbearable. Sweat poured down our backs, and the air was heavy as lead. I felt a sun-induced headache slowly spreading across my temples, but I gritted my teeth—just to finish. During the loading, Mr. Janusz repeatedly reiterated that the load was very heavy, but ultimately assured me that ""he could handle it."" We weren't familiar with the technical details, so we trusted his experience and professionalism.

However, we couldn't load everything—some of our belongings had to be left behind in Crete. And then he said a sentence that drove me to my knees:

""Ladies, you're not coming with me. There's no room."" We froze. Just the day before, we'd agreed to go together—my mother, the dogs, and the cats. Everything had been planned so well. Now, everything fell apart in an instant.

Panicked, we started looking for an alternative. We had to find transportation for ourselves and the animals—immediately. Time was running out, and one question was racing through my mind: what now? I asked Mr. Janusz if we could pay 1,000 euros now, and the remaining 2,000 euros after the load was delivered to Denmark. I explained that we now had to use the money intended for the driver to arrange our transport. To my surprise, he agreed.

He even helped us temporarily – he offered a flight to Denmark for 1,900 euros, but it quickly became clear that this was impossible. We couldn't fly without luggage. We had our documents, personal belongings, and, above all, our animals. Tired, sweaty, and resigned, we watched the bus depart. Inside – our memories, our life's work, traces of our father. Back then, we still believed we'd see it all again in a few days. We didn't know this was just the beginning of the nightmare.

28/07

At 9:38 a.m., Mr. Janusz called. His voice was strained, clipped. ""Another tire blew out. This time, the right front tire. The load is too heavy.""

I froze. This was the second tire in two days. Disturbing thoughts began to swirl in my head, but I tried to push them aside—we couldn't afford to panic. Meanwhile, my mother, my mother's Greek friend, and I continued our frantic search for transportation. We explored every option—planes, buses, even special taxis for animals—but everything ended in rejection. We could fly without luggage, but how could we leave our documents? It was out of the question.

In desperation, my mother called her friend Dorota from France. Together we tried to come up with a solution, but neither of us had any ideas. Time flew by. The heat was becoming unbearable, and the air in the house felt as thick as an oven. I felt tension tighten in my stomach.

I told my mother, ""The most important thing is that we get off the island. Then we'll figure something out.""

She looked at me with tired but determined eyes. She nodded. The problem, however, was how to get from our village to Heraklion. Luckily, the new owner of the house, even though he'd just bought it, agreed to drive us there. As a token of gratitude, we paid for his gas.

At 3:43 PM, a message arrived from Ms. Grażyna: ""The car and trailer were weighed in the port – 2.8 tons. That's 1.5 tons more than before."" I no longer had the strength to react. In my haste, I ignored the email.

That day, at 9:00 PM, we were supposed to catch the ferry. Packed, exhausted, but full of hope that the stress was over – we made it just in time. Before boarding the ferry, my mother noticed Mr. Janusz. He was standing with a Greek man, chatting. She went to him because the day before, he'd mentioned that a friend of his wanted to sell the car. We were both interested, so she wanted to know more. Mr. Janusz assured me that the car was in excellent condition and that all that was needed was a document confirming that my mother had power of attorney. The Greek man he spoke with quickly explained that it wasn't that simple – a full re-registration procedure would be necessary, which takes at least a day. The document Mr. Janusz mentioned would have no legal validity. My mother, knowing a little Greek, understood the situation and, with a smile and a hint of disappointment, thanked both men.

Finally, Mr. Janusz showed us a document showing the weight of 3 tons. ""With the driver, it's 3 tons, without me, 2.9 tons,"" he explained. He added that because of this excess weight, we had to cover the additional fuel costs. That evening, as we sat on the ferry, my mother was quiet. She stared out to sea, as if to leave all the chaos there. I stared at the dark waves and tried to convince myself that these were just temporary difficulties, that everything would work out. I truly believed it back then.

July 29

The morning greeted us with weary light and heavy air. At 6:15 a.m., the ferry reached Athens, at the port of Piraeus. There was no time to catch our breath—we immediately started looking for new transportation. At 8:01 a.m., Mr. Janusz called. He sounded nervous, as if he were looking for someone to blame. ""The trailer broke down—it stopped at the intersection and wouldn't move. The load was too heavy. It's your fault. I left 22 packages behind."" At that moment, I wanted to scream, but I was too tired to do so. Only one thing was pulsing in my head: to stay calm.

I apologized to him, even though it wasn't our fault. I tempered my emotions so the situation wouldn't spiral out of control. Little did I know then that this ""trailer"" would be the beginning of a long nightmare. Meanwhile, my mother and I frantically tried to organize anything to take us and the animals onward. Even the pet taxis refused. Time was running out—we had to catch the next ferry at 7:00 PM from Patras to Ancona. At 9:57 AM, a text arrived from Mr. Janusz: ""Do you have a car yet? There's a friend in Athens who runs a used car dealership. He sells cheaply."" He gave me his phone number. I texted, called—nothing. It wasn't until a few hours later, around 1:00 PM, that I got the address. My mother went there alone, even though the sun was beating down mercilessly.

At 1:12 PM, she returned. She was flushed with heat, sweating, and carrying a bottle of water.

""There's nothing there,"" she said simply. ""No dealership, no cars."" But I saw a glint in her eyes—she wasn't giving up. ""I found a ride. He'll be there to pick us up any minute.""

At 2:36 PM, the taxi driver showed up. When he saw our dogs and cats, he first clutched his head, but after a moment, he just sighed. ""Okay, we'll manage.""

He was tired, but honest. We set off towards Patras, and the drive seemed to drag on forever.

At 5:00 PM, we arrived. The ride cost 450 euros. We had no choice—we paid, knowing that every hour of delay could mean losing everything. I ran to buy ferry tickets. I had to pay extra for a cabin where pets were allowed. 700 euros. I felt my wallet getting lighter and my insides getting emptier.

At 10:00 PM, we took the ferry to Ancona. The sea was calm, but my mind was racing. My mother called Dorota, texted her—we'd arranged for Dorota to come from France to Milan and meet there. That evening, in the middle of the sea, between Greece and Italy, I thought for the first time that maybe it wasn't a coincidence at all. That something was starting to stink about this story—and it wasn't just the flat tires anymore.

 **July 30**

The ferry rocked gently, as if trying to lull us to sleep. Through the cabin window, we could see the milky sea, slowly gaining color with the dawn. There was something strangely peaceful about it, like the calm before a storm. Mom sat beside us, cuddling one of the dogs. The cats were asleep in their carriers, as tired as we were. I felt salt on my lips, in my throat, and on my hands—not only from the sea, but also from the tears that wouldn't even fall. As we approached Ancona, we began to seek help from the crew. We asked for any contact information, anyone who could take us to Milan. The ferryman, an older Italian with a gentle gaze, promised to look around. A few hours later, he brought word: he'd found someone. The price—850 euros. We had no choice.

At 2:06 PM, I received an email from Grażyna. The ""damage"" estimate – 850 euros for the destroyed trailer. I stared at my phone screen, and the letters were starting to blur. I felt something inside me break. I was still on the road, still unsure about our belongings, and I was already about to pay for their mistakes.

That evening, at 7:23 PM, I texted Dorota. ""We're already in Ancona. We're waiting for a taxi."" In response: ""Hang in there. I'll be waiting for you in Milan.""

Around 10:00 PM, we set off. Italian roads at that hour smelled of hot asphalt and dust. The car sped through the night, headlights flashing past us like sparks, and the dogs curled up in the backseat. Mom dozed, holding my hand, like she did when I was a child and afraid of thunderstorms.

At 3:33 AM, we arrived at the hotel in Milan. Dorota was already there. When she opened the door for us, my mother simply embraced her—for a long time, without words, as if to release all the stress, fear, and exhaustion of the past few days with a single embrace.

In the morning, at 9:07 a.m., there were tears, smiles, and a quiet breakfast in the small hotel dining room, smelling of coffee. For the first time in weeks, I felt a kind of relief. But I knew this was just a break, not the end.

At 10:53 a.m., we set off again—towards Germany. Mountain landscapes flashed through the car windows, and I thought about how surreal this journey had been. Two dogs, two cats, three women, and thousands of kilometers behind us.

Around 6:00 p.m., we stopped for the night. We finally caught our breath. I sat on the bed with my phone, looking for someone to pick up our packages. We succeeded. Someone agreed to secure them.

That was the first small glimmer of hope. That same day, I received a message telling me exactly where Janusz had left our things. I felt angry, but also helpless—we were hundreds of kilometers away.

The rescue operation took me days. It wasn't until August 7th that I managed to transport the packages to a safe place. I paid €223.20 to the person who took them.

At 7:17 PM, Ms. Grażyna again requested a transfer. I replied at 7:55 PM: ""The money will be ready on the spot."" I also wrote about problems with my mother's account—that it had a daily withdrawal limit, that we weren't doing it on purpose. The response was silence. But I sensed one thing from the tone of the earlier messages: indifference. That evening, for the first time, I realized that the people we trusted never had good intentions towards us.

**August 1**

In the morning, I woke up to the sound of notifications. Ms. Grażyna was texting again—increasingly insisting that we pay by bank transfer. I sensed she was starting to lose patience, but I still believed she was simply stressed about the situation. I was at the end of my rope myself.

My phone was failing more and more frequently. The battery was draining at an alarming rate, and calls were cutting off mid-sentence. I thought it was from constant use, but in the back of my mind, I felt a twinge of anxiety. Finally, a friend who had access to my number texted me that I was running low on credit—he topped up my account so I could stay connected. This gesture, small and quiet, meant a lot back then.

At 3:59 PM, a text arrived from Ms. Grażyna. ""Ms. Agata, Mr. Janusz had an accident last night.""

I froze. I read it several times, as if my brain refused to accept the meaning of the words. In an instant, I felt something strange—a mixture of shock, sympathy, and fear. Not anger, not suspicion, just genuine sadness. No matter how difficult the situation was for us—an accident is a tragedy. I immediately wrote that I hoped nothing serious had happened to him. I received no reply.

Ms. Grażyna repeated the question in subsequent messages: ""Did you receive my email with the estimate?"" I replied that I had, and that we had the cash ready. I was still willing to pay, as long as everything was resolved honestly.

My mother, however, was uneasy. She sat down next to me and said quietly,

""You know, I'd like to at least see our things before we pay. It's not about the money... I'm afraid that something of Dad's mementos might have been damaged."" I listened to her and felt she was right. I knew that even if our things were damaged, we would have paid. We just wanted to know they were safe.

That evening, when the emotions had subsided a bit, I remembered the website I'd used to search for transportation. I wanted to check if Ms. Grażyna had ever officially submitted an offer there. Not to prove anything—I just wanted to be fair. I still thought well of her. She and Mr. Janusz seemed like ordinary, helpful people back then, just beset by an unfortunate chain of events. I believed them. I truly did.

**August 2nd**

We arrived at our destination late in the afternoon. It was hot, the air stagnant, as if even it no longer had the strength to move. I stepped out of the car as if in a trance—exhaustion, stress, and sleepless nights had taken their toll. I felt as if I hadn't had a body for weeks, just a stiff shell that somehow still functioned.

Grażyna kept texting. More messages, reminders, requests for transfers. It felt more and more like pressure, not a conversation. I replied calmly: ""The cash is ready. We'll pay when we meet there."" But with each passing day, her tone became drier, colder.

That was the first time I felt something I hadn't wanted to admit before—fear. Not the kind that paralyzes, but the quiet fear that warns: something's not right.

Mom and I talked for a long time. She told me she was worried that if we paid upfront, we might never see our things. I looked at her, and for the first time, I couldn't calm her down. I started asking friends who had experience in transport what the situation was like. They all said the same thing: never pay in advance unless you can guarantee receipt of the goods. I wanted to believe that Ms. Grażyna was honest, that it was just a misunderstanding. But with each message, that faith weakened.

In the meantime, I contacted a lawyer—not to accuse anyone, but to understand our rights. I wanted to be sure we were acting appropriately.

Someone once said that trust is the most valuable currency. That day, I began to feel like I'd lost almost everything, but what hurt me most was this: that I was starting to lose trust and distrust in people.

And then a message from Ms. Grażyna arrived on WhatsApp. ""You have a lawyer, and you're recording me."" I froze. I didn't have a lawyer. I wasn't recording anyone. I don't know where she got that from. Maybe it was fear? Maybe guilt? Or maybe she was just trying to turn the tables. Looking back on it now, I know that back then I was still trying to believe in good intentions. I thought that if we just stayed calm, everything would be cleared up. But with each passing day, I felt more and more that there was more to it than just coincidence.

I didn't yet know that this wasn't the end of this journey—just another stage in which trust would become the most expensive thing I would pay.

When the emotions began to subside, I thought it was over. That the story with Ms. Grażyna and Mr. Janusz was just a sad chapter in a long journey. For a moment, I truly believed that all I had to do was stop, catch my breath, and let time heal what had happened.

But time doesn't heal everything. Some memories just wait for you to look away for a moment—then they come back, sharper, more painful than before.

Weeks passed. My mother and I were starting to believe that maybe we could simply move on. That even if we didn't get everything back, at least we would regain some peace. But then October arrived. A phone call, a message, a location.

6:10

That day, I received information about our belongings. I turned on the map and froze. The satellite view showed something that looked more like an abandoned yard than a warehouse. Scattered pallets, mud, garbage. I felt something tighten inside me. Mom stood beside me, staring at the screen. ""We're going,"" she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

She was 62 years old, and her eyes held the same twinkle she always had—a mixture of courage and stubbornness.

""Mom, it's thousands of kilometers, and I don't even have a driver's license,"" I tried to explain. She smiled faintly. ""It's nothing. We'll manage. We always manage.""

I couldn't stop her. Maybe I didn't want to. I knew this was more than just a journey to collect our belongings—it was a fight for dignity. For the right not to let anyone make us feel like victims.

We packed up and set off in our little Kia Picanto. Two hearts fueled by pure exhaustion and determination. The journey from Denmark to Poland seemed endless. The cabin smelled of coffee and silence—the heavy silence when you're afraid to say something that might shatter your own hope.

 

**8:10**

We arrived. Tired, but even happy. On the way, I managed to find a transport company – I informed them that there might be problems, even the police, but please be ready. The woman on the other end of the phone had a warm voice. ""Don't worry. We'll be there."" We agreed: pick-up for 330 euros, and then transport from Poland to Denmark for 2,250 euros. Everything was supposed to start on October 9th.

9:10

I was tense from the morning. Mrs. Grażyna knew we'd arrive at 9:00. We just wanted to see our things – make sure they were still there. She agreed, but after a few minutes, she called our lawyer, saying that her lawyer hadn't given her permission to enter.

It was absurd. The police had already informed her that they had no right to keep our things. She had promised to return them as soon as we arrived. And that's exactly what we did – we arrived.

At the given addresses – silence. No one had heard of such a company.

But I wasn't the same person I had been before. Not the one who trusted blindly. I found a public document—an official one from the municipal office—with Mr. Janusz's details and address. I knew that was where we would find them.

When we arrived at their house with the lawyer, Ms. Grażyna paled. Her expression was priceless—a mixture of shock, shame, and anger. She knew there was no turning back.

Finally, she had to show us our belongings. We went together. The police arrived some time later, because, of course, Ms. Grażyna tried to stop the shipment and send back a new shipment. But this time, she failed to intimidate us.

When our belongings finally arrived in Denmark, my mother and I were so exhausted we had no energy left. The very fact that the shipment had arrived at all seemed like a small miracle at the time. However, we didn't have time to check everything right away. Only a few days later, when we were unpacking the boxes, did the truth come out.

My heart sank. My mother's porcelain—smashed. My father's belongings—broken. My porcelain dolls—in pieces. My drawing tablets—vanished. I stood among the boxes, looking at the mess, and felt tears streaming down my cheeks. Not from anger. From grief.

Because how do you explain to someone that it's not the objects that hurt the most, but the memories that lived within them? Each piece of porcelain was like a shard of a former life—a life that could no longer be glued back together.

My mother, the widow of her husband of over 37 years, was robbed of the remnants of his presence. And I—who had always defended Poland and believed it was a country of beautiful people and kind hearts—felt that feeling die within me for a second time.

Maybe we were just unlucky with people. Or maybe there are simply too many ""Janusz and Grażyna"" like this.

Today, October 21st, as I write this, it's still hard for me to believe that all this really happened. But I know one thing—even if the world can be merciless, my mother and I got through it together.

And perhaps this is where our strength lies: that despite pain and disappointment, we still manage to move forward. Because what has survived within us—love, persistence, and hope—is something that can never be taken away from anyone.

Perhaps this is where our strength lies—that despite tragedy, pain, and a sense of injustice, we still manage to see something good. What happened to us was one of the reasons we fled Poland—a place we once loved, but which became a source of fear, disappointment, and sadness. Now, though my mother and I are still recovering—she from the stress that likely caused her to have a minor stroke and lose the sight in one eye, and I from battling negative thoughts and inner hatred—we're trying to find meaning in it all. We're trying not to give up and to believe that even the darkest experiences can bring lessons that we will one day fully understand.

If I had more strength and time, this story could probably have turned out differently, maybe even with a happy ending, because I never pay in advance, but we were against a wall... It turned out the way it did. And although sometimes regret and a sense of loss creep into my heart, I know I have to move forward. We can only learn to move on, with our heads held high.

The only real positive I see in this is that we crossed half of Europe with our four pets—all alive. Every step, every hour spent on the road, every moment of uncertainty reminded me how fragile life is and how much safety and closeness matter. We were deceived, exploited, betrayed by people who should have supported each other because, after all, we are Polish, but despite everything, we survived. Our animals—the little creatures who brought so much joy, affection, and love to our lives—were our anchor, our reason to keep going, to not give up, to never doubt.

I have a wonderful mother, a strong and steadfast woman who, despite pain and fear, still tries to support me. I have extraordinary animals who are now my greatest joy and greatest responsibility. Each one teaches me something about patience, loyalty, and unconditional love. They show me that life, though full of suffering, also brings the most beautiful moments—quiet, everyday moments that fill the heart with peace.

That's why I decided to sell everything that still ties me to that place and the past—I don't want to ever cling to things again and end it all. I want my life to be full of true connections, moments that stay in my heart, not on shelves or in closets. I want to remember what we've been through, not to dwell on the past, but to draw from it the strength and courage to live here and now.

I want every day to remind me that what's invisible to the eye is most precious—love, presence, safety, and peace of mind. I want to surround myself with people who can empathize, who know that life isn't always fair, and who, despite this, don't lose their inherent kindness. I want my decisions and every step I take to be conscious, full of respect for others, filled with gratitude for what I have and for those around me.

Sometimes at night, when I look at our animals sleeping next to their mother, I feel that despite all the hardships, we are in a safe place—a place that is our home, not just physically. And that's what gives me hope. Hope that even after the greatest storm, peace comes. Hope that what we've lost doesn't define us, but only strengthens us. Hope that the feelings we have, the bonds we create, and the love we share are what truly give life meaning.

I want everyone who reads this story to feel even a little of what I felt—that mixture of pain and hope, loss and gratitude. Because sometimes, to see the true beauty of the world, you have to go through hell. This is my little story. Best regards.

For some context, I (19NB) live with two roommates, who I’ll call Remy (19M) and Nickel (19M), in a three bedroom apartment due to living costs. We’ve been friends since before we moved in together though, with me meeting Nickel in our freshman year of college and Remy all the way back in early elementary. So we started the lease already pretty close and, because we tend to communicate any issues we have with one another, I was confident that there wouldn’t be any issues while we lived together. 

For the most part, I’m someone who tends to spend most of their day just, doing their own thing and having fun on their own. This isn’t to say that I’ve completely isolated myself—I still talk to my roommates, family, and other friends—I just like doing my own thing most of the time. It’s also important to note that I’ve been really busy with college and work so I’ve spent a lot of time working inside my room. All of these are things my roommates know about and I honestly didn’t think there was much of an issue with it since I still do my schoolwork, work at my actual job, and most importantly, pay all of my bills on time. At least until a couple days ago when I was summoned into the living room by Remy and was greeted by Remy and Nickel sitting on the couch. And after sitting down on the floor (I had chili and I wanted to eat over the coffee table), I was asked if I actually wanted to live there. This was honestly a shock and I didn’t really know what to say, so I just responded with yes and asked why they would ask.

Apparently, while I had thought that everything was all fine and dandy, my two roommates were actually pretty bothered with me doing my own thing, telling me that they never hung out with me and were wondering why I wasn’t living in the dorms if I wanted to just do my own thing, even asking if I was only living there for the money. This all threw me off guard because I didn’t think it was that big of a deal but they seemed to believe it was, telling me straight up that they wanted a roommate that hung out with them more often while also saying that they didn’t want to force me to be an extrovert, just wanted me to hang out with them more. And while I originally just went along with what they were saying because they were my friends and from a friend standpoint, it made sense that they’d want to hang out more, it later kind of occurred to me just how weird it all felt from a roommate standpoint. Especially since, after saying that they wanted a roommate who’d hang out with them, they mentioned our lease renewal and another friend of theirs, seeming to almost imply that if I couldn’t do that, they’d consider rooming with her instead. However, I still don’t really know if I’m in the wrong because, while my roommates certainly think that I am, others that I’ve shared this story with have said that I haven’t done anything wrong. So, reddit, AITA?

1. The charity option. You don't offer anything extra. People who pay you support your work and they know they get nothing in return, only the feel-good factor of financing great work.

2. The business option. You put most of your value behind the paywall and only occasionally you offer free teaser content or excerpts. People pay to get the content.

3. The hybrid option. You offer nearly everything for free, but very occasionally (maybe once per month) you offer something extra for paying subscribers, like a free download or something.

I do option 3.

I write (what I hope is) really good essays and then I tell my subscribers, ""I write so you don't have to. If you support me by paying for my coffees, I will keep writing.""

The monthly fee of my newsletter is exactly the price of a cappuccino in my local coffee bar. It helps to remind my readers that they're not paying for exclusive articles, they're paying to keep me going. And once per month or so, I give them something special as a way of saying thank you.

The benefit of the hybrid approach (option 3) is that all my content is free and can be indexed by Google and slurped up by the AI crawlers, which makes my newsletter easier to discover as compared to the business option (option 2). And the incidental free download means I get better conversion to paid as compared to the charity option (option 1).

Preparing grants is very time consuming and the learning curve is huge. Still, I set out to do the task. I have no regrets. But, I do wonder why so many dropout. Therefore it is hard finding the right connections. The underlying assumption of the grantor is that the partners are willing to do the pre work; but maybe reality is different. It is like acquisition of a high net worth client. The one everyone is bragging about. However, most prefer to see this client walking through the door, nice cup of coffee and that's it.

Well, grants are more like state welfare; you have to turn yourself inside out. That's probably because, the real interest and passion isn't there. You need engagement in order to build genuine understanding of what's being done.

In this landscape, doing the actual work feels lonely. No shiny milestones. Only, pure risks hacking. Covering.  Addressing all the 'buts'.

1odvc01,https://i.redd.it/jaiyh7r5vswf1.png,What the Hell is... the God Particle?,"**What the Hell is... the God Particle?**  
  
*By Brent Antonson*

# ❄️ Welcome to the Snowstorm

Picture this: the universe is a giant party. Photons — particles of light — glide through the room untouched, carefree. But then there's you: you try to walk in, and suddenly people recognize you, swarm you, slow you down. You're *famous*, apparently.

Congratulations — you’ve just experienced the **Higgs field**.

And the thing slowing you down? That’s mass. Welcome to one of the most profound ideas in modern physics — that **mass is not a built-in property**. It's **bestowed**, like awkward attention at a high school reunion. And the **Higgs boson** is the proof.

# 📦 What the Hell Is a Boson?

In particle physics, everything is either a **fermion** or a **boson**.

* **Fermions** are the building blocks — electrons, protons, quarks. They're matter.
* **Bosons** are the messengers — they carry the forces. Like the photon (electromagnetism), gluon (strong force), W and Z bosons (weak force), and the theoretical graviton (gravity).

The **Higgs boson** is a special kind of boson. It's not just a messenger — it's the **manifestation of a field** that does something wild:  
It gives mass to other particles.

# 🧠 Predicted by a Quiet Genius in the 1960s

Enter **Peter Higgs**, a soft-spoken British physicist who, in 1964, theorized that a kind of universal field might exist — one that slows down some particles more than others. Like a **quantum snowstorm**, it permeates everything. Some particles get bogged down (like a politician in a scandal), others breeze through.

The idea?

>

And the Higgs boson would be the tiny, fleeting particle that proves the field exists — a ripple in this invisible, all-pervading snowstorm.

# 🧪 So... Where Was It?

For decades, the Higgs boson was **the ghost in the Standard Model** — the last missing piece in the most successful theory of particles and forces ever built.

But it was shy. Or rather, **it required insane amounts of energy to show up**. The kind of energy you get by smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light.

Which is why we needed **CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC)** — a 27-kilometer underground particle racetrack straddling the Swiss-French border. It’s like a particle demolition derby for grown-up geniuses.

# 💥 2012: We Found the Damn Thing

After decades of searching, **July 4th, 2012**, became physics' version of Independence Day. CERN announced it had discovered a new particle with a mass around **125 GeV** — consistent with the Higgs boson.

Cue champagne. Cue tears. Cue Peter Higgs himself — visibly emotional, having lived to see his math become matter.

# 🙄 Why the ""God Particle""?

Blame the media. Or more specifically, **Leon Lederman**, a Nobel-winning physicist who coined the term in his book *The God Particle*. He meant it as both metaphor and marketing:

* Metaphor: because it seemed to **create mass**, like a divine power.
* Marketing: because *The Goddamn Particle* (its working title) was harder to sell.

Higgs himself hated the name. There’s nothing divine about it. But hey — it stuck. And it got people talking.

# ⚖️ Why It Matters

The Higgs boson:

* **Confirms the Standard Model**: Our best theory of how the universe works actually... works.
* **Explains why particles have mass**: Without it, atoms wouldn't form. Stars wouldn’t burn. We wouldn’t exist.
* **Pushes physics into deeper territory**: Like supersymmetry, dark matter, and the quantum structure of spacetime.

In short: it’s the keystone that holds the whole arch together.

# 👀 The Weird Truth

The Higgs field is always “on.” You’re feeling it now. It’s gently embracing every particle in your body, deciding how “heavy” you should be. Without it, the universe would be a lightless void — all particles zipping around at light speed, unable to clump into anything meaningful.

No stars. No planets. No coffee.

# 🌀 Final Thought

So what the hell is the God Particle?

It’s not a god. But it is a kind of **cosmic velvet rope** — separating particles who get to ""have mass"" from those who don’t. It’s the unsung scriptwriter giving the universe form and structure.

And we only found it because humans decided to build a cathedral for subatomic collisions, 300 feet underground.

1odvbix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1odvbix/my_brothers_rival_is_my_secret_master/,My Brother's Rival is My Secret Master,"Growing up as a twin sounds fun, right? Built-in best friend, someone who always has your back, someone who gets you without explanation. That’s what I had—at least for the first ten years of my life.

My twin brother, Jackson, was the center of my world. We were fraternal twins, but opposites in every way. Jackson was tall, lean, athletic, and could make friends with just about anyone. I was short, a little chunky, shy to the point of painful, and usually tripping over my own feet.

But it never mattered to me. I didn’t need a million friends. I had Jackson. He was my best friend, my other half, my person.

It was always just the two of us. Our mom worked constantly to keep food on the table, so most of the time it was just me and him. Maybe that’s why we clung to each other so hard.

“Jax, I wanna go home,” I whined, dragging my feet as he tossed a football from hand to hand.

“Jess, chill. I told the new kid I’d meet him here to throw the ball around,” he said, his brown eyes locked on the field like he was already in the NFL.

“This is boring.” I plopped down on the grass.

He sighed, dug in his pocket, and tossed me a granola bar. “Here. Peanut butter. Your favorite.”

Instant mood boost. “Yes! Thanks, Jax.”

While I was tearing open the wrapper, he straightened up, glancing at the entrance to the field. “That’s him.”

A boy about our age walked toward us, a football tucked under his arm. He had dark, messy brown hair and the greenest eyes I’d ever seen. The kind of eyes you notice right away. And his lashes? Long enough to make me jealous.

“Hey,” he said to Jackson.

“Hey, Noah. This is my twin, Jessa.”

I scrambled up, brushing grass off my jeans. My mouth moved faster than my brain. “Wow… you’ve got really long eyelashes. For a boy.”

Noah’s cheeks turned pink. “Uh, thanks?”

Jackson groaned. “Sorry, she doesn’t have a filter sometimes.”

“I just meant they’re… pretty,” I tried, wishing I could disappear.

“Jess, why don’t you go sit while we toss the ball around,” Jackson muttered.

“She doesn’t play?” Noah asked.

I shook my head before Jackson could answer. “Not really my thing.”

“Nope. If she tried to throw, she’d probably knock herself over,” Jackson joked.

I pretended not to care, sitting back down on the sidelines, but my eyes kept drifting toward Noah as he and Jackson tossed the ball. He wasn’t just cute—he was quiet, too. Almost shy. Something about him made me want him to like me.

After they finished, Jackson clapped him on the back. “You’ve got a good arm.”

“Two older brothers taught me some stuff,” Noah shrugged.

“Oh! So they’re your best friends too, like me and Jackson?” I asked eagerly.

“No. They’re just… brothers. I don’t really have a best friend.”

My heart squeezed. “Then you should get one. Me and Jackson do everything together. He’s the best best friend you could ever have.”

Noah looked at Jackson. Jackson just shrugged. Noah nodded slightly, like he got the message.

At the time, I didn’t realize how wrong I was.

One Month Later

“I don’t wanna go to the movies, Jax!” I whined, arms crossed.

“Too bad. Noah and I wanna see the new Marvel movie. You can’t stay home alone.”

“We always do what you and Noah want. What about me?”

He sighed. “Jess, I love you. But sometimes I wanna do stuff without you. You need to find your own friends.”

That stung more than I wanted to admit.

The doorbell rang, and Noah walked in with his usual smirk.

“Sup.”

“Jess, get your shoes on,” Jackson ordered.

“She’s coming too?” Noah asked.

“Yeah. Mom’s at work. I’m babysitting.”

“Babysitting?” I snapped. “We’re the same age! You’re not babysitting me.”

“I’m twelve minutes older,” Jackson shot back.

Noah snickered. “She’s definitely acting like the baby.”

I stormed off to grab my shoes, but I froze halfway up the stairs when I heard Noah’s voice:

“Man, your sister’s such a brat. Wish she didn’t have to tag along.”

Jackson’s answer was the knife that cut deepest. “Tell me about it.”

At the theater, I tried to forget. “Jax, can we get popcorn? With extra butter?”

Noah raised his brows. “Do you really need the extra butter?”

I clenched my fists. “Yes. I like it that way.”

Jackson slipped me a couple of bills. “Get your own small one.”

I headed for the snack line, and that’s when I heard them again.

“She always has to be eating,” Noah muttered.

“Yeah,” Jackson said with a low laugh. “Sometimes it’s embarrassing to be seen with her.”

The words hit harder than any punch. My own twin—my best friend—was embarrassed of me.

“Hey, it’s your turn,” a girl behind me said gently.

I shook my head. “Changed my mind.”

She frowned. “You okay?”

“No,” I whispered. “I think I lost my best friend.”

She studied me, then said, “I’m Mariah. We’re in the same class, right? You’re Jessa. Jackson’s twin.”

“Yeah.”

“What movie are you supposed to be seeing?”

“Some superhero thing.”

Mariah smirked. “Ditch it. Come with me instead. There’s a new comedy. Way cuter lead actor.”

Before I could decide, Jackson and Noah appeared.

“Jess, what’s taking so long?” Jackson demanded. “Oh, hey, Mariah.”

Mariah smiled sweetly. “Hi. Jessa and I are seeing the comedy instead.”

Jackson shrugged. “Fine. Meet us in the lobby after.”

As he and Noah disappeared, Mariah tugged me toward her theater.

“Come on. You need a laugh.”

I glanced back one last time at my brother’s retreating figure.

He stole my best friend, I thought. And he’s never giving him back.

Three Years Later

Thirteen hit me hard. My body changed in ways I didn’t ask for. I wasn’t the chubby little girl anymore—I had curves. Breasts too big for my age. Hips that didn’t match the other girls at school.

Mom always said, Girls built like us need to cover up. Layers make you look thinner.

So I wore baggy shirts. Oversized hoodies. Clothes that swallowed me whole. It didn’t matter. The teasing still came.

“Jess, you’re wearing that?” Jackson asked one morning, eyeing my loose shirt.

“It’s comfortable.”

“It’s a tent.” He rolled his eyes and left.

Mom kissed my cheek. “Ignore him. He doesn’t understand what it’s like for girls like us.”

At school, the comments started before I even reached the doors.

“The circus is in town!”

“Yeah, they brought the whale exhibit!”

My stomach dropped when I saw where it came from—Jackson and Noah, flanked by their football buddies, all laughing.

“Nice shirt, Jess,” Noah snorted. “They only had tent size left?”

“Shut up, Noah.”

Jackson smirked. “Told you it was too big.”

“Perfect for hiding that fat ass,” Noah added, sending the group into hysterics.

I turned away, pretending I couldn’t hear. But their laughter followed me.

By the time I reached my locker, my hands were shaking. I tugged the handle, but it was jammed. Mariah appeared at my side.

“Need help?”

We pulled together until it finally burst open—and trash bags tumbled out, spilling all over the hallway.

A note taped to one read: Got you a new wardrobe.

The roar of laughter around us was deafening.

“Did you do this?” Mariah snapped at Jackson and Noah, who had pushed through the crowd to watch.

Noah grinned. “She wants to dress like a hobo? Why not just give her options?”

Jackson chuckled. “Relax. It’s just a joke.”

Mariah glared at him. “She’s your sister.”

But Jackson only walked away with Noah.

I stared at the trash bag in my hands. For just one second, I wished I could trade places. To be the one laughing, not the one humiliated.

Present Day

Beep. Beep. Beep.

I groaned, slamming my alarm clock. Senior year. My last year in this hellhole.

I’m Jessa. Nobody special. Just the overweight twin sister of Jackson, starting quarterback and golden boy of our high school. The sister his best friend, Noah Carter, has made it his life’s mission to torment.

Once, when I was ten, I thought Noah was cute. That crush didn’t survive the year. Now at eighteen, he’s tall, broad-shouldered, perfect hair, perfect smile. Every girl wants him.

And I can’t stand him.

But he’s always around—because he’s Jackson’s best friend. The boy who stole my brother from me.

I roll out of bed and tug on my armor: jeans, tank top, oversized button-up. The layers hide the body I’ve been told to be ashamed of.

Time to sneak out before Jackson sees me. Before Noah’s voice finds me.

Another day. Another battle.

# Chapter 2

Jessa

I tiptoe down the hallway, holding my breath. If Jackson’s awake, he’ll have some comment locked and loaded about my clothes, my hair, or just… me. I’d rather start the day without it.

Too late. His bedroom door creaks open, and there he is—my twin, my other half, my betrayer—all six feet of cocky quarterback standing in my way.

“Morning, Jess,” he says, eyes flicking over my shirt. “Nice… tent.”

I don’t even answer. I just shoulder past him, my cheeks heating.

“Aw, come on, don’t be so sensitive,” he calls after me.

Sensitive. That’s what he calls me when his words cut deep, like it’s my fault for feeling anything.

By the time I make it to the kitchen, Mom’s already gone. She leaves early most mornings, and I can’t decide if I’m grateful or jealous. Grateful that she doesn’t see me like this, jealous that she never has time for us.

Jackson grabs a protein shake from the fridge and downs it like he’s in some athlete commercial. I butter a piece of toast, trying to look invisible.

And then, of course, the devil himself arrives.

Noah Carter.

He strolls right into our kitchen like he owns it, helmet tucked under his arm, hair still damp from his shower, all six-foot-two of golden-boy arrogance. He’s wearing his jersey, number 14, stretched across broad shoulders like it was custom made for him.

And because I’m apparently a glutton for punishment, my stupid brain notices the curve of his jaw, the way his damp hair curls at the edges, the clean soap-and-sweat smell that clings to him. I hate myself for noticing.

“Morning, sunshine,” he smirks at me.

I roll my eyes. “Don’t call me that.”

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.” His grin widens, like he knows exactly how to get under my skin.

Jackson laughs and bumps fists with him. “Ignore her, bro. Ready for practice?”

“Always,” Noah says. He glances at my toast, eyebrows lifting. “Extra butter again?”

I slam the knife down. “Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

Jackson snorts. “Don’t mind him, Jess.”

But I mind. God, I mind so much.

The two of them head out to the truck, leaving me with a cold piece of toast and the familiar ache in my chest. It’s the same ache I’ve had since I was ten years old.

The ache of realizing my twin—my best friend—chose someone else.

At school, it doesn’t get better. It never does.

The minute I step into the hallway, eyes flick my way. Whispers. Snickers. The same crap I’ve been hearing since middle school.

“Damn, she’s bigger than the linebackers.”

“Bet she eats more than the team.”

I keep walking, head down, pretending the words don’t stab me. But they do. Every single one leaves another scar I can’t cover with oversized clothes.

Jackson doesn’t notice, or maybe he does and just doesn’t care. He’s too busy soaking in the glory of being the starting quarterback. Too busy laughing with Noah and the rest of the team.

Noah. Always Noah.

The worst part is that when he laughs, it’s this deep, warm sound that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When he smiles, girls melt into puddles. And when his hazel eyes catch the light, they almost glow.

I hate that I’ve noticed all of that.

I hate that part of me gets why the entire female population of Crestwood High would kill for a chance with him.

I hate that part of me, some twisted little part buried deep down, remembers what it felt like to have a crush on him before he turned into my tormentor.

Mariah finds me by my locker. Thank God for her. She’s the one good thing that came out of all this—the girl who saw me breaking at the movies three years ago and decided not to let me stand alone.

“You look like you’re ready to murder someone,” she says, tucking a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear.

“Noah,” I mutter. “As usual.”

She makes a face. “Ugh. You’d think after all these years he’d get bored.”

“He doesn’t. It’s like tormenting me is his favorite sport, right after football.”

Mariah sighs. “Well, senior year, right? Almost done.”

Almost. But almost feels like forever.

Lunch is the worst. Always has been.

I sit with Mariah at the edge of the cafeteria, away from the football table. But no matter how far away I am, Noah still finds me with his eyes. I feel them, sharp as daggers, hot as a spotlight.

Today’s no different. I’m halfway through my sandwich when I hear him across the room.

“Hey, Jackson! Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

Laughter erupts from the table. Jackson doesn’t defend me. He never does.

I keep my head down, cheeks burning, praying no one else joins in. But of course they do.

“She could be the team mascot,” someone says. “Put her in pads, she’ll bulldoze the defense!”

The guys howl with laughter.

Mariah leans across the table, her eyes flashing. “Ignore them. They’re idiots.”

But ignoring doesn’t make it stop.

I grip my sandwich so tightly my knuckles turn white. In my head, I imagine standing up, marching over there, and telling Noah exactly what he is—a bully. A coward. A pathetic jerk who gets off on tearing me down.

But I don’t move.

Because I know what would happen if I did. He’d smirk. He’d say something sharper. And Jackson would laugh right alongside him.

Just like always.

That night, lying in bed, I stare at the ceiling.

This is my last year. One more year of Noah Carter. One more year of Jackson pretending I don’t exist except when it’s convenient. One more year of being “the fat twin,” the joke, the nobody.

After graduation, I’ll be free. College will be my reset button. Nobody will know me as Jackson’s sister or Noah’s favorite target. Nobody will remember the locker full of trash bags or the jokes about butter.

It’ll just be me.

But even as I tell myself that, my brain betrays me. Because it’s not Noah’s insults that replay behind my eyes. It’s his face. His stupidly perfect, sharp-jawed, broad-shouldered, movie-star face.

And I hate myself for it.

The next morning, the cycle repeats. Jackson teasing, Mom absent, me shrinking into myself.

But when Noah shows up, there’s a shift. Not big, not obvious—just a flicker.

He catches me staring.

I don’t mean to. Honest. I’m just zoning out, and my gaze lands on him, on the way his T-shirt stretches across his chest, on the strong line of his throat as he tilts his head back to laugh at something Jackson says.

And then his hazel eyes lock on mine.

For a second, I can’t breathe.

There’s no smirk, no insult, no sharp edge. Just Noah looking at me like… like he sees me.

Then he blinks, and it’s gone. Replaced by the same cocky grin I know too well.

“Like what you see, Sunshine?”

My face burns. “In your dreams.”

But that flicker stays with me all day.

And it terrifies me more than all his insults combined. Because what if—just what if—the boy who’s made my life hell for years is the one I can’t stop noticing?

What if the one I hate most is the one I’m secretly drawn to? And what if he knows it?

# Chapter 3

Noah

Most people think I’ve got it easy.

They see the jersey, the captain’s armband, the girls who slide notes into my locker, the teachers who cut me slack because I’m “leading the team this season.” They see the highlight reels, the touchdowns, the swagger.

And yeah, I play into it. Why wouldn’t I? That image has kept me on top since freshman year.

But what they don’t see—the part I’d never admit out loud—is that the best part of my day isn’t the touchdowns. It’s not the cheers, or even the wins.

It’s Jessa Lombardi’s face when I get under her skin.

I shouldn’t find it that entertaining. She’s Jackson’s twin, for one. Which means technically, she’s off-limits. But God, she makes it too easy. The way her cheeks flush, the way she slams things down or throws out these sharp little comebacks—Jessa’s like one giant exposed nerve. Sensitive as hell.

And I like testing how far I can push before she snaps.

Take this morning, for example.

Jackson and I were heading to practice, but I swung by his place first. Walking into their kitchen always feels… weird. I don’t know why. Maybe because I can practically feel how much Jessa doesn’t want me there.

She was standing at the counter, spreading butter on toast like it had personally offended her. Oversized T-shirt, messy hair, bare feet curling against the tile. For a second, I almost didn’t say anything.

Almost.

“Morning, sunshine,” I tossed out, leaning in the doorway.

The way her shoulders stiffened—it was instant gratification. Like watching a fire catch.

“Don’t call me that,” she muttered, eyes on her plate.

“What? Thought you’d like a nickname.”

She rolled her eyes so hard I swear I heard them click.

Jackson laughed, completely oblivious. “Ignore her, bro.”

I didn’t ignore her, of course. Couldn’t. I never do. Instead, I spotted the toast and couldn’t resist. “Extra butter again?”

She slammed the knife down like she wanted to stab me with it.

“Seriously? Do you ever get tired of commenting on what I eat?”

And just like that, my day was made. That flare of anger in her eyes, the way her voice cracked on ever. She didn’t realize it, but she was giving me exactly what I wanted.

Attention.

Here’s the thing: Jessa doesn’t understand me. She thinks I pick on her just to be a jerk, or because I’ve got nothing better to do. But the truth? It’s not that simple.

I notice her.

More than I should.

And noticing her—really noticing her—is dangerous.

Because Jessa’s not like the other girls who throw themselves at me. She doesn’t giggle when I walk by or bat her lashes hoping I’ll toss her a grin. She doesn’t want anything from me.

Except maybe for me to disappear.

And that makes me want to poke, prod, irritate. It makes me want her to look at me, even if it’s with fire in her eyes. Because when she’s angry at me, at least she’s seeing me.

At school, it’s even better.

In the cafeteria, Jackson and I had the whole team cracking up over stupid inside jokes when I spotted her sitting with Mariah. Always the far table, always head down, like she’s hoping to disappear.

But I don’t let her disappear.

“Hey, Jackson!” I yelled across the room. “Better hide your food or Jess will eat it all before you blink.”

The table erupted. Perfect.

I caught the way her shoulders hunched, the way her hand froze halfway to her mouth. She didn’t look up, but I knew she heard me. Knew she felt the sting.

And yeah, maybe that makes me an asshole. But there’s something about her silence that gets to me. Like she’s holding all this emotion inside, and I’m the only one who knows how to drag it out of her.

Jackson doesn’t get it. To him, Jessa’s just… Jessa. His twin, his shadow, the sister he doesn’t think twice about. He doesn’t notice the way she winces when people whisper, or the way she pulls her hoodie tighter like armor.

But I do.

I see it.

And sometimes I wonder if that’s why I keep poking—because if I don’t, maybe no one would notice her at all.

Practice that afternoon should’ve wiped Jessa from my brain. It usually does. Once I’m on the field, nothing else matters. The snap of the ball, the crunch of pads, the roar of the guys—it drowns everything out.

But not today.

Today, when I closed my eyes, all I saw was the way she glared at me over her toast, cheeks flushed, eyes flashing.

And then—God help me—the way her gaze flickered over me. She thought she was subtle, but I caught it. The way her eyes lingered on my shoulders, my chest.

She thinks I don’t notice, but I do.

And that thought sticks with me longer than I’d like.

That night, lying in bed, I try to tell myself it’s nothing. Jessa’s sensitive, that’s all. She reacts to me because I push her buttons. If she didn’t, I’d probably lose interest.

Except… I’m not losing interest.

If anything, I’m hooked.

I want to know how far I can push before she finally snaps. Before she lets me see the fire I know she’s hiding.

I want to know if that fire burns as hot when it’s not anger.

The next morning, I catch her staring again.

She doesn’t realize it—I’m laughing at something Jackson said, tilting my head back, and when I glance over, her eyes are on me. Not in hate. Not in anger. Just… watching.

And for one insane second, it feels like she sees me. Not the quarterback. Not Jackson’s best friend. Not the jerk who won’t leave her alone.

Just me.

Our eyes lock, and the air shifts. She looks caught, like a deer in headlights.

For once, I don’t smirk. For once, I just look back.

But then panic kicks in, and I cover it with a grin. “Like what you see, Sunshine?”

Her face flames. “In your dreams.”

But I heard the hitch in her breath. I saw the way she couldn’t look away fast enough.

And that’s when I know I’m in trouble.

Because tormenting Jessa Lombardi isn’t just a game anymore.

It’s an addiction.

And sooner or later, it’s going to blow up in my face.

# Chapter 4

Noah

The problem with lying to yourself is that eventually, the truth claws its way out.

I’ve been telling myself for years that I bug Jessa because it’s easy. Because she’s reactive, and I like the way she gets flustered. That’s it. Simple.

But it’s not.

If I’m honest—and I almost never am, even in my own head—it started way before she became “sensitive Jessa.”

It started in middle school.

Back then, Jessa was different. Not unrecognizable—she still had the dark eyes, the messy hair, the sharp tongue—but she laughed more. She’d shoot water through her teeth at Jackson during lunch, or race us to the corner store after practice and somehow always win, even though her legs were half the size of ours.

She wasn’t invisible back then. She didn’t try to be.

I noticed her before I even realized I was noticing her. The way her grin curved higher on the right side. The way she’d wrinkle her nose when she concentrated. The way she never backed down, even when she should have.

I liked it.

Too much.

And that scared the hell out of me.

Because she was Jackson’s twin. And Jackson’s my guy—my quarterback, my brother from another mother. There’s an unspoken rule: sisters are off-limits. Period.

So instead of admitting I was drawn to her, I started pushing her away. Teasing, needling, whatever you want to call it. It was easier to play the jerk than to let anyone—including her—guess how I actually felt.

And over the years, that mask stuck.

Now everyone, including Jessa, believes I really am that guy. The one who points out her extra butter, or makes cracks in the cafeteria.

But underneath it? Every time I say something, every time I watch her react, there’s this other layer.

I’m watching her mouth.

I’m watching her eyes.

I’m thinking things I shouldn’t think.

Last week was the worst.

We were at Jackson’s, sprawled on the couch, watching film. Jessa came in with a bowl of popcorn, pretending she didn’t care if we ate it all. She sat on the floor, leaning against the coffee table, hoodie sleeves covering her hands.

And when she laughed—actually laughed at some dumb commentary on TV—it hit me like a helmet to the ribs.

I hadn’t heard that laugh in a long time.

It wasn’t sharp or defensive. It wasn’t trying to hide. It was just… real.

I couldn’t stop staring.

And then she glanced up, caught me looking, and everything inside me knotted tight. Because for a second, I swear she knew.

Knew that I’d been watching her.

Knew that maybe, underneath all the teasing, I wanted her.

The worst part?

I don’t want to stop.

I tell myself I should. That she deserves better than being some secret I bury under sarcasm. That Jackson would kill me if he knew.

But then she glares at me across the table, or snaps back with some fiery retort, and it’s like gasoline on a match. I can’t quit.

It’s like the closer I get to the edge, the more I want to see what happens if I jump.

What happens if I stop hiding behind jokes and just say it.

That I like the way she looks in oversized T-shirts. That I notice how she tucks her hair behind her ear when she’s nervous. That I’ve thought about what her mouth would feel like against mine more times than I can admit.

That the reason I agitate her isn’t because she’s sensitive.

It’s because she makes me feel exposed.

And the only way I know how to handle it is to make her feel the same.

Lying here now, staring at the ceiling in the dark, I know I’m screwed.

Because sooner or later, I won’t be able to keep pretending.

And when that happens, everything—my friendship with Jackson, the team, the fragile balance we’ve all built—could go up in flames.

But the truth?

If it means Jessa finally sees me the way I see her…

I might just light the match myself.

Hey everyone! I wanted to share my personal advice for anyone preparing for the NCLEX — especially if you’re short on time or tend to procrastinate like I did.

I was a major procrastinator all through nursing school. I always told myself I’d start early… but somehow ended up leaving things until the last minute. After graduating in August 2025, I decided to take a break and completely forget about the NCLEX for a while. Fast forward — I got a job offer and suddenly realized I had only 2 weeks to study before taking the exam.

I panicked at first, but with focus and consistency, I managed to pass at 85 questions in about 3 hours! 🙌

Here’s exactly what worked for me 👇

⸻

🧠 NCLEX Tips That Helped Me Pass

1. Mark Klimek Lectures (1–12)
I finished all the lectures in 5 days. I listened to each one carefully, wrote everything down, and made sure I understood the concepts before moving on.
➡️ I actually had around 10 questions on the NCLEX that came directly from what Mark teaches — so it’s worth it!

⸻

2. UWorld — 9 Days of Practice Questions
I studied 8–10 hours a day, finished about 70% of the QBank, and averaged around 75%.
	•	I started doing mixed questions but later switched to completing them by section, which helped me focus better on each topic.
	•	I read every rationale (even the ones I got right) and took notes on things I didn’t fully understand.
	•	If you’re a visual learner — use imagery! For example, imagine a “Cushing Man” when studying Cushing’s syndrome so you can visualize it during the test.

⸻

3. Change Up Your Study Environment
Studying in the same place all day can burn you out. I rotated between different areas — coffee shops, libraries, even the park — and it really helped me stay focused and refreshed.

⸻

4. Be a Critical Thinker, Not a Memorizer
The NCLEX isn’t just about facts — it’s about safety and reasoning.
Know your systems and what happens when something goes wrong.
If you understand why something happens and what the body will do in response, you can handle any question they throw at you — even ones you’ve never seen before.

⸻

5. Believe in Yourself — Seriously! 💪
Confidence goes a long way. Every day I told myself:

“I’m smart. I’m capable. I will pass the NCLEX.”

Those affirmations helped me push through anxiety and stay positive.

⸻

6. Day of the Exam
	•	Eat a light breakfast 🥣
	•	Wear comfy clothes
	•	Take deep breaths — between questions if you need to
	•	Remember: one question at a time!

⸻

7. After the Exam — Let It Go
I know it’s hard not to overthink it, but once it’s done, it’s out of your hands.
Go do something fun! Treat yourself — you’ve come so far already. Whether you pass or not, it’s not the end of your journey. You’re still going to be an amazing nurse. 🌟

⸻

If you’re reading this and feeling anxious or behind — trust me, you’ve got this. Even if you only have two weeks, you can still pass if you study smart, stay focused, and believe in yourself.

Good luck future nurses! You’ve got this 💙🩺

Yes I’m aware of the side effects of adderall. I did lose weight initially. However, I’m a huge gym girly. I’ve always prioritized my nutrition. Gained the weight back. Put on good muscle. Appetite suppression is not much of an issue. And when it is, I still have all three meals.

I’m currently struggling with appetite and eating and I know WHY. But can’t necessarily do much about it right now.
I work full time. I went from doing the gym 4-5x a week, eating as well as possible, limiting caffeine intake to gym time only. 
I still work full time but I’m back in school full time as well. Gym time is cut back to 1-3x a week. Consuming more caffeine, coffee in the AM and PM. Obviously, not sleeping as well either. But doing my best. 
Except, my appetite is gone. And NOT on my meds either. I can barely get myself to eat. In fact, being on my adderall has gotten me to eat better than being off. I also barely take my adderall on the weekends. 
Also, in the limited free time I have, I would rather die than grocery shop and meal prep. I would rather die than pull out a pan and turn on the stove top. I’ve been eating out but I can barely stand eating that and it’s only because the food is prepared. I don’t crave anything. Keep in mind, my adderall has long taken its course and I don’t always take my second dose. I think it’s related to stress and feeling depressed. Also, food is just so lame.

I need tips and tricks please! Shortcut ideas for things you have done, what your experience has been, how you got your appetite to come back, what you did for food, motivations for meal prep, etc.

Please do not critique me on prioritizing my mental and physical health. I actively am. I follow fairly strict rules so that I don’t have to give up the gym. Bedtime no later than midnight. No more than two cups of coffee. My screen time is 2 hrs a day. No social media except Reddit on the weekends. (I literally downloaded reddit to visit this subreddit today.) I walk my dog an hour a day. Etc etc etc. I push myself to eat as much as possible. It’s just my appetite is getting in the way. 

Ps. I already drink protein drinks. Please don’t suggest that.

Within a week, you'll be leaving the desk for Tepper to pursue the highest of all business honors: your M.B.A. Your Sr Manager told you that ""an MBA is just a waste of time"" and your Analyst said ""they wouldn't waste $300k on a two-year party"", but you know better. You're going to be around some of the top minds in business, learning, growing and pursuing a career in Investment Banking - safe to say, they're just jealous.

The week before your program starts, you are in Cancun with about half of your incoming class. You look to the smokeshows in skimpy bikinis to your left and right. They... don't go to school with you, but the girls who do aren't half bad looking either. As ""Pepas"" plays for the 13th time, you take another shot with Arjun, who is in your cohort and smile - this is going to be a blast. 

Fast forward a few months, and you are midway through your core curriculum. You know which toilet has a whobbly door in the state-of-the-art Quad, arguably the newest facility among all M.B.A. programs if Columbia indeed loses its accreditation. You didn't imagine that you could be working 80+ hours a week during your MBA, but between classes, finishing group work for your lazy teammates, recruiting events, and networking events that aren't mandatory but feel like they are, you're pretty damn tired. But hey, at least a good chunk of it is drinking with your classmates. It's amazing that this counts as career growth, you think to yourself as you sign up for your 44th happy hour of the semester. 

Your NYC IB trek was awesome. Everyone keeps talking about culture, collaboration, and collegial to justify their choice of repaying student debt faster than peers, and you can just regurgitate those 3 words back during the Zoom coffee chat. Hearing a Director saying ""fe-NAAN-s"" 7 times during an office visit made you want to get a piece of it. Hitting Times Square in business formal with a hiking backpack at 8:51pm made you feel like the world is all yours. You walked into Ootoya with Arjun and had a $41 chicken over rice, yet you still smiled after finding out you didn't need to tip. 

Going through your first set of finals, you realize why MBA Associates caught a lot of flak. It's literally impossible to fail these tests, you think to yourself as you ChatGPT another answer to your accounting exam. Sure, some of your classmates might fail, but those are the nepo-babies who didn't even try. The ""top minds in business"" thought you had before you started the program has all but evaporated from your lexicon at this point. 

After securing a solid internship at a local M&A shop specializing in metal, HVAC, and pizzeria for the summer, you've returned for your second-year of the program. They needed someone to start immediately, so unfortunately they weren't able to give you a return offer. It seems a bit silly that you have to return for this second-year, but you're sure that your elective classes with prestigious, high-regarded professors will be well worth the extra time. 

In meeting with one of those professors, you realize that his thoughts on the MBA are pretty consistent with your Managers and LDP kids. ""I spent my entire career at GS, MS, and Evercore"" he mentions as you chat over coffee, ""and I've never found an MBA who knew as much as someone who stayed on the job for that same amount of time.""

You chuckle nervously at his comment, ""but you think the MBA is worth it, right?""

""Only because we make it out to be bud, only because we make it out to be"", he replies with a grin. 

Thankfully, that professor is something of a dinosaur. He doesn't know what he's really talking about, you say to yourself. You're so close with so many of your classmates who are going to McKinsey, Goldman, Google and other top firms. Those connections will propel you to the top as you head into PE and then entrepreneurship through acquisition in the long run - you know it. 

It's now April of your second-year. Your recruiting journey has largely failed, mostly due to an impending recession and turmoil in the market. ""No shops are willing to hire right now"", your career center rep tells you as you gnaw through your fingernails, ""but someone like you has the perfect resume to head back into corporate - we just received a request to put out this FP&A Sr Analyst role at Genuine Electronics."" 

""Sure, I'll apply"", you say in a daze. Well, at least you'll be headed to Miami post-graduation for one last hurrah with your classmates. 

As you land in Miami, you can't help but reminisce on the last few years. You've made countless friends, learned that what one business school professor teaches another will contradict, and have destroyed 85% of your liver. You push that thought to the back of your mind and head to Club Space for a final 7am night with your classmates. As you hit the dance floor, your phone rings, notifying you that your contract for a FP&A Sr Analyst role at Genuine Electronics is available for signing. You hold up your drink, and as the strobe lights hit it in just the right way you look at your best bud Arjun and smile: The Tepper M.B.A. is paradise.

1oduv60,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ill_Answer8502/comments/1oduv60/moja_przygoda/,Moja przygoda,"The hardest part is starting, even if I share it here, I don't know if anyone will read it. You have so many ideas on how to begin, and sometimes—like today—you don't even know where to begin. The beginning? But where exactly is that beginning? Maybe with how my mom and I rescued four wonderful animals—two dogs and two kittens, who now live together in peace. Most people would probably think that's boring. But what if I told the story of being robbed—through my own stupidity and exhaustion? Oh, tragedies always sell better, right? So here's my little tragedy that befell my mom and me.

This story begins with the desire to escape. To escape from a place that reminded us of our deceased dad—a wonderful man, a loving husband, and a supporter until the end. My parents lived in Crete, Greece. A fairytale place… as long as my dad was alive. When he passed away, the fairytale ended. Nothing kept us there anymore, so we decided to sell the house. Unfortunately, the process dragged on endlessly. Meanwhile, my mother was wondering where she could settle. I had previously lived in Denmark—until my father's death—and that was the country I suggested. Listening to my stories about Denmark, my mother enthusiastically and hopefully declared that a new adventure awaited us there. We began preparing to move and explore the new place. The animals were vaccinated and prepared for travel, and we were just waiting for the house sales agreement to be signed. We even managed to find a buyer surprisingly quickly, but the house transfer process itself dragged on for almost a year.

Finally, the documents were signed. It was time to find a transport that would take not only our belongings but also us and our beloved animals.

 

**July 15th – July 23rd**

Everything started well. I received word from the notary that we would be signing the house sales agreement on July 18th – finally! After so many months, we were officially ending this phase of our lives. However, joy quickly mixed with pressure. The new owner was impatient – ​​he wanted to move in as early as August. This meant I urgently needed to find transport for us, our belongings, and our animals. I called every company I could, but I was met with rejection: ""We don't transport animals"" or ""We don't transport passengers, only cargo."" I even tried popular classifieds websites, but the story repeated itself – everyone only wanted goods, not people.

Finally, one person – let's call her Ms. Grażyna – responded. She said that transporting dogs might be a problem, but she didn't rule it out. This gave me hope. In subsequent conversations, she sounded increasingly convincing – she claimed that if the load exceeded 1,500 kg, two vans or a van with a trailer would be necessary. Ultimately, I decided that a van with a trailer would be enough. I paid 1,500 euros in advance, purchased special cargo for animals, as Mrs. Grażyna had requested, and purchased ferry tickets—with a cabin adapted for animals. Tired but happy, I spent the next few days packing the rest of my belongings. We set the departure date for July 28th—that's when we were all supposed to sail together.

**July 27**

The day started unexpectedly early. At 6:31 a.m., the driver—let's call him Mr. Janusz. The voice on the other end was strained: ""My front left tire blew out. Someone probably punctured it during the night.""

My mom and I were surprised he showed up a day early, but we took it as a good sign—maybe we'd get through the move faster. Mom was packing the last of our things, and I frantically searched for help with the car repair. Finally, Mr. Janusz announced he'd take care of everything himself.

At 10:24 a.m., he called again. ""The car's fixed, I'm on my way,"" he said, his tone brimming with exhaustion but also confidence.

Packing began at high noon, in the unbearable heat. From 12:00 to 4:00 p.m., the heat was unbearable. Sweat poured down our backs, and the air was heavy as lead. I felt a sun-induced headache slowly spreading across my temples, but I gritted my teeth—just to finish. During the loading, Mr. Janusz repeatedly reiterated that the load was very heavy, but ultimately assured me that ""he could handle it."" We weren't familiar with the technical details, so we trusted his experience and professionalism.

However, we couldn't load everything—some of our belongings had to be left behind in Crete. And then he said a sentence that drove me to my knees:

""Ladies, you're not coming with me. There's no room."" We froze. Just the day before, we'd agreed to go together—my mother, the dogs, and the cats. Everything had been planned so well. Now, everything fell apart in an instant.

Panicked, we started looking for an alternative. We had to find transportation for ourselves and the animals—immediately. Time was running out, and one question was racing through my mind: what now? I asked Mr. Janusz if we could pay 1,000 euros now, and the remaining 2,000 euros after the load was delivered to Denmark. I explained that we now had to use the money intended for the driver to arrange our transport. To my surprise, he agreed.

He even helped us temporarily – he offered a flight to Denmark for 1,900 euros, but it quickly became clear that this was impossible. We couldn't fly without luggage. We had our documents, personal belongings, and, above all, our animals. Tired, sweaty, and resigned, we watched the bus depart. Inside – our memories, our life's work, traces of our father. Back then, we still believed we'd see it all again in a few days. We didn't know this was just the beginning of the nightmare.

28/07

At 9:38 a.m., Mr. Janusz called. His voice was strained, clipped. ""Another tire blew out. This time, the right front tire. The load is too heavy.""

I froze. This was the second tire in two days. Disturbing thoughts began to swirl in my head, but I tried to push them aside—we couldn't afford to panic. Meanwhile, my mother, my mother's Greek friend, and I continued our frantic search for transportation. We explored every option—planes, buses, even special taxis for animals—but everything ended in rejection. We could fly without luggage, but how could we leave our documents? It was out of the question.

In desperation, my mother called her friend Dorota from France. Together we tried to come up with a solution, but neither of us had any ideas. Time flew by. The heat was becoming unbearable, and the air in the house felt as thick as an oven. I felt tension tighten in my stomach.

I told my mother, ""The most important thing is that we get off the island. Then we'll figure something out.""

She looked at me with tired but determined eyes. She nodded. The problem, however, was how to get from our village to Heraklion. Luckily, the new owner of the house, even though he'd just bought it, agreed to drive us there. As a token of gratitude, we paid for his gas.

At 3:43 PM, a message arrived from Ms. Grażyna: ""The car and trailer were weighed in the port – 2.8 tons. That's 1.5 tons more than before."" I no longer had the strength to react. In my haste, I ignored the email.

That day, at 9:00 PM, we were supposed to catch the ferry. Packed, exhausted, but full of hope that the stress was over – we made it just in time. Before boarding the ferry, my mother noticed Mr. Janusz. He was standing with a Greek man, chatting. She went to him because the day before, he'd mentioned that a friend of his wanted to sell the car. We were both interested, so she wanted to know more. Mr. Janusz assured me that the car was in excellent condition and that all that was needed was a document confirming that my mother had power of attorney. The Greek man he spoke with quickly explained that it wasn't that simple – a full re-registration procedure would be necessary, which takes at least a day. The document Mr. Janusz mentioned would have no legal validity. My mother, knowing a little Greek, understood the situation and, with a smile and a hint of disappointment, thanked both men.

Finally, Mr. Janusz showed us a document showing the weight of 3 tons. ""With the driver, it's 3 tons, without me, 2.9 tons,"" he explained. He added that because of this excess weight, we had to cover the additional fuel costs. That evening, as we sat on the ferry, my mother was quiet. She stared out to sea, as if to leave all the chaos there. I stared at the dark waves and tried to convince myself that these were just temporary difficulties, that everything would work out. I truly believed it back then.

July 29

The morning greeted us with weary light and heavy air. At 6:15 a.m., the ferry reached Athens, at the port of Piraeus. There was no time to catch our breath—we immediately started looking for new transportation. At 8:01 a.m., Mr. Janusz called. He sounded nervous, as if he were looking for someone to blame. ""The trailer broke down—it stopped at the intersection and wouldn't move. The load was too heavy. It's your fault. I left 22 packages behind."" At that moment, I wanted to scream, but I was too tired to do so. Only one thing was pulsing in my head: to stay calm.

I apologized to him, even though it wasn't our fault. I tempered my emotions so the situation wouldn't spiral out of control. Little did I know then that this ""trailer"" would be the beginning of a long nightmare. Meanwhile, my mother and I frantically tried to organize anything to take us and the animals onward. Even the pet taxis refused. Time was running out—we had to catch the next ferry at 7:00 PM from Patras to Ancona. At 9:57 AM, a text arrived from Mr. Janusz: ""Do you have a car yet? There's a friend in Athens who runs a used car dealership. He sells cheaply."" He gave me his phone number. I texted, called—nothing. It wasn't until a few hours later, around 1:00 PM, that I got the address. My mother went there alone, even though the sun was beating down mercilessly.

At 1:12 PM, she returned. She was flushed with heat, sweating, and carrying a bottle of water.

""There's nothing there,"" she said simply. ""No dealership, no cars."" But I saw a glint in her eyes—she wasn't giving up. ""I found a ride. He'll be there to pick us up any minute.""

At 2:36 PM, the taxi driver showed up. When he saw our dogs and cats, he first clutched his head, but after a moment, he just sighed. ""Okay, we'll manage.""

He was tired, but honest. We set off towards Patras, and the drive seemed to drag on forever.

At 5:00 PM, we arrived. The ride cost 450 euros. We had no choice—we paid, knowing that every hour of delay could mean losing everything. I ran to buy ferry tickets. I had to pay extra for a cabin where pets were allowed. 700 euros. I felt my wallet getting lighter and my insides getting emptier.

At 10:00 PM, we took the ferry to Ancona. The sea was calm, but my mind was racing. My mother called Dorota, texted her—we'd arranged for Dorota to come from France to Milan and meet there. That evening, in the middle of the sea, between Greece and Italy, I thought for the first time that maybe it wasn't a coincidence at all. That something was starting to stink about this story—and it wasn't just the flat tires anymore.

 **July 30**

The ferry rocked gently, as if trying to lull us to sleep. Through the cabin window, we could see the milky sea, slowly gaining color with the dawn. There was something strangely peaceful about it, like the calm before a storm. Mom sat beside us, cuddling one of the dogs. The cats were asleep in their carriers, as tired as we were. I felt salt on my lips, in my throat, and on my hands—not only from the sea, but also from the tears that wouldn't even fall. As we approached Ancona, we began to seek help from the crew. We asked for any contact information, anyone who could take us to Milan. The ferryman, an older Italian with a gentle gaze, promised to look around. A few hours later, he brought word: he'd found someone. The price—850 euros. We had no choice.

At 2:06 PM, I received an email from Grażyna. The ""damage"" estimate – 850 euros for the destroyed trailer. I stared at my phone screen, and the letters were starting to blur. I felt something inside me break. I was still on the road, still unsure about our belongings, and I was already about to pay for their mistakes.

That evening, at 7:23 PM, I texted Dorota. ""We're already in Ancona. We're waiting for a taxi."" In response: ""Hang in there. I'll be waiting for you in Milan.""

Around 10:00 PM, we set off. Italian roads at that hour smelled of hot asphalt and dust. The car sped through the night, headlights flashing past us like sparks, and the dogs curled up in the backseat. Mom dozed, holding my hand, like she did when I was a child and afraid of thunderstorms.

At 3:33 AM, we arrived at the hotel in Milan. Dorota was already there. When she opened the door for us, my mother simply embraced her—for a long time, without words, as if to release all the stress, fear, and exhaustion of the past few days with a single embrace.

In the morning, at 9:07 a.m., there were tears, smiles, and a quiet breakfast in the small hotel dining room, smelling of coffee. For the first time in weeks, I felt a kind of relief. But I knew this was just a break, not the end.

At 10:53 a.m., we set off again—towards Germany. Mountain landscapes flashed through the car windows, and I thought about how surreal this journey had been. Two dogs, two cats, three women, and thousands of kilometers behind us.

Around 6:00 p.m., we stopped for the night. We finally caught our breath. I sat on the bed with my phone, looking for someone to pick up our packages. We succeeded. Someone agreed to secure them.

That was the first small glimmer of hope. That same day, I received a message telling me exactly where Janusz had left our things. I felt angry, but also helpless—we were hundreds of kilometers away.

The rescue operation took me days. It wasn't until August 7th that I managed to transport the packages to a safe place. I paid €223.20 to the person who took them.

At 7:17 PM, Ms. Grażyna again requested a transfer. I replied at 7:55 PM: ""The money will be ready on the spot."" I also wrote about problems with my mother's account—that it had a daily withdrawal limit, that we weren't doing it on purpose. The response was silence. But I sensed one thing from the tone of the earlier messages: indifference. That evening, for the first time, I realized that the people we trusted never had good intentions towards us.

**August 1**

In the morning, I woke up to the sound of notifications. Ms. Grażyna was texting again—increasingly insisting that we pay by bank transfer. I sensed she was starting to lose patience, but I still believed she was simply stressed about the situation. I was at the end of my rope myself.

My phone was failing more and more frequently. The battery was draining at an alarming rate, and calls were cutting off mid-sentence. I thought it was from constant use, but in the back of my mind, I felt a twinge of anxiety. Finally, a friend who had access to my number texted me that I was running low on credit—he topped up my account so I could stay connected. This gesture, small and quiet, meant a lot back then.

At 3:59 PM, a text arrived from Ms. Grażyna. ""Ms. Agata, Mr. Janusz had an accident last night.""

I froze. I read it several times, as if my brain refused to accept the meaning of the words. In an instant, I felt something strange—a mixture of shock, sympathy, and fear. Not anger, not suspicion, just genuine sadness. No matter how difficult the situation was for us—an accident is a tragedy. I immediately wrote that I hoped nothing serious had happened to him. I received no reply.

Ms. Grażyna repeated the question in subsequent messages: ""Did you receive my email with the estimate?"" I replied that I had, and that we had the cash ready. I was still willing to pay, as long as everything was resolved honestly.

My mother, however, was uneasy. She sat down next to me and said quietly,

""You know, I'd like to at least see our things before we pay. It's not about the money... I'm afraid that something of Dad's mementos might have been damaged."" I listened to her and felt she was right. I knew that even if our things were damaged, we would have paid. We just wanted to know they were safe.

That evening, when the emotions had subsided a bit, I remembered the website I'd used to search for transportation. I wanted to check if Ms. Grażyna had ever officially submitted an offer there. Not to prove anything—I just wanted to be fair. I still thought well of her. She and Mr. Janusz seemed like ordinary, helpful people back then, just beset by an unfortunate chain of events. I believed them. I truly did.

**August 2nd**

We arrived at our destination late in the afternoon. It was hot, the air stagnant, as if even it no longer had the strength to move. I stepped out of the car as if in a trance—exhaustion, stress, and sleepless nights had taken their toll. I felt as if I hadn't had a body for weeks, just a stiff shell that somehow still functioned.

Grażyna kept texting. More messages, reminders, requests for transfers. It felt more and more like pressure, not a conversation. I replied calmly: ""The cash is ready. We'll pay when we meet there."" But with each passing day, her tone became drier, colder.

That was the first time I felt something I hadn't wanted to admit before—fear. Not the kind that paralyzes, but the quiet fear that warns: something's not right.

Mom and I talked for a long time. She told me she was worried that if we paid upfront, we might never see our things. I looked at her, and for the first time, I couldn't calm her down. I started asking friends who had experience in transport what the situation was like. They all said the same thing: never pay in advance unless you can guarantee receipt of the goods. I wanted to believe that Ms. Grażyna was honest, that it was just a misunderstanding. But with each message, that faith weakened.

In the meantime, I contacted a lawyer—not to accuse anyone, but to understand our rights. I wanted to be sure we were acting appropriately.

Someone once said that trust is the most valuable currency. That day, I began to feel like I'd lost almost everything, but what hurt me most was this: that I was starting to lose trust and distrust in people.

And then a message from Ms. Grażyna arrived on WhatsApp. ""You have a lawyer, and you're recording me."" I froze. I didn't have a lawyer. I wasn't recording anyone. I don't know where she got that from. Maybe it was fear? Maybe guilt? Or maybe she was just trying to turn the tables. Looking back on it now, I know that back then I was still trying to believe in good intentions. I thought that if we just stayed calm, everything would be cleared up. But with each passing day, I felt more and more that there was more to it than just coincidence.

I didn't yet know that this wasn't the end of this journey—just another stage in which trust would become the most expensive thing I would pay.

When the emotions began to subside, I thought it was over. That the story with Ms. Grażyna and Mr. Janusz was just a sad chapter in a long journey. For a moment, I truly believed that all I had to do was stop, catch my breath, and let time heal what had happened.

But time doesn't heal everything. Some memories just wait for you to look away for a moment—then they come back, sharper, more painful than before.

Weeks passed. My mother and I were starting to believe that maybe we could simply move on. That even if we didn't get everything back, at least we would regain some peace. But then October arrived. A phone call, a message, a location.

6:10

That day, I received information about our belongings. I turned on the map and froze. The satellite view showed something that looked more like an abandoned yard than a warehouse. Scattered pallets, mud, garbage. I felt something tighten inside me. Mom stood beside me, staring at the screen. ""We're going,"" she said in a tone that brooked no argument.

She was 62 years old, and her eyes held the same twinkle she always had—a mixture of courage and stubbornness.

""Mom, it's thousands of kilometers, and I don't even have a driver's license,"" I tried to explain. She smiled faintly. ""It's nothing. We'll manage. We always manage.""

I couldn't stop her. Maybe I didn't want to. I knew this was more than just a journey to collect our belongings—it was a fight for dignity. For the right not to let anyone make us feel like victims.

We packed up and set off in our little Kia Picanto. Two hearts fueled by pure exhaustion and determination. The journey from Denmark to Poland seemed endless. The cabin smelled of coffee and silence—the heavy silence when you're afraid to say something that might shatter your own hope.

 

**8:10**

We arrived. Tired, but even happy. On the way, I managed to find a transport company – I informed them that there might be problems, even the police, but please be ready. The woman on the other end of the phone had a warm voice. ""Don't worry. We'll be there."" We agreed: pick-up for 330 euros, and then transport from Poland to Denmark for 2,250 euros. Everything was supposed to start on October 9th.

9:10

I was tense from the morning. Mrs. Grażyna knew we'd arrive at 9:00. We just wanted to see our things – make sure they were still there. She agreed, but after a few minutes, she called our lawyer, saying that her lawyer hadn't given her permission to enter.

It was absurd. The police had already informed her that they had no right to keep our things. She had promised to return them as soon as we arrived. And that's exactly what we did – we arrived.

At the given addresses – silence. No one had heard of such a company.

But I wasn't the same person I had been before. Not the one who trusted blindly. I found a public document—an official one from the municipal office—with Mr. Janusz's details and address. I knew that was where we would find them.

When we arrived at their house with the lawyer, Ms. Grażyna paled. Her expression was priceless—a mixture of shock, shame, and anger. She knew there was no turning back.

Finally, she had to show us our belongings. We went together. The police arrived some time later, because, of course, Ms. Grażyna tried to stop the shipment and send back a new shipment. But this time, she failed to intimidate us.

When our belongings finally arrived in Denmark, my mother and I were so exhausted we had no energy left. The very fact that the shipment had arrived at all seemed like a small miracle at the time. However, we didn't have time to check everything right away. Only a few days later, when we were unpacking the boxes, did the truth come out.

My heart sank. My mother's porcelain—smashed. My father's belongings—broken. My porcelain dolls—in pieces. My drawing tablets—vanished. I stood among the boxes, looking at the mess, and felt tears streaming down my cheeks. Not from anger. From grief.

Because how do you explain to someone that it's not the objects that hurt the most, but the memories that lived within them? Each piece of porcelain was like a shard of a former life—a life that could no longer be glued back together.

My mother, the widow of her husband of over 37 years, was robbed of the remnants of his presence. And I—who had always defended Poland and believed it was a country of beautiful people and kind hearts—felt that feeling die within me for a second time.

Maybe we were just unlucky with people. Or maybe there are simply too many ""Janusz and Grażyna"" like this.

Today, October 21st, as I write this, it's still hard for me to believe that all this really happened. But I know one thing—even if the world can be merciless, my mother and I got through it together.

And perhaps this is where our strength lies: that despite pain and disappointment, we still manage to move forward. Because what has survived within us—love, persistence, and hope—is something that can never be taken away from anyone.

Perhaps this is where our strength lies—that despite tragedy, pain, and a sense of injustice, we still manage to see something good. What happened to us was one of the reasons we fled Poland—a place we once loved, but which became a source of fear, disappointment, and sadness. Now, though my mother and I are still recovering—she from the stress that likely caused her to have a minor stroke and lose the sight in one eye, and I from battling negative thoughts and inner hatred—we're trying to find meaning in it all. We're trying not to give up and to believe that even the darkest experiences can bring lessons that we will one day fully understand.

If I had more strength and time, this story could probably have turned out differently, maybe even with a happy ending, because I never pay in advance, but we were against a wall... It turned out the way it did. And although sometimes regret and a sense of loss creep into my heart, I know I have to move forward. We can only learn to move on, with our heads held high.

The only real positive I see in this is that we crossed half of Europe with our four pets—all alive. Every step, every hour spent on the road, every moment of uncertainty reminded me how fragile life is and how much safety and closeness matter. We were deceived, exploited, betrayed by people who should have supported each other because, after all, we are Polish, but despite everything, we survived. Our animals—the little creatures who brought so much joy, affection, and love to our lives—were our anchor, our reason to keep going, to not give up, to never doubt.

I have a wonderful mother, a strong and steadfast woman who, despite pain and fear, still tries to support me. I have extraordinary animals who are now my greatest joy and greatest responsibility. Each one teaches me something about patience, loyalty, and unconditional love. They show me that life, though full of suffering, also brings the most beautiful moments—quiet, everyday moments that fill the heart with peace.

That's why I decided to sell everything that still ties me to that place and the past—I don't want to ever cling to things again and end it all. I want my life to be full of true connections, moments that stay in my heart, not on shelves or in closets. I want to remember what we've been through, not to dwell on the past, but to draw from it the strength and courage to live here and now.

I want every day to remind me that what's invisible to the eye is most precious—love, presence, safety, and peace of mind. I want to surround myself with people who can empathize, who know that life isn't always fair, and who, despite this, don't lose their inherent kindness. I want my decisions and every step I take to be conscious, full of respect for others, filled with gratitude for what I have and for those around me.

Sometimes at night, when I look at our animals sleeping next to their mother, I feel that despite all the hardships, we are in a safe place—a place that is our home, not just physically. And that's what gives me hope. Hope that even after the greatest storm, peace comes. Hope that what we've lost doesn't define us, but only strengthens us. Hope that the feelings we have, the bonds we create, and the love we share are what truly give life meaning.

I want everyone who reads this story to feel even a little of what I felt—that mixture of pain and hope, loss and gratitude. Because sometimes, to see the true beauty of the world, you have to go through hell. This is my little story. Best regards.

There I was: naked, unblinking, alive in a way I haven’t been since I learned to hide. No one has ever seen me this raw, this vulnerable, this terrifyingly true. It triggered the fuck out of me - heart pounding, breath gone, like you’d reached through the paper and cracked my ribs open.  

I sent you words in the aftermath. Fragments of that exposure: the ache, the fear, the electric terror of being known. Then I panicked, erased it all. Deleted my own confession, as if vanishing could rebuild the walls you tore down. But seeing you online since? Your silence slices deeper. Are you ghosting the ghost I became? Or did my vulnerability vanish into your silence?  This isn’t begging. It’s a wound laid bare. Your art didn’t just capture me - it resurrected me, trembling and whole. 

Tell me: What did you see in that exposed soul? 

Coffee to talk it through? 

Another sitting, no hiding? 

Or just this letter, proving I’m still here - flayed, but unbroken?

I, (17F) have a mom (36f) who is a serial cheater. I told my dad something that she did (leave the house for an hour to go hang out with some guy in MY CAR) but she left to go hangout with that guy at night when my dad was gone so I was the one taking care of my siblings (5f, 12m, 16m) and yesterday while my parents were at the store my dad brought it up that the guy she was with was using some sort of scanner on my car (because she told me the dude was) and she called me instantly and asked if I told my dad, and I was confused at first but then she hung up and when they got home she got into a screaming match with me and my dad and saying because of me their marriage is over. 

Later on they had a talk and concluded they’re gonna get divorced (they always say this, never do) and she also told me that she doesn’t trust me anymore because I told my dad what she did. what’s really bothering me however is that she’s now ignoring me, being passive aggressive to me, doesn’t care or ask if I eat, only asked and gave my brothers and my little sister food and is just being really weird and passive aggressive to me. 

It’s making me feel really anxious because I don’t know when the next time she’s gonna explode, and I used to have to constantly walk on eggshells around her but now that’s amplified by 100x. I hate this, my dad and brother told me it’s not my fault she got caught cheating and that she can’t put the blame on me but i still feel super horrible inside and I hate that the new year is starting off like this. 

I’ve never had a good relationship with my mom but I feel like the little progress I’ve made now has completely gone backwards and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared it’s going to affect my schooling (i’m homeschooled) and my life and I really, really need advice. Thank you reddit!

UPDATE 1: I was just eating lunch and I asked if we had coffee creamer (we were out) and my dad told me my mom got some so I thanked her, and she just turned away not looking at me and gave me a thumbs up. I hate this, I hate living here and I hate being here with her.

Tomorrow my dad goes back to work and i’m scared that she’s gonna take her anger out on me and just scream at me nonstop tomorrow and I won’t be able to get any schoolwork done because of her. Idk what to do :(.

EDIT: Just to give some context, my mom has been talking to around 5 different guys right now (that I know of) and has been hanging out with one of them, taking MY car to go meet up with him and I caught her going to a hotel a while back but idk who she was meeting up with then. Ive met 6 of her APS before (some in person, some when she’s on a call) and it makes me so uncomfortable. this has been happening since I was 5 years old and now unfortunately even the rest of my siblings have gone through this (her constantly cheating.)

\-Free/good breakfast so I can have a good meal before my exam (eggs and toast will suffice). 

\-Less noise/quiet. I wanna be able to get a good night's sleep and tend to be sensitive to loud noise.

\-Easy parking

Also, does Embassy Suites have a Starbucks inside it? Google search says it does, but can't find anything about it on their website. Would be great to get coffee before my exam too.

Anyone familiar with either of these? Tru is cheaper, but apparently can be noisy so I don't wanna risk it. Open to other suggestions as well! These just looked like the best options and were close by.",1,1761196197.0,askdfw,0,1.0,False

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 35 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!


Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do.

*This has been eating at me for three years. I still can’t forgive myself.*

I was 20 when I met her.

Young. Naive. Thought I understood how the world worked.

I'd been through relationships before, drama, games, the kind that left me exhausted and convinced that maybe love wasn’t real.

Then she walked into my life.

And everything I thought I knew... shattered.

She was different. The kind of person who would cry if she even thought about doing something wrong.

I'd never met anyone like that before. I didn’t even know people like that existed.

It made me question everything.

Had I been the toxic one all along?

Or had I just never met someone truly good until her?

I fell. Fast. Harder than I thought possible.

Me the guy who said relationships were bullshit, who never let anyone in, completely folded within a week.

She proved me wrong about everything.

We clicked in ways I didn’t know were possible.

Movie nights that turned into watching the sunrise.

Late night car rides with music playing and her soft voice filling the silence.

She’d surprise me at work, and we’d escape together doing silly, meaningless things that somehow meant everything.

And I trusted her. Completely. Unconditionally.

That was rare for me. I don’t trust easily. I keep walls up.

But with her, the walls came down.

There were no games. Just peace.

I knew she would never hurt me.

If she even had a passing thought about betraying me, she would have cried from the guilt alone.

That’s the kind of loyalty I had with her. The kind most people spend their whole lives searching for.

Then I changed jobs.

Met new people. The kind who lived differently.

They introduced me to nightlife. Ibiza. Models. Escorts. A whole world I’d never seen before.

And I wanted it.

I was 22 and thought I was missing out. Thought there was this whole life I needed to experience before I could settle down.

I remember one night, coming home late.

She was sitting on the couch, waiting for me, watching one of our shows.

She looked up and smiled, that soft, genuine smile that made everything feel okay.

And I remember thinking, “I’ll come back to this. After I get it out of my system, I’ll come back.”

But I never did.

I ended it. Cleanly.

Told her I needed to figure myself out. That I wasn’t ready.

All the lines people use when they’re too cowardly to say the truth.

I spent the next two years chasing that life.

I slept with almost 40 women. Models. Randoms. Escorts.

Looking for something, connection, maybe. Validation. Proof that I’d made the right choice.

I found none of it.

And one day, sitting alone after another meaningless encounter, it hit me.

I felt empty. Completely, devastatingly empty.

I’d been with 40 women and felt nothing. No connection. No trust. No peace.

And I thought about her. About what I’d lost.

The only person I’d ever truly loved. The only one who made me feel safe.

I’d traded her for nothing.

For emptiness disguised as freedom.

I decided I would win her back.

But I couldn’t bring myself to reach out. Not immediately.

For months, I went to war with myself.

Should I message her? Or would I just hurt her again?

What if I made the same mistake twice?

Some nights I’d open my messages, type her name, stare at our old conversations for hours, then close the app.

I was terrified, of hurting her again, of not being enough.

But eventually, I decided she was worth the risk.

So I opened the app.

Found her name.

Clicked on her profile.

And saw it.

A photo. Two hands clasped together. Wedding rings gleaming.

She was married.

And in what felt like the universe’s cruelest joke, her husband had the same name as me.

The universe really said, “Here’s your replacement. Fuck you.”

I stared at that photo for I don’t know how long.

Then I closed the app.

And I haven’t opened it since.

That was three years ago.

Three years since I realized what I’d thrown away.

And I haven’t been able to move forward since.

I’ve tried. Met other people. Given them chances.

But every single time, I compare them to her, her gentleness, her loyalty, her trust.

And everyone falls short.

Is that fair? Maybe not.

But how do you accept anything less once you’ve known something that real?

People tell me I’m stuck in the past. That I need to move on.

But they don’t understand, I’m not romanticizing a memory.

She really was that way.

And now, everyone else feels like a compromise.

So I work. Eighteen hour days.

Building businesses. Coding until sunrise.

Some days I think I’m genuinely passionate.

Other days, I know I’m just running from the pain, from the reality that I had something perfect and destroyed it with my own hands.

All I know is this:

I had something real. Something rare.

And I let it go.

Not for something better. Not for growth.

For nothing.

They say you don’t know what you have until it’s gone.

They’re right.

But what they don’t tell you is sometimes, by the time you realize what you’ve lost, it’s already too late.

She’s married now.

Probably happy. Probably never thinks about me.

And I’m here, still working, still building, still carrying her memory like a weight I can’t put down.

Maybe this pain is trying to teach me something.

About love. About loss. About what actually matters.

I learned too late that some people come into your life to show you what love really is.

And once they do, your job isn’t to take it for granted.

Your job is to hold on.

It’s been three years.

I still think about her every day.

I still compare everyone to her.

And I still don’t have an answer.

It’s easier to move on when someone hurts you, when they cheat or lie.

Because then you can be angry.

But how do you move on from someone who never hurt you?

Someone who only loved you, trusted you, waited for you?

Someone you walked away from while they were still holding your hand?

There’s no anger to hide behind. No betrayal to blame.

Just the quiet, suffocating weight of knowing you did this to yourself.

I let go of someone I loved, not because I had to, but because I thought I wanted something else.

And that’s the kind of regret that doesn’t fade.

Sometimes I see strangers holding hands, at coffee shops, on street corners, in passing cars and my chest tightens.

Because somewhere out there, she’s probably doing the same thing.

I'm sorry if you spit out your coffee when you read that, but hear me out before you smash a novel out on your mechanical keyboard to fight me on this.

My approach to testing software boils down to one fundamental:
Building confidence in the changes we're delivering

So if you're preparing your debate points, just know that this is the perspective I'm grounded in.

How we build confidence can and will look different from situation to situation.

When I build parsers, I almost always go straight to TDD. I don't even love TDD, but I treat my system like a blackbox and test inputs and outputs. I am constantly rearranging the guts of my parsing logic and I just want to make sure I get the right stuff out based on what I put in.

When I build bigger or more complex systems, this story changes. Quite a bit. Just because there are different scenarios I need to consider.

""But you must test against the API, not the implementation details!""

When I'm writing code, there are some things that aren't known on the API but they're behaviors I expect. And if I need confidence on those things, you can bet your butt that I'm going to write tests to give me that confidence.

Some things that I can't just ""test against the API"" of the method I'm calling:
- Does my call to an external service handle exceptions properly?
- If necessary, does that call handle retries accordingly?
- Before we go roll out a deployment worldwide to hundreds of thousands of servers, are we sending the right telemetry?
- Do we have the right logging in place for helpful debug information?

... There are countless scenarios I've encountered where it's been helpful to test implementation details. 

""But then your tests become brittle! You can never change the code now!!!""

Look, you're changing the code without the coverage and breaking all sorts of expected behavior because it wasn't ""against the API"" so there were no tests.

Now if you made it this far before you rushed to the comments to rage:
- No, I don't think this is the only way to test
- Yes, I would (generally) prefer system/integration tests since they've become very cheap/fast to run
- No, I don't think any one type of test is superior to all of them
- Yes, I do mix all sorts of testing into my codebase
- Yes, I refactor code non-stop
- Yes, there are absolutely times I have to blow away tests when I rewrite the guts of something

But along the way I'm deciding where I need to build confidence with all of the tools at my disposal.

I was talking to my friend the other day—he's a civil engineer, the kind of guy who builds bridges and trusts math more than metaphysics. He'd read my first God Circuit piece and cornered me at a coffee shop with that look engineers get when reality starts acting suspicious.

""Okay,"" he said, stirring his coffee like he was mixing concrete, ""give me the translation. What's this Monroe Wave thing actually doing to people's brains? And don't give me the mystical version. Give me the version that won't make my calculator cry.""

So here's the translation. The engineer's guide to consciousness hacking. The scientific breakdown of why some frequencies literally teach your brain to believe itself into new realities.

# What the Monroe Wave Is — Minus the Jargon

The Monroe Wave is a pattern of hemispheric synchronization.

Think of it like this: your brain has two singers—left hemisphere and right hemisphere—who've been trying to harmonize for your entire life but keep hitting different notes. The left brain wants to analyze everything into neat little boxes. The right brain wants to feel everything into vast, swirling patterns.

Most of the time, they're slightly off-key from each other. Not terrible, but not... unified.

The Monroe Wave is the frequency that gets both singers to finally hit the same harmony.

When both sides of the brain hum in unison, consciousness stretches like warm glass.

Monroe figured out that if you feed slightly different frequencies to each ear—say 100 Hz to the left, 104 Hz to the right—the brain does something fascinating. It creates a third frequency, a phantom beat at 4 Hz, trying to reconcile the difference. That 4 Hz pulse becomes the conductor, getting both hemispheres to sync up and dance together.

It's like tuning a guitar. Except the guitar is your consciousness, and when it's finally in tune, you can play songs that were impossible before.

# Neuroplasticity: The Body's Built-In Spellwork

Here's where it gets interesting for people like Sammy who need their magic to have mechanisms.

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to rewire itself based on repeated patterns of thought and emotion. Every time you think a thought, you're literally carving a groove in your neural network. Think the same thought with enough emotional charge, enough repetition, and that groove becomes a highway.

This is the mechanical proof of manifestation. We literally sculpt the receiver before the signal arrives.

When you're in a Monroe Wave state, your brain is in optimal rewiring mode. The hemispheric synchronization creates what neuroscientists call a ""hypnagogic state""—that drowsy, dreamlike consciousness where the usual filters drop away and the brain becomes more plastic, more moldable.

It's like heating metal before you forge it. The Monroe frequency heats up your consciousness, making it soft enough to reshape.

So when people talk about ""manifesting"" in these states, they're not just thinking positive thoughts into the void. They're literally reorganizing their neural architecture. They're building new highways in their brain that lead to different destinations.

Your thoughts aren't just wishes. They're construction equipment.

# The Crossover Point — Where Science Meets Spell

Here's what I find delicious about this whole thing: Monroe measured it, but witches have been using it for centuries.

The frequency range Monroe discovered—4 to 8 Hz—is the same range shamans, mystics, and hedge witches have been accessing through drumming, chanting, breathwork, and ritual for millennia. They just didn't have the technology to measure the brain waves.

You call it casting, they call it conditioning. Same process, different vocabulary.

Both traditions understand that repetition plus emotional charge equals reality alteration. Whether you're chanting over a candle or listening to binaural beats through headphones, you're doing the same thing: changing matter through repetition and emotional charge.

The witch knows her spell works because she can feel the shift in consciousness. The neuroscientist knows it works because they can measure the shift in brain waves. Same shift, different instruments.

Monroe just gave us the training wheels. Instead of spending years learning to drum yourself into trance, you can put on headphones and get there in twenty minutes.

It's the democratization of consciousness states. Magic for people who need their mysticism to come with user manuals.

# The Takeaway

Don't chase the exotic; train the brain.

I see people spending thousands of dollars on crystals, courses, and consciousness retreats, looking for some external technology to shift their reality. Meanwhile, the most sophisticated reality-creation device ever designed is sitting between their ears, and most people never learn how to operate it properly.

Your magic isn't in the candle; it's in the circuit.

The Monroe Wave is just one tool for accessing neuroplastic states. But once you understand the principle—that consciousness can be tuned like an instrument, and that tuned consciousness can literally rewire reality—you realize you don't need special equipment.

You need special understanding.

You need to grasp that your brain is not fixed. Your patterns are not permanent. Your reality is not set in stone.

Every thought you think with emotional intensity is vote for the world you want to live in. The Monroe Wave just makes those votes count double.

# Why This Matters Now

We're living in a time when the old systems—religion, government, education—are teaching us to outsource our power. To wait for salvation, permission, or instruction from external authorities.

But consciousness research is proving what mystics have always known: you are the authority. Your brain is the temple. Your thoughts are the prayers that reshape matter.

Understanding the Monroe Wave isn't about becoming a better manifester. It's about becoming a more conscious creator. It's about realizing that reality isn't something that happens to you—it's something that broadcasts from you.

When you know that your brain waves can be tuned, that your neural networks can be rewired, that your consciousness can be trained like a muscle, you stop being a victim of circumstance and start being an artist of experience.

That's not magic. That's just applied neuroscience.

But honestly? The distinction is starting to matter less and less.

# A Final Note for All the Other Engineers

You don't have to believe in magic to use these tools. You just have to believe in neuroplasticity. You just have to accept that your brain is more flexible than you were taught, and that consciousness is more trainable than anyone told you.

The Monroe Wave works whether you think it's science or sorcery. Neuroplasticity operates whether you call it brain training or spell casting.

Call it neuroplasticity or witchcraft—either way, your thoughts are rewiring the cosmos.

The only question is: what reality are you going to wire yourself for?",1,1761195438.0,u_Sparkling_Lady80,0,1.0,False

# Best Season for Poon Hill Trek

 

The trek to the wonderful village in Annapurna Ghorepani Poonhill can be done anytime throughout the year. However, as everything has its pros and cons likewise, there are several benefits as well as disadvantages in each season and you have to balance the trek yourself.

 

# Spring- March to May

 

The months from March to May are one of the most remarkable seasons for the trek. As this trek is at a relatively low altitude, the days are warmer from March to May, making it suitable for the trek.

Also, the days are sunny and clear making the views panoramic and wonderful. The vegetation is at its best with full bloom in spring. Highlighting the national flower of Nepal, Rhododendron at radiant color, this trek is best and suitable for all nature lovers.

On the other hand, the temperatures range between 10 to 24 degrees celsius, with the temperature on Poon Hill itself dropping to freezing point.

That’s when they lighten the mood by serving tea and coffee during the sunrise. Similarly, there is no rain during this time and the skies will be clear represent the best of Poonhill.

 

# Monsoon – June to August

 

Monsoon is always wonderful and most people out there enjoy traveling to Monsoon. There is something wonderful that we love about monsoon.

The vegetation looks clean and fresh with the stunning view of snow-capped mountains. Sometimes the mountains will disappear behind rain clouds, but that just makes it all the more special.

Temperatures are not so different from those of the springtime, perhaps a bit less cold at the higher points of this trek. The temperatures range from around 9 to 24 degrees celsius.

You might be lucky and have no rain at all but most common people can expect rain for short periods every day. Because of the rainfall, the trails will be more slippery.

If you want to trek in peace without much of a crowd then monsoon is the ideal season for you.  
Drinking hot tea inside your teahouse watching the rain falling outside can be just as magical an experience.

 

# Autumn-September to November

 

Autumn is one of the best seasons for the Poon Hill trek. Generally, autumn starts from September to October and is a season that attracts a lot of trekkers to Poon hill.

This season is trendy among trekkers as this season receives little or no rainfall making the trekking trail easier and more convenient.

Besides, the clear weather during this season offers a panoramic view of the majestic Himalayas, as well as the natural landscapes. Besides, the clear blue Sky and the bearable temperature make this season the best among the trekkers.

Perhaps being the best time to trek the Himalayas, the trails to Poon hill will be busier.

Autumn is the main festival season in Nepal. Apart from the natural view, you can witness the culture and festivals in Nepal during Autumn.

The temperatures in Autumn are similar to spring, getting cooler as the season gets later. But expect in the region of 10 to 24 degrees celsius, with the temperature on Poon Hill itself dropping to freezing point.

 

# Winter- December to February

 

Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek is a low-altitude trek compared to other Himalayas treks. This trek can also be carried out during the winter.

The month from December to February is the winter months in Nepal where the temperature drops at the freezing point at a higher altitude. But temperatures at Ghorepani are bearable with warm clothing and extra preparations.

The temperatures drop to freezing in the mornings and evenings where the day temperatures will still be around 15 degrees Celsius which is very comfortable for hiking.

Overall the chances of rainfall during this month are probably low. however, there may be some light snow.

Again if you want to explore nature peacefully without a crowd then yes winter is ideal for you. As there will be fewer trekkers on the trail. Also, there will be no problem getting accommodation at teahouses.

Similarly, Mountain views will be stunning in the frosty air.

 

# Accommodation in Poon Hill Trek

 

The trek to Poonhill is one of the most satisfying treks in Nepal both naturally and culturally. Throughout the journey to Poon hill, accommodation varies from luxurious to basic with lots of differences in between.

As the trek will start and end in Pokhara, the type of accommodation depends on your style and budget Pokhara as well. The higher you go up in the remote area, the more simple the accommodation will be.

Fortunately, there are nice rooms available in the majority of tea houses here in the Ghorepani trek. Most rooms have twin beds. However, only a few have attached bathrooms.

On average a twin room in a teahouse on the Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek will cost you $3-6 per night.  
On the other hand, you are expected to eat in the tea houses where you will be staying.

They’ll generally ask you to order your food as you check-in. Furthermore, the tea houses here are charming, made from stone and wood, and a cozy place to relax at the end of a long day’s trekking.

 

# Foods in Poon Hill Trek

 

The meals after a day of hiking taste even better. Many trekking trails in Nepal offer typical Nepali food including the Poon Hill trek.

Similarly, you can find familiar food such as pasta, fried potatoes, and pancakes, and perhaps the less familiar such as Dal Bhat. Dal Bhat is the staple food of Nepal and you will come to love it.

Dal, Lentil soup, rice, and a variety of vegetables made into a curry will give you stamina for the next day’s trek.

A healthy and filling meal at the end of the day will boost your energy after a long walk. Likewise, Drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic are available, as are tea and coffee.

Moreover, you also find snacks such as energy bars, nuts, chocolate, etc along the trail. However, these will be quite expensive here in Poon hill.

Therefore, you can bring some along with you from Pokhara, the starting and ending city for your tour.

# Useful Tips for Poon Hill Trek

 

Trek to Poon hill is a relatively easy trek and almost people of every age group can do this trek. However, certain things need to be considered while trekking in any place. Likewise, here are some of the useful treks for trekking to Poon Hill Trek.

 

# Start Early

 

It is always the best idea to start the trek early in any place including Poon hill. Trekking early lets you witness a stunning view of the entire landscape and mountains in the morning.

You will have more time to spend with nature if you start early. Nothing can beat the sunrise view at the peak of the majestic Himalayas that starts early.

 

# Carry extra Handcash

 

It is always wise to carry extra hand cash when it is for a trek. If you want to buy something you have to pay by hand cash as credit cards are not accepted in the upper part of this region.

So if you want to buy anything you need a certain amount of hand cash.

 

# Carry comfortable backpack

 

A comfortable backpack can make your trip memorable and comfortable.

Although Ghorepani Poon hill is not an extreme trek like another altitude trek, you can easily trek here without any difficulties but it is always a better idea to be prepared.

Carrying a comfortable backpack will make your trek much more easier and comfortable.",1,1761195294.0,uniquepath12342435,0,1.0,False

*June 6th, 1944*  
**Bravery isn’t the absence of fear—it’s advancing while scared shitless.**

Steve counted the days until he turned eighteen. He wanted to follow his father’s path: to enlist, to fight in Europe, to continue the family line of honor born in the Civil War.  
His great-grandfather had fallen at Gettysburg in 1863, leading the First Regiment of Minnesota—almost wiped out after charging the Confederate line.  
His father, a veteran of the Great War, had fought in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. He returned with an eye patch and medals that smelled of metal, blood, and honor. Ironically, after surviving the hell of the trenches, he died a few years later, in 1927, of a ridiculous fever.

Then came the great day: September 19th, 1943. Steve enlisted as a volunteer on his eighteenth birthday.  
That morning, his mother spoiled him with a grand breakfast—fried eggs, bacon, pancakes with honey, jam, and freshly brewed coffee. She walked him to the door and hugged him tightly, eyes glistening.  
“Come back in one piece, Stevie… we’re proud of you.”  
He was already turning toward the military bus when she called out, voice trembling:  
“Stevie, wait!”  
She pulled a small silver chain from her pocket, engraved with his father’s name and blood type—identical to his own. She placed it in his hand and closed his fingers around it.  
“So he can protect you from above.”

Before boarding, Steve looked back one last time. His mother stood there, eyes full of tears, his little sister of four clinging to her hand.  
Above the roof, the Stars and Stripes hung solemnly, barely stirred by the morning breeze. It was a family ritual started by his father and never once interrupted—except to be washed.

He climbed aboard. The training was brutal: crawling through mud, sliding under barbed wire, scaling walls, hauling wounded comrades across endless obstacle courses.  
In the barracks he shared space with dozens of boys—some volunteers, others drafted. A few were nervous, others smoked in bed flipping through magazines of naked women, and some wrote letters to their girlfriends. Steve just lay on his side, staring at the wall, drowning in thought.

On January 14th, 1944, they boarded the *SS George Washington*, escorted by battleships and destroyers. The crossing lasted fourteen days. Bad weather churned the Atlantic; the cabins reeked of vomit and sweat. Showers were a privilege for officers; the rest slept in life vests, fearing the invisible torpedo of a German U-boat.

To breathe something that wasn’t human stench, Steve went out on deck. He couldn’t stop staring at the mass of transport ships surrounded by warships and escorts.  
Each hull bore scars of bullets, bombs, explosions, and torpedoes, flying the American flags—dirty, patched, and torn—**as if heading straight into a hero’s graveyard.**

It was then he realized he wasn’t going to a card game, a football match, or a boxing fight.  
He was going to a goddamn war.

He pulled a crumpled pack from his pocket, lit a cigarette, and inhaled slowly—wanting, for a brief moment, air that didn’t smell like smoked humanity.  
As he exhaled, a thought hit him: *If I die, all my mother will receive is a medal and a letter of condolence. A polite way to say: “Your son’s corpse is rotting somewhere in Europe… or worse, it exploded into nothing.”*

A sudden roar filled the sky. He looked up: squadrons of fighters and bombers cutting through the clouds toward the same direction—England. He knew the Allied force was planning something big… and bloody.

By late January they reached Portsmouth. For the first time he saw the British flag waving over the docks. From there, a military train carried them to Wiltshire—a landscape of low hills and flooded fields.  
Even without rain, the sky was gray, relentlessly gray, as if the sun itself had been drafted.

After months of night parachute training, Steve and his comrades knew something colossal was coming, though no one said where or when. The secret was locked inside the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The concentration of planes, tanks, and soldiers left no doubt: what was coming would be enormous.

In his bunk, Steve unfolded his mother’s last letter for the hundredth time:

>

He kissed the letter, folded it, slipped it into his combat jacket, and fell asleep. Neither he nor his brothers in arms had any idea what awaited them the next day—a moment when history itself would stop and hold its breath.

June 5th, 1944.  
The paratroopers of the 101st *Screaming Eagles* were tense. Bad weather had postponed the mission the day before. They spent the day checking their fifty-kilo gear: rifle, ammo, grenades, explosives, rations, canteen.

At ten p.m. came the order: *Board the planes.*  
The great moment had arrived. Many swallowed hard; Eisenhower’s last words echoed in their heads: *“We go.”*  
No turning back.

Steve took his place inside the aircraft. Adrenaline shook him; his hands trembled.  
Between eleven and midnight, the C-47s took off toward Normandy. Fear and excitement wrestled inside him. Around him, men crossed themselves or whispered prayers—some clutching crosses, others Stars of David, others photos of wives and children—as if God and destiny had taken sides.  
Steve only begged to come back alive for his mother; imagining her grief hurt more than dying itself.

The engines roared—two fourteen-cylinder Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasps, 2,400 horses of thunder—making every rivet in the plane vibrate.  
The noise was deafening; some men wet their pants from sheer terror. The stench was unbearable: piss, metal, and somewhere, the sour scent of fear turned to shit.  
Steve looked out the window and froze.

The English Channel was on fire.  
It wasn’t a city; it was the greatest fleet ever assembled by mankind, bound for the greatest landing in history.  
Seven thousand ships of war.  
Everything would happen at dawn, June 6th.

He looked up: not one, not ten, not a hundred—**thousands** of black silhouettes in formation, like birds migrating.  
Only this time, they were war eagles carrying twenty-three thousand souls.  
The full force of Allied might, the largest military machine ever built.

Steve didn’t know if what churned in his gut was fear, adrenaline, or pride.  
He understood he was about to step into one of the most decisive moments in human history.  
The Anglo-American alliance had pushed all its chips onto the table.  
There was no turning back.

He and his comrades would jump behind enemy lines to disable the charges wired to blow the bridges. One mistake, and everything would collapse.  
He wasn’t watching history.  
He *was* history.

And maybe the only thing left of him would be a couple of medals and a presidential condolence.

Steve pressed the letter to his chest and tucked it into the warmest place he had—his heart pocket.

For nearly a year, Steve and those men fought alongside two million others who gradually landed on the beaches. They bled, they fought, they triumphed.

Few remember their names, but their deaths were sanctified by victory.  
They built a marble temple to freedom, worn like a golden medal on the chest of civilization.

With their blood, they paid the price of peace.  
With their guts, the price of prosperity.  
With their lives, the price of glory.

History ended up calling them **the Greatest Generation.**",1,1761194913.0,HistoricalFiction,0,1.0,False

# But for now we see through a glass darkly

  
Ghost in the Shell (Kôkaku Kidôtai) (1995): 9 out of 10: An anime Cyberpunk adventure set in the far future of 2029, Ghost in the Shell is both a fantastic anime and a fantastic movie.

The Good: The ghost in Ghost in the Shell refers to the ability to cast one’s consciousness into a mechanical body and control it from afar. The influence Ghost in the Shell had on future sci-fi such as [The Matrix is more than clear (Right down to the plug-ins that the characters have on the back of their necks and the Matrix Raining Code in the opening credits.)](https://cinematicdiversions.com/the-matrix-1999-review/)

The ascetic is very near future grounded in 1995’s reality in many ways with fantastical elements. The overall feel of the movie is as a result, it is both a noir-style mystery and a fantastically speculative science fiction.

  
The animation is simply top-notch, combining mostly tradition animation with rudimentary CGI. It is gorgeous. The detail work on the backgrounds in the city is a particular standout. The cyborgs are actually quite western, with our lead Major, a busty dark-haired warrior who looks a little like Lucy Lawless or Scarlett Johansson. The action scenes are often quite well done.

For a mid-nineties anime, the story is fairly easy to follow. This is not [Akira](https://cinematicdiversions.com/akira-review/). The characters mostly come into their own through the plot and storytelling rather than expositional information dumps Sci-Fi is often guilty of.

  
The Bad: Now, while the story may be easy to follow eventually and the themes about humanity have been explored many times in different ways. There is a bit of a learning curve. Think Blade Runner, the AP course. Unlike Blade Runner, however, there isn’t that much emotional attachment to the characters. They are often cyphers rather than living, breathing personalities. This is fair since they are cyborgs, of course, but Blade Runner’s genius was to make its cyborgs more human than the humans. Ghost in the Shell misses this trick.

There is also an argument to be made that Ghost in the Shell has its own head up its ass for much of the film. Bear with me. The original anime was much more humorous, sexy, and The Major was a party girl eventually scarred with her interaction with the big bad, the puppet master.

  
In the film version, The Major starts of as stoic as Gary Cooper in High Noon and never really breaks character till the very end. There are few character arcs in Ghost in the Shell. As a result, it is much harder to get emotionally attached to Major.

The Ugly: I could put [the CGI upgrade Ghost in the Shell 2.0](https://cinematicdiversions.com/ghost-in-the-shell-2-0-2008-review/) but it really isn’t that bad. Just unnecessary.

One of the most important anime releases (along with [Ninja Scroll](https://cinematicdiversions.com/ninja-scroll-review/), [Akira](https://cinematicdiversions.com/akira-review/) and Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend) Ghost in the Shell was a much bigger hit outside of Japan than in. The manga that the anime is based on is a different beast (it starts with a lesbian threesome) and as a result, local audiences were not impressed with the now stoic main characters and philosophic navel gazing.

In Conclusion: Ghost in the Shell is a very pretty and very good film with a lot of really makes you think themes. It is surprisingly fun, though one gets the sense that it was really not trying to be fun. It easily could have been a disaster. We have all seen anime films so concerned with their 8th grade level philosophical underpinnings they forget they are making a piece of entertainment.

I wouldn’t recommend Ghost in the Shell as baby’s first anime. But if you are in the right mood (coffee, not beer) it is one hell of a watch.",1,1761194520.0,CinematicDiversions,0,1.0,False

And then I don’t understand how people can sip and enjoy their drinks like it’s a coke or coffee or something. I had this one canned drink given to me once that I can’t remember the name of but it was the most tolerable one I’ve tried and even then it wasn’t exactly an enjoyable experience lol I just sort of forced myself to swallow. The most recent time I drank I only got half the shot in my mouth before spitting it back up into the sink and then I ran away from the party and threw up in my room lmao 

Am I just particularly sensitive to alcohol? Is that a real sensitivity that people can have? I know that I also have a very negative reaction to the smell of alcohol. Being around people drinking makes me nauseous because I can smell it in the air. Literally even thinking about it makes me queasy it’s like imagining the sound of nails on a chalkboard. I have a similar problem with being in hospitals because the smell of alcohol in the air makes my nose burn. Also I’m neurodivergent so I’ve heard in passing that my autism or the medication I take could be related to my issue but idk for sure. I know many other people with the same variables as me and they drink happily so

I probably only drink a couple times a year and it’s not bc I want to lol. It’s always on my close friends’ birthdays because I know they want me to drink like everybody else is and refusing makes me feel like I’m being rude. They don’t actually force me to they know I have problems lol but I still feel that way bc I’m socially awkward 

Am I just being dramatic? Or am I just doing it wrong or something? I know that drinking is inherently bad for you and its not at all important like I understand that but still I want to be able to enjoy drinking with my friends and I want to enjoy the feeling of being drunk. Like I have major fomo about it. But everything just makes me so so sick. And it’s extremely embarrassing to have that kind of reaction in front of others. Is there a certain kind of drink that might work better for me? Or maybe a mixer or something that can at least make it somewhat enjoyable?

Any advice is really appreciated. Thanks!",2,1761194341.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,1.0,False

I looked around, but no one was there. I didn’t know who had left it. I just sat there, overwhelmed, and quietly let the tears fall. Something so simple, just a few words from a stranger, reminded me that someone out there cared even without knowing me.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **FCSB vs. Bologna: A Tale of Two Europas (One Nervous, One Confident)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Europa League clash that’s like a mismatched tennis doubles team: FCSB, the Romanian underdogs with the emotional stability of a cat in a room full of vacuum cleaners, host Bologna, the Italian side playing like they’ve just remembered where they put their confidence. Let’s break this down with the statistical precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a stand-up economist.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Bologna’s Price Tag Feels Like a “Buy One, Get One Free” Deal

The odds tell a story where Bologna is the star of the show. At **1.55 to 1.62** (depending on the bookie), Bologna’s implied probability of winning sits around **61-64%**. FCSB? They’re the sports equivalent of a last-minute Netflix addition: **5.5 to 6.0** odds (**15-17%**) suggest they’re here for the ambiance, not the trophy. The draw? A middle-ground gamble at **3.8 to 4.1** (**24-26%**), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “If you want drama, here’s your ticket.”

But here’s the kicker: FCSB’s historical record against Italian teams is worse than a tourist’s Google Translate mishap. They’ve won just **1 of 15 major European matches** against Italian sides since 2018, scoring a grand total of **five goals**. Meanwhile, Bologna’s last seven European away games? **Zero wins**, but also only **two losses**—because sometimes, in football, “failure” is just “not Bologna.”

---

### Digesting the News: Why FCSB’s Long Passes Are Like a Bad Tinder Bio

FCSB’s strategy this season? They’ve launched more long passes than a Game of Thrones binge-watcher on a coffee high (**130+ long passes**, 20% of their total—highest in the Europa League). But here’s the rub: When they win, they \*\*average just 26

1odu0x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1odu0x4/hm_a_dark_comedic_original_short_story_about_a/,"[HM] A Dark, Comedic original short story about a hitman that cannot die, but keeps on blundering. He's Russo, Vince Russo. There's one question that remains unanswered, ""He Fell for the Girl Whose Dad he Accidentally Killed, What now?","Hey everyone!  
I wrote this dark-comedy short story about a hitman who can’t die and somehow keeps blundering every kill in the most absurd ways. Would love to hear what you think! feedback, reviews, critiques are all welcome!

# My First Day As A Hitman.

They told me that every killer remembers his first kill. Mine began with a banana peel and ended with a bullet in my own spleen.

The city was sweating rain that day, not that romantic kind that makes women behind misty windows look mysteriously attractive, but the cheap type which ruins your shoes if you step into the wrong puddle. The rain was hammering down, and here I was in my ‘anticipated’ water proof suit, walking without an umbrella in the dark, among normal people with umbrellas. I liked it, it made me feel dangerous. What I did not know, was that I felt dangerous even when I was crossing a busy street without using the crosswalk.

Name’s Vincent Russo, but you can call me just Vince, and yeah, it was my first day on the job. I was told that it was easy, the target was an accountant, who was allegedly going to reveal Cartel transactions to the Bastion City Police.   
“He’ll be on fifth street, goes by the name Carlos”, said the boss, “Just don’t make a scene”. I nodded my head like I had been doing this since I was six.

The time had come, I climbed up the rooftop, directly opposite to Carlos’ office on the adjacent street. He was right there, sitting on his table, doing stuff on his typewriter, typing away like it was a piano. He seemed like a nice guy. Wait wait wait…I gotta kill him. I reset my thoughts back to factory settings by clinging my fist and shaking my arms violently all whilst taking a deep breath. I summoned some almonds from my pocket and popped them into my mouth my lucky ‘focus nuts’ which, for reasons unknown to science, always made me sleepy at exactly the wrong time. The ledge I was sitting on was high, and I dozed off. I woke up to find myself thirty floors down from where I was supposed to be. My neck was at an angle feared by geometry students, but don’t worry guys, it did not hurt, it never did. I just….just can’t die.

Now please don’t ask me why, it is a long story, including a shady fortune teller at Chinatown, and some bad decisions.

I got up, brushed the gravel off my suit and tried again.  
Same plan, different angle. This time, I decided to sneak in through the back alley and silence the accountant, for good. I buttoned my suit up and whispered “Action!”, putting up a serious face, pumping my heart with purpose, and walking like a Chinese  copy of James Bond. All that confidence blew out really fast, rather you can call it being ‘extinguished’. I slipped. Yeah, you might have guessed it right, on a @#!?  Banana peel! I accidentally pressed the trigger, by precisely calibrated misfortune, the bullet went through my spleen. The gun shot did something far worse, it created what my boss called, “A Scene”. 

The accountant rushed out of his office, checking for potential danger as he had been receiving threats lately. He looked towards the right as he was crossing the street. And then it happened. A garbage truck ran over him. I do not know if people like him are dumb or what, but man? Were you not taught in second grade that look on both sides of the street before crossing? Come on! My kill got stolen, by…by a GARBAGE truck. Picture the newspaper headline the next day, “Auditor Audited by Trash Truck”, nothing but pure humiliation…even after death.

On the other hand, I was lying down, hugging close to my beloved planet earth, wondering, “Pain’s temporary. Embarrassment is forever. Lucky for me, I’ve got a lifetime supply of both.”. After all, Mission Accomplished.

I got up and went to the place no one likes to go to, the hospital. Limping, with my hand pressed against the bullet hole, I marched to the emergency room, demanding immediate attention. I was laid down on a gurney and rushed to the operation theatre. What did you think? I won’t die, but surely I couldn’t leave a bullet inside me! What would happen if I happen to go through a CT scan in the near future?

I woke up in a private, premium hospital room, the type which I doubted my insurance company could afford. Wait… do I even have insurance?  
I was looking at the heart rate monitor as if it owed me money, each beep becoming more intimidating, that’s when the door swung open and a doctor walked in. Is it just me or do all doctors smell like antiseptic? He walked towards me and told me that I had “severe internal trauma” and “ had mysteriously survived despite flatlining many times”. Now, you know me very well, I suppose. What I cared about was not ‘thanking’ the doctor or worrying about the hospital bill, instead, I asked him.

“Doc, how many times did I exactly flatline?” He chuckled and replied, “Just enough times to make the defibrillator give up.”

The doctor went, and I got back to popping bubbles in my IV line. A nurse walked in with a metal trolley, filled with metallic hospital food. She put it on the table, and smiled at me. She then proceeded to produce something even more metallic… a silver colored brick phone, probably older than me. Without a word, she left.  
The phone rang in such a way that caused me to snap right back into reality. Still high on anesthesia, I picked it up, upside down. 

A grave voice spoke from the other side of the line, “Good job La malchance, clean kill.” I recognized him, it was Toto Wolffe, my boss. 

“Go get the files from his office before the police do.” Just as he was going to hang up, I asked him in the same manner a kid asks his dad, “Mr. Wolffe, what is La malchance?”

He snickered and replied, “It means The Misfortune in French, good luck.”

I ripped out my IV, put on my suit and left….without paying the bill, of course!  
You might think I am a morally wrong person, but don’t worry, I left a ‘Thank You’ sticky note for the doctor on the flatlined monitor in my room.

I sneaked into the office, this time doing everything perfectly. Maybe. With the flair of a sneaky cat, I frantically started searching for files. What I had not been told, was WHICH file. There were files here and there, and everywhere. Shifting my big brain into fifth gear, I decided to take all files and burn them. After an extremely tiring and long duration of stuffing files into my bag, I paused. A light shone from the adjacent room. It was a torch. I peeped round the corner to get a better look. I could not believe what I saw. A lady was walking towards the room I was in. The beam from the torch froze me. She was now right in front of me, just as confused as I was.

“Who are you? What are you doing in my dad’s office?” She asked.  
I straightened my tie, I don’t know what for, clearing my voice, “I am here to get some information” I said. 

“Information, what information?” She said, lowering her insanely bright torch.  
“I uh-I have been sent to recover some files, your father was in trouble with some dangerous people.”

Her eyes balanced between suspicion and trust.  
“He was a nice man” I added. 

“You knew him?” She questioned.

“Not well though, if I had, he might have been alive right now.”  
For the first time I saw her guard drop, relief crept over her face. 

“I am here to get some of his belongings” she said.  
“Let me help you, umm…” I stuttered.

“I am Clara, and you?”

Puffing my chest up like popcorn with pride and buttoning my suit, I said, “I am Russo, Vincent Russo, but you can call me Vince”. You see what I did there guys? When I was a kid,I used to rehearse, “Bond, James Bond” hoping that I would get to say my name like that, at least once in my life. I did.

She smiled, It was probably a laugh, I think. And just like that, I started liking her. Big mistake, Russo. BIG mistake.  
Picking up an old photo frame, “He used to bring me here after school,” she said softly. I nodded, pretending to be busy with some papers. It was at that moment I realized, that I just did not accidentally kill a target, I killed someone’s dad. Her dad.  
She talked, a lot. Let me define ‘a lot’ over here, it made me wonder if silence could file a restraining order.

She told me everything, all the way from her childhood, to quirky moments with her dad. Oh man, I wish I had parents…  
Alas! It was time to go, I picked up my bloated bag full of files. Just as I was about to leave, she asked me, “Can we go for a coffee tomorrow? I want someone to talk to.”  
Coffee?! With the daughter of the nice guy I killed. Brilliant idea, Vince. What could

possibly go wrong? I awkwardly smiled, without even giving it a thought, I agreed.

I took the bags and solemnly walked away. But, before I could burn them, I went to my friend Harold’s place. He was the commander of an army of copy machines. I trusted him. Me and Harold stayed up all night, making a copy of each file. See, I’m smart, ain’t I? He never asked me questions (because he had seen enough of my nonsense), instead he just did the job.  
I took the bags to the local incinerator, and well, incinerated them! I told Harold to keep the copies safe, who knows I might need them one day?

I called Toto to tell him that job’s done. By crushing my hopes for a much needed and well earned break, he handed me a new assignment. I wondered, did he forget that I was just shot like twelve hours ago? Ummm, shot by…leave it, its not worth asking for leave to your boss for shooting yourself I guess.  
“One quick job. In and out. Guy’s name is Marco, runs his mouth too much. Make it clean.” Said Toto. I reluctantly agreed. Surely I can squeeze a kill before my coffee date, right?

Marco lived on the fourth floor, easy climb. I used the water pipe to slither my way up like a slimy slug. Launching myself into the balcony, barely managing to land on my feet. I brushed some dust off my suit, and turned around. I could not believe all my senses, let alone my eyes. An old lady was standing there, horrified. A menacing black cat (the one that is considered bad luck) was scorning at me with disgraceful looks. Before I could react to the situation, the cat leaped towards me, I dodged it. The cat went flying out the balcony, falling down into the day, as its screech began to dampen. At that very instant there was one thing common between the old lady who was seemed too be alive on extra life coupons and us, we could do nothing just watch.

That is when I realized, this was the wrong balcony. I quickly ran into her apartment, almost tripping over pink knitting yarn. I opened her main door and walked out. Nonchalant, right? With the pink yarn still wrapped around my shoe, I removed my lock pick, just to find out it was a smart lock. I tried a random combination of numbers, and guess what? I’m not that misfortunate as you think. It worked. I sneaked into the living room. Jazz was playing over the radio, it was at that time when my short term fortune walked out the room, the same way it came in. I slipped on something that had sworn to humiliate me, my unsung enemy. On a… oh come on, not again! A Banana peel!

Marco shouted from the shower, “Who’s there?”. I replied, “Come hither to find out!”  
I saw a huge, well built figure appeared, with a revolver in his hand. I took a good look at him and so did he. We both looked down at the guns we held, and then looked up, looked down again and up. After repeating this a few more times, he fired a shot at me. Now, what exactly happens when you have bad aim? I’ll tell you children.

The bullet ricocheted off the frying pan beside me and then the massive painting. Both of us tracked the bullet with our eyes, trying to figure out where it would go next. It locked on its target and struck Marco right in the chest. I had to do nothing. It was his bullet that killed him, no forced entry, basically I was never here. Wait…The old lady? Never mind, she would run out of her coupons soon.  
I looked at my watch, I had ten minutes to reach the cafe where me and Clara had decided to meet. See, I am such an efficient hitman!

I found a bicycle leaning against the wall. No lock, no owner, waiting to be adopted. I jumped onto it, and pedaled my way to the cafe. I fell through the cafe door like a drunk man, huffing and puffing. I took a quick look and found Clara sitting on a table, waiting. I asked the waiter if. He had some perfume, he quickly smuggled some to me, I owed him a tip, a big one. I sat down in front of Clara. She smiled, and greeted me.  
Surprisingly, I told her that I was all ears, and am ready to listen to whatever she has to say.  
She nodded and thanked me, gradually letting out all the emotions she had bottled up. She was comfortable around me, although I was an emotionless partly immortal human being.

That is when Toto walked in, with his platoon of bodyguards. With one snap of his fingers, the cafe went empty. It was now just me, Clara, Toto and his army. He creeped unto my shoulder and said, “Ah, Russo. Didn’t think I’d find you on a date after cleaning up the accountant mess.”  
Clara froze, went as cold as ice.  
“Accountant…? You mean my dad?” She spoke, hands shaking.  
Silence. Deafening Silence.  
Vince doesn’t speak. Toto smirks.

“Oh… you didn’t tell her?”  
“Vince?….Vince?”

I wished I could die, die at that very moment.

Listen, that notification popping up? It's an invitation, not a subpoena. As a 1099 independent contractor, you're not DoorDash's employee—they can't force you to take a job any more than your buddy can make you grab their coffee run. Legally, under U.S. labor laws (think the Fair Labor Standards Act and independent contractor classifications), you have zero obligation to accept work. Declining isn't ""insubordination""; it's your business choice. DoorDash's own Dasher agreement spells it out: your acceptance rate doesn't factor into pay, priority, or deactivation. They can't ding you for it without breaching that contract, and courts have backed drivers on this—treating you like an at-will servant would flip your status to employee, opening them up to overtime, benefits lawsuits, and a world of hurt.

Can it ""lead"" to deactivation? Nah, not legally for declining alone. Deacts happen for stuff like chronic lateness (one violation isn't enough, per their policy), fraud, or safety issues—not picky order shopping. Sure, some Dashers whisper about ""shadowbans"" or priority drops after mass declines, but that's anecdotal smoke, not fire. DoorDash publicly denies it affects you, and in places like Seattle, new laws even mandate 14-day notices for deacts (except egregious stuff) to stop knee-jerk boots. If they try? Appeal it, cite your contract, and lawyer up if needed—plenty of wrongful deact suits have DoorDash coughing up settlements.

**Bottom line: Decline that $2.50 airport run to Timbuktu. Your acceptance rate can hover at 0% guilt-free. It's your dash, your call.**

# The Logistics Breakdown: Brokers, Shippers, and Carriers in Trad World

To get why DoorDash feels like a twisted version of this, let's unpack traditional logistics. It's a trillion-dollar machine moving freight (pallets, containers) cross-country, not just burritos. Three core players keep it rolling:

https://preview.redd.it/xiiiqx4ggswf1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=53fff204f1cf323d6aeecd7449e640b8d1094f49

Brokers thrive on inefficiency: A shipper with 10 pallets needs a ride? **Broker calls 50 carriers (MY OLD JOB)**, locks the cheapest/fastest, and pockets the spread. It's regulated (FMCSA bonds required), with contracts spelling out liabilities. No broker = shippers hunt carriers themselves, wasting time. Carriers love 'em for steady loads; shippers for hassle-free scaling.

# How DoorDash Slots In: Broker Vibes in the Food Game

DoorDash? Straight-up a digital broker in this ecosystem, just faster and hungrier. They don't own restaurants or cars—they're the connector app greasing the wheels for last-mile food hauls. Here's the mapping:

* **DoorDash as Broker:** The hub. They market to customers, snag orders via the app, and dispatch to the nearest ""carrier."" No kitchens, no fleets—just algorithms matching supply/demand. They take 15–30% commissions from restaurants (plus fees), then pay out drivers from the pot. Like a freight broker, their value is the network: 4,000+ cities, millions of users. But unlike trad brokers, they control the tech (and the data), letting them tweak pay on the fly.
* **Restaurants as Shippers**: The origin point. They ""ship"" the food—prep orders, bag 'em hot, hand off at the door. They're paying DoorDash for exposure and volume (that sweet app traffic), just like a factory pays a broker to offload inventory. No direct say in delivery; they trust the broker's system. (Pro tip: Some spots act entitled 'cause they forget you're not their employee—you're fulfilling the broker's gig.)
* **You (1099 Drivers) as Carriers:** The muscle. You're the independent haulers with your own ""rig"" (car, bike, scooter). DoorDash books you for the load, you pick up from the shipper, drop at the end point, and get paid per haul (base + mileage + tip). Like truckers, you're contracted per job—no salary, just earnings potential. But here's the gig twist: Brokers in trad logistics can't deactivate carriers for picky loads (antitrust vibes), and neither can DoorDash legally for declines. You're not locked in; log off anytime.

In the end, Dashers, this setup empowers you as the carrier—vet those orders like a pro trucker scouting freight boards. Decline the duds, stack the winners, and remember: The broker needs us more than we need their pings. Hit the roads smarter, stay legal, and let's push for that trad-level respect. What's your wildest decline story? Drop it below—community over algorithms.

# DoorDash Driver Profitability: Earnings Per Mile and $2 Orders

DoorDash drivers (Dashers) are independent contractors, so profitability depends on covering vehicle expenses, taxes, and time while aiming for a livable wage. Based on 2025 data, I'll break down the key metrics for each question. Averages vary by location, vehicle efficiency, and market (e.g., urban vs. rural), but I'll use industry standards from IRS rates and driver reports.

# How Much Should a DoorDash Driver Make Per Mile to Turn a Profit?

To turn a profit, your gross earnings per mile (total payout divided by miles driven on the delivery) should exceed your expenses per mile plus a buffer for taxes (self-employment tax \~15.3%) and desired hourly wage.

* Average Expenses Per Mile (2025): The IRS standard mileage rate is 70 cents per mile, which bundles gas, oil, repairs, tires, insurance, registration, and depreciation. This is a reliable proxy for gig drivers—actual costs might range $0.50–$0.90/mile depending on your car (e.g., a fuel-efficient hybrid vs. a gas guzzler) and local gas prices (\~$3.50/gallon average). Break it down like this:

https://preview.redd.it/eb7kg3qciswf1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbdec87bad6acc5d0c8296cbb5bdddf1c365cf3f

* Minimum for Profit: Aim for $1.00–$1.50 per mile gross to break even after expenses and taxes, leaving room for $15–$20/hour net (a modest living wage in many areas).
   * At $1/mile: Covers costs but slim margins—viable for quick, tipped orders in high-demand zones.
   * At $1.50+/mile: Sustainable profit; top earners hit $2+/mile by cherry-picking.
   * Driver consensus: Decline anything under $1/mile; $2/mile base pay is ideal for longer hauls.

Example: A 5-mile order paying $7 gross ($1.40/mile) after 70¢ expenses leaves \~$3.50 profit—but factor in unpaid wait/deadhead miles, which dilute this.

# Can a DoorDash Driver Make a Living Accepting $2.00 Orders?

No, not sustainably as a primary strategy—accepting orders with only $2 total payout (base pay without meaningful tips or promotions) rarely covers costs, let alone supports a full-time living (\~$40,000–$60,000/year after expenses for 40 hours/week). Here's why:

* What $2 Orders Mean: DoorDash's base pay starts at $2 per order (up to $10+ for long/desirable ones), but total payout = base + 100% tips + peak pay/promotions. A flat $2 order implies little/no tip and short distance (1–2 miles), yielding $1–$2/mile gross at best. After 70¢/mile expenses, that's pennies—or a loss if wait times eat into it.

# To make a living: Focus on $1.50+/mile orders during peaks (lunch/dinner), multi-apping (e.g., with Uber Eats), and zones with 20–30% tip rates. In 2025, full-timers average $45,000–$65,000 gross, but only by optimizing—not scraping $2 offers. 

# If you're starting, test markets and track for 1–2 weeks before committing full-time.",3,1761193592.0,DoorDashDrivers,6,1.0,False

I think the stress is showing in my spending,"Just checked my Oct expenses and hit a new personal coffee record of $372.43 in 23 days, Not a huge amount but definitely a new record for me.

Running a one-man accounting consultancy, so I work from coffee shops a lot. My home office makes me want to take naps, so the coffee shop is my default workspace. Some are client meetings where I'll treat, but tbh most is just me buying coffee multiple times a day to stay functional.

Looking at the frequency though, I think the stress is really showing. There are days where I hit the same place two or three times when I'm grinding through something. It's been a chaotic month with that one nightmare client taking up way too much headspace, and apparently caffeine is my coping mechanism.

Current pace has me hitting around $480 by eom, which works out to almost $6k annually. The accountant part of my brain sees these numbers and wants to intervene. The exhausted business owner part just wants another latte.

I keep telling myself coffee shop rent is cheaper than actual office space, but at some point i shud prolly admit this is more about stress management than workspace strategy. (Maybe I should get a coffee machine subscription instead) What's your monthly coffee spending looking like? Does it spike when things get chaotic or is it just me?

1odtwe7,https://v.redd.it/gykyhuxxcswf1,Are There Health Benefits to Drinking Green Tea?,"# Are There Health Benefits to Drinking Green Tea?

# What Is Green Tea?

It's a beverage or dietary supplement that may improve your mental alertness, ease your digestive symptoms and headaches, and help you with weight loss.

It’s been a popular drink as well as a traditional medicine in China and Japan for thousands of years. Early in the 17th century, it was introduced to consumers in Europe who instantly welcomed the beverage. In 18th century England, green tea was so valuable and popular that it was often smuggled in to avoid taxes.

 

These days, there’s no need to resort to smuggling. Green tea is widely available across the globe. Dozens of brands of bagged green tea can be found on store shelves, blended from a variety of green tea. There are flavored and sweetened varieties, as well as green tea powder and loose leaf tea. Whatever way you want to drink green tea, there’s probably a product already on the market.

 

Green tea is often consumed for reasons other than its possible health benefits. But there’s actually quite a lot happening in a cup of green tea, and it’s worth getting to the bottom of.

 

# Green Tea Nutrition

While there are many compounds, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals in green tea leaves, those elements are extremely diluted in a single cup of tea. Once steeped, the resulting green tea beverage is almost entirely water.

 

There are less than 3 calories in 8 fluid ounces of green tea and no measurable amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, or sugar.

Vitamins and minerals found in green tea are also minimal. A few that can be found in small quantities include:

· Calcium

· Iron

· Potassium

Green tea does pack a potent punch of polyphenols, a type of antioxidants.

“Green tea contains polyphenols, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), that may play a role in protecting against cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and has also been associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline,” says Rachelle LaCroix Mallik, RD, LDN, a Chicago based dietitian.

# Does green tea have caffeine?

[Yes.As](http://Yes.As) a caffeine-rich drink, it may pose a risk to people with diabetes. Caffeine has been shown to potentially raise blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. As for the amounts, 8 fluid ounces of green tea has about 28 milligrams of caffeine. That’s compared with 47 milligrams of caffeine for the same amount of black tea and 96 milligrams of caffeine for the same amount of coffee.

# Green tea vs. black tea

Green and black tea come from the same plant, *Camellia sinensis*. The difference is how the leaves are handled after harvest.

Green tea leaves are heated and dried right away. This stops them from fermenting, so they stay lighter in color and taste.

Black tea leaves are left to ferment, which means they sit in the air and react with oxygen. This natural change makes them darker and gives the tea a stronger flavor.

Both teas have antioxidants and caffeine but in different forms.

“Green and black teas are both ‘true teas,’ unlike herbal teas, and naturally contain caffeine,” Mallik says. “Brewed green tea typically has less caffeine than black, with the exception of matcha, which is made from ground whole tea leaves and is more concentrated.”

# Green Tea Benefits

Many health benefit claims have been made about green tea for centuries. Traditionally, in China and India, green tea was a medicine for controlling bleeding, aiding digestion, and regulating body temperature. In modern times, research has been able to show some of its health benefits more solidly than others.

# Heart health

One large study in Japan followed 40,000 adult participants over 11 years and showed that daily consumption of green tea was linked to a low risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. In particular, the study examined the link between polyphenols (antioxidants) in green tea and cardiovascular diseases. The minimum daily consumption needed to see this benefit was five cups per day.

# Diabetes

Green tea can help regulate your blood sugar levels. It lowers your fasting blood sugar and HbA1c when you have type 2 diabetes.

# Stroke prevention

Another large Japanese study, this one following more than 82,000 participants over 13 years, showed that higher consumption rates of green tea were associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Participants who drank four cups or more per day saw the highest benefit.

# Genital wart treatment

The FDA has approved a topical green tea extract treatment to treat breakouts of genital warts. This ointment is available by prescription only, and it is estimated to be effective for 24%-60% of patients.

# Benefits for your skin

Studies show green tea may have anti-inflammatory and anticancer benefits that may help you have healthier skin. Their findings suggest skin products with green tea in them may be good for you. But more research is needed.

# Green tea and ginger

Both green tea and ginger have been shown to have health benefits when ingested on their own. Throughout history, green tea has been thought to aid in digestion, regulate body temperature, and control bleeding. For centuries, ginger has been used to treat digestive problems, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and menstrual symptoms. Scientific studies support its ability to ease nausea and vomiting linked to pregnancy, surgery, cancer therapy, and motion sickness. Ginger is also proven to lower inflammation and pain. So, it’s not surprising to think that ginger and green tea would have health benefits when had together.

# Weight loss

Some studies show that green tea and ginger may help with weight loss. In one study, weight loss capsules containing green tea, ginger, and capsaicin (the spicy component of chili peppers) were much more effective in promoting weight loss than a placebo.

But more research is needed to know how much the capsaicin contributed to those results.

# Green Tea Benefits for Women

Some studies suggest higher green tea intake can lower the odds of getting breast cancer or having a recurrence. But more research is needed to understand the link.

Mallik notes a Japanese study where women with early-stage breast cancer who drank three to five cups daily before diagnosis had a 44% lower risk of their cancer coming back compared to non-tea drinkers.

Green tea with or without ginger is sometimes used to ease painful periods. It may also help with conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), though the science is limited.

# Green Tea Benefits for Men

Some research points to a lower risk of prostate cancer in men who drink more green tea, but results have been mixed.

There’s some evidence that drinking green tea over time may help with healthy aging. Studies suggest it could ease inflammation linked to depression, support weight control, and improve testosterone levels in middle-aged and older men.

Green tea has also been tied to lower risk of cognitive decline. One study on older Japanese adults found that men and women who drank three or more glasses a day were less likely to develop dementia. More research is still needed to learn if there’s a causal link.

# Green Tea Side Effects

There isn't much evidence that drinking green tea and ginger could be harmful. But too much ginger can cause diarrhea, heartburn, and even an irregular heartbeat. While it would be pretty hard to overdose on ginger by drinking ginger and green tea, it’s much easier to do so by taking diet pills that promote their green tea and ginger content.

Always check with your doctor before taking supplements, and follow dosing instructions carefully. Drinking eight cups per day or less of green tea is considered safe for most adults. But there are risks posed by drinking green tea in high concentrations, especially as an extract.

In rare cases, green tea extract may cause liver problems. While the research is limited, you should avoid green tea extract if you have liver problems.

Stop taking green tea extract and contact your doctor if you have abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice.

# What is the daily amount of green tea that is considered safe?

There’s no max limit. But most research suggests three to five cups per day is safe for healthy adults and may offer the greatest benefits. And if you’re sensitive to caffeine, you may not want to drink that much. 

“For folks who cannot tolerate larger amounts of green tea, even just one or more cups per day has been linked with a lower overall cancer risk compared to less than one cup per day,” Mallik says.

Supplements and extracts can deliver much higher doses and may come with more risks and side effects, so always check with your doctor before using them.

# How to Make Green Tea

Use these ingredients to make green tea:

· 3 cups filtered water

· 4 green tea bags

· 1 tablespoon ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced

· 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 4 slices for garnish

· 2 tablespoons honey

Then follow these directions:

1. Bring water to just below boiling point. Remove from heat.

2. Place tea bags in a pitcher, and add ginger slices. Pour hot water over the tea bags. Let them steep for 8-10 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Stir in lemon juice and honey.

3. Serve warm or iced.

There’s no evidence that, health-wise, it matters when you drink green tea. That’s a matter of your personal preference.

# Takeaways

Green tea is low in calories and rich in plant compounds called antioxidants. Drinking a few cups a day may support heart, brain, and blood sugar health. It has less caffeine than coffee or black tea.

Most people can drink green tea safely, but high-dose extracts may cause problems.

Think of green tea as a healthy choice, but not a cure-all.

# Green Tea FAQs

# What diseases does green tea fight?

Studies suggest green may help with obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. Most of this evidence is stronger in lab and animal studies. More research in people is still needed.

# What cannot be taken with green tea?

Green tea, whether caffeinated or decaf, can reduce iron absorption. So, it’s best to take iron supplements separately. Green tea may interact with some medications, including those used to treat high blood pressure, heart problems, and osteoporosis. Ask your doctor what’s safe.

# Is it good to drink green tea on an empty stomach?

Yes, it’s fine for most people. But there’s no proof you’ll get more health benefits this way. If you have low iron, your doctor may suggest you drink green tea between meals instead of with food.",1,1761193397.0,KungFuteas,0,1.0,False
1odtw0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1odtw0x/tifu_by_using_my_bosss_bathroom/,TIFU by using my boss’s bathroom,"
So this happened yesterday.

I was working from my boss’s house because our office is under renovation, and he’s one of those “we’re all family here” kind of guys. Around noon, coffee hit my stomach like a freight train. I politely asked to use his bathroom, which he said was “right upstairs, first door on the left.”

I finish my business, flush, and immediately hear glug glug GLUG. The water starts rising. Fast. I panic. I jiggle the handle, nothing. It keeps rising until it’s flirting with the rim. I grab the plunger by instinct and start plunging like my job depends on it (which, at that point, it might’ve).

I realize too late, it’s not a plunger. It’s one of those toilet brushes. I’m swirling chaos around like a witch in a cauldron. The water spills over. I’m on my knees mopping with the guest towels when I hear a knock. It’s my boss: “Everything okay in there?”

I open the door like a war survivor. His pristine marble bathroom now looks like a swamp crime scene. He just sighed and said, “That’s… not the first time that toilet’s taken a life.”

TL;DR: Clogged my boss’s fancy toilet, mistook a toilet brush for a plunger, and baptized his guest towels in sewage water.",4,1761193361.0,tifu,9,0.52,False

I started taking probiotics, exercising and eating better. All to prepare to get off Nexium and Pepcid. I was off of everything for at least a year before I started to taper so I thought I would be ok. I was for a while.
