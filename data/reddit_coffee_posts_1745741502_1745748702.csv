1k90loa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agronomics_Investors/comments/1k90loa/bullish_factors_i_see_for_agronomics/,Bullish Factors I see for Agronomics,"Hi,

So I am just putting together the bullish factors I see for the cellular agriculture industry in general right now, and compiling this for both myself and to hear other people's opinions.

So one of the main drivers I think of the cellular agricultural space is climate change. Not in terms of preventing climate change, but in terms of climate change is already severely negatively affecting agriculture. I trust there are no Maga/Russian bot climate change deniers here, if there are I'm just going to ignore them. Instances of climate change affecting yields can be seen in coffee and chocolate right now, with arabica beans haven risen 80% in a year,and chocolate futures having risen 400% in 2024.

  
One bull flag for this, that is not discussed is this meat, will be critical to the new world order. America produces three things mainly, defense tech, tech services and agriculture. In a future world order where there is less cooperation due to climate change impacting natural resources, reliance on agricultural imports will be seen as a liability. This is already happening in proper countries like Singapore/China and Saudi Arabia moving into this space to reduce reliance on agricultural imports. 

  
Another big driver of the industry at some point is space, people will either kill each other or eventually make it to space. In the event in which people make it to space, current agriculture will not be applicable and will be replaced by cellular agriculture. This to me is a certainty of the space industry. 

  
Whether or not this takes off in America remains to be seen, as Americans have become extremely conservative (read only believe in conspiracy theories from their local meth head). This is its own issue and in my opinion as long as countries that embrace science go ahead with this the industry will eventually thrive. As long as this technology develops in one country I believe that it will eventually become efficient enough that other countries will have to adopt it, to stop reliance on increasing subsidies for farming due to climate change.

1k90kyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive_islam/comments/1k90kyi/assalamu_alaikum_strap_in_for_this_roller_coaster/,"Assalamu Alaikum, strap in for this roller coaster.","Point blank, I need practical guidance. I work 2 jobs(2nd shift and 3rd shift), I am amidst a divorce, and I drive my kids(who live with their mom) anywhere they need to go(their mom SR doesn't drive). Admittedly, when SR cheated this most recent time I had to move out and stay out. My children live with her as a result. The second job is to fund the divorce and childsupport, while any extra from it is to be used to save a mahr. I barely can save anything because my hours went down, way down. I am consumed with costs, and have no free time. I only have 2 hours to sleep per day, give or take with traffic delays or conversations. My second job causes me to sleep from 11am to 230pm, as it starts at 4pm and the commute is 35 minutes. It ends at 10pm, and my other job starts at 11pm. In between jobs I have to drive 25 minutes to SR's mother's house to pickup the kids and take them to SR. Taking them from her mom to her is a 15 minute drive, and then it's a 30 minute drive from SR's house to my second job. I have to fly in order to make it to either job on time, because it's nearly impossible to wake up when you've had 2 hours of sleep in a 48 hour period and you just fell asleep for an hour and a half. You're in REM sleep, not designed to wake during that time. 

Haha did you think that was my issue? No I'm just getting started. My other job it's 11pm-7am. after that I go straight back to SR's house to grab the kids and take them back to their mother. SR doesn't drive, her job is half way between her house and her mother's, and it's literally on the road that takes you there. SR works at 930, so I usually grab breakfast or try to take a nap or make up some prayers or something while I wait that weird amount of time. it's usually, I get them around 845-9 and take SR on the way to drop the kids. I get home at 10-1030, if I have nothing to do like go to the store or bank or something like that with businesses that close at night. 

But wait, we're not into the thick of it yet guys.

I need guidance.

Assalamu Alaikum wr wb akhis and ukhtis. May Allah bless us all, guide each and every one of us, and reward us for our efforts in the Deen and duyna, Insha Allah. 

I am a revert of 1 year. My life is falling apart. prepare your mind, to walk in my shoes. I am American. I am 26 and I have adhd. I have two kids under age 6, that live with their mother. We are going through a divorce. She is not Muslim or a woman of the book, she keeps dogs, she cheated on me countless times with 11 different men over the course of the 11 years we were together. Not ""one night stands"". Full blown relationships. She does not keep the house clean. We will call her SR.

I reverted last year in the spring, in the last days of ramadan. I had 1 job, security guard. Divorce already initiated, still living with kids and ex. I met a woman online, she was a barely practicing Muslim woman. Allah called me to Islam through her and our mutual friends, but I did not revert for this woman I reverted because I believed what I read for myself. We'll call her NB. I got a second job to support my future with NB. I paid NB a mahr. Both she and I viewed our meeting as divine, and our status with eachother as ""meant to be"". What do I mean? We didn't meet on a dating site, or anything similar or remotely close. We were randomly matched as teammates on a game, a phone game. Being the best teammate eachother ever had, we added eachother, played for weeks, then became close friends, then became romantic. NB is Somali, living in a country that neighbors mine. We fell deeply in love, and discussed marriage, and had our obstacles(like my current divorce). Remember though, I paid her a mahr. I decide to go see her, and marry her while I am there, and then we figure out the steps that follow when we are sitting in a room, brain power activated. Together we plan the trip and everything. I am to go and stay with her, because we will go from the airport to the Masjid in her car. The total cost of the trip was supposed to be like 1100, so I bought my ticket (800) and brought 700. As soon as the plane landed it's ""oh I'm sick. oh you can't come over my son is sick. oh were going to the hospital."" Okay cool, no worries I got extra money. long story short, my week long trip I didn't see her one time, let alone marry her. This killed me, almost literally. I walked in front of a train and someone pulled me away. In total, I racked up 3500+ in debt on the trip, with credit cards so riba. the 3500 plus the 800  plus the mahr. She's got about half the money I've made in a year invested into a marriage with her. Somewhere in the mix, both jobs put a limit on hours so my income got cut in half, because I was living off of the overtime pay. My regular pay at either job is too low to survive on alone because of the overtime rule. She won't commit to coming to my city, or to marrying me.I ask her are you my fiance? she said ""almost, we are in the promise to stage"". AstaghfirUllah. What the hell? AstaghfirUllah. ever since that trip, last November, I haven't been the same. I always prayed for marriage with her so prayer is something I can barely do. I made it a point to end my salat with a dua to marry NB and free me from SR. Another effect of the trip, NB only messages about 3 texts per week now. 

Fast forward to when I think I'm strong enough to lose NB(a month ago). I go to the Masjid for jumuah and make dua, "" please take away what is not good for me and give me what I need. I am so lonely. I fear the sin and the punishment. I don't want your displeasure. I am so lonely ya rabb. I need a halal partner, I think. You know best Allah"". It was something like that, but not word for word. After Jumuah, habibi approaches me and asks I'd I want a wife! I say yes, we sit down and talk. This sister we will call J. She is a 2 year revert and she is the most strict Muslim I have met so far. How strict? Habibi she wouldn't look me in the eye, only at the wall. She asked me if it is permissible to look at my face. J barely spoke. I'd say 5 paragraphs, and she's say 3 words. Our meeting was wonderful and she asked me ""how do we move forward in a halal way"". we left the Masjid, and two days later the imam tells me she declined me for marriage, I left my number for her in the imams office. Three days later she messaged me. We chatted about 10 messages per day for 9 days. the 9th day we had planned something special. 

J and I were supposed to go to the Masjid for jumuah separately, speak before jumuah and after. then she ride to my job with me, then when my shift ends I take her home. We asked the imam, he said she can ride in the back seat if I drive. that is the plan. Now let me tell you what happened. 

I go the the mosque with 2 coffees. She's not there. i message her twice, like where are you, but get no answer. I pray. I make dua. I leave prayer room and find the brother that set me up with her randomly. He asks me how it went. I explain. He says,"" I will find her and talk to her"". He finds her, talks to her, brings her to me, and we sit down to talk. Notice how I didn't ask for any of this so far? Cool, because I noticed. Anyways, we chat and she says she intends on still going through with our plan. We drink our less hot coffees, and then head to the car in the rain. We go to my restaurant job. I introduce her to my coworkers. I am in the USA, and I work in a halal certified restaurant. On that shift, there was a khaffur woman working, a Muslim woman working, myself, and a Muslim man working. She is excited to meet them, and they are excited to meet her. We chat for half an hour, I make her some food, and then cook a few orders and make myself something. Time for Asr is soon, so I come to her and show her where she can pray, and give her my brand new personal prayer mat. This way she doesn't have to pray on the floor or on a rug that smells like fish. She thanks me and then an order comes, then another, now the rush is starting. I cook for 15 minutes and then notice it is time for the adhan for Asr. She is gone. Backpack, food, drink, everything just gone. 20 minutes rolls by and I havent seen her, so now I look for her. I find her praying. I immediately leave of course. she prays for 30 minutes, and then comes to my and whispers from 10 feet away, then turns to leave the restaurant. I was like ""hey J, what did you say habibti? Are you leaving???"". 

She says ""my family is here to get me, I am leaving now. Salam Alaikum."". I said ""wa alaikum assalam, I had a wonderful time. Masha Allah  take care of yourself and I hope to see you again soon. this was a fantastic meeting!"" she turns to the door and says ""alhamdulilah"". So I message her curious about why she left and all. She said ""I think this is haram. I don't think we should text or speak anymore. I dont think we should get married"". 

Guys, brothers, men. I need a woman. I have been trying the right way. My manhood throbs and aches. I fear sin. I was with SR for 11 years, having it whenever and however I wanted. I had the physical needs satisfied and the emotional needs satisfied. I had the comforting food at home, somewhere to call home, and someone to watch the kids while I was working. Now I don't even have the kids, or a bed, or a home, or a permissible partner. I don't have money for the divorce even so it's been somewhat ""paused"". I don't have any money any more, but somehow I also never have time. I miss so many salat due to my restaurant job, that it's a habit to just miss prayers. If you are tracking, I have 3 things keeping me from Salah. Job, adhd, depression (Due to always praying for NB, and her treating me like this). Salah is a depression trigger, and an obstacle for my customers. I am in America, so nobody ""understands"" when their food is 20 minutes late because you needed wudu and 4 rakah. The NB relation to prayer is actual depression. I already had actual medical depression long before Islam. NB is a trauma for me, and salat is a trigger. I have Major Depressive Disorder as well as ADHD. 

I need guidance, support, and a woman. Does anyone have a thought that could help me? I spent most of last night crying my eyes out because J said all of those things, out of nowhere, in the middle of our halal meeting for marriage. I feel Allah will never give me a spouse. I am not angry, just lonely and sad. I need someone so bad. I fear sin, and I fear the wrath of Allah. 

If you are wondering, NB hurt the worst because she found me at my lowest, brought me higher, and then decimated me. Now I view nothing the same, and that is due to Islam and her and pain. So really it's all because of her. I can't even pray man. I want to, but I can't. I know it's not, but to my brain even making wudu is this super long process that will take all day just to make me wet. I am no khaffir though, by any means. I make about a bazillion duaas a day, I do other acts of worship and I avoid sins to the best of my ability. I'm no broken soul, I can function. there is nothing wrong with me either, other than the issues other humans give me. I see no issues, and I seek no sins. Yet both find me frequently, and I'm too tired, sore, and heartbroken to do anything except let everything fall apart. Read my previous posts if there are any questions please, I've been battling this battle for a while to no fruition. Allah has given me signs, and silver linings, and rewarded my sabr. I'll tell you, my sabr battery is larger than most. Please do not tell me after hardship comes ease, or that I need more sabr. Wallahi, the amount of sabr I have used to this point has not been witnessed by most. Allah has given me plenty of Sabr, this is not an issue of patience. I need practical advice or help, to climb out if this tench I was kicked into. ",1,1745748513.0,progressive_islam,0,1.0,False

## Understanding Your Needs: Finding the Perfect Pink Silk PJ Set

Before diving into specific brands and styles,it's essential to consider what you're looking for in a pink silk pajama set. Are you prioritizing ultimate luxury, or are you seeking an affordable option that still offers a touch of silk's signature feel? Consider these key factors:

*   **Material:** While the goal is silk, even within silk there are variations. Mulberry silk pink pajamas are often considered the highest quality due to its long fibers and smooth texture. Pay attention to the silk weight (momme) – higher momme counts indicate a denser, more durable fabric. You might also encounter pink satin pajama set options. While satin *can* be silk, it's often a polyester blend mimicking the look of silk, and will lack the breathability and luxurious feel.
*   **Style:** Pink silk pajamas are available in a variety of styles to suit different preferences.Opt for a classic long sleeve pink silk pajama set for cooler nights, or a short sleeve pink silk pajama set for warmer weather.A pink silk cami pajama set is a lightweight and feminine choice perfect for summer, while a silk pajama shorts set pink offers a playful and agreeable option.
*   **Fit:** Consider your preferred fit – do you like your pajamas loose and flowing, or more fitted and tailored? Look for brands that offer a range of sizes, including pink silk pajama set plus size options, to ensure a comfortable and flattering fit.
*   **Care:** Silk can be delicate, so consider whether you prefer washable silk pink pajamas or if you're willing to commit to dry cleaning. Machine washable pink silk pajamas are a convenient option for everyday wear, but always follow the care instructions carefully to preserve the fabric's quality.
*   **Occasion:** Are you purchasing these for everyday wear, or for a special event? Wedding pink silk pajamas or bridesmaid pink silk pajamas often feature exquisite detailing and come in sets designed for gifting and photo opportunities. A pink silk pajama set gift is a thoughtful and luxurious present for birthdays, holidays, or any special occasion.

## Choosing the right Shade of Pink

pink is far from a monolith. The beauty of pink silk pajamas lies in the spectrum of shades they come in. Here are some tips for choosing the right shade of pink for you:

Practical Steps on How to Improve Marriage Life for Lasting Happiness
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the Foundations of a Strong Marriage

To improve marriage life effectively, it's essential to recognize that lasting happiness grows from a solid foundation. Couples who actively nurture trust, communication, and respect lay the groundwork for a thriving relationship. You can start with honesty and openness, sharing your thoughts and feelings regularly with your partner. This openness helps both of you feel connected and understood, which is vital for emotional intimacy.

### Simple Daily Habits to Strengthen Your Bond

In busy lives, small everyday actions have a big impact on how your marriage flourishes. Here are practical daily habits you can adopt right now:

- **Express appreciation:** Tell your spouse what you admire or value about them. A simple thank you for daily tasks or kind gestures encourages positivity.
- **Spend quality time:** Dedicate focused moments to each other without distractions like phones or TV. Even 10-15 minutes of meaningful conversation can deepen your connection.
- **Offer physical affection:** Hugging, holding hands, or gentle touches release oxytocin, the ""bonding hormone,"" which strengthens emotional ties.
- **Listen actively:** When your partner speaks, listen fully rather than planning your response. This shows respect and fosters empathy between you.
- **Share responsibilities:** Divide household and life duties fairly to avoid resentment and show teamwork. Mutual support eases stress and builds unity.

### Effective Communication Skills That Help Resolve Conflict

Conflict is inevitable, but how you handle disagreements determines the health of your marriage. Improving marriage life involves learning to communicate with kindness and clarity. Try these strategies:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Use “I” statements:** Instead of blaming, express how you feel about a situation. For example, say, “I feel hurt when…” rather than “You always…”
- **Stay calm:** Avoid yelling or harsh words, which escalate conflicts. Pause and take deep breaths if emotions run high, then return to the discussion when you’re calmer.
- **Focus on the issue:** Stick to the topic at hand instead of bringing up past mistakes or unrelated criticisms.
- **Seek solutions jointly:** Work together to find compromises or plans that satisfy both partners, fostering cooperation rather than competition.
- **Agree to disagree:** It’s okay to have differing opinions sometimes. Respecting each other's views without trying to “win” helps maintain harmony.

### Prioritizing Emotional and Physical Intimacy

Intimacy strengthens the marriage bond beyond daily routines. Emotional intimacy means sharing vulnerabilities and dreams, while physical intimacy includes sexual connection and affectionate touch. To improve these areas:

- **Make time for romantic moments:** Plan date nights or simple acts of romance that keep the spark alive.
- **Practice empathy and support:** Be there emotionally during tough times, showing care and understanding.
- **Communicate your needs clearly:** Talk about your desires and boundaries openly so your partner knows how to meet them.
- **Explore new experiences:** Trying new activities together, including in the bedroom, can refresh your relationship and deepen intimacy.

### Investing in Personal Growth and Shared Goals

Lasting happiness in marriage comes from growth individually and as a couple. Encourage each other to pursue personal passions and development while creating shared goals. This balanced approach keeps your connection dynamic and meaningful. Consider these tips:

- **Support learning and hobbies:** Cheer on your partner’s interests and make space for personal time.
- **Set joint goals:** Whether it's financial planning, travel dreams, or family planning, working towards shared objectives strengthens your partnership.
- **Celebrate successes:** Acknowledge achievements together, making your marriage a source of mutual pride and joy.

### Seeking Help When Needed

If your marriage faces serious challenges, seeking outside help is a wise and courageous step. Professional counseling or couples therapy provides tools and guidance to navigate difficulties and improve communication. Remember, asking for help doesn’t mean failure—it shows commitment to making your marriage better.

By consistently applying these practical steps, you nurture a marriage that supports lasting happiness. You will find that with effort, kindness, and understanding, your relationship can become more fulfilling and resilient over time.

Overcoming Common Challenges That Strain Marital Relationships
--------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Marriage can be a beautiful journey, but it often comes with challenges that test the strength of your relationship. Recognizing and addressing these common difficulties thoughtfully can help you create a deeper, more loving connection with your partner. If you want to improve your marriage life, understanding how to overcome stressors like communication breakdowns, financial worries, and emotional distance is a crucial step.

### Enhancing Communication for a Stronger Bond

One of the most frequent hurdles couples face is poor communication. When partners stop sharing openly, misunderstandings grow, and small issues can spiral into bigger conflicts. To overcome this, prioritize honest and respectful conversations. Make time daily to talk without distractions—put away phones and focus entirely on each other. Use “I” statements to express how you feel instead of blaming, such as “I feel hurt when plans change without talking” rather than “You never tell me anything.”

Listening actively also plays a critical role. Show genuine interest by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and reflecting back what your spouse says. This helps them feel heard and valued, which strengthens intimacy.

### Managing Financial Stress Together

Money problems are a leading cause of tension in marriages. Disagreements about spending, debts, or saving goals can create ongoing strain. To improve how you handle financial challenges, create a budget together and discuss your financial priorities openly. Being on the same page about money matters builds trust and reduces anxiety.

Try these steps to tackle financial stress as a team:

- Set clear monthly financial goals, including saving and spending limits.
- Share individual concerns about money without judgment.
- Review your budget regularly and adjust it as life changes.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor if needed.
 
When you treat financial hurdles as a shared challenge, you transform money from an opponent into an opportunity for partnership.

### Nurturing Emotional Connection Despite Busy Lives

Busy schedules, work demands, and family responsibilities make it easy to drift apart emotionally. Couples may feel disconnected when they don’t spend enough quality time together. To counteract this, make deliberate efforts to nurture your emotional connection.

Simple yet effective ways to keep your relationship thriving include:

- Regular date nights, even if they are simple activities at home.
- Expressing appreciation often through words or small gestures.
- Engaging in mutual hobbies or interests that bring joy to both.
- Creating rituals, like morning coffee together or evening check-ins.
 
These habits foster closeness and remind you of the reasons you fell in love in the first place.

### Resolving Conflicts Without Damaging Your Relationship

Conflicts are a natural part of marriage, but how you handle them matters a lot. Addressing disagreements calmly and constructively prevents resentment. Avoid yelling, name-calling, or bringing up past mistakes. Instead, focus on the issue at hand and aim to find solutions together.

Some key approaches include:

- Taking a timeout if emotions run too high, then returning to the conversation with a cooler mindset.
- Using “we” language to emphasize partnership – e.g., “How can we solve this?”
- Agreeing to compromises that respect both partners’ needs.
- Seeking professional help, like couples therapy, if conflicts keep repeating.
 
Remember, the goal is not to “win” but to strengthen your bond through respectful problem-solving.

### Balancing Individual Needs and Togetherness

Another challenge couples often face is finding a healthy balance between independence and togetherness. Spending too much time apart can create distance, but losing your individual identity can lead to frustration.

Encourage each other to maintain personal hobbies, friendships, and self-care routines. At the same time, dedicate specific times to enjoy shared activities and deepen your partnership. This balance promotes personal growth while keeping your marriage vibrant.

### Building Trust and Rekindling Intimacy

Trust forms the foundation of any strong marriage. If trust has been broken due to past mistakes, be patient and consistent in rebuilding it. Open communication, transparency, and keeping promises help restore confidence.

Intimacy goes beyond physical closeness—it includes emotional and mental connection. Show empathy toward your spouse’s feelings, be affectionate, and make intimacy a priority, even when life gets busy. These efforts create a safe space where love can flourish.

By focusing on these areas—communication, financial teamwork, emotional nurturing, conflict resolution, balancing needs, and trust—you can effectively overcome the everyday challenges that strain marital relationships. The key is to remain patient, committed, and willing to grow together through all seasons of your marriage.

</div>### Conclusion

Building a strong and happy marriage takes effort, but the rewards are well worth it. By taking practical steps such as improving communication, investing quality time together, and showing appreciation, you create a foundation of lasting happiness. These actions help deepen your connection and keep your relationship resilient through life’s ups and downs.

Every marriage faces challenges — whether it’s misunderstandings, stress, or changing priorities. Recognizing these struggles early and addressing them openly can prevent small problems from growing into bigger issues. Learning how to overcome common hurdles strengthens trust and brings you closer as partners.

Remember, improving your marriage is a journey you take together. It grows with patience, kindness, and willingness to understand each other. When you both commit to nurturing your relationship, you build a lasting bond based on love and respect.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best dough bowl candles offer a combination of aesthetic appeal, high-quality materials, and long-lasting fragrance. Several key features differentiate superior candles from the rest.

**Type of Wax:** The type of wax used in a dough bowl candle significantly impacts its burn time, scent throw, and overall quality.

Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burning properties, sustainability, and excellent scent retention. It's derived from soybeans, making it a renewable resource. Paraffin wax, a petroleum byproduct, is another common option, known for its ability to hold a strong scent. However, it may produce more soot and release potentially harmful chemicals when burned. Beeswax is a natural option that burns cleanly and emits a subtle honey scent, but it's typically more expensive. A blend of waxes is also used to balance the benefits of different materials.

**Bowl Material and Design:** The dough bowl itself is a crucial aspect of the candle's overall appeal.

Genuine antique dough bowls are highly sought after for their unique character and history, but they can be expensive and difficult to find. Replica dough bowls, crafted from wood or other materials like resin, offer a more affordable and readily available option. The design of the bowl varies widely, from rustic and weathered finishes to more polished and contemporary styles. Size, shape, and depth also play a role in the overall aesthetic and the amount of wax the bowl can hold.

**Scent Profile and Throw:** The scent of a dough bowl candle is a primary factor in its appeal, and its ""throw"" refers to how well the scent permeates the surrounding space.

A well-balanced scent profile should be pleasant and not overpowering. Top notes provide the initial impression, while middle notes form the heart of the fragrance, and base notes provide depth and longevity. The scent throw depends on the type and amount of fragrance oil used, as well as the wax type and wick size. Stronger scents are suitable for larger rooms, while more subtle fragrances are ideal for smaller spaces.

**Wick Type and Number:** The type and number of wicks in a dough bowl candle directly influence its burn performance and scent diffusion.

Cotton wicks are a traditional choice that provides a consistent flame and good scent throw. Wood wicks offer a crackling sound that adds to the ambiance, but they may require more maintenance and can sometimes be more prone to smoking. The number of wicks depends on the size of the dough bowl; larger bowls typically require multiple wicks to ensure even burning and prevent tunneling (when the wax only melts in the center).

Key features of the best dough bowl candles include:
* High-quality wax blend for clean burning and strong scent throw
* Authentic or well-crafted replica dough bowl
* Balanced and pleasing fragrance profile
* Properly sized and positioned wicks for even burning

 ## Core Benefits

Dough bowl candles offer several benefits beyond simply providing light and fragrance. They enhance the ambiance of a space, serve as decorative accents, and offer a unique sensory experience.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** Dough bowl candles create a warm and inviting atmosphere in any room. The combination of the flickering flame, the rustic charm of the dough bowl, and the comforting scent contributes to a sense of relaxation and coziness.

**Decorative Accent:** Dough bowl candles serve as stylish decorative accents that complement a variety of interior design styles. Their unique shape and texture add visual interest to any space, whether placed on a coffee table, mantel, or dining table.

The versatility of dough bowl candles allows them to blend seamlessly with various d茅cor themes, from rustic farmhouse to modern minimalist. They can be customized with different scents and colors to match your personal style and preferences. The bowls themselves can be repurposed after the candle has burned, adding to their long-term value as decorative items.

**Aromatherapy and Relaxation:** The scents of dough bowl candles can have therapeutic benefits, promoting relaxation, reducing stress, and improving mood. Different fragrances have different effects on the mind and body, allowing you to customize your candle experience to suit your needs.

Lavender is known for its calming and sleep-inducing properties, while citrus scents can be energizing and uplifting. Vanilla creates a warm and comforting atmosphere, while eucalyptus can help to clear nasal passages and improve breathing. By choosing the right scent, you can create a personalized aromatherapy experience that enhances your well-being.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about dough bowl candles:

**How long do dough bowl candles typically burn?**

Burn time depends on the size of the dough bowl, the type of wax used, and the number of wicks. Smaller dough bowl candles may burn for 30-50 hours, while larger ones can burn for 80-100 hours or more. Proper wick trimming is essential to maximize burn time and prevent smoking.

Never leave a burning candle unattended, and keep it out of reach of children and pets. Trim the wicks regularly to prevent smoking and ensure even burning.

**Can dough bowls be refilled after the candle has burned out?**

Yes, many people choose to refill their dough bowls with wax after the original candle has burned out. You can purchase candle-making supplies online or at craft stores and create your own custom scents and wax blends. Alternatively, you can repurpose the dough bowl as a decorative item, such as a planter or a storage container.

**What are some popular scents for dough bowl candles?**

Popular scents for dough bowl candles include warm and comforting fragrances like vanilla, cinnamon, and sandalwood, as well as fresh and clean scents like lavender, citrus, and sea salt.

My doctor and dentist don't know what's wrong, I have been referred to specialists and still don't have an explanation. I am at my wits end with this, it is ruining my life and I'm really struggling to cope with not having a diagnosis. The timeline is long and a bit convoluted so there is a tldr, additional notes and then a full timeline broken down by dates at the end. Any advice, recommendations on what tests to ask for and/or other specialists to see is very much appreciated. I am desperate to resolve this

TL:DR: Developed a lump sensation in the throat and extremely bad breath, strong enough to smell when speaking. Tested positive for H. pylori and completed antibiotic treatment, but symptoms persisted. Contracted COVID, then a filling was placed in my tooth. Taste issues began after these events. Second round of antibiotics temporarily cleared the bad breath, but taste symptoms remained the whole time. Bad breath returned shortly after stopping treatment leading me to suspect these are two different problems? Possible gut health issues?

Multiple tests including gastroscopy, ENT camera exam, MRIs, and repeated H. pylori tests were all normal. Filling was eventually removed due to suspected allergy, but no improvement. Oral hygiene is excellent, no signs of dental infection or visible issues in mouth.

Referred to an oral specialist who downplayed symptoms, attributed them to mental health, and prescribed alpha lipoic acid and zinc, which have not helped.

**Other things to note:**

* I am 164cm weighing 68kgs, I am caucasian, born in South Africa, lived in Aus for 22 years
* Eating sugar causes mouth taste to become much worse
* I have had scalloping on the sides of my tongue since the taste started
* Taste is not there when I am eating. I have no distortion to taste for any foods (salty, sweet etc)
* I do not take regular medication other than iron and b12 supplements which I have taken for years
* Doctors have recommended mints and mouthwash to help. All it does is make my mouth minty on top of the weird taste, provides no relief
* I have tried removing things from my diet over the last year in case it’s an allergy. Over different periods, I have cut out coffee, sugar, soft drinks, spicy foods, greasy foods, oats, nuts; all to no avail
* I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs
* I have a tongue piercing that is 9 years old, doctor suspected this was the cause, removed for 2 months and no improvements so that is not the cause
* I am wondering if these problems are caused by my gut health. Maybe the antibiotics wrecked my gut and it has not recovered? 
   * I consistently take probiotics, currently taking Henry blooms SB and bioglan 30 billion. Have changed brands/types since this began and nothing helps, have stopped taking for a while which also didn't improve symptoms
   * I eat yoghurt, I drink water kefir 
* Haven’t seen a neurologist yet, I do not believe this is all in my head
* I have hernia mesh in my stomach since March 2023, no complications
* I exercise 3-5 times a week

**Following tests have been done and have all come back within normal ranges:**

* Electrolytes
* B12
* Copper
* Zinc (just above lowest acceptable interval)
* Thyroid
* Liver function
* Kidney function
* Glucose
* Lipase
* Folic acid
* Complete blood count
* Cortisol

* Went out to dinner, some chilli hit the back of my throat, caused coughing and had to sip water for a while to relieve burning

25th Feb 24

* Throat felt like it had a lump in it, assumed it was irritation from dinner

1st March 24

* Lump feeling persisted and extremely bad breath appeared (so bad I could smell it when I talked), assumed I had something stuck in my throat
* Went to doctor, he said it will go away with time

11th March 24

* Symptoms persisted along with nausea, bloating, constant feeling like I’m about to throw up, ears felt full
* Went back to doctor, prescribed PPI, I took it for a week, first few days helped relieve symptoms slightly but then stopped helping

26th March 24

* Symptoms persisted 
* Went back to doctor, asked for more testing, he refused and said continue with PPI, also given referral to ENT. Called 7 ENT locations and all had a 3 month wait

27th March 24

* Went to dentist for yearly clean, they said I needed a filling (important later)

10th April 24

* Went to see another doctor for a second opinion as I didn’t want to wait 3 months for ENT. She referred me to get a helicobacter pylori test
* Test was positive
* Prescribed the 7 day Esomeprazole Sandoz Hp7 treatment
* 4 weeks later, test for pylori came back negative. However, symptoms of bad breath and lump feeling persisted. The bad breath comes and goes, but is present more often than it is not.

7th April 24

* Went to dentist to have filling put in on the top of a back molar

15th May 24

* Got covid, wasn’t too unwell and have had it twice before this 

 29th May 24

* Went back to doctor for persistent symptoms, she diagnosed me with dysgeusia
* Referred me to get a gastroscopy (June 24)

17th June 24

* Went back to doctor as new symptom of mouth taste appeared. Initially tasted like metal, then tasted sweet. Now that I’ve had it for months, I can’t explain it anymore because I don’t know what normal taste is like. Sometimes it feels like my tongue feels as if it has been burnt

26th June 24

* Gastroscopy done, nothing found at all

22nd August 24

* Went back to doctor again as symptoms persisted
* Another pylori test done, negative

1st November 24

* Went back to doctor again as symptoms persisted
* Another pylori test done, negative

25th January 25

Went back to doctor again as symptoms persisted, referred to ENT

* Prescribed another round of HP7 antibiotics to see if symptoms subsided. Bad breath completely disappeared but taste persisted
* Once completed, bad breath returned within a few days 

31st Jan 25

* Iron infusion done as a result of a blood test done which showed low iron, I have had low iron for years and have had previous infusions
* No symptom improvement following infusion

3rd Feb 25

* Saw ENT who inspected my throat and nose with camera, nothing abnormal in sinuses, throat, voice box etc
* He asked for another pylori test – negative
* Put me on a PPI for a month, no improvement 
* Referred to get a brain MRI, nothing found, had second MRI with gad injection, nothing found
* Spoke with ENT following MRIs. He told me to go back to my doctor as there isn’t anything further for him to do. He suggested removal of tonsils to see if that improves symptoms, I said no because my tonsils are not inflamed and would rather try everything else before resorting to this.

4th March 25

* Went back to doctor, referred to oral specialist and neurologist. Neuro was referred because she said my symptoms might just be in my head, I don’t believe this

Because the mouth taste began between antibiotics in March and seeing doctor in June, the only things that occurred between that was getting a filling and having covid. I understand this may just be symptoms of long covid, but would like to exhaust all other possibilities before accepting this.

 23rd March 25

* Went to dentist and asked for filling to be removed. I suspected possible allergy to composite might have been causing my symptoms (I have known allergies to latex glue and various adhesives)
* Dentist agreed that it is possible and agreed to remove filling.
* She also referred me to get a OPG xray on my wisdom tooth. I only have 1 in the bottom left and it has partially erupted. Should not come out any further due to being partially behind the bone. Dentist wanted to see if there was possible signs of infection in that tooth that could be causing my symptoms, xray showed no indication of this
* Dentist said that there isn't anything else in my mouth that could be causing the symptoms, I have really good dental hygiene
* She thinks possible burning mouth syndrome
* No improvement since filling removal
* OPG xray came back normal, no signs of infection

25th March 25

* Saw oral specialist
* Explained the whole timeline as above, was crying during this because these problems are ruining my life, I don’t think this helped with  how the specialist perceived me
* He first stated that I need to start meditation to help with my mental health...
* In my notes on the patient form, I included that I have a history of iron deficiency and was once B12 deficient. He immediately said “well that explains your symptoms”. I said no, my levels are fine at the moment and even when my iron was at its lowest, these were never symptoms I had.
* He examined my mouth, I had 2 mouth ulcers at the time. He said the ulcers are causing my symptoms. I said no, I have had ulcers on and off since I was a child, the only symptom that they cause is pain. These are the first ulcers I have had since these problems began so it is not the cause
* I asked if any testing can be done, he said maybe, but does not want to just send me for more tests because he thinks that will contribute to my poor mental health. I said I do not mind getting tests done because that way we can rule things out and put my mind at ease, he still refused to send me for tests
* He said I need to see a psychologist because there is likely no explanation for my symptoms and I need to work on my mental health and learn to live with them. I was not happy with this, my mental health is bad because of these issues, I refuse to believe there is no explanation for them, at least not until we have exhausted all options.
* He said I didn’t have bad breath, which I will admit was not bad when I saw him unfortunately. He says everyone gets bad breath sometimes and I said yes, I've had bad breath in my life, like when I wake up or when I'm dehydrated, but this is different
* He prescribed 400mg alpha lipoic acid daily for 2 weeks then increase to twice daily for 6 weeks. Advised I start taking zinc supplements
* I have taken the ALA as prescribed and also started taking zinc but it is not helping

I am at a loss over this and it is quite literally ruining my life. I do not like going out with friends because I don’t want to be in close proximity to others in case they can smell my breath. I expressed this to my doctor, she said I should not let this prevent me from being social, but I can’t. Even if I do go out, I am so nervous and self-conscious the whole time, so it is easier to stay home. I also have had to stop dating because of this, for the same reason, I cannot go near someone with breath like this and because what if my mouth taste is not just a self-perception thing and they could taste it too? I struggle to focus on work or study because my mind constantly focuses on the taste. It is so isolating and I just need some kind of diagnosis and relief

If you could design a drip coffee bag for a wedding or a special event, what kind of theme would you choose?

My doctor and dentist don't know what's wrong, I have been referred to specialists and still don't have an explanation. I am at my wits end with this, it is ruining my life and I'm really struggling to cope with not having a diagnosis. The timeline is long and a bit convoluted so there is a tldr, additional notes and then a full timeline broken down by dates at the end. Any advice, recommendations on what tests to ask for and/or other specialists to see is very much appreciated. I am desperate to resolve this



TL:DR: Developed a lump sensation in the throat and extremely bad breath, strong enough to smell when speaking. Tested positive for H. pylori and completed antibiotic treatment, but symptoms persisted. Contracted COVID, then a filling was placed in my tooth. Taste issues began after these events. Second round of antibiotics temporarily cleared the bad breath, but taste symptoms remained the whole time. Bad breath returned shortly after stopping treatment leading me to suspect these are two different problems? Possible gut health issues?

Multiple tests including gastroscopy, ENT camera exam, MRIs, and repeated H. pylori tests were all normal. Filling was eventually removed due to suspected allergy, but no improvement. Oral hygiene is excellent, no signs of dental infection or visible issues in mouth.

Referred to an oral specialist who downplayed symptoms, attributed them to mental health, and prescribed alpha lipoic acid and zinc, which have not helped.



**Other things to note:**

* I am 164cm weighing 68kgs, I am caucasian, born in South Africa, lived in Aus for 22 years
* Eating sugar causes mouth taste to become much worse
* I have had scalloping on the sides of my tongue since the taste started
* Taste is not there when I am eating. I have no distortion to taste for any foods (salty, sweet etc)
* I do not take regular medication other than iron and b12 supplements which I have taken for years
* Doctors have recommended mints and mouthwash to help. All it does is make my mouth minty on top of the weird taste, provides no relief
* I have tried removing things from my diet over the last year in case it’s an allergy. Over different periods, I have cut out coffee, sugar, soft drinks, spicy foods, greasy foods, oats, nuts; all to no avail
* I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs
* I have a tongue piercing that is 9 years old, doctor suspected this was the cause, removed for 2 months and no improvements so that is not the cause
* I am wondering if these problems are caused by my gut health. Maybe the antibiotics wrecked my gut and it has not recovered? 
   * I consistently take probiotics, currently taking Henry blooms SB and bioglan 30 billion. Have changed brands/types since this began and nothing helps, have stopped taking for a while which also didn't improve symptoms
   * I eat yoghurt, I drink water kefir 
* Haven’t seen a neurologist yet, I do not believe this is all in my head
* I have hernia mesh in my stomach since March 2023, no complications
* I exercise 3-5 times a week

**Following tests have been done and have all come back within normal ranges:**

* Electrolytes
* B12
* Copper
* Zinc (just above lowest acceptable interval)
* Thyroid
* Liver function
* Kidney function
* Glucose
* Lipase
* Folic acid
* Complete blood count
* Cortisol

I've known her little brother (25M) just as long. I have never been particularly close to her brother, but we all went to the same school and our moms have since become close friends too. During college, I hung out with him one-on-one more as my friend went to school out of state and our parents would get together for dinner parties. Often times we would play card games, watch a movie, or just hang out. At the time I never had any interest in him beyond friendship. When his sister moved back home I didn't hang out with him one on one anymore. Occasionally he'd go to coffee with us or I'd see him when over to their house, but he never hung around with us or our friend group. 

Recently I received a really great job offer, but I didn't want to leave my current position with no replacement as it's a bit of a niche roll. At first I asked my friend if she would be interested in applying to my job, but it was not in her degree field and she was uninterested. I knew her brother was struggling to find a job after university, so I forwarded him the position. When he said he was interested I heavily recommended him to my supervisor, as he has a somewhat similar education background. He got the job, and the last two weeks I have been training him to take over my position. During the day of his interview my coworkers pointed out he is my 'type'. After they mentioned this, I realized they were right. Physically he is very much my type. Additionally, during the time spent training him I realized I had forgotten what a good rapport we have together. We have very similar senses of humor and interests.

 However, I'm uncertain if I should ask him out for 2 reasons. 

1.) I don't think my friend would be cool with it, as she's very protective of her little brother. I also don't want to go behind her back. I'm debating on having a 3rd friend float the idea of us dating to get an idea of her reaction. If she reacts poorly I can drop the idea entirely. 

2.) Both our families have had a horrible 2025. There was a revelation involving their dad and now their parents are going through a messy divorce. I know a lot of the personal details from his sister, and know both sibling have been struggling. My friend has told me she no longer sees herself ever getting married, let alone dating anytime in the near future. I don't know if her brother feels the same way. Not to mention, I can't help but worry he may take after his father and grandfather in the infidelity department. He and his dad were extremely close prior to this mess, but I wouldn't say they have similar personalities. My friend has made comments before the divorce about infidelity not being a 'deal breaker'. Granted, this comment was made when we were in high school, and I suspect it was in reference to her grandparents situation, not her parents.

Any ideas on how to navigate this situation? Should I ask my friend point blank her opinion, or should I have a 3rd party ask her incase she reacts negatively to the idea? Should I drop the idea completely  until their family's current situation improves? Should I just skip all the 'what if's' and speak to him first? ",1,1745747001.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

In autumn and winter 2024, me and a coworker start talking more at work (we always had good communication), mainly about personal matters like our divorces. I show early care by sending her flowers with a thoughtful note: ""remember to take care of yourself.""

In February/March 2025, I invite her for coffee outside of work. She responds positively but cautiously, explaining her busy schedule. Attempts to meet are postponed due to her commitments.

In April, we finally have lunch together at work. The atmosphere feels like a date — with smiles, laughter, and a shy hug at the end. I follow up with a flirty message, and she responds warmly.

Recently, we had lunch again, but Natalia seems more stressed (due to a trip to her home country in war and heavy workload). She reacts hesitantly to further invitations outside of work, but remains kind and respectful. I tell her I enjoy spending time with her, she looks at me with a smile and says she does too.

Before her trip, I gave her a necklace I wore when I was in a horrific car crash some years ago, and I wanted it to protect her too. She returned it again to me, when she came back.

Now, AITA for also going on A FEW (two) dates with other people? I do it, so I don't end up in a black hole over her, if she doesn't reciprocate my feelings, and also to be sure about my feelings. Total honesty, I can't stop stinking about her, but I've been burned before many times, and sadly it's easy for me to end up in a black hole (I'm on antidepressants).",0,1745746740.0,AmItheAsshole,3,0.5,False

Before the Coffee Gets Cold

I brewed it carefully,
measured every ounce of warmth,
stirred in the sweetest hopes,
waited for a hand to reach out.

Minutes slipped into hours,
the steam rising, vanishing,
as I sat watching the silence grow heavy.

Every day,
I made it again —
a little less sugar,
a little more patience,
a little quieter in spirit.

The cup stayed full,
the seat stayed empty,
and the warmth I poured in
faded before the coffee could be tasted.

Now, I hold the cup gently,
feeling the cold seep into my palms,
wondering
if it was ever meant to be sipped.

Maybe some mornings,
we prepare everything right —
but some hands were never meant
to lift the cup.

Before the coffee gets cold,
I’ll learn to drink it myself.

This would be an absolute lifesaver. Also if anyone knows of anything maybe similar as well, do lmk 🙏🏻🙏🏻",1,1745746260.0,Doesthisexist,0,1.0,False
1k9008p,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitPortugalGuide/comments/1k9008p/algarve/,Algarve,"I received several requests to make this post, so here it is!

I know that many travelers feel a bit lost when they arrive at Faro Airport – stepping out of arrivals thinking ""Now what?"" 😅
So I put together a short (but complete) guide based on personal experience to help you out. It covers transport options, handy apps, a relaxing first stop, and a few common mistakes to avoid. Hope it helps!

👉 The best ways to get from Faro Airport to the city center:
The airport is only about 7 km from town, so luckily it’s a quick trip.
The cheapest option is the local bus (Proximo Line 16): it costs just around €2.60 (cash only) and takes about 20 minutes to reach Faro’s central bus station.
If you arrive in the evening or want a faster ride, taxis are waiting outside – about €15 to the city center. Uber and Bolt also work very well in the Algarve, often costing around €7-10 off-peak.
Tip: If you take the bus, make sure it’s heading to Faro City (Cidade) and not the beach direction (Praia de Faro)!

👉 Apps to download before leaving the terminal:
Definitely install Uber and Bolt before arrival.
Also download Google Maps (or Moovit) to navigate public transport easily.
Faro Airport has free unlimited Wi-Fi, so you can set everything up while still inside.
If you’ll need mobile internet outside, you might want to get a local SIM or eSIM later.

👉 Where to stop first to relax and ease into the Algarve vibe:
After arriving in Faro city, a great first stop is the Marina area or the Old Town.
You’ll find nice cafés and bars by the waterfront where you can enjoy a coffee or a cold drink.
One of my favorite places is Jardim Manuel Bivar, right next to the Marina – perfect for relaxing before diving into sightseeing.
Alternatively, you could head to Praia de Faro (easy with bus 16) if you prefer to feel the sand between your toes right away!

👉 Common mistakes to avoid (especially with taxis):

•	Don’t accept rides from random drivers inside the terminal.

•	Always make sure the taxi meter is on or agree on a price before leaving.

•	Night/weekend rates are about 20% higher – that’s normal.

•	Have small cash (€5 bills or coins) ready – for buses and some taxis.

•	Download and set up travel apps while using the airport Wi-Fi to avoid connection problems outside.",1,1745746049.0,VisitPortugalGuide,0,1.0,False

I dated in Medellin back in 2021-ish and so I know the landscape... and I have a pretty good spider-sense on how to spot someone who's trying to play you. 

So i downloaded bumble again today, and I knew that within the first 5 minutes, I'd land on someone like this. Literally started swiping and the 7th or 8th profile, came to this:

https://i.imgur.com/Rhytxjn.png

Right now off the bat, the ""kiss"" emoji and saying ""no casual sex"" is kind of weird. Not the biggest red-sign I've seen, but ok. 

Usually women would describe themselves in their bio, or write something witty, the fact that she wrote this comes off as playing reverse-psychology, like she's a ""serious"" girl, not into sex, wink wink. 

But this is just speculating at this point, it's not the biggest red flag, not even close. 

Her photos are normal, one photo in Bikini but overall, all ""looks normal"". Usually women who are trying to scam will have photos in very suggestive manner.

Anyways, at this point, I match with her...my spider sense tingling though for some reason.

We talk back and forth and after a while, I ask her if she's free for a coffee today. 

https://i.imgur.com/Kh7zs9m.png

Her response? 

""I don't have money because I haven't been paid yet, so I can't come.""


**HUGE RED FLAG** right there! She was basically testing to see if I'd offer to pay, which I did just to see where this would go. A ""normal"" girl would be embarrassed to say that, especially to a stranger who she just met on an dating app. She could have literally come up with any excuse to delay until she got paid to go out. 

**Then comes the sketchy questions** - where do I live and am I with friends? That's basically her checking if we'd be alone in my apartment later. Super weird to ask that so quickly.

So we decide to go for a coffee. **Another red flag** - She's ready to go out with me just after a couple of hours of talking, on the same day we matched! 

I ask her for instagram. She already had an instagram in her bio but i ask her anyways. 

She gives it to me...we add each other:

https://i.imgur.com/sEvbSBU.png


And that's where the **next biggest red flag** is. Her profile was created literally 6 weeks ago. It's full of her selfies. There's no photo with her family or her friends. It's just self-shots of herself. And then, i go through her followers/following and it's all random men. Some gringos, some local, but 95% of them are random men.

This is **another big, red sign**. This is a fake profile 100%, setup to lure men in. All her followers are people she met on Bumble or Tinder. 

At this point, I am 99% sure this is girl is up to no good. 


But she keeps messaging about meeting up. So I ask to call her quickly before meeting. When we talk, I can immediately tell she's Venezuelan with that distinctive Caracas accent. Nothing wrong with being Venezuelan at all, but she had specifically told me she was Paisa (born/raised in Medellin/Antioquia). She probably thought ""this gringo won't know the difference"" lol.


Then she casually mentions her friend works near our meeting spot. Didn't say the friend would join us, but I've seen this movie before - guaranteed there'd be a ""surprise"" text from the friend wanting to join us once we met because she just happens to have finished her shift.


At this point I'm done. **Too many red flags**. I just ghosted.


**With that being said....**


There ARE awesome women in Medellin/Colombia worth dating, but real talk? You probably won't find them on dating apps. And they definitely won't meet you the same day you match.


The real ones will:

- Want to talk for a while before meeting
- Exchange social media and actually have friends/family in their pics
- Meet you in public places first
- Have actual jobs or be studying
- **Be kinda hesitant about dating foreigners (they know many tourists just want sex/drugs)**
- Make you work a bit to earn their trust

You'll find them in

- Running/Workout/gym groups
- Language exchange groups
- Meet up of literally any kind

So go pick up a hobby, and then find groups that do that hobby. Join them. Go there regularly. 

And please put some effort in to get to know the local culture/demographic. So when you go out with someone, you have some idea of their background and can call BS the moment things don't add up. 

**Bottom line**: If it seems too easy, YOU'RE the one being played. You're not the player you think you are.

O’Neill: (yawns, flicks a crumb off his jacket) Yeah, real shiny, Beer Can. My toaster back home boosts my bagels by 100% when I hit “dark.” Call me when you invent coffee that doesn’t taste like motor oil.

Joe: (grins, not looking up) Skippy, you’re overselling again. Last time you “optimized” something, we almost warped into a sun. O’Neill, you ever deal with a know-it-all AI who’s all talk?

O’Neill: (smirks) Carter’s smarter than this glorified paperweight, and she doesn’t need to brag. What’s next, Skippy? Gonna bedazzle the hull to dazzle me?

Skippy: Bedazzle?! I’m an elder AI, not a craft store reject! Fine, watch this: I’ve hacked an enemy Kristang database in 0.004 seconds, snagged their battle plans, and composed a symphony to celebrate. Wanna hear it, Joe? It’s called “Ode to My Awesomeness”!

Joe: (rolls eyes) Pass, Skippy. Your last “symphony” sounded like a cat fight in a blender. O’Neill, tell me you’ve got a trick to shut this guy up.

O’Neill: (leans forward, deadpan) Here’s a trick: answer me this, Shiny. If you’re so awesome, why’s Joe here still fixing your screw-ups? Gimme one good reason I shouldn’t trade you for a Game Boy.

Joe: (shrugs) You did alright, Skippy, but I’m the one who had to mop up the mess when you “heroically” crashed our comms. O’Neill, you ever miss the days when tech didn’t talk back?

O’Neill: (grins) Every damn day, Bishop. Alright, Skippy, one shot: impress me. Do something useful, like… I dunno, make this ship invisible. No whining, just do it.

Skippy: Invisible?! That’s child’s play for a genius like me! Gimme 2.3 seconds to—uh, wait, recalibrating cloaking matrix… okay, fine, it’s glitchy, but I swear I can make the lights dim real spooky-like! Impressed NOW, Colonel Neanderthal?

O’Neill: (chuckles) Spooky lights? I’m terrified. Stick to singing, Sparkles—you’re better at annoying us than impressing. Joe, you got any beer on this rust bucket?

Joe: (laughs) Not yet, but if Skippy keeps this up, I’m brewing some just to survive his ego. Skippy, dial it back before O’Neill Zats you.

O’Neill: (shrugs) Monkeys get the job done. Chill, Beer Can, or I’ll duct-tape you to a Goa’uld mothership.

Skippy: Duct tape?! You barbarian! I’m a billion-year-old AI, not your garage project! Fine, impress me—name one thing you’re better at than me.

O’Neill: (pretends to press button) Oops, was that the “make Skippy chill” button? Nah, guess not. Tell ya what—beat me at poker, and I’ll stop messing with your toys.

Skippy: Poker? That primitive card game? I’d calculate every probability and bluff you into next week, O’Neill. But why bother? You’d probably eat the cards thinking they’re jerky.

O’Neill: (grins) Jerky’s more useful than you right now. C’mon, one hand. Loser shuts up for an hour. Deal?

Skippy: An HOUR of silence from you? Tempting, but I’d rather reprogram your brain to stop asking dumb questions. Oh, wait, there’s nothing to work with up there! Fine, poker it is—prepare to cry, monkey boy.

Scene: The poker game’s on, O’Neill’s slouched at a makeshift table in the ExForce ship, cards in hand, grinning like he’s already won. Skippy’s hologram projects a smug smirk, cards “floating” in his interface.

O’Neill: (tosses a chip) Alright, Shiny, Texas Hold’em, no fancy AI tricks. You bluff worse than a Goa’uld tryin’ to sell me a timeshare. Call or fold, Beer Can.

Skippy: Tricks? I don’t need tricks to crush you, Colonel Simian! I’ve modeled every poker scenario since Mesopotamia. Your face is screaming “pair of twos,” and I’m raising you to embarrassment town. Call THAT!

O’Neill: (leans forward, squints) Pair of twos, huh? You’re readin’ my face like a kid’s book, but you forgot one thing—I’m Jack O’Neill, and I don’t play fair. (slips a card under the table, winks) Check.

Skippy: CHEATING?! You filthy monkey, that’s low even for you! My sensors caught that sleight-of-hand nonsense—your dexterity’s worse than a drunk hamster! I’m calling, and I’m gonna wipe that smirk off your primate mug. Show your cards!

O’Neill: (flips cards, reveals a full house) Whoops, looks like Lady Luck likes me more than your binary brain. Full house, Sparkles. What’s your supercomputer got?

Skippy: (hologram flickers, “cards” show a flush) IMPOSSIBLE! My calculations were flawless! You rigged the deck, you… you CARD-SHARKING TROGLODYTE! I demand a rematch, or I’m locking you in the brig with nothing but my karaoke playlist!

O’Neill: (chuckles, scoops chips) Karaoke? That’s crueler than a Replicator invasion. Take the L, Skippy, and maybe I’ll teach you how to lose with style. Another round?

Skippy: Style?! You have the style of a thrift-store mannequin! Fine, deal again, but I’m watching your every move, O’Neill. One more trick, and I’m venting you into space—accidentally, of course. That you know of.

1k8zqnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k8zqnk/conscious_chapter_10_incursion/,[Conscious] Chapter 10: Incursion,"As dawn crept into the city at 06:00 AM, Daniel, Cathy, and Frank moved like shadows within the trash disposal area adjacent to the fortified high-level class sector of the city. Their hearts pounded with anticipation and fear. Frank kept his eyes glued to his portable computer screen, watching the video feed from the disposal cameras. With a quick signal, he motioned for them to move as one of the garbage trucks obscured the infrared sensors by the main entrance.

They slipped through, ducking close to the truck’s massive wheels as it lumbered forward, utterly indifferent to their presence. The trucks were only programmed to detect obstacles, and as long as the group stayed clear of its path, they were safe.

Upon entering the expansive trash disposal area, they followed Frank's instructions, moving stealthily to avoid the sweeping gaze of the cameras. They exploited the dead angles provided by the numerous crates scattered throughout the area, ultimately reaching the locker room undetected.

The sterile silence of the locker room felt eerie, a stark contrast to the buzzing tension among the three. Dust coated every surface, and the dull lights barely illuminated the old lockers, untouched relics of a time long gone. The team rummaged through them, finding uniforms covered in faded logos and patches—a distant reminder of the era before The New Order had crushed all sense of individuality.

""These’ll have to do,"" Cathy whispered, slipping into one of the old uniforms. The clothes were worn and oversized, but they were identical to the ones the cleaning robots wore—robots designed to resemble humans as a twisted comfort for the high-class.

""They want everything to look controlled by humans,"" Daniel murmured, a bitter edge in his voice. ""They like to pretend they still hold power over us, even in their machines.""

With a nod, they all dressed in the faded uniforms, adjusting their collars and hats. The plan was simple in theory but dangerously fragile in execution. The clothes would pass at a distance, but close inspection would give them away in an instant. They had to stick to the shadows, avoid any wandering eyes, and hope that their timing remained flawless.

\---

The group advanced through the high-class city’s commercial district, moving in perfect unison, their footsteps muffled by the sleek, polished floors. The corridor lights were dim, casting a soft glow over the white, minimalistic architecture—a stark contrast to the chaotic and loud environment they were used to in the lower-class districts. Here, the city seemed like a silent, pristine machine, carefully managed and untouched by the noise of ordinary life. For eight uninterrupted hours each night, this part of the city slept, sheltered from any hint of disturbance.

Humanoid cleaning robots glided along the floors, their reflective surfaces catching brief glints of light as they worked. These machines moved with an indifference to their surroundings, oblivious to Daniel, Cathy, and Frank as they maneuvered past. The trio kept their movements subtle and purposeful, fully aware that one wrong step could alert the system. Usually, the cleaning operators were mostly indifferent to any minor irregularities that might be occurring, while their Loyalist supervisors were notorious for sleeping during their night shifts, neglecting their duty to oversee the employees' work. However, they didn't want to test their luck with any unnecessary movement that might attract unwanted attention.

As they approached the residential area, they found themselves facing their first significant challenge: a heavily secured access point, where security measures grew exponentially tighter. Here, no longer was the high-class city just a place of privilege; it was fortified, meticulously designed to protect its inhabitants. Years of strategic media messaging had sown a constant paranoia in the high-class population, making them demand impenetrable barriers around their homes, convinced of imminent threat.

With no way to bypass the security checkpoint undetected, they resolved to take a substantial risk. Frank would employ his personal computing device to access any information that might aid them in overcoming the security barrier. Though he could disguise his query amidst other processes, the risk of detection by the system remained significant. Frank proceeded cautiously, routing his requests through various nodes within the network to avoid triggering a recognizable pattern that could be flagged as unauthorized access. Eventually, he uncovered data on the two security robot operators responsible for the current checkpoint. At that juncture, gathering data was their sole recourse; any active interference would have been instantly detected by the system.

Regarding the data on the remote operators controlling the security robots, one of the guards, named James, lived alone and appeared to have a moderate case of ludopathy, with an addiction to a VR world specialized in gambling. The other guard, named Larry, was married with two children. Larry was struggling economically due to one of his children undergoing cancer treatment. The expenses were so exorbitant that Larry had been forced to secure a loan from a local criminal organization to make ends meet. He was now working numerous double shifts in an attempt to keep up with the payments, but he knew he needed another solution.

Daniel saw an opportunity in the information they had gathered. He asked Frank and Cathy to remain in position while he attempted to leverage the situation to their advantage. With one guard potentially vulnerable due to his gambling addiction and the other desperate for financial relief, Daniel formulated a plan.

Daniel approached the checkpoint, maintaining a steady, controlled pace, his face partially hidden under his cap. James and Larry, the guards on duty, observed him with mild curiosity, not alarmed, but suspicious; it was rare for a robot to cross on foot rather than being transported by truck.

Just as the guards' suspicion was about to escalate into high alert upon fully recognizing that the robot was, in fact, a human, Daniel acted swiftly. With a voice both calm and commanding, he said, ""James, Larry. I know your names.""

The two guards froze, their expressions shifting from curiosity to shock and fear. The weight of hearing their real names spoken aloud in a place where such information was closely guarded left them visibly shaken. They both knew the severe consequences for any unauthorized person gaining knowledge of their identities.

Seeing their reaction, Daniel pressed on, his tone firm but not threatening, ""I’m one of you — a Minion. I’m not here to expose you, and I don’t want any trouble. I need you to stay calm.""

The fear in their eyes lessened, replaced by tense uncertainty.

""I need your help. My friends and I need to get past this checkpoint,"" Daniel continued. Before either of them could protest, he added quickly, ""And in return, I can make it worth your while. Enough to forget all your problems in the real world.""

After a few tense seconds, Larry was the first to speak, his voice tinged with both curiosity and caution. ""How do you plan to do that?""

Daniel replied calmly, ""We can hack the VR Gambling world so that you win the next game.""

He watched as James’s eyes widened for a moment, reflecting a glimmer of hope mixed with suspicion. ""If you could do that,"" James replied skeptically, ""you would’ve already done it.""

Daniel pressed on, choosing his words carefully. ""Our system could work, but using it would put a target on our backs. Directing prize money to ourselves would only make it easier for the system to track us down.""

Larry seemed to process this, still clearly hesitant but unable to ignore the possibility. ""Why risk it now, though? And wouldn’t the system tag us as cheaters too?""

Daniel leaned in, lowering his voice slightly. ""We are on a one-way mission; we are not coming back. You need not worry about being implicated. The hacking will be perceived as an unusual system glitch—something to investigate only if a connection between the prize and the anomaly's origin is suspected. They will search for links back to us, not you. Ultimately, they will dismiss it as a random anomaly and address the issue. Your prize will remain untouched.""

""How do we know this isn’t a scam?"" James’s voice held a rough edge of suspicion, but his eyes betrayed him, gleaming with the unmistakable pull of temptation. He was hooked, teetering on the edge, yet still grasping for a shred of caution.

""Have you ever seen a real Minion in this part of the city?"" Daniel’s voice was low, coaxing, yet firm. ""We know the risk we’re taking just by standing here. This is it—a once-in-a-lifetime offer, one you’ll never see again.""

A heavy silence settled over them, each man staring at the other, assessing, weighing unspoken truths. Then, after a tense pause, James and Larry turned away to speak in hushed tones. Daniel observed them carefully, his senses attuned to their intentions. Though their words were quiet, their energy radiated a shared resolution. They were in—but they needed to cement the pact between them, a silent promise. For James, this deal meant finally seizing something he’d chased for years, a prize always just out of reach for his gambling soul. For Larry, it was a lifeline, a means to save his family from the grinding desperation that shadowed them.

When they returned, their expressions were firm. They were ready. Daniel nodded, signaling Frank and Cathy to step forward. He leaned toward Frank, his voice just above a whisper. ""Time for that hack you found in the Gambling VR network. Make the prize look real. James is betting everything.""

Frank’s fingers danced across the controls, deftly setting up the instant lottery win with precision only he could deliver. Daniel felt the weight of the moment settle in; he knew James’s promise was genuine. Larry would receive his share, enough to pull his son and family from the brink.

Then, with a simple press, James placed the bet. The digital numbers flashed across the display, and, just like that, the grand prize hit. The light in James’s eyes was blinding—unfiltered shock and elation, a lifetime of losses finally redeemed. Larry, standing beside him, looked equally stunned, his mouth hanging open, the weight of his future lifting.

With their winnings secure, they allowed Daniel, Frank, and Cathy to pass through the checkpoint, their debt silently acknowledged. But just as they were about to cross to safety, a voice called out.

""Wait!"" It was Larry.

""Guys, I don’t know where you’re headed, but you have no idea what this money means to me."" Larry’s voice trembled slightly, a mix of gratitude and newfound hope. He took a breath and added, ""With those clothes, though, you won’t get far. We have some uniforms for our security bots. They should help you blend in, at least enough to make it through the next few blocks. It’s the least I can do. I feel like… you’re good people.""

Daniel, Cathy, and Frank exchanged a glance, momentarily stunned by the unexpected generosity. The relief was palpable. They turned to Larry, each thanking him with a sincerity that needed no words. This was more than just a gesture—it was a lifeline.

They entered the dimly lit security checkpoint room, where rows of mechanical equipment and spare bot parts lined the walls. The security uniforms hung stiffly in a corner, emitting a faint, metallic scent. They suited up quickly, feeling the weight of the protective gear, each piece fitting over them like armor.

As they left, they resisted the urge to look back or give another farewell. Every extra word, every lingering glance could tip the scales against them. They had slipped past the second big hurdle, and Daniel knew that even the smallest misstep now could shatter everything they’d built.

The remote security operators could have sounded the alarm at any point, reporting the breach in real time. Yet somehow, Daniel had worked a quiet magic, bending the system just enough to let them pass undetected. To Cathy and Frank, it felt like they had just witnessed a miracle.

\---

Thanks to the security uniforms, Daniel, Cathy, and Frank slipped through the residential neighborhood undetected. The clock struck 7:00 a.m. as they entered the district—a cluster of polished, pristine homes belonging to The Professionals, the elite class of society. Here, all was hushed; the occupants enjoyed a deep, undisturbed sleep, unaware of any intrusion. The silence was almost surreal, broken only by the occasional thud of dumpsters closing as silent, unfeeling cleaning bots completed their rounds, whisking away any stray remnants of last night’s waste.

Moving quickly, they passed through the sleeping neighborhood just as the first lights began to flicker on in scattered houses. People were stirring, ready to begin another day. But for now, their attention was focused inward, not on the empty streets where Daniel and his team blended seamlessly into the shadows.

At 8:00 a.m., the mainframe building came into view in the distance, its sleek silhouette standing tall against the early morning light. These mainframes—scattered across key locations worldwide—powered Motherbrain, the AI behemoth responsible of the nightmare they were living. Every instruction, every transaction, every silent command was processed through these immense structures, making them both sacred and untouchable to most.

They were now in the heart of the headquarters area, where The Professionals labored daily, building and refining the code that sustained their society. The offices wouldn’t officially open until 9:00 a.m., but they knew they were far from alone. Although human security presence was light at this hour, service robots were already busy at work, their mechanical hands setting tables, filling coffee machines, and arranging supplies in anticipation of the incoming wave of Professionals.

Daniel, Cathy, and Frank kept their heads down, careful to avoid drawing attention. Operators controlling the service bots were fully immersed in their tasks, and the Loyalists—the overseers who monitored every aspect of life here—hadn’t yet arrived for their shift. No one was watching the security feeds, no one would think to review the footage just yet, but every second counted. They moved with quiet urgency, knowing that this slim window of invisibility wouldn’t last.

\---

By the time Daniel, Cathy, and Frank reached the towering mainframe building, the clock read 8:30 a.m. They moved with quiet precision, attempting to be as inconspicuous as possible. But with every passing second, the pressure mounted. Time was slipping away; they needed to take bolder risks.

""Frank, find us a way in,"" Daniel whispered, his voice tense but controlled. Frank opened his portable terminal, fingers racing over the keyboard. After a moment, he looked up, eyes sharp. ""There’s a maintenance door on the side,"" he said. ""Not on the grid, but it might be our best shot.""

They quickly made their way around the building, finding a stairwell that led down to a heavy, unmarked maintenance door. Frank studied the control panel but realized it was locked tight. Improvising, he triggered a minor alarm from within the maintenance room itself, hoping it would prompt someone to come investigate. They ducked behind a stack of industrial-grade crates, each one stamped with warnings about refrigeration components essential to the mainframe’s operation await for the right window of opportunity to open.

A lone maintenance robot operator arrived, unlocked with a sharp hiss and shuffled into the room, drawn by the alert. Luck was on their side—it wasn’t a security bot but a simple maintenance operator, focused entirely on diagnostics. As the operator’s attention remained on its console, Daniel, Cathy, and Frank slipped inside, gliding past the door without a sound.

Once inside, Frank quickly hacked into the video feed, redirecting the low-priority cameras away from their positions. 9:00 a.m. loomed closer by the second, but they knew patience was critical. They waited, breaths held, as the maintenance operator completed his inspection. Only when he finally turned to leave did they allow themselves to exhale, their nerves taut with anticipation.

\---

They reached the elevator, knowing that this was it—their final leap into the unknown. From this point on, there would be no turning back.

In the dim light of the hallway, Daniel, Cathy, and Frank exchanged one last silent embrace, a wordless promise binding them together. Whatever happened next, they were in this until the very end.

Frank opened his portable terminal, fingers deftly tapping as he took control of the elevator’s internal camera, freezing the video feed with a quick script. He knew the maneuver would trip the system’s alarms in just a few minutes, but it would give them enough time to reach the access floor without immediate detection.

As they stepped into the elevator and the doors slid shut, a heavy silence fell over them. The lift moved at a steady, almost maddeningly slow pace, the calm motion in stark contrast to the urgent panic simmering inside them. Trapped in that small, sterile box, every second felt like an eternity. They could almost hear the walls closing in, the weight of their mission pressing down on them. For a moment, it felt like they were caught—frozen, exposed. Then, with a soft chime, the doors opened, flooding them with a wave of relief.

They stepped out into a vast, cold expanse of machinery and screens. Rows upon rows of high-end server workstations blinked and hummed, each one processing a torrent of data, the very heartbeat of Motherbrain pulsing through every line of code, every wired connection.

But as soon as they moved onto the floor, they triggered a swarm of cameras. They knew the drill—there was no hiding from the all-seeing eyes on this level. Alarms blared to life, flashing red lights casting a stark warning across the vast room. They had seconds, maybe a minute, before an army of security bots descended upon them.

Their final countdown had begun.

\----

They sprinted down the narrow corridors, every footfall echoing like thunder, until they reached what they’d risked everything to find: a direct-access workstation to the mainframe.

Frank wasted no time, plugging his device into the terminal and launching his bypass script, muttering a silent prayer that it would work. The screen flashed as the script hunted for vulnerabilities, combing the system for any exploit that might grant them access. But the process crawled, each line of code ticking forward at a painfully slow pace. They needed time—time they didn’t have.

The first security bot appeared on their floor barely a minute after the alarms sounded. Its sensor lights swept the room, locking onto them in an instant. The bot’s operator quickly assessed the threat, and the cold, unyielding barrel of a gun rose, aimed directly at them.

""Stop! Hands up, now!"" The command echoed through the room, the operator’s voice sharp and unrelenting.

Frank’s script wasn’t finished. They needed a distraction. Without a second thought, Daniel stepped forward, placing himself squarely in the bot’s line of sight, shielding Cathy and Frank with his own body.

""Stop right there! Do not move!"" the operator shouted through the bot’s speakers.

Daniel halted, raising his hands just slightly, his gaze meeting the faceless sensor of the security bot. He sensed something in the operator’s voice—a hesitation, a reluctance. This wasn’t a man eager to pull the trigger; it was a person who didn’t want this situation to end in violence. But duty would override hesitation if the operator noticed Frank at the terminal again.

Daniel took a careful step forward, then another, moving slowly, deliberately, keeping the operator’s focus entirely on himself.

""I SAID STOP!!"" The operator’s voice broke slightly, the strain evident. The bot’s gun wavered just a fraction, betraying the operator’s desperation to avoid bloodshed.

Daniel spoke softly, carefully, searching for the right words. The words that would reach past the machine, into the human behind it, and find some thread of understanding.

""I know you’re a good man,"" he said gently, each word a bridge across the tension.

He sensed a subtle shift in the operator’s energy—a flicker of doubt piercing the fog of his duty-bound focus. Beneath the rigid demands of protocol, Daniel could feel the operator’s hesitation, his reluctance fighting to surface in the midst of chaos.

""You don’t want this to end in bloodshed,"" Daniel continued, his voice barely above a whisper, warm, steady. ""I know you don’t mean any harm.""

He willed the doubt to rise, to distract the operator just long enough for Frank to finish his work. Behind him, Frank’s fingers flew over the keyboard. Daniel could sense he was close, that the final step to disable the AGI subroutine was within reach.

Daniel took a cautious step forward, his movements calculated, pulling the operator’s attention entirely onto himself. ""Please…we had no choice,"" he pleaded, inching closer, his words holding the quiet urgency of truth.

He could feel the conflict within the operator—the tangle of fear, doubt, duty. The man’s focus wavered, and Daniel seized the precious seconds, his heart pounding as he sensed Frank nearing the final command.

""STOP MOVING NOW!!!"" The operator’s voice cracked with strain, the security bot’s weapon quivering as it stayed trained on him.

But then the operator’s gaze shifted past Daniel. His eyes found Frank at the keyboard. Instantly, the operator’s energy changed, hardening into something sharp, cold. Rage. Betrayal. Duty crystallized in an instant.

Daniel felt the shift before it even registered in the bot’s movement. The gun swung away from him, lining up to target Frank. There was no more time. Daniel surged forward, throwing himself against the bot with all his strength. The shot fired, veering off just enough to miss Frank, but the operator retaliated instantly, shoving Daniel aside with brutal force. Pain shot through his arm as he crashed to the ground, a sickening snap telling him it was broken.

But it was done. In that single desperate second, Frank executed the final command. The AGI subroutine flickered out, and with it, the relentless, calculating reach of Motherbrain.

Frank turned, giving Daniel a thumbs-up, his face lit with relief. But just as the wave of victory swept over them, a message appeared on the workstation screen:

""Congratulations! You have completed the final task assignment.""

**Author's Note:** 

I'm excited to share the first short story I wrote last year. It's *a sci-fi thriller about an AI evolving to gain consciousness*. While it's a bit rough around the edges, I had a blast writing it.

As a solo game developer, I've created a tool to produce audiobooks. Since I don't have a marketing budget, I'm offering my services for free. If you're interested in having an audiobook version of your story or need a translation into Spanish, feel free to reach out. I'd love to help bring more stories to life through audio and video.

For more information about the project, please visit the following link: [Creating your audiobook for free. ](https://www.aistorybookeditor.com/we-create-the-audiobook-for-your-story/)

Looking forward to collaborating with you!",2,1745744917.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1k8zq39,https://www.reddit.com/r/JujutsuPowerScaling/comments/1k8zq39/yuta_could_solo_gojo_and_sukunagege/,Yuta could solo gojo and sukuna——Gege,"
GGGg Gojo wasn’t just hyping Yuta up when he said, “Yuta will be as good as me.” No, he was warning us all that Yuta is built different, with potential unlike anyone else. And let’s be clear: Gojo’s words are basically Gege’s writing. If Gojo says something, it’s because Gege wants us to know it’s improtant.( Don’t care about kenjaku because more stronger more important their words are)

Now, Gojo didn’t say Yuta would surpass him. He said Yuta could be as good as him. But what Gojo left unsaid is this: if Yuta had Sukuna’s mentality, he wouldn’t just match Gojo—he’d surpass Sukuna. That’s the truth Gege has been hinting at all along.

Let’s break it down:
	Gojo - THE GOD of Jujutsu. The guy everyone looks up to. The man who stood toe-to-toe with Sukuna and almost brought him down.
		Gojo says Yuta has the potential to reach his level, which is already insane. But potential alone isn’t enough to surpass someone like Sukuna.
		Sukuna isn’t just strong because of his cursed energy or techniques—he’s strong because he has the mindset of ruthless, ambitious, and completely unshakable.

And here’s the key: If Yuta haddd Sukuna’s mindset, the kind of drive and hunger for dominance that Sukuna has, he’d blow past Sukuna and become the strongest sorcerer to ever exist.

Without Sukuna’s mindset, Yuta will be good.But to truly surpass Sukuna, he’d need to embrace that same brutal ambition. Sukuna’s mentality is what makes him the King of Curses. If Yuta could do that, he’d be unstoppable.

And don’t even get me started on EoS Yuta. The Yuta who has grandkids in the epilogue? THAT Yuta is going to be a freaking monster. With decades of experience, he would unlock a power beyond even Sukuna’s comprehension. And if that Yuta had Sukuna’s mindset? Game over for sukuna and gojo. They  just be another name on the list of people Yuta obliterated.

When that happens, Gojo’s gonna be chilling in the afterlife, sipping his cursed coffee, like, “I told you all this day would come.”

Sukuna and Gojo , pack it up. If Yuta had your mindset, you wouldn’t stand a chance.

Gege already wrote this story ,we’re just watching it unfold so please don’t compare with kenjaku and kashimo . It’s an insult for him

**Commuting stats:**

* **Total commuting days: 205 (took public transit on extreme weather days)**
* **Total commuting miles: 3,075**
* **Average speed: 18.2 mph**
* **Average commute time: 25 mins (was 30-45 mins by car with traffic)**
* **Longest streak without using a car: 43 days**

**Financial breakdown:**

* **Gas savings: $615 (based on my old 24 MPG sedan)**
* **Avoided car maintenance: $240 (oil changes, reduced wear and tear)**
* **Parking savings: 480(480(40/month at work)**
* **Reduced car insurance: $85 (low-mileage discount)**
* **Ebike electricity cost: \~$8 for the entire year**
* **Ebike maintenance: $260 (new tires, brake adjustment, tune-up)**
* **Net financial benefit: \~$1,152**

**Unexpected benefits I never considered:**

* **Lost 18 pounds without changing my diet**
* **Consistent arrival times (no more ""traffic excuse"" for being late)**
* **Morning rides replaced my coffee habit**
* **Evening rides completely reset my mind after stressful workdays**
* **Found 3 excellent local restaurants I had never noticed while driving**
* **My car now lasts weeks between fill-ups**

**My setup evolved over time:**

* **Started with minimal gear, gradually optimized**
* **Now have dedicated bags that stay packed**
* **Keep a change of clothes at work**
* **Found that fenders were the most important accessory**
* **Spare folding lock stays at the office**

**What I wish I knew from the start:**

* **How to layer properly for different temperatures**
* **The importance of keeping a basic repair kit**
* **That panniers are infinitely better than a backpack**
* **That using pedal assist efficiently takes practice**

I'm kind, but also very honest, direct and straightforward. Tough half the time, sensitive the other half of the time - it's not a contradiction.  I tend to put people at ease and have been told that I have a calming presence. I'm reasonably attractive, but don't try to compete with others on that account. I'm short (5'1), athletic build, blondish/brownish wavy hair, green eyes.


I'm looking for a deeper connection that builds over time - not a one-time thing or a casual fling. Having said that, I don't put labels and don't need them either.


Send me a message and tell me about you - the more the better, especially on a deeper level, and include a pic (imgur link works). I'll send one back if you ask.


I wish you the best on your journey - it's not easy to find and make connections.",0,1745743788.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.5,False

# Pho vs.Grill (2025): Which Reigns Supreme? [Restaurant Review & Face-Off]

The aroma of fragrant herbs, the savory steam rising from a bowl of broth, and the sizzle of perfectly grilled meats – Vietnamese cuisine tantalizes the senses and offers a diverse palette of flavors. At the heart of this cuisine lies a delicious rivalry: Pho, the iconic Vietnamese noodle soup, and a diverse array of grilled dishes.Forget your typical burger joint brawl; this is a showdown between two culinary titans: Pho vs. Grill. which one truly reigns supreme in the hearts (and stomachs) of diners in 2025? Whether you’re a local diner seeking authentic vietnamese food, a tourist exploring new culinary landscapes, a seasoned pho enthusiast, or a family searching for a satisfying meal, this in-depth review and face-off is for you.

## Understanding the Appeal: Pho and Grill Defined

Before we dive into the heart of the competition, let's define our contenders.

**Pho:** More than just a soup, pho is a culinary experience.It's characterized by its long-simmered broth, typically beef or chicken, flavored with aromatic spices like star anise, cinnamon, and cloves. The broth is then ladled over rice noodles and topped with your choice of meat (beef pho being the most classic), along with fresh herbs like cilantro, basil, and bean sprouts. A squeeze of lime and a dash of chili sauce, sriracha, or hoisin sauce completes the symphony of flavors.Variations abound, from rare beef pho to well done beef pho, chicken pho, gluten free pho, and even vegan pho options. The versatility of pho allows for a truly personalized dining experience.

**grill:** ""Grill"" encompasses a wide selection of dishes featuring marinated meats grilled to perfection. This includes classics like bbq pork,lemongrass chicken,grilled shrimp,and even more creative options like grilled meat pho (where grilled meats are added as a topping). Grilled pork vermicelli is another popular dish, featuring grilled pork served over a bed of vermicelli noodles with fresh vegetables and a flavorful Vietnamese dipping sauce. The appeal here lies in the smoky, savory flavor imparted by the grilling process, creating a satisfying contrast to the fresh herbs and vegetables typically served alongside. Many who search for Vietnamese food delivery or take away frequently enough look at grilled options as an add on or shareable plate.

## Round 1: Authenticity and Tradition

For many, the authenticity of Vietnamese cuisine is paramount. does the restaurant stay true to conventional recipes and techniques? Does it source high-quality ingredients?

**Pho:** The key to remarkable pho lies in the broth. A truly authentic pho broth takes hours, if not days, to prepare, simmering bones and spices to extract maximum flavor. Look for restaurants that boast about their broth-making process. The quality of the rice noodles also matters; they should be tender yet firm, not mushy. Finding the best pho broth in your city requires some dedicated searching and, of course, tasting!

**Grill:** Authenticity in grilling comes down to the marinades and the technique.Traditional Vietnamese marinades often incorporate fish sauce, lemongrass, garlic, and other aromatic ingredients. The grilling process should result in perfectly cooked meat – juicy and flavorful, with a slightly charred exterior.

**The Takeaway:** Both pho and grill dishes can be incredibly authentic, depending on the restaurant. Look for establishments that emphasize fresh ingredients and traditional preparation methods. Consider reading restaurant reviews specifically mentioning the authenticity of the food. Many local restaurants pride themselves on maintaining the same recipes for years.

## Round 2: flavor and Variety

Flavor is subjective, but variety is objectively measurable. Which culinary avenue offers more diverse options to cater to different palates?

**Pho:** While beef pho remains a classic, the world of pho is expanding. Chicken pho offers a lighter choice,while vegetarian pho caters to plant-based diners. Different cuts of beef,such as rare beef,well-done beef,and brisket,add further variation. And, don't forget about the pho toppings – bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, lime, and chili sauce – allowing for further customization. Spicy pho is also a growing trend,catering to those who enjoy a fiery kick.

**Grill:** Grilled dishes offer a wider range of proteins, from pork and chicken to shrimp and beef. Different marinades can create a diverse flavor profile, from sweet and savory to spicy and tangy. The accompanying dipping sauces, such as fish sauce-based sauces or peanut sauces, further enhance the flavor experience. Many restaurants offer grilled skewers, allowing diners to sample a variety of meats. Grilled pork vermicelli, with its fresh vegetables and flavorful sauce, provides a welcome contrast to the richness of the grilled meat.

**the Takeaway:** Grill offers a broader range of protein options and flavor profiles,making it possibly more appealing to those seeking variety. However, the customization options within pho allow diners to tailor the dish to their exact preferences. Look at restaurant menus online to gauge variety.

## Round 3: health and Nutrition

In 2025, health-conscious diners are more prevalent than ever. Which of these dishes offers a healthier option?

**Pho:** Pho can be a relatively healthy meal. The broth provides hydration and electrolytes, while the rice noodles offer a source of carbohydrates. The meat provides protein, and the herbs and vegetables offer vitamins and minerals. However, the sodium content of the broth can be high, and some cuts of beef can be fatty.For a healthier option, choose chicken pho or vegetarian pho, and ask for lean cuts of beef. Gluten free pho options are also increasingly available.**Grill:** Grilled meats can be a good source of protein, and the grilling process helps to reduce fat content. However, the marinades can be high in sugar and sodium. The accompanying dipping sauces can also be calorie-dense. For a healthier option, choose lean meats like chicken or shrimp, and ask for the marinade on the side. opt for grilled dishes served with plenty of fresh vegetables. A pho salad, while not a traditional dish, can be a lighter alternative.

**The Takeaway:** Both pho and grilled dishes can be part of a healthy diet, but moderation and mindful choices are key. Pay attention to the sodium and sugar content,and opt for lean proteins and plenty of vegetables.

## Round 4: Price and Accessibility

Affordability and convenience play a meaningful role in dining decisions. Which option offers a better value and is more readily available?

**Pho:** Pho is generally an affordable meal, with prices ranging from relatively inexpensive to moderately priced. pho restaurants are becoming increasingly common, making it relatively easy to find a place serving pho. Pho delivery and pho takeout are also widely available, offering convenient options for busy individuals and families.Many places advertise lunch specials pho and dinner specials pho to further increase affordability.

**Grill:** The price of grilled dishes can vary depending on the type of meat and the restaurant. Grilled dishes are often slightly more expensive than pho. While Vietnamese restaurants offering grilled dishes are common, they may not be as ubiquitous as pho restaurants. Vietnamese food delivery services often include grilling options.

**The Takeaway:** Pho generally offers a more affordable and accessible option. Though, the availability of grilled dishes is increasing, and many Vietnamese restaurants offer both pho and grill options on their menu.

## Round 5: The dining Experience

Beyond the food itself,the overall dining experience matters. Which option offers a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience?

**Pho:** eating pho is often a communal experience, with diners sharing bowls of soup and customizing them to their liking. The aroma of the broth and the vibrant colors of the toppings create a visually appealing experience. The slurp of the noodles and the warmth of the broth provide a comforting and satisfying sensation. The ability to add pho toppings and spices allows each diner to create their perfect bowl.

**Grill:** Grilled dishes are often served on platters, allowing diners to share and sample different meats. The smoky aroma and the sizzling sound of the grill create an exciting and appetizing atmosphere. The variety of textures and flavors provides a stimulating culinary experience.Family meals often centered around grilled selections allow for a diverse sharing experience.

**The Takeaway:** Both options offer a unique and enjoyable dining experience. Pho provides a comforting and communal experience, while grilled dishes offer a more exciting and stimulating experience. Consider the atmosphere and ambiance of the restaurant when making your choice.

## The Verdict: It's a Tie!

Ultimately, the choice between pho and grill comes down to personal preference. There's no clear winner! Both dishes offer unique flavors, textures, and experiences.

**Pho is ideal for:**

   Those seeking a comforting and affordable meal.
   Those who enjoy customizing their food.
   Cooler days or when you crave a warm bowl of soup.
   Those seeking gluten-free or vegan options.

**Grill is ideal for:**

   Those seeking a variety of protein options and flavors.
   Those who enjoy the smoky flavor of grilled meats.
   sharing with friends and family.
   Warmer days or when you crave something savory and satisfying.

   **Spring rolls and summer rolls:** Fresh and flavorful appetizers filled with vermicelli noodles, vegetables, and your choice of protein.
   **Banh mi:** Vietnamese sandwiches filled with grilled meats, pickled vegetables, and flavorful sauces.

*   **Vietnamese coffee:** Strong and flavorful coffee served with condensed milk.

1k8zaom,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1k8zaom/what_is_a_good_detox_tea/,What is a good detox tea?,"I never thought I’d be someone who drinks “detox tea.” It always felt like a marketing term—vague promises, dramatic claims, and teas that usually meant living in the bathroom for half the day.

But after reading up on **Lulutox Detox Tea**, I realized not all detox teas are created equal. People weren’t saying it worked miracles—they were saying it helped with **bloating, digestion, and energy**, and that intrigued me. So if you’re wondering *what is a good detox tea*, I tested **Lulutox tea** every single day for 6 weeks. Here's what happened—no fluff, just facts.

**What makes a detox tea “good,” anyway?**

To me, a good detox tea should:

* Support digestion without being a laxative
* Help reduce bloating
* Improve energy naturally
* Be made with recognizable, high-quality herbs
* Fit into your daily life without causing side effects

That’s what I was hoping for—and surprisingly, that’s what **lulutox detox tea** delivered.

**What’s inside Lulutox Tea?**

Before I even bought it, I checked the **lulutox tea ingredients**. I liked what I saw: 13 superfoods and herbs used for centuries in traditional medicine. Nothing sketchy, no synthetic additives, and no mystery “proprietary blend.”

Here are some of the main ones:

* **Matcha Green Tea & Oolong Tea** – support metabolism and fat burning
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** – provide clean, sustained energy
* **Sencha Green Tea** – antioxidant powerhouse
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** – support liver function and detox
* **Ginseng, Goji Berries, Lemongrass, Nettle Leaf** – help with inflammation, gut health, and immune support
* **Stevia Leaf** – adds natural sweetness with zero calories

Bonus: the tea is **vegan, gluten-free, soy-free**, and has a mild amount of caffeine (18mg per bag). It also comes in pyramid-shaped bags for better steeping.

**My 6-week experience: What changed?**

**Week 1–2:**  
The most immediate benefit? **Way less bloating**. Normally, I get puffy after lunch or dinner—even if I eat light. But after a few days of drinking one cup of Lulutox daily, my stomach looked and felt flatter. I was comfortable in my jeans *all day*, which never happens.

**Week 3–4:**  
I noticed more **stable energy levels**. I wasn’t crashing at 2 PM like usual, and I started needing less coffee. My digestion felt more “regular,” too—nothing extreme, just better overall balance. No discomfort, no urgency, just natural support.

**Week 5–6:**  
By this point, I’d lost around 5 pounds—not from extreme dieting, just walking more and eating mostly whole foods. My cravings were down, and my stomach definitely looked leaner. I felt more in control of my routine. My skin even started looking a bit clearer.

**Did I have any side effects?**

If you’re researching **lulutox tea side effects**, I can honestly say I didn’t have any. No cramps, no headaches, no “cleansing emergencies” that other detox teas are known for. The only thing I noticed was that I needed to drink a bit more water, probably because of the mild diuretic effect.

So in terms of safety: **is lulutox tea safe?** In my experience, yes—but always check with a healthcare provider if you’re unsure or have medical conditions.

**Where to get it (don’t fall for fakes)**

If you’re trying to figure out **lulutox tea where to buy**, I highly recommend sticking with the [**official website here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). I’ve seen sketchy listings on third-party sites that don’t have the real ingredients.

Here’s the [**second link I used**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) if the first one doesn’t work. Both should lead to the same 70% off deal they were running when I ordered.

**Final thoughts: What is a good detox tea?**

After using **Lulutox Detox Tea** every day for a month and a half, I’d say this:  
A good detox tea isn’t about extreme weight loss or crash cleanses. It’s about supporting your body’s natural systems—digestion, energy, and inflammation—gently and consistently.

So **does lulutox detox tea work?** For me, yes. It helped reduce bloating, gave me more natural energy, and helped me stay on track with better habits.

If you’re looking for a **lulutox tea review** that’s real and not written like an ad—this is it. I’d love to hear from others who’ve tried it too. Did you notice similar changes? Any unexpected **lulutox detox tea side effects**? Let’s compare notes.",1,1745743048.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

1k8za3n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8za3n,My experience: Boracay vs El Nido (March and April),"
Boracay
Times Visited: Once (stayed for 7 nights)

Scenery & Sunset:
You can walk from Station 1 to 3!! everything’s in one place! The sunset is different and beautiful every single day. I cried because of how unreal it felt.

Transportation:
What impressed me most was being able to travel from end to end (Puka Beach to the Caticlan ferry) without needing a tricycle.
I used the HOHO (Hop-on Hop-off) via Klook, but you can also book it directly in Boracay.
Tricycles are super cheap too—only around ₱15! Rented a motorcycle and it was fun as well! 

Sunset Party Cruise with a Mini Tour:
Even though I was solo, I joined and felt like an extrovert.
	•	Red Whale: Biggest party boat in Boracay. I got so drunk on their cocktails and had the best time with their pica-pica!
	•	HaqqyLife: (Also available in El Nido!) I met so many people here. I didn’t feel out of place at all—we all became friends! 

Where to Eat:
	•	Poco Deli: First tried this in Coron last year. Still dreaming about their carbonara!! the bacon is heavenly.
	•	Mai Tai: Amazing cocktails! Went during happy hour with a sunset view. Babaero and Sipsip Tinggil are a must-try!
	•	Meze Wrap: Mozzarella wrap was good, but not super crave-worthy.
	•	Gyukatsu: So good I almost cried. Sadder part? No one to share it with. I almost ate here twice in one day!
	•	Hakata Boracay: Perfect if you and your friends crave different things—Japanese + Filipino food! Loved their ramen, karaage, and piña colada!
	•	My Crepes: Crispy crepes—ask for extra crispy!
	•	Frendz: Loved everything I ordered heree!! especially the chicken fajitas and pasta!
	•	Jammers: Great carbonara and Hydra Juice (especially good for hangovers).
	•	Cafe del Sol: Decent coffee and pastries!
	•	Andok’s: Ate sinigang after partying—hit the spot!
	•	Aplaya: Pizza, pasta, and beachfront view. 10/10 vibes.
	•	Jollibee: Because chicken spaghetti is life. No explanation needed.

Massage:
	•	Kabayan Spa (Station 2): Saw it on Facebook ads and decided to try. They  tested the oil on my skin first—loved it! right pressure and i feel so special lol.

Overall:
What I loved most about Boracay is that all your cravings can be satisfied here.
Fast food, variety? it’s complete.
But honestly, the number of options got overwhelming sometimes, and I kept going back to my favorite spots.
I cried during sunset 😶 it was just too beautiful.
Sand is super fine too, especially at Station 1!

⸻

El Nido
Times Visited: 3x different (Nov, January, and March)

Scenery:
First time I visited, I felt like Moana. I didn’t want to leave.
The views are breathtaking.

Sunset:
The best spots are Las Cabanas and Lio.
If you’re feeling lazy, just head to the cemetery area (yes, search it on Google Maps!).

Transportation:
You can ride a tricycle or rent a motorbike depending where you want to go.
Tricycle ride from town to Lio Estate is ₱300 (as of March 2025)~ but could be higher for foreigners.
Other routes, I’m not so sure.

Tour Agency:
Highly recommend El Nido Leatherback! Their boats have a second floor.
Tours A and C are the best. (Haven’t tried B and D yet.)

Where to Eat:
	•	El Nido Grill (Lio): Their grilled liempo BBQ hits the spot after swimming.
	•	Wantusawa (Lio): Also has a Makati branch! Their laksa is so good.
	•	Osaka Castle: Tsukemen is amazing! Loved the karaage and seaweed sides too.
	•	Ap Kala: BEST piña colada I’ve ever had + great chicken wings.
	•	McDo (Vanilla Beach): Burger just hits different when you’re eating it with a beach view.
	•	Unocha: Try the Mango Cloud Party!
	•	Holy Smoke: Holy sh*t it’s good—but too heavy to eat again anytime soon.
	•	Grounded (town): Look for the spot with the big rocks! Great cookies, but expensive coffee (oat-based).
	•	Hama Coffee: Stunning view, decent coffee, loved their breakfast!
	•	Masa Bakehouse: Near the bus/van terminal. Ordered their coco jam coffee twice—it was that good. (They also have a branch in Elyu.) Warning: coffee here made my acid reflux crazy—because it was that good!!

Note: I didn’t include the places I didn’t like.

Tips:
If you have a sensitive stomach, stick to bottled water and avoid ice.
I didn’t get stomach issues, but maybe that’s just because my tummy is now built different after visiting 5 times.

Massage:
	•	A Spa (Lio Estate): ₱1,800 per massage. Easily one of the top 5 massages in my 30 years of existence! They know where to find the pressure points.
	•	Oriental Spa (town): Honestly disappointing—too soft for my liking. Good if you prefer light massage.

I've been on a keto diet for around 1 year. Prior to keto I had insulin resistance and high triglycerides.

When I first started keto within 6 months my Triglycerides went to a normal range and my LDL and HDL increased.

I did another cholesterol test at the 1 year mark and my triglycerides randomly went up - which i was not expecting ?! Weirdly my LDL went down?

My recent results were :

HDL 1.9nmol LDL 3.1 nmol **triglycerides 4.8 nmol ?!?**

I was shocked as in my last blood tests my triglycerides were 1.2nmol and my LDL was 4.3 and HDL 1.7 ?!?

I'm so confused. I eat a very similar diet as I was eating prior. And I don't know what could have spiked my triglycerites so high, all i would have had for brekafast was coffee (with almost no milk), greek unflavoured yogurt and maybe an avo? all extemely low carb foods :( 

I'm aware eating would affect it but it's almost x4 higher - I didn't think eating would affect it this significantly especially since I only ate low carb foods ? 

I was wondering - does this seem normal ? Does anyone know HOW much trigs should increase in a non fasted test compared to fasted ? Anyone had any experience or have info on this. I'm a bit worried and feel quite defeated.

  
If even on a Keto diet and elimenating carbs my body is still producing dangerously high levels of triglycerides than literally, what can I even do at this point.

Every summer, my family battles itchy bites, ruined outdoor dinners, and restless nights. I’ve gone through just about every method available: sprays, candles, repellent patches, and even those expensive ultrasonic devices. Some helped a little, most didn’t. That’s why I finally decided to test a **bug zapper for mosquitoes** more seriously. After seeing a ton of chatter about the **Zappify mosquito zapper**, I figured it was time to see if it lived up to the hype.

Here’s everything you should know if you’re thinking about trying **Zappify 2.0** yourself.

# Why I Chose Zappify Over Other Options

First, I wanted something that was actually chemical-free. My biggest issue with sprays and repellents is the strong smell and questionable ingredients. When I started digging into **zappify reviews** and reading more about the **zappify mosquito killer**, I noticed people kept mentioning that it was completely non-toxic. Plus, **Zappify 2.0** has a **three-band UV light system** which is supposed to attract more bugs compared to older models.

Another point that caught my attention was battery life. Zappify promised up to 13 hours on a single charge and had a **USB-C connection**. Most other **indoor bug zappers** I looked at either needed to stay plugged in constantly or barely lasted through the night.

# First Impressions Setting It Up

The setup was dead simple. I charged the unit fully using the USB-C cable that came in the box. There’s a little **battery indicator readout** so you know when it’s fully powered, which is honestly a nice touch that many zapper brands don’t bother with.

When I first turned it on, the soft purple glow from the LEDs was pretty calming. No loud buzzing or crazy noises. It felt like a sleek, compact device you could use inside without it feeling intrusive.

That night, I placed the Zappify on my patio and turned off all other lights, like a few **zappify reviews reddit** users suggested for best results. Within minutes, I started hearing occasional soft pops as bugs got zapped.

# Does Zappify Work? Here’s What I Noticed

Short answer: it definitely made a difference. By the next morning, there were dozens of dead mosquitoes and small bugs collected in the bottom tray. My wife and I sat outside for coffee without needing to wave bugs away constantly.

Comparing it to other devices I’ve tried, Zappify seems to handle a **30 square meter area** really well. If you have a backyard BBQ or camping trip planned, this thing can genuinely help.

However, it’s not some magic device that instantly eliminates every mosquito from a five-acre property. You still need to use it smartly. For instance, minimizing other light sources around it really does help, just like the **zappify mosquito reviews** mentioned.

# What I Liked (And Didn't Like)

**Pros:**

* Effective against mosquitoes and small flying insects
* Super portable with a carabiner for hanging anywhere
* Really long battery life compared to other **bug zapper insect** brands
* Works indoors and outdoors
* Chemical-free and odorless

**Cons:**

* Needs a dark environment to be most effective
* The cleaning brush is small, so if you leave it running for days, it takes a few minutes to clean properly

I also noticed a few people mentioning **zappify complaints** about shipping delays, but in my case, delivery was smooth and fast.

If you're curious about the device I bought, here’s the link to the one I ordered: [**Get Zappify 2.0 Here**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/FX57R2C/?uid=41985&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/BugZapper).

# Is Zappify Legit or Just Another Gimmick?

After using it for about three weeks, I can say **Zappify 2.0** is definitely a **good bug zapper** for casual backyard use or indoor protection. It’s not a gimmick if you understand what it’s designed to do.

It tackles **mosquitoes**, **gnats**, and even a few **fruit flies** pretty efficiently without needing refills, sprays, or maintenance-heavy setups.

If you are wondering **is zappify legit**, based on my experience, it is. It feels solid, works reliably, and makes a real difference during mosquito season.

For anyone asking **does zappify work**, in a standard-sized backyard, absolutely yes. If you’re hosting a large outdoor event though, you might need two units to cover a wider area.

You can find the official listing I used here: [**Check Out Zappify 2.0 Official Site**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/FX57R2C/?uid=42592&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/BugZapper).

# Final Thoughts on Zappify Mosquito Zapper

Zappify 2.0 isn’t the cheapest **bug zapper for mosquitoes** on the market, but it’s far from the most expensive either. When you factor in the chemical-free design, strong coverage area, and portability, it feels like a solid buy.

If you’re tired of wasting money on citronella candles and sticky traps that barely work, investing in a **best bug zapper for mosquito** control like Zappify might be the smarter move.

I’ll keep using mine all summer and update if anything changes, but so far, this little device has made my nights a lot more peaceful.",1,1745742447.0,BugZapper,0,1.0,False

Chapter 33: Round 4

  
The grand, echoing halls of the Ragnarok stadium's human wing stretched out before Göll and Zach as they walked in step, their boots tapping against the ancient stone floor. The tension in the air was subtle, like the hush before a storm. Fighters waiting for their names to be called, each step bringing them closer to a fate that could end with their names carved into legend.

Göll walked with her usual quiet grace, arms crossed over her chest, while Zach trailed a step behind, looking like a man who desperately needed a strong cup of coffee and about eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Or perhaps, more pressingly, a reprieve from the third person walking with them.

Sveið, 12th of the Neo-Valkyries.

The excitable Valkyrie practically bounced at Zach's side, speaking at a relentless pace, her voice a mixture of nerves and barely-contained enthusiasm.

""I mean, can you believe it? I finally get to meet my human partner! I hope they're cool! Do you think they're cool? Maybe they're famous! Or super strong! Or cute— Oh! Speaking of cute, when are you two getting married already? Seriously, it's getting ridiculous! Everyone's placing bets, you know!""

She grinned at them, utterly oblivious to the way Zach's eye twitched. He said nothing though, a stoic sufferer of the overly enthusiastic Valkyrie's energy.

Göll, on the other hand, was valiantly holding back laughter, her lips twitching as she watched Zach's face steadily slip into the expression of a man enduring a conversation he couldn't escape from. Sveið launched into yet another tangent about hairstyles, battle formations, and her favourite types of bread before Göll mercifully raised a hand to halt her.

""Sveið, we're here.""

They stood before a heavy, medieval-themed door made of rich oak, the surface carved with swirling patterns of ivy and runes. A polished star hung in the centre like a sign on a backstage dressing room. Beneath it, in neat lettering, a single name:

'Rattenfänger'

Göll pushed the door open.

The room within was unlike the others in the human wing. Instruments from every era and culture lined the walls: harps and sitars, drum sets and cellos, flutes and modern synthesizers. Framed photographs lined the walls, and what made them extraordinary wasn't the icons in them, it was the figure with them. Mozart, Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, Beethoven, Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston... each one standing beside the same man.

At the far end of the room, seated on a stool, was that very man. Dark brown hair fell in soft waves around his face, his clothes dark and worn but well-kept. A short, broad scar ran across his throat, half-concealed by the collar of his coat. His fingers danced over the strings of a guitar, the soft, haunting notes filling the room with an ethereal calm. He hadn't noticed them enter.

Göll cleared her throat.

""Rattenfänger von Hameln!""

The man stilled. His gaze lifted to meet theirs, a flicker of mild surprise crossing his expression before a knowing smile tugged at the corners of his lips. He set the guitar down, reached for a navy blue scarf draped over the stool, and wrapped it around his neck, concealing the scar in a single practiced motion. Then he rose and approached, standing silently before the trio.

A long, awkward pause stretched out. Zach fidgeted.

""...Are you... going to say something?"" Göll prompted.

""Uh, Göll?"" Zach interjected, pointing discreetly to Rattenfänger, who was pointing to his own throat before signing something with practiced hands.

Zach sighed and translated. ""He says he's sorry, but he can't speak very well.""

Göll blinked, face softening. ""Ah... right. Sorry for that.""

Rattenfänger merely smiled, a warm, disarming thing, and signed again.

""That's alright. Now... will I fight without a weapon?""

Zach let out a breath of a laugh, translating, the humour plain even in his tired tone. Göll chuckled.

""Ah yes. Sveið!"" she snapped as she turned, catching the Valkyrie mid-reach toward a polished trophy on a nearby shelf.

""Wha—? I was just looking!"" Sveið protested, almost dropping it before setting it down gingerly. She hurried to Rattenfänger's side, her face lighting up.

""Oh my god! Are you my human partner? This is so cool! You're like super famous! I've listened to your music, and you're, like, way cuter in person and— OH YEAH I'm here to Volund with you and—""

Rattenfänger reached out, gently taking Sveið's hand and petting it with a smile, his eyes closing in an expression of simple kindness. It was disarming in its sincerity.

Sveið's words caught in her throat. Her face flushed, and she suddenly seemed incapable of continuing, mouth opening and closing like a fish.

""Well,"" Zach smirked, arms crossed. ""That got her to slow down.""

Göll nudged him, stifling a grin.

""L-Let's just do this already..."" Sveið stammered.

A glow surrounded her body, radiant and pure. Her form shimmered, dissolving into light as her body morphed into a new shape. In Rattenfänger's hands was no longer a Valkyrie, but a weapon forged for a god's demise: an electric guitar, sleek and dark with a built-in speaker face, its body inlaid with silver runes. Axe blades jutted out from its sides like lethal, gleaming wings.

Rattenfänger smirked, running a hand over the strings. The instrument hummed with ancient, holy resonance.

""Rattenfänger von Hameln,"" Göll announced with a proud smile, ""please come with us.""

The grand marble halls of Castle Olympus gleamed in the early light, the air thick with the scent of incense and nectar. The heavy, deliberate steps of Zeus, Hermes, and Ares echoed through the corridors as the trio made their way toward one of the more... notorious chambers of the divine realm.

Ares, ever the gruff warrior, scowled as he kept pace with his father and half-brother.

""Are you sure you want him to fight, Father?"" Ares grunted, his tone edged with scepticism. ""He's better off challenging his opponent to a drinking contest... or an orgy.""

Zeus said nothing, his expression unreadable, but Hermes spoke up with a knowing smirk.

""You underestimate him, Ares,"" Hermes replied smoothly, his eyes gleaming with amusement. ""Our brother may not show it, but he's a formidable fighter when the mood takes him.""

As they passed through another corridor adorned with statues of ancient victories and cosmic murals, a lesser goddess shuffled past them, barefoot and clutching her shoes in her hands. Her hair was a mess, her eyes downcast. Unmistakably doing a walk of shame.

Ares raised a brow. ""Huh. That's weird. Usually there's—""

Before he could finish, a nymph rounded the corner behind her, equally dishevelled. Hot on his heels was a male demon, shirt half-buttoned, followed by another lesser god, all moving with the same hangdog expression.

""There it is..."" Ares finished flatly, as though this were the most predictable thing he'd seen all day.

Hermes snorted softly with a chuckle, while Zeus gave a weary shake of his head.

At last, they reached the heavy double doors of their destination. Hermes pushed them open, and the trio stepped inside.

If Olympus was the epitome of celestial splendour, this room was its antithesis. The place was a wreck. Empty bottles of nectar and mortal liquors littered the floor. Discarded silk robes, wreaths of ivy, and other less mentionable items were strewn about in a chaotic mess. The sweet, heady scent of wine and sweat hung thick in the air.

It was barely a room befitting a god, yet entirely befitting this god.

At the far end of the chamber lay an enormous, sinfully luxurious bed, easily large enough to host a small gathering and judging by the number of people who'd just left, it likely had. Amid the tangle of sheets and scattered pillows reclined the god they sought.

His dark skin was flawless, practically glowing in the warm light of the room. Long, thick brown hair fell in tousled waves around his handsome, aristocratic face, and his sharp features were softened only by the heavy-lidded, hungover look in his violet eyes.

Zeus cleared his throat, his voice carrying the unmistakable authority of the King of Olympus.

""Dionysus, son, I'd like you to fight next.""

Dionysus groaned and reached for a half-empty bottle nearby, tipping it back and draining it without pause. He let out a sigh and waved a hand lazily.

""Can you not be so loud? I have a hangover,"" he grumbled, voice low and rough.

Ares bristled, fists clenching at his sides.

""Brother Dionysus! This is in no way proper for a—""

A bottle whizzed through the air and smashed against the wall just inches from Ares' head, the scent of potent alcohol splattering across the stone.

Ares spun back toward the bed, eyes narrowed, to find Dionysus sitting up, one arm still outstretched from the throw, a dangerous glare in his eyes.

""I said... shut up,"" Dionysus growled.

Hermes snorted a laugh behind his hand.

Zeus raised a hand, silencing any further argument.

""Brother Dionysus,"" Hermes said diplomatically, ""if I may, it is your turn to fight in Ragnarök.""

At this, Dionysus' glare softened into a lopsided, amused smirk. He stood up and stretched, his lean, well-built frame slipping from beneath the sheets, revealing everything.

Ares' eyes bulged, and he quickly turned away, one hand coming up to shield his gaze.

""By the Fates— put something on!"" the god of war sputtered.

Zeus and Hermes, long desensitized to Dionysus' antics, didn't so much as blink.

Dionysus chuckled darkly to himself as he strolled across the room, utterly unbothered by his state of undress, until he retrieved a deep burgundy robe from the floor. He slipped it on with casual grace and belted it loosely at the waist.

Finally, he reached for his weapon, the Thyrsus. A golden staff crowned with a massive, intricate pinecone, the tip glimmering with an otherworldly sheen. It was a relic of unholy revelry and ancient madness, capable of stirring ecstasy and ruin in equal measure.

He gave it a slow, appreciative spin in his hand, then turned to the other gods.

""You guys can leave now,"" Dionysus muttered as he strolled toward the door to his ensuite bath, voice light but dangerous beneath its slurred warmth. ""I'll be out soon.""

And with that, the door shut behind him.

Zeus gave a nod and turned, motioning for the others to follow.

""Let's go,"" he commanded.

Hermes lingered for a half-second longer, grinning to himself before following, leaving the god of madness and revelry to prepare for battle.

Back in the great stadium, a colossal arena that stretched endlessly in all directions, encircled by titanic columns and a ceiling of swirling cosmic clouds, the air was electric. Chatter rippled through the crowd like wildfire, anticipation hanging thick enough to taste. Gods, spirits, and humans alike filled the stands, their voices mingling into an eager, feverish chorus. The arena itself, once battered and bloodied from previous bouts, had been expertly restored and this time, it had been remodelled not as a battlefield, but as a grand stage.

A polished marble platform gleamed at the centre, with barricades encircling it, separating the combatants from the audience. Intricate golden motifs of vines, ivy, and musical notes adorned the walls, giving it the appearance of both a concert stage and a decadent ballroom. It was a battleground crafted for spectacle.

And then, cutting through the noise, the booming voice of Heimdall roared to life, carrying effortlessly across the expanse of the arena as he yelled into the Gjallerhorn.

""AND WE ARE BACK, LADIES AND GENTLE GODS!!"" Heimdall bellowed, his voice a flawless blend of showman's flare and battle announcer's authority. ""IT IS TIME FOR THE FATED FOURTH ROUND TO COMMENCE!!""

The crowd surged with cheers, excitement crested like a crashing wave.

Heimdall raised a hand, pointing dramatically toward one of the arena's grand tunnels.

""AND FIGHTING FOR THE HEAVENS... WE HAVE THIS GOD!!""

Spotlights flared, illuminating the entrance, and the gods and mortals leaned in.

""THIS DEITY IS ONE NOT MANY WOULD SUSPECT AS A FIGHTER! BUT DO NOT BE FOOLED BY HIS CHARM... AND DEVILISHLY GOOD LOOKS!! FOR HE IS ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTERS IN ALL THE HEAVENS!!""

The crowd stirred, whispers rippling through the gods' side.

""ORIGINALLY... THERE WERE TWELVE OLYMPIAN GODS: ZEUS... HERA... POSEIDON... DEMETER... ATHENA... APOLLO... ARTEMIS... ARES... HEPHAESTUS... APHRODITE... HERMES... AND HESTIA! BUT THIS SON OF ZEUS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO HIS FELLOW OLYMPIANS AND PROVED HIS WORTH... BECOMING... THE THIRTEENTH GOD OF OLYMPUS!!!""

A hush fell as from the tunnel's shadows, Dionysus emerged.

He was a sight to behold, dressed in a decadent blend of ancient Greek robes and modern streetwear, a long silk tunic hanging open over loose trousers, his neck adorned with gold chains and ivy wreaths. He tipped his head back, downing a bottle of wine with casual grace, the liquid dribbling down his chin. His long, brown hair tumbled in loose waves, and sleek sunglasses obscured his eyes. Resting on his shoulder was his Thyrsus, the golden staff glinting ominously under the lights.

""HE IS THE GOD OF REVELRY! THE GOD OF PLEASURE! THE GOD OF MADNESS! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY... THE GOD OF THROWING! IT! DOWN!!"" Heimdall roared.

As if on cue, Dionysus casually tossed his empty bottle to the ground. It shattered spectacularly, glass and wine spraying out in a small explosion of crimson droplets.

""THE GODS' FIGHTER IN THE FOURTH ROUND... DIONYSUS!!!""

The gods erupted, a thunderous roar filling the arena as divine beings clapped, cheered, and chanted his name. Ivy leaves swirled through the air, conjured by unseen magic. Dionysus winced slightly, rubbing his temple against his thumb.

""Ugh... my head,"" he muttered to himself.

Then Heimdall turned toward the humanity side of the arena, raising his other hand.

""AND NOW... FIGHTING FOR HUMANITY... IS... THIS GUY!!!""

A deep, aggressive guitar riff ripped through the arena's soundscape, heavy and brutal, setting mortal hearts pounding.

""BORN INTO THE GERMAN TOWN OF HAMELN, THIS MAN HAD NOTHING AS A BOY! NO PARENTS... NO FRIENDS... NOT EVEN A NAME!! ONLY A PURPOSE... DUR RATTENFÄNGER VON HAMELN... THE RAT CATCHER!!""

The music swelled, and a sound began to build from the tunnel, a chorus of faint squeaks, growing louder, a tide of verminous scuttling.

""THE PEOPLE OF HAMELN ONLY KEPT THIS POOR MUTE BOY AROUND TO RID THEM OF VERMIN! AND AS HE KEPT TO HIS PURPOSE... HE BECAME BETTER!! UNTIL ONE DAY, HE DISCOVERED A TOOL THAT WOULD MAKE HIM GREATER AT HIS JOB THAN ANYONE COULD IMAGINE... MUSIC!!!""

The guitar snarled, joined by frantic drum beats. Rats poured from the tunnel, first dozens, then hundreds, then thousands, a churning tidal wave of grey, black, and brown fur. The crowd recoiled, though a few mortals cheered wildly.

""WITH HIS FLUTE, HE CHARMED THE PESTS OF HAMELN AND LED THEM ALL AWAY!! BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO WHEN HIS PURPOSE WAS FULFILLED?! HE SOUGHT A NEW ONE... TRAVELING THE GLOBE... LEARNING INSTRUMENT AFTER INSTRUMENT... LEADING PESTS AWAY IN HIS WAKE... AND NOW... HE STANDS HERE!! THE UNDISPUTED GREATEST MUSICIAN OF ALL TIME!!""

The music hit its apex, the guitar wailing into a savage solo. Atop the writhing swarm of rats stood a figure, playing the very tune now heard across the arena. His scarf billowed. His hair cast his face in shadow, but two gleaming, crimson eyes shone beneath it.

""KNOW THE NAME... DUR RATTENFÄNGER VON HAMELN!"" Heimdall howled. ""BUT YOU MAY CALL HIM... THE PIED PIPER!!!""

The wave of rats surged forward, depositing their master gently onto the arena floor, then scattered to the barricades, the squealing mass receding like a living tide.

The crowd on humanity's side exploded in cheers, fists pumping and voices raised in celebration.

Heimdall threw both arms wide, grinning like a madman.

""I HOPE YOU'RE READY, FOLKS... BECAUSE IT IS NOW TIME... FOR THE FOURTH ROUND OF THE SECOND RAGNAROK!!!""

A roar louder than thunder split the sky, gods and humans alike howling for blood, music, madness, and glory as the two combatants faced each other at last.

Chapter 33: Round 4

  
The grand, echoing halls of the Ragnarok stadium's human wing stretched out before Göll and Zach as they walked in step, their boots tapping against the ancient stone floor. The tension in the air was subtle, like the hush before a storm. Fighters waiting for their names to be called, each step bringing them closer to a fate that could end with their names carved into legend.

Göll walked with her usual quiet grace, arms crossed over her chest, while Zach trailed a step behind, looking like a man who desperately needed a strong cup of coffee and about eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Or perhaps, more pressingly, a reprieve from the third person walking with them.

Sveið, 12th of the Neo-Valkyries.

The excitable Valkyrie practically bounced at Zach's side, speaking at a relentless pace, her voice a mixture of nerves and barely-contained enthusiasm.

""I mean, can you believe it? I finally get to meet my human partner! I hope they're cool! Do you think they're cool? Maybe they're famous! Or super strong! Or cute— Oh! Speaking of cute, when are you two getting married already? Seriously, it's getting ridiculous! Everyone's placing bets, you know!""

She grinned at them, utterly oblivious to the way Zach's eye twitched. He said nothing though, a stoic sufferer of the overly enthusiastic Valkyrie's energy.

Göll, on the other hand, was valiantly holding back laughter, her lips twitching as she watched Zach's face steadily slip into the expression of a man enduring a conversation he couldn't escape from. Sveið launched into yet another tangent about hairstyles, battle formations, and her favourite types of bread before Göll mercifully raised a hand to halt her.

""Sveið, we're here.""

They stood before a heavy, medieval-themed door made of rich oak, the surface carved with swirling patterns of ivy and runes. A polished star hung in the centre like a sign on a backstage dressing room. Beneath it, in neat lettering, a single name:

'Rattenfänger'

Göll pushed the door open.

The room within was unlike the others in the human wing. Instruments from every era and culture lined the walls: harps and sitars, drum sets and cellos, flutes and modern synthesizers. Framed photographs lined the walls, and what made them extraordinary wasn't the icons in them, it was the figure with them. Mozart, Michael Jackson, Kurt Cobain, Beethoven, Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston... each one standing beside the same man.

At the far end of the room, seated on a stool, was that very man. Dark brown hair fell in soft waves around his face, his clothes dark and worn but well-kept. A short, broad scar ran across his throat, half-concealed by the collar of his coat. His fingers danced over the strings of a guitar, the soft, haunting notes filling the room with an ethereal calm. He hadn't noticed them enter.

Göll cleared her throat.

""Rattenfänger von Hameln!""

The man stilled. His gaze lifted to meet theirs, a flicker of mild surprise crossing his expression before a knowing smile tugged at the corners of his lips. He set the guitar down, reached for a navy blue scarf draped over the stool, and wrapped it around his neck, concealing the scar in a single practiced motion. Then he rose and approached, standing silently before the trio.

A long, awkward pause stretched out. Zach fidgeted.

""...Are you... going to say something?"" Göll prompted.

""Uh, Göll?"" Zach interjected, pointing discreetly to Rattenfänger, who was pointing to his own throat before signing something with practiced hands.

Zach sighed and translated. ""He says he's sorry, but he can't speak very well.""

Göll blinked, face softening. ""Ah... right. Sorry for that.""

Rattenfänger merely smiled, a warm, disarming thing, and signed again.

""That's alright. Now... will I fight without a weapon?""

Zach let out a breath of a laugh, translating, the humour plain even in his tired tone. Göll chuckled.

""Ah yes. Sveið!"" she snapped as she turned, catching the Valkyrie mid-reach toward a polished trophy on a nearby shelf.

""Wha—? I was just looking!"" Sveið protested, almost dropping it before setting it down gingerly. She hurried to Rattenfänger's side, her face lighting up.

""Oh my god! Are you my human partner? This is so cool! You're like super famous! I've listened to your music, and you're, like, way cuter in person and— OH YEAH I'm here to Volund with you and—""

Rattenfänger reached out, gently taking Sveið's hand and petting it with a smile, his eyes closing in an expression of simple kindness. It was disarming in its sincerity.

Sveið's words caught in her throat. Her face flushed, and she suddenly seemed incapable of continuing, mouth opening and closing like a fish.

About three weeks ago, I went on a date with a man — we met for coffee, and ended up talking for two hours. The connection was immediate. Out of the 20+ dates I’ve been on, I’ve never felt anything like this before. There was a real spark between us. He kissed me afterward and even held my hand. He has a 10-year-old daughter (he shares 50/50 custody), and he’s a Dr, so his schedule is very busy.

Even so, we’ve talked every single day, non-stop, since that first date. We actually have our second date tomorrow at a restaurant.

Here’s my situation: I have a date with someone else today — but honestly, I don’t even feel like pursuing it because I really like the first guy. At the same time, I wonder if it’s too soon to put all my eggs in one basket. I’m also not sure how to cancel the date today, especially since I’ve already been talking to this second guy for a few days.

What should I do?
