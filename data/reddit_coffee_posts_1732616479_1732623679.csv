1h0ainq,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1h0ainq/honest_best_electric_stove_ever/,[HONEST] Best Electric Stove EVER,"Okay, let‚Äôs get one thing straight: I wasn‚Äôt looking for ‚Äúthe best electric stove‚Äù when I bought the [Elite Gourmet Countertop Double Cast Iron Burner](https://amzn.to/4eM220c). I was looking for *anything* that would keep me from eating instant noodles straight from the packet when my actual stove decided to ghost me. And honestly? This little burner has been a surprising MVP.

# The Good Stuff:

1. **Heat Distribution That‚Äôs Actually Decent:** I made scrambled eggs on the smaller burner (hey, I was feeling fancy), and they cooked evenly. No weird half-raw, half-burnt monstrosity that makes you question your life choices.
2. **Compact but Mighty:** It‚Äôs not winning any beauty contests, but this thing is sturdy. I live in a tiny apartment, so space is a hot commodity. This burner fits perfectly on my counter, right next to my questionable coffee maker.
3. **Perfect for My Experimental Cooking Adventures:** You know those TikTok recipes that make you think, *‚ÄúWhy not? I could totally make that.‚Äù* Well, I tried making caramel on the larger burner, and while I slightly overdid it (note to self: do NOT multitask with caramel), the burner powered through like a champ.

# The Not-So-Good Stuff:

1. **The Burner's Patience is Not Infinite:** If you crank it to high, it gets HOT. Like, ""will-singe-your-soul-if-you-touch-it"" hot. My roommate learned that the hard way when she accidentally brushed her hand against it. (She's fine, but now she approaches it like it's a feral raccoon.)
2. **Takes a Bit to Cool Down:** This thing holds heat like it‚Äôs saving it for winter. After I turned it off, it stayed warm for longer than I expected. Great for keeping food warm, not so great for my counter.

# Real-Life Test Drive:

Here‚Äôs where the humor comes in: one night, I decided to make grilled cheese. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. I miscalculated the heat (again, do not crank it to max unless you‚Äôre prepared for *war*), and my sandwich went from golden brown to ‚Äúis this charcoal?‚Äù in about 0.2 seconds. Lesson learned: this burner doesn‚Äôt mess around. But hey, at least it‚Äôs fast!

# Verdict:

If you‚Äôre in the market for the **best electric stove** (or at least a temporary replacement), the Elite Gourmet Countertop Double Cast Iron Burner is a solid contender. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs reliable, affordable, and pretty tough for its size. Just‚Ä¶ maybe keep a fire extinguisher nearby if you‚Äôre prone to kitchen chaos like me.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Would I trust myself to make caramel on it again? Probably not. But that‚Äôs a *me* problem. üòÖOkay, let‚Äôs get one thing straight: I wasn‚Äôt looking for ‚Äúthe best electric stove‚Äù when I bought the Elite Gourmet Countertop Double Cast Iron Burner.

1h0aid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1h0aid1/review_buckwheat_pillows_the_best/,[Review] Buckwheat Pillows The BEST,"Okay, so let me start by saying I was *skeptical* about buckwheat pillows. Like, **seriously, buckwheat?** Aren‚Äôt those the weird grains in some gluten-free pancakes? But after dealing with neck pain and sleep that felt more like a wrestling match, I caved and bought the [Beans72 Organic Buckwheat Pillow](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh)**.** Here‚Äôs the scoop:

# First Impressions:

When it arrived, the box was heavier than expected. For a moment, I thought Amazon accidentally sent me a sack of rice. The pillow itself? Not exactly a ""fluffy cloud"" vibe. It‚Äôs firm and kind of‚Ä¶ crinkly. But I like to give things a fair shot (plus, I already spent the money), so I swapped out my old pillow that night.

# The First Night:

It was WEIRD. The pillow makes this slight rustling sound when you move it, but it‚Äôs not annoying‚Äîit‚Äôs kind of like white noise for minimalists. It also doesn‚Äôt sink like a traditional pillow. Instead, you can smoosh the buckwheat hulls around to create the exact shape you want. My neck felt *oddly supported*, like I had a personal chiropractor chilling under my head.

**BTW I Got Mine For REALLLYYY Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh)

# Real-Life Example:

Fast forward to a week later: I‚Äôm on a Zoom call with my coworker, who *never* notices anything, and he says, ""You look really well-rested. Did you go on vacation?"" Nope, pal, just found the pillow equivalent of a supportive life coach.

Also, here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîI accidentally spilled coffee on it (because I have the coordination of a baby giraffe), and since the buckwheat hulls are in a zippered case, I just removed them, washed the cover, and we were back in business. Try doing that with memory foam!

# What I Loved:

* **Customizable comfort**: You can remove or add buckwheat hulls to get the firmness just right.
* **Natural cooling**: No more flipping the pillow 500 times to find the ""cool side."" It‚Äôs always cool, like James Dean in pillow form.
* **Relief from neck pain**: Legit, my neck hasn't felt this good since before I started binge-watching Netflix in awkward positions.

# What Might Not Be for Everyone:

* The weight. It‚Äôs not a big deal for sleeping, but if you‚Äôre someone who tosses their pillow around, prepare to get a mini arm workout.
* The rustling sound. I find it soothing, but if you‚Äôre sensitive to sounds, it might take some getting used to.
* It‚Äôs not *soft-soft.* If you‚Äôre into squishy marshmallow vibes, this isn‚Äôt for you.

# Final Thoughts:

I‚Äôm officially a buckwheat pillow convert. The [Beans72 Organic Buckwheat Pillow](https://amzn.to/3CI8qIh) has made me sleep better, stopped my neck pain, and even earned me unsolicited compliments on my appearance. Who knew buckwheat could do all that?

Now, I just need to resist the urge to tell *everyone* about my pillow like I‚Äôve joined some weird buckwheat cult. Highly recommend giving it a try!",1,1732623434.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False

Among other examples, Tesla's private 5G implementation on the shop floor
of its Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg plant has helped in overcoming up to
90 percent of the overcycle issues in the factory's GA (General Assembly)
shop; aluminum die-castings supplier IKD has replaced 6 miles of cables
connecting 600 pieces of machinery with a private 5G network; the EWG
(East-West Gate) Intermodal Terminal's private 5G network has increased
productivity from 23-25 containers per hour to 32-35 per hour and reduced
the facility's personnel-related operating expenses by 40 percent; NEC
Corporation has improved production efficiency by 30 percent through the
introduction of a local 5G-enabled autonomous transport system for
intralogistics at its Kakegawa factory; and JD Logistics has reduced the
likelihood of connection timeouts by an impressive 70 percent since
migrating AGV communications from unlicensed Wi-Fi systems to private 5G
networks at its logistics parks.

Some of the most technically advanced features of 5G Advanced ‚Äì 5G's next
evolutionarily phase ‚Äì are also being trialed over private wireless
installations. For example, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor is using an
indoor 5G Advanced network for time-critical industrial control within a
car roof production line as part of an effort to prevent wire abrasion in
mobile application scenarios, which results in production interruptions
with an average downtime of 60 hours a year.

To capitalize on the long-term potential of private 5G, a number of new
alternative suppliers have also developed 5G infrastructure offerings
tailored to the specific needs of industrial applications. For example,
satellite communications company Globalstar has launched a 3GPP Release
16-compliant multipoint terrestrial RAN system that is optimized for dense
private wireless deployments in Industry 4.0 automation environments while
German engineering conglomerate Siemens has developed an in-house private
5G network solution for use at its own plants as well as those of
industrial customers.

SNS Telecom & IT estimates that annual investments in private 5G networks
for vertical industries will grow at a CAGR of approximately 42% between
2024 and 2027, eventually accounting for nearly $3.5 Billion by the end of
2027. Although much of this growth will be driven by highly localized 5G
networks covering geographically limited areas for Industry 4.0
applications in manufacturing and process industries, sub-1 GHz wide area
critical communications networks for public safety, utilities and railway
communications are also anticipated to begin their transition from LTE,
GSM-R and other legacy narrowband technologies to 5G towards the latter
half of the forecast period, as 5G Advanced becomes a commercial reality.
Among other features for mission-critical networks, 3GPP Release 18 ‚Äì which
defines the first set of 5G Advanced specifications ‚Äì adds support for 5G
NR equipment operating in dedicated spectrum with less than 5 MHz of
bandwidth, paving the way for private 5G networks operating in sub-500 MHz,
700 MHz, 850 MHz and 900 MHz bands for public safety broadband, smart grid
modernization and FRMCS (Future Railway Mobile Communication System).

The ‚Äú[2]Private 5G Networks: 2024 ‚Äì 2030 ‚Äì Opportunities, Challenges,
Strategies & Forecasts‚Äù report presents an in-depth assessment of the
private 5G network ecosystem, including the value chain, market drivers,
barriers to uptake, enabling technologies, operational and business models,
vertical industries, application scenarios, key trends, future roadmap,
standardization, spectrum availability and allocation, regulatory
landscape, case studies, ecosystem player profiles and strategies. The
report also presents global and regional market size forecasts from 2024 to
2030. The forecasts cover three infrastructure submarkets, two technology
generations, 16 vertical industries and five regional markets.

The report comes with an associated Excel datasheet suite covering
quantitative data from all numeric forecasts presented in the report, as
well as a database of over 7,300 global private cellular engagements ‚Äì
including more than 2,700 private 5G installations ‚Äì as of Q4‚Äô2024.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Halin. Very Nervous Venlil. Honky Tonk Employee**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] December 21, 2137**

A silent battle of wills plays out before Tiltva and I, or rather nearly silent as the small Farsul girl repeatedly stomps her foot on the hardwood. Her and Ray have been locked in a stare down for a few moments now, but Ray finally speaks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask only one more time. Could you *please* give your morning greeting another try and apologize to our guests?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they ***do*** smell like Venlil! Why did you let them in here? Look at what they do to you!‚Äù

*Do we really smell? Is it good, bad, or just distinct? I guess we can‚Äôt really tell‚Ä¶ Wait, what did we do?*

Ray looks down at his scratched and scabbed arms, the result of saving Thyla from that nasty Venlil attacker. He smiles faintly and looks back at his daughter.

‚ÄúPlease just say ‚ÄòGood Morning, I‚Äôm sorry‚Äô and then come over here.‚Äù

The girl lightly growls but still complies with her dad‚Äôs command.

‚ÄúGood Morning Dad.‚Äù She turns towards us. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

She then stomps over to Ray and stops stiffly and angrily at his feet. Ray then takes his hands and cups them over her eyes before using his fingers to scratch her head and ears. She holds her rigid posture as she angrily barks at him.

‚ÄúDAD!‚Äù

Ray doesn‚Äôt stop scratching, nor does he uncover her eyes. In fact, his expression is almost indeterminate and besides the gentleness of his hands one might think he is *sad?* Soon Thyla‚Äôs tail begins to wag and her face slightly blooms blue. She barks much happier this time.

‚ÄúDaaad!‚Äù

Ray doesn‚Äôt cease his efforts, if anything he holds her tighter and keeps going. He definitely now wears a face of weary sadness. Thyla seems to notice his mood from under his hands as she barks concernedly.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

Ray softly smiles and leans over to place a ~~bite~~ kiss on the crown of her head as he uncovers her eyes. She looks back at him as he wipes away what little remains of tears from under her eyes. Finally, Ray responds to Thyla.

‚ÄúDid you clean your ears today?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

Ray narrows his eyes in response.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúRaise your ears.‚Äù

As Thyla‚Äôs floppy ears lift up above her head, Ray reaches into a back pocket on his lower pelt and removes two small paper packets. Ripping one open, he pulls out a small wet wipe and begins to clean the inside of one ear. Discarding the first wipe, he then opens the second and cleans the other ear all the while Thyla‚Äôs tail wags and she leans into his hands. Throwing away the second wipe, Ray straightens back up and addresses the three of us.¬†

‚ÄúHow ‚Äòbout I get started on breakfast? Now what to make‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt used the waffle iron in a while and this seems like as good an excuse as any.‚Äù

Tiltva asks Ray a much needed question in the kitchen of human.

‚ÄúAnd these ‚Äòwaffles‚Äô don‚Äôt have any animal products in them right?‚Äù

Surprisingly, Thyla answers for her dad.

‚ÄúNo. They. Don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Ray furls his brow and stares down at the girl.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be so antagonistic, but correct. No animal products. Now Thyla, can you set the table and get our guests some more coffee or whatever they‚Äôd like?‚Äù

Thyla nods before bringing a set of utensils, glasses, and placemats to the dining room table. Ray smiles in approval as he begins to move about the kitchen grabbing various ingredients and supplies for first meal while he starts [a song on his pad](https://youtu.be/QRuCPS_-_IA) which plays across the kitchen and dining room. Thyla then goes to the coffee pot and looks at us before signing to ask ‚ÄúMore?"". Tiltva and I both sign back ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. Thyla then goes to the fridge and grabs two drink containers. One filled with a white fluid and the other ***blood orange.***¬†

*Well, neither human or Farsul blood are orange so maybe the implications are lost on her?*

Thyla brings the containers to the table and signs ‚ÄùSit‚Äù to Tiltva and I. At the table, Thyla has become rigid again as she takes a set of glasses for us and fills one with the orange fluid and the other with the white drink. She pushes the orange one to me and the white one to Tiltva before signing ‚ÄúDrink‚Äù to us. I raise my glass to my lips and Tiltva hers to hers as we simultaneously take sips of the strange drinks.¬†

Immediately I am overwhelmed by the pure *sour* of a fruit juice that, although acidic, wonderfully coats the inside of my mouth and throat as I continue to drink. Eventually, I pull the glass away to take a breath and look to my side to see Tiltva doing the same with her half-empty mystery drink.

*Thyla is acting very nervous and it‚Äôs strange that I don‚Äôt even know the names of these fruit juices but they must be-*

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT TAKE ANOTHER SIP!‚Äù

I nearly drop my glass to the table as Ray yells over the music while pointing at Tiltva. In what is likely pure terror, Tiltva shakily lowers her glass to the table and focuses on Ray. Ray pauses the music, grabs a trash can from under the kitchen island, and walks over to us at the table. He sets the bin beside Tiltva and goes back to the kitchen to start searching through what looks like a medicine cabinet. He slams the cabinet shut in frustration and walks back over to us empty handed. By now Thyla has slowly backed out of the dining room to the kitchen and is heavily shaking in the threshold, staring not at Ray, but at us.

*Is she really that terrified of Venlil? Of us?*

‚ÄúNow Tiltva don‚Äôt be scared, but that drink is only meant for Thyla and myself and I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt pour yourself that glass, did you?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what is it? What‚Äôs going to happen to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was cow‚Äôs milk, a non-sapient cattle species from Earth, and what‚Äôs going to happen to you is some stomach cramps and an intimate relationship with a toilet in a short while. Now before you say anything, a lot of humans drink it for the nutrients and Thyla can as well due to some unique genetics.‚Äù

Tiltva doesn‚Äôt seem to care about the Farsul girl‚Äôs special ***cattle-milk*** drinking ability as she immediately starts to retch over the trash can but unfortunately nothing comes up. Ray stands fuming beside Tiltva with a hand on her shoulder while Thyla continues to cower away from all of us.

*I have to do something to break this tension. This is my fault for getting us here so early and barging in their house and waking them up.*

Thinking quick and dumb, I grab Tiltva‚Äôs glass and finish the rest of the surprisingly tasty milk in a quick chug. I lower the glass to see the three of them staring at me like I had grown horns. Ray is the first to comment.

‚ÄúHey buddy? Why the Hell did you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah Halin, why *did* you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it just causes discomfort, then I don't want you to suffer alone.‚Äù

Tiltva strokes her tail across my back and shakes her head.

‚ÄúHalin, you are an idiot through and through.‚Äù

Thyla tries to slink back into the dining room but not without unwillingly catching the attention of Ray who now whips around to face the kid.

‚ÄúDid you think that this was going to be funny or something? Well think again, because ***when*** it comes time for these two to feel the effects, they‚Äôre going to be using your bathroom!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I had to protec-‚Äù

‚ÄúBut nothing! There‚Äôs nothing to argue about. And you know what else? You can do those homework assignments that I was going to let slide today before our vacation.‚Äù

Ray then kneels down and brings the girl into his chest as he not-so-quietly whispers to her.

‚ÄúShould‚Äôve given you a heads-up they were here but you can‚Äôt treat innocent folks like that. You know I will *always* keep you safe. That said, if you need us to go over to the barn or you want to go see Miss Hilda or just back to your room or whatever, I‚Äôll still make your breakfast and bring it to you. How‚Äôs that sound?‚Äù

A small, choked sob comes from the girl as she whispers something back to her dad. Whatever her choice is, Ray whispers a quick ‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù as he releases her and stands back up.

‚ÄúSit back at the table and I‚Äôll finish up breakfast.‚Äù Ray now turns to us. ‚ÄúSorry you two about‚Ä¶ well, everything so far. This is a new one for me.‚Äù

Not sure if it comes from the absurdity of the situation or the chosen punishments, but I find myself laughing which flows to Tiltva and then the still nervous Thyla joins our giggle session. The only one not amused is Ray, who shakes his head in bewilderment.

‚ÄúI know why Girly here might be laughing but you two? You‚Äôre not going to be laughing in an hour or so.‚Äù

*He really can't see how Stars Damned silly this is?*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that this is incredibly weird. Like here we are at our human boss‚Äô house, and then his Farsul daughter gives us cattle-milk and she is going to get punished by making us use her restroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh if the punishment ain‚Äôt enough I‚Äôll gladly also take her pad away till we get back from our trip.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no, the first punishments are fine, right Tiltva?‚Äù She flicks her ears in agreement to my side. ‚ÄúBy the way, where are you going on your trip?

‚ÄúOh nowhere special. We‚Äôre just going to fly back home to Earth, but it‚Äôs Thyla‚Äôs first time coming along so she‚Äôll get to meet all the family.‚Äù

*Her first trip to Earth? That means she hasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúSo she‚Äôll be getting to see Mrs. Oakley then?‚Äù

Ray stiffens up a bit before answering. ‚ÄúThat she will.‚Äù

Ray then heads back into the kitchen to resume cooking first meal leaving us with Thyla at the table, *again.* Thyla then goes into the kitchen and fills another pitcher but this time with water for us. She then sits across the table and pours herself a glass of the milk and then takes the stick Ray had brought in earlier and *takes a bite out of it!*¬†

*Stars, are Farsul jaws and teeth actually that strong? I sort of thought that was a joke. That aside, try and make small talk.*

‚ÄúSooooo Thyla. Your dad showed us the ***videos*** yesterday and we‚Äôre really upset about what happened to you. I want to apologize on behalf of all Venlil for that man‚Äôs actions. You shouldn‚Äôt be treated that way just for being Farsul.‚Äù

Her ears perk up again as she stops chewing her stick to stare at us. She mutters quickly under her breath.

*‚ÄúWhat would you know about how Venlil feel about me?‚Äù*

‚ÄúWell, we are-‚Äù

She butts in and cuts me off before I can defend myself.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm-I‚Äôm sorry, thank you.‚Äù

*Speh, it‚Äôs hard to stay mad at a cute kid. Even though she did poison us.*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, but next time I don‚Äôt think I want any milk.‚Äù

We three burst into giggles again and I can see Ray shaking his head in the kitchen as he finishes up his cooking. He brings a stack of square strayu-like pastries over to the table and divvies one to each of our plates. He then brings back two glass bottles filled with brown liquids, a stick of a yellow-ish substance, and a brown plastic bottle to the table. Pointing at the two glass bottles, he explains their contents.

‚ÄúI recommend both of you taking a bite of the waffle first without anything on it to get a good feel for it but after that, try it with the honey and then with the maple syrup.‚Äù *Okay I‚Äôve had honey before, pretty good. I‚Äôm guessing the ‚Äòmaple syrup‚Äô is rather similar.* Ray then points to the brown bottle. ‚ÄúThis is chocolate syrup, safe for you version, which is a bit bitter but still very sweet, also give it a try.‚Äù

Tiltva points to the stick of *something* on the table. ‚ÄúWhat is that stuff? Another syrup? It looks pretty solid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, that one is for Thyla and me only. It‚Äôs also made from cow‚Äôs milk. It‚Äôs called butter and if your stomachs could handle it, you‚Äôd lather it on everything. Trust me.‚Äù¬†

Thyla nods to her dad‚Äôs words as she takes a small knife and spreads the butter across her waffle. She then takes the chocolate syrup and coats it all over her waffle before using a fork to chop it up and take a bite. Ray looks from her to us before giving a warning.

‚ÄúYeah don‚Äôt do that. Just try little bits of it at first before drowning it in syrup.‚Äù

With a shrug of my tail, I take the fork and cut off a piece of the pastry. A quick stab and I bring it up to my mouth and then‚Ä¶ *bliss.* The true description of such a food is lost in my simple thoughts. The simpleton‚Äôs account is as follows: crisp, crunchy exterior followed by a warm, fluffy interior that seems to overwhelm the tasting breath with somehow nostalgic scents. And now to try the toppings, one by one till all three have been tried, aaaaand they‚Äôre pretty equal all things considered. Though, the honey probably still wins out.

As we go through our meal, Ray begins to speak to Tiltva and I.

‚ÄúSo, you two, we still have your employment to discuss.‚Äù

Tiltva and I freeze up a bit at his statement. *Wait,* ***now*** *are we getting fired?* Ray seems to notice our reactions, but he turns to Tiltva first.

‚ÄúOpe, sorry. I meant your roles. Tiltva, if you haven‚Äôt guessed already, you‚Äôre going to learn how to sing those old Country songs, and then you‚Äôre going to perform them on stage with the band. Ah, don‚Äôt get nervous on me yet! I don‚Äôt expect you to be ready for a while, but I purchased some phonetic translators after I heard you sing, so there‚Äôs already a good set of songs to get started on.‚Äù

Ray then turns my way as Tiltva begins to nervously fidget in her seat.

‚ÄúAnd Halin, while you unfortunately didn‚Äôt get much managerial experience, I‚Äôm going to have you take over managing the Honky Tonk and restaurant. I just can‚Äôt keep doing 4 jobs at the same time.‚Äù

I nearly choke on my bite of waffle at his statement. He notices my confusedness and chuckles a bit as he continues.

‚ÄúYes, 4 jobs. My original Earth job as an automotive design engineer. A job as a hovercar design engineer here on Skalga. Managing the Honky Tonk and restaurant. And being a performer in the band. And I guess being a Dad so, it‚Äôs really 5 jobs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that explains the fancy hovercar. I was amazed that you had that many credits to spare!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful car isn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm pretty proud of it and damn excited they let me keep it for a miniscule buyout. Anyway, a few more things you should know while employed here. A few of the human staff also live on site in the second barn while Kam and his grandmother Brelkam live in the original farm house. We let them stay when we bought the land. Also, because this place is still ‚Äòpredatory‚Äô to the media and political landscape, please don‚Äôt bother anyone famous or important you might recognize. They tend to like to pretend they don‚Äôt come here.‚Äù

Thyla‚Äôs ears pop up and she quickly swallows the food in her mouth as she starts nearly bouncing in her seat. Ray looks at her and a small sense of panic slowly flows across his face as Thyla starts to excitedly speak.

‚ÄúOh you mean like when Magistrate Kelyn was- mpmmphp!‚Äù

In a flash, Ray‚Äôs hand snaps over Thyla‚Äôs snout and closes her mouth but carefully leaving her nose exposed to not suffocate her.

*Magistrate Kelyn was what?!*

‚ÄúGirly, please don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Thyla tries to mumble a bit more before appearing to calm down. Suddenly, she takes a sharp inhale through her nose and blasts it out again, covering her dad‚Äôs hand in snot. Ray jerks his hand back and looks down at it in a half-genuine, half-faux scream.

‚ÄúAhhhhhhhh!‚Äù

He jumps up to go wash his hand while Thyla uses the opportunity to continue her story.

‚ÄúMagistrate Keyln came in and got suuuuper drunk and then tried kissing one of the human bartenders! And when Dad stepped in to pull her away, she started yelling about ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to sue and shut you down‚Äô but Dad still got her a taxi home! Then she called the next day and still threatened us if we ever told the news! And then Chief Exterminator Begelen-‚Äù

‚ÄúThyla! That‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

Thyla shrinks down in her seat, but not enough to stop her tail from wagging at her recount of the story. Tiltva and I shared a humorous glance before looking back at Ray whose expression clearly lays the law down, ‚ÄòNo generating news stories or gossip‚Äô. Ray rejoins us at the table and gives a gentle, but condescending head pat to his daughter.

The rest of the meal goes by happily with just a bit more small talk but mostly eating more waffles. What few words that are said come from Thyla as she talks about how excited she is to experience her first Christmas.

*Christmas does sound like a lot of fun. I wish we had more holidays of that length, but I guess we work a lot less than humans do.*

Ray stops eating long before his daughter and us and he seems content to just listen along. After we all finish, Ray and Thyla quickly collect the glassware and utensils and do the dishes in only a moment's notice. Ray then turns to speak to all of us once more.

‚ÄúThyla kiddo, best get started on that homework so you won‚Äôt have to do any on the trip home. I‚Äôd prefer if you kept to the studio while you work to help Tiltva in case she needs any help with the equipment.‚Äù

Thyla then wraps her dad in a light hug before walking back down the halls of the house towards the ‚Äòstudio‚Äô. Satisfied that she‚Äôs out of earshot, Ray beckons us over and continues.

‚ÄúThank you two for being so‚Ä¶ patient with her. She‚Äôs been through a lot and is a very tough kid, but these past few days have been ***Hell***. Huge regression on the progress we‚Äôve made but I think your attitudes here have really helped to bring her back.‚Äù

Tiltva answers for me in her ever wonderful voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ***not*** happy about being tricked but I just can‚Äôt stay mad at her. She‚Äôs been very sweet and funny to listen to all of first meal. While I can say ‚Äòyour welcome', I‚Äôll also say thank you for letting us have first meal like family. It means a lot.‚Äù

Ray then pulls us into a quick hug which Tiltva and I both happily reciprocate. Ray stands back up and is about to speak when a loud gurgle emanates from the lovely woman beside me. Tiltva‚Äôs ears and snout instantly turn bright orange as Ray purses his lips and shakes his head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not sure how well you two can smell so while I was serious about using Thyla‚Äôs bathroom, you can use the extractor fan if you want.‚Äù

Tiltva nods and flicks an ear before taking off down the hall to fight for her life. As I turn to comment to Ray about the still incredible absurdity of it all, my own stomach gives the first warning sign. No questions needed, Ray immediately understands what I need to know.

‚ÄúThe main level guest bathroom is down past the living room, meet me up in my office when you are feeling better.‚Äù

*Stars protect me in my imminent battle of life and death.*

I've been experimenting with different brewing methods lately, and I noticed there's a lot of confusion about whether you can make regular coffee with an espresso machine. The short answer is yes, but there's more to it than you might think.

I remember when I first got my espresso machine, I was pretty much clueless about the differences between espresso and regular coffee. After countless cups and some research, I've figured out how to make both perfectly.

Here's the deal: While espresso machines are designed primarily for making concentrated shots of espresso, you can actually make something very similar to regular coffee using a technique called the Americano. It's basically espresso shots mixed with hot water, and it tastes amazing!

I've tried various machines, and honestly, some work better than others for this dual purpose. After trying several models, I found this awesome machine that's perfect for both espresso and regular coffee: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

The main differences between espresso and regular coffee are:
- Brewing pressure (espresso uses high pressure, regular coffee doesn't)
- Grind size (espresso needs fine grounds, regular coffee uses medium)
- Brewing time (espresso is quick, regular coffee takes longer)

Pro tip: If you want to make regular coffee with your espresso machine, start with a double shot of espresso and add about 6-8 ounces of hot water. This creates a drink that's very similar to drip coffee but with a richer flavor profile.

I've discovered that the key to getting it right is using the right machine. Some models even come with special features for making both types of coffee. If you're interested in getting one that can do both, check out this selection: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Important things to consider when making regular coffee with an espresso machine:
1. Water temperature matters (195-205¬∞F is ideal)
2. Use the right grind size for what you're making
3. Clean your machine regularly
4. Pay attention to water quality

The best part about using an espresso machine for both drinks is the versatility. You can make everything from lattes and cappuccinos to regular coffee, all with one machine. Plus, you'll save counter space and probably some money in the long run.

Remember, while it's totally possible to make regular coffee with an espresso machine, the taste will be slightly different from what you get with a drip coffee maker. Many people (including me) actually prefer this method because it gives you more control over the strength and flavor of your coffee.

[Gothamist article about the Intellipure Compact deal with NYC schools](https://preview.redd.it/u9jnv8lmj83e1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=e631e27e0feea2d0479acf9aa1f7a2ecfebba520)



So, did NYC and Chicago schools make the right call? 

To find out, we performed the same set of tests we ran on all air purifiers we reviewed to measure how effective and efficient the Intellipure Compact is at cleaning the air. 

We paid special attention to air cleaning performance at low fan speeds, as classrooms need a quiet atmosphere (less than 45 dBA) for the best learning conditions. 

[One of our followers on Twitter asked us to test this air purifier](https://preview.redd.it/b7qj6pz0k83e1.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=db75b6be4fa9394e46e1c408351f1e92fa406e86)

  
We'd love to say this was a great deal, but the reality is that the Intellipure Compact is way too loud to be effective in classrooms. And if teachers were to set them to low fan speeds to reduce noise, they would end up with an air purifier that won't be able to provide five air changes per hour in even the smallest of classrooms.

Furthermore, I measured the potentiometer on the front board, and it seems to work as intended.... I'm out of ideas. Any advice is welcomed. I have no idea which component is at fault.

I've been living in Germany for over 15 years now. I became a citizen, have a stable life, and work as a senior software engineer with a very decent salary.

Now in my forties, I‚Äôm starting to feel the weight of time passing by. The German lifestyle and routine no longer satisfy me. I‚Äôm a frequent traveler to northern Italy, and although it‚Äôs not as warm as the south, I always feel happier there. I love everything about it, the old roads, historic stone houses, new houses,, warmer weather, the animated way people speak, the coffee, the food, the bars, the country side, the magical peace of the small villages, and the overall atmosphere. Even the little perfect imperfections (except for waiting 30 minutes at highway tolls!) feel charming to me.

For me, money isn‚Äôt the priority. Even if my income were slightly reduced, I‚Äôd be content as long as I could enjoy the lively Mediterranean lifestyle. It feels like an intrinsic part of who I am as a person. Enjoying a piece of ciabatta dipped in olive oil gives me more joy than owning the fanciest car in Germany.

I‚Äôm also aware that the healthcare system in northern Italy is excellent, and the leisure infrastructure is fantastic, which gives me peace of mind.

If I were 100% financially independent, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to settle in one of Italy‚Äôs southern cities or even a remote island. For now, I‚Äôm considering moving at least to the north, where I feel more at home and can find greater peace of mind.

I would really appreciate it!

I haven't bought anything yet, what would you add or remove from this stack? And do the dosages and timings look ok to you?

Please help me save and regain control of my life, thanks very much for reading and commenting.

I have been thinking about my ex a bit more than usually recently (he dumped me out of nowhere almost 4 months ago over the phone, but we had coffee over a month ago after which we ende don good-ish terms, i still hold a lot of resentment though). Yesterday, to make myself feel better, I asked my roommates (who have seen the whole relationship from start to end) what made them dislike my ex (he was a great boyfriend and I think I'm still very attached to him, but there were instances during which he cussed me out over text, called me a wh0re, a cun1 a b!tch and useless to have, i know it sounds bad but apart from that i loved him so so much). So my roommates responded, told me all the reasons why they disliked him (the way he spoke, the way he has a lot of girlfriends, his voice, and other things). It made me feel better. But after that, I went to sleep and had a dream of him in which he looked so bad. Really unkept, long greasy hair, way chubbier, almost unrecognizable tbh. What does this mean? Is it a good thing? I've been trying to manifest him back into my life but maybe I shouldnt. Also when we were still together (right after an argument in which he texted me that I was a cun1 and a b!tch) I had a dream once that all my hair was falling out and I was screaming and crying asking for help and he was just sat on the sofa and didnt bat an eye.

This month on the day when my period would be due I had some bleeding and shedding of what looked like endometrial tissue on my ghost period day 1. I went to hospital thinking my internal stitches had maybe come loose. The Gynae checked me and said I was completely sealed at the top but that I did have some discharge on the walls of my vagina. So they swabbed me for infection and I will get my results back on Friday. I didn't have any markers in my blood for infection and I felt fine. 

Today the bleeding has turned into tiny coffee granules and I feel fine. I'm now starting to wonder if I have endometriosis in the top of my vagina. I'm going to see my surgeon tomorrow to discuss this possibility. I also had slight spotting last period but just assumed it was stitches dissolving. 

I was told years ago that one of my ovaries had been fused by endometrial tissue to my uterus via a vaginal ultrasound scan after a mirena coil perforation. So clearly there was something going on 10 years ago. But the Dr didn't see any endometriosis during my surgery this year. I don't think he could see much as I had a huge uterus and 13cm fibroid in the way, which he had to slice in half to take out vaginally.

After two happy years, I got a good job in another state. We talked about moving, he was on board and supportive. But later, he would admit to resenting me and regretting the decision. I tried so hard to make it up to him over the years. I guess he never let it go.
Apparently, eight years ago, in the two weeks I had moved for the new job and he was still in our old home, he got on an app and fucked some stranger. And then just kept doing that, for eight years. 
I knew something was wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what, and I just went crazy. I wound up in the psych ward three times over three years, between 2019 and 2022. I loathe to overuse the words ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù and ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù, but once he admitted this two nights ago, everything clicked into place. No more confusion, just a harsh, clear reality I could not deny anymore. It all made such awful, horrible sense.
This man was my best friend. We laughed at everything. I made him coffee every morning. He held me every night. My head in his lap or his head in mine. He made so many promises. I thought he was depressed, needed my support, that I had let him down by the move and I could make it up to him. That I could save his sister. That I had to get psychologically better because the hospitalizations had been hell for HIM. Thinking of the secret contempt he must have had for me the whole time makes my skin crawl. 
I know without a doubt that divorce is the only option. I‚Äôm just so sad for who I could have been if he had just left me eight years ago. I could have met someone new, started a family. What a miserable coward. 
It‚Äôs been a crazy two days. One minute I‚Äôm laughing with my friends and family, who have all been fucking incredible. The next I‚Äôm sobbing. I can‚Äôt wait for this part to be over, for enough time to pass and I see that he never patched the hole in my life, he was the hole the entire time. Onward and upward, and fuck him.

Through the start of the friendship she told me she liked girls, this is how we ended up being such close friends cause we would just talk about relationships. We never dated in middle school. Flash forward freshman year, I decided to tell her I had a crush on her. To my surprise, she said she liked me back and never knew if she liked guys, just that she knew we had a connection and kind of thought she liked guys. 

We dated for 2 months and then this is where I messed up. Our relationship went a bit $exual as I was a young teenage boy. I could tell she got a bit uncomfortable because the next day she broke up with me. I messed up again and asked to be FWB and she got upset. This is the last true chance I had with her.

Summer before sophomore year: I asked her to be my girlfriend again and she said she still needed time. I wrote her a letter and she called me the next day saying she doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship. 

Start of sophomore year,: I wrote her another letter telling her I was in love with her and she rejected me. She told me she didn‚Äôt think I was in love with her and that it was a fixation. I kept trying over sophomore year and she just kept rejecting me.

Junior year: I gave it one last chance and asked her to homecoming. I made a sign and everything, she said yes at first then called me later that day telling me she was put on the spot and didn‚Äôt want to be mean. I kept writing her letters but I honestly think she just put them in the trash. Now I‚Äôm starting to get upset because we spent everyday together and she just doesn‚Äôt want to be together.

I romantically leave her alone senior year. We ended up going to prom together. I thought she started to like me but then things got messy. I made a fake profile on instagram and messaged her off it (she had an online stalker in the past). She found out and I admitted I was still in love her and there was not a second of any day I didn‚Äôt think of her. I asked her if she loved me back, she said no. I got blocked and we didn‚Äôt speak for a couple months. 

(Now in our 20‚Äôs) Eventually, she agreed to meet me for coffee and I apologized for everything. She forgave me and it was like we back to being best friends since day 1. It was amazing, even better (I knew she was hooking up with boys and girls but she never  told me anything just stuff I heard through others). 

I asked her to be my girl during the summer, I confessed everything truly to her face and she gave me some hope. She told me she knew we had a connection but that was all it was. She said she was into guys. Later that night, she texted me telling me I was being disrespectful because I ‚Äúignore her feelings‚Äù and made her ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù. She said she would block me if I told her how I felt again. 

Two weeks later I wrote her a letter. This one made her extremely upset and led to me being permanently blocked. I wrote that I felt like her man, that we do have a connection, that she is the only person I think of, that she is my God, and that I think she loves me too. She yelled at me and we said goodbye in person, and since then I have been blocked on everything. 

Now, I am upset. AITAH for feeling this way? I loved her with everything and she treated me like a boyfriend. We could go on dates but without the relationship stuff ( I come from a German family and my brother says this is not normal for a friendship). We would see movies, get lunch, get afternoon drinks, sometimes dinner. She would ask me how she looks. Does she feel the same? I‚Äôm upset because she may be letting this connection go away because she‚Äôs afraid. ",1,1732619167.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

I do recommend trying it out after you recruited everyone to the Veilguard. Will also give you some Lucanis romance content without a huge drought in between Act 1 and 2.

Not funny cause they literally think any problem that comes to their life is because of me. (M 30, F 28) ","2 very close childhood friends called me ‚Äòkaali jubaan‚Äô in secrecy and now contacting to attend an event. What to do? 

My very close 2 Friends are committed to each other for years (9 to be precise) 
Now we used to study in school together, they got committed done and there I was very close friend to both of them in my school and my college, and even after that . However, they both decided to fly to US for studies.

So one day, they call me for coffee and and told me that they have something special to announce. Now, since I know them from the beginning and we were at marriageable age, I thought they are about to announce their engagement or marriage plans. However, on coffee, they announce that they are moving to US. I was surprised because I was expecting something else, and I think it showed on my face. 

However, I congratulated them both, and we hugged and we celebrated . Then I slowly started asking what studies or subjects have been taken and which university the usual staff you know. In mid of our conversation, I also asked them about the visa applications and if it has approved. 

So apparently, the girls visa was approved, the visa was about to be approved that that time. 

I just said ‚Äòa lot of visa are being rejected these days. I hope you get your visa.‚Äô 

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs what I said, I didn‚Äôt read the line. I didn‚Äôt mean anything else. I just said the fact. 

Fast forward to now almost 2 years after seems the guys visa never got approved, and they directly or indirectly blame My Kali Zuban for it . 

In these two years, they never contacted me directly and told that I have Buri Nazar and Kali Zabaan to one of our mutual friend. Who by the way, told me about them. 

Apparently, they got married, and they did not even thought once of informing me, forget about inviting . It broke my heart because I was the one who made them meet years ago, and I always rooted for them. I also help their parents meet each other despite having differences. Because I was the close to their individual families. 

When I asked my mutual friend, why did they not inform me about their secret wedding? I got the answer because they strongly strongly believes that I have Buri Nazar. And if they invite me, it might bring bad omen upon their marriage. 

Now, after two years, one of them is coming back to India and is inviting me to get together party. I feel betrayed. I don‚Äôt want to go, but I do not know how to deal with this situation when I am so mad at them, but can‚Äôt say anything to them.

1h096ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h096ra/aitah_stepdaughter_edition/,AITAH stepdaughter edition: ,"Second post I‚Äôm making about this topic.

I gave my flat over to my stepdaughter so that she could go to uni and have a better future. We moved out to a bigger house in the countryside cos I‚Äôm
Pregnant. We arranged for family to cover all stepdaughter‚Äôs bills (there‚Äôs also an extreme housing crisis in our city so she was very lucky to get a whole flat to herself). She abused our kindness, stole money, used my credit card behind my back, & trashed the place. Dropped out of all classes and then went home to her mother when we tried to make her accountable. Didn‚Äôt say goodbye , thanks or sorry. 

I just had my 22 week baby scan and came to the flat to turn off the heating since it‚Äôs empty now. It‚Äôs completely trashed with rotten piles of food under the bed, in the lounge room and piles of trash everywhere. I started cleaning and counted 8 bags so far. I‚Äôm also supposed to work today. 
I took a pic of the trash bags, the spat out chewing tobacco next to the bed, the huge stains on the freshly painted walls that looks like someone threw coffees against the wall in every room.

I was about to text my stepdaughter (we haven‚Äôt spoken since she left , I have not said a single word of disapproval so far), something like ‚ÄúI just got back from my baby scan and all is great. It wasn‚Äôt great to clean the flat‚Äù and send her pics of the trash bags I collected so far. I also can‚Äôt clean with the hard chemicals required to disinfect the place due to the pregnancy. But it stinks rotten in here.

Before I press send , I am having second thoughts. Maybe it‚Äôs better I handle it in a different way.

How do I handle it now?
1- tell the grandmother (my husband‚Äôs mother) who is the source of the unlimited cashflow what happened
2- tell my husband‚Äôs ex, the mother of my stepdaughter, what happened so that my stepdaughter gets a talking to
3- text my stepdaughter directly I‚Äôm not happy with her behaviour 
4- do absolutely nothing and just refuse to engage or communicate with the stepdaughter again. 

Btw/ My husband‚Äôs plan is just to call his mother and explain everything directly. Problem with my husband is I just don‚Äôt know what he will say but I know he will downplay it. For example he still hasn‚Äôt mentioned the credit card use.  He said I can do anything I want in addition to that. He doesn‚Äôt want to communicate with his ex or send photos and stuff cos he thinks it‚Äôs petty 

Background‚Äî

I (37F) 22 weeks pregnant with first kid am married to my husband (38M). We are hard working professionals trying to make it work in a big city as migrants. We are getting there and we work really hard.

My husband has a kid from a previous relationship, 19F, call her Anna. When the relationship broke down 9 years ago, husband left his home country in Scandinavia so the ex, Marie 37F had full time custody but lived a lavish lifestyle on behalf of the $$$ extreme cashflow coming in from my husband‚Äôs mother, Sandra 65F.

I have been honestly the model of a perfect stepmother even if I do say so myself. I‚Äôve only been around for 4 years and I have done so much to include her and improve her life, including taking her on overseas holidays with my side of the family, helping with her uni and future, being emotionally there and her friend and all of that. Most recently giving her my flat with all my antique furniture and also arranging an internship for her at my company which she just destroyed. 

Which of my choices above do I go with to be less of the AH to me and my baby? 

I KNOW I am going to be the AH in the future when my husband wants stepdaughter to come and visit and I only don‚Äôt want her around. She‚Äôs burned her bridges with me in a way that she can‚Äôt with her own parents. 
I know it‚Äôs going to be a topic in the future when I will be the wicked evil stepmother, so what can I do now to prevent me being that AH in the future ",5,1732618585.0,AITAH,7,0.86,False

Because it's in this episode that Lynch & Frost highlight the main thematic throughline of the show, which is that  one has to find happiness in the here and now, and not to live life for the past or the future. Is it future or is it past? I think it's always the present.

We see that most clearly in the scene where Sonny Jim gets his (ridiculously tacky) gym set. At that moment, Dougie has everything. His wife and son are happy. His actions uplift the community around him. He himself finds joy in the little things - cherry pie and coffee. Living a fulfilling life doesn't have to be some titanic struggle.

We see it with Shelly and Becky. Both of them are distraught and unable to connect until Shelly invites Becky to the Double RR diner. Once again, cherry pie saves the day. Simple things.

We see it with Nadine and Jacoby, who bond over Jacoby's new message of digging your way out of the shit. They bond over their mutual hatred of the government, but despite the viciousness of how the message is delivered, *they don't actually do anything against the government*. Jacoby seems to be more about uniting the people in a common cause rather than causing any substantial act of defiance or spite.

On the middle of the spectrum, we have people like James, Ed and Audrey, who all seem lost in the past. James still sings his emo love song, except Maddie and Donna are long gone and replaced by faceless backup singers. Ed still pines for Norma. Audrey compares her strange situation to Ghostwood (the only mention of Ghostwood in season 3).

The people concerned for the future are men like Jeffries, Major Briggs and of course Cooper himself, who all get sucked away one by one. Gordon Cole is on the edge himself, coming to the shattering realization that we 'live inside a dream' (a metaphor for how fleeting life is, I think). Albert finds his happiness with the coroner, in the here and now.

It reminds me a little of The Sopranos, of Tony Soprano's hatred and jealousy for the ""happy wanderer"". Much like David Chase, I think Lynch wants us to cheer on the happy wanderer, and not get too carried away with our obsessions.

I think episode also highlighted the main flaw of The Return, which is that a beautiful, golden episode like this is trapped in a swamp of useless filler. Most of the plot of The Return is just about trying to shove Mr C back into the Black Lodge, with Jeffries/Briggs/MIKE/the Giant all working as some kind of cabal to lead him on a wild goose chase. Unlike this episode, none of it really means anything because the show is unengaged with Mr C as a character. He's just a big plot device that everything else the writers really care about hangs on.

I am massively theorising here, but it feels like Mark Frost wanted to indulge in his conspiracy obsessions, while Lynch wanted to indulge in his various dreamy ideas. So the framing device of having Mr C chase those stupid coordinates all season (while leading a whole army of people against Dougie!!) is like a weird compromise to give them both what they want out of Twin Peaks while also resolving a cliffhanger that neither person was interested in.

***The original intention of Mr C as Cooper's doppleg√§nger, dark half and the new host of BOB is largely irrelevant to this show. It is not the story of The Return, and I wish it didn't take up so much time.*** 

NOTES:

* I love that the Mitchum Bros made their casino employees set up a gym set. Poor people must've been so confused.
* Despite my disappointment with Mr C as a character, I do find him to be one of the most enjoyable to watch. I think MacLachlan has a tremendous presence.
* I think I missed how Richard Horne is involved with Ray's gang? Is Red meant to be a member too?
* Why do the three cop brothers have an ancient landline phone?
* Props to the actor playing Anthony Sinclair. He's the GOAT of this episode.
* What did Sinclair think Dougie was doing to him that made him confess?
* Dougie being unintentionally intimidating was the biggest laugh of the episode.
* It's so good to see Everett McGill again... why does he have such a horrible haircut?
* For someone who has let themselves go, Sarah Palmer's house sure looks nice and tidy.
* Is the footage of the boxing on TV looping?
* I've still no idea what's going on with Audrey, except maybe Charlie is her therapist or something, and hoping that going to the Roadhouse will break Audrey's delusions? The lines about ending her story just feel like Lynch being meta. Is Audrey comparing herself to Laura Palmer when she talks about the girl who lived down the lane?
* Sherilyn Fenn gives such a terrific performance, I hate that she's wasted in that weird subplot. There's so much they could have done with her. Have her in the FBI, have her with Mr C, anything.

You see, sugar can lead to inflammation and increased blood flow in our bodies, which is the last thing we need down there. So, if you've got hemorrhoids or you're prone to them (like me, unfortunately), it might be time to lay off the sugary treats.

But hey, let's not get too serious here. We all deserve a sweet indulgence now and then, right? Just remember, moderation is key ‚Äì for both your taste buds and your hemorrhoids! üòÖ

When people try to show empathy with empty words, it enrages and saddens me. I know they mean well, but they‚Äôll never grasp how exhausting it is to live with this injury, especially when it keeps me up at night, worsening my mental state. Sometimes, silence would be more comforting than shallow attempts to relate.

I‚Äôm 22 years old. My birthday was in September, but I haven‚Äôt celebrated it in two years. I just don‚Äôt have the mental energy. I haven‚Äôt attended any family gatherings either. Yesterday, my dad called, saying it was okay if I couldn‚Äôt come to his birthday party on December 8th. Do you know how heartbreaking it is to tell your dad, *‚ÄùI wish I could‚Äù*?

This all started on **April 18, 2022, at 8:42 AM** - during a deadlift. I remember the exact moment because it‚Äôs seared into my memory. It happened right before my high school graduation, and I couldn‚Äôt celebrate like everyone else. Nobody understood the pain I was in, and those I told dismissed it as ‚Äúnot that bad.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt invited to my classmates‚Äô celebrations because they found my behavior ‚Äúweird.‚Äù Outwardly, I looked fine, but inside, I was breaking, watching others enjoy life while I struggled with searing back pain radiating down my leg like boiling water.

What makes it harder is knowing all of this could have been avoided. I started going to the gym because I was insecure - bullied for the one thing I excelled at: gaming. For years, gaming was my passion and escape. I played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitively, reaching a top-300 level in Denmark after 10000 hours on record. After primary school, I even attended one of the country‚Äôs top esports boarding schools, honing my skills before heading to high school. Gaming gave me confidence, but the bullying made me doubt myself. People mocked me for being ‚Äújust a gamer,‚Äù and I thought that if I improved my appearance, I‚Äôd earn their respect.

My gaming journey was filled with highs, even moments I was proud of. At Denmark‚Äôs biggest LAN party, with over 5000 attendees, I competed in a 2v2 tournament with another guy from the boarding school. I was disqualified for cheating because professional coaches - who had worked with top-tier teams like Astralis - claimed they‚Äôd never seen movement like mine before. They couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly I locked onto enemies, milliseconds after spotting them. It wasn‚Äôt cheating; it was years of practice and dedication. Instead of discouraging me, the accusation fueled my confidence in my skills.

But that confidence didn‚Äôt extend to my personal life. As soon as I had dropped out of the boarding school because of being insecure about myself, I became fixated on my appearance, tracking calories obsessively and prioritizing the gym over everything else. I ignored months of lower back pain, dismissing it as nothing serious. I worked out 6/7 days every week, pushing through the upper limit of my body‚Äôs capabilities, trying to prove to myself and others that I wasn‚Äôt weak. Then, during that fateful deadlift, I felt a sharp, electric pain shoot through my lower back. That was the moment everything changed - the day I unknowingly said goodbye to the life I knew.

Even if one day I somehow get better - pain-free or not - I know I‚Äôll carry the trauma of these past 2.5 years with me for the rest of my life. I‚Äôve lost so much of who I was, and the memories of being bedridden, isolated, and overlooked will never truly leave me. These years have reshaped me in ways I can‚Äôt undo. They‚Äôve stolen my freedom, my trust in my body, and my hope for the future. Healing physically won‚Äôt erase the mental scars of this relentless battle.

After graduation, I moved to a new city to pursue a degree in software engineering. For two years, I managed to push through, but about two months ago, everything fell apart. I‚Äôve been bedridden most days since then. The mental toll has been immense, worsened by the lack of support. I didn‚Äôt make friends at the start of university because I skipped all the parties and social events, rushing home after classes to lie down and get even the slightest relief.

Living alone for the past two years, I haven‚Äôt had a single visitor, shared a coffee, or even had casual conversations. The only person I occasionally text is a childhood friend who doesn‚Äôt know about my condition. I‚Äôm scared to tell him, fearing he might leave too. It‚Äôs terrifying how quickly people disappear when you can‚Äôt offer anything but pain and complaints.

As for love? I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. I‚Äôve tried chatting with women, but when I bring up my back problems, many seem to pull away. I understand - most people want a partner to share adventures with, not someone confined to a bed. There‚Äôs one girl I‚Äôve been talking to who feels different. She‚Äôs genuinely kind, often reaching out to me after days of silence, and she seems to care. But she lives far away, and I‚Äôm scared to fully open up about the severity of my situation, worried it might push her away too. I‚Äôve mentioned that I have back problems, but I haven‚Äôt explained just how debilitating it really is. Traveling to see her is impossible; even a short walk leaves me in unbearable pain. The last time I took public transport, I endured the entire trip in silence, afraid to inconvenience the person sitting next to me, even as I suffered.

The hardest part of this injury is going outside and seeing everyone else living their lives freely. It‚Äôs impossible not to compare yourself, and even if you try not to, the mask crumbles the moment you‚Äôre alone.

I recently had an epidural injection in my L5-S1 area, but it didn‚Äôt help. My next option is a facet joint injection, though I‚Äôve lost hope it will do any difference. My L5-S1 disc is so degenerated it‚Äôs nearly black, and I have an annular fissure causing centralized back pain. Because the disc hasn‚Äôt extruded - only protruded 3.5mm - surgeons refuse to operate, saying I‚Äôm too young and it will heal in time. But after 2.5 years of getting worse, I‚Äôm just waiting for the day I can‚Äôt get out of bed at all. I recently lost my part-time job, and next up is probably going to be my degree, just before I lose myself.

What‚Äôs baffling is why my pain has worsened despite no significant changes in MRI results over the years. Each scan looks identical, yet my condition deteriorates.

I don‚Äôt know if sharing this will help anyone, but I needed to let it out. I‚Äôm having a terrible day - several in a row, actually. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly giving up. Right now, I‚Äôm just existing, waiting for a miracle I don‚Äôt believe will come.

If you‚Äôre young like me, in your early twenties, feeling like you‚Äôve lost your friends, your career, your family, your chance at love, and - most painfully - yourself, just know you‚Äôre not alone.

I‚Äôm not the person I used to be.",0,1732617498.0,Sciatica,0,0.5,False

Have you ever been stuck with no WiFi while traveling, working remotely, or even just in a public space where the internet is painfully slow or unsafe? If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably experienced the frustration of unreliable connections. That‚Äôs where **portable mobile WiFi devices** come in. These little gadgets claim to provide stable, fast, and secure internet access no matter where you are.

I recently started using the **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi**, a compact device that has become my go-to for staying connected while on the move. Since portable mobile WiFi is a growing trend, I wanted to share my thoughts‚Äîwhat works, what doesn‚Äôt, and how this gadget fits into my daily life.

# What Exactly is a Portable Mobile WiFi Device?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. A portable mobile WiFi device, like the **Ryoko portable WiFi**, creates a personal WiFi hotspot by connecting to nearby 4G LTE towers. Think of it as your own little router that you can take anywhere. It‚Äôs great for connecting multiple devices, like your phone, laptop, or tablet, without draining your phone‚Äôs battery or relying on unsecured public networks.

The concept is simple, but not all portable WiFi devices are created equal. Some offer limited coverage, slow speeds, or short battery life. I picked the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi** because it seemed to tick all the right boxes: **global coverage in 76 countries**, fast internet speeds, and long-lasting battery life.

# My Experience with MUAMA Ryoko WiFi

When I ordered the **Ryoko portable WiFi**, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what to expect. I‚Äôve tried other mobile hotspots before, and while they were okay, they always seemed to fall short in one way or another‚Äîeither the battery wouldn‚Äôt last, or the connection was spotty.

# Setup: Simple and Quick

The first thing that stood out about Ryoko was how easy it was to set up. The device comes with a pre-installed SIM card, so there‚Äôs no need to hunt for one. All I had to do was:

1. Turn it on using the power button.
2. Scan the QR code with my phone.
3. Connect, and I was good to go.

Even if you‚Äôre not great with gadgets, the **Ryoko WiFi** setup process is super straightforward. It‚Äôs basically plug-and-play, which is a big plus for me.

# Performance: Does It Actually Work Well?

This is the real test, right? Here‚Äôs how **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi** performed in different scenarios:

# Speed and Reliability

In cities, the connection was fantastic. I consistently got download speeds of up to **150 Mbps**, which is great for streaming HD videos, working on cloud-based documents, and even gaming. Even with multiple devices connected, the speeds stayed stable.

In rural areas or during road trips, the speeds were slower, but I was still able to browse, check emails, and even make video calls without too much trouble. The **Ryoko WiFi** automatically connects to the strongest local cell tower, which makes a big difference in maintaining a reliable connection.

# Battery Life

One of the standout features of the **Ryoko portable WiFi** is its battery life. It lasts up to **15 hours on a single charge**, which is much better than using my phone‚Äôs hotspot. I‚Äôve used it during long travel days without worrying about it dying.

# Multiple Device Support

This is another feature I love. You can connect up to **8 devices** at once, so my friends and I were able to share the connection during a weekend trip. No one had to rely on spotty public WiFi, and everyone was happy.

# What Makes MUAMA Ryoko WiFi Unique?

Here‚Äôs why I think **Ryoko portable WiFi** stands out from the crowd:

1. **Global Coverage**: It works in **76 countries**, including the US, Canada, Europe, and parts of Asia. I tested it during trips to Italy and Japan, and it connected seamlessly without me having to fiddle with settings.
2. **Security**: Public WiFi networks are a hacker‚Äôs paradise. Ryoko creates a private, **WPA2-encrypted WiFi network**, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about my data being stolen.
3. **Compact Design**: It‚Äôs small enough to fit in your pocket, which makes it perfect for travel.

If you‚Äôre curious, you can see more details about Ryoko‚Äôs coverage and features [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

# What Are the Downsides?

Of course, no device is perfect. Here are a few things I didn‚Äôt love about **Ryoko WiFi**:

1. **Initial Data Limit**: The included SIM card only comes with **500MB of data**, which is fine for testing but not much else. You‚Äôll need to top up quickly.
2. **No Display Screen**: It doesn‚Äôt have a screen to show data usage or signal strength. You have to check these through an app or browser, which can be a little inconvenient.
3. **Color Options**: This is minor, but the device is only available in white. I‚Äôd love a black or gray option.

# How Does It Compare to Other Options?

You might be wondering how **Ryoko WiFi** stacks up against using your phone‚Äôs hotspot or other portable WiFi devices. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found:

* **Battery Life**: Ryoko lasts much longer than a phone hotspot. While my phone drains in 3-4 hours when tethering, Ryoko runs for up to 15 hours.
* **Cost Efficiency**: International roaming fees add up quickly. With **Ryoko portable WiFi**, I can avoid those entirely.
* **Stability**: The connection is more stable than my phone‚Äôs hotspot, especially when connecting multiple devices.

# Who Should Use MUAMA Ryoko WiFi?

In my opinion, **Ryoko WiFi** is perfect for:

* **Travelers**: If you‚Äôre exploring different countries, this device is a lifesaver.
* **Remote Workers**: Reliable internet for Zoom calls and online work, even in remote areas.
* **Families**: With support for multiple devices, everyone can stay connected.
* **Students**: Great for studying at coffee shops or campuses with unreliable public WiFi.

# Final Thoughts: Is Ryoko Portable WiFi Worth It?

After months of using the **MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi**, I can confidently say it‚Äôs been a great addition to my tech setup. It‚Äôs not perfect, but the benefits far outweigh the downsides.

The **global coverage**, **long battery life**, and **secure connection** make it ideal for anyone who needs reliable internet on the go. Whether you‚Äôre working remotely, traveling abroad, or just want a better alternative to public WiFi, **Ryoko WiFi** is worth considering.
