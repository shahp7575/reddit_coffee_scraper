( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I've been working from home lately, and like many of you, I've struggled with keeping my coffee hot while juggling work tasks. After trying various solutions, I finally found the perfect mug warmer that doesn't take up too much space on my cramped desk.

I know the frustration of reaching for your coffee only to find it cold – especially during those long Zoom meetings. After extensive research and testing different products, I discovered this amazing compact mug warmer that's been a game-changer for my daily routine: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

What I love most about this particular model is its minimal footprint. At just 4.3 inches in diameter, it fits perfectly even on my small corner desk without interfering with my mouse pad or keyboard. The sleek design doesn't look bulky or out of place among my other desk accessories.

Here's what really sets it apart:
- Temperature control options
- Auto shut-off feature (safety first!)
- Compatible with most standard mugs
- Non-slip base
- Waterproof surface

I've tried those oversized warmers before, and they were just impractical for small spaces. Some of them were so big they practically needed their own desk! But this one hits the sweet spot between functionality and size.

For those wondering about power consumption – it's surprisingly efficient. I keep mine plugged in all day, and it barely affects my electricity bill. The heating element maintains a consistent temperature without overheating your beverage, which is crucial for both taste and safety.

Pro tip: If you're considering getting one (which I highly recommend), make sure your favorite mug has a flat bottom for optimal heat transfer. I learned this the hard way with my curved-bottom mug!

I've actually gotten so much use out of mine that I bought another one for my partner. If you're interested in checking it out, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

I honestly can't imagine my workspace without it now. It's perfect for anyone with limited desk space who still wants to enjoy hot beverages throughout the day. Whether you're a coffee enthusiast, tea lover, or hot chocolate fan, this compact warmer is a total desk essential.

Let me know if you have any questions about size specifications or compatibility with different mug types. I'd be happy to help based on my experience!",1,1759493873.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I'm in mid 30s, but people see my that I'm in my late 20s. So, would like to share my routine for skincare routine with you. When it comes to skincare, I really believe the basics matter the most: Sleep well and eat healthy food → your skin always reflects your lifestyle. Then comes skincare products. They’re important, but they work best *on top of* good habits.

That said, I’ve tried a lot of products and thought I’d share my quick ratings + impressions:

1. **Banobagi Ampoule (6/10)** Hydrating, decent moisture, but not super impressive. I’d personally move on to something else.
2. **Mediheal Hyaluronic Mask (8/10)** Affordable and surprisingly nice. After using it, my makeup looked more glowy. Mediheal has variety of different types of masks, but not sure about the “anti-aging” claims — feels more like a hydration boost.
3. **Innisfree Retinol PDRN Ampoule (9/10)** My skin usually hates retinol — always breaks out, even with tiny amounts. But this one? No irritation at all. It uses a vegan PDRN derived from green tea, which seems to cushion the irritation. Skin felt smoother the next morning. Price is reasonable too.
4. **d’Alba Tone-up Sunscreen (9/10)** Sunscreen = absolute must. This one brightens with a pink base but doesn’t leave a chalky white cast. Doubles as a makeup base, so on no-makeup days I skip foundation and just use this. Texture is really comfortable.
5. **Dr.G Moisture Cream (9/10)** Very well-known as a calming moisturizer. Daily use with zero breakouts, affordable, and simply reliable. (Funny enough, I don’t love their sunscreen — stings my eyes — but the cream is excellent.)
6. **Not a product, but a tip** → Gua sha before bed. I gently massage along my neck, jawline, and behind my ears. It boosts circulation and makes my face look healthier in the morning.
7. **And of course: water!** Coffee doesn’t count! I used to drink only coffee/cola all day. Recently I cut coffee for a week and focused on water — the inner hydration feels *so different*. Not exaggerating, it really shows on my skin.

I am actually sick but I could work through it, I would just be very uncomfortable. 

So on Monday the company wide owner of our function emailed my skip boss and said he wanted an accounting of all our broken inventory as well as a projection of what won't sell and what site should own the charges by the end of today.  It's a huge undertaking, very political, and cross-functional. 

So I immediately set up a 10 minute meeting with my boss and skip boss to discuss the request. They declined. I messaged my skip boss for some times he could meet. He left me on read despite showing available. That afternoon after already losing half a day on a request that usually takes an entire month to prepare I sent an email to the stake holders suggesting a narrower than normal focus and asking their thoughts. Nobody fucking responded. 

I went ahead with some work on my own but it's pretty minimal compared to what it should be given who asked for it. I finally got skip boss on slack and he said he was too busy all week to meet until Friday. Then yesterday I went out and saw he was fucking grilling hot dogs at the fall player festival. Too busy to meet? Are you serious!? 

This morning it feels like a football is in my lower intestine and I'd like to just lounge and drink water. I'm dehydrated from work, too much coffee not enough water and not enough breaks. I don't want to deal with this massive problem that my bosses incompetence caused.

I’m a 40-year-old woman who’s looking to meet new people and break out of the usual routine. I’ve realized that life feels a lot more fun when you’re surrounded by good energy and interesting conversations.

A little about me:

* I love traveling (even if it’s just exploring hidden spots in my own city).
* Coffee and good books are basically my love language.
* I have a playful sense of humor, but I also enjoy deeper chats about life, goals, and everything in between.
* Big fan of people who are curious, kind, and not afraid to be a little silly.

If you’re looking for someone who’s down-to-earth but still curious about new experiences, let’s talk. Surprise me with your favorite story, a random question, or even a “would you rather” — I’m up for it.

As a long-time pet owner and someone who's struggled with allergies, I wanted to share my experience with air purifiers and whether they're actually worth the investment, especially if you've got furry friends at home.

I've had two cats and a German Shepherd for years, and let me tell you, the amount of pet dander and fur floating around was driving me crazy. My allergies were acting up, and I could literally see the fur particles dancing in the sunlight coming through my windows. Not exactly the most pleasant sight when you're trying to enjoy your morning coffee, right?

After doing tons of research and testing different solutions, I finally decided to give air purifiers a shot. I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/air-purifier, and honestly, it's been a game-changer for my home's air quality.

Here's what I've noticed since using an air purifier:

1. Way less visible pet hair floating around
2. Reduced pet odors (especially that distinct ""dog smell"" after rainy walks)
3. Significantly fewer allergy symptoms
4. Less dust on furniture
5. Better sleep (probably due to cleaner air)

But let's be real - they're not magic machines. You still need to vacuum regularly and keep up with basic cleaning. Think of an air purifier as part of your overall cleaning strategy, not a replacement for it.

What really surprised me was how it helped with cooking odors too. You know when you cook fish or fry something, and the smell lingers forever? Yeah, that's much less of an issue now.

For those of you considering getting one, here are some pro tips I've learned:

- Place it in rooms where your pets spend the most time
- Get one with a true HEPA filter
- Make sure it's appropriately sized for your room
- Clean/replace filters as recommended
- Run it 24/7 on lower settings instead of occasionally on high

The initial cost might seem high, but when you factor in better health, less cleaning time, and improved air quality, it's totally worth it. I got mine from https://athometouch.com/air-purifier after comparing different models, and the difference in my home's air quality has been night and day.

For my fellow pet parents dealing with allergies or just tired of breathing in fur and dander, I'd definitely recommend giving an air purifier a try. It's one of those purchases that you don't realize how much you needed until you actually have it.

Anyone else using air purifiers with pets? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",1,1759493366.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

I literally just finished the quest “Inner Demons” and god damn this quest should’ve been a requirement regardless if you saved Treviso or not. 

Every playthrough, I save Minrathous and because of that, I always think of Lucanis as an abomination who likes coffee and is a meh character. I always roll my eyes at the ending where Illario lives. But now I get it.

I love the fact we get to explore more of the surviving of trauma, of the feelings of guilt and knowing that no matter what, you’re stuck with that trauma and you have to live with it. Lucanis has to live with it. I get it now. I understand why Lucanis doesn’t want to kill Illario and why we can’t kill Illario (even if I don’t like it). 

But also, I hate the fact that Rook gets to tell Lucanis “oh I get it now” instead of the devs letting us figure it out for ourselves. We should’ve been the ones to come to this conclusion rather than letting Rook be the mouthpiece for what the devs want.

Lysandra's heels clicked against the asphalt as she left the gymnasium with her tablet snugly tucked under her arm. The federal liaisons and agency personnel trailing behind her were already dispersing to handle their own duties as Lysandra headed toward the parked convoy. Although Lysandra was an extremely exotic oddity, at this moment, she was just another part of the massive machine operating under an executive mandate.

The high school they had occupied was now fully converted into a federal processing center. What used to be a parking lot for teachers' beaters and teenagers' first cars was now filled with black vehicles—sedans, SUVs, and heavily armored SWAT Bearcats displaying the insignias of numerous three-letter agencies. FBI and HSI agents, wearing ballistic plates, gathered in small groups, some reviewing operations and procedures, while others coordinated on radios. But regardless of what any agent was doing, they didn't even glance at Lysandra as she confidently moved through the crowd.

Whatever novelty once existed in working with an honest-to-god Elf had completely worn off, especially when the hunt started and they all had to get into gear. Everyone had a role to play, and there was a mandate from the American people to get this new security crisis under control.

Flatbed trucks rolled into the makeshift compound, hauling in temporary structures. Housing units, mobile command centers, medical screening units, and what looked suspiciously like holding cells were being set up outside, where football and baseball fields were located. The entire operation had the controlled chaos of a well-oiled machine, with each component focused on its specific task.

Lysandra marched toward a blacked-out GMC Suburban with an expression that grew more irritated with each step. As she approached, she found a group of agents huddled near the vehicle, deep in discussion over a phone showing what appeared to be a map with various red markers.

""—Last sighting was three days ago in Knoxville,"" one was saying. ""If the pattern holds, they're moving East.""

""Could be trying for the state line,"" another added. ""We should coordinate with the Tennessee Highway Patrol.""

As Lysandra reached for the door handle, she finally voiced her frustration, muttering under her breath. ""How does anyone tolerate this garbage?"" She sat down after flinging the door open and lifted one foot to glare at the offending heel. ""Three inches of torture disguised as fashion. Being forced into this awful contraption in this world makes it somehow even more infuriating.""

One of the FBI agents—a woman in her forties with her hair in a practical bun—glanced over from her discussion. ""Rookie mistake,"" she said with an amused huff. ""Should've kept a pair of flats in your go-bag. Jason, didn't we tell her that on day one?""

The agent named Jason, still studying his phone, shrugged without lifting his eyes. ""We told her lots of things, Ashley.""

Ashley, the female agent, turned back to Lysandra with a look that was more assessment than sympathy. ""That's how it goes when the brass wants you at every dog and pony show. When the President has the full backing of the entire House and Senate, if he says jump, everyone asks how high.""

She then gestured at the circus around them with her coffee cup. ""Every local politician within five hundred miles wants their photo op with the elf who's hunting her own kind. Governors, mayors, hell, I think the Nashville city comptroller tried to get a meeting yesterday.""

""Tell me about it,"" Jason finally looked up with a sour expression. ""While you were inside doing your scary enforcer routine, I've been fielding calls from three different police chiefs who want to know why their departments aren't getting a bigger slice of the task force pie. As if we don't have enough egos to manage.""

A snort left Ashley’s mouth as she took a swig of her coffee. ""At least the reframing is working. Six months ago, these were 'alien invaders.' Now they're just 'interdimensional fugitives' and 'persons of interest.' Makes our job easier when the public isn't screeching about an invasion every five minutes.""

""The CIA’s spin game is solid, I'll give you that,"" Jason added, rolling his shoulder and glancing at Lysandra tossing her heels in the back of the SUV. ""Though I still think 'Former Knight Hunts Magical Criminals' sounds like a bad TV show pitch.""

Lysandra yanked open the Suburban's door, tossing her tablet onto the seat. ""Is there a point to this commentary, or do you two just enjoy the sound of your own voices?""

""Just saying,"" Ashley replied with a mischievous cackle when she heard Lysandra's tone, ""next stop is Atlanta. City council presentation at two, Governor at four. Maybe invest in some gel insoles.""

Or tell them to fuck off and send a video conference, Jason said with his own annoying smirk as he added to the conversation. ""We've got actual fugitives to catch. Speaking of which, Ramirez wants you to review the Atlanta files when you get a chance. That goblin crew hit another jewelry store.""

A groan that was audible even over the rumble of nearby vehicles starting up echoed out as Lysandra dipped her head. ""Same shit, different realm."" She grumbled that strange Earthling proverb while still massaging her aching foot.

That set Jason and Ashley off like hyenas, their laughter echoing across the parking lot. ""Look at that, she's going native!"" Jason crowed, elbowing Ashley. ""Just under a year and she's already picking up our colorful expressions.""

""Next thing you know, she'll be eating hot dogs at baseball games,"" Ashley added with an insufferable grin. ""Though I gotta say, goblin robbery crews are definitely new to us. Never thought I'd be reading that the 'suspect is three feet tall, green, and likes shiny things' in an official report.""

Lysandra scoffed, shifting to massage her other foot. ""Please, nabbing shiny trinkets is a Kobold thing. Plus, hunting down idiots this overt is easy. When I was a Knight, I was tasked with tracking the nastiest pieces of trash to ever exist.""

She leaned back in the leather seat, her expression becoming distant. ""House Ithyca specifically retained me to hunt those Freelancers or even bounty hunters refused to touch. Serial killers who used blood magic, trafficking rings that dealt in more than just bodies, and freelancer groups that turned to organized crime.""

""It was one thing to run jobs for a syndicate, and something else entirely when all the children in a village disappeared. Plus, I had to deal with the underworld going too far and putting hits out on high-profile merchants or even nobles."" Lysandra sighed as she reached for her boots in the back.

The federal agents looked at Lysandra with a hint of interest. Those from the notorious agency the elf woman was from rarely shared anything about their personal lives or past. But then again, Lysandra wasn’t your typical spook, and she wasn’t even from this planet, so the agents were even more keen on listening.

""Well, here you have fancy tools like cameras,"" Jason said, his tone somewhere between mocking and impressed. ""Must be like cheating.""

The cameras help,"" Lysandra admitted. ""Though half of these fools who get caught up in doing something this stupid probably didn’t take the time to learn what they even are. That goblin crew in Atlanta? They probably thought the cameras were decorative.

But as she thought more on the criminal elements that snuck into this world, Lysandra’s expression darkened and the levity drained from her voice. ""There are problem individuals still at large, though. Smart ones. They won't surface again unless they want to, and when they do...""

She trailed off, but both agents caught the implication.

""How bad are we talking?"" Ashley asked, her professional instincts kicking in.

There's a Warlock named Matthias Korren who specializes in shapeshifting—devil magic that allows him to take any form and mimic any voice. Last I heard, he was hired with other freelancers in the expeditionary force."" Lysandra's jaw tightened. ""Then there's Verra, a psychotic, disgusting demon of a person that needs to be purged with fire. Looks like an innocent petite woman, but she's got a body count higher than there are people in a town. Poisons, curses, ritual magic. She likes to play with her food.""

""Jesus,"" Jason muttered.

""And those are just the ones I know by name,"" Lysandra continued. ""The really smart ones? They're probably already embedded. New identities, quiet lives, waiting. Maybe they'll stay that way forever, or maybe one day they'll decide they're tired of hiding.""

She looked directly at both agents. ""Your world has organized crime, yes? Now imagine what someone with Blood Magic or Devil Magic could do if they got connected with the right—or wrong—people. Protection rackets backed by actual curses. Assassination via ritual magic that leaves no physical evidence. Drug operations enhanced by sorcery. You’ll need your own Warlocks and Witches to even fight against it.""

""And since you’re just a loaner, you won't be on this task force forever,"" Ashley said slowly, narrowing her eyes.

""Indeed."" Lysandra pulled her heels back on with a grimace. ""I’m only here long enough to kick-start your investigations as a specialist. After that, I’ll go back to... whatever they decide I'm useful for. And you'll be left trying to hunt these animals with conventional methods.""

The two agents simply stood there with frustrated looks, knowing this was far from ideal. Several agents had stopped whatever they were doing and started discreetly listening in on the conversation. Everyone around seemed to share Ashley and Jason's unease when Lysandra mentioned these... things'... abilities. This was far beyond the norm for any Federal agent, but they were the first and last line of defense against these monsters.

""Well, fuck,"" Jason said succinctly, running a hand through his hair. ""So what the hell do we do about them then?""

Lysandra shrugged, a gesture that somehow managed to evoke a wave of absolute dread. ""You keep doing what we're doing now. Try to recruit talent that will enable you to counter these threats. Hopefully, you'll stumble across a witch or warlock willing to work with you."" She explained, pulling out her phone and glancing at her messages. ""And hope the monsters let loose among the sheep make a mistake.""

She then glanced out the door toward the organized chaos of the processing center. ""Hell, maybe they'll take our offer and work for us directly instead of needing us to hunt them down,"" Lysandra added with a tone that made it clear she didn't believe that herself. ""The really dangerous bastards… Everyone like Matthias and Verra, aren’t exactly the type to take the offer, to be honest. They’re predators who found themselves in a world full of prey that didn't even know magic existed a little under a year ago.""

""That's not exactly reassuring,"" Ashley said dryly.

""It wasn't meant to be,"" Lysandra replied. ""Reality rarely is.""

An agent listening from a nearby vehicle pondered the implications of the criminal underground being able to shape-shift. And from how Lysandra explained things, it sounded like this piece of shit could change genders and voices. Dealing with something like that would be the absolute worst-case scenario.

It was one thing for a vile serial killer to be capable of such a feat, but the nightmares that would spawn if organized crime or, God forbid, a terrorist organization could do the same… it would be catastrophic. Then there was the absolute nightmare of adversarial nation-states or non-state actors setting up shop and training agents en masse. The problems that would arise would be insurmountable.

""Speaking of predators,"" The Agent listening in sighed, wanting not to think about that nightmare of a scenario, and suddenly spoke up.  ""What's your take on those smaller furred and scaled fuckers running around?"" He waved his hand dismissively. ""You know, the ones that have been burrowing and skulking about in alleyways and drainage systems or whatever.""He leaned against the open SUV door after walking up. ""How hard will it be to get rid of ‘em?""

Lysandra fixed the man with a strange look and tilted her head slightly off to the side in thought. ""Are you talking about the Kobolds and Scroungers that made their way here?""

The agent snapped his fingers and pointed at her as if she'd just answered a game show question correctly. ""Yep! Those are the ones.""

A dark laugh escaped Lysandra's throat, the sound making several agents shift uncomfortably. ""Ha! Ya, you're not getting rid of those goddess damned things."" She answered, invoking her new deity’s name.

Pure exasperation was plastered all over Lysandras face as she shook her head. It was an expression that suggested this was a struggle that even her world was unable to deal with. ""They populate faster than those wild swine you call hogs, and they can survive on eating literal garbage. In my world, we tried everything to exterminate those vile  things."" She said pointing a scolding finger at the agent. ""Not to reduce the population, not to move them, exterminate! We had kill on sight bounties for Freelancers, merchant guards or even hunters!""

Any idiot with something sharp and pointy could have collected money, even the local village hunter,” Lysandra continued, as if she was genuinely upset. ""We’ve tried everything! Hell, the Empire brought over specialized mages, the ones specialized in Necromancy, to create a plague just for them, and it didn’t even make a dent—only left festering, tainted corpses everywhere! Nothing worked!""

""You're kidding,"" Ashley said flatly.

Pure, unfettered hatred flashed across Lysandra’s face. ""I wish I was."" She growled, rubbing her temple as if the mere thought gave her a splitting headache. ""No matter what you try, you're not getting rid of them. Kobolds are too smart, and Scroungers adapt to everything—damn it, they even survive in deserts, active volcanoes, at the bottom of frozen lakes—hell, in the plagued lands! They're like cockroaches, but worse in every way.""

""So what the hell do we do?"" the agent asked, looking increasingly disturbed.

""The best you can do is try to somehow enlist the Kobolds to work for you,"" Lysandra said, though her tone suggested she knew how absurd that sounded. ""They're... reasonably intelligent. Chaotic, yes. An absolute mess of a species, certainly. But they can be bargained with.""

She adjusted her seatbelt, preparing for the drive. ""House Ithyca actually had a contract with several Kobold warrens before we were purged. They handled waste management, minor construction, pest control—jobs no one else wanted. It worked... mostly.""

""Mostly?"" Jason prompted.

A difficult look formed on Lysandra’s face as she waved her hand dismissively. ""Well, they also had a habit of 'collecting' anything and everything that wasn't nailed down, starting territorial wars with each other in the alleys or culverts, and occasionally eating someone's pet."" She grimaced. ""But it was better than having them as active enemies. When the house fell and the contracts ended...""

She didn't need to finish. The agents could imagine what happened when suddenly unemployed Kobolds were left to their own devices.

""Even if you manage to integrate some of them,"" Lysandra continued, ""there will always be rogue bands or entire warrens that need culling. They're too fractious as a species to ever fully unify. You'll be dealing with Kobold problems for as long as your world exists.""

""And the Scroungers?"" someone called out.

""Pray the Kobolds' hatred of them puts them back on a warpath. They’re the only ones good at and dedicated enough to hunt down and destroy them,"" Lysandra said seriously. ""If they haven’t already, the moment they decide humans are easier prey than dumpster diving, you'll have a real problem. They're not intelligent like Kobolds—they're just hungry, adaptable, and they breed like nothing you've ever seen.""

The assembled agents looked at each other with expressions ranging from disbelief to horror.

So we've got intelligent, bipedal lizards and magical, flesh-eating plague rats that both reproduce faster than we can kill them,"" Jason summarized.

A huff of amusement escaped Lysandra's mouth as she shot her gaze toward Jason. ""Don’t forget that they can use tools, set traps, coordinate, and live in the most austere environments possible,"" Lysandra added. ""Don't underestimate these things just because they're small. A Kobold Clan with a grudge and knowledge of your infrastructure could cause more damage than any serial killer warlock could ever hope.""

""I really think I need a drink,"" Ashley muttered, pinching the bridge of her nose. ""Or to resign…”

The Elf couldn't help but offer a sinister smile. She truly enjoys seeing pure misery on the agents' faces. The taste of shared suffering is sweet to her because she felt the same when she first started her role as a knight and was given the lowest-level task of eliminating these creatures, or more accurately, population control.

It had been a horrible assignment that followed her even into her freelance life after House Ithyca fell. Exterminating Scroungers and destroying rogue Kobold warrens wasn't a task she had ever imagined would chase her across dimensions into this world…. Yet here she was. Now Lysandraw was, in a completely different realm, only to face the same damned kleptomaniac pests and diseased vermin.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

At least, hopefully, she could pass the buck of this shit detail to someone else. Let these Earthlings discover the joy of crawling through drainage systems after creatures that thrived on drinking sewage.

Lysandra slipped the back of her heel onto her foot properly and ran a hand through her hair before letting out a heavy sigh. ""Alright, let's go meet this council and governor or whatever."" She settled back into the leather seat, already dreading the next several hours. ""The faster we get these meetings over with, the faster I can get back to hunting down Verra or, Goddess help me, Matthias.""

She pulled her feet fully into the SUV and arranged herself in the backseat before slamming the door shut. The thought of tracking actual dangerous criminals instead of playing politics was almost appealing, even if said criminals could literally curse her into oblivion.

The agents around the vehicles let out heavy sighs as the weight of their new reality settled on their shoulders like lead blankets. They pushed themselves up from their various resting positions against car doors, hoods, or bumpers and started trudging to their own vehicles.

""Guess that's our cue,"" Jason muttered, tossing his now-cold coffee into a nearby trash can.

""Just another day in post-rift America,"" Ashley replied, her tone indicating she had come to terms with their new reality.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1nwx2hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1nwx2hw/some_positive_news/,Some positive news !! 🌻,"So I've been balls deep in psychosis for six months and halle-freaking-lujah I have some fantastic news !

I was on 600mg amisulpride, 150mg pregabalin and 10mg diazepam 

Shrinks were running back and forth like headless chooms having me go from hospitals to rushing appointments to constant ED presentations

And finally, I mean freaking finally there's been a breakthrough 

They've changed my meds to 400mg amisulpride (they had to reduce because of akathisia, shrinks are real nice about not putting me on the depot or forcing meds because I'm compliant nowadays), 225mg pregabalin, tapered down to 5mg diazepam 

I don't know *exactly* what's bringing me out of psychosis 

But my hallucinations are finally stopping! 

I used to pray to see Earth look like normal and well uh I'm not exactly religious anymore but anyway I just thought that was a sad prayer, my vision isn't blacking out and flashing with cartoons and monstrosities every three seconds anymore 

I finally feel almost like... Like pre-schizophrenia Jade! Still moody as heck but I'm reconnecting with old friends and FINALLY my hallucinations are stopping 

I'll be honest with you guys. I seriously thought I was perma fried and going to be psychotic for the rest of my life. 

These past few months have been hands down the worst of my entire life. I mean at least I mostly wasn't suicidal/homicidal? But yeeeeesh I don't really remember too well but I'm told I thought I was doing telepathy with aliens and ""needed to escape Earth"" at some point I called cops and I cringe sooo hard remembering the convo. They said they were going to take me in for false allegations and I was flabberghasted I tell you, then I think they realised I was just off with the fairies and called my MH care team on me. My memories are pretty much just staring out a window talking to imaginary characters in my head for like two months and starving myself because my food always looked like it was tampered with or things like lots of spiders crawling into my coffee. This was all greatly exacerbated by my best friend dying, I think that's partially why it's taken so freaking long to come out of it. 

I'm finally back at a healthy weight. I thought the hallucinations would never stop, and tonight's the night guys! Our cozy little planet is looking normal and I'm feeling like my personality and mind are coming back.

🙂 My tae-kwon-do instructor used to say ""ain't nothing to it but to do it!"" So don't give up hope if you have chronic psychosis 🫶 

It's super strange a *reduction* in my antipsychotics and an increase in pregabalin has instigated such positive change but I'm all here for it!

Edit: oh the cops isn't even the most embarassing thing by the way 😒🤨 I literally called my country's intelligence agency and the guy that answered was super sweet and patient about it but I'm still dying inside cringing thinking about. I just l, awwwwh man psychosis is shit. I have tons more stories I might share as they come back to me but it's been a SHIT six months",1,1759492589.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False

1nwx2bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nwx2bz/a_male_friend_got_mad_at_me_because_a_guy_was/,A male friend got mad at me because a guy was hitting on me and I was interested in him too,"I (24F) went to a college seminar with a male friend (25M). We are applying to grad schools together and were keeping each other in check on our college application process. During the seminar, I asked a couple questions (partly because I wanted an answer and partly because I wanted to kinda leave a mark since a lot of people on the panel were admissions officers of the colleges I was interested in). Not trying to toot my own horn, but I could tell the admissions officers were (slightly) impressed (?) by the question I had asked. After this, my friend also wanted to ask a question, so I decided to help him out by acquiring the mic for him. After a couple failed attempts, he seemed to get really (visibly) annoyed by me doing so, which left me confused but then I shrugged it away not thinking of it much.

After the seminar ended, there was a more informal high-tea situation with the members of the panel where you could directly approach each member and ask them questions. My friend and I were standing in line to grab a cup of coffee when a guy approached me asking if I was the girl who had asked the question I had asked. The guy and I then chatted for a bit (while my friend was there) and we realised that we both went to the same college for undergrad. I could tell this guy was hitting on me or was interested, so I continued chatting with him while my friend left us alone to go network with the others. After we were both done with our respective networkings, we reconvened and decided to leave and go get lunch which is when the guy who was hitting on me, came back and asked me for my socials. Since I was interested too, I very gladly exchanged them and left. This was when my friend got really mad and had an outburst towards me, calling me ""too much"" and ""too hyper"". I was confused and didnt even have the energy to protest back or say anything so I just let him go on his ramble. He then continued and said ""I didnt like that guy at all, he didnt even acknowledge me"". This confused me, because was the guy supposed to acknowledge you? It was very clear why he had approached us. Also the conversation was a couple minutes long and he only spoke to me because we were connecting on our shared alma mater. That guy was definitely not rude. At this point I was genuinely confused. I was wondering how could I be so blind that I didnt notice/observe something that he must have done that offended my friend. So I asked my friend what exactly did he do, to which my friend responded and said ""I dont want to speak on this anymore since if I do it will sound like I am jealous."" I was honestly tired at this point and decided not to probe anymore. My friend was so mad that he decided not to get lunch anymore since he didnt want me to see him in this state. I was hungry and I wanted to get lunch, so I asked him to pull over and switch seats. I told him that he could grab a cab back home and I could drive my car to the nearest McDonalds. He ignored me and continued driving and a few minutes later said ""yeah, I am a bit sensitive. let's go get lunch"".

This whole incident had left me really confused because he is already aware of my feelings for him. I have told him that I do like him but he keeps saying that he doesn't feel the same. I am not taking his lack of interest in me personally but then why act like such a child when I find someone that I am interested in? He even proceeded to say that the guy didnt have good intentions for me. That statement made me wanna throw up, because why are we assuming I want good intentions?

1. Talking to women in bars, nightclubs, coffee shops, walking around during the day etc. I'd love to have the confidence to walk over, introduce myself, have a fun conversation and ask for the number, but that's not currently possible for someone like myself.

2. Not speaking up when in a group, so I end up following my friends around, when I often have better ideas in mind. I've had a lot of bad nights because of this.

3. My boss will sometimes ask if I'd like something to eat (the job requires a LOT of driving). I'll sometimes say yes, but often say no as I don't have the balls to accept his offer.

4. I play pool on Thursday nights. Most people play 2 because they ask, but I don't so I only play 1.

It's not the biggest example, but it's proof that I need to improve confidence. 

5. While at work, I'll have my two bosses asking me to perform different tasks. Instead of calming saying that I'm currently busy, I'll quickly swap what I'm doing, which often results in two jobs not being done correctly.

There's a few more examples, but you already get the point. I want to change but my low self-esteem always prevents me.

Hey, fellow content creators and side hustlers! 👋

So, let’s dive into something that’s been on my mind lately—a little secret I’ve discovered along the growth journey. What if I told you that you could rack up those sweet gains without putting your pretty face on every video, post, or tweet? Yep, we're talking about faceless growth strategies that are actually making waves right now. You ready? Let’s go!

Imagine this: you’re chilling with a nice cup of coffee, scrolling through your bank account, and realizing that your faceless content machine is doing all the heavy lifting while you sit back and relax. Sounds dreamy, right? 😌

Here’s **how you can do it**:

1. **Automate Your Content**  
   There are so many tools available now to help you streamline your content creation process. I mean, why spend hours on something you can automate? Tools like **DS24**—seriously, check it out [here](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)—can help you maximize earnings while you kick back.

2. **Niche Down**  
   Instead of creating content about everything under the sun, find a niche that speaks to you. This not only makes it easier to produce content but builds a dedicated audience. Have you ever found yourself deep in a niche community? It's pretty wild how invested people get!

3. **Leverage AI**  
   Ever heard of AI copywriting tools? They can help you whip up captions, blog posts, or even email newsletters faster than you can say “content strategy!” Just think about all the time you’ll save. Plus, who doesn’t love to let a robot do the heavy lifting, right? 🤖

4. **Affiliate Marketing**  
   Not using affiliate links in your faceless content? You’re seriously missing out! Promoting products without showing your face could open up a whole new revenue stream. Get creative! Find products you truly believe in, and share them in your blogs or social posts. Remember to keep it real and not just chase the commission.

5. **Utilize Stock Assets**  
   Stock photos, videos, and graphics can spice up your content without you being in front of the camera. Feel like a stealth ninja creating content from behind the scenes! 🎨🖥️

The real kicker? Many of these strategies are still under the radar. That means LESS competition and a goldmine of opportunities. It’s like hitting the lottery before everyone else catches on.

Now, I won’t sit here pretending it’s all rainbows and sparkles. Growing a faceless brand does require grit and hustle. But let me tell you, once you find your rhythm, it’s a game changer. 

So, what about you? Have you tried any faceless growth strategies that have worked wonders? Or maybe you’ve been thinking about diving in but just haven’t taken the leap yet? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

New lab results,"I have had symptoms since 13F and I am now 22F. I am 130 lbs and 5ft 3in. My mom’s side of the family has a history of thyroid problems in the women, 2 out of 5 have hypo, 1 has hyper and the others are unknown. They have all had to have surgery and cut out either half or all of their thyroid gland.

My symptoms that have been consistent for 9+ years (since 13) are: -Cold hands and feet -Lower belly fat that will not go away -Fluid in fingers, ankles, toes -“Puffy” everywhere, face, body, everywhere -Very low energy -difficulty making decisions

What has progressed since I was 13 has been: -Difficulty concentrating, focusing, memory loss that is getting worse etc. -Depression that is getting worse. By depression, I mean major depression confirmed by a therapist. The kind of depression that has made me feel numb to everything including things I used to enjoy.

As of 1 year ago now, since I changed my diet from the typical American diet (Ultra processed foods, coffee, sugar, simple carbs like bread etc.) to a whole foods diet (grass-fed meats, butter, organic fruits/veggies etc.), I have had irregular periods. I have gone over 5 months without a period. Before I switched my diet away from ultra processed foods, I was having regular cycles. My physique has stayed relatively the same since I was 13, just a little overall more fat distributed the same way all over my body.

This year, I have been to the doctor a lot because I am sick of living this way, having little energy, not enjoying life and just being depressed. So I changed my diet, in hopes that that would give me energy and make me lose the belly fat. My energy levels have not changed at all since I was 13. My change of diet hasn’t changed anything, I have the same lower belly fat and no increase in energy.

For lifestyle, I have always gotten 7-8+ hours of sleep each night no problem, since the diet change I only drink water and kefir- no more coffee, I have never drank or smoked or done any drugs or birth control, I do not take any meds, I do not have major stressors in my life, my life is safe. I try to strength train 3x a week.

Here are the lab results that I have gotten:

9/6/25 Lab results notes (I copy and pasted them): Your recent lab results indicate that your Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Antibodies level is elevated at 177 IU/mL, exceeding the normal range of 0 to 34 IU/mL. Additionally, your insulin level is high at 40.7, above the normal range of 2.6 to 24.9, and your C-Peptide level is also elevated at 4.8, surpassing the normal range of 1.1 to 4.4. Albumin is slightly high at 5.1 g/dL. Your glucose level is low at 55 mg/dL, and your creatinine level is slightly high at 1.08 mg/dL. Furthermore, your vitamin D level is low at 26.4 ng/mL. In contrast, your thyroid function tests show that your TSH level is 1.27 and Free T4 level is 1.28, both within normal ranges. Your Free Triiodothyronine (T3) level is also normal at 2.9 pg/mL. Lastly, your complete blood count results, including white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, are all within normal ranges, indicating overall good blood health. Your morning cortisol level is within the normal range at 9.2 (ug/dL).",1,1759491891.0,InsulinResistance,0,1.0,False

I haven’t had a ton of relationships, but every girl I’ve dated long term has been “better looking” than  my equivalent self. I’m like a 6 dating 7-8s. 

I was in a 10 month relationship that ended in April. She wanted to move in together by summer and and get married  by winter. We had some differences but never fought and had great times. Then one day she said we need to talk and broke up with me. I was crushed started dating right away to get her off my mind (she knew about it) I asked her to reconsider several times , and she kept saying our journey was over.

It’s been 5 months, we’ve texted maybe 1x a month since the breakup and met once to give eachother our stuff back, and once more where she needed my help. After her last rejection  i finally said fine, deleted her social media, her #, and told her I deleted all our messages/photos together.

I’m now in a new relationship, almost 2 months in, with a girl who treats me very well. Compliments me, cooks for us, doesn’t expect me to pay for everything, we’re very much 50-50 on many things. I can tell she’s fallen for me , tells me she loves being with me, loves waking up next to me, etc. She’s a lawyer, and makes a very good living. We’d basically be A power couple living an excellent life if we last. 

My ex reached out a couple days ago with this message,(at this time of year it’s common in our culture to reach out and apologize to anyone you may have hurt).


Dear “Bob”, 
I want to apologize if I offended you unintentionally,
thank you for all our good times together,
and wish you a Happy New Year
 with all my heart 🫶🏻


My reply
“All good. I’ve moved on and am happy. Happy new year. Ah, and I have your bathing suit. Might be hard to coordinate during the  holidays. You don’t have to meet me if you prefer not to. I Can put it in a bag and hang on your door when I’m free if you prefer that”

Her reply 
“Thanks. I don't mind meeting for coffee i just don't know my schedule yet...”

Which I said ok we’ll figure it out. 

I still have feelings for her, she’s better looking than my current partner, and I feel like we ended for no reason. Out of the blue without trying to work out the differences.

I’m starting to have feelings for my new girlfriend even though she’s not typically the type I’d date looks wise. I feel like she’s done all the right things for a partner.

What should I do? 
Should I not meet my ex? What if she asks to try to get back together?
In my eyes we never should have broken up, and thought I made her as happy as she made me.",3,1759491618.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

I said “if someone is calling to me, be blunt, I am not good with signs.” I went to a metaphysical shop at the start of this and a book fell off the wall about working with ancestors. I didn’t have cash on me at the time and regret not getting it, since that was in the reels and my dreams. 

This morning I stopped and got a coffee. A vanilla drink with vanilla protein cold foam. The barista put banana cold foam on my drink instead. She didn’t tell me, but she was cracking up when I picked my drink up off the counter. My not an ex, ex HATES bananas. 

Alright, Lilith. I hear you. 

Where would I start? Am I crazy? 🤪 I mean I know the algorithm can mess up, but 28 different creator videos on the same topic in a row is wild. I’m not the kind of person that is petty or gets back at people, so I don’t wish harm on my ex, so I’m hesitant to reach out to Lilith as well.

1nwwlh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nwwlh8/tifu_when_i_shut_down_my_young_coworkers_advances/,TIFU when I shut down my young coworker's advances,"Alright, Reddit. This particular screw-up happened last night, and I’m currently at my desk feeling like I'm just waiting for a bomb to go off.

Look, I'm just a regular guy. 32 years old, married to a woman who's way out of my league, and our life is simple and good. I like it that way. I come to work, I do my job, I go home. The last thing I want or need is drama.

About a month ago, we hired a new girl, ""K"". She's 18, right out of school, and full of that bubbly energy I vaguely remember having. For some reason, she's decided I'm her target. At first I figured she was just friendly, but it's gotten to a point where I can't ignore it. It’s been things like:

1 - Finding little hearts drawn on my notepads if I leave them in the kitchen.

2 - The constant staring. I’ll be working and get that feeling someone's watching me, and sure enough, it's her. She just blushes when I look up.

3 - Some loudmouth in sales jokingly called her my ""work wife,"" and she just ran with it. Started signing notes to me with ""ww"". Just mortifying. 

4 - The real kicker was when I was talking with a buddy here about wanting kids with my wife, and K, who was pretending not to listen, chirps in with, ""I've always thought I'd make a great step-mom."" What do you even say to that?

My strategy, which in hindsight was pretty dumb, was to just be aggressively married. I'd bring my wife up constantly, hoping she’d get the message. ""My wife and I saw that movie,"" ""My wife packs my lunch,"" etc. I thought I was setting a clear boundary. I was not.

So, this brings us to the fuck-up last night.

It's late, and it's just the two of us left in the office finishing a project. The place is dead quiet. She brings me a coffee I didn't ask for and does that thing where her fingers linger on mine for way too long when she hands it to me. I pulled my hand away, and she gets this really serious look and asks, ""Are you really happy?""

And that was it. My patience, which I usually have a lot of, just hit zero. All the weeks of awkwardness and cringing just boiled over. I dropped the polite ""nice guy"" act and I was just... blunt. I looked her right in the eye and said, ""My wife is my world. That's not an appropriate question for work, and it's not up for discussion.""

I expected her to get embarrassed, maybe stammer an apology. But that's not what happened.

It was like I flipped a switch. The smile, the bubbly personality, all of it just vanished. Her face went completely blank. She just stared at me for a second, then said ""Okay"" in this flat, dead voice. The rest of the night was dead silent. It was the most uncomfortable hour of my entire career.

Today, it's like I'm sitting next to a stranger. A really angry stranger. She won't look at me, but the vibe is so hostile it's making my skin crawl. I'm no longer dealing with a kid with a crush; I'm dealing with a pissed-off woman I have to work with every single day. My big fuck-up was thinking that being direct would solve the problem. But I think I just made it a thousand times worse. Now I'm just sitting here, replaying it in my head, convinced she's going to march down to HR and claim *I* was the one hitting on her.

**TL;DR: A young coworker had a very obvious and inappropriate crush on me. I tried ignoring it and dropping hints, but last night I finally got blunt and shut her down. Now her personality has done a complete 180, she's giving me a hostile silent treatment, and I'm terrified I poked a bear and she's going to try and get me fired.**",235,1759491186.0,tifu,79,0.89,False

* Coffee Break French

I have no basic knowledge of French. I'm bilingual with fluency in English coming from learning it alongside my mother tongue- Bengali - from an early age.

What else could we do with the wall? The windows will be covered with floor-to-ceiling sheer flowy white curtains, and I am trying to convince my parents to get a black round wooden coffee table with vertical slats to sit right under the light fixture.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nwwk15,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1nwwk15/older_women_in_the_workplace/,Older women in the workplace,"Hi so i am 18 years old and i have been working at a diner for almost two years now. I always have had an issue with my manager (F30) because she talks to everyone else so differently than me. She rolls her eyes for just asking a question, mocks me, asks me “why do u look like that,” or other things about my appearance. She’s just plain rude to me and only me. 

Well one of our servers who has been here the longest is (F50) close with the manager. i always thought me and the older server had a very close relationship, i always considered her my work mom. she would always invite me over to her house, buy coffee creamer for me, etc. What hurts the most is she was there for me a lot of times i was going through stuff. 

However, about a week ago she snapped on me in front of everyone. This is how it went: it was 8 am we just opened and we were super slow, i came in about an hour after the openers and i did a  walkthrough to see if there was anything that needed to be done. We work in a small restaurant with only 22 tables and we have been so slow all we do is stock. Keep in mind I closed the day before and had to stock everything before i left. So after i realize there is nothing to do but wait for a table, me and my other coworkers start chatting. I could tell this angered her because she started making indirect comments about all the stuff that needs to be done but everything she mentioned i already checked, we have had like 4 customers so i don’t understand what needed to be done. I don’t say anything since she wasn’t talking to me but once again i go over everything to make sure everything is good. She’s still complaining.

I finally get one table after an hour and as they are finishing up i bring the check. They did not have any payment ready so i decided to walk to the back which is just a few feet from their table so that i could see when their payment method is on the table. Less than 30 seconds the guy gets up to go pay with the host which is normal at my job. Apparently he was just getting change for my tip and the wife put the card on the table. I had turned around because i didn’t think i needed to cash them out but i was going to still keep an eye on them so i could tell them to have a good rest of their day. This all happened in the span of a minute. I see my coworker (F50) take the card to run it. At my job this is very normal as we are all expected to help each other out and i can’t tell you how many times i had to do stuff for her. Yes i saw her and i could’ve went out the door to say that i would cash them out but i didn’t. I could already sense that she was just looking for something to be mad about and i didn’t do anything wrong. I can take care of my own tables. So then i’m pretty sure she asked them if they wanted a to go drink. 

After they leave she comes in the back and loudly says “you come here” I go to the table and she starts going off on me “your table has been looking for you this entire time”, “i had to do this and that” and i kept trying to explain myself but she was talking over me refusing to let me get a word in. I still said it anyways though. She then goes to multiple coworkers and clearly talks shit about me. She even went into the managers office, all mad slamming doors, acting like a child, just to talk shit about me. All my friends at work told me i did nothing wrong and she’s just miserable. I then hear from a coworker that she’s been telling the managers i come in high and all this and that. My table tipped me $20 on like $35 check too because before this incident with my coworker (they could tell) i was a great server and they had a great time. My coworker complained that i didn’t deserve the tip because she decided  willingly cashed them out.

The next day she apologizes to me and said she “cried” the day before.

I also want to note I am a good server. Do i come in a little stoned? yes, but i have been smoking for years and my tolerance is way different than someone who barely smokes. I also make 2.13 an hour. I just need something to calm my jitteriness. I never smell, i never look high (i have big ass lashes on so i feel like that could mask it) And most importantly, my customers love me. I never even mess up when im high, i make good tips, impress customers. Meanwhile, she is loved by many customers but I can not tell you how many times she angered a customer by being petty and disrespectful and they complain about her being terrible. But of course the manager doesn’t care because she has seniority.

Anyways f them i’m in college anyways i don’t need that job, it’s slow anyways im not making shit.

I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”

About me:

Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.

I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.

I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.

I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.

What I’m hoping for:
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”

About me:

Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.

I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.

I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.

I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.

What I’m hoping for:
Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.

If this made you smile, tell me your favorite comfort food or share the last silly thing that made you laugh way too hard. Who knows, maybe it’s the first page of our story.",2,1759490643.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Anyone with an Early Access save can opt to convert some of their progress into Gold in the 1.0, just follow the ingame instructions! Also, you have free access to a special branch on Steam that keeps the legacy ""0.9"" version live for anyone who wants it, via password. For more details, please see the Guide called ""How to access Early Access save files post launch"".

That makes it worth saying, it's praiseworthy that these two studios are co-existing and both creating awesome experiences, without starting a cascade of frivolous lawsuits claiming one or the other was the first to implement an idea a decade ago. They both have their own style, which they craft into a unique art, learning and sharing off/with one another to make a better game for us to enjoy.

1nww9vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1nww9vh/explore_if_the_supvan_e10_label_maker_is_worth/,Explore if the SUPVAN E10 label maker is worth the investment,"Testing out the SUPVAN E10 Bluetooth Label Maker Machine has been quite the journey. For starters, its design strikes a perfect balance between compactness and functionality. The lightweight build came in handy when I needed to carry it around different corners of my house and office. Measuring just under 8 inches in length, it easily fit into my tote bag, ensuring I could use it wherever inspiration for labeling struck me. The green finish added a dash of charm, making it stand out amidst my otherwise drab office gadgets. While the form factor is lovely, the casing does feel a tad too lightweight, so I wondered how durable it would be in the long run.  

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
The ease of use offered by this portable label printer genuinely surprised me. Setup was seamless; the device connected to my phone via Bluetooth without any unnecessary configurations or registrations. The app used to control it is intuitive, offering a powerful editing suite with over 40 font styles, 30 unique frames, and a whopping 450+ icons to play around with. Designing labels became a creative activity instead of a mundane task. Whether I was labeling spice jars in the kitchen, coffee mugs in the breakroom, or organizing school supplies for my niece, the experience felt refreshingly smooth and enjoyable. That said, those less familiar with smartphone apps might have a slight learning curve initially.  

[Check SUPVAN E10 price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b09jrrbbjk/)  

**Performance and Printing Quality**  
When it comes to label printing, the SUPVAN E10 consistently delivered sharp, clean outputs without smudges. The 203 DPI print resolution ensured my lettering and icon designs popped on every label, whether used for cables, storage boxes, or food containers. Switching between continuous and fixed-size tape wasn’t just useful—it was vital for tackling different tasks, each with its own printing needs. I particularly appreciated the built-in cutter, which added an extra layer of convenience during the process. The laminated label tape did live up to its claims of being waterproof, oil-proof, and scratch-resistant, making it perfect for bathrooms and kitchens. One potential hiccup is that individual labels, once stuck, may leave minor residue upon removal, mainly if they are used on delicate surfaces.

**Power Management and Convenience**  
One standout feature of this label maker is its rechargeable battery. With just a single charge, it lasted me for almost a month. I’ve used labelers in the past that would burn through batteries ridiculously fast, so having a long-lasting battery feels like a godsend. I didn’t need to worry about dealing with AA or AAA cells either, as it charges via USB-C. However, the device could have benefited from a better battery indicator in the app. Currently, estimating battery life requires some guesswork, which sometimes caught me off guard.

**Good Aspects**  
- Lightweight, compact design suited for portability  
- Intuitive app with numerous design customization options  
- Produces waterproof and oil-proof labels  
- Long-lasting rechargeable battery  
- Capable of printing both continuous and fixed-size tape  

**Shortcomings**  
- Lightweight casing may raise concerns about longevity  
- Residue left after peeling labels off certain surfaces  
- Lack of detailed battery life tracking in the app  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the SUPVAN E10 to other competitors in its space, like the DYMO LetraTag and the Brother P-Touch Cube, I found some distinct differences. The DYMO offers excellent standalone functionality, which is ideal for users who don’t want to rely on a smartphone app. However, its design and customization features fall short compared to the edits afforded by SUPVAN’s app. The Brother P-Touch Cube is equally app-reliant but comes at a higher price point, making the SUPVAN E10 a more budget-friendly alternative. Despite its lightweight build, the print quality of the SUPVAN E10 rivals that of its pricier competitors, making it a value-packed option.

**Smart Spending**  
In terms of value proposition, this portable label maker certainly justifies its cost. It has a modern design, smart app integration, premium printing quality, and long-lasting labels—all essential features packed into an easy-to-use device. Its price-to-quality ratio makes it a viable contender for small businesses needing organization solutions and for home users who like to keep things tidy. While there are some areas for improvement, the SUPVAN E10 holds its own firmly in the market.

Started taking screenshots of our best performing ads for future inspiration when I noticed our comments section. Holy hell. It was a disaster.

People were literally asking to buy and we were just... ignoring them?

""Is this available in queen size?"" ""Do u ship to Canada??"" ""What's the weight limit on this"" ""PLEASE tell me you have this in navy""

I grabbed a coffee and decided to do a proper count. Went through a week's worth of ad comments. Out of roughly 200 comments that were obviously from interested buyers, we'd responded to maybe 60-70.

That's when it hit me - we were spending thousands to GET people to our ads, then ignoring them when they showed interest. Absolute amateur hour.

**Here's What We Did About It**

Look, I'm not particularly smart, but even I could see this was fixable. Here's the ugly truth about what we set up (spoiler: it's not rocket science).

**First - ManyChat**

I'll be honest, I hate chatbots. They usually suck. But for Facebook comments? Game changer.

Took me a whole weekend to set up because I kept overcomplicating it. Finally just made it simple:

When someone mentions ""price"" → Bot replies with the price and throws them a 10% discount code for being engaged enough to comment

When they ask about ""shipping"" → Bot tells them shipping info plus that same discount

When they ask literally anything else → Bot says thanks and promises a human will respond within 2 hours

The discount code thing was key. FBCOMMENT10. Not creative, but it works. People feel special for getting a ""secret"" code.

**Second - We Actually Hired Someone to Give a Damn**

Found a VA from the Philippines (shoutout to Maria, you're a legend). $4/hour, works 2 hours every morning.

Her only job:

* Check every single comment from the last 24 hours
* Actually answer them like a human being
* Use personal discount codes when someone has a complex question

This was the game changer. The bot handles the basic stuff, Maria handles the ""hey I want to buy 6 of these for my office but need them in different colors can you help"" people.

**Third - We Track Everything (Because I'm a Nerd)**

Set up different discount codes:

* FBCOMMENT10 - the bot one
* CUSTOM15 - when Maria helps with something complex
* BUNDLE20 - when someone wants multiple items

Every link we share has UTM parameters. Yeah, it's tedious to set up, but now I know EXACTLY how much revenue comes from comments.

# The Actual Numbers (This Is Why You're Here)

Last 90 days:

* $47,381 in revenue from comment discount codes
* 556 orders (out of about 6,400 comments we responded to)
* These customers actually spent MORE on average ($85 vs our normal $79)

But here's what really blew my mind - our ads got cheaper to run. Facebook apparently loves when people engage with your ads and you actually respond. Our CPMs dropped about 15% on ads with high engagement.

Cost to run this:

* ManyChat: $145/month for the pro version
* VA: \~$320/month
* My sanity setting it up: priceless (jk it sucked)

So we're spending $465/month to make an extra $15k+/month. I'll take that trade all day.

**The Dumb Mistakes I Made So You Don't Have To**

**Mistake #1: Making the bot sound like a bot**

First version was all ""GREETINGS HUMAN, CLICK HERE FOR DISCOUNT."" Nobody trusts that shit. Rewrote everything to sound like an actual person typed it. Conversions went up immediately.

**Mistake #2: Not checking old ads**

We had ads that had been running for MONTHS with hundreds of unanswered comments. Went back and responded to comments from 30+ days ago. Actually made several sales from it. People were shocked we responded.

**Mistake #3: Forgetting Instagram exists**

We run the same ads on IG. Guess what has comments too? 🤦‍♂️ Added IG to Maria's workflow in month 2.

**Mistake #4: Not training the VA properly**

First week, Maria was basically just copy-pasting responses. Had to show her that actually being helpful and human makes a massive difference. Now she'll research products, check inventory, even coordinate with our fulfillment team for special requests.

**Some Weird Stuff That's Working**

**The ""Competitor Reconnaissance"" Method**

This is probably sketchy but whatever. I follow all our competitors' ads. When people complain on their ads about shipping times or prices, I don't pitch our store, but I do helpful things like explain how the industry works or give general advice.

These people often check out who's being helpful and find our store naturally. Can't track it directly but I know it's working.

**Comment Mining for Ad Copy**

The comments section is a goldmine for ad copy. People tell you EXACTLY what they care about in their own words. I screenshot the best ones and hand them to our ad team. Our best performing ad headline came directly from a customer comment.

**The ""Sorry We Missed You"" Campaign**

Built a custom audience of everyone who commented but didn't buy. Run retargeting ads that literally start with ""Hey, saw you asked about our \[product\] - here's the answer plus 20% off for your patience.""

9x ROAS on these campaigns. NINE TIMES.

**Final Thoughts**

We spent all this money trying to find new customers while ignoring the ones literally asking us questions. It's like hosting a party and not answering the door.

This isn't revolutionary. It's just doing the obvious thing that most stores are too lazy to do. But that $47k is very real, and it took minimal effort to get there.

The funniest part? Our competitors still aren't doing this. I can see their ads. Hundreds of unanswered comments. Their loss, our gain.

**EDIT:** I think a bunch of people will benefit from the templates and stuff I use. I threw together a Google Doc with:

https://i.redd.it/2e81uprxlvsf1.gif

* My exact ManyChat flows (you can literally copy-paste)

1nww7dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1nww7dc/i_am_yearning_again_after_5_years/,"i am yearning, again, after 5 years","hey, so i have a bit of a story i think.
5 years ago in 2020, i was 15. 
i met this girl online, she (14 back then) lived like 2 hours away from me. 
we got talking and ended up being each others first relationship. for like 2/3 months. so not that serious, we never kissed or something like that, but we were each others first girlfriend.
it ended because i was too much i think, i was finally comfortable with my sexuality and so excited to have my first girlfriend, that i became a bit obsessed, if you can call it that at that age. we eventually blocked each other and never spoke or saw each other again after those 5 years.
fast forward to two weeks ago. i got a flashback on snapchat that i met her for the first time, and i thought well, lets just unblock her on instagram and follow her, because why not?
she immediately followed me back and send a message asking how i was doing.
i was actually amazed since we never had spoken after the breakup. so i told her that as well. she replied with saying she was curious how im doing right now after all these years. eventually i asked her if she was up to getting coffee sometime, since you cant really tell about the past 5 years of your life on text right.
so we did, and it actually was so much fun.
first i was nervous because you are really just meeting with someone you dont really know, since 5 years, age 15 to age 20, is kind of a big jump you know. later i heard she was also nervous for the same reason haha.
but we had a drink in the city we met up in, eventually drove to her city to have another drink, and ended up playing a few games of pool. i had such a good time, and im pretty sure she did as well, since we just clicked, the same as 5 years ago.

okay so now a bit more further in the story, back then i had long hair, braces, glasses, really just a 15 year old girl in skinny jeans who was only JUST getting comfortable with herself.
but right now, i have short hair, no braces or glasses, lots of tattoos, and if i can say so myself, a much better and cooler streetwear style of clothing, and comfortable with herself.

she hasnt changed that much, maybe more confident, a tattoo here and there, a nose piercing.
but still the girl i see as my first ever (maybe not that serious) girlfriend.
and we still just had that same exact feeling like how we clicked 5 years ago.

now, she has a girlfriend for like almost 2 years i think. 
her girlfriend knew we were meeting up and was okay with everything, since she also know we were never in a serious relationship. also they never had any fights or conflicts about jealousy or anything.
BUT
she told me somewhere in one of the conversations we had, her type is like masc girls. and since i am one, and her girlfriend knows that, i think her girlfriend may have started feeling weird about it eventually.
we met at 1pm, and around 6pm when we just arrived at the place we were going to have a few games of pool. she told me her girlfriend started getting angry at her for staying so late with me. mind you, we were only there for like 4/5 hours, and you cant expect people to chat up 5 years in such a short amount of time, right??
she started asking me for advice since she had never been in such a situation, also this is her only real relationship she had after me.
(i have had a few serious relationships since the past 5 years)
but i also didnt want to get in between them, so i told her if she wanted to just go home to her girlfriend to talk this out, she should.
but she told me she was having such a fun time, and her girlfriend acting this way actually wanted her to stay even longer with me.
again i didnt want to come in between this, so i said we could walk back to my car at around 8pm, and she could go to her girlfriend since my car was close to the place they were meeting. 
we were kinda early so we chatted a bit in the car, and she was saying how she was so stressed, and thinking her girlfriend wanted to breakup, and saying how much easier it would be if she was single so she could just do whatever she wanted. 
i dont know why, but it really felt like she was just delaying everything so we could talk longer, like in the same way we did 5 years ago as well?

when i was finally home, later that evening i got a text that she had a really fun time, and we should meet again in my city soon, and that she felt sorry the day had to end like this.
i told her it was okay and that i hope she and her girlfriend talked it out.
and luckily they did.

but i dont know, there was this kind of vibe going on when we were together that day. different than 5 years ago. but kind of yearning from her side as well. i think if she didnt have a girlfriend the day couldve ended in a whole other way.
i mean i will never know, but i kinda just do right?
also she told me her and her girlfriend are not going great the past few months.
and it just keeps lingering in my head. am i crazy or was there still something there all those years later? we still have the same humour, we are really each others types now physically, and have the same opinions still.

am i crazy? 
and why am i still thinking about this",4,1759490001.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

[US financing surge fuels next wave of critical minerals - Special Feature - Mining.com.au](https://mining.com.au/financing-surge-fuels-next-wave-of-critical-minerals/)

https://preview.redd.it/e87e3f39rvsf1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=039750b41137ca406f78760760bd1887282f61b8

The US continues to set aside billions of dollars for investment as it scrambles to shore up its critical minerals supply and attempt to dethrone China as the world’s resources powerhouse.

In Q3 2025, the US International Development Finance was reportedly in talks to funnel US$5 billion ($7.6 billion) into strategic mining investments to aid in boosting the country’s critical mineral supplies. 

*Bloomberg* reported in mid-September that the proposed new joint fund with New York-based investment firm Orion Resource would be a completely new avenue of funding enabling the US Government to invest directly into large-scale deals. 

The Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of the US also continues to ramp up its funding support for critical minerals projects.  

In July, EXIM handed a letter of interest to [NexMetals Mining](https://nexmetalsmining.com/) (TSX-V:NEXM) indicating the potential for up to US$150 million in financing. 

The funding would support the re-development of NexMetals’ Selebi and Selkirk nickel-copper-cobalt-platinum group metal mines in Botswana. 

EXIM also advised that the procurement of US goods and services for the Selebi and Selkirk mines may be eligible for special consideration under its China and Transformational Exports Program. 

In the same quarter, EXIM expressed interest in providing up to US$67 million to support the development of [Sunrise Energy Metals’](https://sunriseem.com/) (ASX:SRL) Syerston Scandium Project in central-west New South Wales.

The company is investigating the potential to produce a high-purity scandium oxide product in Australia.

On the same day the EXIM news was announced, successful global investment strategist Kiril Sokoloff increased his stake in Sunrise Energy to 8.95%, from 5.21%, at a cost of $2 million through the exercise of options.  

Sokoloff is the Chairman and founder of 13D Research & Strategy and has been an advisor to many of the largest pools of global capital for over three decades. 

His company’s client base includes large-scale money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, large private and public corporations, family offices, private equity and distressed funds, high-net-worth individuals and hedge funds.

# Billionaire investor Robert Friedland bets on scandium

Also backing Sunrise Energy is American-Canadian billionaire mining financier Robert Friedland, who serves as the company’s co-Chair.

Sunrise Energy CEO Sam Riggall tells [*Mining.com.au*](http://Mining.com.au) that while it is still early days, the company is seeing rising interest from potential customers, particularly out of North America. 

*“We can see not only existing customers for scandium, but a whole range of new customers who are emerging, looking to qualify scandium as a key part of their production platform, whether it’s in the defence or civilian sectors,”* he says. 

*“So that’s really encouraging, and those volumes are potentially very large.* 

*“We expect that you’re looking probably within a decade at a market that needs maybe 100 to 150 tonnes of scandium oxide annually, but there’s a lot of potential upside on that if adoption is fast.”* 

The third quarter of 2025 was also defined by battery technology advancements that could potentially open up new markets for scandium.  

Researchers from the Tokyo University of Science worked out that by adding scandium to sodium-ion battery cathodes it could [improve](https://mining.com.au/victory-celebrates-new-scandium-research-with-north-stanmore/) the structural stability and life cycle.  

[Scandium enabled the battery to retain 60&#37; capacity after 300 cycles. ](https://preview.redd.it/fr0j6h8ycvsf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=8576c159e3c14ad73d7ecdf6c321c059e05dbbbf)

[Victory Metals](https://www.victorymetalsaustralia.com/) (ASX:VTM) says this advancement underscores scandium’s potential to become a cornerstone of future energy storage technologies.

This is in addition to already established applications using scandium in aerospace, defence and advanced alloys.

Victory’s North Stanmore Project in Western Australia hosts a rare earths resource that also comprises 7.7 million kilograms of scandium.

CEO Brendan Clark says Victory is emerging as one of the very few Australian companies positioned to deliver scandium oxide as a byproduct from a clay-hosted heavy rare earth project.

*“With scandium oxide priced at US$630 per kilogram and Victory targeting scandium oxide in the first 10 years of operations under a low-throughput solution, we see this as an incredible revenue stream alongside the heavy rare earths,”* he says. 

In July, Victory received approval under the US Government’s System for Award Management to engage with US agencies including the Department of Defense and EXIM.

EXIM expressed interest earlier in the year in providing up to US$190 million in financing for the North Stanmore Project. 

# Antimony contract highlights defence stockpile importance

Antimony also dominated headlines in the third quarter, with one of the most recent developments being [United States Antimony Corporation](https://www.usantimony.com/) (NYSE American:UAMY) winning a US$245 million contract with the US Defense Logistics Agency.

United States Antimony Corporation operates North America’s only two antimony smelters, while the US Defense Logistics Agency oversees the National Defense Stockpile (NDS).

The company has been contracted to supply antimony metal ingots to the NDS. 

At the end of September, antimony ingots were selling for around US$22,151 per tonne, while refined high-purity antimony traded at around US$68,000 per tonne, according to the Shanghai Metals Market.  

Vancouver-headquartered [Arizona Gold & Silver](https://arizonagoldsilver.com/) (TSX-V:AZS) is now re-assessing the antimony occurrences within its Silverton Gold-Antimony Project in Nevada given the current high price and government support.

The Silverton property database contains multi-element geochemistry from over 2,000 rock samples collected by previous explorers, including Newcrest Resources, between 2002 and 2004.

The database has over 25 surface samples that contain greater than 1% antimony.

Newcrest Resources also drilled 15 reverse circulation (RC) percussion holes that all contained anomalous antimony values.

One hole intersected 20 feet at over 1% antimony at a depth of between 100 and 120 feet.

Arizona Gold & Silver has now submitted a notice of intent to the US Bureau of Land Management to drill 27 RC holes.   

The company says the potential is high for a near-surface deposit of antimony, comprising high-grade veins similar to the historical intersection reported by Newcrest Resources. 

Arizona Gold & Silver plans to investigate a possible joint venture to test the antimony-gold mineralisation and targets identified in an earlier helicopter magnetotelluric survey over the Silverton property.  

Junior Western Australia-based explorer [Trigg Minerals](https://trigg.com.au/) (ASX:TMG), meanwhile, is planning to rebrand following its expansion in antimony in the US.

The company is rebadging itself as American Antimony and Tungsten after striking a binding [deal](https://mining.com.au/trigg-sets-off-new-us-antimony-acquisition/) with Wyoming Mines to acquire the Central Idaho Antimony Project in the US.

More advanced down the path towards antimony production, [Locksley Resources](https://locksleyresources.com.au/) (ASX:LKY) is expediting its US mine to market strategy with two recent leadership appointments. 

The company named Kerrie Matthews as CEO and Danny George as COO.

Locksley’s ambition is to [position](https://mining.com.au/locksley-sets-sights-on-100-made-in-america-antimony-production/) itself as the US beachhead for mining, sourcing and processing of antimony. 

The company has a portfolio of antimony and rare earths projects in California located around 1.4km from [MP Materials’](https://mpmaterials.com/) (NYSE:MP) Mountain Pass mine – one of the highest grade rare earths mines globally and the only producing facility in the US.  

Head of Critical Minerals Allister Caird tells [*Mining.com.au*](http://Mining.com.au) Locksley has been proactive in building out a team of Australian and US advisors to strengthen market positioning. 

*“Recent partnerships like Greenmet and Rice University out of the US, directly connect us to funding pathways and policy makers in the US,”* he notes.  

*“Simultaneously, we are laying the foundations from our offices in Perth. The team is in regular communication with our advisors network in a bid to accelerate our US initiatives and further align ourselves with the push to onshore critical minerals.”*

In the final quarter of the year, the first samples of ore from Locksley’s Mojave Antimony and Rare Earths Project, as well as the recently contracted ore from [EV Resources](https://evresources.com.au/) (ASX:EVR), are expected to arrive at the Rice University lab.

*“These will be used to develop our DeepSolv™ antimony processing capability,”* Caird tells this news service  

*“In parallel to both our upstream and downstream activity, with the help of our in-country partners, we will continue to pursue additional funding opportunities within the US.”*

Critical Metals (Nasdaq: CRML) will lift its ownership in the Tanbreez rare earth project in southern Greenland to 92.5%, positioning itself to control one of the [world’s largest rare earth deposits](https://www.mining.com/featured-article/ranked-worlds-top-10-rare-earth-projects/), major shareholder European Lithium (ASX: EUR) [announced Thursday](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/EUR/03002441.pdf).

Under the revised agreement, Critical Metals will raise its stake in Tanbreez Mining Greenland AS from 42% to 92.5% by issuing 14.5 million shares to Rimbal Pty Ltd, a company controlled by project founder Gregory Barnes. The agreed price of $8 per share represents a 23% premium to Critical Metals’ last close of $6.49, valuing the transaction at $116 million.

Barnes waived an earlier requirement for Critical Metals to invest $10 million before qualifying for the increased stake. The deal remains subject to Greenland government approval, with closing expected in October or November 2025.

European Lithium will retain its 7.5% interest in Tanbreez, alongside a 60% shareholding in Critical Metals, worth about $408 million at current prices. “This significant milestone agreement with Mr. Greg Barnes and Rimbal positions us to be laser focused on bringing this world-class asset into production,” Tony Sage, European Lithium’s executive chairman, said.

“This significant milestone agreement with Mr. Greg Barnes and Rimbal positions us to be laser focused on bringing this world-class asset into production,” European Lithium executive chairman, Sage said.

# Game-changer

The Tanbreez project contains one of the world’s largest untapped heavy rare earth (HREE) deposits, with more than 27% HREE content and an estimated 4.7 billion tonnes of host rock. Barnes described the project as “a game-changer” for the rare earths supply chain in the West. 

China currently dominates the sector, accounting for [about 60%](https://www.mining.com/china-flexes-rare-earth-dominance-with-million-tonne-discovery/) of global rare earth production and 85% of processing capacity. In 2023, its production totalled 240,000 tonnes, nearly six times that of the United States.

Critical Metals’ [March preliminary economic assessment](https://www.mining.com/pea-values-critical-metals-tanbreez-rare-earth-project-in-greenland-at-3b/) valued Tanbreez at a pre-tax net present value of $3.04 billion, with an internal rate of return of 180%.

The deal comes as the UK, EU allies and Greenland are [reportedly exploring a critical minerals partnership](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-greenland-critical-minerals-deal-partnership/). Greenland’s foreign minister has [signalled interest in expanding EU ties](https://www.mining.com/greenland-urges-us-europe-to-invest-in-its-minerals-or-china-will/), highlighting the island’s mineral wealth as a key area for cooperation.

USA Rare Earth shares jumped 10% in premarket trading on Friday, after a report that the mining company's CEO **Barbara Humpton** said it was in close discussions with the White House.

Humpton was addressing a question about the company's potential interest in striking a deal with the Trump administration, in an interview with CNBC late on Thursday.

USA Rare Earth did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

US President **Donald Trump** had invoked emergency powers in March to boost domestic production of critical minerals as part of a broad effort to offset China's near-total control of the sector.

Earlier this week, the Trump administration took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a separate 5% stake in the company's Thacker Pass joint venture with General Motors, which is set to be the largest lithium source in the Western Hemisphere.

MP Materials had also unveiled a multibillion-dollar deal with the US government in July to boost output of rare earth magnets, with the defense department becoming its largest shareholder.

Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion. China had halted exports in March as part of a trade spat with Trump, which showed some signs of easing in June even as broader tensions underscored the need for greater US output.

USA Rare Earth has been developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas and a neo magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, currently planned to go commercial in the first half of 2026.

As of last close, its shares have gained 97.8% so far this year, giving the company a market capitalisation of about $2.59-billion.

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $110M— funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. **(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

# 🚨 Game-changing moves in critical minerals — October 2025 is here!

Washington just raised the stakes — securing a 5% equity position in Lithium Americas. This sets a powerful precedent that signals the U.S. government isn’t just talking about resource security, it’s deploying capital. This follows the exact playbook for NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project, which controls the only U.S. resource base uniting niobium, titanium (TiCl₄), scandium, and rare earths under one roof. What’s more, this isn’t just a mining operation — it’s a strategic platform for U.S. sovereignty in defense, electric vehicles (EVs), aerospace, and clean energy.

**As October unfolds, the narrative converges. NioCorp takes center stage with two major catalysts:**

1. **Munich Mining Conference (Oct. 3–4) –** NioCorp presents at this critical event, sharing their game-changing plans for the Elk Creek Project, further solidifying their position as a global leader in critical minerals.
2. **Critical Minerals Forum Summit (Oct. 8, 11:05 AM ET**) – NioCorp’s participation in this high-level Washington, D.C. event places them directly in the spotlight as they prepare to reveal drill results that could scale their Total Rare Earth Oxide (TREO) to 1,000,000 tonnes, which feeds directly into the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS).

**The Pending October Drill Results & Q-4 DFS are the next major milestones —** locking in capex, opex, NPV, RailVeyor efficiencies, and expanded reserves. This will turn speculation into hard models, providing the concrete numbers that institutional investors and strategic partners need to get behind NioCorp.

Meanwhile, Elk Creek’s district is increasingly validated as the hotbed of multi-metal potential. Apex’s land acquisition adjacent to NioCorp’s footprint, plus Dahrouge’s involvement, creates a well-networked development strategy poised for explosive growth.

# Key catalysts continuing to build momentum:

* Alloy adoption announcements in November expected to expand the strategic impact.
* EXIM/DFC financing decisions anticipated in the near future, potentially unlocking new funding and strategic backing.
* Maxim’s price target boost to $12 signals confidence in NioCorp’s ability to execute.
* Talk of potential government or prime contractor equity stakes heightening interest and signaling an increasing likelihood of high-value partnerships.

With all these catalysts perfectly aligned — from policy and finance to geology — Q4 2025 is shaping up to be the launch window for Elk Creek and NioCorp’s future. The countdown is on. 🚀

# NioCorp —is shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. 🚀

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I've had about 6-8 shots of espresso per day, while making a few drinks for friends and family members too. My roommate and I went through our entire 12 oz bag of beans in less than two days lol

I know my standard for coffee was low before this, but now I can never go back. I don't see myself ever buying starbucks or being able to drink from a Keurig again now that my eyes have been opened.

**Wise -** This narrative appears suspicious; we ought to definitely consult someone to guarantee our safety. 

**Belle - I**ndeed. I believe I have a candidate in mind. How about Trigger? If there is anyone capable of identifying Isolde from a distance and ensuring our safety, it is her. 

**Wise -** Let us take our chance.

*The subsequent night, just minutes prior to midnight, you position yourself in the parking lot behind Random play. Gazing at the top of a building, you notice the lens of Trigger’s sniper rifle glinting. The woman waves and gives you a thumbs up, prompting you to refocus on the impending encounter. A few minutes later, the sound of footsteps reaches your ears, and from the shadows, a figure emerges. Once illuminated by the streetlamp, you can clearly identify the person, and you fall silent for a prolonged moment, uncertain whether to feel anger or surprise. Trigger discreetly communicates her analysis to you through the comms.* 

**Trigger** \- Confirming the presence of proxies. It is indeed her. An ethereal doppelganger cannot be this far from Lemnian hollow. The NEDF maintains strict oversight of the edges of Hollows. 

**Isolde** \- Greetings, Mr. Wise and Ms. Belle. Being cautious, are we? *\*Sighs, placing a hand on her forehead\** 

**Belle** \- Huh? No, it’s not… 

**Isolde** \- You see, I have trained this squad for such an extended period that I am well-acquainted with their tactics. How suspicious it is, this shiny reflection on the rooftop in the dead of night, wouldn’t you agree? I can identify Charon's tactical strategy at play here. 

**Wise** \- Nothing can be concealed…

**Isolde** \- Fear not, proxies; I am not here to inflict harm but to provide clarification. *\*Smiling\**

**Belle -** Is it truly you? I mean, we witnessed your crystallized form disintegrating into dust following the battle at Exaltist headquarters… 

**Isolde -** Proxies, did you receive that letter I requested Magus to deliver to you? I sent it to Suibian Temple, anticipating your presence there. Has anyone else read it? *\*Serious and insistent\** 

**Belle -** No. No one. 

**Isolde -** Excellent, this indicates that my plan has, in some way, succeeded. \*Checks the time\* Time is up. I apologize, but I must exercise caution. Let us resume our discussion tomorrow night. I will be waiting for you at Ballet tower plaza. If you remain concerned about your safety, you may bring Charon with you.

— 

**Intro trust commission 2**

*As scheduled, you will travel to Ballet Plaza at midnight the following day. Once again, you choose to bring Trigger along with you.*

**Isolde** \- Excellent. You have arrived punctually. *\*Crosses her arms behind her back\** 

**Belle/Wise** \- I still have questions. 

**Isolde** \- That is understandable. Previously, I had to truncate our conversation. I wish to avoid certain individuals overhearing what I intend to discuss with you, as it is a delicate issue. 

**Belle/Wise** \- Are you concerned about potential retaliations? *\*Intrigued\** 

**Isolde** \- My experiences with the Exaltists have taught me that Sarah should not be underestimated. This is why I felt compelled to write you this letter. To ensure that my demise appeared credible. To take on all the blame for the crimes. 

**Trigger** \- Perhaps you could share your insights regarding Sarah with us? *\*Looks away\** Your death profoundly affected us, the entire Obol squad; we genuinely believed you were deceased. 

**Isolde** \- Although I would like to assist, Sarah orchestrates her schemes well in advance and is a person shrouded in secrets. Unfortunately, she did not disclose her plans to me. I possess as much knowledge as you do, that she is a devoted follower of that creator and would eliminate anyone who disrupts her peculiar plots and ideas. They conducted a ceremony, and a choir performed mantras to transform me into an Overseer as I received a cursed seal on my hand. Now that I am no longer present, I assume it will be the second most influential individual who will become the Overseer, namely Sarah. The worshippers are indifferent to who is in power, as long as there is someone. *\*Shrug\**

**Belle/Wise -** Hmm. Are you in danger? Are exaltists pursuing you? \*Worried\* 

**Isolde -** I doubt that Sarah harbors any resentment towards me; I have served her plans effectively. To be honest, if she is still seeking someone, it would likely be the Yunkui summit or you, the proxy siblings. However, due to the collateral damage I caused at Failume Heights, I am no longer particularly welcome here. 

**Belle/Wise -** I understand. Perhaps you could spend some time at Lumina Square and Sixth Street? I heard Magus mention that the Obol squad is currently on vacation following the conclusion of the events at the exaltist hideout… and, well… your staged death. *\*Pondering\** 

**Isolde -** I have never been fond of court martials, but if I must endure one, or even a trial, to walk freely in the streets and see my Orpheus more often, I would do so. 

**Belle/Wise -** I have noticed you frequently mention your Orpheus. Are you referring to Orphie? Or is it Magus? *\*Curious\** 

**Isolde -** Both. They are both flowers from the same seed. I love them both as a mother loves her child. I share a particularly close bond with Magus; that fiery child has had a challenging journey within the NEDF, and the days have not always been bright. Yet, I supported her until she became an exceptional soldier and attained the rank of squad Captain. She is a wonderful girl. Orphie, in a way, reminds me of her—curious to learn more and always striving to do her best. 

**Trigger -** If you truly care about Orphie and Magus, you ought to take action. 

**Isolde -** Yes. *\*Lost in thoughts\** It has been a pleasure conversing with both of you. I believe it is time for me to release my past. I will head to the NEPS station in Lumina Square tomorrow. I can only hope it does not end in the worst possible way.

*The quality events known as the ""Isolde trial"" become accessible upon the completion of the two trust commissions. Please refer to my other post for details regarding the content of the Isolde Trial. (https://www.reddit.com/r/IsoldeMainsZZZ/comments/1nv8n6h/fanwork\_fanficton\_isoldes\_trial\_redemption\_by\_me/* *)*

*Trust tier 1 has been unlocked. Trust interactions and the elevation of trust levels cannot occur or be enhanced until you have completed the five quality instances related to Isolde’s trial. Isolde is being monitored at Lumina Square by NEPS, with Zhu Yuan and Jane taking into account the assessed threat level.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Trust events, Environmental interactions (Only within Invites), Invitations.**

Trust events (Agent is already somewhere, you have to meet them here):

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

**1- Isolde's flowers. ( Lumina Square )**

*Isolde stands by the flower shop, smiling as you approach, and she invites you to join her.* 

**Isolde** \- Mr. Wise, Ms. Belle, what a pleasant surprise. I was just searching for you. I wanted to present you with a gift as a token of my appreciation for your support during my trial. It may seem trivial to you, but I hope you will accept these flowers as a gesture of my gratitude. A bouquet is showcased, featuring a base of red flowers with white ones on top. 

**Wise/Belle** \- We are pleased that everything has turned out well for you after all these events. These flowers are truly lovely. Thank you. 

**Isolde** \- This hardly suffices to convey my deep appreciation for your help. 

**Wise/Belle** \- You may address us by our first names, Miss Isolde. 

**Isolde** \- I will certainly do that. Until we meet again?

\---

**2 - Obol Squad food refill (Sixth street 141)**

*Isolde stands by the 141 stand, appearing somewhat troubled.* 

**Isolde** \- Hmm. It appears that their supply of Lemon chips has been completely depleted. Sigh. 

**Belle/Wise** \- Are you searching for something? 

**Isolde** \- Oh. Greetings. I didn’t notice your arrival. Please disregard me; I am in the process of acquiring various items for the remainder of the Obol squad. I managed to find red bean buns and some instant noodles… but it seems that all the customers opted for chips. 

**Belle/Wise** \- Oh. So Orphie won’t have a snack then? 

**Isolde** \- Ah. No need to worry. I have secured her orange-flavored soda. She will be alright. *\*Tilts head\** What about you? Were you searching for something? Or perhaps it was me? 

*-> I was looking for some goods. (Trust down)* 

*-> I was looking for you. (Trust up)* 

**Isolde** \- I’m pleased to see you have found what you were seeking. Perhaps we will cross paths again?

\---

**3 - Isolde's fortunate ticket (Sixth Street, Howl's stand)** 

*Isolde appears to be perusing Howl’s newspaper stand.* 

**Isolde** \- Hmm. The lottery numbers for today… perhaps I should have placed a bet… 

**Belle/Wise** \- Hello, I didn’t anticipate seeing you here, reading the newspapers? 

**Isolde** \- My birthday is among the chosen numbers. Quite surprising, to be honest. What a delightful surprise to encounter you here; are you a frequent visitor to Howl’s? I used to seek guidance from Shao at the Suibian temple; I was quite fascinated by the trigrams. However, I have developed a new habit here. This dog is absolutely charming. Do you think I should try my luck by purchasing a daily scratch card? I am somewhat hesitant. 

*-> Certainly! We cannot know; perhaps you are fortunate. (Trust up)* 

*-> To be honest, it’s not worth it. (Trust down, end talk)* 

**Isolde** \- Oh, I won! I’m pleased you encouraged me to get one; it appears I am indeed lucky today. It seems the clover I chose to wear was beneficial.

\---

**4 - Obol squad at restaurant (Lumina Square, Restaurant)**

*Isolde is present with the Obol squad and appears to be coordinating something.* 

**Isolde** \- It seems that everyone is here. We can certainly enter and enjoy a meal together. 

**Soldier 11** \- I truly hope they offer spicy food options here, perhaps some noodles. 

**Trigger** \- Personally, I will opt for something sweet. With some exquisite seasoning. 

**Seed** \- Unfortunately, there are no options that include petals or flowers. I will settle for a salad.

**Orphie** \- Mmh, the fish and chips with lemon looks very appetizing. 

**Magus** \- I will have some nitrofuel. However, if anyone orders meat, I can roast it. 

**Isolde** \- Wait everyone, it appears a mysterious guest has just arrived. 

**Belle/Wise** \- Hello! It seems you are planning to eat something? 

**Isolde** \- Belle/Wise! Would you care to join us? 

**Magus** \- Are you sure? Perhaps Proxy has other commitments. 

**Orphie** \- Oh come on, Magus, having one more person won’t hurt anyone. It will be more enjoyable! 

*You enter the restaurant with the Obol squad and savor a delightful meal, with each member discussing their respective activities. Trigger and Seed uplift the atmosphere, and time passes quickly. Once you finish, you all step outside to converse.* 

**Seed** \- That was very delicious! 

**Orphie** \- Indeed, and for once, Magus didn’t create any disturbances with the staff! 

**Magus** \- Hey, be careful with that! 

**Isolde** \- Calm down, Captain Magus. *\*Giggle\** Thank you for joining us, Proxy; it was a pleasure to have you with us. Please feel free to join her if the opportunity arises. (Trust up)

https://preview.redd.it/jeu6ac3cpvsf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef3f646edadc62f55c20f07c1169728e7e7d45db

*Isolde arrives at the Sixth Street metro station, and then she follows you to Tin Master.* 

**Isolde** \- Thank you once more for inviting me; unfortunately, an elderly lady like myself does not receive many invitations. *\*Shy\** 

**Belle/Wise** \- Let us enjoy a warm beverage together. There are plenty of available seats today! 

*You and Isolde enjoy warm beverages together; while you opt for a coffee, she chooses a cup of hot water into which she adds the contents of a tea bag she retrieved from one of her pockets. Occasionally, she offers a smile, and at times, she even blushes. It is evident that she is genuinely touched by the invitation to spend time together. Isolde shares several stories about the Obol Squad during your time together. As night approaches, Isolde starts to rise and gets ready to leave.* 

**Isolde** \- I had a delightful time with you. Can you drop me off at Scott Outpost?

*Once arrived at Scott Outpost, Isolde tells her goodbyes to you.*

**Isolde** \- Please feel free to invite me again. *\*Happy\** Isolde briefly holds your hand, nods her head, and then departs with a smile.

\-------------

**Invite 2 :  Relaxation time (Lumina Square -> Mirage sea resort)  Evening.**

https://preview.redd.it/aamnndefpvsf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=695d1871d2402a84f0295ea5bc0de5211b67d677

*Isolde arrives at Lumina Square metro station, and then she follows you to Old Duri.* 

**Isolde** \- Just in time! I was concerned that you might have gotten lost. I am quite a frequent visitor at the care institute of Old Duri, and due to my loyalty, I had a coupon to offer to someone who would accompany me. You were the first person who came to mind. 

**Belle/Wise** \- That is very kind of you. But why me? And for which service is this coupon valid? Is it applicable to any of them? *\*Curious and intrigued\** 

**Isolde** \- You are a store manager, correct? You either spend your entire day sitting in a chair or constantly running through the aisles. You need to allow your muscles to relax from time to time. Regarding the coupon, it entitles you to one free massage with the purchase of one massage. We will enjoy it together. Let’s go. I had a challenging day, and it is time to unwind. 

*Isolde and you then enter the institute, and alongside Isolde, you experience a massage from the hands of Old Duri. In just a few moments, you begin to feel your body relaxing. Isolde watches you closely, ensuring that Old Duri does not apply too much pressure on your back with its numerous arms. Isolde's tone is softer and more soothing, almost maternal, as she converses with you during the massage. As the session continues, you feel all your worries melting away. Once the entire experience concludes, you exit the establishment with Isolde.* 

**Belle/Wise** \- I feel quite rejuvenated. It was a delightful experience. 

**Isolde** \- I’m pleased to hear that you enjoyed it. How about we travel together to Mirage Sea Resort? The sun hasn’t set yet, and it would make for a wonderful photograph. Taking your van, you journey with Isolde to the sea resort. Isolde guides you to the beach as the sunset promises to be stunning this evening. After strolling together on the sand, Isolde smiles at you and poses a question. 

**Isolde** \- It has been a lovely day, and I would like to have a keepsake of it. Could you take a picture of us with the sunset on this beautiful beach?

*You bring your camera to capture a selfie with Isolde.* 

***Wise/Belle*** *- I also had a delightful day, and I appreciate your company. Here is the photograph.* 

***Isolde*** *- What a lovely image. Could you please take me back to Lumina Square before we say our farewells? I would be very thankful.* 

*After escorting her back to Lumina Square, she departs with a thank you and a bow in your direction, casting one last glance at you while giving a timid wave with her hand.*

*-----------------*

**Invite 3 :  A Ballad Together (Ballet tower plaza)**

https://preview.redd.it/m6puz0i0qvsf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=be7422ee1681d9812143b56845ea53af7676587b

**Wise/Belle** \- Oh! You have arrived already? 

**Isolde** \- I was eagerly anticipating spending time with you. 

*Isolde approaches the Ballet plaza statue and gazes at the Hollow with a sense of sadness.* 

**Wise/Belle** \- Are you lost in thought? 

**Isolde** \- Memories of the past. Looking at this hollow, I ponder, were we truly heroes back then, eleven years ago? Did we meet the expectations of the citizens who believed in our ability to protect them? So many lives lost. So many families shattered. 

*-> It is not your fault; what occurs, occurs. (Trust up)* 

*-> Perhaps you were not sufficient. (Trust down)* 

**Isolde** \- Indeed. Yet, simultaneously, observing all those residential buildings… I feel as though we made a difference. We allowed children to thrive. We permitted life to persist. I appreciate your presence with me today, M Wise/Ms Belle.

\-------------------

**Invite 4 : Music Concert (Reverb Arena) Evening.**

https://preview.redd.it/97il3fu3qvsf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=511802cd61cbcf9c648e15ef523a189c06ba3a87

**Isolde** \- Excellent, you have arrived early. Had you not, I might have aimed a Denny at you with my toy. 

**Wise/Belle** \- Oh, come on, do you not believe you have already overused that joke? 

**Isolde** \- Hmm. Indeed. I apologize. I concur that it may be somewhat inappropriate following recent events. I am delighted to attend this Jazz concert with you; I truly value the band performing here tonight. I would not have minded going to Error 404, but this band exclusively performs here, at Reverb Arena. Allow me to purchase a drink for you. Do you have any preferences? 

*-> I would prefer a fruit-flavored soda.* 

*-> I am fine with some iced tea.* 

*Isolde buys some drinks from the stand and then returns to you, grasping the iron barriers. The band finally takes the stage and begins to play their songs with captivating rhythms and melodies. Isolde is enjoying herself, swaying her hips and moving her hands like a metronome. In sync, you mimic her movements. You lose yourself in the music. Eventually, the concert concludes, and Isolde inquires about your thoughts.* 

**Isolde** \- What did you think of it, my friend? Did it suit your taste? 

*-> I truly cherished this moment with you. The songs were fantastic! (Trust up)* 

*-> It was acceptable; you appeared to have a wonderful time. (Trust down)*

*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

**BONUS : Isolde’s Random Play Event. Promoting Tapes.**

Isolde's favorite movie/video tape: Final Punch. 

*""An unfortunate couple becomes involved in a car accident, resulting in both becoming amputees. To help his girlfriend emerge from her depression and to cover their costly medical expenses, the man installs a pair of mechanical legs and enrolls himself in an underground boxing tournament. Violent clashes between fists and the mechanical limbs occur, and the intense competitions filled with action-packed fight scenes excite the audience. The film dedicates only a brief moment to its depiction of love. However, when this iron man, who dominates the ring, reveals a gentle side solely to his beloved, this simple yet brief scene stands out as a gem in the film.""*

This is Isolde's preferred film because the mechanical limbs remind her of Magus. This movie intertwines the determination to fight back in the face of sadness with a touch of tenderness. It resonates with how Isolde perceives the Obol squad. All members face challenges, whether physical or psychological, yet in the end, they all stand together in this small family of compassion known as the Obol squad. 

**Isolde** \- Hello. I would like to inquire if it is possible to rent the movie ""Final Punch"". I heard it is available in your store. 

**Belle/Wise** \- If you wish, we can also watch it together; we have a video player on the first floor.

**Isolde** \- I wouldn’t want to inconvenience you and your sibling. *\*Embarrassed\** Are you truly certain there are no issues? 

**Belle/Wise** \- Everything is perfectly fine. You are welcome! Please, if you can, follow me... 

*Isolde settled comfortably next to you in the bedroom to watch Final Punch. As the film unfolds, Isolde snuggles closer during the poignant scenes and occasionally asks for your thoughts, commenting on various moments. The conclusion of the movie, where the protagonist expresses his feelings for his wife, brings a small tear to Isolde's eye.*

**Isolde** \- It was truly an enjoyable film. It brings to mind the Obol squad, evoking a sense of familial connection. Regarding my Orpheus, they have all become exceptionally talented now. 

**Belle/Wise** \- You genuinely care for the Obol squad. It appears that you share a unique bond with Orphie and Magus. 

**Isolde** \- I feel comfortable sharing this with you. When Magus lost her physical form, it felt like a catastrophe to me. I am grateful that we managed to preserve her consciousness. I wish for nothing but good for Orphie; she is invaluable. She reminds me so much of Magus. I have witnessed this squad grow year after year. I initially established it with Magus, and then we brought in Trigger, Soldier 11… the most recent addition being Seed. Each day, seeing their smiles brings me joy. 

**Belle/Wise** \- You have always been there for them. They have been concerned about you, you know. You didn’t need to join the Exaltists. The past is behind you. You should cherish your time with them now. 

**Isolde** \- You are correct. I appreciate your advice. I will continue to care for them in a motherly manner as always. Thank you for enlightening me, Wise/Belle. I feel I can rely on you now when I am feeling low or in need of assistance.

1nww0t8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nww0t8,Lesser Known Uses of Coffee - Olfactory Receptor Reset,"If you’ve been to a perfume store, you might have seen little jars of coffee beans sitting around (like in the pic I snapped today).

They’re not for sale; they’re there to reset your nose. When you smell too many fragrances back-to-back, your olfactory receptors get “tired” (a phenomenon called olfactory fatigue or “nose blindness”). Coffee beans are believed to act as a sort of nasal palate cleanser, helping you pick up new scents more accurately.

Interestingly, some perfumers say the effect is more psychological than scientific and that simply smelling fresh air can be just as effective. Still, it’s become a ritual in the fragrance world, and most customers swear by it.

So next time you’re testing perfumes and feel overwhelmed, don’t just keep sniffing bottles; take a whiff of coffee beans (or even step outside for a breath of fresh air) to give your nose a break.

Has this trick worked for you, or do you think it’s just clever marketing?

On one hand, the exams are finally over. On the other hand, the **ATAR results** are coming, and for many students, that feels like the big moment. The number you see on results day might shape your university options, scholarships, and in some cases, even your confidence about the future. But let’s clear something up straight away—it’s an important number, yes, but it’s not the final word on your future.

This guide breaks things down in plain language: when you’ll get your ATAR in 2025, how to check it, and what you can do after it lands in your hands.

**When Are ATAR Results Released in 2025?**

This is the first question every student asks. The exact date depends on where you live, but they’re all released in **December 2025**. A quick run-through:

* **New South Wales (NSW):** HSC results usually come in mid-December, and ATARs follow almost immediately.
* **Victoria (VIC):** VCE results and ATARs drop together, usually in the first or second week of December.
* **Queensland (QLD):** ATARs are published by QTAC, normally in mid-December.
* **Other states (SA, WA, TAS, ACT, NT):** Different days, but all within the same month.

If you’re the kind of person who likes certainty, check your state’s **Tertiary Admissions Centre (TAC)** website. They always publish the official dates well before December.

**How to Check Your ATAR**

On results morning, you’ll probably be half awake, coffee in hand, and refreshing your phone. Here are the main ways to get your score:

1. **Login online** – use your student ID and PIN/password on your TAC’s website.
2. **Email or SMS** – if you signed up for this, the results usually ping your inbox or phone quickly.
3. **Printed statements** – some schools still hand these out, but it’s less common now.

Tip: Have your login ready the night before. Sites can lag because thousands of students are checking at once.

**What Does an ATAR Actually Mean?**

Here’s where many students get tripped up. Your ATAR isn’t a percentage; it’s a **rank**. If you get, say, 82, that means you performed better than 82% of students in your age group.

Some key things worth keeping in mind:

* A “low” ATAR doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It just points to different entry routes.
* Universities have **bonus points (adjustment factors)** for things like regional location, special achievements, or hardship.
* Pathways exist. If you don’t meet a cut-off this time, there’s more than one way back into your dream course.

So, your ATAR is a tool, not a verdict.

**What to Do After You Receive Your ATAR**

Now comes the real decision-making. It can feel overwhelming, but let’s break it into simple steps.

**1. Compare Your Score with University Cut-Offs**

Every course has a cut-off ATAR. Some are high (like medicine or law). Others are lower or more flexible. If your score meets or exceeds the cut-off, great—you’re in the running.

**2. Change or Reorder Your Preferences**

Most states let you edit your preferences after the results are out. So, if you scored higher than expected, you might aim for a more competitive course. If you scored lower, no stress—you can swap in pathways or related programs.

**3. Explore Alternative Pathways**

Didn’t get what you hoped for? You’re not stuck. Plenty of students take other routes and still end up where they want. Some options:

* **Diplomas or TAFE courses** – later you can transfer into uni.
* **Foundation or bridging programs** – offered by many universities.
* **Gap year or work experience** – not wasted time, but a way to build skills before returning.

**4. Apply for Scholarships**

Scholarships aren’t just about the highest ATAR. Some reward leadership, volunteering, or financial need. Always check the university websites—you’d be surprised how many opportunities go unused simply because students don’t apply.

**5. Take Care of Yourself**

Results season can be emotional. Some students cry with joy, others feel flat, and many sit in between. All of those reactions are normal. Before rushing to change your whole life plan, take a breath. Talk it through with teachers, family, or even friends who are in the same boat.

**Questions Students Often Ask**

**1. What if my ATAR is lower than I wanted?**  
It happens more often than you think. Pathways, bridging courses, and adjustment points exist for this exact reason.

**2. Can I challenge or appeal my ATAR?**  
Not directly, because it’s based on scaling across the whole state. But in some states, you can request a review of exam papers or marks.

**3. Does a single number decide my whole future?**  
Not at all. It may open or close certain doors now, but plenty of students change degrees, transfer later, or succeed in careers unrelated to their ATAR.

**How to Stay Calm on Results Day**

Results day can be intense. Here are a few small things that help:

* **Don’t sit, hitting refresh every five seconds.** If the site crashes, it’ll come back. Your result isn’t going anywhere.
* **Think about both outcomes.** What if your score is higher? What if it’s lower? Having both plans ready takes away some panic.
* **Talk to someone who’s been through it.** Older siblings, cousins, or even teachers—they’ll remind you it’s survivable.

**The Takeaway**

Your ATAR is important, but it isn’t everything. Some of the most successful people didn’t get the top score; they took detours, changed their plans, and still ended up where they wanted.

So when the **ATAR Exam Results 2025** arrive, check your score, explore your options, and remember: there’s always more than one way forward.

The mantra starts looping in my head like a broken record: *‘Don’t mess this up, Jocelyn. You can’t afford to.’*

Triple salary.

The words dance in my vision like a mirage.

Enough for Mia’s treatment. Enough for the experimental therapy her doctors mentioned in hushed tones. Enough to maybe—*maybe*—keep my baby alive and healthy.

If I don’t faceplant again in the next five minutes.

“You’re the new assistant?” Patricia’s voice could freeze hell over and charge admission.

“That’s me. Professional disaster, at your service.” The sarcasm slips out before I can stop it, but I’m past caring.

A door *slams* behind Patricia’s desk, and the sound ricochets through the space like a gunshot.

Then *he* walks out, like he owns the world.

Broad shoulders that strain against a charcoal suit, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms that should be illegal. Hair that’s somewhere between gold and ash, perfectly tousled in that way that takes either professional styling or incredible genetics.

Phone pressed to his ear, voice cutting through the air like a blade: “I don’t give a damn what Shanghai thinks. Fire them. All of them. I want new contractors by morning.”

Then he turns and those eyes hit me like a freight train carrying a cargo load of holy shit.

Green like sea surface, like emeralds, like every cliché poets use when they’re trying to describe something indescribable. They’re sharp enough to cut glass and focused enough to dissect my soul in under three seconds.

Jesus Christ, he’s beautiful in that dangerous, untouchable way that makes smart girls do monumentally stupid things.

There’s something about him. Something that pulls at the edges of my memory like a half-forgotten dream. I know this face or maybe I’ve imagined it a thousand times.

The way he carries himself, that particular tilt of his head, even his presence feels achingly familiar.

The recognition hits like déjà vu mixed with pure, undiluted want.

“You’re late.” He ends his call with military precision, sliding the phone into his pocket without breaking eye contact.

“Sorry, traffic was—”

“I don’t want excuses. I want results and discipline.”

His voice hits different. Low, commanding, with an undertone that sends weird shivers down my spine for reasons I absolutely cannot and will not analyze right now.

“Right. Results and discipline. Got it.” My own voice sounds foreign, breathless in a way that makes me want to kick myself.

He’s already moving, all purpose and controlled energy. “Conference room. Cunningham files. Twenty minutes.”

“Which Cunningham files?”

He stops. Pivots. Those green eyes narrow to laser points that could probably bore holes through steel.

“The ones you should have reviewed instead of whatever kept you looking like you went ten rounds with a blender and lost spectacularly.”

Ouch. Direct hit to the ego.

“I was at the hospital—”

“Personal problems stay personal. This is business.”

Cold bastard. Beautiful, intimidating, completely heartless bastard.

The next eight hours are psychological torture disguised as employment.

Every order delivered like I’m an incompetent child who can’t be trusted with safety scissors. He criticizes my filing system, my coffee-making skills, my ability to transfer calls without hanging up on people.

Nothing I do meets his standards, which apparently exist somewhere in the stratosphere.

But I need this job. Mia needs this job.

So I swallow my pride, along with several creative profanities, and do whatever Zayden Wolfe demands. Even when my body keeps freaking out around him.

Something about him sets my nerves on fire, but I can’t figure out why.",1,1759488968.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

“Shit, shit, SHIT—”

The words tear from my throat like a battle cry. My heel catches the elevator threshold like it’s personally offended by my existence.

I’m airborne for exactly two seconds. Papers explode from my death grip like the world’s saddest confetti. My coffee launches across pristine marble flooring that probably costs more per square foot than I make in a month.

My dignity? Already dead and buried six feet under.

I hit that floor like a meteor strike, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear the universe laughing.

The secretary behind the massive desk looks like she’d rather call security than acknowledge my existence. Her nameplate gleams in gold letters: Patricia.

“Just… me versus physics. Physics won, I guess.” I’m hauling myself upright, while my hands won’t stop shaking, and it has nothing to do with the fall.

With increasing adoption and wider acceptance, crypto has now entered a new realm: everyday spending. One of the key innovations in this shift is the introduction of crypto cards, which enable users to use their digital assets in their daily lives just like traditional currency. These cards are an exciting development for those who want to seamlessly integrate their digital and traditional financial worlds.

Crypto cards offer a convenient and practical way to use your crypto holdings for routine purchases. Whether it's buying coffee, shopping online, or paying for travel, these cards convert your cryptocurrencies into the local currency at the point of sale. The best part is that many crypto cards offer near-instant conversion, ensuring a smooth transaction process without worrying about fluctuations in crypto prices.

One of the major benefits of using crypto cards is the ability to earn rewards, similar to traditional credit or debit cards. Many crypto cards offer cashback, crypto rewards, or even the opportunity to earn more crypto for purchases. This feature incentivizes users to spend while simultaneously growing their digital portfolios. Additionally, some crypto cards come with perks like travel insurance, concierge services, and exclusive deals, enhancing the overall experience for users.

Another advantage is the increased transparency and security crypto cards provide. Traditional banking systems have certain risks, including fraud and chargebacks, but cryptocurrency transactions are generally more secure due to blockchain technology. With a crypto card, you are empowered by the security and immutability of the blockchain, reducing the risks associated with traditional payment methods.

As more merchants begin to accept cryptocurrency, the usefulness of crypto cards continues to expand. These cards can be used worldwide, providing an easy way for crypto enthusiasts to tap into the global marketplace. With no need to worry about exchanging crypto into fiat currencies, users can experience the benefits of global spending without the hassle.

For those interested in making the most of their crypto holdings, the Redotpay referral code offers an opportunity to gain more benefits. By using this referral, users can access unique features and rewards that help enhance the overall crypto spending experience, unlocking further value from their digital assets.

In conclusion, crypto cards are transforming the way we think about money, making it easier than ever to spend digital assets in the real world. Whether you're an avid crypto user or new to the space, these cards offer flexibility, rewards, and security that enhance your financial freedom.",1,1759488769.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Long story short its the best coffee I've ever had but not something you would enjoy daily as its a bit out there and not necessarily what you would go for when you want a coffee. Great experience but maybe something you'd get once a month as a special treat. 

Went in the first day and the espresso machine was broken so the wife and I shared two pour overs from two different beans one iced and one cold. They were both incredible and we found it hard to believe it was actually coffee, tasted more like a flavoured tea. No idea how they're able to get these flavours.

We enjoyed it so much that we came back a couple days later and got a double espresso and an iced latte (wife's choice). Espresso was also amazing although with a lot less body than I'd typically enjoy, it was served as two separate shots which were prepared differently. The iced latte was also surprisingly good tasted very sweet and the espresso complimented the milk really well.

Overall I'd say if your in Japan its definitely worth checking out at least once but I wouldn't base an entire trip over it.",117,1759488626.0,espresso,25,0.94,False

My first ideas so far would be: getting an extendable coffee table, adding some plants, getting a bigger TV, placing my electric guitar in the corner of the room and using some sofa covers to change the color / adding some colorful pillows to spice up the colors. 
I’m completely new to the idea of interior  decorating so I’d also wish some guidance regarding how I should mix the color palette of stuff around. For example, I was thinking whether I should get a coffee table with the color dark brown, light brown or even white, or what color should the rug be? Should I get couch covers to change the color to something more interesting / appealing?

1nwvocx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nwvocx/hr_franklin_0_part_2/,[HR] - Franklin × 0 ÷ ∞ (Part 2),"Alright, I’m back! I’m the guy with the weird PC I dug up from the woods. Some exciting updates from my friend and I!

We finally managed to get into the blackbox, thanks to a PC workshop run by a kind old man named Mr. Koyukuk. Check him out, not sponsored. They gave us some general info on the materials from what they could gather. The glass and metal used were octuple layers of Panzerglass and Tungsten respectively, in fitting with my original hypothesis that this was some weird time capsule. I recognised both, one from my phone’s protective membrane, one from the trekking pole that started all this. This is probably why it took so long so crack it open in the first place.

We finally got into blackbox as well! There were two memory cards, one who's contents we haven't yet managed to transfer to a normal PC which Mr. Koyukuk suggested could hold the files used for this program the thing was running and one that we did manage to partially transfer to a normal PC which held an unfathomably long word log. 33 terabytes of just words. This thing practically zip bombed Mr. Koyukuk’s poor old PC, but through patience he managed to extract it all as a file that could be compressed and opened. Let’s just say it's really not what any of us were expecting. 

We'll try to keep working on it, Mr. Koyukuk agreed to halve his pay if it meant keeping the thing afterward and we agreed, at this rate I just wanna know the story of what happened here. Bellow’s a copy paste of all we managed to extract from the text file so far. As with last time I’ll update y’all as we manage to extract more of the files and will include as much on each update as I can. Until then.


“White. Snow.

Sticks. Trees.

Glass. Waterstained glass.

Something soft’s under my butt and on my spine. It’s a seat? Something elastic’s over my waist. Seatbelt. My elbow hurts slightly on something cold and hard, it's the window’s edge. I'm sitting in a bus, it feels weird to have given such a mundane situation this much though, as if my brain's processing it all bit by bit. My name is Wyatt Brooks. Duh, I mean I’m not the sharpest but damn I feel slow today. That thought calls out to an infinite number of other thoughts relating to myself, all dripping down along a ghostly chain anchored in my brain. It feels like the world and I are slowly being constructed from a cloud of concepts. My every thought is echoed after I think it, but slower, as if they're being written down. I really need to sleep.

I look to the seat next to me. It's a guy. My brain starts placing his features. Teenager, dark hair, blue eyes. Franklin. All thoughts relating to Franklin snake their way to my brain again. One of them overpowers everything. I have the biggest crush on Franklin. My body grows warm, thawing from the stuttery stupor I was in just moments earlier. The feeling of my dry sweatshirt brushing up against the hair on my chest and stomach and my parka brushing up against my dry sweatshirt stings me.

My brain’s caught up with my tired body. The noise in this bus hits me, dozens of boomboxes duking it out, it's the noise of a field trip. I was lucky to grab these two seats for me and Franklin on the back. We'll be staying at this hotel for just a day to see the Northern Lights at night then head back and hit a couple of national parks along the way. I don't remember anything they told us about it other than it was optional and it was Franklin who asked me to go, I would never have the courage to ask him. Right now we're surprisingly good friends, we’ve been this way since Fall, both freshmen and all. A lot of stuff has been implied by us both but neither of us have acted yet, we'd probably be a base farther down the line if my hormones would just behave, I regret. I hate the way I think of him sometimes, without clothes. I shouldn't think of him that way, not yet.

Bootclad footsteps click towards us, it's a friend. It's Abigail. Her dad's weathered old leather jacket hugs her like his ghost reaching down from Heaven, matching the black of her wolfcut. 

“Save a seat for me?”

She asks playfully. No. It took this much willpower to sign the waver that said I’d be sharing a room with Franklin, don't take this away from me, not now I think in the split second before I realize how polite it’d be.

“Sure.”

Franklin reassures her with a smile. His voice is like heroin. Bad thought, heroin is bad. I'm thinking too deeply about this, I like his voice and that's it. No, why do I like it?

“Wyatt?”

He acknowledged me.

“Yeah?”

I reply duly. I feel dumb. I should have said more.

“You good big guy? Sleep late”

Abigail’s jokey voice ruins the echo of Franklin’s acknowledgement of me. I’ve never hated her more. Bad thought, she's a good friend. Her smile drops a little after a bit of looking at my unflinchingly tired sleepless face. We had to wake up at 6 AM today to be picked up by the bus, now it's probably around 7:00, I calculate.

“Yeah Just tired.”

My voice sucks. It's deep but it's sickly. Not only now, always. Not like Franklin's. His is a rich rasp like black coffee. I want to feel it whispering on the back of my naked neck. Bad thought, stop it.

“You should probably go back to sleep.”

He nods at me. His smile shatters me. I want to cry, but I'm too tired.

“You're right. Night.”

I shift in my seat. I shut my eyes and head rests on the back of my hand as my elbow contorts painfully to sit on the edge of the window.

“Goodnight!”

He pats my shoulder. Stop. This is creepy, you're creepy, I'm creepy. My heart beats a violent tattoo of his name into my throat. What if they hear it? Stop.

“Damn, is he alright?”

I can hear Abigail whispering to him. “No”, I think to grumble from my nap. That would be funny, that would make him laugh. I love his laugh. Stop. Fuck. Stop.

“He’s always like that. Great guy, just needs to get like, 110% more shuteye?”

He whispers back and laughs. I want this fucking bus to swallow me whole. This corner is my rightful place, his voice torturing me while my eyes are forced to abstain from his face. When I hit puberty my dad warned me it would get melodramatic real quick, this is probably it. I slip back into this corner between asleep and awake, hopefully when I wake up we'll be there. A guilt springs within me. Guilt that my fear is keeping me from happiness, this ride is probably gonna be so fun for him and Astrid. Come on, sleep.

The frost on the window bites at the pinkish tip of my nose. My eyes creak open. It's definitely morning, my body feels slightly better so I must have slept. But the sky shows little signs of time’s marching. This weird echoing in my brain’s still there, fine I guess I'm mentally ill now. I shoot a look behind me. She's still there, she's chatting with him. I should join.

“Had a good nap sleepyhead?”

He acknowledged me again. His tone is too kind.

“I think. What’d you two do?”

I try to add a little more briar to my voice, I I think I did good. But I can't think great right now.

“Kinda just talking about the hotel. I looked it up, five whole stars. They got a sauna too.”

Abigail pricks at me. I try to steer the topic into cloudy weather, I need to get more comfortable around Franklin. Ever since I started feeling this way towards him it feels like our friendship’s grown too distant, if I want to take this further I should close that gap.

“What's the woods around the hotel look like? It's not in a town or city, right?”

I ask Abigail.

“It’s pretty plain honestly, just snowfields and the occasional birch. And you're right it's more like a natural retreat, there's a town in like two hours.""

This is an amount of talking I’m happy with for now.

“You guys wanna go check it out? It's not much from what Abigail showed me but you look like you could use the fresh air.”

Wyatt gestures to me. I process this far better than I would have four hours ago.

“Great idea.”

I give him the nicest smile I can. He smiles back, his eyes join his mouth. It's genuine. A towering hotel scrolls into the view outside my window as the bus takes a pivot and drives towards it.

“Alot bigger than in the photos.”

Abigail jumps in. It's a strange building. There's no Christmas decorations. It's just a white wooden tower with a roof and windows. Like outsider art of a hotel’s growing pains as it turns into a sanitarium. The bus stops abruptly, the engine shutting down as the doors open and other kids rush to get out. I can still hear the noise of the engine from that same part of my brain where all my thoughts are echoing from.

“Dude?”

Franklin taps my shoulder. Was I thinking that long? He’s holding out my luggage to me. I grab it quickly in embarrassment and thank him. Almost too quickly I worry, he looks to have been knocked a little off balance. We march outside. Abigail's leather boots carve a safe path for me and Franklin’s weak little canvas sneakers. We’re quickly herded into the front door, cloaked in shadow under a stone terrace. The lobby is bathed in a blue and green glow dripping from the tinted windows, it's weirdly serene in place of the almost Foucaultist, sterile pale lighting most hotels opt for. The rocky paleo decor digs up a joke about what Björk’s bathroom probably looks like and I burst out laughing in it's memory despite my best try at suppressing it. Apparently it's infectious.

“What's so funny?”

Franklin looks up at me curiously, a shaky laugh under his voice. I forgot how much taller I am than him. I wanna ruffle his black hair so much. Oh stop, you were doing great.

“I’ll tell you later.”

I shut my laughter up with one last chortle. I’ve been told I have a bony laugh. I let that insecurity flow away, it's not annoying to Franklin and Abigail. That's all that matters. Quickly we’re given our keys and sent up to our rooms with our keys, my basketball coach letting us all know when to gather for lunch. The corridor walls are cosily dark, a black that hugs you in how tight it makes a space look. The carpet on our shoes is snow white, the manager must have some absolutely unholy beef with the cleaning ladies. The door to our room greets us as we ascend the strairs.

“Call me when you're done, loseeers…”

Abigail breaks us up and gestures a phone call, disappearing behind a corner.

“...Sorry!”

She bumps into a girl coming the other way. Franklin gives a faint laugh, then pulls his key from the pocket and twists the lock open. I like the way his hands move. Our room is alot tinier than I thought, I didn't really look into it. The walls are that same comfortable black as the halls, painted on squared stone, thought the effect is somewhat ruined by the whole eastern wall being a window. Two beds. Bittersweet.

“You wanna unpack later? I don't feel like staying in my room all morning.”

Yeah.”

“You don't like it?”

My attempt at banter comes out a bit too sincere.

“Oh no, it's nice and all. I just wanna go see the tundra is all.”

He cranes his neck wistfully to the window. I feel weirdly okay with how close we are right now. He always put his one foot above his knee when he sits. Oh, right.

“You should switch shoes, mine are still soaked from the snow. Do you have boots with you?”

I ask, trying to sound thoughtful. If I really love him should it not have come to me to say that naturally? I don't have time to figure out what came to me naturally, his mouth’s opening to talk.

“Aw, no. I guess I didn't think we’d go out at all.”

My brain racks itself. I can't just not go on a romantic walk in the tundra with him.

“You can borrow mine.”

When I first got those boots on my birthday we immediately went for coffee afterwards and I forgot them at our table. When I rushed back to get them one of the baristas was jokingly asking who the sasquatch was who forgot his new kicks. I don't know what Franklin's shoe size is but it's probably smaller than US 14.

“Sorry I forgot, they may be too big for you.”

I try to cushion my folly before it lands.

“Well it's better than nothing.”

I try to not look as rushed as I am while looking for the boots. I toss out technical books and freshly washed clothes and packs of cigarettes until I finally reach the bottom of my backpack, pulling out a platic Kwik Trip bag with the two boots caught in it and throwing it to Franklin.

“Thanks!”

His smile reaches his pretty blue eyes.

“I should go freshen up. I'll be in the bathroom.”

I get up quickly, almost spilling the contents of my backpack to the ground.

“I won't be long.”

I rush into the bathroom and shut the door behind me with more force than I meant to. Fuck. This probably looks so bad. I don't have time for that though.

The bathroom, ironically, is the part of the hotel that reminds me the least of that joke about Björk's bathroom. The tall square mirror at the heart of it reflects me. I can't go out like this. My thin face looks crushed, my curly bed hair’s only gotten worse from my nap in the bus, my glasses are sliding off my hooked nose from all the cold sweat. In the silence, I realize the the roar of the engine still echoes in the back of my brain. Fuck. I frantically take off my clothes, they smell like my nicotine addiction. I need a shower. Cold water? Cold water is best right now, yeah. I need all the energy I can get. I climb in and turn the dial to the coldest it can go. The freezing water prickles my skin, drowning out the engine’s echo. My every pore screaming I am alive, I want to be alive. This is all just social stress, hang in there Wyatt. One day, you’ll look back at this stay and smile. You’ll think, this is weekend I finally told the love of my life.

“FUCK!”

I wail. The engine’s echo ignites into a violent revving. A pixelated voice laughs in my brain. I instinctively cover my ears, slipping in the shower and hitting my ribs on the porcelain floor. The stream of cold water from above anchors me. The pixelated voice dissolves into an unfathomably loud crying. It's so crunched it sounds like a snuff film involving a chainsaw blasting out of a thousand out of sync Ataris.

“TURN OFF COMMUNICATION.”

The crying shifts sharply into a clear but deafening utterance of those three words. Both echoes cut off with an abruptness that leaves my brain hurting infinitely more than both did. I burst into tears from the pain.

“Wyatt?!”

I muster the strength in my throat to yell at him before he opens the door.

“DON'T COME IN! PLEASE!”

I can't let him see me like this. I sit like this for minutes, letting the water wash the pain from my body. After all the shampoo dissolves from my hair, I try my best to get up. Surprisingly, I can. I grab the towel from the sink and pat myself dry, then wrap it around my head and trying to scramble my scalp awake like hitting a hamster in a sock against a wall. What the fuck was that? I have no time for doctors right now, but I need one and soon. I let out the heaviest sigh I've ever let out and wrap the towel around my waist. Yeah, this’ll make me look confident. I exit the bathroom. Franklin looks at me, his eyes drowned in worry.

“I slipped, it's nothing.”

I laugh it off. My ribs flare with pain.

“You sure dude? You look hurt.”

I look down at my chest where a blue bruise is spreading like a texture loading in. It's not nothing. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker in the cold we’re about to head into.

“Yeah. Let me just get dressed.”

I’d be worried about the pain showing in my voice if the cigarettes hadn't already made it sound like that. I grab the warmest clothes I can find and rush back into the bathroom, this time taking care to not close the door like it owes me money. I'm gaining my humor back, that's good.

I slip on a black sweater and a pair of gray jeans. The water droplets on my torso soak into the fabric as they coat me.  Now for the hard part, putting on socks with wet feet. Don't rip. Don't rip. Don't rip. Alright, good. I don't have the time to tie my shoelaces, I tuck them in the sides of my sneakers. I violently stuff my arms into my parka like an alien parasite and rush out the bathroom. He's sitting on his bed, taking out clothes from his bag. He looks at me, there's still a little concern in his eyes.

“Ready?”

He grabs his Walkman and a pair of headphones. A tape of that weird British band’s album with the square face on the cover is lying on his bed.

“Yeah, let's go.”

I quickly walk up to the door and open it, making sure to let him pass first before following him into the hallway.

“Ack, sorry I…”

He takes a bit. I should ask if I can help.

“What’s wrong?”

Good job and bonus points for the worried tone.

“Nothing, I just didn't put on enough clothes for this weather I realize.”

Oh my God. I'm gonna get to give him my parka.

“You can borrow my parka if you want, I'll be okay with just this.”

I pick at my maillike sweater.

“You sure?”

He asks, as per social law of being offered anything for free.

“Yeah, you only have a shirt and a jacket. You'll turn into a frozen TV dinner out there.”

He gives me a smile. He does that alot actually, is it just the stay he’s excited for?

“Thank you, Wyatt.”

He could've just said “Thanks.” but he didn't. He said my name. As we climb down the stairs I see the same lobby we stood in just an hour earlier, polished wood and rock in all shades of black and white and gray. It all feels like a corner in a cabin’s attic.

“I’m gonna go to the bathroom real quick. Abigail should be here soon, just texted her.”

I watch as be walks into a white hallway off the side of the front desk, turning around after I realise how weird I'm being. 

I should sit on the couch, it’ll make me look less like his lapdog. It's quite stiff despite looking like a giant plushie. I sprawl my arms around it to look cool for when he comes out the bathroom. I should ask if there’s an infirmary or something in this place, I gotta get checked for whatever happened in the bathroom. I know sleep deprivation, that was not that. An accented voice whistles at me.

“Hi.”

It's a guy sitting on the other couch. He's pretty fit and wearing only a tank top and shorts. Clearly not local, he sounds English.

“Um, hi.”

His cologne reaches me all the way here. It's so acidic. Fuck do I not wanna talk to this person.

“What's up?”

He's really going for it. Fuck.

“Look, I'm not interested. I have a guy I’m actually interested in meaningfully. I don't need to fuck around like this.”

I puff my chest and try to sound as strong as possible. My bruise strings.

“‘Ave you ever even tried it? You don't look it.”

He scoffs smugly.

“Fuck off.”

I get up and look for a better place to sit. This guy has guts I’ll give him that, this is a public space.

“You’re not fooling anyone, mate. You could just once if you wanna be so pure or whatever, you know? “Get it out the system.” sort of deal.”

A tiny part of my brain stops and thinks about this. That part is insane, stop. How could you even give this thought? Familiar bootsteps echo in the lobby, muffled by white carpet.

“What's up?”

Abigail sits down beside me, wrapping an arm around my shoulder. She's wearing her leather jacket properly now, still open for style points.

“Nothing, let's go.”

I raise my neck and get up. I hear footsteps coming from the hallway the bathroom was in, thank fuck. The English sex pest scoffs at me again as Franklin comes up to me and Abigail. He checks his watch.

“We have two hours ‘till lunch. I think that should be good.”

In almost lockstep we all walk out the revolving front door. This space between the lobby and the Alaskan wilderness feels oddly comfy. Abigail pulls the door knob open and a wall of still frost rains down on my freshly showered hair. It creeps it's way under my parka and in between the weaving of my sweater, cooling the wet deodorant in my armpits. Right. I take off my parka and hand it to Franklin.

“Almost forgot. Here you go.”

He quickly coats himself in it as we step out the front road and turn to the tundra. It's at least three sizes too big.

“Thanks again.”

This is nice. It feels like what I was robbed of during that shower. Quiet. My sneakers are getting absolutely soaked in the snow, but that's ok. I’ll let them dry near a radiator later. Woken up by the cold, my brain lets all the thoughts of all the things in the world around me flow through it, not filtering them out in fear of overheating, not rushing to get to safety anymore. This is safety. I look at both of them next to me, the tiredness still droopping from their eyes but not polluting their bright faces. The deeper we walk into the tundra the blurrier the white sky looks, rendering all life under it in a dreamy slow motion. I can almost hear the trees’ biorhythm whirring around us like song. It sounds a little like the engine I was hearing earlier. Fuck, stop it.

I hear the clicking of plastic. Franklin’s fiddling with his Walkman, clipping it to the chest of his shirt under his parka. Well, my parka.

“I only brought one album, sorry. Not very fitting for with this scenery either, thought I don't listen to much that would be.”

He jokes at us. I catch a knowing look on Abigail's face as she glances at the tape in Franklin's hands.

“Those guys? I'm not that depressed yet.”

She scoffs. I wait for Franklin's response to see if I should actually laugh or not. Maybe I am a lapdog.

“They have some happier songs too. It's not all about Bela Lugosi being dead. One of them on this album reminds me a lot of you.”

He smiles at her too. It's so damn infectious.

“She's in paaarties~”

I hum, clinging onto the conversation as the gloomy track starts up. Distorted bass breaks up the silence and accents my every footstep with an electronic dot. I try to catch up with their brisk pace, I walk slow despite my tall stride length. The trees around us hack the world up like pencil lines on paper. My dad came from a broken home and he always told me to enjoy these years as much as I could. I get it now. No matter what happens after graduation, this one fixed point in time existed when we were all happy together. Intangible but immortal proof that these three people once cared for one another.

“Save. Turn off communication.”

I twist my neck in confusion. It whispered from my brain again, that voice from the shower. It wasn’t insane sounding like earlier, it sounded deflated. It sounded like all of dad's friends who warn me from experience to smoke less.

“What's with you today?”

Franklin shoots a weirded look at me, then Abigail. His curiosity overpowers his concern.

“I just need a good sleep. I’ve slept six hours in two days and my motor instincts are all fucked.”

I brush it off. Please don't be weirded out.

“Should we…go back? We can come out here again tomorrow when you feel better.”

I straighten my spine and try my best to look at healthy as I can.

“No, really. I'm good.”

My voice comes out way clearer. That's good.

“If you're sure. By the way, I haven't forgotten about what happened in the lobby. What were you laughing about?”

He stretches while he asks this, glancing back at our footsteps and turning fully around.

“Oh we're real far.”

He checks his watch. It looks so nice on him, what with the spotted white clock and black strap.

“We got ten minutes to lunch.”

He shoots a scaredy look at Abigail. She shoots a triumphant look back.

“Abby, don't. If not for me for Wyatt, he's a walking corpse right now.”

It's strange how awful those words would sound out of anyone else's mouth.

“Alright, you win nerds. No racing.”

She puts her hands up, folding them up behind her head as we walk back to the hotel. I needed this.

“We haven't forgotten jokester.”

Abigail taps my shoulder quickly.

“Oh right. Well it's just the decor in the lobby reminded me of this joke. Looking back it's kinda stupid.”

I humbly abstain from telling it right away.

“Let's hear it!”

Yes, thank you Abigail.

“I think it was “Getting lost hiking in Europe is not knowing if you've just stepped into WEF’s evil hideout, a post Soviet playground or Björk's bathroom.”

Abigail chuckles just a little, but Franklin folds in half, howling with laughter. He laughs so breathily, like a dog whining with joy.

“Alright that was good.”

It's my favorite sound in the whole world.With one last forlon step in thsnow, I push open the revolving door to the lobby. All the water squeezing out of my sneakers with every step suddenly threatens to send me sliding onto the shiny rock floor. I take it as slow as I can, finally reaching the carpet on the stairs.

“Lunch is down in the lobby, big guy.”

Abigail calls to me from under the stairs.

“I should really sleep, eating beforehand ruins your body's ability to heal itself. Save some snacks for me in a napkin and we'll meet at dinner.”

I smile and wave at both of them, and they both smile and wave at me as I take my leave. I remember mom's dating advice that bordered on political games, “Make yourself unavailable. Your time should feel like a luxury.” 

It's more than that cheap trick though, I do genuinely need a good sleep. Eight hours from now will be night, but not too late in the night. Maybe I could take him somewhere, Abigail mentioned a sauna. I scramble for my key in my jeans’ pocket and twists open the doorknob to me and Franklin’s room.

I quickly dress down to my briefs, take off my shoes and prop them up against the radiator, stuff my socks in them, and put on whatever shirt I have that's most pyjamalike. I jump into bed. My half awake body buries itself under the sheets with animalistic instinct, alaying. I want to shut my eyes immediately, but a thought swims up into my brain. That English guy at the lobby. All my worst parts hold a council to consider his offer. Stop it. Why am I constantly fighting my brain today? I wish it was that voice again, it just gives me headaches. This is something awful, a corruption of the purest thing in my life, my love of Franklin. It's so infinitely much more than what that English guy's offering and I know it, but in the comfort of the freshly cleaned hotel sheets the thought refuses to die. Stop. Stop. Stop…""",1,1759488282.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Originally from Chicago, lived in Paris for 7 years, and now based in Lausanne. Even though it’s going on two years that I’ve been here, I haven’t really had the chance to make friends. Not gonna get into the heavy, but the transition from Paris to Lausanne had some grave unfortunates. Happily, things are now *immensely better* and I finally have the mental bandwidth and time to socially grow.

I thought I’d make a post that’s a bit more detailed and specific, because while it’s nice to meet people for coffee or go on hikes through apps like GoSocial, it would be so much better if someone read this and thought: *“Oh! I like doing that (or want to do that) too.*

I’d like to meet **creative people** — people who like to make, learn, and experiment.

**Things I do or am curious about:**

* I want to try **classes:** pottery, dance, art — anything hands-on and creative. Anyone seen those art and wine sessions?
* I’m into **photography:** I'm no pro but I'm the guy who tends to take amazing shots of other people but always end up looking like a bit deformed when it’s my turn.
* I want to get back into **reading:** open to most, but love fantasy.
* I’m teaching myself **HTML/CSS**: Tinkering with webdesign and curious about app development.
* **MUSIC:** I’ve got a **guitar and keyboard** at home-- still a beginner, emphasis on *trying to*, but it’d be great to fumble through chords with someone else.
* **Cooking:** Love to cook, love to eat-- I’ve even done a **cooking livestream**, which was honestly a lot of fun.

And yes, I enjoy the classics too:

* **Hikes, travel, exploring**
* **Long walks around the city** (one of my favorite simple joys).

It probably looks like I’ve got my hands in a bit of everything. And maybe that’s true — but it comes less from being scattered and more from having spent a long stretch isolated. What I want now is simple: to share these things with others. Less “coffee chats,” more *actually doing things together* — creating, learning, experimenting.

If any of this resonates, I’d be happy to connect. Maybe first a coffee — but then why not music, co-kitchen cooking, or trading a book we both read? A class, a walk, a photo project, a jam… the idea is to put real energy into something together. Show me your creative side, I’ll share mine, and let’s see what we can build.

Salut à tous,

*tout d'abord— je précise que je parle français presque* ***C1***  *Donc pas de souci pour papoter en français.*

Je viens de Chicago, j’ai vécu 7 ans à Paris, et maintenant je suis basé à Lausanne. Même si ça fait presque deux ans que je suis ici, je n’ai pas vraiment eu l’occasion de me faire des amis. Je ne vais pas rentrer dans les détails lourds, mais la transition Paris → Lausanne a été marquée par quelques graves galères. Heureusement, aujourd’hui ça va *beaucoup mieux* et j’ai enfin l’énergie et l’espace mental pour élargir mon cercle social.

J’ai pensé écrire un post un peu plus détaillé et précis, parce que même si c’est sympa de rencontrer des gens pour un café ou de faire des randos via GoSocial, ce serait tellement mieux que quelqu’un lise ceci et se dise : *« Ah ! Moi aussi j’aime faire ça (ou j’aimerais essayer) ! »*

# Choses que je fais ou qui m’intriguent :

* **Cours créatifs** : poterie, danse, dessin/peinture — tout ce qui est manuel et créatif. Quelqu’un a déjà testé ces evenements “d'art et vin” ?
* **Photographie** : je ne suis pas pro, mais je suis le gars qui réussit à prendre des super photos des autres et qui finit toujours un peu *déformé* quand c’est à mon tour 😅.
* **Lecture** : j’aimerais m’y remettre sérieusement. Ouvert à beaucoup de genres, mais j’ai un faible pour la fantasy.
* **HTML/CSS** : j’apprends en solo. Je bidouille un peu le webdesign et je suis curieux de l’univers du développement d’applications ioS.
* **Musique** : j’ai une guitare et un clavier à la maison — toujours débutant (emphase sur *débutant*), mais ce serait cool de bricoler quelques accords avec quelqu’un.
* **Cuisine** : j’adore cuisiner et j’adore manger — j’ai même fait un livestream culinaire une fois, franchement fun !

Bien sûr, j’aime aussi les choses plus classiques :

* **Randonnées, voyages, découvertes**
* **Balades en ville** (une de mes choses préférées, toute simple).

Oui, on dirait que je touche à tout. Mais ce n’est pas parce que je suis dispersé — c’est surtout parce que j’ai été assez isolé depuis mon arrivée. Maintenant, j’ai envie de **partager** ces activités avec d’autres. Pour moi, ce n’est pas juste “prendre un café”, mais vraiment *faire des choses ensemble* : créer, apprendre, partager des projets, s’amuser.

Si tout ça te parle, ce serait avec plaisir de se connecter. Que ce soit un cours, une balade, un projet photo, une session musique ou même un livre qu’on lit en commun — l’idée est de partager une expérience où chacun apporte son énergie. J’aimerais aussi découvrir ton côté créatif, et pourquoi pas collaborer.",6,1759487832.0,Lausanne,1,1.0,False

The 50% tariffs imposed on US imports from Brazil have led to a sharp drawdown in ICE coffee inventories, a bullish factor for coffee prices.  ICE-monitored arabica inventories fell to a 1.5-year low of 563,351 bags on Wednesday, and ICE robusta coffee inventories fell to a 2.25-month low of 6,450 lots.  American buyers are voiding new contracts for purchases of Brazilian coffee beans due to the 50% tariffs imposed on US imports from Brazil, thereby tightening US supplies, as about a third of America's unroasted coffee comes from Brazil.

Let's call her Marie. We were just catching up since it had been a while since we last hang out, taking sips from out drinks from time to time, when suddenly a man approached us. He had some kleenex packs on his hand, trying to sell them.

Man: Hey, girls, you want some kleenex? There's a virus going around.

Me and Marie: No, thank you, sir, we're good.

Man: Come on, girls, one of them is just twenty cents.

Me: Sorry, I don't have any coins on me (which was true, by the way).

Man: Can you at least invite me to a coffee, then?

That's where we froze. The desk we were sitting at had four seats, like the rest of the desks out. We definitely didn't want this stranger to sit with us, so, a bit surprised, we stayed silent and avoided eye contact.

Man: Come on, girls, please? It's cold and it doesn't cost anything out of the kindness of your heart.

First of all, it wasn't cold, it was 25° Celsius. Second of all, was he trying to guilt trip us into giving him a cup of coffee for free?

Man: I hardly have anything and I'd really like a cup of coffee.

He kept on insisting for a while. We were pretty uncomfortable, so Marie decided to just ignore him. She asked me whether I had a picture of my partner to see what she looked like. I took the hint and took my phone to search for a picture. Finally, after a few seconds, the man grumbled under his breath and walked away, saying something about ""ungrateful and impolite brats"".

I have been a naturist/nudist for several years. In the summer I seek out FKK beaches and prefer nude swimming.

A few years ago I moved into a new apartment, where I also have a small garden - a backyard.

I gradually applied my nudist lifestyle to outdoor activities. At first it was just drinking coffee on the terrace, later sunbathing and now I am at the point where I go to mow the garden and take care of the garden naked.

My house consists of several apartments and I have about 6-8 neighbors who can see me in the garden. On both sides my neighboring gardens are separated only by a low transparent fence (1.2m).

A kind of symbiosis has developed with the neighbors, where they have no problem with my nudity and at the same time I try not to limit them with my naked presence.

For example, if someone has a visitor in their garden or is doing something there, I have no need to go naked in the garden. At the same time, if I am naked in the garden and a neighbor comes to my garden, he has no problem talking to me and discussing common neighborhood topics, regardless of the fact that I am naked and he is dressed...

I like the non-violent dynamic that has led to this state where the neighbors accept my nudist lifestyle. At the same time, it includes a consensus that my nudity does not lead to sexualized nudity.

I've spent years on both sides of the fence (QA and now dev), and I've been thinking a lot about the whole ""AI is coming for our jobs"" narrative, especially in testing. After using it extensively as a daily tool, I don't think it's a simple replacement story. It's a story about specialization.

I wanted to break down my honest thoughts on where I see AI already winning, and where I'm convinced humans will always have the edge.

\*\*Where AI Already Beats a Human QA:\*\*

\* \*\*Speed & Scale:\*\* This is the obvious one. An AI can parse 100,000 lines of logs in seconds to find an anomaly that a human would miss or spend hours looking for. It can generate a thousand unique user data sets while I'm still brewing my coffee.

\* \*\*Pattern Recognition:\*\* It's incredibly good at spotting patterns in massive datasets. For example, it can identify that a certain API endpoint fails most often when a specific combination of three optional parameters is used—something a human might never notice.

\* \*\*Mind-numbing Routine:\*\* Let's be honest, we all hate it. Writing boilerplate for automation scripts, structuring test cases, rephrasing a bug report for the 10th time... AI is perfect for this robotic work.

\*\*Where a Human QA Will (Probably) Always Win:\*\*

\* \*\*Business Context & Critical Thinking:\*\* An AI can verify if a button works. It cannot understand \*why\* that button is critical for Q4 revenue goals, or why its placement is terrible for the user journey. A human can prioritize testing based on business impact.

\* \*\*Empathy & User Experience (UX):\*\* An AI can't \*feel\* that an animation is janky and annoying, or that the wording on an error message is confusing for a non-technical user. This requires empathy.

\* \*\*Intuition & Exploratory Testing:\*\* This is the magic of QA. The ""what if I click this three times, then turn my phone upside down?"" moments. AI follows logic and patterns; humans follow curiosity and intuition. This is how the most bizarre and critical bugs are often found.

\* \*\*Communication & Politics:\*\* Convincing a Product Manager to delay a release, explaining a complex bug to a frustrated developer, navigating team dynamics. These are deeply human skills.

\*\*My takeaway:\*\*

AI isn't our competitor; it's the most powerful tool we've ever been given. It's taking over the 'robot' parts of our job, which forces us (and allows us) to be better at the 'human' parts: being more creative, more empathetic, and more critical thinkers.

This is just my two cents from my journey. What do you all think? \*\*What's another area where human intuition in testing will always beat a machine?\*\*",0,1759487406.0,softwaretesting,1,0.25,False

And I know that I can do a little tour with a local ferry as I have a public day ticket for transport. But I forgot which tram or bus to take to get there and what is the name/number of ferry. A 1 hour round trip would be appreciated.

I expect complete loyalty, consistent tributes, and emotional devotion. This is not a game. It is a ritual of worship, service, and growth.

I love praise, ownership, service, and soft control. I enjoy creating rituals that shape your devotion. Daily or scheduled tributes, like 3 pm “pay me for my day,” check-ins with to-do lists, writing lines or essays, and nicknames I choose for you are all part of how you will serve.

Good behavior is rewarded. You can earn photos, voice notes, and even phone calls if you prove yourself. Tribute is expected and tied to what you receive. The more consistent you are, the deeper you’re invited.

This is not humiliation. It is worship, service, and tending to my Garden of Eden.

🌻What I Like

• Consistent tributes (time-based offerings like 3 pm “pay me for my day”)
• Praise, ownership, service, and soft control
• Check-ins with to-do lists or progress updates
• Writing lines, essays, or reflections as tasks
• Nicknames and titles I choose for you
• Rituals, rules, and contracts
• Rewarding good behavior with photos, voice notes, or calls you earn

🖤 What You’ll Do

• Show financial consistency and emotional devotion
• Follow my rituals and tasks with care
• Ask for permission, check in, and respect boundaries
• Earn access and rewards through loyalty and generosity
• Tend to my Garden of Eden and keep it thriving

🌱First Instruction

☕ Visit my Throne Wishlist and buy me a coffee.
📸 Send me a DM with screenshot proof once it’s done.

That is how you begin. Tribute first, then access.
