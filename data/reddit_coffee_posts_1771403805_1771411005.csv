For the past few months, my Cousin Louise (aka PCL or Poo Covered Lou) has been claiming we “stole” 20 Fly Buys rewards points from her.

For those who are unfamiliar, Fly Buys are a rewards system run by a major Australian supermarket. You can earn rewards points on your grocery shopping, and they have these kitchenware items that you can get at the checkout for Fly Buys points. I don’t actually have a Fly Buys card\*, so my knowledge is limited. But Auntie Dot and Cousin Louise have a shared family account\*\*, and Auntie Dot loves her Fly Buys kitchenware. 

Our Great Fly Buys Heist took place a few months ago. There was some offer where you could get a lidded measuring jug for 20 Fly Buys points (I think) and if you spent a certain amount. At the time, I didn’t really pay much attention because I wasn’t expecting it to turn into crime of the century. 

From memory, Auntie Dot was feeling a bit unwell at the time, so Martin drove her to the supermarket and helped her with her shopping, including one of these Fly Buys jugs. On the way home, Auntie Dot said she thought her friend Joan would really love one of these. So Martin offered to use her rewards card, and get another jug when we did our top-up shop, so she wouldn’t have to go out again. 

Auntie Dot said “Yes”, and a couple of days later, Martin dropped the rewards card and another measuring jug around to her. Auntie Dot and her friend Joan were both happy, and Martin temporarily basked in the glow of his good deed. But then PCL noticed the missing rewards points, and when Auntie Dot explained, PCL only heard that Martin used the card. And in her mind, he’d “stolen” the points. 

When Auntie Dot was feeling better, she went out and got another one of those lidded measuring jugs and gave it to Martin as a “thank you”. All PCL believed was Martin had used the rewards card, and “stolen” the points to buy this measuring jug. The Great Fly Buys Heist was complete. 

Now I’m going to have to be a bit vague about this bit, because it is ongoing. Since late last year, there have been some concerns with Ms Wonderkid’s school. Both Martin and I have relevant professional knowledge, and we shared our knowledge to help them navigate the situation. Or rather, PCL would ring up and ask for help, but then not listen to anything we said because she would just trauma dump. So I gave Auntie Dot a lot of information about support for Ms Wonderkid, and Martin spent hours with Mr Cousin Louise, helping him plan for meetings. 

With the new academic year, the old pain points have flared up again, and Ms Wonderkid has a new diagnosis. So on Sunday, Martin and I went round to Cousin Louise’s to talk some more. 

It… did not go well. PCL wanted me to do something unethical, that would likely get me deregistered. I said no. PCL exploded and said I was being selfish, and I never did anything to help her family. Then she kitchen sinked the bit about us “stealing” 20 of her rewards points. 

The mention of the Great Fly Buys Heist is what made Martin get angry at PCL. Now Martin is usually an easy-going kind of bloke, so I think even PCL was shocked when he narrowed his eyes and lips and started listing every bit of help we’d already given her in his most icily methodical tone. 

Then we left. But not for good. On the drive home, Martin said we should give her the measuring jug, so she could finally shut up about those expletive Fly Buys points. I agreed, then asked how many coffee pods she’d given us. Martin said there were 19 (I knew he’d have counted them). I asked if we could stop at Coles on the way back to Louise’s with the jug. 

I got two ten-packs of the cheapest coffee pods I could find, and I got decaf. And I got one of those plastic bags from the fruit and veg section. In the car on the way, I emptied the coffee pods into the plastic bag and tied the top. I briefly considered removing the extra coffee pod, but decided that was her interest.  

You probably know where this is going. We went back to Cousin Louise’s. PCL answered the door and assumed we were back to do what she’d asked. Martin said no, and gave her the measuring jug and said this was what her rewards points bought, and now things were even. Then I handed over the bag of coffee pods, and said these were her coffee pods back, so she couldn’t say we’d stolen those too. 

Then we left again. And when we got home the final time, we hadActually, trick question, I made both.  a slice of the gluten free, soy free and dairy free orange marmalade cake I’d made the day before. It was delicious. 

BTW, Happy Valentine’s Day for the fourteenth, and World Hippo Day for the fifteenth for those of you who celebrated. 

\* I am chronically unable to keep track of rewards cards. I even lose those coffee cards (buy 10 coffees, get the eleventh coffee free), after about five coffees.

\*\*When I first came back to Australia, I considered getting a Fly Buys card for myself, and linking it to their family account. But when Cousin Louise started listing all the rewards she would get using the rewards points I would be contributing, I decided it was a low priority.  ",1,1771410745.0,u_HokeyPokeyGuestList,0,1.0,False

1r7zikm,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1r7zikm/24f_advice_needed/,24F Advice Needed,"Hi. Please do not judge me.

I went to college for 6 years. I started a little before the pandemic, I was 17. My parents signed me up for all of the loans. I have an undergraduate degree, graduate degree (required to my graduate degree), and a 22k loan for rent. 

I live with my fiance (M26) and we are halfway done paying for our wedding. We are going to finish paying for it because we payed more than what we owe for the most part. He has no student loan debt. We have an old car with no plans of getting a new one and we do not want kids. Jointly we make about 82k a year and I am expecting a raise. 

I was paying off my 36k in debt and I kept getting emails that I did not pay.

I called, confused. The nice lady on the phone explained to me that I have 2 different loan servicers and owe them an additional 76k with the combined total of 1.2k/month, minimum. Apparently I can consolidate the loans and apply for income-driven payments. For context, we don't live above our means. My vices are a Starbucks drink to get me through the day but I also make coffee from home. We don't go on vacation, we don't go out.  We don't really want a honeymoon. 

We recently got accepted to a new house which is 1.5k/month. And I was so proud I didn't need a cosigner. It feels really adult to me.

My plan is to do that and use the avalanche method. Pay credit cards first. We have 2, one with 260 and one with 2.7k. Then tackle the smaller loan which is about 3.4k.

I wanted to know if I am cooked. I saw a comment on a debt subreddit that said some people buy houses and cars every few years and the value depreciates but your education will not. I work in healthcare and I can always find a job. 

IDK if there are any parents out here on this subreddit but I could really use a hug. It feels daunting and I feel so stupid because I genuinely did not know I had like 8 loans out and I was only paying for 2. ",1,1771410680.0,debtfree,0,1.0,False

someone would ask about my week and my brain would go completely empty. not shy, not anxious. just... nothing there. i'd do this thing where i'd smile and go ""oh you know, same old same old"" and then immediately feel like a ghost. like i exist but leave no mark on any conversation.

i'd watch other people pull stories out of nowhere. the funny thing at the grocery store. the weird thought on their commute. the random thing their coworker said. and i'd sit there thinking... do things not happen to me? am i moving through life without actually experiencing any of it?

spoiler: things were happening. i just wasn't catching them.

so a few months ago i started doing two small things, mostly out of desperation if i'm honest:

1. a story bank. a note on my phone where i dump anything that happens, anything i noticed, anything that made me smile or go ""huh."" saw something weird on my walk. heard a random fact that stuck. got unreasonably annoyed at something and then laughed about it an hour later. just little things. the bar is genuinely very low. i write maybe 2-3 lines a day, sometimes less.
2. a conversation log. after talking to people i jot down what worked, what flopped, what i wish i'd said. more like debriefing with myself than anything formal. you start noticing patterns. certain topics always land. others kill the energy instantly. you stop feeling so unprepared.

now here's the thing. i haven't magically transformed into someone with endless things to say. i want to be real about that.

but last week someone asked me ""so what have you been up to"" and i actually had three things ready in my head before i even opened my mouth. i picked one. told a tiny story about something dumb that happened at a coffee shop. nothing special. they laughed. we kept talking.

that was new for me.

it's not a dramatic change. it's more like... finally finding your keys. they were always somewhere in the house. you just needed a system.

still figuring this out. been documenting everything i read and try along the way, mostly for myself, but i drop it all on my profile as i go if anyone wants to follow the process in real time.

    That was me. Every single week without fail.
    
    
    
    Renting a spot in Rathmines with the missus and the baby. Between the night feeds, the nappies, and trying to remember which colour bin goes out on which week - bin day just kept catching me off guard. Twice in a row the black bin was full to the brim because I'd missed collection. Landlord wasn't delighted.
    
    
    
    One night during a 3am feed I googled ""bin day reminder app ireland"" and there was genuinely nothing that worked properly. The council websites are a maze, none of the providers have decent apps, and setting calendar reminders for alternating weeks is a pain in the ****.
    
    
    
    So I taught myself to code and built one.
    
    
    
    **What it does:**
    - Tells you the night before and the morning of collection (so you actually remember)
    - AI waste scanner - point your camera at something and it tells you which bin it goes in (deadly for stuff like pizza boxes or tetrapaks that nobody's sure about)
    - Works with Panda, Greyhound, Thorntons, City Bin and most of the other providers
    - Syncs to your calendar and Siri if you want it to
    - Free. No ads. No subscriptions. No selling your data. Some upgraded stuff to pay for if you fancy it, less than a coffee. 
    
    
    
    I'm not a developer and I'm definitely not trying to build some big startup. Just a knackered dad who got sick of missing bin day and figured if I have this problem, loads of other people probably do too.
    
    
    
    Built it over the last few months during nap times and after the baby goes down. First thing I've ever coded. It's not perfect but it works and I'm improving it all the time.
    
    
    
    binday.ie if anyone wants to give it a go - works on your phone browser, no download needed.
    
    
    
    Would genuinely love to hear what ye think. What would make it better? What am I missing? and more than likely, what doesn't work!
    
    
    
    Happy to answer any questions about the app, thanks a mill,

At this point, I don’t know if I am in love or just stuck. Things have become toxic, confusing, and emotionally exhausting. I keep going back, hoping it will get better, but it never really does. I need clarity and I don’t know if I am doing the right thing by staying.

She has ADHD and is autistic, and I’m somewhat autistic too.

In the beginning, I was cautious. I didn’t fully trust her because I had been hurt in the past and assumed she was like others. Early on, she told me some guys had invited her to a fun fair. Since we were already talking, I told her not to go. She ended up not going with anyone, and eventually we moved in together just four months into dating.

At the time, I was working and thought we were building something solid. But had a big argument with my mum, and ended up staying full time at my girlfriend’s house and then I lost my job. That’s when things began to fall apart. We started fighting more, and because it was her place, she would kick me out during arguments. I would stay outside. I stayed calm most of the time, but she would hit me, throw things at me, and spit on me. I didn’t fight back at first. I just wanted peace.

When things got bad, I tried to take my things, but she refused to give them back saying I lost access to them. Still, we got back together. The pattern repeated over and over. She once cut herself with a knife during an argument and also cut me. I had to go to the hospital. I told my mum, then collected all my things and left. But we still got back together again. By then the relationship had changed. I still had no job, but I was trying my best. She worked remotely and supported me for a while. I was very grateful for that because I would have done the same for her.

Eventually, I found a job at a restaurant. I tried to help with money, contribute to food, take care of her dog, and save where I could. But we still argued a lot. She said I wasn’t helping enough. I tried to explain that our lives were mixed now and we needed to cut costs. I never tried to control her money, but I wanted us to be practical. Despite everything, when she got upset, I would still be kicked out of the house. I lost count of how many times I packed my things and left.

Later on, we moved into a new place, and this time my name was on the lease. But again, I couldn’t afford the deposit as I had just lost another job. She covered it. We were still struggling, but somehow there was always money for weed, which we used together. She continued to support me and I appreciated it deeply. But even when I gave her some of my money or bought food for both of us, it never felt like enough to her. She told me she was the only woman who would do this for me and that she regretted it.

Arguments continued. When she was upset, she said things that really cut deep. One time she told me I hadn’t taught her anything and that I brought nothing to the table. At some point, everything that had happened to me being hit, spat on I started doing the same to her during fights. It became toxic on both sides. She would slap me and I would slap her back. I’m not proud of it, and it scared me how far we had fallen us both, I guess she was too.

There were also moments that really disturbed me same with her. I’m not someone who shows big emotions easily. I would freeze while she was crying and she never let me forget it. I explained that I struggle to respond in those moments, but I promised to work on it. I really tried. Our sex life was very intense and very frequent. She liked touching me all the time and at first it made me uncomfortable, but I got used to it and now we touch each other a lot.

However, there were two separate times where we ended up having sex while she was sleeping. I genuinely thought she was awake, as we sometimes initiated things half-asleep. We spoke about it, and I understood how serious it was. But it happened again later and I still thought she was awake. I was devastated because I never wanted to hurt her and I didn’t think it was against her will. But the trust was breaking down. I swore on the Bible that I would never do anything like that again.

She began calling me narcissistic and other names and during arguments i would call her names too. I recognised some toxic traits in myself but I also saw them in her. I kept thinking love meant going through highs and lows, but this felt extreme. She kept my keys during arguments so I couldn’t come back. She would tell me to leave the house and then expect me to sit in a coffee shop and apologise like nothing had happened. That messed with my head so much and I guess her head too.

At one point, I got a storage unit to protect my things since I kept getting kicked out. I still paid rent even when I couldn’t use all the space in the house. She would say I wasn’t doing enough. She told me I couldn’t use the office room because I had left it messy once when I packed up after an argument. I didn’t even know where to go in the house anymore.

We argued again recently because of my aftershave. She had a migraine and said the scent triggered her. I told her I could wipe it off. I tried to open the windows to air out the room but she told me to close them and to leave the room. I left the living room and went to the bedroom. She came and said I couldn’t be there in the bed because I would sweat on it and her cleaner had just cleaned the house. She said she didn’t want me to sweat on the bed. I left the room, but she followed and said I still needed to go to the office instead. The argument escalated. I tried to remove some food my mum had made from the freezer because she said it was too full, and she got upset again. Then she slapped me. I warned her before not to hit me again or I would react, and this time I did. I slapped her back. She dropped to the floor and I panicked. I helped her to the sofa and said I was sorry. Then I left.

As I was heading to my storage unit, she called and said I had her credit cards, which I did. We agreed I would leave them in the letterbox. Then she told me her brother wanted to speak with me and also with my parents. She started demanding money I had been saving for our Japan trip, which I had offered to use to help us both. She said if we are not together, she would change the passenger name on the ticket as she paid for it in full. She also said her mum was on the phone with my mum, crying, and that they were arguing. I called my mum and she said she never spoke to her. Then my girlfriend tried to merge the call with my mum. I was being manipulated and guilt-tripped. I started joking and said sure, my mum will send you eight hundred pounds, just to see her reaction. It all felt so fake and dramatic.

She had returned the birthday gifts I gave her recently, and now she is asking for the laptop she gave me a year ago. I’m tired. We are acting out of pain and pride. It has become tit for tat, and everything is now about what we owe each other instead of what we once felt.

Weeks ago she started talking about wanting to get married and said she wanted us to grow together. She said she wanted to get engaged in 2026. I just don’t see how that would be possible.

But I'm quitting ladies and gentlemen. I need to pee 😂 i have to eat. I have to cook. Im still gonna use the marsipo to carry her when fussy but she needs a quite nap and I can't give it to her anymore. She's getting more alert by the day so me just reaching gently to grab my coffee disrupts her sleep. And I miss reading a good book here and there. I'm not gonna do the ""cry it out"" method. What i did today and worked was putting her semi awake-asleep in her crib. Put lullabies. When fussy I pat her. Never pick her up unless crying. She slept... not long! But she slept! Usually I take her out on a stroll and she sleeps for 3 hours top. But today the weather was shit..and I have a terrible headache. So I was like...sleeping on our own from now own dearest.
Im still gonna contact nap her during the early hours of morning after her last feed. But that's it.
I had a friend come over yesterday for a coffee. She wouldn't settle at all, neither in my arms or her crib. so he had to leave. That's when I knew its time. What about your experiences?",2,1771409787.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

I have never in 41 years come across this problem.

After the pandemic, I bought this refillable mug, because the old one died.

It holds a large coffee.

At every Timmie's I go to charges me $ 2.15 for a cup of joe, 10 cents cheaper because they don't have to use their cup.

Today that all changed, I was at the Timmie's at Union Station to get my morning cup of joe, the barista that served me said the cost was $ 2.20, I immediately asked why the price had gone up.

Their reply was that it had always been this price at this location.

I asked her for the cost of other sizes, she said it was all up on the board, and proceeded to provide me my joe, which I gave the extra nickel for.

After I had written down all the prices for various sizes, I left to check them out at another location.

I found that all four sizes of coffee were 5 cents more.

Given that Timmie's Union location probably has 1,000's of customers every day that adds up to a lot of extra money for the manager.

How are they getting away with this?

I was always under the impression that management set the prices for everything so there is consistency across the network.

Who can this be reported to?

1r7z6sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r7z6sq/how_to_tell_if_someones_actually_into_you_5/,How to Tell if Someone's Actually Into You: 5 Psychology-Backed Signs That Don't Lie,"Okay, so you're wondering if that person is into you. Maybe they're a coworker, a friend, or someone you just met. You're analyzing every little interaction like it's a crime scene, trying to decode what the hell is going on. I get it. Attraction is confusing as hell because people rarely just come out and say it.



Here's the thing though: attraction leaves breadcrumbs. And I'm not talking about the obvious stuff everyone already knows (like prolonged eye contact or touching their hair). I've gone deep into research from psychology, body language experts, and evolutionary biology to figure out the \*\*subtle, sneaky signs\*\* that actually reveal when someone's attracted to you. This isn't guesswork. This is science mixed with real-world observation.



Let's break it down.



\## Step 1: They Mirror Your Body Language (Unconsciously)



This one's fascinating because it happens \*\*without them even realizing it\*\*. When someone's attracted to you, their brain goes into rapport-building mode. They subconsciously start copying your movements, your posture, even the way you talk.



If you lean forward, they lean forward. If you cross your legs, they might cross theirs a few seconds later. If you use certain phrases or speaking patterns, suddenly they're using them too. This is called \*\*mirroring\*\*, and it's rooted in our primal wiring. We mirror people we like because it creates connection and trust.



Pay attention next time you're talking to them. Are they subtly matching your energy and movements? That's not a coincidence. That's their brain screaming, ""I want to connect with you.""



\*\*The science:\*\* A study published in \*Social Psychological and Personality Science\* found that people unconsciously mimic those they're romantically interested in as a way to build rapport and attraction.



\## Step 2: Their Pupils Dilate When They Look At You



Alright, this one sounds weird, but stick with me. When we're attracted to someone, our pupils literally get bigger. It's an involuntary response tied to arousal and interest. Your brain releases dopamine (the feel-good chemical), and boom, your pupils expand.



Obviously, you can't just stare into someone's eyes like a psycho to check their pupil size. But if you're in conversation and notice their eyes look a little wider, a little more engaged, that's a physiological giveaway. Their body is betraying their attraction.



\*\*The science:\*\* Research from the University of Chicago found that pupil dilation is directly linked to sexual interest and emotional arousal. It's one of the most honest signals because you can't fake it.



\*\*Bonus insight:\*\* This is why dim lighting works so well on dates. Your pupils naturally dilate in low light, which makes you appear more attractive to the other person. Sneaky, right?



\## Step 3: They Find Excuses to Be Near You (The Proximity Test)



This one's subtle but powerful. If someone's attracted to you, they'll find ways to be in your orbit. Not in a creepy stalker way, but in a \*\*""coincidentally"" running into you\*\* kind of way.



Maybe they start showing up to the same coffee shop you go to. Maybe they linger after meetings when you're still in the room. Maybe they position themselves near you at group hangouts, even when there's tons of space elsewhere. They're gravitating toward you like a magnet because being close to you feels good.



Psychologists call this the \*\*proximity effect\*\*. The more time we spend around someone, the more likely we are to develop feelings for them. But here's the kicker: when someone's already attracted, they actively create opportunities for proximity.



\*\*Real talk:\*\* I noticed this with someone I was into a while back. Suddenly, they were ""just happening"" to be at the gym at the same time as me, or grabbing lunch when I was grabbing lunch. It wasn't random. They were engineering chances to be around me.



\## Step 4: They Remember Random Details About You



When someone's attracted to you, they're paying \*\*way more attention\*\* than you think. They remember that offhand comment you made three weeks ago about your favorite band. They ask about that work project you mentioned in passing. They notice when you get a haircut or wear something new.



Why? Because you matter to them. When we're interested in someone, our brain prioritizes information about them. It's like you become their favorite subject to study. Meanwhile, they might forget what they had for breakfast, but they remember your dog's name and your childhood fear of clowns.



\*\*The psychology:\*\* According to relationship expert Dr. John Gottman, attentiveness and remembering small details are core components of romantic interest. It shows emotional investment.



If someone's recalling tiny things you've said, they're not just being polite. They're filing away intel because you're on their mind.



\## Step 5: They Get Nervous or Fidgety Around You



This one throws people off because we assume attraction makes someone smooth and confident. Nope. Often, attraction makes people \*\*awkward as hell\*\*.



If they're into you, they might fidget with their hands, play with their phone, adjust their clothes, or touch their face more than usual. They might stumble over their words or laugh a little too hard at something that wasn't that funny. This isn't because they're uninterested, it's because they're \*\*nervous about screwing up\*\* in front of you.



When we're attracted to someone, our stress hormones (like cortisol) spike a bit. We want to impress them, so we get self-conscious. That nervous energy has to go somewhere, and it usually shows up as fidgeting or slightly awkward behavior.



\*\*Book rec:\*\* If you want to go even deeper into body language and attraction cues, check out \*What Every BODY is Saying\* by Joe Navarro, a former FBI agent. This book breaks down nonverbal communication in a way that'll make you feel like a mind reader. Navarro spent decades analyzing human behavior for the FBI, and he applies those same techniques to everyday interactions. Insanely good read. Best body language book I've ever read, hands down. You'll start noticing things about people you never saw before.



If you're looking for a more personalized way to dive into these topics without dedicating hours to reading, there's BeFreed. It's an AI-powered learning app that pulls insights from books like Navarro's, relationship psychology research, and expert interviews on dating and attraction, then turns them into personalized audio content. 



You can set a goal like ""learn practical psychology tricks to read attraction signals better"" and it'll build you a custom learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are honestly addictive, I went with the smoky, slightly sarcastic one. Perfect for commutes or gym sessions when you want to actually absorb useful stuff instead of zoning out. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content's legit and science-backed.



\*\*Another solid resource:\*\* The podcast \*Where Should We Begin?\* by Esther Perel dives into the complexities of attraction, relationships, and human connection. She's a world-renowned psychotherapist, and listening to her break down real couples' dynamics will give you a whole new perspective on how attraction actually works in messy, real-life situations.



\## Putting It All Together



Attraction isn't always loud. Sometimes it whispers through small, subtle behaviors that are easy to miss if you're not paying attention. Mirroring, pupil dilation, proximity-seeking, remembering details, nervous fidgeting, these are the breadcrumbs.



But here's the reality check: even if someone shows all these signs, it doesn't guarantee they're head-over-heels for you. Humans are complicated. Context matters. Maybe they're naturally friendly or just good at making people feel valued. The key is to look for \*\*clusters of behavior\*\*, not just one isolated sign.



And honestly? If you're unsure, sometimes the best move is just to take a small risk and express interest yourself. Life's too short to spend it overanalyzing every interaction.



At the end of the day, attraction is part science, part art, and part just seeing what happens when you put yourself out there.",1,1771409522.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

1r7z41u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1r7z41u/my_land_wont_stop_bleeding_pt_2/,My Land Won't Stop Bleeding Pt. 2," So because of some support on my last post here, I thought I’d come back pretty quick with another story about my property. Let’s see last time I told you about the eastern part of my property and the fates of those poor old workers, and I forgot to clarify some stuff. 

 First off I’m twenty-three now, so I’ve been here for quite a few years at this point. 

 Second off; the wild-life here is actually fairly normal despite all the strange happenings, though I’ll say they try to stick closer to my house than the woods where they should be. Not that I’m gonna complain, it’s kinda nice to have a few baby deer running around my little yard, it helps make everything just a lil’ more bearable.

 Finally no, there isn’t any burial grounds here, nothing buried here dies so nothing gets buried here.

 Anyways, about that totem, wait, hang on, do you even know what a totem is? Like the literal definition?

 It doesn’t matter all that much, you’ll see soon enough. So let’s take everything back to when I was around twenty, this was about a year after the whole Blood Tower incident (check the last post), and I had somewhat recovered mentally, though the curtains to my bedroom window had been permaneantly nailed shut and I intend for them to stay that way.

 Sorry, sorry, getting off track, the Totem, lemme tell you it’s history first. There’s this small town called Little Hope about ten miles off from my house, in it is this little diner I like to eat at when it mists just a little. So one day I was sitting in this cozy red booth, just looking out the blurry windows as the cars drove by, the smell of fresh coffee and bacon lingered in the air, and the only noise was the main waitress talking to some old man at the counter along with clinking plates from the kitchen.

 That’s why she startled me.

 I’ll try to write a little of our conversation, but I can’t remember all of it.

 The woman slid into the booth across from me, wavy auburn hair, green eyes, she looked a good bit older than me, maybe around late thirties or forties. Really the only distinguishing mark on the Woman I came to know as Amy was the vertile slight scar on the center of her forehead, it was oddly straight, surgical almost. Anyways she was dressed for the weather, a bright red coat with these beautiful set of ruby ear-rings that must have cost a fortune. 

 With a smile that could’ve turned the sky blue again, she spoke, her southern accent a scoche lighter than mine, “Hi there darlin’, you the new owner of the Old Davie Place?” 

 Naturally my isolation made me… a little unaccustomed to speaking, “Uhm… I don’t know?”

 She smiled a little wider, “My mistake, the Davie Place is inbetween those tree farms, it’s where the uh, those workers went missing a year ago.”

 A cold shiver ran down my spine, suddenly wondering if there were rumors floating around Woodsbury, “Oh, oh yeah, I own the property, why?”

 This is where I went wrong, the question shouldn’t have been ‘why?’ It shouldve been, ‘how do you know I own the property?’ But I digress, it was her next words that really put me off, “Did the owner tell you about what was west of the house?”

 “No, we really didn’t talk much after I handed him the cash.”

 With an apologetic look she reached across the table to try and take my hand, and my hand left the hot cup of coffee I had been holding onto. She looked a little hurt and her smile faded, but put both her hands in her lap and said, “Well you’ve been saddled with… something. Davie never really talked about it much, but tch, one time when I went over to ask him about some deer guts I found on my side of the fence, he looked scared as all hell. Kept rambling on about how ‘the demon to the west’.”

 Of course you can understand my concern, “What?!”

 Immediately her smile returned and it was like she saw that someone else had finally felt the same thing she felt, “Exactly! Anyways he told me to tell the next owner to ‘check under the porch’ come fall, and seeing as its fall I’d advise you to get home and do just that. Gotta keep the ‘demon’ in check am I right?”

 She said it like a joke and started to get up, before I stood with her, “Excuse me Ms uhm…”

 “Amy, just call me Amy.”

 “Amy, right. Did he tell you anything else? And you said on your side of the fence, you live next to me?”

 With a wave of her hand, Amy said in that bright tone, “Oh no, that was pretty much all he told me. But as for your second question, yes I do, I’ll come over and visit some time, you should really try my chili.”

 Then she left, and I felt the biggest bolt of dread in my life, not from the invite, no, it was from the ‘thing under the porch’. But still, after getting some sausage and eggs to go, I got back in my truck and started the drive back to my house. 

 When I got up to the gate, I didn’t unlock and undo the chain like usual to get in, I just stared. You could see my house from the gate, even if only barely through the tall grass and trees. The faded blue paint made the pitch black windows seem even more imposing, voids imposed upon reality, and under the wood, under the stairs leading up to my porch.

 There was something under them, and I had been sleeping over it for a year now. 

 Do you know how fucking stupid I am? What kind of idiot actually considers leaning down to look under the porch? What kind of an idiot would cram himself into a dark wet space, no, ignore the supernatural stuff, ignore the flesh tower, who would cram themselves into a place that was hard to escape if something living was under there, even if it was just a snake?

 Sorry, letting my emotions get the best of me, but I did crawl under there. 

 After parking in front of the house I noticed there was a hole in the wooden netting under the porch, to be honest I’m not totally sure if it was there when I left this morning, I didn’t really care either.

 I’m really tired, have I mentioned that? I’m tired now, I was really tired then, it had taken me a while to block out what happened to those workers. One of them was this really nice guy named Liam and… it’s hard to become friends with someone and then they’re just gone the next day, no resolution or ending just… I’m sorry I won’t get off-topic again. 

 I got out of the truck, and bent down, tilting my head to peer into the hole, just wet dirt and worms, hate worms. My phone’s flashlight was both just enough to see a good bit ahead of me, and just bad enough to not be any real comfort. Then without giving it another thought, I crammed myself into the space under the porch, feeling the wood scrape against the sides of my stomach.

 All the sounds of nature faded, replaced by the dull hum of silence, the ground under me was wet and every few seconds of dragging myself forward I would swipe in front of me and get rid of a swath of cobwebs, hoping that nothing would crawl up my arms. 

 Finally I think I found what Amy had told me about, placed perfectly upright in the center of the space under the porch… was a small shoebox. I rolled onto my back to get a little more comfortable, strangely enough I felt safe down there, like I’d found the one place in the world where nothing could find me. I slid the top of the box off, tipping the contents onto the ground.

 There was a folded up piece of index paper, and a map of the property, and after aligning the old map, I saw there was a small unassuming patch of trees circled in red sharpie, and the note read.

 ‘When the land’s cycle starts to end, pay your respects to the land. Give it flesh, or it will take yours.’

 Then in the room above me

 *Thump*

 Something had fallen in the living room, that’s what I thought, that’s what I prayed, instinctively I froze.

 *Thump, thump, thump, thump.* 

 Steps going back, towards the kitchen, towards the backdoor.

 *Creak.*

 My eyes grew wet and stung with tears, I bit my bottom lip, doing everything I could to keep from crying. Something hadn’t fallen, someone had run across my living room and just opened the backdoor. I blinked through the tears, and bent my head back as far as it would go, my neck hurting from how far I craned it. 

 Through the slits in the wood I could see two legs lowering onto the ground, not like they were stepping, but like they had floated down from the air, both of them were this horrible mess of sinew, like someone had heard humans had red muscle under their skin, and someone had just thrown strands of red together to try to imitate it. They stood there for a second, faced away from me, before they rose up and promptly began to float north in a straight line.

 I didn’t breathe again until finally it disappeared into the forest at the edge of the clearing. 

 It was a few more minutes until I dragged myself out of the space, wiping off all the grime from myself. It felt like crawling out of a grave, dirt staining my sweater and jeans, worms writhing on me, cobwebs covering my phone and hands. 

 Then I just sat down, taking deep, shuddering breaths. 

 Flesh, right, I needed to give flesh, that was a goal to focus on, and at the time that’s all I wanted, a goal to focus on. 

 So I went to the front door and opened it, not thinking about what I had heard just minutes before. There was a crimson stain on the ceiling of my living room, and on the ground there were bare, bloody footprints on the ground, a sixth toe wedged in the center of each print like some mutant cousin to humanity had just ran through the place where I ate my dinner.

It wasn’t just that, the air reeked of copper, like being submerged in a swamp made of pennies, I remember muttering, “God it reeks in here.”

 The backdoor was wide open, and when I went to grab the handle to pull it closed, my hand was stuck for a moment before pulling away. It wasn’t like regular blood, it was like sludge, pulling away from the brass doorknob in thick strands that I could meld like puddy.

 But even that wasn’t the strangest thing, it was the feather, I found this stark white feather on the ground that reflected light like a proud lion preening at the attention, making everything else dull around it. Even though it was as clean as a cherished dove, it didn’t feel good to hold it, it felt wrong. 

 So I burnt it in the fireplace, after all, I had to find flesh. 

 Luckily it hadn’t been a super long time since I’d been grocery shopping, so I had a few sealed packages of ground beef, and since the note hadn’t specified if the flesh had to be fresh, I hoped this would do. Then I began the walk to the western front of my property.

 And after shoving my way through thick branches and brush, feeling like a conquistador on the edge of a damned El Dorado, I found It in a clearing only big enough to contain the Totem. 

 Looming over me and all the trees was a man made of straw and twigs, thick and utterly featureless sat cross-legged on the dry earth. From the right hand protruded only two fingers, they were pointing up, and from the left hand also protruded two fingers, though they were pointing down. Laid in front of the Man of Straw and Twig, was the skeletons of several women. The dresses they wore were old, really, really old, and they had these bonnets like those old paintings of the pilgrims. 

 But looking back it was so weird, I mean any kind of pilgrim from England having gone this far west? There wasn’t any record of it, none that I could find anyways. The air felt really still around it, so still and silent that it felt uncomfortable, well maybe silence wasn’t quite the right way to put it, but the closer I got to this effigy, the louder this weird hum got.

 The best way I can put it is this, ever have a boss or a teacher tell you they wanna talk to you alone? They take you to some office, or they take you out in the hallway, and it feels like there was just this deafening aura around the both of you, and the lines of the conversation were so defined that when one stopped the other was invited to speak without any interruption. That’s what it felt like to stand under it, except there wasn’t any conversation, just the well-defined pause inbetween.

 My hands shook as they peeled off the ground beef’s plastic wrap, I know it sounds weird but I kept expecting it to talk or give me orders. But it never did, and in less than a minute I dumped the ground beef right in front of the bodies of the pilgrims. I would’ve expected the earth to swalow up all the raw beef… that or me. 

 But nothing happened, however, that silent presence that hung in the air dissipated. 

 May sound anti-climactic, but that’s kind of the end of that story, every year or so I bring some kind of semi-fresh beef out to the statue, one moment there’s a presence, and the next second there isn’t.

 Anyways uhm, that’s it when it comes to the western part of my Property. I might take a break from posting for a few more days, something up here is goin’ wrong and I need to take some time off to look into some stuff in town. This is Hallmund Mack signing out, thanks for reading.

1r7z3i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serieshorrorstories/comments/1r7z3i0/my_land_wont_stop_bleeding_pt_2/,My Land Won't Stop Bleeding Pt. 2," So because of some support on my last post here, I thought I’d come back pretty quick with another story about my property. Let’s see last time I told you about the eastern part of my property and the fates of those poor old workers, and I forgot to clarify some stuff. 

 First off I’m twenty-three now, so I’ve been here for quite a few years at this point. 

 Second off; the wild-life here is actually fairly normal despite all the strange happenings, though I’ll say they try to stick closer to my house than the woods where they should be. Not that I’m gonna complain, it’s kinda nice to have a few baby deer running around my little yard, it helps make everything just a lil’ more bearable.

 Finally no, there isn’t any burial grounds here, nothing buried here dies so nothing gets buried here.

 Anyways, about that totem, wait, hang on, do you even know what a totem is? Like the literal definition?

 It doesn’t matter all that much, you’ll see soon enough. So let’s take everything back to when I was around twenty, this was about a year after the whole Blood Tower incident (check the last post), and I had somewhat recovered mentally, though the curtains to my bedroom window had been permaneantly nailed shut and I intend for them to stay that way.

 Sorry, sorry, getting off track, the Totem, lemme tell you it’s history first. There’s this small town called Little Hope about ten miles off from my house, in it is this little diner I like to eat at when it mists just a little. So one day I was sitting in this cozy red booth, just looking out the blurry windows as the cars drove by, the smell of fresh coffee and bacon lingered in the air, and the only noise was the main waitress talking to some old man at the counter along with clinking plates from the kitchen.

 That’s why she startled me.

 I’ll try to write a little of our conversation, but I can’t remember all of it.

 The woman slid into the booth across from me, wavy auburn hair, green eyes, she looked a good bit older than me, maybe around late thirties or forties. Really the only distinguishing mark on the Woman I came to know as Amy was the vertile slight scar on the center of her forehead, it was oddly straight, surgical almost. Anyways she was dressed for the weather, a bright red coat with these beautiful set of ruby ear-rings that must have cost a fortune. 

 With a smile that could’ve turned the sky blue again, she spoke, her southern accent a scoche lighter than mine, “Hi there darlin’, you the new owner of the Old Davie Place?” 

 Naturally my isolation made me… a little unaccustomed to speaking, “Uhm… I don’t know?”

 She smiled a little wider, “My mistake, the Davie Place is inbetween those tree farms, it’s where the uh, those workers went missing a year ago.”

 A cold shiver ran down my spine, suddenly wondering if there were rumors floating around Woodsbury, “Oh, oh yeah, I own the property, why?”

 This is where I went wrong, the question shouldn’t have been ‘why?’ It shouldve been, ‘how do you know I own the property?’ But I digress, it was her next words that really put me off, “Did the owner tell you about what was west of the house?”

 “No, we really didn’t talk much after I handed him the cash.”

 With an apologetic look she reached across the table to try and take my hand, and my hand left the hot cup of coffee I had been holding onto. She looked a little hurt and her smile faded, but put both her hands in her lap and said, “Well you’ve been saddled with… something. Davie never really talked about it much, but tch, one time when I went over to ask him about some deer guts I found on my side of the fence, he looked scared as all hell. Kept rambling on about how ‘the demon to the west’.”

 Of course you can understand my concern, “What?!”

 Immediately her smile returned and it was like she saw that someone else had finally felt the same thing she felt, “Exactly! Anyways he told me to tell the next owner to ‘check under the porch’ come fall, and seeing as its fall I’d advise you to get home and do just that. Gotta keep the ‘demon’ in check am I right?”

 She said it like a joke and started to get up, before I stood with her, “Excuse me Ms uhm…”

 “Amy, just call me Amy.”

 “Amy, right. Did he tell you anything else? And you said on your side of the fence, you live next to me?”

 With a wave of her hand, Amy said in that bright tone, “Oh no, that was pretty much all he told me. But as for your second question, yes I do, I’ll come over and visit some time, you should really try my chili.”

 Then she left, and I felt the biggest bolt of dread in my life, not from the invite, no, it was from the ‘thing under the porch’. But still, after getting some sausage and eggs to go, I got back in my truck and started the drive back to my house. 

 When I got up to the gate, I didn’t unlock and undo the chain like usual to get in, I just stared. You could see my house from the gate, even if only barely through the tall grass and trees. The faded blue paint made the pitch black windows seem even more imposing, voids imposed upon reality, and under the wood, under the stairs leading up to my porch.

 There was something under them, and I had been sleeping over it for a year now. 

 Do you know how fucking stupid I am? What kind of idiot actually considers leaning down to look under the porch? What kind of an idiot would cram himself into a dark wet space, no, ignore the supernatural stuff, ignore the flesh tower, who would cram themselves into a place that was hard to escape if something living was under there, even if it was just a snake?

 Sorry, letting my emotions get the best of me, but I did crawl under there. 

 After parking in front of the house I noticed there was a hole in the wooden netting under the porch, to be honest I’m not totally sure if it was there when I left this morning, I didn’t really care either.

 I’m really tired, have I mentioned that? I’m tired now, I was really tired then, it had taken me a while to block out what happened to those workers. One of them was this really nice guy named Liam and… it’s hard to become friends with someone and then they’re just gone the next day, no resolution or ending just… I’m sorry I won’t get off-topic again. 

 I got out of the truck, and bent down, tilting my head to peer into the hole, just wet dirt and worms, hate worms. My phone’s flashlight was both just enough to see a good bit ahead of me, and just bad enough to not be any real comfort. Then without giving it another thought, I crammed myself into the space under the porch, feeling the wood scrape against the sides of my stomach.

 All the sounds of nature faded, replaced by the dull hum of silence, the ground under me was wet and every few seconds of dragging myself forward I would swipe in front of me and get rid of a swath of cobwebs, hoping that nothing would crawl up my arms. 

 Finally I think I found what Amy had told me about, placed perfectly upright in the center of the space under the porch… was a small shoebox. I rolled onto my back to get a little more comfortable, strangely enough I felt safe down there, like I’d found the one place in the world where nothing could find me. I slid the top of the box off, tipping the contents onto the ground.

 There was a folded up piece of index paper, and a map of the property, and after aligning the old map, I saw there was a small unassuming patch of trees circled in red sharpie, and the note read.

 ‘When the land’s cycle starts to end, pay your respects to the land. Give it flesh, or it will take yours.’

 Then in the room above me

 Thump

 Something had fallen in the living room, that’s what I thought, that’s what I prayed, instinctively I froze.

 Thump, thump, thump, thump. 

 Steps going back, towards the kitchen, towards the backdoor.

 Creak.

 My eyes grew wet and stung with tears, I bit my bottom lip, doing everything I could to keep from crying. Something hadn’t fallen, someone had run across my living room and just opened the backdoor. I blinked through the tears, and bent my head back as far as it would go, my neck hurting from how far I craned it. 

 Through the slits in the wood I could see two legs lowering onto the ground, not like they were stepping, but like they had floated down from the air, both of them were this horrible mess of sinew, like someone had heard humans had red muscle under their skin, and someone had just thrown strands of red together to try to imitate it. They stood there for a second, faced away from me, before they rose up and promptly began to float north in a straight line.

 I didn’t breathe again until finally it disappeared into the forest at the edge of the clearing. 

 It was a few more minutes until I dragged myself out of the space, wiping off all the grime from myself. It felt like crawling out of a grave, dirt staining my sweater and jeans, worms writhing on me, cobwebs covering my phone and hands. 

 Then I just sat down, taking deep, shuddering breaths. 

 Flesh, right, I needed to give flesh, that was a goal to focus on, and at the time that’s all I wanted, a goal to focus on. 

 So I went to the front door and opened it, not thinking about what I had heard just minutes before. There was a crimson stain on the ceiling of my living room, and on the ground there were bare, bloody footprints on the ground, a sixth toe wedged in the center of each print like some mutant cousin to humanity had just ran through the place where I ate my dinner.

It wasn’t just that, the air reeked of copper, like being submerged in a swamp made of pennies, I remember muttering, “God it reeks in here.”

 The backdoor was wide open, and when I went to grab the handle to pull it closed, my hand was stuck for a moment before pulling away. It wasn’t like regular blood, it was like sludge, pulling away from the brass doorknob in thick strands that I could meld like puddy.

 But even that wasn’t the strangest thing, it was the feather, I found this stark white feather on the ground that reflected light like a proud lion preening at the attention, making everything else dull around it. Even though it was as clean as a cherished dove, it didn’t feel good to hold it, it felt wrong. 

 So I burnt it in the fireplace, after all, I had to find flesh. 

 Luckily it hadn’t been a super long time since I’d been grocery shopping, so I had a few sealed packages of ground beef, and since the note hadn’t specified if the flesh had to be fresh, I hoped this would do. Then I began the walk to the western front of my property.

1r7z0sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createwitharn/comments/1r7z0sa/urgently_seeking_advicehelp/,Urgently seeking advice/help,"So I have overstayed my visit visa for about a year... 

A little back story.. 

Im 20 years old, came to Dubai from India on a tourist/visit visa, I came here in hopes of getting or finding a job. 

I was promised by someone i had spoken to ON FACEBOOK for a painters job, not my field ofcourse but I just needed to leave India as i was raised in Oman and dont know anything about India, my family isuin Oman but i have lost contact with them as they didnt wanttme to work, but while i was 16 I got a job and wanted to work and slowly started an artificial jewelry business that was doing great, due to my family's anger they cancelled my visa and told me to ""do everything on my own"" So I was deported to a country that I had never visited before ""india"" As my father is from India, mother fromiindonesia, I had savings of about 10,000 AED which i used to apply for a freelance 2 year visa to Dubai since I should be over 21+ if i wanted my own visa in Oman, I spent over 6500 AED for a freelance visa which later found out that i had been scammed and the person who took the money blocked me. 

He sent me a fake visa and with that i had already booked my ticket and was in the airport, too late to turn back whilst in the airport itself I applied for a 1 monthDubaiV urgent visa and postponed my flight to a day later as i was promised visa in 24 hour, i started researching all over facebook since Facebook groups is how i used to get jobs in oman, i connected with someone who promised me a painters job and he was Providing accommodation plus food, i agreed though salary was 900 AED and 12 hour work, but he said if i can learn the work fast he'd even give me the 2 year visa. 

After staying in the airport for 24 hours as before i was staying in a lodge or bedspace in mumbai which i had already checked out of I finally  got my visit visa approved, i flew the same day and landed in Abu Dhabi airport, from where i took a shuttle bus of etihad airways to Dubai, a whole new place for me, whole new experience and i had only 1250 AED to sustain myself for the month. 

I directly spoke with the painter job guy on whatsapp and he sent me a location to go to, apparently accomodation was there and he said work will start in 2 days, I went there and saw 16 PEOPLE in one room, it shocked me, people were smoking in the room, drinking in the room and what not, i was traumatized, but i have to stay becauss i dont have alot of money, i dont know about bedspace system or partition system, nothing. 

I stayed there for 3 days and during that time j used to go out in the morning and wander in the malls try to give out my CV here and there and come back in the evening to night to sleep because of the amount of people and cigarettes and all i couldnt bear it. 

The 4th day i was woken up by someone in the room and was forced to rush to a car with a few more guys and go for work, upon reaching the work i realized its not the same ""painting job"" I signed up for we were at the world trade center and we needed to pick up heavy bricks and basically clean up the event, i texted the guy who brought me to that room and me told me that its not his work but someone elses who is probably staying in my room and i should probably get paid 60-80 AED the same night. 

But after the work they told me that yes its not his work its their own like a daily basis job (diyadi) or something and that they would pay me, but they didnt pay, 2 days more of no painting job and the guy also stopped replying to me, again they made me go to another job, i refused as i wanted payment but they said if you dont go then pack your things and leave, i had no place to go to, thats why i stayed and went for the work, again as usual they didnt pay me, that night i was researching about mobile phones on dubizzle and figured i have 1000 AED something i should just buy and sell phones, i spoke with a seller and negotiated a good phone, to pick up the next day, I had gone to sleep and the next day i wake up and i couldnt find my wallet, i searched everywhere and finally found it near the toiler with NO MONEY. ALL STOLEN. I was so heartbroken i didnt know what to do as the room had 16 people and no camera, i tried to ask everyone but no one knew anything. 

Then the same evening the electricity went out and we all were forced to sit in a car for a job, but still no payment, we were brought to abu dhabi where we were forced to work for  23 hours straight picking up heavy wooden furniture and assisting in assembling them. 

After that when we came back there was nk electriciry still and the person in charge who was bringing us to jobs told us he will do somethinh about the electriciry but did nothing and we had to sleep without ac or anything. 

Then all of a sudden after getting just 3 hours of sleep at around 6-7 am in the morning we were forced to evacuate the room becauss they apparently hadnt paid rent. 

The one who was incharge had a cousin who always wanted to talk to me, this guy told me he knows another place where we will get job and theyll pay in evening, we went their this was in hor al anz, we worked for a week, but no payment, i was forced to work becauss if i didnt then i wouldnt be able to have an accomodation, after a week one night while i was trying to sleep this ""cousin"" Who brought me there started touching me inappropriately, as we had to sleep on on bed both of us because there was no space for 2, at night he started trying to touch me and rubbing his ehm against me. I stayed quiet and just stood up and went to toilet, after that i never slept at night only 1-2 hours while we're at some site for work. 

Apparently this cousin has an elder brother whos an alcoholic and plays betting every night, this brothee of his was eating our money, because he was older thus cousin allowed it also, i found this out from the management of that bedspace or labour accomodation who gives us work. 

Now i explain clearly to this cousin that im not here for games i have about 5-10 days until my visa expires i need to go back or get a visa, he promised me he'd either pay to extend my visa or he would find a job for me as he has got contacts. But a day or 2 later cousin has a fight with his brother and his brother slaps ME???? and tells both of us to leave, i kept quiet as i dont want any scene and left, he came with me as well, now im homeless and broke, but this cousin says no issues hes got someone who will give us a place, we go there and again only 1 bed, this was in bur dubai, no work just accomodation, he feeds me lies big dreams that he'll get me a job in hotel management and i can work in burj al arab with good salary etc because i know english, but then again he tried to ehm yk 'touch' me, thats when i had haf enough and asked him not to as im not like that and i need a job i had about 5 days pending, he promised me that theres a job with good pay per day lets go there from tomorrow, we went at 12am at NIGHT to the job and i find out that its 'selling alcohol' illegally, there was this whole operation for that, and i refused, im a muslim, i would never, he was a muslim as well but then...idk, anyways, he forced me and pushed me, he wasnt taking no for an answer, so finally i told him ill only do like standing far, he told me to take a cycle and use it to transport the bottles, i agreed but as soon as i got that cycle i cycled back to the accomodation, took my things and ditched the cycle there and ran back to hor al anz, spoke with the same guy who gave us work earlier and told him to ONLY pay me becauss i neeeded to make the money for my ticket. 

I work there for about a week, but the issue is is that the money i was getting 60 AED and 10 minus for the bedspace means 50 AED PER DAY, which i eventually went into overstay, then this cousin guy returned and he tried to get close to me again which i refused and set a boundary after that a new guy came for the same work but this guy knew english, ill name him A so A seemed like a good educated guy, family was in Dubai just going through a small downfall, i became friends with A my first actual friend in dubai, or.... I thought, until thus happened. 

One day A told me i had cash and wanted to check my wallet (as a friend) to go and eat out which I denied that i had cash as i save each and every penny for my visa, tho overstay seemed crazy to clear but not impossible, i had around 4-500 aed in savings, and it was in my bag with my passport and all, so he checked and found nothing, then he asked me to check his wallet which i refused but he insisted and there he had 1500 AED so i told him if he wanted to eat out then why not spend from his pocket since... He hasaalot, right? But he said hes only in dubai becauss he is here for giving driving lessons while earning a few bucks he actually stays in Sharjah, i was like okay, thats fine, fast forward a week or 5 days later i had a job interview in JBR, i didnt know how to get there but i have google maps right? So I go, this was 2nd december UAEs national day and i went there in the morning, after the interview i sort of just stayed because i read in the news that there were fireworks and i just wanted to be at some peace. 

Apparently after waiting for 8 hours or so the fireworks was cancelled, and everyone there was ledt in disappointment, i take the metro back at around 9-10 pm and accidentally fall asleep, waking up and last stop centerpoint and I realize its 1 am and no metro back, i didnt know how to get a taxi and saw that my phone js also dead, so i decided to follow the sign boards by walk on the main road that led to hor al anz, i was near the airport crossing the road when a police from the other side of the airport fence called me, i came to the fence and he asked me questions, why am i here at this time? Its illegal to cross the road that way, what am i doing so late at night like this? Where is my passport? Where js my visa? I explain that my passport is in my bag in my room and my visa is on my phone but its dead, i am on overtsay but im resolving my issues, during the time amnesty was going on but i wasnt eligible for amnesty as i came on october, so he called another police guy and they put me in the car and brought me to the police station in the airporr, got my phone charged and checked my passport and visa, then they let me go, they strictly told me to keep my passport with me at all times, so as soon as i reached my room i opened my bag only to find out that the lock is broken and my smaller bag is gone, which contained all my documents, passport and cash, i asked everyone in the morning but no one knew anything. 

No one admitted no one said anything, just we dont know, the guy A was getting close to the Cousin guy so we kind of drifted apart too so i didnt talk to him as much, i asked him as well byt he replied with dont accuse me. 

2 days later he claims that his 1500 AED is stolen, he checks with everyone but somehow he kept on telling me if i have it just give it back but i didnt have it, I didnt know myself who took it as i was at work for morning shift then night shift and both in sharjah and only after coming back he told me that his money was lost, a day or 2 passed and he had come on my bed to comb his hair as i only have a mirror, so as a joke i pushed him to the side to push him i pushed him from his waist which i felt passport type book feeling, i tried to check but he wouldnt budge, he kept saying its important document of his etc. I kept insisting but he just walked out quickly and i didnt know where he went and when he came back, that wasnt with him, the next morning i went to muraqqabat police station to file a complaint on him becauss i was sure he took it, maybe he suspected me, maybe it was cousin who told him to do so, so at the police station the police calls him and he lies to the police saying i took 5000 aed from him, to which the police told me to settle the matter with him. 

I was lost and made the decision to leave that accommodation, for the next 3 months or so i was homeless in the streets of deira, i was always around baniyas square, al rigga and union side, wandering around asking people for job, i didn't get a job, during the time i gave my luggage to a shopping center as ""baggage deposit"" Becauss i cant bring it with me everywhere and they refused to give it baack after 3 days and demanded 50 AED which i couldnt give, i slept on the streets in just one pair of clothes for about 3 months, i used to shower in the mosques and blew my entire visa savings on transport for interviews and food. 

After 3 months through Facebook after i shared my story someone said theyll help me figure out my visa, my passport and accommodation, and job, i was the happiest and thought that im the luckiest person alive. during the 3 months i tried to apply for a lost passport certificate again and again but it kept getting rejected due to ""techincal errors"" Or my passport detials wasnt found with immigration or something i tried through muraqqabat police station as well as online as well as qusais police. Nothing worked. Anyways that person comes and meets me, he spoke big things as if he was going to take over dubai, fed me with these big things, then told me that he has a canteen in sharjah al dhaid, told me to work there and he will do the visa and passport and he sells visas as well, at first when i got there there was no ac nothing, i worked and slept there jtself under the scorching sun but I wanted my visa and passport to be sorted so i struggled i had to make the sacrifice and its not like i wasnt homeless before. About 3- 4 months i worked there until the canteen was ready and AC was put and all but no sign of any earnings for me and no visa and no passport, i didnt care about the money i just wanted the passport and visa, but nothing? I spent 7 months or so in the same pair of clothes, and i couldn't do anything about it, after that through facebooo i again i was hired for a part time gig as a model for peets coffee in arabian ranches and theyd pay me 500 AED, i told this guy, let me name him N the guy who promised me visa and all, I told him about this and he said he'd drop me, this canteen was in a stadium 63 km from al nahda dubai, so i couldn't go myself of course now he comes and bring me to Dubai, where i had gone for the shoot, after the shoot i was to be paid 500 aed but through bank transfer and i didnt know anyone except this guy N so i requested him that if i receive the 500 through his bank can hw give me cash? He agreed to it, so i forwarded his bank details, for a month no cash was received and i didnt want to disturb him i didnt want him to think im doubting that he spent it or anything so i didnt ask, after a month i ask the sender and she says that she sent 2-3 days ago, i forward that message to him, and he was like ""oh that was yours? I thought it was from one of my client so i spent it, i dont have it now ill pay you when i get"" I was like just look after my passport and visa,its okay. 

Now after a few days the owner of that stadium comes to me and tells me that this guy N has been arrested due to ""fraud"" And im shook, no passport? No visa? And now hws arrested? And the owner kicks me out of there and tells me to take my things and leave as he's hiring someone else. I was so heartbroken but i had nothing to say. 

Next morning i was out and i again was homeless and broke in deira again as deira js the only place i knew, i spent my days just wandering here and there and trying to get a job, i became on absconding even, and was totally lost. 

Fast forward to 3-4 months ago, now I posted about my story again and someone offered me a bedspace, i stayed there for a month and during that time i saw a post where someone needed a model for content creation and i have been creating content in the past so i signed myself up for it and got it, it was a part time gig and they paid a little well, i was able to shift to al nahda sharjah as rent is cheaper here in bedspace and i even started mess food system with someone now i got 1-2 nore shoots after that and then yet again dry, people want to hire me but they want me to record myself and i didnt have an iphone anymore as i had to sell it while i was homeless, I had just a cheap android that camera doesnt work, i posted about this again on reddit seeing if maybe someone would help me out for any iphone so i can start getting gigs again, as many were waiting, someone finallu stepped forward and did they paid my pending rent of December and gave me an iphone 11, i started connecting with businesses again but yet again this wasnt going to sustain me, plus the new media license thing? Everyone asks about that, so i decide to look for jobs in contenr creation. Thats when finally i landed my first interview with a company, they liked me and my confidence and promised a job of content creator cum social media management in AD and that theyll test or train me for 3-4 days then theyll issue me the offer letter in which affer that theyll clear my fines and absconding as well.

This is like answered prayers and with a good company, plus they'll cut from my salary a percentage until they make all of their money back that they invested into me. 

Now the issue is:

1) I don't have money to go from al nahda to AD

2) i need to pay my pending rent. 

3) I need to pay for the mess pending payment as well. 

4) i was able to collect few things and clothes which i now need a suit case if im to take with me, which i dont have as well. 

What do i do? How do i resolve all of this? 

Im just lost and dont know what is to be done as this is my one and only chance of getting my visa status sorted and finally FINALLY having a job. 

P.s i received a call during my homeless time from the police and was told to come to muraqqabat police station to collect my passport so i have my passport but becauss of i was unable to pay for my bedspacr rent and mess i didnt want to lose it i gave my passport as collateral that ill collect it when i pay... And now i really need it and im just so lost... I need advice or like any charity place or somethinh idkkk im just so lost.. ",1,1771408920.0,u_createwitharn,0,1.0,False

1r7z0he,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r7z0he/my_land_wont_stop_bleeding_pt_2/,My Land Won't Stop Bleeding Pt 2.," So because of some support on my last post here, I thought I’d come back pretty quick with another story about my property. Let’s see last time I told you about the eastern part of my property and the fates of those poor old workers, and I forgot to clarify some stuff. 

 First off I’m twenty-three now, so I’ve been here for quite a few years at this point. 

 Second off; the wild-life here is actually fairly normal despite all the strange happenings, though I’ll say they try to stick closer to my house than the woods where they should be. Not that I’m gonna complain, it’s kinda nice to have a few baby deer running around my little yard, it helps make everything just a lil’ more bearable.

 Finally no, there isn’t any burial grounds here, nothing buried here dies so nothing gets buried here.

 Anyways, about that totem, wait, hang on, do you even know what a totem is? Like the literal definition?

 It doesn’t matter all that much, you’ll see soon enough. So let’s take everything back to when I was around twenty, this was about a year after the whole Blood Tower incident (check the last post), and I had somewhat recovered mentally, though the curtains to my bedroom window had been permaneantly nailed shut and I intend for them to stay that way.

 Sorry, sorry, getting off track, the Totem, lemme tell you it’s history first. There’s this small town called Little Hope about ten miles off from my house, in it is this little diner I like to eat at when it mists just a little. So one day I was sitting in this cozy red booth, just looking out the blurry windows as the cars drove by, the smell of fresh coffee and bacon lingered in the air, and the only noise was the main waitress talking to some old man at the counter along with clinking plates from the kitchen.

 That’s why she startled me.

 I’ll try to write a little of our conversation, but I can’t remember all of it.

 The woman slid into the booth across from me, wavy auburn hair, green eyes, she looked a good bit older than me, maybe around late thirties or forties. Really the only distinguishing mark on the Woman I came to know as Amy was the vertile slight scar on the center of her forehead, it was oddly straight, surgical almost. Anyways she was dressed for the weather, a bright red coat with these beautiful set of ruby ear-rings that must have cost a fortune. 

 With a smile that could’ve turned the sky blue again, she spoke, her southern accent a scoche lighter than mine, “Hi there darlin’, you the new owner of the Old Davie Place?” 

 Naturally my isolation made me… a little unaccustomed to speaking, “Uhm… I don’t know?”

 She smiled a little wider, “My mistake, the Davie Place is inbetween those tree farms, it’s where the uh, those workers went missing a year ago.”

 A cold shiver ran down my spine, suddenly wondering if there were rumors floating around Woodsbury, “Oh, oh yeah, I own the property, why?”

 This is where I went wrong, the question shouldn’t have been ‘why?’ It shouldve been, ‘how do you know I own the property?’ But I digress, it was her next words that really put me off, “Did the owner tell you about what was west of the house?”

 “No, we really didn’t talk much after I handed him the cash.”

 With an apologetic look she reached across the table to try and take my hand, and my hand left the hot cup of coffee I had been holding onto. She looked a little hurt and her smile faded, but put both her hands in her lap and said, “Well you’ve been saddled with… something. Davie never really talked about it much, but tch, one time when I went over to ask him about some deer guts I found on my side of the fence, he looked scared as all hell. Kept rambling on about how ‘the demon to the west’.”

 Of course you can understand my concern, “What?!”

 Immediately her smile returned and it was like she saw that someone else had finally felt the same thing she felt, “Exactly! Anyways he told me to tell the next owner to ‘check under the porch’ come fall, and seeing as its fall I’d advise you to get home and do just that. Gotta keep the ‘demon’ in check am I right?”

 She said it like a joke and started to get up, before I stood with her, “Excuse me Ms uhm…”

 “Amy, just call me Amy.”

 “Amy, right. Did he tell you anything else? And you said on your side of the fence, you live next to me?”

 With a wave of her hand, Amy said in that bright tone, “Oh no, that was pretty much all he told me. But as for your second question, yes I do, I’ll come over and visit some time, you should really try my chili.”

 Then she left, and I felt the biggest bolt of dread in my life, not from the invite, no, it was from the ‘thing under the porch’. But still, after getting some sausage and eggs to go, I got back in my truck and started the drive back to my house. 

 When I got up to the gate, I didn’t unlock and undo the chain like usual to get in, I just stared. You could see my house from the gate, even if only barely through the tall grass and trees. The faded blue paint made the pitch black windows seem even more imposing, voids imposed upon reality, and under the wood, under the stairs leading up to my porch.

 There was something under them, and I had been sleeping over it for a year now. 

 Do you know how fucking stupid I am? What kind of idiot actually considers leaning down to look under the porch? What kind of an idiot would cram himself into a dark wet space, no, ignore the supernatural stuff, ignore the flesh tower, who would cram themselves into a place that was hard to escape if something living was under there, even if it was just a snake?

 Sorry, letting my emotions get the best of me, but I did crawl under there. 

 After parking in front of the house I noticed there was a hole in the wooden netting under the porch, to be honest I’m not totally sure if it was there when I left this morning, I didn’t really care either.

 I’m really tired, have I mentioned that? I’m tired now, I was really tired then, it had taken me a while to block out what happened to those workers. One of them was this really nice guy named Liam and… it’s hard to become friends with someone and then they’re just gone the next day, no resolution or ending just… I’m sorry I won’t get off-topic again. 

 I got out of the truck, and bent down, tilting my head to peer into the hole, just wet dirt and worms, hate worms. My phone’s flashlight was both just enough to see a good bit ahead of me, and just bad enough to not be any real comfort. Then without giving it another thought, I crammed myself into the space under the porch, feeling the wood scrape against the sides of my stomach.

 All the sounds of nature faded, replaced by the dull hum of silence, the ground under me was wet and every few seconds of dragging myself forward I would swipe in front of me and get rid of a swath of cobwebs, hoping that nothing would crawl up my arms. 

 Finally I think I found what Amy had told me about, placed perfectly upright in the center of the space under the porch… was a small shoebox. I rolled onto my back to get a little more comfortable, strangely enough I felt safe down there, like I’d found the one place in the world where nothing could find me. I slid the top of the box off, tipping the contents onto the ground.

 There was a folded up piece of index paper, and a map of the property, and after aligning the old map, I saw there was a small unassuming patch of trees circled in red sharpie, and the note read.

 ‘When the land’s cycle starts to end, pay your respects to the land. Give it flesh, or it will take yours.’

 Then in the room above me

 Thump

 Something had fallen in the living room, that’s what I thought, that’s what I prayed, instinctively I froze.

 Thump, thump, thump, thump. 

 Steps going back, towards the kitchen, towards the backdoor.

 Creak.

 My eyes grew wet and stung with tears, I bit my bottom lip, doing everything I could to keep from crying. Something hadn’t fallen, someone had run across my living room and just opened the backdoor. I blinked through the tears, and bent my head back as far as it would go, my neck hurting from how far I craned it. 

 Through the slits in the wood I could see two legs lowering onto the ground, not like they were stepping, but like they had floated down from the air, both of them were this horrible mess of sinew, like someone had heard humans had red muscle under their skin, and someone had just thrown strands of red together to try to imitate it. They stood there for a second, faced away from me, before they rose up and promptly began to float north in a straight line.

 I didn’t breathe again until finally it disappeared into the forest at the edge of the clearing. 

 It was a few more minutes until I dragged myself out of the space, wiping off all the grime from myself. It felt like crawling out of a grave, dirt staining my sweater and jeans, worms writhing on me, cobwebs covering my phone and hands. 

 Then I just sat down, taking deep, shuddering breaths. 

 Flesh, right, I needed to give flesh, that was a goal to focus on, and at the time that’s all I wanted, a goal to focus on. 

 So I went to the front door and opened it, not thinking about what I had heard just minutes before. There was a crimson stain on the ceiling of my living room, and on the ground there were bare, bloody footprints on the ground, a sixth toe wedged in the center of each print like some mutant cousin to humanity had just ran through the place where I ate my dinner.

It wasn’t just that, the air reeked of copper, like being submerged in a swamp made of pennies, I remember muttering, “God it reeks in here.”

 The backdoor was wide open, and when I went to grab the handle to pull it closed, my hand was stuck for a moment before pulling away. It wasn’t like regular blood, it was like sludge, pulling away from the brass doorknob in thick strands that I could meld like puddy.

 But even that wasn’t the strangest thing, it was the feather, I found this stark white feather on the ground that reflected light like a proud lion preening at the attention, making everything else dull around it. Even though it was as clean as a cherished dove, it didn’t feel good to hold it, it felt wrong. 

 So I burnt it in the fireplace, after all, I had to find flesh. 

 Luckily it hadn’t been a super long time since I’d been grocery shopping, so I had a few sealed packages of ground beef, and since the note hadn’t specified if the flesh had to be fresh, I hoped this would do. Then I began the walk to the western front of my property.

 And after shoving my way through thick branches and brush, feeling like a conquistador on the edge of a damned El Dorado, I found It in a clearing only big enough to contain the Totem. 

 Looming over me and all the trees was a man made of straw and twigs, thick and utterly featureless sat cross-legged on the dry earth. From the right hand protruded only two fingers, they were pointing up, and from the left hand also protruded two fingers, though they were pointing down. Laid in front of the Man of Straw and Twig, was the skeletons of several women. The dresses they wore were old, really, really old, and they had these bonnets like those old paintings of the pilgrims. 

 But looking back it was so weird, I mean any kind of pilgrim from England having gone this far west? There wasn’t any record of it, none that I could find anyways. The air felt really still around it, so still and silent that it felt uncomfortable, well maybe silence wasn’t quite the right way to put it, but the closer I got to this effigy, the louder this weird hum got.

 The best way I can put it is this, ever have a boss or a teacher tell you they wanna talk to you alone? They take you to some office, or they take you out in the hallway, and it feels like there was just this deafening aura around the both of you, and the lines of the conversation were so defined that when one stopped the other was invited to speak without any interruption. That’s what it felt like to stand under it, except there wasn’t any conversation, just the well-defined pause inbetween.

 My hands shook as they peeled off the ground beef’s plastic wrap, I know it sounds weird but I kept expecting it to talk or give me orders. But it never did, and in less than a minute I dumped the ground beef right in front of the bodies of the pilgrims. I would’ve expected the earth to swalow up all the raw beef… that or me. 

 But nothing happened, however, that silent presence that hung in the air dissipated. 

 May sound anti-climactic, but that’s kind of the end of that story, every year or so I bring some kind of semi-fresh beef out to the statue, one moment there’s a presence, and the next second there isn’t.

 Anyways uhm, that’s it when it comes to the western part of my Property. I might take a break from posting for a few more days, something up here is goin’ wrong and I need to take some time off to look into some stuff in town. This is Hallmund Mack signing out, thanks for reading.

I started tracking with waterminder and forcing myself to hit 60oz during fasting window even though drinking plain water is boring as hell. headaches pretty much disappeared within 3 days.
Also way easier to complete fasting period now, hunger is there obviously but its manageable instead of feeling weak and foggy. I can tell difference between actual hunger and just being thirsty which helps avoid breaking fast early.
The tracking part matters bc my perception of how much I'm drinking was way off. I thought I was getting enough but data showed I was barely hitting 30oz during 18 hour fast which explains everything.

\* it also can't hold my portafilter or dosing cup, so i've gotta hold it there all the time. (49mm accessories)

  
i also have a feeling that it's bottlenecking my coffee. i go to cafes, try their coffee, love it, buy some, go home and make it, and then it does not taste the same. i've got a la pavoni and know how to use it, so i'm guessing it's the grinder. i'm not sure if it's the burrs themselves or something i can change.

  
when i look at upgrades, i'm torn between something like the eureka atom 75 because single dosing kinda blows, or something like the lagom casa / varia vs6. that being said, i think i wanna try and modify the silenzio before spending more money on something else.

But real energy shifts don’t come from pretending to be happy. They come from movement.

In physics, vibration is movement. When you feel “low,” you feel heavy, static, stuck. So the solution isn’t fake smiles — it’s breaking the stasis.

Raising your vibration isn’t about chasing excitement. It’s about gently shifting your state — physically first, mentally second.

Here’s how to do it instantly and honestly.

 

# 1. The Physical Circuit Breaker

**Your biology is the fastest path to your psychology.**

If your mind feels trapped, move the machine.

·       **The Shake Out:** Stand up and shake your arms, legs, and torso for 60 seconds. It sounds silly, but it releases stored tension and signals to your nervous system that something is changing.

·       **Cold Water Reset:** Splash cold water on your face or take a 30-second cold shower. It shocks your system into the present moment and interrupts spiraling thoughts.

·       **Change Your View:** Step outside or move to another room. A new visual environment gives your brain fresh data, breaking repetitive thought loops.

Movement creates momentum. Momentum shifts energy.

 

# 2. The Power of Awe

Awe expands you. Low states shrink you.

·       **Look Up:** At the sky. The tops of trees. The ceiling. Looking upward subtly shifts posture and psychology toward openness.

·       **Micro-Awe:** Notice one small miracle near you — light reflecting in a glass, the texture of a leaf, the rhythm of your breath. Awe doesn’t require mountains. It requires attention.

Awe softens the ego and reconnects you to something larger than your mood.

 

# 3. Sound Is Vibration

Energy responds to frequency.

·       **High-Energy Music:** Play a song that makes your body move before your mind resists.

·       **Binaural Beats (432 Hz / 528 Hz):** Many people use these frequencies to support calmness and clarity. Even if you’re skeptical, the act of intentional listening shifts focus.

Let sound carry you when willpower feels weak.

 

# 4. The Immediate Gratitude Audit

When you’re low, don’t reach for big gratitude. Go small.

·       “I’m grateful for this warm coffee.”

·       “I’m grateful for this chair.”

·       “I’m grateful for this breath.”

Micro-gratitude pulls you out of scarcity and into enoughness. And “enough” is a powerful frequency.

 

# 5. Conscious Breathing (Vagus Nerve Reset)

Breath is the bridge between body and mind.

Try the **4-7-8 technique**:

·       Inhale for 4 seconds

·       Hold for 7 seconds

·       Exhale slowly for 8 seconds

The long exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system — your body’s calm switch. It tells you: *You are safe. You can let go.*

 **Spiritual Honesty: Don’t Force “High Vibes”**

Sometimes a low vibration isn’t negativity — it’s exhaustion. It’s your body asking for rest.

If jumping to “high vibe” feels fake, don’t do it. Aim for **neutral** first. Peace is a better bridge than forced excitement.

Energy shifts don’t require performance.  
They require awareness.  
And small, honest movement.

Because raising your vibration isn’t about becoming someone else.

It’s about gently coming back to yourself",1,1771407014.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

I’m currently in Chandigarh for a little solo reset trip (yes, I’m real, no this is not a scam).

 I’m a 26F visiting from the US and although this isn't my first time in India, it is my first time here in this city. 

I’m not looking for anything wild, just genuinely want to see what the city has to offer, maybe meet some cool, normal humans and experience Chandigarh beyond Google recommendations.

I like:

Good food 
Peaceful spots / Nature
Interesting conversations
Random underrated gems locals love

Looking for some recommendations for co-working spaces. I'm a bit tired of the the library and coffee shops.

I'd probably only need to go in three days a week (although the option to go in more often would be good). Some kind of flexible desk/hot desk option would be fine for me. 

It would be nice if the place has a decent social side. I know some advertise themselves as hosting social events etc. but even if it's just a place where you know people are willing to have a chat now and then or there's a cafe or whatever on site, that would be good. 

So far Avenue HQ at Mann Island looks promising. Someone on here recommended DoES a while back. I've also had a quick look at Ember Cowork's website. Basecamp in the Baltic Triangle also looks good.

I've never used a co-working space before so any insights into the options available would be much appreciated.

About 2 months ago I got really burned out and decided to try something small, no phone until 11am. No scrolling, no replies, just coffee, reading, maybe walking. I didnt even tell anyone because I assumed nobody would notice. Turns out people notice EVERYTHING.



Now my group chat keeps joking that Im ""mysterious"" or that I must be mad at someone. One friend straight up asked if I joined a cult lol. Another said I feel less warm lately because Im slower to respond. The weird thing is I actually feel calmer and more present when I do talk, but they interpret silence as distance. Yesterday someone said ""you used to be fun before your self improvement era"" and it honestly stung more than I expected.



I dont want to go back to constant availability because it was draining me hard, but I also dont want to lose friendships over a boundary that seems harmless to me.

* Full cleaning cycle and a hard reset.
* Took the brew group out and deep cleaned it (screen is clear).
* Ran a full descaling cycle using a bottle of vinegar (I’ve since read this might be bad for the seals... oops).

Nothing has improved the flow. Is this a sign the pump is actually dying, or could it be an airlock or a swollen O-ring from the vinegar?

1r7yf2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1r7yf2z/i_am_a_very_forgiving_person_but_i_can_never/,I am a very forgiving person but I can never forgive a Narcissist as I heal and this is why.,"So it's been over 2 months since my nex discarded me. I went through a very very rough time with confusion, shock and hurt. Whilst they spent their time grooming someone else.

Anyway, this girl has been on my socials since break up and I was very focused on therapy, friends and learning self-love and not intending to fill any gap with someone else and just really learning to sit with myself and processing my grief and hurt on here. One day I posted a video on TikTok too early and she commented on it almost immediately so I dm'ed her to be like what the hell. We ended up talking everyday and have not stopped since, I was not intending having anything other than casual in my life for 2026 while I heal and do therapy and focus on me but this woman was very different, and in ways which I carry myself with anyone.

Anyway, I've been getting to know her very slowly and she has been giving me space to continue so. She has been of the secure attachment type, I've even tested the waters of introducing her to my online world and heavy flirting with my friends and she gets along with them so well. No going behind my back being possessive and shutting them down like my nex did. No head fucking.

We are lesbians for anyone wondering. She has been showing me loyalty and commitment without us being exclusive and the other day I noticed her ex partner (the father of her kids), has been calling everytime we are together. My nex has done a number on me, I have had trust issues prior and they just threw the bucket over finding out how many people they dragged on for the first year (basically cheated the entire first year). Going behind my back, then gaslighting me making me feel crazy for their boundary crossings. I almost wanted to brush it off but thought to myself, I have to do something different this time. So I messaged her and asked about the dynamic with her ex. But what happened after shocked me about how narcissistic abuse has impacted me. Because of a simple question, after I had sent it. I was sitting on the toilet at work, full trauma response; knees to my chest holding myself about to have a panic attack because of anticipating a response my next would had which would've been the typical DARVO response. 

Her response, instead was nothing I have EVER experienced before ever. I started learning what secure attachment even meant. She explained what the dynamic was, she told me how often he visits; this girl is not even my girlfriend yet but she offered to show me her messages. I said to her I said I never want that dynamic with us, I said but her just offering that and being so open just healed a part of me that I had no idea could be healed. I recall jumping up and down thinking I was crazy that my nex never offered those things and made me feel crazy and a burden for having insecurities. She'd use my insecurities against me and pretend I was controlling her because I was vulnerable enough to show them. Not only that, the new girl she told me that I am just human and I have insecurities as everyone does; she said she will always reassure me in not just words but actions with time she said that she will never see my questions as accusations, which was always an issue in the past. I cried so hard that day, I had never been held like that before. I then realised if this fails that this is all on me because I haven't healed so I said look I have clocked I have some work and healing to do still, I have done A LOT over the past 2 months but some parts of me scan for narcissistic abuse still to a point a simple question triggered me so bad I almost had a panic attack. She is funny she said babe I know you've been broken up for a whole 4 minutes, I want to watch you blossom, we will take it as slow as you need. I think I died a little inside, and not only that she really shows that in action, I can go out, I can not text her on time, I can be fully myself and trust that she is loyal and she does the same. Nothing is intense, even the affection, nothing is ""I will never hurt you"", its actions. 

And what is crazy, is that I am more in touch with who I was 10 years ago; sweet, kind, not guarded, with boundaries and warm than I have ever been. Because she adds to my cup not drain it. I just give to people around me, I recall how I used to be right before I met the nex. Everything is different, the more time I spend with her the more recharged I am to give to everyone around me; before the more time I spent with the nex the more I ran away from people. Weirdly enough, I am not even afraid of losing her, I don't need her, I am content in my life on my own now; but I am definately grateful that she is in it and that gratitude feels so different to that need. 

She is completely the opposite of my nex:  
\- She is a real giver; not in ways that makes her feel wanted in ways that genuinely a giver and we are so similar in that; that it doesn't feel transactional. We give each other's love language.  
\- She is nurturing and caring; she has been bringing me food and coffee now that my job is closer to home almost every single day.  
\- She is a single mum and doesn't work but I haven't seen a single person parent like she does; she takes that role like it's her lifeline. It is the single attractive thing that draws me to her; even though we've been speaking for a month; I am yet to see her kids or won't be anytime soon. I love that about her. She takes them to school, classes, cooks, helps them with everything; and they always come first and so does their emotional and mental wellbeing and that has been so fucking important to me. I thought I always needed a career driven person with ambitions; but guess I just needed someone who invested themselves in whatever they did.   
\- She is very patient, emotionally attuned and we can sit in silence for ages and just be present.  
\- She is attentive and listens so fully; doesn't hijack the conversation with her own stories saying I'm just trying to relate.   
\- She does so much for people around her, her sister, friends, family on weekly basis. It warms my fkn heart.  
\- She is witty, funny and has such a cute sense of humour.   
\- She is content; simple and just appreciative of existence.  
\- That is all aside the fact that she is absolutely stunning and I am punching so hard and we have a sexual chemistry better than I have ever experienced. In fact I thought I was somewhat broken, turns out I just didn't feel safe enough, I felt criticised and punished and I didn't even know. 

We have this beautiful ebb and flow with us; where we give each other the same things. It's like we naturally speak each other's language and when we can't we talk about it; and it is so easy to just talk about it.

I guess I have learnt now; that my sense of self and worth was so beaten down and waited for so long that it almost vanished to nothing and I stayed with the Narc thinking I'd not deserve any better. The biggest thing I have ever ever given myself is time to truly heal alone, it's like this has been the universe's gift to me. It's like here is many lessons, and you didn't learn? here is a Narc that if you don't do the work you gonna get knocked so hard you gonna wake up. And when I did the work post that horrendous discard; the universe was like here is what you truly deserve. Now you can be safe because you gave yourself that safety first. And I guess I'll continue to work on myself, to continue healing. 

Nothing seems scary, or hard in life anymore. Everything just feels secure even when it becomes undone. I can't wait for her to meet my family, to be part of my life properly and give her everything good that I tried to give the ones that just took from me.

And I will never ever, look for, reach for, talk to or want to know of the Narc that existed in my life. I am grateful that dark cloud got removed from my life. A part of my heart will always ache and long for the little girl we co-parented, but time heals everything and as long as she grows up happy, healthy and strong, I will live happy knowing that and will always be available for her; even my new girl knows that and appreciates that. 

Life after Narcissistic abuse is hard, very hard; the work when you're absolutely shattered is harder; the set backs in self-gaslighting and trauma responses feel like torture but nothing can undo the work you can do for yourself x",1,1771406713.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,1.0,False

""Daniel? Honey?"", warm and close.

""Olivia. I want to hear you for a second."" His voice, soft and intimate. ""You know that. I care about you. I just need to be careful.""

My breath catches. He didn't hang up. He didn't realize he dialed me. He doesn't know I'm listening.

""I just need to know where I stand."" she says again. 

""You are more important than my wife,"" he speaks to her gently. ""I promise.""

The words land like a physical blow, I can't help letting out a broken breath. 

The voice on the other end goes still.

""What was that?"" Olivia asks.

Daniel doesn't answer. I imagine him pulling the phone away from his ear now, checking the screen, his brow furrowing.

Then—too late—realization dawns.

""Wait,"" he says quickly. ""Hold on.""

I reach forward and end the call.

Not the peaceful kind of quiet, either. This is the kind that hums in your ears, that makes every small sound feel louder than it should. The refrigerator kicks on with a low groan. The clock above the stove ticks, slow and deliberate, like it’s counting down to something I don’t know I’m waiting for yet.

The kitchen light flickers when I switch it on. I make a mental note to replace the bulb tomorrow, even though tomorrow already feels like a foreign concept.

Half the room is packed. Boxes stacked against the wall. A roll of tape sits on the counter beside a marker with my handwriting smeared across the cardboard: WINTER CLOTHES. BOOKS. KIDS’ ART.

I hate that one the most.

I slide my phone across the counter, meaning to check the time. It lights up in my hand, and that’s when I see the missed call notification.

Daniel.

Five minutes ago.

I frown, my thumb hovering. He said he’d be late tonight. Some last-minute thing at work. I hadn’t questioned it. I rarely do anymore. Eight years of trust will do that to you. It makes you soft in places you don’t realize are exposed.

I tap his name and bring the phone to my ear.

“Hey,” I say quietly. “You called?”

There’s a pause. Just long enough to feel strange.

Then his voice comes through the speaker.

Soft.

Lower than usual.

Not the clipped, distracted tone he uses with clients. Not the tired warmth he uses with me at the end of long days.

This voice is… gentle.

Intimate.

“I know,” he says. “I just, I needed to hear you for a second.”

My breath catches.

I pull the phone away from my ear and look at the screen, my stomach tightening as if my body already knows something my mind hasn’t caught up to yet.

The call timer is running.

He didn’t hang up.

He didn’t realize he dialed me.

The room feels suddenly too small, like the walls are inching closer.

“Daniel?” a woman’s voice says.

It’s close to him. Too close.

Warm. Familiar in a way that doesn’t belong to me.

Something cold slides down my spine.

“I’m here,” he says, and there’s a smile in his voice. I can hear it. “Sorry. I thought I heard something.”

I don’t move.

I don’t breathe.

The phone trembles slightly in my hand, and I switch it to speaker without thinking, setting it faceup on the counter like it might burn me if I keep holding it.

“I just don’t want to rush this,” he continues. “You know that. I care about you. I just need to be careful.”

Careful.

The word echoes in my head, hollow and sharp all at once.

The woman laughs softly. Not a giggle. Not playful. It’s low and knowing, like she already understands him better than she should.

“I get it,” she says. “I do. I just… sometimes I feel like I’m living in the pauses. Like I only exist in between the rest of your life.”

My knees weaken, and I grip the edge of the counter to steady myself.

In between.

That’s what she thinks she is.

Daniel exhales slowly. “You’re not nothing. You know that.”

A pause. I can picture it too clearly. The way he probably looks when he says things like this. The way his shoulders relax. The way his voice drops, like he’s letting someone see the parts he keeps guarded.

“You matter to me,” he says.

The words land like a physical blow.

I swallow hard, my throat tight, my heart slamming against my ribs so violently I’m afraid the sound will somehow travel through the phone.

“Daniel,” she says again, and this time there’s a softness there that makes my chest ache. “I just need to know where I stand.”

Silence stretches.

My pulse roars in my ears.

Then he says it.

“Olivia.”

The name slips out of him like it belongs there.

Like he’s said it a hundred times already.

Olivia.

It doesn’t hit all at once. It seeps in slowly, like ink bleeding through paper. My brain tries to reject it, tries to find a version of this moment where it makes sense, where it’s harmless, where I’m misunderstanding something obvious.

But there’s nothing harmless in the way he says her name.

Nothing platonic in the way his voice softens around it.

“I’m trying,” he continues. “I promise. This isn’t simple.”

I let out a sound before I can stop myself. A quiet, broken breath that scrapes out of my chest.

The voice on the other end goes still.

“What was that?” Olivia asks.

My heart stutters.

Daniel doesn’t answer right away. I imagine him pulling the phone away from his ear now, checking the screen, his brow furrowing.

Then—too late—realization dawns.

“Wait,” he says slowly. “Hold on.”

I reach forward and end the call.

The screen goes black, reflecting my face back at me. Pale. Eyes too bright. Mouth slightly open like I’ve forgotten how to close it.

For a second, I just stand there.

The kitchen smells faintly of cardboard and dish soap. The clock keeps ticking. Somewhere down the hall, the floor creaks as the house settles.

The world hasn’t ended.

It just feels like it has.

My phone buzzes almost immediately.

Daniel calling.

Again.

I don’t answer.

It buzzes again.

And again.

I slide it face down on the counter and back away from it like it’s dangerous.

I should be screaming. Crying. Throwing something. That’s what you do in moments like this, right? That’s how it looks in movies and books.

Instead, I feel strangely… still.

Empty in a way that’s almost peaceful.

Like something heavy has finally been set down.

Eight years.

That number rolls through my mind, uninvited. Eight years of mornings and routines and shared groceries and inside jokes. Eight years of building something I thought was solid. Permanent.

Forever.

I lower myself into one of the kitchen chairs, my legs finally giving out. The wood is cold against my palms.

Forever.

I think of our child asleep down the hall. The way small arms wrap around my neck at bedtime. The way trust is so easy at that age. So absolute.

A sharp ache blooms in my chest, but I don’t let it spill over. Not yet.

The phone lights up again, this time with a text.

Please. Call me.

I stare at the words until they blur.

No.

Not yet.

I need to understand what just happened before I let him explain it away. Before he tries to soften it. Before he tells me it isn’t what it sounded like.

Because it sounded like everything.

I stand slowly and walk to the sink, turning on the faucet. The rush of water fills the room, loud and grounding. I brace my hands against the edge and look out the dark window above it.

My reflection stares back at me, unfamiliar and older somehow.

This is the moment, I realize.

Not the fight that will come later. Not the tears. Not the packing or the explanations or the apologies.

This.

The moment where I heard the truth before it was meant for me.

The moment where I understand, with a strange and painful clarity, that something fundamental has shifted. That the man I trusted with my whole heart is standing somewhere else, speaking softly into the night, saying another woman’s name like it belongs to him.

Daniel will come home later.

He’ll walk through the door with his careful face on. He’ll try to control the narrative.

But it’s already too late.

Because I heard him.

And he doesn’t know yet—but I do—that nothing between us will ever sound the same again.

......

Morning comes like nothing happened.

That’s the first thing that feels wrong.

Sunlight slips through the blinds in thin, pale lines, landing across the kitchen counter like it’s any other weekday. The coffee maker hums to life when I press the button, its familiar gurgle filling the silence. Somewhere down the hall, the floor creaks. Pipes knock softly in the walls.

Normal sounds. Normal light.

My hands shake as I reach for a mug.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. I lay there all night listening to the rise and fall of Daniel’s breathing beside me, my body stiff, my mind wide awake. Every time he shifted, every time his arm brushed mine, my skin crawled like it didn’t recognize him anymore.

He came home late. Quiet. Slipped into bed like he always does. He didn’t know I was awake.

He still doesn’t know I heard him.

The coffee finishes brewing, and I pour it out of habit, even though my stomach twists at the smell. I take a sip anyway. It’s too hot. I don’t flinch. The burn feels deserved somehow.

Behind me, footsteps approach.

“Morning,” Daniel says.

His voice is normal.

That’s the second thing that feels wrong.

I turn slowly. He’s standing in the doorway, hair still damp from the shower, sleeves rolled up as he reaches for a clean mug. He looks like the man I’ve known for eight years. Comfortable. Familiar. Solid.

The man I trusted.

“Morning,” I reply, surprised at how steady my voice sounds.

He pours himself coffee, adds cream, stirs it absentmindedly. He doesn’t look at me right away. He never does before caffeine.

“How’d you sleep?” he asks.

The question lands heavy between us.

“Fine,” I say.

It’s a lie, but it’s an easy one. It slides out smoothly, practiced. I’ve had all night to rehearse it.

He nods, satisfied, and leans against the counter, scrolling through his phone. The screen lights his face in that familiar blue glow. I watch his expression carefully, waiting for something to crack. Guilt. Tension. Anything.

Nothing.

He looks exactly the same.

“So,” he says after a moment, “I’ve got an early meeting. Might be a long day.”

Of course you do.

“Okay.”

My coffee sits untouched now, cooling in my hands. The heat seeps through the ceramic, grounding me. I focus on that instead of the memories clawing at the back of my mind. His voice. Her name. The way he said it like it mattered.

Daniel finishes his drink and rinses the mug, setting it neatly in the drying rack. He moves around me like nothing’s changed, like we’re still the same people we were yesterday morning.

I realize, with a strange clarity, that this is the moment.

Not the phone call. Not the shock.

This.

Watching him exist so easily inside a lie.

....

Down the hall, a door creaks open.

“Mom?”

Her voice is small, still sleepy.

I turn as she pads into the kitchen in her socks, hair sticking up in soft, uneven tufts. She rubs one eye with the back of her hand and yawns wide enough to make me smile despite myself.

“Morning, baby,” I say.

She goes straight to Daniel, wrapping her arms around his waist without hesitation. He bends automatically, pressing a pecking to the top of her head.

“Morning, sunshine.”

I watch them, my chest tight.

She pulls back and looks between us, brow furrowing slightly. “Why are you both so quiet?”

Daniel chuckles. “Too early for conversation.”

She considers this, then looks at me. “You look tired.”

Kids see everything.

“I stayed up too late reading,” I say, reaching for her hand. “Go get dressed. I’ll make you breakfast.”

She nods but doesn’t move right away. Her gaze flicks back to Daniel, then to me again, like she’s trying to piece something together.

“You mad?” she asks softly.

The question slices straight through me.

“No,” I say quickly, crouching in front of her. “Not mad. Just… thinking.”

She seems to accept that, though she leans into me for a second longer than usual before heading back down the hall.

Daniel watches us with a faint smile. “She’s getting perceptive.”

I swallow. “She gets that from you.”

Another lie. Another easy one.

He checks his watch. “I should get going.”

“Okay.”

He grabs his keys, his jacket. Pauses by the door like he’s about to say something else.

For one brief, terrifying moment, I think he knows. I think he’s going to confess. Apologize. Explain.

Instead, he smiles and says, “We’ll talk tonight, yeah?”

Something cold settles in my chest.

“Yeah,” I say.

The door closes behind him with a soft click.

I stand there long after his footsteps fade, staring at the empty space he left behind. The house exhales, quiet rushing back in.

I don’t cry.

That surprises me.

I clean the kitchen instead. Wipe the counters. Rinse my mug. The coffee has gone completely cold now, a thin skin forming across the top. I dump it down the sink and watch it disappear, dark and bitter, down the drain.

This is how it happens, I think.

Not with yelling or slammed doors.

With silence.

With choices made quietly.

I get my daughter ready for school, braid her hair, pack her lunch. She chatters about a spelling test and a class project, blissfully unaware of the fracture running straight through the center of my chest.

At the door, she hugs me tight. “Love you.”

“I love you too.”

When she leaves, the house feels cavernous.

I move through the bedroom slowly, opening drawers, touching familiar things like they might shock me back into certainty. Daniel’s clothes are folded neatly on his side of the dresser. His watch sits where he always leaves it. Everything looks the same.

But I’m not.

I sit on the edge of the bed and finally let myself think the thought I’ve been avoiding since last night.

I can’t stay.

Not like this.

Not pretending I don’t know what I know. Not teaching my child that love means swallowing betrayal because it’s easier than change.

I don’t need answers right now. I don’t need explanations or apologies or promises.

I need space.

I stand and grab a suitcase from the closet. The small one. The one we usually take for weekend trips.

I don’t open the drawers all at once. I choose carefully. A few outfits. Underwear. Toiletries. The essentials. I’m not running.

I’m stepping away.

I pause at the dresser, fingers brushing over a framed photo. Us, smiling, arms around each other, sunburned and happy on some long-ago vacation. I turn it face down without thinking.

One bag.

That’s all.

I zip it closed and carry it to the door, my heart pounding louder with every step.

I don’t know what tonight will bring. I don’t know what Daniel will say when he realizes I’m not here.

But I know this much with absolute certainty:

I heard the truth.

And this is me choosing not to ignore it.

I set the bag down by the door and take a deep breath.

Im (f,28) dating a friend's friend (m,28). I call myself a strong independent woman and a feminist, but due to my ethnic background I am also used to men being the providers at all time. I also come from a country where it's super normal to split the bill on a date (which I always did with no problem) - but I live somewhere else now. Just for some context.

Yesterday me and this said guy spent the most amazing day together. He invited me over to his place, cooked lunch, we had sex and spent the rest of our working day outside in parks and cafés. It was a really beautiful day.

Now the problem: Towards the evening we both got hungry and he suggested to get dinner. Everything was perfect, dinner was great but I offered to pay for it (bc he got me a coffee before and it made me feel awkward) and he just let me pay for it without hesitation instead of insisting. And tbh it made me feel weird. I suddenly felt like his mother and the magic of the entire day just disappeared in this moment. I went 50/50 on dates in the past, but it was mostly with guys I didn't care about seeing again. But now paying the entire bill for a guy that I actually like felt off.

On the way back I kept quiet and he knew that something was off, but he thought it was bc of a little discussion that we had at the restaurant. 

Obviously I don't want him to think he's my bank and I did contribute in the past by paying little things but paying the dinner was really emasculating and didn't feel right. I think as a woman naturally you want to feel provided for and taken care of. 

We are still in the beginning of our relationship and not even exclusive yet but how can I tell him that me paying for our dinner last night didn't sit right with me without making me sound that Im after his money (bc Im really not, as I have a good job my own money) ",0,1771406370.0,dating_advice,26,0.31,False
1r7ybm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianEntrepreneur/comments/1r7ybm7/okay_so_quick_update_because_i_posted_a_few_weeks/,Okay so quick update because I posted a few weeks ago about testing new fragrances for my candle batches…,"[Trying fragrances from Candle Making Supplies India](https://preview.redd.it/gu8g3tkh08kg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f195d84bce5cdc67686077cf8468ef529600799)

I finally tried a few candle-grade oils from [Candle Making Supplies India](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/) after seeing so many makers mention them, and I have thoughts.

First of all — the cold throw surprised me.

Like I opened the curing shelf after 7 days and the room already smelled different. Not “sharp synthetic,” but actually true-to-name fragrance. One of the florals literally made my studio smell like I had fresh flowers in there.

But the real test for me is always hot throw.

I don’t care how cute a candle looks if it disappears after lighting.

So I burned them properly. 2–3 hour sessions. Full melt pool check. No tunneling.

And honestly? The hot throw held up.

Not overpowering. Not headache-inducing. But strong enough that when I walked back into the room after stepping out, I could clearly smell it.

That’s when I got excited. I put out a small batch — nothing crazy, just testing the waters — and a few sold. The feedback that made me lowkey scream was:

“Your candle actually smells even when it’s lit.”

Which sounds basic… but fellow makers know that’s the whole game.

Cold throw gets attention. Hot throw gets repeat customers.And this batch felt more stable. More consistent. Less “I hope this performs.”

I’m not saying fragrance alone makes a brand — but upgrading inputs really changed my confidence while selling. Now I’m lowkey in my fan girl phase because the difference was noticeable.

Still testing. Still tweaking wick pairings. But this batch felt like a small level-up moment.  
  
The fragrances I have tried so far are [Mahogany Shea](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/mahogany-shea), [Sandalwood](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/sandalwood-fragrance-candle-fragrances), [Woody Oud](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/woody-oud-fragrance-oil-candle-fragrances), [Lavender](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/lavender-fragrance-oil-candle-fragrances), [Roasted Coffee](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/roasted-coffee-fragrance-candle-fragrances), [Butterfly BBW Inspired](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/butterfly-bbw-inspired), [Burberry HerPure](https://candlemakingsuppliesindia.store/products/burberry-her)

I genuinely think fragrance quality is the hidden game in this industry.

If you’ve been feeling like your candles look great but don’t perform, maybe test a small batch with a higher-quality oil and see what happens. The difference surprised me.

1r7ya3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1r7ya3y/my_messy_journey_to_channeling_chaotic_curator/,"My messy journey to channeling chaotic curator energy: finally perfected this layered, textural eye look with affordable indie brands 🖤 (Took inspiration from a crumbling antique book!)","Okay, let's talk about that tricky space where you want to look put-together, but not *too* put-together. You know, when the vibe is more ""just emerged from a slightly enchanted forest"" than ""just left the salon."" I recently challenged myself to create a look that felt authentically *literary gothic* without requiring a full hour or a professional MUA skill set. The goal was something that hinted at a shadowy aesthetic, a bit ethereal and slightly undone, but still wearable for a day of errands and coffee shop writing.

My biggest hurdle? Avoiding the ""Halloween costume"" trap when using darker lip colors and intense liner. I wanted depth, not drama for drama's sake.

Here’s a peek into the experiment:

*   **The Vibe:** My inspiration was a blend of *literary gothic* meets a touch of *reverie escapist*. Think windswept moorlands, old libraries, and perhaps a subtle hint of melancholy. I was aiming for muted, deep tones that didn't feel heavy.
*   **The Canvas (Skin):**
    *   **Product:** *Pacifica Alight Multi-Mineral BB Cream* (approx. $16). This is super lightweight and sheer, just enough to even things out without looking like actual makeup.
    *   **Technique:** Applied with fingers, blended out quickly. My aim was a ""skin that just looks really good on its own"" rather than a perfected base.
*   **The Eyes (Subtle Shadow, Defined Lashes):**
    *   **Product 1 (Base):** *ColourPop Super Shock Shadow in ""Liberty""* (approx. $8). This is a silvery-black with a subtle sparkle.
    *   **Technique 1:** A tiny dab on the lid with my finger, then blended out immediately with a fluffy brush to create just a hint of cool-toned shadow, almost like a natural shadow. The goal was definition, not intensity.
    *   **Product 2 (Liner):** *NYX Epic Ink Liner in Black* (approx. $10).
    *   **Technique 2:** A very thin, almost invisible line along the upper lash line, then smudged *immediately* with a pencil brush while still wet. This gave a soft, diffused look, not a crisp line.
    *   **Product 3 (Mascara):** *CoverGirl Lash Blast Volume Mascara in Black* (approx. $9).
    *   **Technique 3:** Just one coat, focused on the roots of the lashes for definition without much length or clump.
*   **The Lips (Muted Depth):**
    *   **Product:** *NYX Suede Matte Lip Liner in ""Soft-Spoken""* (approx. $8). (Yes, just the liner!)
    *   **Technique:** Lined the lips, then filled them in completely with the liner. This gave a deep, dusty rose-mauve color that was matte but not drying, and crucially, didn't look too ""done."" It almost felt like my lips, but better and a little more mysterious.
*   **Time Invested:** Maybe 10-12 minutes from start to finish. Super quick.

**Real Talk: What I Learned & What Didn't Quite Go to Plan**

My initial thought was to use a true deep berry lipstick. However, after applying the sheer eye wash and seeing the muted skin, a full-on dark lipstick felt… jarring. It instantly tipped into ""trying too hard"" territory. The *NYX liner* as a full lip color was a total happy accident! It gave the depth I wanted without the commitment of a darker lipstick, and it truly enhanced the ""just a touch of something different"" vibe.

Another surprise was how much impact a *single smudged liner* could have. I usually go for a crisp wing, but leaning into the imperfect smudge made the eyes feel softer and more lived-in, perfectly fitting the literary gothic mood. It truly felt like I wasn't just wearing makeup, but rather enhancing a character.

This experiment really drove home that ""perfection"" isn't the point. It's about finding what feels right for the mood you're in, the aesthetic you're exploring, and the amount of effort you're willing to put in on any given day. Sometimes the best discoveries come from letting go of the rulebook and just seeing what happens.

Feeling conflicted,"I went on a first date with a guy from a dating app.  He’d answered my opening prompt and asked right away if I’d like to get coffee with him that same day.  For context, we are both in our late 20s and live in an ethnically diverse city, and I’ve never seriously dated before.  Trying the app has been, for me, a means of practicing leaving my comfort zone once in a blue moon.

My date’s profile included no text blurbs, and it did show he knew another language besides English.  His texts to me in solid English led me to assume he spoke both proficiently.

An hour before we met up, he sent a text apologizing about English sometimes being a struggle for him.  I told him Oh, no biggie, thank you for telling me.  When we then met, there was a major language barrier.  I also learned that he moved here just a year ago.  The date went great, despite this jarring information; he apologized for the barrier, was respectful and sweet and very normal, and he laughed as he read my longer, translated messages on his phone.  It was unexpected, but it was fun.

He made it clear he wants to see me again, but I don’t yet understand what he’s hoping for or expecting with me.  It’s a conversation I want to have with him ASAP, and I’m worried about barraging him with my condescending paranoia.

I feel paranoid that a language-gap relationship like this would be somehow unethical of me.  I’m paranoid that even helping him practice his English during casual outings would somehow be, like…akin to grooming, if this were to go anywhere further than platonic in the future.  Maybe this all sounds ridiculous, but I have (diagnosed) OCD so for me it is an intense worry I could seriously ruminate about for weeks.

I’m thinking long term. I want things that go without saying. I want security, comfortability, want a job that i gives me something to work to over a long period of time and in the future i want to be able to provide. 

Now my work history is i done a mechanics apprenticeship a few years back and left, honestly was a dumb decision couldn’t tell you why i left. Maybe it was due to being offered more money elsewhere  i don’t think i ever truly couldn’t bare the work, and my current job of being a head barista in a coffee shop (it was my first job out of secondary school or high school for the Americans)

 now I’m a sixth form drop out as i hated it. I’ve been considering my paths forward and what i can do that align with things i want in the future. I don’t particularly see a future in hospitality/retail sticking with the coffee shop as I’m not happy there now as it is. And i feel like the only right choice with what i have is going back into trades and I’ve had the potential opportunity to go back into mechanics. This aligns w what i want in the future as it gives me stability as i know I’ll always be able to fall back on it, keeps me busy, good pay and an overall good future. 

However, my partner (F20) strongly apposes that. As reason one it is a pay cut, only for a year in the case of my age as it will then go up to minimum wage for a 21 year old which is more than i earn now. 

Reason two is that she said i quit before so why would i go back. And apparently ive told her that it was horrific the people where and they treated me like shit. Which i may have but i dont feel like i did? And if i did truth be told it may at the time have been cope for leaving an apprenticeship i rlly had no reason to leave i was young, dumb and broke and was offered more money elsewhere so took the immediate pay rise. It was about three years ago now i left there so yk i cant rlly remember and i doubt why i rlly left. 

Reason three, she says i should stop thinking about things so far in the future and im assuming that she means like what i want in the future. She says that just get a “regular” job in retail stocking shelves or whatever for a year whilst i figure it out. But i dont like retail/hospitality. 

Reason four, she says it’s too late for me to do an apprenticeship at 20 that it’s “long” hours (8 hours x 5days a week) and that it’s hard work. 

I’ve spoken to my mum about it too and that she doesn’t rlly think it’s right for me and believes it’s more the prospects of the careers that i want rather than the career itself.  

What I’m trying to get at is i don’t know what to do really at a crossroads at the moment. I feel like it’s the right choice for what i want in life or does it feel that way because it’s the only thing infront of me.

i deactivated my accounts, i planned on committing, okay, not because of the rs, but because of depression i've been feeling before i met him and i can't deny that our rs did take a toll on me. i am so tired of life.

 i said goodbye to my friends and my friends told him what was happening. on the day of the valentine's, he walked for 20 minutes from the mall to my house under the sun just to give me a flower (he HATES the heat) he then, left. and then he chatted me how i didn't even say hi or said thank you regarding that he walked in the heat just to give me the flowers. he assumed that i didn't even wanna meet. i then explained that i couldn't show emotions well because my actions in my house or home are usually criticized and i'm scared of that (i'm a victim of domestic abuse btw); and i told him, ""i said thank you—u just didn't hear."" i also did care that he walked under the sun that's why i gave him money for his fare when he's gonna go home so that he doesn't have to walk no more. i apologized too. but he didn't respond to those messages and left me on delivered for hours again. then i sent another paragraph after hours, saying goodbye to him—because i was about to commit su!c!de. (again, he is not the reason) then he tried to let me stay, but then i told him about how hurt i was with the previous stuff and he got mad. and i felt hurt because, i was committing yk?? he was still upset about me not showing appreciation (which i did) (also guys, a week before this, was my first attempt and he immediately contacted my brother to stop me, he was asking for help etc panicking) anyway, .. i failed. i woke up the next day. i sent him paragraphs about how i felt. js to be on delivered again. and i went outside, and met w my friend because i was feeling so depressive. i saw him on the mall w his friend. and i felt so hurt. he said that he had plans that day, which is why he couldnt go on a date with me. but they were literally js doing nothing. i immediately ran to the donut shop to buy because he said he loves donuts. i told my friend to tell him that im there and he should wait for me but he didnt care and left. i started crying and crying in public lol. and suddenly he went to me giving me a drink and i gave him the donuts. we walked together to the park and i started crying. i went away sobbing and he didnt even follow. i then came back to him and told him im going home while crying and he handed me a drink which i then slapped away which made his pants wet, he told me to sit and i continued crying, he started talking saying ""am i that bad to you? i did/do everything for you"" ""i was mad at you for valentine's""  
i told him that i did respond to his statement saying i ""didn't care""  about him walking to my house but he disregarded it, he told me i dont understand him. i brought up the lack of updates, he said stuff like ""i have to sell a lot of stuff in entrepreneurship, i can't be on my phone all the time, i don't have even a second to chat because of how busy i am, and sometimes my phone is low battery because my charger isn't working"" and then i said that ""i tried to kms last night and you ate samgyup w ur friends and u drank soju? really?"" i was sobbing lmao, he responded ""we've been planning this for weeks to celebrate our entrepreneurship performance task"" but i still hated that. and i told him that i send lots of fotos and he doesn't flex me like he does before.  i told him while crying that ""im sure your friend's girlfriend didn't have to ask him to flex her."" and he got pissed off and told me to go home. we went outside the park, i told him while crying that i dont understand how he could ignore me and be mad when i js tried to kms last night. and he said ""ive been showing you taht i care since earlier"" (he cried btw, he also attempted to massage my abdomen cause it has been hurting and offered me to eat food) which i, all refused.

he said further on, ""i dont even complain"" and i felt really hurt . and i said ""well. damn. thank u so much"" in a hurt way. and started walking faster. he went with me to my house, i was lying on the vehicle wall and it was hurting my head so he put his hand over my head, and i declined that act. he told me he'll pay for the fare and i declined it too and payed for the both of us, i stopped talking after the ""damn tysm"" btw. he told me to calm down ""please"" and offered me if i wanted coffee (its my fave), i only said ""band-aids"" because i had rashes/wounds. he bought some for me, and gave them to me, he told me "" your shoes are broken. "" and i ignored it. i had an empty daze. and i went inside the house without saying goodbye to him. or even looking at him. i was full of anger and pain and i proceeded on crying at home. i checked my messages and i saw that i was still delivered for 10 hours. and he said ""i needed the day for myself"" and ""same"" to the message i sent ""im. done"" and he said ""im sure i said about how i dont like people unsending their messages but its okay"" and after that, i havent replied for 3 days. i couldn't say anything because i was scared that if we proceed on talking, we'll js argue again.",0,1771405986.0,AITAH,21,0.4,False

1r7y6yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r7y6yv/shot_always_sour_sage_barista_express/,Shot always sour!? [Sage Barista Express],"Hi all,

  
I feel like I've tried so many variations, and no matter what, my shot is always sour (at least, I think it is as I'm aware it can be hard to distinguish between sour and bitter). I've avoided posting here for as long as possible whilst trying different combinations and reading other posts, but I'm now at the point where I don't know where to go.

Details from my pull this morning are as follows:

  
Taste: Sour

Roast date: 11/02/26

Roaster: Rave Coffee

Roast level: 4/5 Medium/Dark

Bean details: 100% Arabica (blend) beans from Brazil & Columbia. (RAVE Signature Blend No1)

Dose: 19g

Yield: 38g

Time: 35 seconds (10 seconds pre-infusion) - Steady, what I would consider a decent flow speed.

Post puck: Not wet, comes out with 1 or 2 taps, holds its shape.

Workflow: WDT tool used and a spring loaded tamper. I've increased the temp on the machine  by 4 degrees. Machine on for 5 minutes, and double shot of water run through with portafilter in place to warm up. Inner burr set to 1, outer burr set to 2.

  
I've tried many variations of more/less dose, courser and finer grind, more/less yield, higher/lower pre-infusion times, different tamp pressure etc etc however the overriding taste always seems to be sour (stirring the shot before tasting). I mostly have latte's so it's not hugely important, however I've become a bit obsessive over the shot taste and it's really starting to become a hobby (addiction).

  
Would really love to hear if anyone has any ideas to help reduce the sour taste. I've yet to run a salami shot, but I'm planning to do one tomorrow.

  
Thanks

This included comparing the market and dealing with different business cultures for negotiations with Chinese manufacturers for specialized equipment (wood wool manufacturing lines).   
  
**Sales & Negotiation:** I have performed the role of an Asset Liquidator, which involved local market analysis to price and sell inventories and negotiating directly with buyers.  
   
**Community Building:** I am a Co-Founder of Prague University Consulting, so I’m quite used to networking as well as the “zero-to-one” phase of a project.

But still invited me to the wedding. Some back story’s , a couple months ago he’s gf was being rude to me so my bf decided to message he’s gf asking what was wrong so he’s gf got offended by the message and told my whole family and siblings that my bf was being rude but I ended up reading the message and my bf was respectful and just ask why she was being rude toward me and maybe it would be best for us to discuss any issue but she told a different story to my family. Anyways me and my brother decided to talk it out during a coffee hang out but nothing was resolved but he just acknowledge that we are both different people. So I felt that it was good that we at least  talked and express some of our feelings.

So afterwards a couple weeks past and my brother and he’s gf were visiting but I noticed my brother was being dry and would even hug me or he’s gf wouldn’t say hi unless I said hi first . This behavior has gone  on for months now and I haven’t heard anything about the wedding. Until now. I got a random text from he’s gf with just a link of the invitation. So I felt kinda weird that they would want me to attend even tho they don’t even try to talk to me. I am conflicted on going or not . So to clear the air I decided to call my brother to ask if he wanted me to go. I called and I asked and he just said “you got an invite but if you wanna go or not that’s on you” so I asked again but he just kept saying the same thing so I told him about how I’ve been feeling but he didn’t want to acknowledge my feeling and continue to go on a rant about how he dislike my bf and doesn’t trust him and how my whole family feels the same way, but to be honest my bf is a great person and he’s only shown respect to me and my family but my family has been rude but he tells me that he’ll be okay but forgives them and doesn’t hold grudges against their behavior.

Anyways my brother wouldn’t go into detail to why he feels that way but my assumption is he feel this ways after my bf texted he’s gf about her behavior toward me. So my brother continue to say that he only care about he’s family (by implying his gf is his only family ) and will protect he’s family, and that he doesn’t worry about the past and doesn’t care about what happen in the past  , we just ended the conversation after that. Now I am conflicted if I should attend to support my brother but by the looks of it my bf isn’t invited and my brother gf family has a tendency of being rude is the past and now they have more of a reason to be rude to me .

I used to have a great relationship with my brother so I am conflicted and hurt about how things have turn out and I care for him and wish he the best but AITA if I decide not to attend the wedding.

Did some reading on slow comt, seemed like the advice is good sensible lifestyle stuff so started with lowering caffeine and adding magnesium glycinate. No major changes but cutting caffeine was a massive improvement for mental health.

Did end up going down the rabbit hole reading up on estrogen metabolism, metabolites, estrogen dominance and even breast cancer diet advice. Currently down to one coffee a day before 9am with breakfast, have just switched to a high fibre diet including fruit, cruciferous and other vegetables (struggling with the quantity of food but hitting fibre intake goals), have lowered stress. All of the above seems reasonable and with studying beauty therapy and nutrition I expect if nothing else there will at least be some changes from my diet improving.

Am wondering 🤔 if anyone else has tried similar things and got results? Do these changes seem like enough to remove estrogen metabolites in a significant way? Expecting to see changes within a month with the gut and gut health taking time to adjust. Currently on 4mg estrodiol valearate injection, once a week, 200mg progesterone daily, estrogen levels last time on 5mg on day 4 was 928 pmol, testosterone completely suppressed from being on cyproterone.

I am a 20yo female, 5'7 and 185lbs. I have no diagnosed illnesses, I do struggle with some heavy anxiety but I am on no prescription medication. I used to be on Sprintec but I stopped about 5 months ago. I use cigarettes and vapes on a waning, but fairly regular basis. Any pain medication I take Tylenol or Aleve and I take them properly. 
 
I have had a headache for like 6-8 weeks now. I'm not one who usually gets migraines and neither of my parents struggle with them. It's not constant, but I'll ususally have a ""flare up"" every few hours. It has a variety of symptoms that look like a migraine - Almost always on the left side of my head and around the eye, with eye strain/pain. Originally I would get sensitivity to light but that has pretty much gone away. I have never experienced the aura, nausea, vision problems, confusion, or ""thunderclaps"" that are typically associated with migraines or any serious medical emergancy.

More recently, it feels as if its radiating from my neck and it tends to be worse after sitting down for long periods of time or laying in certain positions. Almost like the neck pain is reaching over the top of my head and onto my temple and eye, like a very weirdly placed tension headache. The most concerning thing is eating can trigger or make a headache so much worse. Mainly what you would expect, excess carbs and sugar, but I've had it happen multiple times where drinking plain water can trigger an two hour long headache.  

I have lots of ideas and theories on what it could be. Bad posture, too much screen time, nicotine, stress, and food are all big contenders. I work in at a fast paced coffee chain that tends to put a lot of strain on my upper back, shoulders near spine, and my hips/waist and they all hurt fairly consistently. 

I'm reaching out to this sub with two questions: 
1.) Has anyone ever seen anything like my case before? if so, any recommendations on what I could/should be doing to help myself? I'm getting very frustrated and feeling like giving up trying to help it, OTC pain medication like Aleve works wonders but I have a fear of overuse. 

2.) What kind of care would you suggest for this kind of issue? I dont have a primary care provider but I will totally find one if this sounds like a much more serious issue. Or a chiropractor, a therapist, more time in the gym, whatever y'all recommend I'm willing to try. In the best way possible I am way too young to be feeling so bad all the time!!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1r7y1nt,https://i.redd.it/xrp7nzegx7kg1.jpeg,"Get a Taste of  Home with Hotbox Party Trays Anytime, Anywhere at 48 Bistro"," 

Not the usual restaurant that you’d expect to find in a mall or its periphery, [**48 Bistro**](https://www.facebook.com/48bistro.ph) is very much a resto-events place nestled inside the Vista Verde Subdivision in Cainta.

It started as **Carmen's**, a family-owned restaurant serving comfort food created from beloved family recipes passed down through generations. It was, of course, founded by the Pascual siblings, who were born and raised around the kitchen table, united by the simple delight of home-cooked meals prepared by their mother, Carmen.

As the pandemic hit, it was forced to close down. It reopened again at a new address in 2023 at 48^(th) Vista Verde Avenue, thus 48 Bistro was born, and now quite well known to its clientele of students, and other visitors who also happened to just pass by, and became repeat customers.

The restaurant can easily accommodate 100 people if it includes its second-floor function rooms.

Cozy and relaxed resto feel. A very inviting atmosphere where guests feel as comfortable as they would in their own home. The space reflects a sense of everyday comfort where they can enjoy hearty and reasonably priced meals in a relaxed setting. The alfresco area was created for the garden feel and the complete experience of being at home, where they can have their cup of coffee or their *merienda* in true Pinoy fashion with their families and friends.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771404558.0,WWEDivaWorship,0,1.0,False

Previously unforeseen circumstances have made it so that I will only be able to see said friend next weekend (10 days-ish). 

Will they be fine in the fridge until then, if I keep them in a sealed container? Or should I consider enjoying them myself and making a new batch? I know they should probably be fine but am getting kind of anxious.

The filling is homemade salted caramel and coffee ganache (1:1 chocolate to cream ratio, coffee steeped in the cream). The bottoms all seem properly sealed with no leaks/cracks. ",26,1771404302.0,chocolate,5,0.97,False
