Long text, maybe get a coffee before reading. :)

I had some mental health issues in the past years, mainly some form of social anxiety, most likely related to my father passing when I was young. But who knows. The anxiety was bad. Like real bad. Naturally, I wanted to get rid of it, to be finally free. Friends recommended me therapy, but I did not go. Don‚Äòt ask me why. In hindsight I should have given it a shot. But then I wouldn‚Äòt be where I am today. Maybe. Who can tell. 

So where am I today? Thats a fantastic question. The only answer I can give is ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú. But not in a bad way, not at all. I‚Äòve been at ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú before, but this time its different. Accompanied to the ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú is some vague form of optimism. A part in me just feels alright with not knowing. 

Just until recently I thought I knew exactly where I was. My life seemed to go so well - finally! Work, friends, family, even my dating life‚Ä¶all seemed to fall into place. After so much struggle, fear and emotional suffering. I thought I figured it out - how to be free - and I tell you, I was there at 99% freedom. Just the last percent was missing. I just couldn‚Äòt figure out where to put the last piece of the puzzle. Or what that piece even was supposed to be for that matter. 

You see, instead of talking to an expert on anxiety, I tried to figure things out for myself. This got me started with philosophy. 

Stage 1: Enter Stoicism. 
It seemed like Stoicism had all the answers I wanted. The cardinal virtues - especially Courage. I wanted to be courageous. To tackle my fears head on, like a Spartan crushes his foe with his mighty shield. Or the dichotomy of control - deciding whats up to us and what isn‚Äòt. Makes life way easier. While practicing Stoicism helped a lot and gave me valuable insights into my own behavior, it did not ‚Äûcure‚Äú me. I should not have asked to be cured in the first place, but I wanted something else. Now don‚Äòt get me wrong. Stoicism is a beautiful philosophy which I still really enjoy reading about today, and I think its widely misrepresented in todays media. But I just couldn‚Äòt get over my own thinking and anxious behavior. I told myself to be courageous. But when courage was calling, I did not answer. It felt too hard. Fear of failing was too big of an obstacle for me at the time. 

Stage 2: Flowing with Tao.
Taoism always had a certain appeal to me. The ‚Äûgo with the flow‚Äú attitude is something many people aspire to attain, even though for many it will stay out of reach. Just like for myself. Being attached to outcomes will keep you stuck. Taoism, like Stoicism, is a beautiful philosophy with beautiful texts and poems. Trying to let go and letting things go their own way helped me a lot to get rid of some stressors in my life, just like Stoicism did. But eventually I would encounter situations where it seemed impossible for me to just let go. Especially in high stress situations where I had to act immediately. My mind would still create attachments to outcomes and that in turn triggered fear and anxiety. 

Stage 3: Finding Spirituality. 
I was never really open to most of the concepts of modern spirituality. Reading Eckhart Tolles ‚ÄûPower of Now‚Äú made me annoyed faster than you can imagine. I just couldn‚Äòt bear to read it. It seemed odd to me how this could help anybody. But then came a day, which started like any normal Saturday. I went shopping for clothes and all of a sudden had a big panic attack in the store. Somehow I managed to get my shit together, pay and leave. I sat down on a bench and was just overwhelmed with myself. At that moment I somehow got the urge to read The Power of Now again. A part in me just wanted to give it one more try. And this time it hit me like a wall of bricks. It somehow all made sense. There is only the present moment, past and future are creations of the mind. As is all my anxiety and suffering. By now, I read every book he wrote. Multiple times. Every time I got new insights into the workings of my mind, or to be more precise - my ego. This was the biggest step for me yet and my anxiety seemed to be reduced tremendously. 

Step 4: Falling into the Absurd. 
My anxiety was nowhere to be found - or so I thought. Like I said earlier, I was at 99% freedom. Life was going great, but it was still a big effort to stay present in the moment and not let my thoughts get the better of me. Sometimes it still somehow felt like a facade. I made amazing progress and did things I never knew I could. But I was still trying to be free from my suffering. In the back of my mind fear still lingered. The fear of not being good enough, I did good at keeping it at bay though. 
Then it all went upside down. Of all things talking to a girl made me fall back into old behavior patterns. I was talking to this girl I liked and going into the conversation I felt a bit on edge. Like I knew already what was going to happen. I talked to her before a lot of times and all was fine. Just not this one day. It happened. The 99% percent came crushing onto me. My thoughts spiraled and I felt a sense of dread. I wanted to avoid feeling afraid, but couldn‚Äôt. There was nothing dangerous about the situation I found myself in, but it definitely felt like it. My panic was back. All I had worked for so hard, all in vain, I asked myself. Nothing made any sense to me. 

I went home and sat down. I just thought, I got so far, made so much progress. And now? Nothing turned out to be the answer I was looking for. I vividly turned pages in my books, trying to find the one passage that might help me. The one answer, that lets it all make sense. The last piece of the puzzle. The missing 1%. I didn‚Äòt. It got late and eventually I had to go to sleep. I couldn‚Äòt sleep that night, at least not until late. I was afraid to wake up and not know what to do next. How to proceed with my life and not knowing why I cannot move forward. It felt like a major setback. There was just one thought in my mind ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú. But the mind wrenching ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú from the sleepless night before turned into a good ‚ÄûI don‚Äòt know‚Äú in the morning. I knew I just don‚Äòt know and probably never will know. And I felt at peace with that. I finally feel okay with not knowing. 

I feel grateful for the journey and for everything I learned along the way and for all the good but especially the bad experiences. During the time the bad moments felt like they will never end. Like falling down an endless pit. But eventually I landed somewhere. Where? I don‚Äòt know, but I‚Äòm okay with that. I am not afraid to fall deeper anymore. The 99% are gone. But at least it feels like I found the 1%. And this 1% is good enough for me. 

Thank you for reading. Even though my anxiety is currently nowhere to be found, I will still check out therapy though! :)

Pergolas can be modified to fit any budget, allowing for both minimal and extravagant designs.

### DIY Canopy Solutions

Maximizing Space and Functionality in Your Outdoor Cooking Area
---------------------------------------------------------------

Creating an outdoor cooking area that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing can transform your backyard into a culinary paradise. With thoughtful design and planning, you can maximize space while ensuring that your outdoor kitchen meets your needs. Here are several inexpensive ideas to inspire you as you embark on this project.

### Utilizing Vertical Space

When you think about outdoor cooking, the horizontal space often comes to mind. However, maximizing vertical space can significantly enhance functionality. Consider the following tips:

- **Shelving Units:** Install shelves on walls to store spices, utensils, and cooking essentials. This keeps everything within reach while leaving the counter free.
- **Hanging Storage:** Use hooks or racks to hang pots, pans, and tools. Not only does this save space, but it also adds a rustic charm to your outdoor area.
- **Utilize Fences or Walls:** Attach magnetic strips on walls for holding knives or spice containers. This keeps items organized and easily accessible.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

Choosing the right furniture is key to creating a versatile outdoor kitchen. Look for options that serve multiple purposes, such as:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/inexpensive-covered-outdoor-kitchen-ideas  
  
- **Storage Benches:** Use benches with built-in storage for cushions, grilling tools, or seasonings. They provide seating and keep your space clutter-free.
- **Portable Islands:** Invest in a portable island or cart that can serve as a prep station, cooking surface, or an extra table for serving food.
- **Foldable Tables and Chairs:** These can be easily stored away when not in use, helping you to maximize available space.

### Creating Zones in Your Outdoor Kitchen

Defining specific areas for various cooking tasks can optimize your workflow. Here‚Äôs how to create functional zones:

- **Cooking Zone:** This area should include your grill, stovetop, or fire pit. Ensure it‚Äôs close to your prep area for efficiency.
- **Prep Area:** A designated counter space for food preparation should be available. Keep tools and ingredients nearby to streamline the cooking process.
- **Dining Zone:** A comfortable dining area with tables and chairs should be adjacent, encouraging seamless movement from cooking to dining.

### Built-In Features

Adding built-in features can significantly improve functionality without overwhelming your space. Consider these elements:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/inexpensive-covered-outdoor-kitchen-ideas  
  
- **Built-In Grills:** These can save space while enhancing the cooking experience. Built-in models often come with storage drawers or cupboards beneath.
- **Countertops:** Durable, weather-resistant countertops create additional preparation space. Materials like granite or concrete can withstand outdoor elements.
- **Sink Installation:** Having a sink nearby makes cleaning up easier. This additional feature keeps your cooking area neat and tidy.

### Choosing Budget-Friendly Materials

Creating an outdoor kitchen doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank. Look for budget-friendly materials that look great and last long:

- **Reclaimed Wood:** Use reclaimed wood for countertops or furniture to add character without high costs.
- **Concrete Blocks:** They can be used to create sturdy and durable bases for grills or countertops without hefty price tags.
- **DIY Projects:** Consider constructing your own features, such as benches or shelving, to save money and personalize your space.

### Leveraging Natural Elements

Natural elements into your outdoor cooking area can promote a peaceful, inviting atmosphere. Here are a few ideas:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/inexpensive-covered-outdoor-kitchen-ideas  
  
- **Use Plants:** Incorporate herbs or greenery around your space. They not only add beauty but can also be used in cooking for fresh flavors.
- **Natural Screens:** Create privacy with trellises or bamboo screens that can also support climbing plants.
- **Stone Pathways:** Design stone pathways to connect different zones. They enhance flow and add rustic charm.

By carefully planning and incorporating these ideas, you can create an outdoor cooking area that not only maximizes space and functionality but also reflects your personal style. With creativity and resourcefulness, it‚Äôs possible to design the outdoor kitchen of your dreams without overspending.

### Conclusion

Crafting an affordable covered outdoor kitchen can transform your backyard into a culinary oasis, allowing you to enjoy cooking and entertaining in a functional, stylish space. By exploring various creative ideas, from repurposing materials to utilizing space-smart designs, you can create a setup that suits both your budget and lifestyle needs. Think of easy-to-assemble features like an open pavilion with a simple roof, or a handy outdoor island made with second-hand cabinets.

Maximizing space is essential, especially if your area is limited. Consider vertical storage solutions, like shelving units and hanging racks, to keep your essentials organized without taking up precious ground space. Using multi-purpose furniture, such as benches that double as storage, further enhances functionality.

1jthiwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jthiwf/boycotting_things_or_lack_there_of_is_giving_me/,Boycotting things (or lack there of) is giving me anxiety,"Caught in a moral dilemma. Where I live I only have access to satchets of Nestle and Bru coffee. If I want alternatives I need to order the big packages from Amazon. My family consumes quite a lot of Unilever products like Detergents, Shampoos and Dish washing soaps. I have been staunchly against consuming Starbucks (not exactly related to Palestine, I've done my share of research but because their coffee sucks and is overpriced and because of their union issues), Burger Kind and McD. I live in a small town and since oct 7th have given into having dominos around 4  times. I've had mcd twice in 2024. I try to not let my greed take over but sometimes in my head I want to let go just once in a while and eat what will make my heart happy. I'm not a huge fan of fast or street food so I rarely consume it anyway. 

But i feel like by doing the partial boycotting I am satisfying my ego like ""look youre better than others who don't care at all"". I fear if this gets out my one muslim friend will look down on me but I don't want to live in this fear. Honestly, I fear she will think I'm pathetic and other bad things. But why am I letting something like this affect my brain??? Idk it feels like I am overthinking this. Sometimes I think I am letting this superficial thing get to me too much. I can't even enjoy my plate of maggi without feeling guilty. NOT guilty by thinking of the innocent lives lost but because ""if I hypethetically get \*caught\* my friend will look down on me"" It's as if I'm scared of getting caught by mu parent playing games.

I'm 3 days post op. While in the hospital, my room mate was in for his 4th surgery. We got to talking and he gave me his whole story. I will only talk of his 1st and 2nd. Originally he had a GB in 2020. Started at 430, dropped down to 170 within a year. After dropping the weight he began drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes daily. After about a year he noticed he had climbed back to 300lbs. He also noticed a bit of pain in his sternum but thought nothing of it. After going into the doctor some time later to find out why he has been putting on weight, they did an endoscopy and noticed 3 ulcers. One of which was burning through some of his stitches. Went in for another surgery to fix that and had some complications. I'm not going to go further, but I have noticed some posts of people saying after the GB they have gone back to eating normally. 

Please be mindful of the things you put into your body after this and after reaching or exceeding your goal.

This captivating contrast is the heart of Soft Brutalism, the interior design trend unexpectedly storming into the spotlight for 2025. Forget stark, cold spaces ‚Äì this is Brutalism reimagined with a welcoming, human touch.

From Instagram feeds to design magazines and stylish neighborhood lofts, [Soft Brutalism](https://weandthecolor.com/soft-brutalism-the-hottest-interior-design-trend-you-didnt-see-coming/201587) is making its mark. It skilfully blends the unapologetic honesty of industrial architecture with a layer of warmth and comfort that feels utterly current and deeply inviting. How did a style born from imposing, post-war structures become so livable? Let's dive in.

**What Exactly Is Soft Brutalism?**

At its core, Soft Brutalism borrows the foundational elements of traditional Brutalist architecture ‚Äì think exposed concrete, steel beams, and strong geometric forms. But where original Brutalism (emerging in the 1950s) prioritized function and raw utility, often feeling imposing, Soft Brutalism rewrites the narrative.

It retains the raw, honest materials and forms but layers them with elements of softness and comfort:

* **Tactile Textiles:** Think plush velvet, chunky knit throws, boucle fabrics, and soft rugs.
* **Natural Materials:** Warm wood accents, leather furnishings, and stone details provide organic counterpoints.
* **Softer Palettes:** While grounded in neutrals like grey and beige, it incorporates pops of warmer hues like terracotta, mustard yellow, or sage green.
* **Ambient Lighting:** Warm, inviting light from statement pendants or minimalist lamps replaces harsh, functional lighting.

The result is a space that feels both grounded and luxurious, edgy yet cozy ‚Äì a sophisticated balance of seemingly opposite forces.

**Why Is Soft Brutalism Everywhere in 2025?**

This trend isn't emerging in a vacuum. Several factors contribute to its current appeal:

1. **A Craving for Authenticity:** After years dominated by sleek minimalism and mass-produced perfection, there's a collective desire for spaces with personality and tactile reality. Soft Brutalism feels honest and unpretentious.
2. **Sustainability Focus:** The emphasis on raw, exposed materials like concrete and the potential use of reclaimed wood aligns with growing eco-consciousness. It's a style that can look sustainable without feeling forced.
3. **Modern Nostalgia:** It taps into a fascination with mid-century aesthetics but updates the sometimes-harsh Brutalist look for contemporary living, making it feel both familiar and fresh.
4. **The ""Wow"" Factor:** The inherent contrast is visually compelling and highly photogenic, making it a natural fit for the age of social media (hello, #softbrutalism on Pinterest and Instagram).
5. **The Perfect Balance:** It avoids the potential coldness of pure minimalism and the sometimes-cluttered feel of boho or maximalism. It hits a sweet spot ‚Äì structured yet soulful.

**How to Bring Soft Brutalism Home**

Ready to embrace the trend? It's more achievable than you might think:

* **Start with Texture:** Introduce raw elements. Exposed brick or concrete walls are ideal (faux options like peel-and-stick wallpaper work well too).
* **Layer in Softness:** Contrast the hard surfaces with soft furnishings. A deep, comfortable sofa, velvet armchairs, thick rugs, and cozy throws are essential.
* **Focus on Lighting:** Opt for warm, ambient lighting. Think Edison bulbs, sculptural floor lamps, or pendants that cast a soft glow.
* **Choose a Grounded Palette (with a Twist):** Stick mainly to neutrals (greys, beiges, concrete tones) but add warmth through wood tones and accent colors like deep greens, terracotta, or ochre.
* **Select Furniture with Character:** Look for pieces with strong, defined shapes (blocky coffee tables, angular shelves) but crafted from natural materials like wood or leather.
* **Personalize:** Add warmth with plants, incorporate meaningful art, or display unique objects that reflect your personality.

**Finding Your Inspiration**

Need ideas? Search ""soft brutalism"" on Instagram, Pinterest, or X (formerly Twitter). Design platforms like Dezeen and Dwell often showcase professional examples. Even local cafes and boutiques are adopting the look. For deeper dives, explore books on Brutalist architecture and contemporary design magazines like Kinfolk for that blend of raw and refined.

**Why You'll Fall for Soft Brutalism**

More than just a fleeting trend, Soft Brutalism is a mood. It creates spaces that feel curated yet comfortable, sophisticated yet lived-in. It appeals to design lovers seeking depth and character, and to anyone tired of predictable interiors. It's adaptable, shareable, and offers a unique way to express personal style.

¬†I‚Äôve been diagnosed with‚ÄØterminal cancer. That‚Äôs the bad news.

The good news is ‚Äì I‚Äôve just been given medical clearance to travel again.

So now I‚Äôm using the time I have left to create something that really matters: a documentary series called *Everything Beyond*.

Each chapter of this journey is shared with someone I love ‚Äì this time, I‚Äôm traveling with my little brother ‚Äì and as always, I‚Äôm joined by my dedicated cameraman, who captures everything we experience.

Together, we‚Äôre documenting **life, death, belief, and all the strange and beautiful things in between** ‚Äì in the hope that these stories will live on, even if I don‚Äôt.

Now it‚Äôs time for our next chapter: Romania. **From‚ÄØApril 23‚Äì30**, we‚Äôll be filming across **Bucharest, Prahova, Bra»ôov, Sighi»ôoara and Cluj**, and we‚Äôre looking for people who‚Äôd be open to sharing a moment with us. That could mean:

* Inviting us in for **a home-cooked dinner**¬†
* Helping us connect with **Roma families**, **healers**, **aura readers**, **fortune tellers**
* Pointing us to **villages or elders** who still carry local beliefs and rituals
* Or just joining us for a walk, a story, or a coffee

This is a personal, respectful, and heartfelt project. The documentary has two purposes:

**1. To seek healing ‚Äì physical, emotional, and spiritual ‚Äì now that doctors have given up and I have less than a year left to live.**

**2. To create unforgettable memories with someone I love ‚Äì memories they can look back on 20 or 30 years from now, when I might no longer be here.**

# What we offer:

We bring **good energy**, **Danish snacks** (yes, liquorice pipes ), and an **open heart**. Everything is filmed with a professional team (ex-DR / Danish national broadcaster), and we‚Äôre always happy to **blur faces or skip filming** if that‚Äôs what you prefer.

We completely understand that some of these experiences may **not be free** ‚Äì especially when it comes to traditional healing, rituals, or time spent.

We‚Äôre **ready to contribute** ‚Äì and we truly want to meet people who **believe they can help**, whether through **energy work, rituals, herbs, blessings or conversation**.

This isn‚Äôt about proving anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs about being open to what the world still holds.

# What we‚Äôre hoping for:

* Local connections ‚Äì anyone who can help us get in touch with healers, elders, Roma families, spiritual people, etc.

* Families or individuals who‚Äôd like to invite us for a simple **traditional dinner and conversation**

* Anyone open to just **sharing something real**

* A local translator or guide who can join us in some of the locations ‚Äì someone who understands both language and culture, and who can help us connect more deeply with the people we meet¬†

* The chance to join a local celebration or gathering ‚Äì if there‚Äôs a **festival, party or traditional event** happening, we‚Äôd love to experience it

* **Suggestions for local experiences ‚Äì if there‚Äôs something unique, strange, meaningful or beautiful you think we should try, we‚Äôre all ears**

We just came back from Tanzania, where we met three traditional witch doctors. I even entered a trance during one of the ceremonies ‚Äì something I still can‚Äôt fully explain. Whether it was spiritual, psychological or something in between. To me **some things can‚Äôt be measured ‚Äì only felt**.

We‚Äôll be forever grateful ‚Äì and you‚Äôll become part of something that, hopefully, lasts far beyond me.

If this resonates with you or someone you know, feel free to comment here or write me directly:¬†

I have a slight outline of what I want the 1-bedroom apartment that my wife and I will be moving into in less than 3 days (23M and 23F). Potential stuff I'm thinking of buying 2 months into the move, (recovering from 1st month and deposit in Norcal, CA lol). We'll probably be here for 2-3 years since her school is close to the apartment, so I want more ideas and perspectives on how I can change the layout that I have 0 knowledge of how to put together. 

My biggest problems right now are how I should organize the 2 desks that we have. We need both since I have a desktop with 2 monitors, and she needs a place to work/ study. The second photo is inspiration for a dream of how we want our future home to look like with warm light at different levels, since the walls are very white but the floor is a glossed wooden finish. We have 2 lamps so we'll probably put one in the bedroom with a potential nightstand and an additional small lamp, and another lamp by the thin and tall heater in the living room.

Thankfully most of my pens are inexpensive so I was comfortable with this experiment! There are not many reviews out there for these inks, so please enjoy my poor attempt at a mini one.

I chose inks that are part of my usual palette, i.e.: grey, purple, pink. They all behave really well and are sufficiently wet. 
I haven‚Äôt had any clogs or dry outs, even on the Jinhao 10, but occasionally there will be a hard start, particularly with the Violet Raccoon ink. Once it gets going, which doesn‚Äôt take anything more than going over the letter a second time, it flows as normal, so the glitch is not due to dry out -probably pigment blocking the feed temporarily. 
I haven‚Äôt noticed no bleeding or feathering on any of the papers I use, including some generic paper our work assessments are printed on.
I haven‚Äôt had no issues cleaning the inks from the pens -albeit the Violet Giraffe is a bit stubborn and required a few minutes of soaking in soapy water.

Overall, I love these inks! The colours lack the depth of dye-based inks in my opinion; they tend to dry quite flat but that could just be the colours I chose.",4,1744017726.0,fountainpens,2,1.0,False

1jth1fc,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/haunting-generations-true-horror-story/,The Haunting Across Generations | A True Horror Story - Paranormaldergi.com,"Actually, it all started many, many years ago, though I only recently learned how far back these events go.

Before I was born, my grandmother and grandfather lived in a village in Bursa (I won‚Äôt name the village). My grandfather liked my grandmother and wanted to marry her. My grandmother‚Äôs family accepted, and the two young people were married. However, my grandfather‚Äôs mother (my great-grandmother) never wanted my grandmother. According to my mother, her mother-in-law made her suffer greatly.

My grandfather and grandmother moved from the village they lived in and built a house for themselves closer to the city center. That house had only two rooms. Between the two rooms was a hall, but the other sides of the hall were open, and there weren‚Äôt many houses around. The inside of the house faced the fields. A few years later, rooms were built on these sides too, but before the rooms were built, my grandmother used to tell us that dogs would stand in this hall at night.

A few years after getting married, my grandfather suddenly changed; he would beat my grandmother, curse at her, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get out of this house!‚Äù This went on for years. Anyway, some time passed, and my mother was born. One night, my mother says beings came to take her (my mother), but she repelled them by reciting prayers, and even my grandfather saw them.

One day, 9-10 people get into a minibus to go to the village; it‚Äôs a crowd. While returning late at night, two goats come running towards the minibus. Our relative driving the minibus stops it and tells them not to get out. While the goats stand in front of the minibus, my grandmother recites prayers, and the goats suddenly disappear as if they were never there.

Years after this incident, when my mother was in her 20s, she started smoking. When my grandmother left the house, she would post my aunt as a lookout at the garden gate and smoke in the garden. One day, my grandmother and others went to the market, telling my mother to make tea. My mother took the old teapot and went out into the garden. Telling my aunt to wait at the gate, she smoked her cigarette. After finishing, she poured the teapot‚Äôs contents under the tree. Of course, this is where the events started.

My mother began having terrible nightmares, waking up to see a tall shadow watching her at the door. This continued for months. Wherever she went, that shadow came with her. She also started waking up with pains in her back and shoulder, eventually unable to sit upright. When she entered the bathroom, she felt as if someone else was bathing with her. My aunt also felt the presence of this shadow and felt uneasy, but couldn‚Äôt see the shadow. Also, my mother started reading fortunes (fal), and whatever she said came true. She tells a friend she‚Äôs being cheated on by her boyfriend; the girl comes to my mother crying the next day. It was that serious.

One day, my mother told my grandmother what she was experiencing. My grandmother mentioned a woman she knew who dealt with such matters, convinced my mother that going to her might help, and they went to this woman. The woman was sitting on the floor in the middle of a room. She called my mother over, had her sit opposite, and listened to everything. My mother asked the reason for what she was experiencing. The woman said, ‚ÄúThere is a house, an empty garden. In this garden, there is a tree‚Ä¶ Under that tree, a family is eating. You poured a teapot (of tea) onto that meal and disrupted their meal.‚Äù My mother was terrified, of course, and when she asked who these people were, the woman said, ‚ÄúYou would never want to know.‚Äù The woman also asked my mother, ‚ÄúDo you read fortunes?‚Äù My mother confirmed. The woman said, ‚ÄúYou are dealing with wrong things, stop it,‚Äù and my mother‚Äôs fortune-telling chapter closed that day. I sometimes insist my mother read my fortune, ‚ÄúPlease read my fortune,‚Äù but I have never seen her touch a coffee cup (for fortune-telling) since.

Amulets are written, prayers are read. My mother mentions the pains in her shoulder. The woman smiles and says that one of them sits on my mother‚Äôs shoulders all day long, and the pain stems from that. After my mother told me these things, I asked her if she was ever curious about who that black shadow was. ‚ÄúI never wanted to find out,‚Äù she said.

Anyway, my mother and grandmother return home, and my mother never sees the shadow again. The pain in her shoulders also goes away, but she occasionally feels its presence. The events don‚Äôt end, though. My mother starts seeing things in her dreams this time, but not scary things. If someone talks about her or if something significant is about to happen in her life, my mother sees it in her dreams. (As a note: She told me which university I would attend months in advance.)

My mother and aunt got married. Occasionally, in the dead of night, my mother would have a dream or sense something and immediately call my aunt. Or the exact opposite would happen; my aunt would call my mother. Both of them would definitely experience something on the same day. Also, according to what that woman said, because my aunt was also present where my mother poured the teapot, they were bothering her too.

Some time passes. One day, my two aunts, my mother, and all their husbands are having dinner at my grandmother‚Äôs. My grandfather is stern as always. My uncle-in-law, while fetching my grandfather‚Äôs jacket, accidentally notices something inside the lining of the jacket and tells my aunt. They open the lining in the kitchen; a piece of paper almost the size of a dining table comes out of the jacket! The jacket was a gift to my grandfather from his mother. On the paper, there are drawn human figures, a photograph of my grandfather and grandmother, and writings in Arabic! My grandfather is shocked when he sees this and doesn‚Äôt speak to his mother for years after this incident. When my grandfather‚Äôs mother visited them, my grandfather even got very angry at my grandmother for letting the woman into the house.

A few more years pass, a phone call comes from √áanakkale: the news of my grandfather‚Äôs mother‚Äôs death. My grandfather doesn‚Äôt want to go to the funeral, but my grandmother forces him to go. According to what my grandfather heard there, they couldn‚Äôt get the body out of the house through the door. Although the body was found the day after death, it had started to smell as if it had decayed in a single day, despite it being winter. Think about that. My grandfather doesn‚Äôt offer prayers for her soul; I‚Äôve never heard him speak her name, not even mention her. And I don‚Äôt really ask either.

Now let‚Äôs get to what I experienced. After my mother went through these events, she started getting interested in these subjects, reading books, and learning some prayers. After experiencing problems with my father, she decided to solve these problems this way. Since I didn‚Äôt really believe in these things and was angry at those who dealt with them, my mother told me about this years later.

Around the time my mother started dealing with these things, I was 16 years old. Right around then, I felt that there was someone else existing within me. When I thought about something or did something, even tying my shoes, that inner voice constantly talked to me. It told me what I should do, what I should say. Sometimes I sensed events before they happened; I knew what my friends were talking about me even though I hadn‚Äôt heard them.

One night, between sleep and wakefulness, I felt a breath on the back of my neck. It was as if someone was whispering things into my ear, but I couldn‚Äôt understand what was being said. On one hand, I was trying to recall the prayers that came to mind; on the other, I was struggling to regulate my pulse and not be afraid. I was about to start reciting Ayetel Kursi when that entity grabbed my left wrist and shouted ‚ÄúBulut!‚Äù (Cloud/Maybe a name?). It squeezed my wrist so tightly that I still remember the pain even now. After saying that, I fell into a much deeper sleep. The next morning, on my way to school, I noticed the bruise on my left wrist and only told my closest friend about it. My wrist was bruised as if squeezed tightly by all fingers. Now I wish I had taken a picture of the bruise because it wasn‚Äôt something I could have done by hitting somewhere or injuring my wrist.

Again, some time passes. My father starts behaving irrationally, like someone he‚Äôs never been. I can say this because I witnessed it closely. The marriage of the couple who were in love, whom everyone looked up to with envy, who hadn‚Äôt compromised on their happiness or love for all these years, was crumbling. My father is out every day, never comes home. He starts locking doors; at home, he doesn‚Äôt talk to us at all, doesn‚Äôt answer stories or questions. I used to think my father was cheating on my mother, that‚Äôs why he behaved like that.

After some time, my aunt and grandmother mentioned a hoca (retired imam) in Bursa Mustafakemalpa≈üa. They went there thinking maybe he could do something for my father. I was 19 at this time, the period when I was completely afraid of religion. The man, while talking to my mother, mentioned some details that only our family knew. He gave my mother and aunt a glass of water each, told them to wait outside and drink the water while waiting. While my mother and aunt were drinking water outside, shouting sounds in a different language were coming from inside. The man called my mother and the others in. Later, my mother said that the man they saw when they entered the room was not the same person they saw after drinking the water; his gaze and movements had changed. The man said that some people in my father‚Äôs family dealt with certain spells and that these spells had affected us. Exactly as my mother had guessed! He said she needed to bring my father there, that both of us (narrator and father) were in a bad state, and if she didn‚Äôt bring him, worse things would happen to both of us. The man recited some prayers, wrote some papers, and gave these papers to my mother. He also put a few papers into a bottle of water and said, ‚ÄúYou will make him drink this too; if you can‚Äôt make him drink it, put it in his food, but be careful, there‚Äôs a child in the house, make sure it doesn‚Äôt reach him.‚Äù The child he referred to was, of course, my 12-year-old sibling.

My mother couldn‚Äôt convince either my father or me to go there. She never told me about the water that needed to be drunk, probably because she thought I wouldn‚Äôt drink it, but she must have administered it somehow. My father doesn‚Äôt believe in such things, and if he experienced anything, he never told us. And I felt an inexplicable hatred towards that man. Can a person hate someone they‚Äôve never met? I don‚Äôt know, but whenever this man was mentioned, my facial muscles twitched.

A year later, my mother and I left that house and moved into another one. It was a very hot summer day. My sibling, my mother, and I were sleeping in the living room because it had air conditioning. A few hours after falling asleep that night, on that hot summer night, I inexplicably left the room and lay face down on the bed in the back room. My feet were hanging off the bed. I hadn‚Äôt fully fallen asleep yet; the door to the room opened, and someone entered. I could hear footsteps behind me, but I couldn‚Äôt move; I couldn‚Äôt even open my eyes! The person coming from behind placed wet clothes on my feet and said, ‚ÄúYour mother didn‚Äôt wash the clothes!‚Äù Then laughed and left. But believe me, that creepy laugh still rings in my ears! After that entity left, I immediately got up and checked my feet, but there was nothing there. The next day, I told my mother about this. She laughed and said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt manage it.‚Äù Turns out, my mother had sought help from them through various sessions that night. According to her, she recited Ayetel Kursi to keep them away from the room we were sleeping in. After I experienced this incident, my mother also experienced a few things and stopped dealing with these matters.

But I sometimes read fortunes (fal) for close friends; most of the time, what I say comes true. Sometimes I can sense future events or what is being said about me. At night, I feel someone watching me at the head of my bed; I hear goat sounds from the backyard, but I don‚Äôt feel any fear. Maybe because I‚Äôve lived with these for years, it seems ordinary to me now. My mother still communicates with my aunt when she senses something. When I sense something, I tell my mother or aunt. I don‚Äôt know why, but on the same day, at the same time, something happens to all three of us. I think I‚Äôve gotten used to the situation now; I‚Äôm not as scared as before.

We talked with my mother again recently; we think there‚Äôs no prosperity (bereket) in our house, that everything we do goes wrong. Not just us, of course, my grandmother‚Äôs and aunts‚Äô families too‚Ä¶ We have two or three fields in the village; all the villagers got rich from these fields, we haven‚Äôt even been able to buy a car yet. I don‚Äôt know why.

But recently, my gf came up with an idea, that they wanna meet after work and drink a coffee. I'm not against male-female friendship, but it's clearly NO to me. I expressed my feelings and there were a huge argument between us. At the beginning of our relationship we laid down the rules, and she has all the right to meet her male friends, but there are cases which are not ok for me.

So, we had a huge argument and she felt that I'm ready to break up, so she halted the argument and didn't meet him. She even told me that I can be there, but honestly, I don't really wanna meet this guy.

Weeks passed and I thought that we solved this, but we did not. Today, she asked for a permission to meet him at the weekend. I really don't know why he is so important to her, she has a ton of other friends, and I feel like she is gambling with our relationship.

I‚Äôve been told I may fail my probation due to a couple of unfair terms in my opinion (I‚Äôve never had happen in any job before). My probation runs out at the start of May, so I may be let go from this role a couple of weeks after the wedding anyway.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with‚ÄØterminal cancer. That‚Äôs the bad news.

The good news is ‚Äì I‚Äôve just been given medical clearance to travel again.

So now I‚Äôm using the time I have left to create something that really matters: a documentary series called *Everything Beyond*.

Each chapter of this journey is shared with someone I love ‚Äì this time, I‚Äôm traveling with my little brother ‚Äì and as always, I‚Äôm joined by my dedicated cameraman, who captures everything we experience.

Together, we‚Äôre documenting **life, death, belief, and all the strange and beautiful things in between** ‚Äì in the hope that these stories will live on, even if I don‚Äôt.

Now it‚Äôs time for our next chapter: Romania. **From‚ÄØApril 23‚Äì30**, we‚Äôll be filming across **Bucharest, Prahova, Bra»ôov, Sighi»ôoara and Cluj**, and we‚Äôre looking for people who‚Äôd be open to sharing a moment with us. That could mean:

* Inviting us in for **a home-cooked dinner**¬†
* Helping us connect with **Roma families**, **healers**, **aura readers**, **fortune tellers**
* Pointing us to **villages or elders** who still carry local beliefs and rituals
* Or just joining us for a walk, a story, or a coffee

This is a personal, respectful, and heartfelt project. The documentary has two purposes:

**1. To seek healing ‚Äì physical, emotional, and spiritual ‚Äì now that doctors have given up and I have less than a year left to live.**

**2. To create unforgettable memories with someone I love ‚Äì memories they can look back on 20 or 30 years from now, when I might no longer be here.**

# What we offer:

We bring **good energy**, **Danish snacks** (yes, liquorice pipes ), and an **open heart**. Everything is filmed with a professional team (ex-DR / Danish national broadcaster), and we‚Äôre always happy to **blur faces or skip filming** if that‚Äôs what you prefer.

We completely understand that some of these experiences may **not be free** ‚Äì especially when it comes to traditional healing, rituals, or time spent.

We‚Äôre **ready to contribute** ‚Äì and we truly want to meet people who **believe they can help**, whether through **energy work, rituals, herbs, blessings or conversation**.

This isn‚Äôt about proving anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs about being open to what the world still holds.

# What we‚Äôre hoping for:

* Local connections ‚Äì anyone who can help us get in touch with healers, elders, Roma families, spiritual people, etc.

* Families or individuals who‚Äôd like to invite us for a simple **traditional dinner and conversation**

* Anyone open to just **sharing something real**

* A local translator or guide who can join us in some of the locations ‚Äì someone who understands both language and culture, and who can help us connect more deeply with the people we meet¬†

* The chance to join a local celebration or gathering ‚Äì if there‚Äôs a **festival, party or traditional event** happening, we‚Äôd love to experience it

* **Suggestions for local experiences ‚Äì if there‚Äôs something unique, strange, meaningful or beautiful you think we should try, we‚Äôre all ears**

We just came back from Tanzania, where we met three traditional witch doctors. I even entered a trance during one of the ceremonies ‚Äì something I still can‚Äôt fully explain. Whether it was spiritual, psychological or something in between. To me **some things can‚Äôt be measured ‚Äì only felt**.

We‚Äôll be forever grateful ‚Äì and you‚Äôll become part of something that, hopefully, lasts far beyond me.

when i got hired last year, the fantasy i built in my mind of what this job looks like absolutely shattered. 

i am currently an all rounder, so i serve/run food and coffees/chef 
it is all so extremely overwhelming and 2 of our staff quit and left us extremely understaffed.

the days we get slammed are the worst. i find myself making more mistakes than usual and doing the job of 2/3 people! 

today i found out i made a HUGE mistake and left out 30kg of meat outside the freezer. apparently the lady has been crying and been inconsolable and im so scared for my shift tomorrow. 

i literally get anxiety thinking about work and the impending doom of my shift even on my days off! they‚Äôve made it clear i‚Äôm invaluable and i understand leaving them would put them in a difficult position. I‚Äôm thinking of starting to plan for my exit sometime end of this year regardless. 

being a 2nd year uni student too doesn‚Äôt make this easier. my life has become consumed by this and i hate it.

Please excuse my English.

I am not entirely sure if this was spoken here before,  but I feel like the office, and other shows for that matter, put some expectation for what working in general would be. I am sure some of you probably thought the same.

I'm not talking about office romances alone, but being friendly, unexpected and actually making connections on the workspace! Having the ocasional laugh when your coworkers do something unexpected, that thing that makes you think: hey... maybe going to work tomorrow will be kinda cool.

Ooooh how that was a lie.

Modern workspaces are filled with a coldness and distance that makes it so much worse. Everybody hates everybody, nobody speaks or share stuff, much less make anything that resembles the sitcoms that made me grow up dreaming of these jobs.

Maybe it is just with me, I'm the fluke and got a lot of bad jobs with boring, bad people... but I'd love to hear someone's opinion on this! And much, much more, stories of jobs with something close to the office.

It started about 5 months ago after overeating, before that i used to drink a lot of alcohol, coffee, NSAID, etc

My symptoms were different over time: nausa, heartburn, upper abdomen pain, pain on left or right side of ribcage, sometimes spreading to arm, back pain, on better days i only feel lump in throat

Also they were triggered by fatty, acidic food, rice, all kind of legumes, for some reason alcohol and chocolate are not giving me any of these symptoms, even i felt better after them, but i still avoid them

Bland diet and PPi are helping me but i never made it to the end, always small mistake setting me back. 

Had stool test for H. Pilori, blood, fungus, abdominal ultrasound, biochemistry of blood, urine, they were all good

2 months ago had gastroscopy, doctor said he haven't seen anything wrong, he mentioned that i have small hernia that might have caused this, in report he wrote just GERD grade A, also he did H. Pilori test, it was negative. 

Went to another doctor said all this is neurogical, i'm anxious sometimes, but not that much

Is it possible that just small hernia caused all this? 

Also i'm 20 year old male, never experienced anything similiar

""John here, still alive, still sane... Well, mostly.  Anyway, it's day 182, everything is fine, stable, the asteroid still yields the expected amount of titanium. Minor stability issues due to internal structure. The thing has some holes in it, thank you for not mentioning that, assholes... Proceeding as planned. Oh, and note to myself, next time pack more whiskey and holo-tapes, you idiot. I'm bored out of my mind already...""

I end the recording, adding yet another entry to the growing pile that probably no one will look at once I'm back again, as long as I deliver the goods. I light a cigarette, pushing the capacity of the air filters, taking a deep, satisfying drag as I glance out the window. The robust, metallic arms of the Demeter hold the eerie space-rock with a vice grip, drilling deeper and deeper into it in search of precious titanium. I frown again, the sight kinda reminding me of slaughter. But just as I step away to reach for my mug of coffee, a bright, orange light flickers to life on the console. Cursing under my breath, I type away on the keyboard to bring up what the warning is about, my expression changing from frustrated to confused quickly.

""What the... You gotta be kidding me.""

I murmur, trying to make sense of the readings that can't be right. I hurriedly put on my overalls and head down to the cargo bay, but the ship suddenly rattles so hard, I fall down the last few steps, face first.

""Son of a...""

I curse as I push myself up, knees and elbows throbbing with pain, but I don't stop. With a slight limp, I hurry down the dimly lit corridor, my forehead slick with sweat as the fear and urgency in my gut churns. The Demeter rattles again, throwing me into the wall, the scream of metal twisting, breaking coming from the cargo bay. The safety mechanism locks the door for good, signaling a breach in the hull on the other side.

""No no NO!""

I turn around and run back into the cockpit, frantically tapping away on the consoles to reach someone, lights of red and orange blinking around me, but I freeze as I hear it.

we live in a one room apartment ‚Äî it's just me and him, and we live in a very nature heavy area, so we take lots of walks and there's a largely unused dog park next door that we take advantage of as well. he is offered mental enrichment through training, puzzles, flirt pole, and slow feeding options.

here are the issues:
‚Äî biting. he's been teething for a while and most if not all of his baby teeth seem to have come out, however he's started to jump up at me and bite me on walks/whenever we're outside. he won't listen to his commands during these episodes either.

‚Äî barking at objects. he barks and lunges at the usual collie things (cars, bikes, people etc. which we're working on and is improving slowly), but he's also started barking at objects around the house he dislikes. the tv is a major one ‚Äî he'll stand and bark at it nonstop. it's a similar situation when it comes to the coffee maker and sodastream.

That's like more than a 200% difference. And then on top of that i am expected to treat you to vacations and to spoil you. And on top of all of that i already feel like i recieve hardly any recognition for paying the rent, the electricity, the insurance, the water, the food, the paper towels, the toilet paper, the soap, the shampoo, the conditioner, etc. I've always expressed that I want an equal partnership and that extends to all aspects of a relationship. Equality is a deeply rooted principle of mine. It is the fundamental rule upon which I form all of my thoughts. I have tried to make that very clear, and given that, as well as the fact that I have voiced that I feel unappreciated for the money that I do and have spent, has left me rather dumbfounded as to the immense disrespect that suggesting such an inequality has brought upon me. At first I couldn't even comprehend what exactly it was that you meant when you said that. I thought that maybe you wanted to contribute this money in addition to a 50/50 split, which in my eyes, would have been entirely ridiculous. Instead, I have come to realize that what you really meant to suggest was a +200% economical inequality despite the fact that I have greatly sacrificed in my own financial success, and in my own needs and wants in order to provide a living space for you where you have access to the things that you both want and need. I acknowledge that in recent I have not been perfect in this regard. You have bought yourself coffee, you have bought yourself sushi, and rice, and snacks, and otherwise a handful of other things that you have wanted, all of which I really appreciate, but in my eyes, given that you, and I, are not inherently entitled by any means to each other's financial successes, the burden upon me to get you any of these things has been none. And yet I have still, in the past, and (somewhat) in the present, elected to indulge you in these things. Given this, I strongly feel that my contributions have been massively taken for granted, and I am greatly offended by your suggestion. I appreciate that you are ""ok"" with doing 50/50, I heard you when you said this, but I don't feel it. I don't feel like it will be appreciated, I don't feel as though you will be okay with it.

I initially consulted them for extreme insomnia, not for anything related to Schizoid Personality Disorder. But both eventually reached that conclusion.

As far as I know, there‚Äôs no cure. They prescribed me 300mg of Seroquel because I was staying awake for 100+ hours and had to be taken to the emergency room. The root cause was 100% work-related stress.

After I lost my job (they didn‚Äôt patch a problem and I ‚Äúquit‚Äù), it took about a year for my sleep to normalize. Luckily, I had money saved‚ÄîI‚Äôve always lived with a fear mindset, saving 50% of everything, constantly thinking, ""I could lose my job at any moment."" I was living frugally and preparing for collapse every day.

I don‚Äôt have friends. No family relationships either. I treated colleagues as colleagues. After 3 months, I‚Äôd usually find them stupid. I started micromanaging them‚Äîeven the project manager‚Äîand reviewed every tester‚Äôs work myself. I was clocking 100+ hour work weeks. I lived and breathed work for a full year.

My only ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù were in the last 3 hours of each day, where I‚Äôd down a 6-pack and 2-3 generic Benadryls to try to sleep.

I‚Äôve been researching Schizoid traits, but the complication is this: I have a massive ego. I want to control people‚Äîif they‚Äôre incompetent. And if someone criticizes me, I want payback. I‚Äôm immune to compliments, but in a weird way‚Äîlike, ""Who are you to compliment me?""

Emotionally, I go through long flat periods. Then it hits like a wave: I stop sleeping, become semi-aggressive, micromanage everything, and develop hate toward every coworker. After about 3 months, I find flaws in all of them and can‚Äôt stand anyone‚Äîthe ‚Äúhoneymoon period‚Äù ends.

I‚Äôm also paranoid and deal with three distinct types of anxiety. For example:

I‚Äôd investigate which employees had two jobs (found several, reported them).

I reported every single security incident.

I acted like the project lead, but I was just a junior.

In meetings, I spoke more than anyone else‚Äîdespite social anxiety (I was 6 beers deep, hidden in coffee mugs).

Eventually, I started burning out. The project manager told me, ""You can work alone. Don‚Äôt talk to anyone‚Äîthey‚Äôre scared of you. If you need something, ask me directly."" I was producing 3x the output of the second-best employee. But I ignored all that and kept bypassing him.

Outside of work, I‚Äôve been completely alone for 20 years. My real-life social interaction amounts to 5‚Äì10 minutes per month. I‚Äôm also asexual. When asked about it, I was like, ""Why do they even care?"" They asked if I wanted a partner. I said no‚ÄîI don‚Äôt care. If something happens, fine. But I‚Äôm not putting even 1% effort into that.

I‚Äôm also extremely direct. If someone screws up, I tell them.

I know this is gonna come off at some high school drama stuff that we shouldn‚Äôt even be concerned about, but this has been going on the last two years and I‚Äôm still holding anger and trying to find a way to let go and all honestly I don‚Äôt wanna be anger about this and after all this, I just need to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong.  


During the pandemic, me and my best friend or single and out there mingling. We were both going through a hard times in our lives me going through a break up with a long-term relationship and her fighting custody with her only child. We found comfort and support in each other. We even lived with each other for about six months I had offered her to stay in our extra room for $400 a month. We got really close, and I thought I could trust her so I told her a lot of personal information such as me being scared I‚Äôm not gonna find anyone in life or that I‚Äôm unlovable or that I‚Äôm not gonna be able to have kids. Come to find out she all uses this against me later on. Now for the first three months of us living together, you did not have her pay rent because she didn‚Äôt have a job and I said to her wait until she gets the job and gets settled and then she can start paying rent. As the months went on, she finally got a job and did not mention anything about rent and started spending her first paycheck immediately. The first week of the month I went into a room and said hey could you pay $400 for rent? She looked at me very disappointed and said that she already had everything allocated and that I should‚Äôve told her sooner. I said no problem just make payments and we can start fresh next month. We were going out a lot while we were living together and we ended up meeting the security guard at a bar that we went to very frequently now, some very important information My friend is polyamorous and I‚Äôve always supported her. I don‚Äôt judge her, but I am very monogamous and little selfish and I like my person being my person only. I didn‚Äôt think we were gonna have issues in that department, but here came the very first issue. She had the a crush on the security guard and talked frequently about wanting to hook up with him. She would flirt with him and get his contact information, but they hadn‚Äôt hooked up and she was telling everyone at the bar how she wanted to get with him. I think this got back to him. He ended walking up to me one night and telling me ‚Äúhe did not want to hook up with my friend.‚Äù I looked at him and said you probably should go tell her that then. He never ended up telling her and even asked to hang out with me. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and I hung out and watched a movie with him. We did not hook up. It was not a big deal because I did not think we were a good match. And nothing ever went on between us. I did talk to my friend about hanging out with him. She knew what was going on the whole time and said she was fine with it. About a week later we went out again we ended up out until the bar ended up closing, and we hung out my car and we were talking to him when he asked us where you‚Äôre about to do I told him I was gonna go home and sleep and while she said, she was gonna go home and make something to eat and asked him if he wanted to come over. I ended up taking her and him home to her place and knew that they probably were gonna hook up, I get a call the next day, her bragging about hooking up with him saying how amazing the night was and how much stuff they have in common. I moved on past this. I told her congratulations and it seems like they were talking and hanging out more often. I will admit this seemed like she was rubbing it in my face. The following month when rent came up again, she ended up telling me she was going to move out and so she wasn‚Äôt going to end up paying me that month rent. I told her that was fine even though I did feel some way about it because she had been in my house for six months without paying any rent, she moved down and we went about our time as friends I got over the initial weirdness and we all became friends. One of the next times we went out I ended up introducing her to a photographer that I had a big crush on. I‚Äôm a very shy girl if I do not tell guys I like them, I don‚Äôt go up to them in a lot of times even if they say they like me, I don‚Äôt believe it. That‚Äôs an insecurity of mine that I have to work on but she knew this is how I felt. I had known him for about two years and he did some photos for a burlesque show I was in. every time he was out and about, and I saw him, I would turn to my best friend and say I have such a big crush on him but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm his type. I had said this more than a few times to her when we ran into him and she knew it. One time I ended up actually introducing them when we saw him and since she is a photographer, I told them initially I think they should work or work together. She was trying to make only fans and she took it as they should work on her only fans together. Within a week she had coffee with him. She had done photos with him and then was cornering me asking if it was OK that they did only fans content together. Again, I‚Äôm not judgmental, but I am not an only fans girl never will be. In sex is just very intimate to me. And even though I am not delusional, I did not think I was going to get with this man. I didn‚Äôt even think he liked me, but I was hurt the fact that she would even ask because she was my friend and I would just hope she knew I was uncomfortable with the whole situation in the end, I told her that they were adults so I was not gonna tell them what to do. Come to find out a few days later that they had already hooked up, had already done content together, and she just didn‚Äôt tell me. Her excuse was she wanted to tell me in person and she just didn‚Äôt know how to explain it to me. But she had no interest in him and didn‚Äôt even find him really attractive. We got an argument because I was hurt that she lied to me. And she ended up texting him and telling him that I had a crush on him. At that point, I was severely embarrassed. He had texted me, and I didn‚Äôt even want to speak to him let alone see him. I wasn‚Äôt mad, but I was embarrassed that I had a crush on him someone, I barely knew. I ended up awkwardly avoiding the whole situation. Every time I saw him or she brought it up. I kinda would not or change the subject, and they continue to work together. And he started to approach her more when we were out and about. I felt like he was acting weird towards me and I told her that even though I said, like I was letting it go. I do remember walking out my house to meet her in my driveway, cat door open, and he was on speakerphone and he said these exact words to her through the phone not knowing I was standing there. ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs so mad. I don‚Äôt wanna have sex with her.‚Äù Months went by and I tried to be a good friend. I tried to be supportive and just brush everything off as if it was all just a miscommunication.  I thought I was just a jealous friend that she was getting attention, but after a few months friends started to come forward and asked me questions. It took a little prying, but I found out that she was telling people things such as I‚Äôm insecure, and how I was trying to steal her men and get with the guys that she gets with. And the security guard in the beginning also told me that my best friend told him I was angry with him that we didn‚Äôt hook up. Which was not true because he tried to hook up with me and I told him no. She then proceeded to tell the security guard that I was sleeping with a mutual friend that she had ended up dating for a few months. This mutual friend flirts with everyone and it was harmless, friendly, flirting I had never hooked up with him. I was truly hurt by all the rumors she was spreading and did not know how to who to believe so I ended the friendship. After two years, we would run into each other randomly and I missed our friendship and didn‚Äôt feel as much anger when I saw her. I ended up, accepting her back into my life as an acquaintance, and we were trying to work up to being friends again. I invited her to my birthday party. She helped take care of me when I was drunk. But something just still didn‚Äôt feel right about the whole situation. She was overcompensating saying that I was her best friend and that she loves me and that we should just be friends again. She also brought up the photographer and said that she is now running a business with him. They are really good friends, and I was the whole reason that they ended up friends and making a business‚Äù this rubbed me the wrong way and I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on why it gets me so angry. After my birthday we were planning to hang out and she messaged me randomly saying she needed to tell me something. She ended up telling me that her and the photographer had been talking the year and a half that me and her weren‚Äôt friends and that they had gotten close and weren‚Äôt telling anybody, but decided to start dating. The first thing I said was congratulations and I was happy you guys found each other, but as I laid in bed, my blood started to boil and I got more and more angry. I did realize that me and the photographer guy probably were never going to work out, not just because I didn‚Äôt think he was into me but because I think we have a different outlook on life and certain things and I just don‚Äôt think we would mesh well together. I have no feelings for him, but it still made me angry. I ended up telling her that I know myself I know my boundaries and I just don‚Äôt wanna put myself in an uncomfortable situation so I will support her from afar. I ended up messaging him as well and congratulating him, but him messaging back, ended up into argument and him saying that I was just jealous that she made the effort to get to know him and that I didn‚Äôt. I want to be her friend, but I just don‚Äôt know how to let go of this anger, and I also feel like I was being manipulated and played in some type of way. I know it could just be my insecurities, but I just want this anger to go away. so am I the asshole?

1jtgh6h,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/the-jinn-haunting-my-marriage-true-horror-story/,The Jinn Haunting My Marriage | A True Horror Story - Paranormaldergi.com,"Salam Alaikum brother, I am ƒ∞brahim from Sakarya. What I am about to tell you are true events that happened to me.

Everything started in 2012 after I decided to marry my wife, Sibel. We married for love and are still madly in love. We also have a sweet four-year-old son. We met in 2009 and decided to marry in 2012. When I told my family, they were very happy about it. A month or two later, we went to Bolu to ask for my wife‚Äôs hand. Thankfully, they gave my wife to me on our first request. After a very lovely evening, we returned home. This is when the events began.

My wife called me the next morning and told me what had happened: After we left, around 3 or 4 AM, someone knocked on her bedroom door, and she heard a voice call ‚ÄúSibel.‚Äù Waking up to the voice, my wife excitedly sat up and said, ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù The door was knocked again, and the same voice called ‚ÄúSibel!‚Äù again. Thinking it was probably her mother, she got up and opened the door, but seeing no one there, she called out to her mother sleeping in the opposite room, ‚ÄúDid you knock on the door?‚Äù When her mother replied, ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt knock, daughter,‚Äù my wife ran to her mother‚Äôs side. She asked me, ‚ÄúWhat do you think this is?‚Äù The only thing that came to my mind was entities from a different dimension. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go into too much detail; there are people jealous of you. Recite prayers every night before sleeping,‚Äù I said. As you can understand, I didn‚Äôt say much to avoid scaring her. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt dwell much on this incident either.

At that time, my wife was studying at university in Sakarya. One day after she finished classes, we met up and went to her student house to eat dinner. After a pleasant conversation, it was time for me to leave. We said goodbye, and I returned home. At three in the morning, my wife called and said, ‚ÄúThe dog is very restless; it‚Äôs staring at the kitchen window and growling, ignoring me. It‚Äôs fixated on that window.‚Äù I had bought her the dog she mentioned so she wouldn‚Äôt feel lonely; it was a fluffy white puppy we named Pamuk. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, darling, I‚Äôm coming right now,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come, I‚Äôll read prayers and sleep,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I can come right away if you want,‚Äù I insisted. Again, she said, ‚ÄúNo dear, don‚Äôt come, I‚Äôm going to sleep,‚Äù and hung up.

I went to work early in the morning. Around noon, I took leave and went to my wife‚Äôs place. She greeted me at the door looking very upset. We sat down, she made me some tea, and we started talking. Sibel said, ‚ÄúAfter hanging up the phone last night, I read prayers and lay down; I fell asleep instantly.‚Äù Fearfully, she took my hand and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know a hoca (religious healer)?‚Äù I was shocked as I didn‚Äôt expect such a question. ‚ÄúHold on, calm down a bit. It seems there‚Äôs something you haven‚Äôt told me. What did you experience last night? Can you tell me about it?‚Äù I asked.

She began to explain: ‚ÄúIn my dream, Pamuk was again fixated on the window, growling, then suddenly hid under the sofa. When I looked at the window, I saw someone in a black shroud entering through the window! I screamed as loud as I could, but nobody heard me. I realized it was a dream when I heard the morning call to prayer, and I got very scared! I want to go home,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOf course, my dear, my love, I‚Äôll take you,‚Äù I replied. I took my wife to my family‚Äôs home. She stayed with us that night. The next morning, I took my wife to her hometown, to her family‚Äôs place. Her family didn‚Äôt know about these incidents yet. After some pleasantries, we had dinner, and I asked for their leave and returned to Sakarya.

During the drive, I thought a lot about whom I could ask for help. On one hand, I wondered if I should tell my family about this, while storms raged in my mind. My wife‚Äôs student house came to mind. I decided to stay there that night. My purpose was to see if I would experience the same things. When such things don‚Äôt happen to a person, they tend to be fearless, but if the girl he loves is involved, he sees nothing else. I stayed there that night, but nothing happened.

The next morning I went to work, and after finishing, I went back to Sibel‚Äôs house. I performed ablution, turned on the computer, and started watching a movie. About five minutes after the evening call to prayer, Pamuk, who was sleeping at my feet, suddenly lifted her head, looked at the kitchen window, and started growling. Stroking her head, I said, ‚ÄúCalm down, girl.‚Äù She seemed hypnotized, not reacting to me. She kept staring at the window and growling. I started to get scared. I had turned off the lights while watching the movie; the room was dark, and nothing was visible. When I turned my head and looked at the window, I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but the moment I looked, my hair stood on end! I picked Pamuk up and asked, ‚ÄúGirl, is someone there?‚Äù The moment I finished my sentence, she started crying! And at that instant, when I saw the dark figure pass by the window, I cursed reflexively. Of course, out of fear, I immediately turned off the computer and took the dog home with me.

When I told my wife about this incident, her fear multiplied. While trying to calm her down, I said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll find a hoca and get rid of this. Until we find one, either you‚Äôll stay at our house, or I‚Äôll stay at yours. I don‚Äôt want to leave you alone in this situation.‚Äù So, I started staying with my wife.

We found a hoca named Mehmet. We learned that he dealt with such matters for the sake of Allah and accepted no money whatsoever. We got his address from my cousin. We got it, but we just couldn‚Äôt manage to go to the hoca. Whenever we intended to go, either one of us would get sick on the planned day, or just as we decided and were about to leave, we‚Äôd forget about the hoca and distract ourselves with outings like crazy. When I noticed this pattern over three months, I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs perform ablution in the morning and set out that way, let‚Äôs see if we can reach the hoca‚Äôs house.‚Äù That morning, we performed our ablutions, recited prayers, and set off. There were no problems. When we arrived at the hoca‚Äôs house, we knocked on the door. A young lady came out. When we said we wanted to see Mehmet Hoca, she replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm his daughter; we lost my father last month.‚Äù We were shocked. ‚ÄúOur condolences,‚Äù we said and turned back. My mind went blank. What were we going to do now?

Okay, I pulled myself together and told my wife, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it; we‚Äôll continue living our lives. I‚Äôll do some research and find a solution. Get these things out of your head; don‚Äôt think about them.‚Äù Nothing happened to us after this incident, and over time, we forgot about what had happened.

On July 14, 2014, my wife and I got married. We were very happy. We went on a honeymoon, had fun, traveled, enjoyed life. Six months into our marriage, I sent my wife to her hometown to spend time with her family. It was the evening of the second day after her departure. As you know, a single man at home, the dishes had piled up. I loaded them into the dishwasher. When I went to the kitchen, I had left my phone on the kitchen table. After finishing my task, when I returned to the table to get my phone, it wasn‚Äôt where I had left it! I searched the house for nearly an hour but couldn‚Äôt find it. Finally, I found it under the pillow in the bedroom! A shiver went down my spine. ‚ÄúHow strange?‚Äù I said to myself. Afterwards, I didn‚Äôt dwell on it much and went to bed. This was the first incident I experienced after getting married.

In the second year of our marriage, the incidents started increasing. Our arguments over trivial matters escalated. It got so intense that some evenings I would leave my wife at home and sleep in the car. We started hurting each other over the smallest things. I kept thinking, ‚ÄúThey are messing with us.‚Äù Knowing this, and since there was nothing I could do, I started trying to win my wife‚Äôs heart every evening. Even when I was right, I would say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wrong,‚Äù and try to appease her. In reality, I was fighting¬†*them*¬†without realizing it.

I sent my wife to her mother‚Äôs for a week. Staying alone and clearing my head would do me good. When night came, I went to my room to sleep. Since the weather was very hot, the balcony door was open. My back was turned to the balcony door. Just as I was about to fall asleep, I started hearing a whistling sound from outside. The whistling sound got progressively closer. I had a premonition that something was about to happen. In shock, I wanted to recite prayers, but they wouldn‚Äôt even come to mind! The curtain suddenly billowed! The room suddenly went cold! Something leaned against my back! May Allah not let anyone experience that moment! Its breath was on my neck; my heartbeat dropped to my toes. Neither the beginning nor the end of the prayers came to my mind. At that moment, my wife came to mind, and an anger strong enough to forget the fear washed over me! I pulled myself together, suddenly cursed, and turned around! I saw the curtain flying outwards. At that moment, as if hypnotized, I fell asleep instantly.

After that night, I started seeing black shadows roaming the house. It had become a habit; I no longer felt scared when I saw them.

One night, my wife and I were in bed. Around 3 or 4 AM, my eyes suddenly opened. I turned to my wife. L√¢ il√¢he illallah! My wife was sitting up, looking at me! I had never seen such large eyes in my life! I bowed my head and told myself, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre imagining things.‚Äù Then I looked again; those eyes were even bigger and looking at me angrily! I bowed my head again, and when I looked again, my wife was asleep! In that momentary fear, perhaps I would have strangled my unsuspecting wife right there! Thanks be to Allah that such a thing didn‚Äôt happen.

One night, I was home alone again. Evening came, and I went to the room to sleep. As I said, I got so used to the shadows that when I entered the room, they would try to flee or hide. I muttered to myself, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother me; I‚Äôm going to sleep.‚Äù Either they were mocking me, or I was mocking them‚Ä¶ All that was left was to be possessed without realizing it. I slept that night.

In my dream, I finally saw the jinn that was bothering me, or rather, the one possessing my wife! I could see its whole body except for its face. Believe me, I don‚Äôt remember what it said then. The event I experienced was this: The jinn was on top of me; it punched me, I punched it. The strange thing was, our punches were moving towards each other slowly, like in slow motion. At that moment, I was both reciting prayers and punching. Thanks be to my Lord, He brought me safely to the morning. When I woke up in the morning, I felt a burning sensation in my left bicep and got up to look in the mirror. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I saw; there was a handprint! But the fingerprints were twice the size of a normal human‚Äôs! I could barely cover a single fingerprint with two of my fingers!

Things were starting to get out of hand. I decided to reveal what I was experiencing to my wife and my own family. First, I told my father. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, don‚Äôt think too much. Recite prayers before sleeping; don‚Äôt go to bed without reciting Ayetel Kursi,‚Äù he said. That‚Äôs all well and good, but I can‚Äôt recite them! When I start a prayer, I fall asleep before finishing it, or when I start reciting, I drift away from the prayer and find myself thinking about other things! I took a picture of the mark on my arm.

My wife‚Äôs family knew a female hoca. They called me to Bolu to meet her. On Saturday, I jumped in my car and went. We met with the female hoca. She was a slightly overweight woman, around 35-40 years old. I told her the events that happened to me, saving the biggest one for last because I was testing the hoca. ‚ÄúI will give you blessed water; Sibel and you should drink this. Then my friends and I will read prayers for you together. You have the evil eye (nazar), nothing else,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOkay then, let me show you something,‚Äù I said. I took out my phone from my pocket, showed the mark on my arm, and asked, ‚ÄúIs this also the evil eye?‚Äù When the woman saw that picture, she reacted in a way I couldn‚Äôt understand, ‚ÄúSend me this picture; I‚Äôll let you know tonight,‚Äù she said. She quickly got up from where we were and walked away. We just stared after her. My wife asked, ‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt told anyone about this incident because I wasn‚Äôt in a state to endure anyone‚Äôs meaningless stares, I said. My wife remained silent without saying anything.

Evening came, the hoca called and said, ‚ÄúMr. ƒ∞brahim, I have a teacher (hoca) in Elazƒ±ƒü. I sent this picture to him too. He will call you in half an hour,‚Äù she said. I thanked her and hung up. A feeling that she would ask for money crept into me. Half an hour later, he called. ‚ÄúMr. ƒ∞brahim, hello, I am Arzu Hoca. I want to get straight to the point without prolonging the matter. What you are experiencing is not good. I saw that picture and want to tell you that you are in real trouble,‚Äù she said. At that moment, an unreasonable anger came over me. Angrily, I asked, ‚ÄúBut Ms. Arzu, what is the situation, and how much will this cost me?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will cost 3800 lira. We need goatskin, special ink, herbs that need to be collected from nature, and many other different materials,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThank you very much, Ms. Arzu, I don‚Äôt need these,‚Äù I said and hung up the phone in her face. When money gets involved in this business, you can‚Äôt trust anyone; these things always seemed very wrong to me.

Ninety percent of the incidents that happened to me occurred when my wife wasn‚Äôt home. My brother-in-law had a close friend named √úmit. ‚ÄúLet me introduce you to him; he‚Äôs not a hoca, but he‚Äôs someone who has seen and experienced things,‚Äù he said. I accepted, and we met. We sat in a cafe, and I showed the mark to √úmit abi (older brother √úmit). ‚ÄúFirst, delete this picture from your phone. I will read prayers for you, and you will get rid of this trouble,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMay Allah bless you, but what is this?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think about such things; don‚Äôt occupy your mind with them. Never mind, I‚Äôll handle it,‚Äù he said. But he couldn‚Äôt resist my insistence and explained a little: ‚ÄúLook brother, this jinn is Christian. There is Hebrew writing on your arm. Don‚Äôt ask what it says; even if you tear yourself apart, I won‚Äôt tell you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAlright, as long as I get rid of it‚Ä¶‚Äù

√úmit abi also repeated what my father said: ‚ÄúYou will recite prayers; you won‚Äôt sleep without reciting. You must always have ablution (wudu). Whether sleeping, walking, whatever you do, you must definitely have ablution,‚Äù he strictly warned. We had ordered our second coffees; they arrived. √úmit abi started talking: ‚ÄúKnowing the unseen (ghayb) belongs only to Allah; no creature can see the future,‚Äù he said and started telling me things about myself. Ninety percent of what he said was correct! Hearing things about me from a man I just met, I said, ‚Äú√úmit Abi, you‚Äôre not ordinary.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen and experienced things too. I have my jinn; I tell what I hear from them. I voice the thoughts in my head,‚Äù he said. I was astonished. The only thing that came to my mind then was to ask, ‚ÄúDo I have jinn too? Can I do such things?‚Äù He laughed heartily and said, ‚ÄúLook ƒ∞brahim, these matters are not that simple. So stay away from this business,‚Äù he said. I had asked once, ‚ÄúJust say yes or no, it‚Äôs that simple,‚Äù I insisted. He began to speak: ‚ÄúLook carefully, brother, you have two jinn with you. One is male, very old, he won‚Äôt harm you, but he protects you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe second is an ifrit, a jinn in love with you. It has even appeared to you once,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere, when?‚Äù I asked. He said there was a water spring on the way to where I lived and, ‚ÄúThe first place it appeared to you was that spring.‚Äù When he said this, I started believing him even more. He continued: ‚ÄúWhile you were filling water from the spring, you passed by it. It looked at you a lot. If you had looked back at it, it would have called you over and extended its hand. Had you gone to it and taken its hand, perhaps you wouldn‚Äôt be here today,‚Äù he said.

My eyes almost popped out looking at √úmit abi. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúAbi, I was eighteen! That spring is on my way home; I always pass by there. There was a blonde girl in a white dress, filling a canister with water from the spring. Yes, she was very beautiful. I reluctantly glanced and immediately lowered my head so the girl wouldn‚Äôt misunderstand me. I walked past her,‚Äù I said. √úmit abi understood the situation and warmed up. ‚ÄúI have a teacher (hoca); shall we go to him?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I agreed. He called, found out he was available and waiting for us. We jumped in the car and went to the hoca‚Äôs place.

After the welcome greetings, he sat me on a divan and stood opposite me. ‚ÄúRelax, don‚Äôt be afraid at all,‚Äù he said. He explained step by step what would happen and said a jinn would enter me. When I asked, ‚ÄúHow will it enter?‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk!‚Äù I kept quiet. I don‚Äôt know if it entered me or not, but I felt like I was levitating from the couch I was sitting on. I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes out of fear. After about five minutes, I felt something boiling inside me, and the hoca was continuously reciting, whispering to himself. Finally, he said, ‚ÄúThere, it‚Äôs over, you can get up.‚Äù Believe me, nothing was wrong with me anymore; I felt completely filled with peace. My joy, strength, and mood returned. ‚ÄúMay Allah bless you, hocam. What was wrong with me?‚Äù I asked curiously. He laughed and said, ‚Äú√úmit abi explained it to you; the rest is our business. We‚Äôve handled it with Allah‚Äôs permission,‚Äù he said.

I was very comfortable for about six months. One night around 11 PM, the door knocked at home. I got up, opened the door, nobody was there. ‚ÄúDamn neighborhood kids are acting up again,‚Äù I muttered to myself. As I was changing to go out, I felt a shiver. I didn‚Äôt pay much attention. Just as I closed the door and put on my shoes, the door knocked again! But this time, it knocked from inside the house! Fearfully, I grabbed the doorknob and pulled it towards me so it wouldn‚Äôt open. The door suddenly started shaking! Whatever was behind it started hitting the door much harder, as if trying to break it! At that moment, I started reciting the Euzu Besmele and reading prayers. When the shaking stopped, I quickly left the house and called √úmit abi. When I told him, ‚ÄúAbi, this and that happened,‚Äù he asked, ‚ÄúDid you recite?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúDid the sounds stop then?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúRecite Ayetel Kursi over it 7 times and open the door, but don‚Äôt go inside. Recite inside, then enter. Then recite in the living room, then the bedroom, then the children‚Äôs room, then the kitchen. Don‚Äôt be afraid if you start hearing sounds,‚Äù he advised. I did everything he said, one by one. Thanks be to Allah, I didn‚Äôt hear any sounds. I immediately went to bed and slept.

The next evening, I fell asleep watching television. In my dream, I was running from them. Just as they were about to catch me, I woke up‚Ä¶ I realized I had fallen asleep at that moment. When I turned my head to the right from where I lay, I saw a black entity looking at me! Just as I was about to get up, it swiftly came next to me and kicked me hard in the side! The pain fully opened my eyes. I realized I was dreaming within a dream. I got up and ate something in the kitchen. Then, while clearing away what I ate, a small shadow passed by the kitchen doorway. Since I was used to them, a smile mixed with fear formed on my face. Ten seconds later, another shadow, about two meters tall, passed by. This one seemed in no hurry; I saw it slowly pass the doorway and enter the bathroom. I quickly followed and opened the bathroom door. As soon as I opened it, the door slammed shut in my face! Leaving the lights on, I only took the house keys and went to my parents‚Äô house. When my mother saw me, she asked, ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing, I was alone at home, got bored, wanted to come stay here,‚Äù I said. Thankfully, my mother prepared a bed, and I spent the night there.

I have a friend named Cemal at work. During the morning tea break, he came up to me and started, ‚Äúƒ∞brahim, I‚Äôve been meaning to ask you‚Ä¶‚Äù Before he could finish, I said, ‚ÄúAsk, brother, go ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you very thoughtful lately. You don‚Äôt join us either. Is something wrong?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThere is, brother, and very big problems too. I can‚Äôt cope anymore; I don‚Äôt know what will happen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTell me, brother, maybe I can help,‚Äù he offered. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs sit somewhere after work and talk,‚Äù I suggested.

In the evening, Cemal and I sat somewhere, and I told him everything that had happened, one by one. ‚ÄúAhmet brother, why didn‚Äôt you tell me sooner? I know a hoca,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCemal, he doesn‚Äôt ask for money, right, brother?‚Äù I asked. He laughed. ‚ÄúNo, brother. Let me call him; if he‚Äôs available tomorrow, we‚Äôll meet at the shopping mall and go see him,‚Äù he said. Cemal and I parted ways and went home.

Around 8 PM, while watching television, the electricity suddenly went out. I couldn‚Äôt move from my spot; fear gripped me. Everywhere was dark; only the lights from passing cars occasionally illuminated the room. I felt someone was at the living room door, but I couldn‚Äôt look out of fear. Finally, I gathered my courage and looked‚Ä¶ Oh my God! What was that! In the top left corner of the door, I locked eyes with an entity whose eyes glowed like fire and whose skin seemed to be peeling off! I immediately turned my head towards the window, starting to watch the people and cars passing by. I wondered if I screamed at the top of my lungs, would someone come to my rescue? When I looked at the door again, the eyes had grown even larger! I saw something black dripping from its mouth! I turned my head back to the window again. ‚ÄúOh God, I‚Äôm going to die this time,‚Äù I thought. My heartbeat was so strong it felt like it was shaking me where I sat. My psychology was in turmoil. My fear turned into anger this time. Again, I gathered myself, suddenly turned my head towards it, and looked, but I couldn‚Äôt see it there! I slept on the couch that night.

In the morning, I met Cemal during the ten o‚Äôclock tea break and told him about the incident from last night. Cemal looked uneasy. He sighed and began to speak: ‚ÄúLook brother, yesterday I called the hoca and explained the situation. However, they must not have liked it because yours came to me last night,‚Äù he said. I was surprised. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúMy wife and I were asleep last night. At one point, I saw my blanket lift. When I saw a woman crawling towards under my arm, I quickly pulled my arm into the blanket and started reciting prayers. She kept shouting at me, ‚ÄòYou weren‚Äôt supposed to help him! You weren‚Äôt supposed to help him!‚Äô It was a dream‚Ä¶ My wife woke me up, asking, ‚ÄòWhat happened? Why are you reciting the adhan?'‚Äù

After work, we went to the hoca‚Äôs place. The hoca‚Äôs name was ƒ∞smail. ƒ∞smail hoca met us at the door. He was around 50-55 years old, with white hair, no beard. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWhat kind of hoca is this?‚Äù I was surprised. Cemal addressed ƒ∞smail hoca as ‚Äúamca‚Äù (uncle). I started calling him ‚Äúamca‚Äù too. ‚ÄúTell me, nephew, what did you experience, what happened?‚Äù he asked. I told him everything that had happened, step by step. When I finally said, ‚ÄúAmca, I‚Äôve started having thoughts of killing myself‚Ä¶‚Äù ƒ∞smail amca replied, ‚ÄúI know, nephew, they play with you like a small child, then get into your head and drive you to suicide. We‚Äôll handle it,‚Äù he said. He called to his wife, ‚ÄúDear, pour us some tea,‚Äù and asked if we were hungry. We said we weren‚Äôt. I felt very safe with the uncle. He noticed this too and smiled at me. Confidently, he said, ‚ÄúOkay nephew, consider this done.‚Äù

We sipped our teas. After the evening call to prayer, he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin.‚Äù Closing his eyes and reciting a few prayers, he began talking to himself. I‚Äôm telling you what I heard with my own ears: ‚Äúƒ∞brahim‚Ä¶ Yes‚Ä¶ Yes‚Ä¶ Okay‚Ä¶ Go look‚Ä¶ Handle it‚Ä¶‚Äù he said. He opened his eyes and smiled at me. For five minutes, the uncle said nothing. He closed his eyes again. One thing that caught my attention was this: Every time the uncle closed his eyes, his face turned bright red. Normally, if I had experienced such an event with another hoca, it would have seemed very absurd to me; I would have thought, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs definitely lying, he‚Äôs definitely going to tell tall tales,‚Äô but because this was unlike the other hocas, I felt genuinely very comfortable inside. I didn‚Äôt judge him at all. After a certain period, the uncle opened his eyes and looked at me: ‚ÄúNephew, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. The jinn possessing your wife tried to break you up after you got married. Because you love your wife and because you backed down in most of your arguments, meaning you continuously won your wife‚Äôs heart, they focused on you. With Allah‚Äôs permission, both you and your wife will find relief after tonight. Let your wife come home now,‚Äù he said. I had told the uncle my wife wasn‚Äôt home. I looked at him, smiled, and said, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù The uncle said, ‚ÄúAfter your wife arrives, I will come to your house and read prayers for both your wife and the house.‚Äù

I left there very happy. May Allah be pleased with the uncle. For a month, he called every day asking, ‚ÄúIs there any trouble?‚Äù He came to the house, read prayers for my wife and the house. I haven‚Äôt experienced any incidents for three years. May Allah bless the uncle and his helpers a thousand times over. People should be careful; there are people out there claiming to be ‚Äòhocas‚Äô and taking advantage of people‚Äôs vulnerabilities; don‚Äôt fall into their traps.",1,1744014947.0,ParanormalHorror,0,1.0,False

I run a coffee shop as a limited company and I'm the sole owner. I have a buyer lined up who wants to take over the premises and keep it going as is. 

There's only one share in the company valued at ¬£1 on Companies House.
I took a personal loan to start the business but have been paying it back from the company's bank account. I'm happy to transfer this debt onto myself personally.

I'm willing to let the new owners run the shop with it's current name but they're not interested in buying the limited company. I'm happy to sign a goodwill 'contract' and they can keep all the assets and stock. They will also sign a new lease and I will surrender my existing one.

My question is how do I go about all this to make sure that I'm no longer liable for anything to do with the business and the premises?

We've agreed a price and I need to know what kind of contracts/documents I need to draw up so it's all legally binding and I'll be free of any responsibilities.

Hope this all makes sense.
Any advice will be much appreciated. Thank you

1jtgbxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jtgbxy/what_tea_is_best_for_a_flat_tummy/,What tea is best for a flat tummy?,"After years of trying different teas, supplements, and gut health ‚Äútricks,‚Äù I finally decided to give **Lulutox Detox Tea** a try. It‚Äôs been all over my TikTok and Instagram feed‚Äîtons of people talking about how it helps with bloating, stubborn weight, and fatigue.

Naturally, I was skeptical.

But after using **lulutox tea** for six weeks straight, I‚Äôm actually pretty impressed. I wanted to share an **unfiltered, detailed review** of how it worked (or didn‚Äôt) for me‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre looking for a natural way to feel lighter, improve digestion, and maybe drop a few pounds.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Why I was curious about Lulutox Detox Tea**

I‚Äôve had on-and-off issues with bloating and just feeling *heavy*, especially around my midsection. I exercise, eat decently, but I always felt like my metabolism was lagging. When I searched **what tea is best for a flat tummy**, **lulutox detox tea** kept popping up.

People said it helped them feel lighter, reduced cravings, and made their clothes fit better. Sounded like exactly what I needed‚Äîbut I wanted to see for myself.

**What‚Äôs actually in Lulutox Tea?**

The first thing I did before buying was check out the **lulutox tea ingredients**. It‚Äôs a 13-superfood blend, all natural, and some of the herbs were ones I already knew were legit:

* **Matcha Green Tea** ‚Äì for metabolism support
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** ‚Äì for energy without the crash
* **Sencha & Oolong Tea** ‚Äì full of antioxidants
* **Milk Thistle & Dandelion Leaf** ‚Äì believed to support detox & digestion
* **Ginseng** ‚Äì known to help reduce stress and fatigue
* **Lemongrass, Goji Berries, Nettle Leaf** ‚Äì more anti-inflammatory and gut-soothing herbs
* **Stevia Leaf** ‚Äì natural sweetener, no added sugar

The formula is also **vegan, soy-free, gluten-free**, and has **around 18mg of caffeine per bag** (which is a lot less than coffee but still gives a nice lift).

**My 6-week experience with Lulutox Detox Tea**

**Week 1‚Äì2:**  
The first real change I noticed was less bloating‚Äîespecially at night. Normally, I have to unbutton my pants by 6 PM (TMI, but true). After about 4‚Äì5 days of sipping one cup a day, I felt more comfortable and less puffy overall.

**Week 3‚Äì4:**  
More energy. I was still drinking coffee, but I didn‚Äôt feel as dependent on it. My brain fog lifted a bit, and I stopped crashing around 3 PM like I usually do. I also started waking up feeling less groggy.

**Week 5‚Äì6:**  
I dropped about 5 lbs without changing much else. I was walking daily and eating fairly clean, but I wasn‚Äôt tracking macros or anything extreme. I think what helped most was that I wasn‚Äôt craving snacks constantly. The tea helped me feel more satisfied throughout the day.

**Any lulutox detox tea side effects?**

This was a big concern of mine going in. I‚Äôve had terrible experiences with detox teas in the past‚Äîones that send you running to the bathroom or give you cramps.

**Lulutox tea did not do that.** It was very gentle. No stomach aches, no weird urgency, and no disruption to my daily routine. The only thing I noticed was that I needed to stay hydrated‚Äîit‚Äôs a tea, after all, and if you‚Äôre not drinking enough water, you might feel a bit dry.

If you're wondering **is lulutox tea safe**, I‚Äôd say yes for most people, but it‚Äôs always smart to check with your doctor, especially if you‚Äôre on medication.

**Where to buy it (and avoid fakes)**

There are a lot of knockoffs out there pretending to be the real deal. I ordered mine from the [**official Lulutox site here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST), where they had a 70% off sale running. It shipped quickly and came with a little guide on how to get the best results.

I also found this [**second link with the same discount**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) saved in my browser‚Äîso either one should work.

**Final Thoughts ‚Äì Does Lulutox Detox Tea actually work?**

If you‚Äôre asking, **lulutox detox tea does it work?**‚Äîfor me, it helped with exactly what I was hoping for:

* Less bloating
* More energy
* Gentle digestion support
* Some weight loss without effort

I wouldn‚Äôt call it a magic fix. But paired with light activity and good habits, it definitely gave me the edge I needed to feel better in my own body.

Would love to hear if anyone else here has tried it. What was your **lulutox tea review** like? Did it help with your energy or tummy issues? And did anyone experience different **lulutox detox tea side effects** than I did?

1jtgadu,https://www.reddit.com/r/everestthreepasstrek/comments/1jtgadu/accommodation_options_during_the_everest_three/,Accommodation Options During the Everest Three Pass Trek with Himalayan Asia Treks,"The Everest Three Passes Trek is a challenging yet rewarding adventure that takes trekkers through some of the most rugged and scenic landscapes in the Everest region of Nepal. With its diverse routes, stunning views of towering peaks, and high-altitude terrain, this trek offers an unforgettable experience for seasoned trekkers. However, one of the key considerations when embarking on such an adventure is accommodation. Knowing where to stay during the trek can greatly enhance the trekking experience, ensuring comfort, safety, and an opportunity to rest and acclimatize.

# Types of Accommodation on the Everest Three Pass Trek

The accommodation options available on the Everest Three Pass Trek are primarily teahouses, which are small guesthouses offering basic amenities to trekkers. These teahouses are situated along the trekking route, providing a place to rest, enjoy a hot meal, and spend the night. The quality and comfort of these accommodations can vary depending on the location and altitude, but they all serve a similar purpose‚Äîproviding a safe and cozy shelter for trekkers.

# 1. Teahouses (Guesthouses)

Teahouses are the most common type of accommodation on the Everest Three Pass Trek. These family-run lodges offer trekkers a simple but comfortable place to stay. The rooms are typically small, with basic wooden furnishings, a bed, and sometimes a small table. In most cases, rooms are shared, though some teahouses offer private rooms for a higher price.

**Facilities in Teahouses:**

* **Bedrooms:** The rooms are generally basic, with a bed (usually with a mattress, pillow, and blanket), but don't expect luxurious linens or high-end furniture. The temperature can drop significantly at higher altitudes, so most rooms will have a thick blanket to keep you warm.
* **Common Areas:** Teahouses often have a communal dining area where trekkers can relax, socialize, and enjoy meals. In the evenings, trekkers gather here to drink hot beverages like tea, coffee, or hot chocolate, which helps warm the body in the cold mountain environment.
* **Bathrooms:** Many teahouses provide basic outdoor toilets, though the facilities can be quite rudimentary. Some teahouses along the trek might have shared indoor toilets, but don‚Äôt expect flush toilets at higher altitudes.
* **Charging and Wi-Fi:** In some places, you may find solar-powered electricity, allowing you to charge your devices, though this service often comes with a small fee. Wi-Fi is available in some areas, but its reliability and speed can be very limited due to the remote location.

**Examples of Popular Teahouses along the Everest Three Pass Trek:**

* **Lukla:** The starting point of the trek, Lukla, has a variety of teahouses, from simple accommodations to more comfortable options. These teahouses are often equipped with modern amenities like Wi-Fi, though services may be slow.
* **Namche Bazaar:** As the gateway to the Everest region, Namche Bazaar offers a wider range of accommodation options, including teahouses with heated rooms, private bathrooms, and more extensive menus. It is the perfect place for trekkers to acclimatize before heading to higher altitudes.
* **Dingboche:** At a higher altitude, Dingboche offers teahouses with cozy rooms, hearty meals, and beautiful views of surrounding peaks. This village is a popular stop for trekkers crossing the Three Passes, as it is located at a strategic elevation for acclimatization.

# 2. Mountain Lodges

As the trek ascends into the higher altitudes, the availability of teahouses decreases, and the accommodations become more basic. In some areas, trekkers will stay in mountain lodges, which are even more basic than teahouses but still provide essential services such as food, shelter, and warmth.

**Facilities in Mountain Lodges:**

* **Shared Rooms:** Rooms in mountain lodges tend to be simple with fewer amenities than those at lower altitudes. They are designed to offer a place to sleep and recover, but they may not always have beds or blankets as comfortable as those found at teahouses.
* **Shared Facilities:** The shared facilities in mountain lodges include common rooms for meals and socializing. Often, the lodge will have one or two stoves to provide warmth during the cold nights.
* **Basic Toilets:** At higher altitudes, toilets may be very basic, often just a squat toilet, with minimal running water available.

# 3. Camping

While teahouses are the most common form of accommodation on the Everest Three Pass Trek, some trekkers may choose to camp in specific areas for a more immersive experience in nature. Himalayan Asia Treks offers the option of camping in the more remote sections of the trek, where teahouses are not available. This option is ideal for those who want a more intimate experience with the Himalayas, away from the hustle and bustle of the lodges.

**Camping Essentials:**

* **Tent Setup:** Camping in the Everest region requires a team of porters and guides who will carry the camping equipment. The tents are usually high-quality, four-season tents designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the mountains.
* **Sleeping Bags and Mats:** High-quality sleeping bags designed for sub-zero temperatures will be provided, ensuring trekkers stay warm in the frigid mountain air. Sleeping mats are also included for additional comfort.
* **Meals:** During camping, trekkers are provided with delicious and nutritious meals prepared by professional cooks. Meals typically include dal bhat (lentil soup), rice, vegetables, and high-energy snacks to keep you fueled for the trek.

Camping provides the opportunity to stay in isolated, serene locations, where you can wake up to the breathtaking beauty of the Himalayan landscape without the noise or crowds of nearby teahouses.

# Best Areas to Stay During the Everest Three Pass Trek

1jtga8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1jtga8t/does_determinism_mean_there_was_a_plan_or/,Does determinism mean there was a plan or scenario that gets implemented as the world unfolds?,"Suppose that determinism is true. The question of the cause of the first event (the big bang) and whether it was determined is a difficult one. Still, we may safely assume that all events after the big bang were determined.

Let‚Äôs take a simple choice: yesterday morning after thinking what to have, tea or coffee, I chose tea. Was it true after the big bang that I would drink tea yesterday? It seems so. When the big bang just happened it was true that billions of years later I (exactly as I was yesterday) would do exactly what I did. But what made it true before it actually happened?

Maybe this big bang event made it true? But what does the big bang have to do with my drinking tea? It‚Äôs strange to say that the big bang was the direct cause of my choice, since there was a temporal distance of billions of years and plenty of other events in-between. Nor can we say that the big bang somehow ‚Äòcontained‚Äô a future event of my drinking tea, because this event wasn‚Äôt there yet. Nothing remotely like my drinking tea could be found in the big bang event. Also, the big bang, unlike me, was not an agent who can think, plan and decide things.

Why then was it true so long ago that this event would take place? We can imagine a lot of things that could have happened instead. I could have chosen coffee, or maybe juice or water. With a different history, I could have been a different person, facing another choice. If human beings evolved differently, there could have been some other creature at this place yesterday. After all, our world could have come to an end before yesterday, so nothing would have taken place here. There are endless possibilities, logically consistent, that are open to an imaginative mind. But all of them except for one would have never been realized. After the big bang happened, something ensures and guarantees that only one event would necessarily happen here yesterday morning.

So, if the big bang wasn‚Äôt the direct cause of my drinking tea, yet the fact that this event would happen exactly as it did was true right after the big bang, I must conclude that there was a plan or scenario, of which this event was a tiny part. Otherwise I can‚Äôt explain why the future occurrence of such a detailed event was true before it actually happened.

That would be quite a ‚Äòghostly‚Äô plan, because our weakest imaginations, thoughts and dreams would be more substantive, more qualitative compared to it. However, every event would take place in strict accordance to the plan. When in our ordinary life people arrange a meeting for tomorrow, they assume that something can go wrong, it could be delayed or cancelled. With realizing this predetermined plan, there are no alterations, delays or cancellations.

This plan would be comprehensive, including every action, thought and feeling anyone would ever do or have. It would not be a rough sketch with details to be added in progress. Nor would it contain ‚Äòcrossroads‚Äô like in a computer game where a player can choose one path leading to one future and a different path leading to another.

So, if this is right, we can say that our world evolves in accordance with a previously existed scenario, like a movie that goes in the only one predetermined way.

Determinists, do you think there was a plan that gets implemented? If not, what explains the truth of the any future event (in its total description) long before it happened?

There is also a question of deservedness. For example, an actor in the theater could play good and passionate and therefore be praised for their skill and efforts. Or they can act lazily and unconvincingly and be blamed for doing a bad job. But if there has been a complete scenario that plays out infallibly, then everything an actor does is a part of implementation of this scenario. How can one put more (or less) effort, if the exact amount of effort is already there in the scenario, and it will be implemented just as it was written? What exactly is one praised or blamed for?",1,1744014045.0,freewill,4,0.67,False

1jtg8d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jtg8d7/i_gave_my_first_ever_promotion_and_the_reaction/,I gave my first ever promotion and the reaction caught me off guard completely,"Not an English speaker.

So since a month i changed country due to my job promotion for a big role and since i'm in a higher role i have the chance to give promotions and all this stuff and this morning what i wrote in the title happened.

So i was reviewing clients contracts, companies expenses and all this stuff when 2 documents caught my attention because they were having the same name at the bottom. I checked others and at the end i saw that the same name was on a lot of documents so i made a small research on who was the guy. It turned out the guy was almost on the top list of people with more overtime. So it was easy to understand, he was taking responsabilities and risks above his role, hard worker and was doing a ton of overtime.

So i just leaned back looking at his name and he reminded of me. Hard worker, crazy overtime hours(even if my overtime wasn't paid), taking risky choices and so i decided to award him with a promotion. (Actually i didn't understood why he wasn't having any promotion but he was always at the same role and salary despite all this things) 

So i called him in my office to deliver the news and when he arrived and took a seat i noticed he was sweating and was shaking so i told him to take a glass of water amd reassured him that i wasn't about to fire him and he seemed relief but when i opened my mouth to talk again he caught me off guard ""boss did i do something wrong? I made some mistakes? Am i in trouble?"". I just smiled and told him no and then told him that i appreciated a lot his dedication and hard work for this company so i was giving him a promotion and a salary raise.(from around 30k a year to around 50k)

He again caught me off guard when i finished and started crying. Not a few tears but was actually seriously crying. It went for a few minutes until he asked me ""boss can i have a hug?"". I was stunned but replied ""ehm....ok i guess..."" and he actually huged me ahahah. But then explained why. According to him 2 days ago he was talking with his gf about saving money for their future, their future house, a wedding and their new life so this promotion was coming at the perfect timing and out of the blue asked me if i was some kind of friend of his gf because it was a weird coincidence that 2 days ago they were talking about this and today he got his first promotion but again i smiled and joked ""well it depends, if your gf is cute i can surely become her friend hahahah"".

So we talked a bit and he again thanked me. I thought that it was the end of this but then when we had the morning break and i was down to take a coffee with some collegues we noticed that he stepped aside and made a call. When he delivered the news we heard someone screaming at the phone ""seriously? Tell me you're not joking, i'm so proud of you ...."" We all exchanged a look like ""ok, wtf is going on?"" and then he confirmed that he called his gf and as we heard she was ""a bit happy of the news"" ahahah. (Of course bro, just a bit happy ahahah)

So just this. I really thought that he would just be happy about the promotion but it turned out to be very important for him and i'm just happy to valorize his hard work and dedication for our company. And until now is one of those shitty days and i'm already angry as hell and hope this day to end as quickly as possible but this guy's reaction just make happy and smiling.",7,1744013807.0,stories,1,0.89,False
1jtg84d,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1jtg84d/why_i_think_espresso_macchiato_from_tommy_cash_is/,Why I think Espresso Macchiato from Tommy Cash is brilliant,"""Espresso macchiato, por favore!""‚Äîwhile not perfectly grammatical in Spanish or Italian, it‚Äôs a phrase you‚Äôll likely hear in coffee shops worldwide.

According to the BBC, Brazil, Vietnam, and Colombia are the top 3 producers of coffee beans, while the U.S., Germany, and France lead as the biggest importers. Yet, despite its global journey, coffee culture still carries an Italian heartbeat due to the improvement of the espresso machine by Luigi Bezzera. From espresso to cappuccino, the names (and the rituals) stick. It is kinda funny that regardless of your language we use this terms. 

And TBH, millennials have turned coffee into more than just a drink; it‚Äôs a lifestyle, fueled by chains like Starbucks and the eternal hustle. For many, grabbing a coffee isn‚Äôt just about caffeine, it‚Äôs a status symbol or at least that is what big chains want us to believe. ""No time to talk, scusi, my days are very busy!"" **The overall song, in its simplicity, feels like a metaphor for modern life: globalization, strong, quick, and the money hustle.**


Tommy Cash knows how to blend art with irony, for what I have seen quickly in his work. Whether referencing Mona Lisa or nodding to Andy Warhol in his videos, he wraps Italian clich√©s and everyday chaos into swingy, danceable beats with lyrics that stick in your head (I have a few thoughts about the music)

And let‚Äôs not forget the look‚Äî Dressed like a cartoon businessman straight out of a satirical comic: crisp white shirt, bold blue suit, and that pencil-red tie. Adding to all that, a playful yet pointed nod to the globalized stereotype of the Italian-American guy we‚Äôve seen in films, ads, and pop culture for decades.

Reading this sub has us excited but a bit overwhelmed with the choices. We want a hotel with western beds that is on the beach, preferably in a quieter area but still with a couple bars/coffee shops/restaurants that are walkable. We will want to scuba diver 2-3 days (have advanced certs), golf 0-2 times (high handicappers who prefer more relaxed courses), and mostly just relaxing in a shaded cabana on the ocean. 

We won‚Äôt have a car so the main island/naha seems less ideal reading posts here and will prefer to stay in one place vs island hop. Tokashiki doesn‚Äôt appear to have golf. Ishigaki seems to hit all the marks (flying out on Jin air) with an option like ANA InterContinental Ishigaki Resort but they only have a 10-hole course on site.
