1pede5x,https://i.redd.it/epk5tms2g95g1.jpeg,🔥 For Serious Espresso Lovers: Anyone Tried Spring-Loaded Tampers Like the Normcore V4? ☕💪,"If you're from Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, or the US, you probably take your coffee as seriously as I do.
And lately, I’ve been experimenting with tools that make espresso shots more consistent — especially tampers.

Recently, I came across the Normcore V4 Spring-Loaded Tamper (53.3mm) and was really impressed by the design:

☕ What makes it interesting:

Spring-loaded pressure with options for 15 lb / 25 lb / 30 lb, which keeps the tamp perfectly even.

Flat base for better puck density.

Anodized aluminum handle & stand—solid build and premium feel.

Helps reduce channeling and makes shots more consistent, even if you’re not a professional barista.

I know many of you brew multiple espresso shots a day, especially in the Nordic countries and North America…
So I’m curious:

👉 Have any of you tried the Normcore V4 or other spring-loaded tampers?

Does it actually improve your extraction?

Is the pressure consistency worth the upgrade?

Any alternatives you recommend?

I’d love to hear your experiences, especially from heavy espresso drinkers.
Your feedback might help me (and others) decide whether this should become part of our daily coffee workflow.

Full disclosure I really dislike coffee in cocktails in general. It always makes me want to just drink normal coffee.  The revolver was no exception. I liked the earthy bitterness and I caught all the flavors elements of this drink. Personally the flamed orange was my favorite part. That reminded me of a chocolate orange. Overall not my favorite drink but I’m glad I tried it. 

Malort continues to surprise me each day. Today the Malort enhanced the earthy, grassy qualities of the coffee, but retained its alpine notes as well. In addition it gave me that “wonderful” gasoline note that sometimes is used to describe it. I actually think I may have enjoyed the Revolver more if it had the Malort I. It. Is this Stockholm syndrome? Who knows. 8/10 for the Malort chaser.

In case you're wondering, I am in fact embarrassed to post here again. Is there a record for most attempts on a single query? Anyway, here we go again. I listened to the advice from last time and included more info on Rowan's motivations and Adria's background. I'm hoping I evened the playing field for both characters and made each POV feel necessary and interesting. Thanks!

Dear Agent,



I am seeking representation for HOW YOU HEAR ME, my 93k word romance novel with a speculative twist. For fans of Ashley Poston’s *Sounds Like Love*, with the sweet college romance of Christina Lauren’s *Tangled Up in You*, HOW YOU HEAR ME is a slow-burn love story written in dual POV with a dose of millennial nostalgia. 



Adria Holzen can’t let go of her dream of being a teacher. Even though last semester’s mental health crisis sent her grades close to failing, working with kids has always been the one thing she’s been good at. But earning acceptance into her university’s student teaching program means Adria has to collaborate with her fellow classmates— the very ones who’ve seen her at her worst. 



Rowan Briggs has been able to hear people’s thoughts since he was young, a secret he’s mostly kept to himself. Growing up, he watched his mother use her ability as a weapon. But now that he’s in college and moving out from underneath her shadow, he’s deciding how much of his gift is truly good. If Rowan makes it as a teacher, maybe he can become the person he always wished was there for him.



When Adria and Rowan are assigned to work together on a semester-long project, neither one of them are thrilled. But Rowan’s stoic facade crumbles after he’s able to deescalate her panic at the first presentation. To Adria, he is quiet and observant–able to sense her anxiety when she’s sure she’s kept it hidden. Unbeknownst to her, he’s hearing everything– her worries, her intentions, and the palpable attraction that he too is feeling as they spend hours researching. After she witnesses Rowan interceding for a stranger in trouble, Adria begins to put together all the strange things she’s noticed about him. But with the semester coming to an end and the academic pressure mounting, knowing the truth about each other may be more than either has been expecting. 



Like my protagonist, I attended university to become a teacher. I received a bachelor’s in English/Language Arts from \[university\]. Today I live in \[location\] with my husband and our four children. When I’m not writing, I enjoy reading, baking, and drinking far too much iced coffee. Thank you for your time and consideration.

And it was great in our early 20s. But over the past year I’ve been trying to grow a bit. New hobbies, better habits, actually sleeping, that kind of thing. Recently she’s started making little comments like, “Oh look who’s too busy for the old crew,” or “You changed,” but not in a supportive, proud way more like I betrayed her by becoming a slightly more stable human. It really hit me last weekend. We were talking about maybe taking a short trip, and halfway through the conversation I mentioned I have some money saved up for it. She immediately made a face and said, “Must be nice,” in that tone that doesn’t sound joking at all. Then she got weirdly cold the rest of the night.   
I don’t think I’m better than her or anything like that. I’ve just been trying to get my life together a little, and it feels like she’s taking it personally like my progress is a reminder that she’s stuck. And now I feel guilty for changing, which is wild because isn’t that the whole point of growing up?

Idk. It feels like she wants me to stay exactly who I used to be so she doesn’t have to look at her own stuff. Hot take or not, I’m tired of shrinking myself just to keep the peace.",28,1764885371.0,TwoHotTakes,7,0.95,False

1ped375,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ped375/update_i_keep_meeting_my_birth_mom_but_she_doesnt/,Update I keep meeting my birth mom but she doesn’t know it’s me,"Well… I did it I told her. And yeah it was pretty heavy. My heart was even beating fast. i kept trying to think how to tell her. Many of the comments on my last post here mentioned writing her a letter just how she wrote a letter for me. Originally that was the plan but for me it felt like I needed to say it.

Oh, really quick I wanna say thanks to everyone for their love and support. Mostly to all the birth parents out there who shared their stories with me. That’s what really helped push me to have the courage to confront her. It meant so much so thanks.

Everything happened day before yesterday btw.

I did wait for her to be done with her shift and that was when they were closing the restaurant already. And waited in the parking lot. We said hi when she saw me first but then I told her there was something serious that she needed to know. First told her sorry for keeping it from her this long. She didn’t react until I actually pulled out her letter.

And she started bawling from there. Like screaming and crying at the same time, and didn’t even have to finish the whole “I’m your son” speech. She just saw it and knew. It was crazy. Next thing I know she’s hugging me instantly but then she pulled back and asked if it’s okay to hug me. Ofc it is and we’re just there hugging an crying in the parking lot. It hit her hard though. Her legs gave out for a second so I had to actually hold her up while she’s still hugging me for a min.

What really got me was her saying to me look how big you got. also hearing her cry made me cry too. She went back to open the restaurant up (she wouldn’t take no for an answer) we had coffee, ate a slice of their pie inside and talked. Soooo many stuff we talked about. She told me the second time I came to the restaurant she got a feeling but for her it was hard believe it was me. So that feeling she had was pushed way down.

Because she told me for years after I was adopted she saw kids that would be my age and used to think they were me. Then she would be crying in public. It fucked with her mind a lot and made her depressed so she didn’t want to do the same when she saw me, getting her hopes up like that.

She says I look so much like my biological dad when he was younger though. We talked about him too. They stayed in contact with eachother incase I ever reached out to one of them so it would be easier to contact the other. I didn’t have hope about finding my biological dad since he was never mentioned so I’m glad they both planned for this future scenario. She told me about how they wanted to keep me. Especially my biological dad, he didn’t want me to be adopted. But he knew they had to because they were just kids. It took him a long time to get passed it after I was born she told me. That’s why he didn’t leave anything because he didn’t wanna believe he might not see me again.

We talked for hours. Til almost 2 in the morning (they closed at 11). She just wanted to know everything about me but her main thing was “am I happy”. Were my parents good to me. Did I have a happy childhood. And I did. I told her thank you for helping to give me this life. We both cried again. She cried the most. Everything was very emotional for her. Sometimes she would look really happy but then get sad again.

After my 18th birthday she was hoping I would find her that’s why she stayed in the same city. But since I didn’t she always thought maybe I resented her, wasn’t told I’m adopted, or maybe had decided it was better not to have her around. It made me feel bad for not telling her sooner. She told me it’s not my fault and I did right going at my own pace. Honestly she’s so sweet. The way she kept looking at me with the biggest smile, it made me emotional sometimes. Makes you think how can someone who’s been a total stranger ur whole life look at you with so much love. It’s wild. We learned so much about eachother. She asked me if we could have dinner soon to keep talking. And if at some point in the future if I’m interested come over to her house so I can meet her husband. That all sounded really great.

We exchanged numbers. After I left she sent a text telling me thank you for giving her this gift that she didn’t know if it would ever come.

My girlfriend came over and she hugged me while I cried. I wasn’t sad btw these were happy tears. Everything went better than I expected. There was still emotionally heavy stuff but I’m still glad that we got to open up to eachother.",2,1764885328.0,offmychest,2,0.75,False

1ped1iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/apps/comments/1ped1iz/i_created_a_ios_sudoku_app_without_knowing_how_to/,I created a iOS Sudoku app without knowing how to play Sudoku,"Hey everyone!

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

1ped10k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ped10k/i_got_over_my_ex_in_23_weeks_heres_how_i_did_it/,I got over my ex in 2-3 weeks. Here's how I did it.,"We were both in our mid-twenties, and even though we’d only been together for a year, the what-ifs and unfinished pieces felt huge. I’ve always been the kind of person who gets stuck on exes for years, so this breakup hit in that same familiar way at first.

The truth is, getting over someone only really starts when you genuinely want to heal. Staying in contact, searching for closure, trying to understand their reasons never leads anywhere helpful. Nothing they could say would make the pain disappear, and replaying those explanations only makes old wounds deeper. Blocking them, not checking their profiles, not texting, isn’t petty, it’s self-preservation, it’s choosing yourself and whatever comes next for you.

Reconnecting with who I was without them became a big part of the process. Even when I didn’t feel like it, I forced myself back into the things I used to enjoy, and slowly, the good feelings came back with them. I leaned on my friends, cried, vented, sat with my support system, they cared for me in ways my ex no longer did, and that truth was painful but necessary to accept. Sometimes love isn’t enough to keep someone in your life, no matter how much you want it to be.

One thing that helped more than I expected was using the ""[Refeel](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/refeel-get-over-your-ex/id6748295768)"" app, it grounded me when my thoughts spiraled and helped me understand that healing wasn’t just about distraction, it was about reframing the story I kept repeating in my head. It gave me structure on the days when I felt like I was falling apart and helped me stop romanticizing a version of the relationship that never truly existed.

I started writing down what I actually wanted in a partner, and seeing clearly all the things my ex couldn’t give helped the anger surface, and anger, honestly, was useful for a while, it made space for forgiveness later, both for them and for myself. I did what I thought was right with the information I had, and there was no changing the past or rewriting it in my head. The only way forward was accepting that and choosing not to stay stuck.

Being single for a while felt necessary, even when the loneliness crept in, not rushing to replace them, not chasing distraction after distraction gave me time to breathe. At some point, without noticing exactly when, they went from occupying every thought to barely crossing my mind. The guilt of moving on showed up too, along with moments of missing small things, voices, routines, memories, but those feelings faded bit by bit.

They moved on as well, maybe quickly, maybe not, it didn’t matter, their choices didn’t define my value or our past. Whether they cared deeply or barely at all, the meaning I gave myself had to come from me, not from the way they handled the aftermath.

I never expected to reach the point I’m at now. A few weeks after the breakup, I remember feeling completely overwhelmed, certain I couldn’t go through all that pain again, but now I’m okay, more than okay actually, maybe even happier than I was when we were together. There’s no more confusion, no more analyzing mixed signals, no more emotional knots to untangle, just space, peace, and a life that feels solid again, without a void I’m desperate to fill.

Some smaller things helped too, journaling, writing unsent letters, practicing small moments of gratitude like acknowledging a good coffee or a funny moment during the day, these tiny things slowly stitched me back together, helping me feel whole again.

Three weeks later, I realized I truly was over them, not waiting for a crash, not pretending, just done. I ended up seeing who they were more clearly, without the emotional fog, and with that clarity, letting go became effortless.

1ped0ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ped0ja/dream_premium/,Dream Premium,"A couple years ago, an advertisement began playing in my dreams for a product that doesn’t exist.

I know it wasn’t a fake ad that my brain constructed using a conglomeration of glimpses and memories from my waking life because it was the same ad every time. No dream logic nonsense and no alterations to its organization. Every night when I entered REM sleep, I’d start dreaming, and midway through—no matter if I was leaping across a blazing forest or vomiting teeth onto a public bathroom floor—a pop-up screen would appear, like the ones that might open a new tab on your computer and download malware if you click the wrong “X” option. Centered on the pop-up were the same two sentences in 8-bit font:

*Don’t Just Dream. Dream Premium!*

Then, the dream would blackout and end. I always woke up cold, my sheets a sweaty mess, with five minutes to spare before my alarm went off.

I was working as a “Diligent and Professional Team Energy Service Technician” at the time for a small tech company named Sublimental Enterprises that, according to Google Maps last time I checked, is now permanently closed. I wouldn’t be surprised if, by the time you’re reading this, any mention of Sublimental Enterprises is completely missing from the Internet. They seemed like the type of company that could disappear at a moment’s notice. Despite the job description’s vague details and their store’s location being in a mostly abandoned strip mall on the rough side of my hometown, I applied. Financial desperation will get people into the oddest of situations, I guess.

My responsibilities varied daily. Sometimes I’d greet customers at the door for the entire shift, which lasted from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Sometimes I worked the register and polished the display screens of Sublimental-brand phones. Sometimes I cleaned the bathroom, although I never handled restock.

I wasn’t the only employee, of course. Todd’s shift overlapped with mine, and I didn’t see the other employees until it was their clock-in time or unless our manager, Brie, decided to emerge from the back office to check on us. Todd was a comic book’s equivalent of the quintessential nerd archetype. Thick horn-rimmed glasses, patchy stubble, and a Beatles-style haircut the same color as a turned-off phone screen. He never stopped smiling. What confused me about him was how he looked out of place in the uniform, like he was meant to be wearing a suit and tie instead of a collared shirt and khakis. Brie, on the other hand, looked exactly like an athletic, working mom with her hair pulled back into a tight ponytail and an expression of disapproval plastered to her face every time she spoke to me. She was destined to wear that uniform, as if her job was a play and the part of “manager” was created just for her.

A few months into my employment, I finally decided to bring up the advertisements to Todd in hopes he might know something—or, potentially, be experiencing the same thing himself. I kept my voice low while we polished phone screens together in case Brie might overhear and scold us for talking crazy on company time.

“It’s weird,” I told him. “It’s been happening every night since I started working here. I haven’t woken up well-rested in months. I’ll be dreaming normally for a while, and then—boom. *Don’t Just Dream. Dream Premium!* It even pops up during my nightmares.”

Todd’s constant grin turned taut. He slowed his polishing and glanced around the store as if searching for someone who had put me up to this chatter.

I said, “I’m not joking.”

“*Dream Premium*, huh?” he asked. He laughed a little, but it sounded like a mask for whatever panic must’ve been brewing inside him. “Never heard of it.”

He stepped away from the row of phones nearest us and, his eyes darting around the store, lurched toward a locked display case. He fumbled for a ring of keys in his pocket.

“But have *you* heard,” he said, frantic, “of the SE-Tablet Subli-model 2.0 Plus? It’s our newest design, and it’s got all sorts of great features! Such as…”

I listened to him recite Sublimental Enterprises’ tablet ad pitch as if he was going off-script and needed to save face somehow. It took him a few tries to unlock the display case and grab a packaged SE-Tablet without dropping the box or the keys. I didn’t bother cutting him off with a “never mind,” instead just walking away to go polish devices on the other side of the store. He trailed off into silence soon after. We didn’t talk for the remainder of our shared shift.

The next time I mentioned *Dream Premium* to anyone, it was during my lunch break a few months later. The dream advertisements had become increasingly invasive. My dreams barely began before a pop-up interrupted, and I’d wake up every two hours, forced out of sleep and struggling to fall back into unconsciousness. The ads’ resolution was improving, too. Instead of a pixelated font, *Dream Premium* was scrawled in pristine Helvetica, a blue pastel glow surrounding each letter that made the ad seem like a portal to another, more computerized dreamscape.

Brie walked into the breakroom for a noontime cup of coffee as I sat down with my lasagna microwave meal. There was only one chair at the folding table, so she remained standing when she turned to talk to me. The coffee machine gurgled and hissed beside her.

“You look awful,” she said.

I nearly forgot to set my plastic fork down before touching the shadows sagging beneath my eyes and almost poked myself. No amount of concealer could counteract this much exhaustion.

“I think my blood is seventy percent energy drink,” I replied. “I haven’t been sleeping well.”

She raised a manicured eyebrow at me. The coffee machine gave a final screech to indicate its job’s completion.

“Tired employees aren’t good for business.”

“I’d be less tired if I wasn’t getting ads in my sleep.” I prodded the cheesy top of my lasagna, its surface generally indifferent to my fork’s prongs. “*Don’t Just Dream. Dream Premium!* What even *is* that? The ads don’t tell me what *Dream Premium* does, by the way. I bet it’s not even a good product or subscription or whatever.”

Brie sipped her coffee and stared for a long while at me. Then, she asked, “Have you told Tom about this?”

“Tom? You mean… Todd?”

“Todd. Right. I meant Todd. You’ve told him?”

“Yeah, but he clearly didn’t believe me.” I sighed and shoved a forkful of lasagna into my mouth.

Brie lifted her phone out of her back pocket and appeared to answer a text with one hand, still holding her coffee cup in the other. She said, “I’ve heard of this thing called lucid dreaming. Maybe you should try that? Dismiss the advertisement that way?”

Before I could remark upon the simple genius of her suggestion, she strolled out of the breakroom and retreated to her office. After lunch, I lingered by her office door and listened as best as I could. She was talking no louder than a murmur to someone—on her phone, I assumed—so I didn’t catch much. What I did hear was a single fragment:

“—faster than expected… Prepare for—”

I spent the rest of my afternoon and evening after clock-out researching lucid dreaming: methods on how to train yourself to do it, estimates on how long it takes to do it consistently, advice on how to remain lucid once you awaken inside your dream, stuff like that. These preparations took me a solid month before I managed to succeed. That success was short-lived.

My dream began like any other dream might. I was crawling through some sort of funhouse-style space that slightly resembled my childhood doctor’s office, motivated by a vague notion that I was being chased but couldn’t look behind me. Then, the pop-up appeared:

*Don’t Just Dream. Dream Premium!*

It was more recognizable as a part of the dreamscape than anything else surrounding me, and this recognition shifted my perception of the environment into awareness that it was, in fact, a dream. I became lucid. I could feel the weight of my own body inside the dreamscape, could touch the pop-up screen and feel that, too: warm, like a gaming laptop left running for too long. I traced my index finger up to the ad’s “X” button and clicked it.

The pop-up disappeared.

My triumph lasted a mere three seconds before the dreamscape glitched. Everything around me red-blue shifted and then transitioned into stark whiteness. I heard what sounded like a bubble forming and knew another pop-up was waiting for me to turn around and acknowledge it. I did.

Three sentences hovered in front of me, white text on a royal blue error screen:

*Uh oh!*

*It looks like you’re using an ad blocker.*

*Please refresh your consciousness.*

My lucidity shot away from me in a blast of static screaming. I woke up, sweat-soaked once again, my eyes dry and stinging.

I arrived late to my shift that morning and ran into the 6 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. employee who I never learned the name of. She wasn’t wearing a name tag on her uniform and looked stunned that I had approached her in the first place. I stopped her in the parking lot outside the store.

“Hey, listen, I know this is going to sound crazy, but do you get ads in your sleep, too? *Dream Premium*? Have you tried refreshing your consciousness?”

She stared at me with horrified eyes. I waited for her to speak. She glanced back at the storefront, then over my shoulder at what I assumed was her car, and resumed looking at me.

She whispered, “I’m not supposed to talk to you,” and brushed past me, car keys in hand.

“Wait, what?”

I followed her to her vehicle; she got into the driver’s seat, slammed the door shut, and stared up at me through the closed window, putting the key into the ignition but not twisting it.

I raised my voice so she could hear me through the glass, asking, “What do you mean you can’t talk to me? What’s going on?”

As if remembering she had the option to drive her car—that it was functional at all—she started the engine and put the car in reverse. I stepped back as she pulled out of her parking space and drove off, aware that she was watching me in her rear-view mirror until I was out of sight.

Sublimental Enterprises had the most amount of customers I had ever seen enter the store during my shift that day, so Todd and I were too busy to converse with each other except for when I had to borrow his keys to unlock a display case. The customer wanted that Subli-model tablet Todd had talked about before. I reached for the same box he had shown me. It was empty.

“Um, sorry,” I said, “let me—let me get a different one from backstock. I don’t know what’s wrong with this one…”

I hurried to the storage room adjacent to the breakroom and made a beeline for the shelves labeled “TABLETS, ETC.” None of the cardboard compartments had been opened; their shipping labels were blacked out. I slit the tape open on one using my thumbnail and reached in to grab a new tablet box. Empty. I checked the other compartments. Empty. Whatever was going on, surely my manager would be able to explain. Brie was the type of woman who could handle anything thrown her way, I thought, and after concluding that she wasn’t in her office, I marched to the checkout counter to use the store’s personal phone by the register. Brie’s number was written on a notecard taped beside the phone stand.

Todd watched me from across the store, even as he showed off Sublimental Enterprises’ new wireless earbud model to a small group of customers. The other customers milled around like actors who never learned how to improvise. The one who was waiting for me to return with the correct tablet box was gone.

I called Brie. She answered at the first ring. The anxiety in my chest swelled closer to an all-out attack.

“Hello?”

“Brie! Brie, listen, something really weird is happening and I need you to come in as fast as possible, please, I—I don’t know what’s going on! Inventory’s fake! And that early morning shift girl wouldn’t talk to me, and Todd won’t stop smiling, and I don’t know how to refresh my consciousness! Please, Brie—”

“You’re just tired. You’re not thinking clearly. Go home early.”

“What? But it’s so busy here! I can’t leave Todd by himself—”

“Go home early,” she repeated. “Get some rest. Dream.”

I didn’t have the chance to reply before she ended the call. In a paranoid haze, I clocked out, grabbed my lunchbox from the breakroom, and left without giving the display case keys back to Todd.

What happened after that was told to me by paramedics. I have no memory of the car accident I got into on the way home, nor of my ramblings about my restlessness, my coworkers being planted actors, and my personal ad-induced hell. The emergency medical hospital soon transferred me to a mental institution where I spent several weeks on low-dose sedatives and antipsychotics until I was able to convince myself that I hadn’t been an unknowing participant in an elaborate dream tech advertisement experiment. The *Dream Premium* pop-ups stopped. After I was discharged, I went to live with my parents and searched for a new job. Sublimental Enterprises never inquired after me, but I did receive one final paycheck via direct deposit.

My life has been relatively normal these past couple years since that incident. I don’t work in retail anymore. I quit energy drinks. I sleep eight hours every night, uninterrupted.

I’m telling you all this now because of what occurred this morning. I’m afraid. My time at that mental institution was comparable to the emotional experience of working at Sublimental Enterprises, and I don’t want to go back to either. But if what I think is happening is, in fact, happening, I just might have to walk through those hospital doors again. Someone please tell me: Am I living in a nightmare?

Over breakfast, I was scrolling through my phone, catching up on my new job’s workplace group chat to see if anyone needs their shift covered next week. A new text loaded in from my manager, Ray: *Hey all. Have you seen this yet? Looks pretty cool!*

He sent a YouTube link. The username was generic; randomly generated. When the video started, I dropped my phone onto my plate of pancakes and screamed. It was a fifteen-second still frame of my dreamscape from last night, Helvetica text stamped center overtop:

*Don’t Just Dream. Dream Premium!*

1pecx3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppsWithoutSub/comments/1pecx3h/i_created_a_sudoku_app_without_knowing_how_to/,I created a Sudoku app without knowing how to play Sudoku,"Hey everyone!

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**  
[https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/sudoku-daily-brain-workout/id6748236600)

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

I've been apartment hunting lately and just wanted some opinions. I found an apartment in East Liberty that I love due to the layout and location, but it's at the top of what I'd want to spend in rent. I love that it's in a walkable area and near coffee shops, grocery stores, and on a bus line especially since I'm uncomfortable driving in snow or bad weather. While I'd love to just jump on it and commit, I also want to consider more cost-friendly options and was recommended looking downtown by a friend. I found that comparable apartments there can be $600-$1000 cheaper than the East Liberty apartment, even including a parking pass. 

  
Since I'm new to the city, I was curious on what everyone thinks about living downtown. Is it safe for me to walk my dog around at night? What's it like to be there and how's the transit? I'm more drawn to places that are walkable and have lots to do, as I don't prefer driving in general and like to take my dog when I go places. Thanks for your time, any insight is helpful.

I'm looking for any advice on starting small with a coffee business, but as the title suggests my real focus/ passion is into making a community hangout space/ third place business. 

  
I have a passion for coffee, and I recently took a trip to italy where I was really inspired by the coffee culture and the third space culture they have there. One place really stood out to me. The coffee was inexpensive and great quality, the place was decorated with a bunch of art, plenty of cozy places to sit and tables for laptops, it looked like almost all the glassware & furniture was thrifted, and it kinda gave me a vision on what I wanted to replicate.

  
Anyways, I'm looking for advice on how to start small, so as to gain experience running my own business. I have 3 years of experience working as a barista and a passion for coffee, but in my mind the main purpose for the business is that it serves as a third space where people can come to hangout, study, play games, and what not. Great inexpensive coffee, food, drinks, hopefully live music and events eventually, are the products that draw people in, but the main purpose or ""problem"" the business solves is it creates a third space for people to hangout at.

  
How can I start small? It seems that with a business like this there's a massive upfront cost of all the equipment, leasing the building, renovation, employees, marketing, product itself, etc. etc. I'm not intending to try to turn this thing into the next Starbucks, but I'm looking for ways to start small and gain experience running and managing my own business without the massive upfront cost and risk that goes into a coffee business like this.



Any coffee shop, restaurant, bar, live music venue, etc. owners willing to share their story on how they started out? Anything is greatly appreciated.

1pecpdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1pecpdb/resentment_after_children/,Resentment after children,"Hello all,
I’m looking for some godly advice on dealing with resentment for husband after having children. 

Context: I (26F) have two boys (3 and 10 months) with my husband (27M).  He works 5 days a week and sometimes a few hours on the weekends too. He is self-employed in a labor intensive job as a mechanic. He works between 8-10 hours a day starting around 9:00 am.  I work two days a week from home 8:00-4:00. My MIL watches the three year old and a sitter comes over to watch the baby.  

My husband is not a morning person. He is the type to set 10 alarms in order to wake  up. I’m convinced he would sleep through a tornado. He will generally wake up right before he goes to work. The children generally wake up between 6-7.  Now since I wake up when I here the baby cry I get up and go take care of him when he wakes which leads to me waking up with the kids every single day.  I feed them and dress them and watch them play and try to drink my coffee as peacefully as possible. 

I even do this on the days I work so some days I’m essentially waking up at 7, getting my oldest dressed, putting the baby with my sleeping husband, taking the three year old to grandmas, driving back, then getting the 10 month old dressed and given to sitter. I then work for eight hours, pick up my oldest son, drive home and watch them for another 2-3 hours before my husband gets home. The baby also wakes 2-3 times at night so my sleep is very broken.

The other 3 days I don’t work and will usually  wake up with the children and take the children to the gym with me at 8:00 am and hangout with them at home the rest of the day.

When he does get home he happily plays with them, will volunteer to bring dinner home, etc. He will also help clean the house, do home projects, maintenance and he is an amazing worker and very honest. 

I guess what I need help with is I just feel angry all the time and ungrateful and just…irritated that I don’t sleep as much or spend so much more time with the kids and doing tasks. I don’t want to feel like this and I’ve been praying that I don’t feel this all the time.  Can someone please offer helpful advice.

“Who the hell do you think you are?” He asked, cocking his shotgun. 
“I told you, I’m Swedish. I’m not a Jew, I-I have my ID!” I retorted, reaching into my pocket for my father’s handgun. 
“I won’t fall for that trick. Smile for me.” He said, chuckling and stamping out his cigar. 
“Sir, this is hardly a time to smile. If I could just take my ID out-!” I stumbled backwards as I spoke, falling into the muddy ground. 
“Smile or you die.” 
I had not a choice. I grinned, displaying my shiny brass teeth alongside withered, yellow naturals. 
“Haha… Boy Wonder, it’s you!” The old rancher said, baffled. And then I stared down the barrel of his shotgun and thought but one word. Why?

Prologue
I rolled around in a cold, damp bed. It had rained hard for the last week, and my disenfranchised parents couldn’t possibly afford even a thatch roof to catch the rain. Our little Frankfurt cafe had been shut down and raided on Kristallnacht, a night which I had heard referenced many a time yet never described. All I knew was that everything was broken. The windows, the tables, and especially all my toys I had in the back. Everything that wasn’t bolted down was stolen. The entire place looked like a jailhouse. They even stripped the paint. My family was now living in a skinny alleyway in northern Frankfurt, with no roof and two bare mattresses infested with lice. The air around us tasted like Marks. Sour, metallic. We heard gunshots every night. Screams, others. I was kicked out of school; I had to learn from the homeless and crippled. I learned how to clobber birds and set fires, to scheme and steal. It was my only way to survive with my parents having to work under abusive bosses at the tavern. One night, I came back to the alley with muddy boots. 
“Mom? Father?” I shouted, making small mice skitter from beneath my bed after having presumably gnawed on it for hours. Cotton spilled out. 
“Gone again?” I asked to the sky, placing warm winter gloves over my hands despite it being only April. The rain cut like razors. An old hat from my family’s time in Italy sat on my head, heavy and tight. A gash cut through the top. Rain seeped in. I stomped northward to Tennenbaum’s tavern, a bar and inn where my parents both worked as cooks. I sprinted against the heavy wind, being tailed by imaginary footsteps.

Footsteps. That's all I remember looking back from now, all of it was footsteps. Stilettos, combat boots, hoof beats, even the treads of a tank. It’s all footsteps. Behind me, around me, ahead of me. Footsteps. Heavy as summer sun or light as autumn snow. Footsteps, threatening yet grounding. Footsteps, ever definite. Hear them behind you, you are tailed. Hear them ahead, you are battled. Hear them beside you, you are accepted. I didn’t hear them beside me a lot. And then, as sudden as the fall of a foot, a hand lay upon my shoulder.

“Hello, child.” An old voice said. “Are you lost?”
I turned around. Nary a face in sight. A hand on either shoulder. I turned around again.
“Return home. We have a curfew.” It said, before I twisted my head around to see a hideous beast’s face. And yet, all I saw was a man. Sharp features, a scruffy beard marring his jaw, and two grey eyes like murky water. I saw a crimson armband on him. 
“Ah-ah! Sir, I don’t think that’s necessary. I need to meet my parents. At Tennenbaum’s Tavern.”  
“Bah, Scheiße. Get on home, you!” He shouted, grabbing me by the skin of my neck and pushing me into the wet road. My face fell into a puddle, and my nose bruised. I stood up, shaking my head. My intricately combed and quashed hair fell into messy long hair around my head, slight curls in each strand. Water dripped from my wet mop. I threw a reckless punch into the air, striking him in the knee. The man roared in pain, shoving me against a rough brick wall. My hands reached behind me to push him away, but he was too strong. He pressed me further into the wall, until my teeth touched the baked clay. It tore a tooth from the root, making blood drip from my gums. 
“Jüdischar bastard. Not even worth a fight.” He mumbled, dropping me to the sopping ground. My tears and blood dripped with the rain, mixing into an odd cocktail of despair. I rose to my feet, putting my wet hat into my coat’s pocket and running toward the tavern as the moon flew to the sky. 

I knocked desperately on the back door, banging on the glass before it opened, making me fall into the floor. I stood up with the assistance of a burly, bearded man and a pencil-thin woman. My parents. 
“Sohn, what happened to you?!” My father whispered urgently. I grinned a bloody grin, displaying my crusted yellow and red teeth. 
“Nichts, Vater. Just a street thug. But I was tough enough to beat him, I was!” I lied, fingering the gap where my tooth was. My mother pressed her sister’s old blue handkerchief to my maw. Red spread through the thin fabric. 
“Poor boy. He’ll need a brass tooth,” Said my mother, cupping my cheek. “His gums are damaged.”
“Mathilda, we can’t afford a brass tooth. We can barely afford bread!” My father shouted, causing a stir from the owner’s office. 
“Blast! Sohn, hide!” 
I raced out of the door, shutting and locking it. Sharp rain ran down my back. I shivered. The owner of the tavern, Herr Kluas, walked out from his office wielding a long belt. 
“What was that commotion? Who are you hiding?!” The muffled voice roared, snapping the belt. I tremble in fear for my parents as my father’s cheek was struck. He fell back, clutching his face. 
“Sir, our son! We need to feed him! Please, let us back to our work!” My mother pleaded, falling to her knees as tears streamed down her face. 
“You should have thought of that before you defied me!” He shouted, backhanding my mother into a cabinet. I couldn’t bear to watch. I ran back to our alley, stomping through puddles and retreating to my bed. I clutched the mattress tightly, trying my best to ignore the squeaks of mice inside. I fell asleep, wet and cold. Miserable. 

“Wake up!” A husky voice shouted, awaking me from my slumber. I recognized it as my father’s, but he looked different. He wore a tight army jacket with an armband, as well as a nazi officer’s cap. My mother was hunched over a desk wearing an oversized wedding gown. She was vomiting empty puke, and falling onto her knees. Neither of the outfits belonged to my parents. They were stolen. 
“I said wake up!” He continued as my mother held her head in her hands. I jumped from my bed as my mother fell to the brick street.
“Mama!” I shouted, racing to her and supporting her on my arms. 
“Your mother is dying, son. I’m being hunted. Don’t say anything to anybody. Here!” He said, taking the cap from his head and placing it onto mine. 
“Heil Hitler.” He muttered, encouraging me to repeat it. 
“Sieg Heil Hitler, Papa."" I said, a tear running from my eye. Even though the rain had stopped, our suffering had not. I hid inside an abandoned building nearby our alleyway. I stumbled around broken glass and wood chips, entering a relatively empty cabinet. More mice skittered out, squeaking slightly. I heard a slam against the brick wall. 
“Alfred Fresco! You are under arrest for theft, fraud, and treason against the Fuhrer!” A deep, angry voice shouted. I crouched to the window, peeking out just a bit. The man from the street last night held my dad against the bricks, out of his uniform. Father likely stole it from him. I looked for my mother, but alas, all I saw was a pale corpse. The cold woman’s body was once that of my mother. Tears streamed down my cheeks, but I halted my cries when the officer peeked in my direction. Father was hauled into a truck, and sent far, far away.  

My dad left behind one thing. An old Swiss revolver, with the barrel engraved with a man’s name. ‘Arthur’ it read, though the word was fogging. It came in a small leather holster that I fastened to my belt with a sharp pin. After crawling from the window, I rummaged through any container I could find, but I found nothing. The Gestapo took everything. Everything but my mother.

I stepped closer to the corpse, holding her hands to my cheeks. 
""Schlaf kleiner Hase, Schlaf, Schlaf, Schlaf. Schlaf kleiner hase, Weine nicht.” I sang through my tears, an old lullaby she sang to me. I couldn’t bear to look at her cold, pale face. I buried my face in her bosom, crying into the loose brideswear. As I held her, I noticed a slight bump in her belly. It pressed against my ribs, oddly warm. I debated with myself, deciding whether it would be improper to peek at her belly or not. I decided for it, morbid curiosity overtaking me. I pulled the dress up, looking at her belly. Engorged, veiny. I pressed my ear to it. Rumbling. 
“Little brother?” I asked, standing up and placing the dress over my mother's legs. 

I raised my cap, holding my hand over the smooth leather holster. I walked into the street, searching for old man Alfons. He taught me how to survive all day with mom and dad gone. 
“Zigarre! Zigarre! Zigarre für fünf Mark!"" A rough voice shouted, shaking a paper in the air. 
“Der alte Alfons!” I shouted, walking toward the homeless vagrant. 
“Ah! Kleiner Gavroche! I’ve been waiting for you. Here, have a cigar. And spend the day! Your Vater is… Oh, my, he’s dead, Kleiner Gavroche. Well, have two cigars.”
I took the tobacco, stuffing one into my pocket. I lit the other, pressing it to my lips and inhaling. The bitter smoke filled my lungs, slicing through and soothing my nerves. I breathed the smoke out, resting my hand on Alfons’ shoulder. 
“Nobody wants to give me a cigar, Gavroche. Is it because I’m French?” He said, laughing roughly, slapping his knee and clutching his chest. 
Der alte Alfons was an old man, around 73. He smoked cigars every day, begging on the streets for a fix. Despite his disheveled form, he claimed to have been quite handsome in his day. He had blue eyes, and a slim strand of dirty blonde hair. 
“Aha! This reminds me of 1902, when me and my old friend Henry Harris climbed the old alps, begging to god for cigars. Well, Henry, being the Nancy he was, wanted cigarettes. Ah, I miss him.” He said, slicing the tip of the cigar and lighting it again. 
“I reckon you never left the cities, old man. Willing to bet five marks.” I said, sucking down more smoke. 
“Ah, Kleiner Gavroche, ever the doubtful boy.” He called me, rummaging through his pack and pulling out a photo album. He opened it up, showing a picture of him alone in front of the alpine mountains. He held his hand out for my marks. 
“Erm, sir? Where’s Harris?” I asked, reaching for the photo.
“Why, he’s right in the picture! Dead center! You’re hard of seeing, you are, Kleiner Gavroche.” He stated firmly, oblivious to his madness.
“Alright, sir. Here are your marks. Have a wonderful day!” I shouted, walking backwards across the street.

 I shook my head, walking to the local bakery. I walked in, ringing a bell as a kind young woman walked to the front. Mademoiselle Uriel, oh how beautiful she was. Bouncy black curls, a centered button nose, and wonderfully fair skin. Oh, how I wished to behold her every moment of every day. To be held in her loving embrace, alas, it’s so far from me, but so close. 

“Hallo! One Pain au Chocolat, merci.” I said in broken French, sitting at one of the barstools. 
“Oh, mon Ami, your French seems to get worse every day!” She said, grabbing the pastry and sliding it across the bar. I reached into my pocket, grabbing nine Marks. I held them out, before my fingers were curled back into a fist by Uriel. The touch was magnificent. A blush swam up from my clavicle all the way to my forehead. 
“It’s free, Gavroche.” She giggled, sipping a glass of iced water. The way the water clung to her lips, making them shine like clean glass. I rested my head in my palm, a slim and genuine smile crossing my face. Even that annoying nickname Der alte Alfons gave me sounded wonderful from her rouge tongue. I scarfed down the pastry, my first food in two days, and swiftly crept out of the door.

I rested my back on a lamppost and finished my cigar, tossing it onto the street and stamping it out. I adjusted my hat. I bound my fingers together, pressed my palm to my heart, and pointed my hand to the sky. 
“Heil hitler… heil Hitler. Heil Hitler!” I said, testing the phrase in my mouth. I skipped down the street, hailing to everybody I saw and plastering a bloody yellow smile upon my face. I shouted to the sky, dancing all the way to the train station. 

The conductor had never met the Kleiner Gavroche. For all that was good, that Kleiner Gavroche was dead. I shook his hand and bowed my head, grabbing my last nine marks to pay for my ticket.
“It’s ten marks… bah, never mind! I’ll take the nine! Hop into the car, and your name is… what is it? I don’t think you’ve met me.” He said, chuckling and clicking his pen.
“Soldatenjunge… Yes, my name is Joseph Soldatenjunge.” I fabricated, grabbing my ticket and stepping up the stairs. 
“Good luck, boy wonder.” 

Footsteps beside me. 

Act I
Joseph Soldatenjunge
The train was a world beyond any I had known. Men and women drinking coffee, tea, and cocoa. Soulful music played all the ride, and cigarette smoke filled the air. I wandered through the cars of the train, seeing the beautiful wallpapers and carpets. 

Footsteps behind me. A hand on my shoulder. I turn around, seeing the conductor. I relaxed, dropping my shoulders. 
“Your car, friend. Right this way, young man.” He guided, opening a door to a velvet carpeted room lined with plush chairs. Boys filled each seat, all wearing nazi caps. I sat myself in the back next to a young Greek girl. Her hair was blonde and braided, and her hands were trembling. 

“Hallo…” she said, twirling her braid. 
“Hello! My name is Nor- Joseph! Joseph Soldatenjunge! It’s a pleasure to meet you. What business do you have in this car? Are you with the… Hitler youth?” I asked, excited to see a pretty girl my age, though my cover was almost blown. 
A silent and empty tear fell from her chin onto a closed envelope. The droplet spread through the thick paper and left it damp and mushy. I wiped the tear from her cheek with the back of my hand. 
“Großer Bruder…” she mumbled, sniffling. 
“Is everything okay, Fräulein?” I asked, mentally palming my face. Of course she wasn’t okay, Joseph, she’s crying. 
“It’s alright… it’s just that… My big brother is dead. Dead the week I join the youth.” She said, sucking back her tears and phlegm. I placed a hand on her back as she sniffled, trying to comfort her. She was warm, wearing an oversized army jacket the size of the one the officer wore. It must have been her brother’s. I hummed the old lullaby to her as I patted her back, trying to soothe her aching mind. 
“What is your name, Dear?” I questioned, trying to get into her good graces. 
“Z-Zoe… Adamos. My brother was Adam Adamos… A funny name, right…?” She said, forcing a thinly veiled smile. Her pain was infectious. 

Despite the girl’s sobs and mine impending, all I could hear was the rumble and tread of the train. It was so overpowering, I forgot my struggles. And the girl’s. I was lost in the rumble and tread. I imagined myself a soldier, a tank battalion at my side as I armed myself with a gun. 

“Little Soldier.” That’s what mama called me. Whether I had just scraped my knee or had been kicked out of school forever, I was always her little soldier, soldiering on. Back when we still had our café, I would trumpet in front, advertising to anybody who could hear. I would jump around on my stubby little feet, clicking them together in the air. I’d puff my cheeks out, against my father’s wishes. My mother even bought me special-made tap shoes to wear as I played and danced. Those were the few times when I heard footsteps ahead me and not gotten beaten.  

I awoke with a heavy toothache. I looked down to see my hand on Zoe’s. I blushed. I snapped my hand to my chest, looking at the man at the head of the car. He had an overbite, and his teeth were a blackis

We are expecting our second child end of January and would love to do something special on one wall of the nursery. We weren’t able to do this for our first (she’s 3 year old) so I would like to make sure that we do something for her room as well. So all in all 2 walls.

Cannot decide between wallpaper or decal. When I look for wallpaper online, the options are limitless and so overwhelming. It also feels like a much more permanent thing to do.

The other option we are considering is we paint the wall a nice base color (like a peach or light coffee/ camel or sage green) and put on some fun decals.

Wise people, what do you suggest? ",3,1764884099.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

Also some light lunch options, full coffee menu, kids menu, take away packs for high tea on the go.

We're in early planning stages but I'd love to get some feedback from the community on what you'd like to see at such a place if it's somewhere you'd go.

But a man has needs, physical needs, the kind a delicate flower like her could never satisfy. I’m discreet with my arrangements, careful not to embarrass her publicly. Really, it’s considerate.
My phone buzzed. A text from Krystal, my marketing consultant in Miami: Missing you. When are you coming back?
I glanced at Snow’s smiling wedding photo on my desk, turned it face down, and replied: Soon, beautiful.
But how could my devoted wife possibly send singers to serve me divorce papers?
“Congratulations, Preston Darlington, you’re getting divorced today!” The singer’s voice was operatic, echoing through my glass-walled office. “It’s a girl—three different girls! You’ve been cheating left and right—”
Pop! Pop! Glitter filled the air.
Outside, faces pressed against the glass, everyone watching.
My face burned. But everything’s under control. 
A few gestures, one good apology, and she’ll be exactly where she belongs: in my arms.
————————
Snow
I practice my smile in the antique mirror, the one Preston’s mother, Bitsy, calls “a charming relic.” The woman staring back at me is a stranger in a designer dress. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes. It’s a carefully constructed curve of the lips, a mask of contentment I’ve perfected over six years of marriage. I wonder when I stopped recognizing my own face. When I traded Snow Holloway for the polished, hollow version of Mrs. Preston Darlington III.
My heart gives a slow, heavy thud against my ribs. It’s Thursday evening. Dinner with the Darlingtons. A weekly ritual of quiet judgment and veiled insults, served on bone china with silver that’s been in the family since the Mayflower, or so Bitsy claims.
Preston is waiting at the bottom of the staircase, scrolling through his phone, his thumb moving in a relentless, impatient rhythm. He looks up, his cold eyes doing a quick, critical scan from my sensible heels to my understated pearl earrings. He adjusts his cufflinks, a nervous tic he mistakes for a power move. “Good. You’re on time.” He offers his arm, his touch cool and proprietary, not an invitation but a summons. “Mother and Father are already in the dining room.”
The dining room is a cavern of mahogany and history, dominated by a portrait of Preston’s great-grandfather looking sternly down his nose at all who dare to eat in his presence. The air is thick with the scent of lemon polish, hothouse lilies, and old money.
“Snow, darling,” Bitsy says, her voice thin and sharp as a needle. She air-pecks the space beside my cheek, the scent of her Chanel No. 5 clinging to me like a shroud. “That dress is… suitable.”
“Thank you, Bitsy,” I say, my practiced smile clicking into place. “You look lovely.”
Dinner is a masterclass in passive aggression, and I am its primary subject. Bitsy recounts the latest triumphs of my sister-in-law, Muffy, whose son just got accepted into a preschool that apparently has a twenty-year waiting list. My own career, the one I was so proud of before Preston convinced me to abandon it, is never mentioned. It’s a ghost at the table, a reminder of a version of me I can barely recall.
“I saw you had to sell off a few acres last year,” Bradford says suddenly, his first direct address to me all evening. He stabs a piece of asparagus with surgical precision. “For the taxes, I assume. Farming is such a… quaint profession. Unpredictable.”
The casual disdain for my parents, for the rich, dark soil they’ve cultivated my entire life, sends a hot spike of anger through my chest. I grip the stem of my water goblet, my knuckles white. “My parents love what they do,” I say, my voice dangerously even. “They find value in things beyond a stock portfolio.”
Preston pats my hand, a gesture that looks affectionate to his parents but feels like a clamp on my wrist. A warning. “What my wife means,” he says, his smile not reaching his eyes, “is that she’s very proud of her family’s… rustic charm. Aren’t you, darling?”
My smile feels brittle enough to crack. “Of course.”
Later, as we’re having coffee in the drawing-room, Preston leans back. He’s in his element now, holding court. “My new assistant is working out splendidly. An absolute shark, and drop-dead gorgeous too.” He says with a certain relish, watching me for a reaction. “She’s stunning. A real distraction around the office. Ambitious, too. Reminds me of you, back in your MBA days.”
The comparison is a deliberate cruelty. “That’s nice,” I say, taking a sip of my coffee. “Is she competent?”
Preston’s brow furrows. It’s not the reaction he expected. He was fishing for insecurity, a spark of the drama he seems to crave and despise in equal measure. My genuine indifference puzzles him.
“She’s got an MBA from Pace,” he says, a little defensively. “Of course, she’s competent.”
I nod, letting the topic die. I don’t care about his new assistant, who is “a real distraction around the office”. I don’t care about the club or the gala or Muffy’s overachieving toddler. I don’t care about any of it.
Back in our bedroom, the silence is a heavy blanket. 
I’m about to climb into my side of the king-sized bed, the acre of mattress that separates us every night, when I see it. Preston’s phone, lying face-up on his nightstand. The screen is still glowing. He must have just set it down before stepping into the shower, too arrogant or distracted to think I’d ever dare look. He never leaves it unlocked. Never.
My heart starts that heavy thud again, but this time it’s faster. A nervous, frantic rhythm. I glance toward the dressing room door. I can hear the shower running. This is my window. Maybe my only window. A voice in my head, the one that sounds like Bitsy, tells me to walk away. To be a lady. But another voice, a whisper I haven’t heard in years, the one that sounds like Snow Holloway, says, Look.
I pick up the phone. My hands are shaking so badly that I almost drop it. The screen is open to a text thread. Not with a man’s name. Not with “Tennis Lessons”. Oh no, the contact is Hot Butt, who I assume is his assistant based on what I’ve read. He’s been droning on about “my new assistant” for months now — he does this with all of them, never bothering to learn their names since they rarely last more than a year. Just refers to them as “my new assistant” until the next one arrives. Never mentions her actual name, just how hot or distracting she is. Just like he did tonight.
My breath catches as another text comes in. I scroll up, my thumb clumsy.
Hot Butt: He’s buying it. Merica thinks I’m just your loyal assistant who feels bad for him.
Preston: Perfect. Keep playing sympathetic.
Hot Butt: Took him to lunch like you suggested. Third glass of wine, and he started complaining about his wife being suspicious. I played dumb, asked the right questions.
Preston: And?
Hot Butt: He told me everything.
Preston: Excellent. My father will be thrilled. Once we have solid proof, Merica will resign quietly or lose everything in his divorce. About time too. He’s been a thorn in my side for too long.
My mind spins. Merica. A senior partner at Darlington Investments who clearly has something on the family, something that’s kept him protected all these years. So Preston is collecting blackmail material. No doubt evidence of an affair that would destroy Merica’s marriage and trigger his prenup. Mutually assured destruction. The bitter irony isn’t lost on me — Preston is weaponizing infidelity against someone else while doing the exact same thing. I keep scrolling, my thumb moving faster, the world narrowing to the glowing screen.
Hot Butt: And what about the other thing you asked me to deal with?
Preston: She suspects nothing. She’s too busy planning charity events and hiding from my mother. She’s not smart enough to see what’s happening.
Hot Butt: Don’t underestimate her.
Preston: Please. My wife is a decorative asset. Nothing more.
The words hit me, but not in the way they should. There’s no pain. No gut-wrenching sob. Instead, a strange, icy calm washes over me. It’s the feeling of confirmation. The final piece of a puzzle I didn’t even know I was solving. A memory flashes, unbidden: our first date. He’d told me he loved my “unspoiled, authentic nature.” He’d called me a breath of fresh air. It was all a lie. He wasn’t looking for a partner; he was looking for a project. A beautiful, unpolished stone he could cut and shape to fit his setting.
Decorative asset.
He’s right. That’s what I’ve become. But he’s also wrong. My parents named me Snow, not Doormat. And I have an MBA, just like his shark of an assistant. Or should I call her hot butt? I’m not stupid. I’m just… sedated.
Then I see the next text. It’s from a different number, a thread with a woman named Ashleigh.
Ashleigh: I miss you. Our night at The Plaza was amazing. I want to do it again.
Preston: I know. Soon, I promise. Once I handle my wife.
Ashleigh: You said that last time. Is she really going to sign the post-nup?
Preston: She’ll do what she’s told. She always does.
A post-nup. There it is. The cheap, predictable betrayal I knew was there but hadn’t bothered to look for. So that’s his plan. Lock me in tighter, strip away what little protection I have left. Make sure I get nothing if I ever wise up and leave. He’s been three steps ahead this whole time — or so he thinks.
I exit the messages and tap his email app. I spot it immediately: a receipt from The Plaza Hotel. A room for the night. A charge of two hundred dollars at the Champagne Bar. A charge for room service at 2 AM. Last Tuesday. The night he was supposedly working late, and left for work before I woke up on Wednesday morning. The total is more than my parents make in a week of selling their organic produce at the farmer’s market.
My business brain, the part of me I thought was long dead, kicks into gear. I don’t cry. I don’t throw the phone. My hands, suddenly steady, move with methodical precision. I work fast, my thumb flying across the screen. Screenshots of everything. The texts with Ashleigh. The hotel receipt. The conversation with Hot Butt. I email them to an account I’ve had since college and then delete the screenshots and emails from the sent folder.
One more thing. I pull up the contact labeled “Hot Butt” and copy the number to my own phone. I might need it.
A strange sense of freedom, sharp and exhilarating, floods my veins. I’m not devastated. I’m not heartbroken. I’m liberated. This isn’t the end of my world. It’s the beginning of a war.
I place the phone back on the nightstand, exactly as I found it, just as the shower turns off. I slide into bed, my back to his side.
Preston emerges, smelling of expensive soap, and gets into bed without a word. Soon, his breathing deepens into the soft snores I’ve listened to for six years. He’s sleeping the peaceful sleep of a man who believes he’s in complete control.

I'd flinch whenever I was within a few feet of any dog, pet or stray, and I'd scream when they barked or came up to me and put their snout or showed their teeth. 

I'm currently renting a room in a foreign country with a family, and they have an old dog. A white Swiss shepherd. At first I thought he's just someone I could avoid, he seems calm and to keep to himself. Then I gathered the courage to pet him. He has the softest, silkiest fur, especially on the top of his head. Then I began petting him more often. He came up to me a few times for pets when I was sad. 

Fast forward a few days, and I'm feeding him, playing with him, and even took him for a walk with a more experienced friend. (Which was a good decision, considering this little guy had a penchant for running into traffic and is too big for me to effectively restrain.) My photo gallery is full of photos and videos of him, and I'm gushing about him to every family member and friend like I'm a toddler with a shiny new toy. He comes up to me when I wake up and go to the kitchen and makes sure I give him his morning pets before I'm allowed to touch my coffee. The last few nights he's even taken to sleeping outside my bedroom door. 

He's not even my dog and I love him so much. He's such a good boy.",1,1764883917.0,CasualConversation,2,1.0,False
1pechkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pechkm/my_profesor_29_male_asked_me_18f_on_a_date/,My profesor (29 male) asked me (18f) on a date,"Hi guys, so this happened today and I just have to share what happened because it has been an emotional day. I (18F) am in my first year of university, I am an international student at a UK based university and am doing my foundation year because I graduated high school a year early. I had mentally set aside four years for university so adding a foundation year felt like a good idea. The classes in my specific program are very small and feel more like a high school class at time rather than a traditional lecture. The class this specific profesor teaches consists of about fifteen people. I am a bit of an overachiever and a teachers pet, I acknowledge it and know it’s just how I am. So because of my people pleasing and overarching nature I sit near my professors desk. My eyes are also not the best so I like to sit near the front so I can actually see. Last Thursday my profesor asked me to stay after class to talk to me about my mark on a recent summative assignment. This mark was worth 80% of my grade so I worked very very hard on it. He was a bit harsh to say the least. He asked if this was my best work because it wasn’t at a university level and compared to my friends in the class (19 and 20f) I did not do as good and he did not want me to compare myself to them. This sent me spiraling. I’m an anxious person and I hadn’t even received my marks yet so now I had to wait a week to even get this mark back. This Monday all marks were released and I got a 79 which is first class honors in my program. He asked to speak to me again today about my mark and I showed him my grade and how I was a bit confused about why he said the grade was bad when I was in first class honors. He said that the mark was correct and that he mistook the grade for the person before me on the register when he pulled me aside. This didn’t make any sense to me. He knew me by name and my paper by name so how could he mistake me for the person before me on the resister? He then asked if I could see his notes and feedback and I said no because I couldn’t see it. He said he would email it to me so I stood and waited while he tried to get his computer to load, this is where it gets weird. In a quick moment of silence he asked me if I would be interested in getting some coffee with him next semester (he is not going to be my profesor next semester so I would no longer be his student, just someone who happens to go to his university). I was caught off guard because that was not where I was expecting the conversation to go whatsoever. I stood there for a moment and then asked how old he was. I don’t know why that is what came to mind but it was. He laughed and said he was in his late twenties and that he was a good bit older than I am. I already knew how old he was because he mentioned being born in 1996 in a previous class. I did the math in my head and realized he is 29. I turned 18 in September. I was deeply uncomfortable with the situation and at this point everyone in the classroom had left and it was just us. I thanked him for his help and got ready to leave. He seemed surprised I didn’t acknowledge his proposal and I got nervous so I said I would get back to him about it and basically ran out of the classroom.  I spoke to my flatmate about it as I had a two hour break until my next lecture. They told me I need to report it as it’s incredibly inappropriate, which I agree with. My concern is that because he didn’t specify if it was a date, and in the moment I didn’t ask for clarification, that it might not be taken seriously and could be passed off as platonic. He is also very close friends with the rest of the staff and I’ve seen him talking and joking with them in the past. I plan to talk to student welfare team despite this because I know this needs to be reported. While the interaction itself wasnt forceful I know the power dynamics are completely inappropriate. I’m worried about becoming the girl who reported the teacher for asking her out. I’ve worked so hard to get here, I care about my education so much and don’t want to potentially strain any of my (obviously) platonic relationships with my other professors and classmates. I am going to report him and if an update is wanted I’ll give one, thank you for reading and any advice that can be given. ",2,1764883895.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1pecgug,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybrosover30/comments/1pecgug/would_you_make_out_with_your_straight_married_boss/,Would you make out with your straight married boss?,"Sounds cheesy, but my boss [M52] gives me the feeling that he’s clearly hitting on me. I [M42] work in his office; we’re about 8–9 employees. He’s married to a woman and has three kids. The office is directly under his private apartment—he basically can walk there in under ten steps.

We often see his kids passing by the windows after school or his wife leaving in the morning for work. This gives us employees a very familiar vibes in the office. Makes him appears as well super adorable. I’ve been working there for three years now, and I’ve gradually grown in the company. At the beginning I didn’t have much responsibility and mostly did general tasks, but over the last year and a half I’ve taken over two projects. One of them is particularly important, so I have to work closely with my boss.

Today we had to visit a client to close a deal, and we had an hour-long car ride ahead of us. He had just come back from Thailand, where he visited an old German friend who now lives there permanently with his new Thai girlfriend.

I asked him about the trip—we talk pretty openly, and he knows I’m gay. He told me how his friend enjoys life in Thailand, about some spiritual retreat, and also about how they had to go look for the girlfriend after she ran off to drink some sour cocktails at the beach with her Thai girlfriends. Then, out of nowhere, he said he isn’t in love with his wife anymore, or that something has faded away.

I asked some deeper questions—whether an open relationship would be an issue for them, or if they’d ever considered that kind of thing. He said no, and called himself a “boring/conventional person” and emphasised on his romantic character, that he basically can’t hook-up or do one night stand.

Somehow the atmosphere in the car started to feel a bit flirty. I even felt like I could have asked him to kiss.

After the meeting, we went back to the office. He had another meeting, and I had some work to do on my other projects. My desk faces the hallway where the coffee machine is. He walked out of his meeting twice to grab something from the shelves, and both times—while passing my desk—he looked directly into my eyes. A long, sustained look, smiling slightly, without saying anything, then went back to his meeting.

After that he went back to his apartment next door… and I suddenly got horny. I started fantasising about us having sex, imagining ripping his pants off, getting into him … yeah.

I pushed the thoughts away immediately and went back to work. Talked about business stuff with my colleagues, get distracted and focus back on work.

But somehow … in that moment I was kind of super confused. Next time something like this happens I think I might bring it up with him. What do you guys think about this whole situation?

In the car, he said another thing that I think is interesting: he wondered if he felt close to the friend he visited in Thailand, a guy in his 70s. I asked him whether he felt closer to those older guys or to me—since I’m ten years younger. He thought about it for a moment and said he definitely feels closer to me.

This guy might just be a natural people pleaser or a charmer … but those long sustained looked … argh maybe I m far too much sensitive at the moment, coz I m single and this is winter and I desperately need to cuddle.",0,1764883849.0,gaybrosover30,1,0.25,False

1pecg0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/alterbridge/comments/1pecg0m/huge_rambling_session_about_how_excited_i_am_for/,Huge rambling session about how excited I am for AB (And next year to a lesser extent...),"This post kinda just turned into a huge essay's worth of rambling, naturally. It was supposed to be like a paragraph, but the brilliance can't be expressed with only one.

2025 has been a fantastic year for music in my circle. *Tremonti*, *Mammoth*, and *Three Days Grace* kicked ass with their albums (*One Of A Kind is PERFECT.)*, *Shinedown* singles forming great promise for their new album (*Dance, Kid, Dance and Searchlight* are my favorites), *Puscifer* singles (*Self Evident* is a banger), *The Violent* (*Red Sun Rising* guys) Dropped a pretty cool EP *(Sinner Boy* is awesome), *Finger Elev*en dropped a new album after like 10 years which was great, but, on the top of this steep mountain once more is, of course, Alter Bridge.

I know I know, it's probably too early to call. but from hearing bits of *Trust in Me, Disregarded*, *Tested and Able* and a little bit of *Hang by a Thread* from Ola Englund's *coffee with AB* video and, of course, the 3 singles, it seems more and more apparent that these guys obviously have steam left, and quite a lot. YES, I AM this hungry for new AB.

Sadly, there was no *Rue the Day* and *Power Down* I could hear, which just makes me anticipate them even more than I already was.

Ok, new single\*: Playing Aces...\* is great. I said this in AB's comments for the video (They hearted my comment! (: ) *""You can feel the life oozing off each single, and you can tell they gave it their all this time around.""* It's gambling analogy makes a simple song (lyrics wise) on the surface, but reading into it gives way to a beautiful complexity in songwriting that I love to hear. Chorus gave me *Never Say Die* vibes which I loved because *Never Say Die* is awesome, and the solo is just an absolute chef's kiss. I can see it climbing pretty high.

*What Lies Within* has climbed to my #2 AB song, and 3rd favorite song overall. I don't even think it's recency bias anymore, it's just incredible. Is it going to fall from that #3 position? Probably, but to make there as a new single for me is impressive because I usually NEVER would accept a single in my top 10 upon release. This one was it. THE single. This song is the true embodiment of *modern Alter Bridge's best* to me. Glad they named the tour after it because *What Lies Within* is the most *Alter Bridge* to *Alter Bridge* on *Alter Bridge...*

*Silent Divide* is the weakest of the three in my humblest opinion, but definitely paved the way for this album's momentum, being their most successful single in a LONG time (On YouTube at least...) *My Champion* was the most recent single that (currently) has more views than *Silent Divide*. Nearly 10 years ago. Besides that, *Silent Divide* is a super good track, and, in my opinion, it was a good pick for lead single.

*Trust in Me* plays in the interview when the threesome walks into the video room. Sounds good. Not too hyped about it... BUT! Mark is sounding killer. This is what I mean by ""Livelier"". There is a spark here. Something beautiful is still alive and always was there... Anywho, I'm sure when I can actually hear it it's gonna bang, but for now all I can say Mark is sounding real good.

*Disregarded* is next I think and it sounds mean and it makes me PUMPED. pretty menacing, sounds kinda spooky from what i heard. That chorus sounds AWESOME, even if the only word I made out is ""*Disregarded"".* I am HYPED. HYPED. for this song. Think there's still a chance for it to be a single?

T*ested and Able*... Man. That riff did not disappoint. 100% Heaviest AB riff in a while, one of their heaviest for sure. To me it sounds like the love child of *Symphony of Agony* and *Island of Fools*. This song (Idk why) reminds me of *The Last Hero,* which is a great sign (TLH is my favorite song ever after all.) I love the contrast between lyric and instrumental. Not as hyped for it as i am for *Disregarded* but I KNOW it will deliver and then some.

*Hang by a Thread* (the intro at least) Sounds VERY ABII. Like it was born to be amongst that group. I can't say much else because they switched it back to *Tested and Able* and then they're out of that room.

It all sounds so good. Theres over a million English words but NONE could possibly express my excitement and optimism for this new record. They are back in the biggest way they could've possibly been back.

2026 is a year of unrivaled promise. *Alter Bridge* and *Shinedown* will be releasing new records and in between will be *Puscifer's,* like a dessert in between the big meals. Mike Protich (*Red Sun Rising* guy) has been working on a solo record for a bit now and even has somewhat complete songs for it so 2026 could be its year. besides that, more good stuff is bound to be unleashed during the year. I should unfollow the *Paw Patrol* Spotify account so I don't keep getting false hope but I'm not going to.

I've had my eye on a Ricoh GR III and now IV for better part of 2 years. I'd really love to try either the III or the IV and have been looking for a place to rent, but most places have a minimum 6 month rental period.

I thought I'd see if any Aussies know of any Ricoh Meetup groups around Sydney. I'd love to buy someone a coffee and give the camera a quick go, experience the autofocus and overall feel for myself. It's a big investment and I just worry about spending so much on a system that will be a pain to use day to day.

Happy to meet up in a public place e.g. CBD or elsewhere. Maybe possible to get a little group together so all parties feel safe.

Thanks all!

Hi! Im a 23 year old woman, and I worked as a barista from the age of 19, up to a few weeks ago. My only job before that was Mcdonalds, for about a year.  For most of my adult life I've been stuck at the same coffee shop. I always called it my own personal pergatory. Not quite hell (although it was often close). like it was perfectly designed to torture me, specifically, while being just easy enough to love, so that I would not want to leave. And it seemed like no matter what I did, I could never escape the place. You see, my special interest is coffee, and I honestly love taking care of others. But the place was an absolute royal mess. I won't fully go into all the drama of it, because I don't want to subject anyone to a whole series of unfortunate essays. But the important part is the mental strain it caused me as the one and only barista. Sometimes I was even the only employee (we typically had 1 cook). I often ran the place for $13 an hour (plus tips, although I found out recently the original owner was taking half of my tips). It was very difficult to take a break, I had to just hope there would enough dead time for me to eat.  I was expected to have a full and riveting conversation with most customers while paying attention to the entire store with a constant garage of bright lights and loud noises in the background. And the many times I had panic attacks while working, there was no proper back room (just a tiny hallway with some shelves, alittle dish pit, and the 1 bathroom) or even a back door that I could step through to take a quick deep breath. I had so many days where I was so hungry, I thought I was going to pass out, but I had to just work through it. I had to keep moving, because the customers were still coming in, and then I had to close on my own in a decent time so I wouldn't get in trouble for staying on the clock too long. But, I had a lot of freedom there, genuinely I loved the work I did, and I didn't know anything else. Up until recently I was never late, and rarely did I miss days, despite being in a constant state of fight or flight. As we got new owners, just as messy, but with different problems, I started getting to work later and later. A coffee shop should not ever open late. But what can they do, when I'm the only person that knows how to do everything? Every day, it got harder and harder to force myself to get up, to go back there. My boss started lessening my hours, filling in the gaps with her teenagers, and closed days. She hoped that, with some more time off, I'd chill out of this burnout. I was only working 7 (occasionally 8) hours day, 4 days. But it didn't help. I had just enough time to finish recovering before I went back to work the next morning. Then I started calling out, more and more. Until, one Tuesday morning, I woke up on time, and just stared at my ceiling for 3 hours straight, unable to move. I couldn't even make myself call out. And like that I didn't go back. A pussy, and irresponsible way out, I admit. But I am free. 

Luckily for me, my boyfriend finally has a high-paying enough job to take care of us. It will be very tight, I won't be able to get my anti-depressants for a little while, but our house will be fine, and we will have food. I've been interviewing for other jobs, but the job market here is very small, the only available jobs are basically waitress or health aide. And I don't particularly have the skills for either, nor would I want to go back to being overstimulated all the time. I thought I wanted to own a coffee shop for a long time. I thought I could just do all the behind the scenes things, and leave the customers and the loud noises to my employees. But I've learned over the years, that truly, a good boss, the boss I dream of being, is also a good employee, and co worker. A good boss always finds a way to jump in and do the dirty work when need be. I can't handle doing that in a coffee shop for the rest of my life. I am autistic after all. So, I've found a way to almost always do the behind the scenes things that I love so much! Roasting! Under cottage food law here in Florida, I can roast coffee in my house, and sell online across the United states! And of course every once and a while, I'll go to farmers markets and whatnot. I am having so much fun creating, and crunching numbers on my own schedule and terms!  Please, it's very much a work in progress, but I would very much appreciate if you helped support my dreams and autistic freedom!  😁

What really got me started was going to Japan and having some incredible pourovers - such incredibly bright, fruity, flavourful cups that almost seemed like a different drink altogether from what I used to get with my aeropress.

  
I've been using my Baratza Encore & a plastic V60 ever since and have been enjoying my results, although sometimes I struggle to get the most out of my beans. For kettle I'm using a Bonavita gooseneck, and I'm subscribed to Rogue Wave's monthly subscription, so I just get bags of whatever comes in from that. Per above, I like bright, fruity coffees the most. 

So now I'm looking to upgrade my kit.

  
In terms of grinders, based on my research it seemed like a ZP6 was the way to go and so I've been looking at picking one up for some time, as that clarity seems to be something I enjoy, but I worry about its comparatively reduced versatility vs. a K-ultra - this is my main debate in the grinder realm.

  
As far as brewers, I do sometimes find the V60 a little finicky and also I'd just like another option to add to the quiver. I've been looking at adding a Kalita Wave minoyaki or tsubame, OR and Orea V4. The Kalita appeals to me more in terms of simplicity of running, whereas I'm slightly put off by all the extras that you do/don't have to get with an Orea.

  
But, in terms of chasing down bright, clear, fruity flavours, which direction would you suggest I go? I'm aware I haven't optimized some things as well (I haven't gone deep into more expensive beans or optimizing my water, for example).",1,1764883122.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

The first time I opened it I cleared 4 hours and it only felt like an hour, this is a good sign for any video game.

  
I'm about half way through the tutorial missions, and I did one regular mission.

  
Question is this :  I have never bought food for the crew, and I keep hearing that you can do meal planning, etc to ensure a balanced diet.  How do I do this ?

  
Frankly I'd be happy to not even get that deep with it and even buy any food at all at this point.  Nothing in the Galley really helps, and when I ask the warehouse guy what he has, there is never any food up for grabs (except coffee).

  
Is it just too soon in the game ?  I was just able to send my crew out for some R&R, so I should have sufficient sea time to trigger the ability to buy food (if that's even a mechanic).

  
Thanks in advance.

This man is so infuriating, how are you going to say a “silhouette” picture isn’t more sexual. Sure a whole nude is more sexual but a silhouette picture is sexy it leaves it to the imagination. I think it was said at some point that he could tell she had just a bra on. 

Jace having to cover his face to keep himself from lying is giving away that he’s a fucking liar. I know he’s dumb so I know he’s telling the guys every little detail about his affairs so the fact that Jace and Jordan both couldn’t keep a straight face is so telling and I wish one of them would have said “dude just stop”

Don’t blame Taylor for breaking up with you several times when you’re a fucking love bomber, manipulator, and quite frankly emotionally abusive. You’ve put that woman through hell, you know her past you know she’s the type to blow up so you pushing and pushing at her buttons is going to cause her to blow up and then you step back and go “oh she’s crazy” it’s your fault you’re the insane one. 

You should have been working to save your relationship with her instead of trying to get in her “aunts” pants. Sure maybe it wasn’t cheating but she was either pregnant or had freshly given birth when you were SENDING DICK PICS TO HER AUNT. 

Dakota if you’re reading this here’s a script on what you should be saying to Taylor “I’ve been a bad person to you and for that I’m sorry. We bring out the worst in each other and I can only apologize for my behavior and the hurt I’ve caused you. I’m sorry for ruining your family, I’m sorry for trying to fuck your aunt there’s no excuse for what I did.” And say it with your chest not your wimpy ass crying. 

I have no idea how you are as a dad but if you are a good dad then good for you. You can be a good dad and a bad person. You can love and care for your kid, you can love and care for Taylor but you can also treat her like shit. 

You two shouldn’t be together, you two need to co parent and exchange Ever in a public place not at your homes. Both of you need boundaries, honestly a 3rd party should be the one exchanging ever between you two. 

Dakota I hope you can teach ever to treat women with kindness, none of us would be here without women so honestly tell all your little dadtok buddies to respect their women because they’re the ones making you guys dads. 

Lastly Dakota I hope you slightly choke on your saliva on a daily basis, I hope you hit your shin on every coffee table. I hope every time you’re driving the sun is in your eyes and you can’t find your sunglasses. If you don’t have it already I hope you develop seasonal allergies and your local drug store is always out of zertec. I hope every time you stretch in the morning you get a leg cramp or a foot cramp.

1pec21a,https://bayareacurrent.com/barista-rebellion-blue-bottle-workers-walk-off-the-job/,Barista Rebellion: Blue Bottle Workers Walk Off the Job - Bay Area Current,"December 03 2025Share

“Nestlé puts their profits first, give your workers what they’re worth!”

These words rang through Piedmont Avenue on Black Friday morning, after the [Blue Bottle Independent Union](https://www.instagram.com/bbiunion/?ref=bayareacurrent.com) launched its first strike the day before Thanksgiving. One-hundred workers in the East Bay and Boston, MA jointly withheld their labor to pressure Nestlé-owned Blue Bottle Coffee to the bargaining table to negotiate a first union contract. 

“Honk your horn, ring your bell! Nestlé sucks, give them hell!” Picketers took turns on a megaphone, pulling from the classics, as well as improvising their own chants. A crew of Blue Bottle workers and community supporters talked to customers about supporting the strike and encouraged them to get coffee elsewhere.

Management relented and announced they would be closing the store at 1pm. Picketers celebrated the win, and then made plans to transfer the picket line to the Old Oakland store.

This follows workers shutting down the Berkeley, Piedmont and Old Oakland locations successively on November 26, the first day of the strike. [According to the union’s social media,](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRxRLp6gCmp/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D&ref=bayareacurrent.com) workers in Boston were also successful in closing down stores, leading to over $100,000 of lost profit to Blue Bottle over the course of the four day strike. Building the union to this point, however, meant fighting against isolation on the job, and showing up for each other.

“My coworker Ashley got fired on Tuesday” said Max Plotkin, a barista in the Berkeley location at the picket in front of the Old Oakland location. “She was denied union representation. That’s a violation of the [Weingarten Rules](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/weingarten-rights?ref=bayareacurrent.com). She was just fired because of allegations \[of theft\], \[but\] there was no evidence presented.” Since the announcement of the strike on November 23, Blue Bottle has fired three workers: one in East Bay and two in Boston. All were active members of the union, and one fired worker was on the national bargaining team.

>""We get two-thirds of the living wage for here in the East Bay. So it’s very hard to make our bills. And then I can’t get EBT or any kind of assistance because according to the government, I make too much.”

Blue Bottle, which was founded in Oakland in 2002, was acquired by Nestlé in 2017 at a valuation of $700 million. But workers say that profit hasn’t trickled down to them. “Even a year in with the union they still haven’t bargained with us in fair reasoning,” said Doe, a worker who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The union won recognition in May 2024, and has been bargaining with the company since January of this year for their first union contract, an agreement between the workers and a company on how the workplace will run. After trading proposals for several months, the union [claims on its website](https://www.bluebottleunion.org/blog/november-bargaining-update?ref=bayareacurrent.com) that Blue Bottle has yet to give good-faith counter offers on issues like promotions, uniforms, scheduling, or any economic proposals such as wages. Blue Bottle did not respond to a request for comment from *Current*.

“The last time they went to the table,” Doe continued, “they offered us really nothing but a cork board. That’s it. No raise, no incentive, no lower healthcare. A lot of us are paying like $220 a month for healthcare alone. Blue Bottle considers 28 hours full-time. \[So\] we get two-thirds of the living wage for here in the East Bay. So it’s very hard to make our bills. And then I can’t get EBT or any kind of assistance because according to the government, I make too much.”

Conversations about unionization had always been in the background, says barista Alex Reyes, who works in the Berkeley location. Reyes recalls an incident that kickstarted organizing. “We share a building with WeWork upstairs, and they would flush documents down the toilet, they would flush brown paper towels down the toilet, and it caused the system to back up. It was just raining in the back of house. And management says it’s just condensation from the AC units, no big deal, happens all the time. It was brown! Mop and bucket out, collect it, it was brown and stinky! Later in the day we just said we can’t work in these conditions, we’re leaving.” Reyes reported that OSHA shut the store down for two weeks as a result.

Of the workers *Current* interviewed, all emphasized the importance of their relationships with each other, and with the wider labor movement. “People saw that, hey, if that happened to us \[the Berkeley store\] and the response from management was so poor, it could happen to any of the cafes,” Reyes remarked. And so the union has been building itself through genuine relations amongst workers. “Just being authentic with each other, instead of just having fleeting conversations, or just being so closed off while we’re working. It helps really fight alienation.”

Plotkin discussed how the firing of a coworker affected the workers.  “Our manager just tried to act the whole day like it was a normal day. And meanwhile, the rest of us are like, we just lost a team member, we just lost a friend at this location. None of us are that detached from each other, like the way that management is detached from the baristas.”

Plotkin is a former software engineer at NASA, laid off due to the Trump administration’s federal spending cuts, and specifically sought out work at Blue Bottle because it was unionized. “I want to go to work with people who have each other's back. I want to know that people are taking care of each other and being unionized is a great way to make sure that we're taking care of each other, that we're combining our diverse skills and our strength.”

>“A hundred more people are connected in this labor movement. A whole community of people are sharing this experience, learning from each other, supporting each other.”

Workers at the picket line shouted slogans in solidarity with [Starbucks workers, who recently launched a strike effort](https://bayareacurrent.com/antioch-starbucks-workers-fight-back/). Reyes mentioned being inspired by workers unionizing at Starbucks, as well as at [Dandelion Chocolate](https://sf.eater.com/2021/3/25/22350614/dandelion-chocolate-sf-employees-unionizing-pay-safety-concerns?ref=bayareacurrent.com). “This concept of mutual aid that other groups put out there, we see. We appreciate the help with knowledge that other groups, other organizations, other coffee shop workers have. It’s mutual aid and camaraderie,” Reyes said.

In one incident on the picket line, someone briskly rushed into the store while picketers implored them to not enter. Plotkin noted they were a worker crossing the picket line to assist management. Although the union is having to navigate the tensions coming from some workers helping managers keep stores open during the strike, Reyes remains optimistic. “You know, the people who are crossing the picket line, if they’re reading this, know that we are the same union, we are fighting for their rights \[too\].”

For Reyes, this is just one chapter in the longer struggle against Nestlé. “A hundred more people are connected in this labor movement. A whole community of people are sharing this experience, learning from each other, supporting each other.”

When asked what their hopes were beyond the strike, which ended December 1st, workers again emphasized the connections that they had built with their co-workers. “I hope people ahead of me will have the union, and it’ll be strong,” said Doe, “and they’ll have a contract for fair pay for future baristas. We’re the front faces that \[customers\] see when they come into the store. You know, it’s not corporate faces that are up there. It’s *us* that are helping make their bottom-line dollar.”

First off, happy Spotify Wrapped day! Nice to see the love for the band in full effect here.

Next up on the Daily Motörhead Song Discussion is the B-side of the Overkill single, Too Late, Too Late! Too Late, Too Late is on the top of my list of B-sides that I wish was on the album proper, it's great. There's a certain groovy-ness to the song that makes it really stand out in my view. Eddie's riffs in the verses are sharp and catchy as hell and him being lower in register makes the choruses and the guitar solo stand out all the more. Eddie was known for his more bluesy playing but here he shows off how he could evolve his blues style into a song that's heavier while still honoring his influences. The guitar solo in particular shows this off really well; it's faster and heavier than most blues solos but it's still got that characteristic Eddie Clarke bluesy affect to it that's great. The riffing in the choruses takes the verse riff and makes it brighter but not too bright so that the edge of the song isn't diluted. I think this is one of Eddie's more underrated songs guitar-wise. Phil's drum fills in this song are excellent, and this is an example in my opinion of Phil knowing when to pull back from his typical drum wackiness (which I love, don't get me wrong). This song didn't need to go super crazy with the drums and Phil understood that assignment really well here. Some fills I really want to highlight are at 45 seconds and 1:31 in. They're simple, sure but not every drummer would put them in I feel and Phil was always really good at deviating from the norm and being really unique. I love the fills in the solo as well, they really make the solo pop even more. Phil's really light on the cymbals comparatively in this song (at least to my ears) and that makes this song stand out all the more. Lemmy's bass gives this song the body and depth and compliments Eddie's guitar brilliantly. 

Too Late, Too Late is a song all about how a relationship is at its end as one person's finally come to the realization that they've been played. Lemmy's done a fair few breakup songs and this one is one of my favorites because it sounds like one person in this relationship is *exhausted*. From Lemmy's description, it sounds like the other person in this relationship was used and hit their breaking point. ""I see that nothing's changed, insist on playing games / Some waste of time you are, and you're so popular"", I've always found the ""and you're so popular"" lyric interesting in this song, it's like the person doing the manipulating and game playing has been backed up by a group of friends and that popularity sort of blinded the other person in this couple. Verse two is just a brutal takedown of the manipulator of this relationship and the start of the other person in this relationship finally starting to the reality of their situation. ""I thought you were for real, just one more rip-off deal"" is I think an excellent summation of people that finally wake up, smell the coffee and realize that the relationship they're in isn't doing them any good and that they need to end it, especially with people that manipulate and toy with you. ""Your credibility don't cut no ice with me / You're just a feeble con, I know what's going on"" I love that Lemmy chose the word feeble here. The person in this relationship has realized that the hold the other person had on them was actually quite tenuous at best and how their lies ultimately crumble in on themselves. Lemmy's range of songwriting when it comes to breakup songs is fantastic, compare this to something like Too Good to Be True and Down the Line off of March ör Die and Hammered respectively. Great song, this was played on and off over the years and memorably Lemmy played this song with Metallica in 2009 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jaS6e8x5YQ).

One Breath Prayer: You’re Not Alone
===================================

Have you ever felt the weight of the world on your shoulders, wrestling with feelings of isolation, or wondering if anyone truly understands your struggles? You’re not alone. In this fast-paced life, it’s easy to forget that we have a constant companion ready to shoulder our burdens—the gift of prayer. The concept of “One Breath Prayer” allows us to connect with God in the simplest of ways, reminding us that we are never truly alone.

The Power of a Simple Prayer
----------------------------

A One Breath Prayer can be just a few words—simple yet powerful. These prayers remind us that communication with God doesn’t have to be elaborate; it can be as straightforward as simply declaring, “Help me, Lord,” or “I trust You.”

When you feel overwhelmed, reciting a One Breath Prayer can be a quick way to recalibrate your spirit. The beauty lies in the simplicity.

- **“Lord, guide my steps.”**
- **“I surrender this to You.”**
- **“Thank You for Your presence.”**

Each moment you pause for a One Breath Prayer, you invite divine guidance and comfort into your day.

Biblical Foundations of Our Connection
--------------------------------------

Throughout Scripture, we see countless instances where God reassures us of His unwavering presence. One of my favorite passages is found in Joshua 1:9:

> “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”

This promise urges us to lean into our relationship with God, reminding us that no matter the challenges we face, we do not walk this journey alone.

Reflecting on Our Isolation
---------------------------

Even in our spiritual walk, it’s easy to feel isolated. We may wonder if others share our burdens or if anyone else feels the way we do. Reflect on these questions:

1. Have you felt alone in your struggles recently?
2. What are some prayers you’ve been holding onto that you can share with God in a single breath?
3. How does knowing that God is with you affect your perspective on daily challenges?

Take a moment to write down your thoughts. Sharing our vulnerabilities can create a sense of community and connection.

Inviting God Into Our Daily Lives
---------------------------------

Imagine transforming mundane moments into powerful connections with God. Whether you’re waiting in line, commuting to work, or sipping your morning coffee, take a moment for a One Breath Prayer.

Here’s how you can incorporate this into your routine:

1. **Morning Routine:** Start your day with a simple, heart-felt prayer like “Lord, I’m trusting You today.”
2. **Midday Moment:** If you feel overwhelmed, step outside and say, “Thank You for Your presence, Lord.”
3. **Evening Reflection:** Wind down with, “Help me learn from today.”

These tiny pauses in your day can form a consistent rhythm of faith, reinforcing that you are never alone.

A Community of Believers
------------------------

One Breath Prayers can also serve as a gateway to a larger conversation within your community. Engage with fellow believers by sharing your experiences or your favorite breath prayers. Discuss how prayer has made a difference in your lives.

Invite them to join you in creating a collection of One Breath Prayers that resonate with your group. The beauty of community lies in the collective strength we gain from supporting one another.

Embrace the Connection
----------------------

In the end, prayer is not merely a ritual; it’s a relationship—a living connection to God that reminds us of His presence in every moment of our lives. A One Breath Prayer empowers us to acknowledge that we are not alone.

As you journey through life, think of how you can integrate these quick prayers into your routine. Allow them to remind you of the constant presence of God, ready to provide comfort, wisdom, and companionship.

Your Turn!

I don’t really know how to start this except to say: I feel incredibly stuck in my marriage, and I hate the life I’m living right now.
Before marriage, I was a very bright, independent, adventurous woman. I’m a seasoned programmer with a good career, and I used to fill my life with hobbies—free diving, mountaineering, badminton, solo coffee shop dates, long walks, running errands alone, everything. I had a solid support system too: friends who were basically family. I was a godmother to their kids, I knew their spouses, and they understood me more than anyone. I miss them so much.
But everything changed when I got married (we don’t have kids yet).
At first, things with my husband were blissful. But early on, he made it clear he didn’t like my friends. I slowly drifted away from them for his comfort. Over time, I noticed myself changing too. He’d get angry if I talked to my friends without telling him. He said they “disrespected” him. His anger was intense—I could see the hate in his eyes, like he was ready to hit me. I wanted to walk away back then, but he always pulled me back, recovered the situation, and wouldn’t let me detach. And I was also ashamed—we were already engaged, I’d met his family. So I stayed.
Fast forward to now: I work from home, and he gets jealous over everything. Even if our neighbor talks to me, he gets mad. If I go out for a walk, he accuses me of sleeping with someone. It’s like he sees me as someone he picked up from a bar, not his wife. Whenever we fight, he just resets like nothing happened. He has moments where he tries to change, but I’m already too scared to do the things I love.
What hurts is the imbalance. He can go out and drink with his friends (and I let him, because I believe in freedom). But I can’t even step outside for fresh air or exercise without being interrogated. I’m becoming unhealthy, mentally and physically.
I know I should walk away. But we’re in the Philippines, and I can’t handle the shame or judgment that comes with separation. Please don’t tell me to leave him. I’m not planning to—not right now. I just want to hear from women who learned to live with a very controlling husband. How do you cope? How do you still carve out small freedoms or “play around” the situation?

My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

From Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, the US, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland, each country has its own unique coffee culture and brewing style.

Today I tried a new espresso method, and it made me wonder:

👉 How do YOU prefer your daily coffee?

Espresso — strong & bold

Latte — smooth & creamy

Pour-over — clean & balanced

Cold Brew — refreshing & sweet

Cappuccino — foamy perfection

Or maybe a special traditional style from your country?

1pebodf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1pebodf/my_friend_got_slapped_and_i_couldnt_do_anything/,My friend got slapped 😭😭😭 and I couldn't do anything.,"So basically I have 2 friends I hang out with let's call them kit and kat. we decided to go to a coffee shop at somewhere around 8pm. Now kat is a christian and he had to go attend his prayer so only me and kit went. He was on his scooty and I was on mine now. We had to Cross a circle which had 3 roads connected to it. We had to go straight and not turn on the circle.

And i went ahead of my frnds scooty like 50 meters ahead and I hear a crashing sound I looked in my side mirrors and saw that some guy ran his bike into my friend's scooty. That man was clearly at fault cuz he literally rammed his bike into the side of my friends scooter. He was standing on some stall and wanted to cross the road and some how ended up ramming into kit. I didn't saw exactly how the accident happened but by the position of the vehicles one could clearly tell who was at fault.


It wasn't a big crash and none of them fell from theirs respective vehicles kit got a lil imbalanced cuz he was hit on the side but he managed somehow. I saw all this and thought to myself maybe they will argue a lil exchange few galis and sort it out cuz it wasnt tht big of a crash. But to my suprise as soon as kit looked at the uncle after managing not to fall from his scooter , the Uncle slapped him. His specs went flying across the road. He got slapped int he middle of the road and middle of the circle for no reason.I saw that and went to them immediately and started shouting at the uncle and there was a jam and lots of spectators this went for about 10 mins and few of the uncles Friends came to back him off. The vendors and other passerby came and try to control the situation which they did and we left for the coffee ☕.

One of the guy who saw all this followed us and told us how what the guy did was wrong and blah blah that we should focus on our study and forget about what happened, but i couldn't stop thinking about that since. What bothers me is that when I came to the scene my friend was so helpless and on verge of crying he is literally so innocent and I was so shameful for not hitting the guy back. My friend was really scared and i was the only one arguing with that fatty none of the spectators backed me up. Now after the coffee I went back to the vendors and tried asking for the guys name (I live in a small town so we'll find him soon) welll no luck then i went to kat and told him everything he told his father and we went to a few shops to find out who that guy was. I know i blundered i should have taken his photo or atleast noted his number plate but I was scared. I called my mom told her everything she called some politician uncle and he came and he asked for cctvs footages. I hope we find that guy soon...


But the point is i couldn't even defend my friend I feel so guilty 😭😭 and I keep remembering how my friend looked he was so helpless like who is gonna help him. His family condition is not that good so he knew there was none he can call for help. he didn't even tell his family about all this. All he does is study he went out with me after soo long after I forced him to cuz am leaving for a family function soon. I hate myself for not hitting that man. All I did was shouting I should have atleast clicked a picture. I don't wanna blame my friend cuz I didn't expect him to fight or even defend himself ik how pathetic this sounds but he genuinely looked terrified of what just happened. he was on verge of crying. He wasnt even saying anything at the scene I was pretty much the only one arguing.

Summary:- some uncle rammed into my friend scooty and slapped him and i couldn't do anything about it but argue.

Don't mind my bad english am pretty sure we will find that guy I'll probably delete this post soon.

Pls tell me what could I have done and what could my friend (kit) had done..

thanks to my mom for helping me out this much and thanks to the politician uncle he came to help us in the middle of the night.

Props to the guy who followed us to the coffee shop and helped us out.

Thank you

Whether it's a morning coffee prepared just so before you turn the lights on, or a monthly dinner with the family, or a yearly holiday; these rituals both bring and reminds us of the value and joy in our very finite lives. My mom doesn't get ""pretty"" or ""seasonal"" or decorating. My mom sees only obligation and a disruption to her daily schedule, and more than that, obligations she'd like to get out of. 

Growing up my mom helped us celebrate the essential Christian holidays; Easter, 4th of July, and Christmas. She'd decorate a little, get us gifts, and cook a meal. We rarely, if ever, celebrated holidays with other people, and it was never a big affair. She often took ""lessons"" from someone going wrong, though the lesson was invariably ""never ever do \_that thing\_ again."" I recall her enjoying my dad driving us around nice neighborhoods to see the lights, but she never really wanted to put them up in our house. Easter was just Church and the egg hunt at church and an Easter basket. 4th of July was maybe a picnic at a park venue and then fireworks at home. And birthdays only happened on years that we moved, so classmates could know who we were. My youngest sister moved out 15 years ago and since my other sibling is no contact, she does almost nothing now. A Christmas tree with childhood ornaments decorated on Christmas Eve and a single nativity in the window. If we come over and food has been prepared or decorations laid out it was my dad. If she comes to my house, I don't think she does anything.

1pebeo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/comments/1pebeo9/art_type_spotlight_diorama/,Art Type Spotlight - Diorama,"Dioramas are 3D representations of a scene, often in miniature. This is an extremely broad category with a lot of great options. Dioramas can be as large or small as you like - refrigerator boxes or matchboxes. They can be freeform without any walls/backdrops or contained in resin. They can be detailed and to scale or simplistic and abstract. You can build within existing structures - shoeboxes or cassette cases - or build your own container/base. You can use existing materials like Lego bricks or make your own from scratch. They can be functional - lamps, clocks, etc. - or purely decorative, like bookshelf-insert book nooks. They can even be edible if you construct them with a cake or cookie base. You can also make digital dioramas with modelling software like Blender or Tinkercad.

**Potential ways to connect to a fic:** 

You can recreate your favorite scenes or notable settings, or get a little abstract and do an overall representation of a fic. Include quotes you liked, symbols, writers’ unique interpretations of the characters, etc. Reading a cute coffee shop AU? Time to make a little coffee shop complete with mini coffee cups and the tiniest donuts this world has ever seen. Found a thriller with an intense action scene? Drag your toy army men out of storage and give ‘em a makeover to recreate it!

**Examples:**

You’re probably familiar with the [basic shoebox diorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DJKyM3JIAI), but that’s by no means the end of what’s possible. You can go super tiny, like this [matchbox kitchen](https://www.instructables.com/Miniature-Matchbox-Kitchen/), or escape the confines of the box with these [mini photo cut-out dioramas](https://projectkid.com/make-diy-mini-photo-dioramas/) or freestanding scenes like this [cute halloween diorama](https://www.instructables.com/Small-Clay-Halloween-Diorama-Decoration/). 

For some fandom-specific examples, check out Vlada Rybak’s [incredible recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDO1rk3vqdA) of the Byers’ living room from Stranger Things, and Rachel Maksy’s adorable Over the Garden Wall-themed [book nook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X0ogPbarmc). 

You can make functional dioramas like this [UFO lamp](https://www.instructables.com/Flying-Saucer-Lamp-10/), elaborate encased resin dioramas like this [underground lake diorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6TUejejdVg), or edible dioramas like [this recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeRCfuzEvws) of a scene featuring the giant spider Shelob from Lord of the Rings.

These are just a start, the possibilities are pretty much endless!

**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**

A very thorough beginner’s guide for detailed miniatures can be found here on [everythingverysmall](https://everythingverysmall.com/beginner-diorama-ideas-using-foam-wood-and-everyday-materials/). The site overall is a great resource for making traditional dioramas and miniatures. The connected Youtube channel is also fantastic and features tutorials for a range of skill levels with clear visual instruction, including an entire playlist of videos on making [miniatures from popsicle sticks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmTLa579Qqe6ot7CCerjizxMQlesozRQk). 

Another fantastic Youtube channel for visual learners is [Queen City Minis](https://www.youtube.com/@queencityminis), which features a wide range of videos on making dioramas and miniatures from everyday materials - I particularly love her video on making [realistic mini jars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEi3YOpR0V4) from a variety of very basic materials (such as pencils, buttons, and hot glue sticks), and this video on making [mini mugs out of paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_XXnnTshcg).

For a wide range of tutorials, examples, and expert help, check out [r/dioramas](https://www.reddit.com/r/dioramas/) over on reddit. Their sister subreddit [r/booknooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/booknooks/) offers the same but specifically for bookshelf-insert dioramas.

As with any craft project, [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed project tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse by category to get some ideas.

For digital dioramas done with 3D modelling, check out this [overview](https://www.renderhub.com/blog/miniature-worlds-monumental-impact-the-rise-of-3d-digital-dioramas) on renderhub and [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Design-a-Digital-Diorama-Using-Tinkercad/) for a basic digital diorama using Tinkercad.

For more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent books written about diorama and miniature-making that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities offer additional resources such as 3D printing or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent tools and crafting equipment.

If you find any tutorials or guides helpful when making art for the event, please show the creator some love and leave a comment!

**What to avoid:** 

Be very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial will usually be longer, include lists of materials and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.

**Additional notes:** 

Be sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on materials such as glue, resin, and paints. Use recommended protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses. Work in a well-ventilated area and don’t use hazardous materials in ways not recommended on the packaging. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help!

1pebd1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pebd1r/my_27m_wife_27f_opened_our_marriage_to_explore/,"My (27M) wife (27F) opened our marriage to ‘explore’… until she saw another woman treat me better. Now she wants to close it. I want out, advice?","My name is Tyler, and I’m living in the ruins of the marriage I once thought was unbreakable.
Hannah and I met seven years ago in college. We were that couple everyone envied study dates that turned into all-night conversations, holding hands in the library, planning our future like it was written in the stars. She used to look at me like I was her whole world. I married her because I truly believed we were soulmates. But somewhere along the way, she changed. Or maybe she revealed who she’d always been. 

Four years into our marriage, Hannah fell in with a new friend group, the “experiment, explore, you only live once” type. Overnight she went from the woman who used to curl into my chest at night to someone who looked at me like I was holding her back. Then came the comments. The questions. The cracks in the foundation. “Did we get married too young?” “Sometimes I feel like I rushed into adulthood.” “I don’t want to regret not experiencing things.” “What if we… opened the marriage? Just for fun?”

Each sentence felt like a small dagger. I told her no, repeatedly, desperately. But “no” wasn’t enough for her. The pressure kept building. It was like trying to hold back the tide with bare hands. Eventually, I broke. I agreed. I still hate myself for that. The night she went out with her first “date,” I sat on the edge of our bed staring at my wedding ring like it was mocking me. Every vibration of her phone, every hour she didn’t come home it felt like my chest was being crushed. I stopped sleeping. I drank to numb the panic. I stopped recognizing the man in the mirror.
And she didn’t notice. Or she didn’t care.

It was my best friend, Jason, the guy who’s known me since we were six, who finally snapped me out of the downward spiral. He found me drunk on a Wednesday night and said, “Man, if she’s out there living her life, why are you killing yourself? Go live yours.”
Something inside me shifted. I started going to the gym again. Started eating real meals. Started dressing like I wasn’t invisible. People noticed. Women noticed. I felt alive in a way I hadn’t in years. And that’s when I met Sarah (22F). She works at a little café near my office. She smiled at me like I mattered. She laughed at my jokes. She remembered my coffee order. We talked for weeks, and every conversation made me feel lighter, seen, human.

Eventually, we exchanged numbers. I told Hannah I was seeing someone, and she pretended to be supportive. But behind the smile, something in her eyes flickered. Possessiveness. Jealousy. Panic. Suddenly she wanted updates. Details. She questioned where I was going, when I’d be back, who I was with. It felt like I wasn’t her husband anymore I was her property. But Sarah… God. Being with her felt like coming up for air after drowning for months. She was soft where Hannah was sharp. Curious where Hannah was dismissive. With Sarah, I felt wanted.

Then everything exploded. A few nights ago, I was at Sarah’s apartment. We were in the middle of an intimate moment when we heard a knock at the door loud, insistent, almost desperate. I opened it. It was Hannah. Her eyes were wild, like a storm barely contained. I still don’t know if she tracked me, followed me, or just snapped. She shoved past me into the apartment, screaming that I was betraying her, that “this wasn’t what she meant,” that we were supposed to be “having fun on the side, NOT replacing each other.” I reminded her she never set rules. She didn’t care. She wanted control not clarity. I told her to leave. She eventually did, but Sarah was shaken. I was shaking. I held her and apologized over and over. When I finally got home at 1 a.m., Hannah was sitting in the dark like a ghost.
She told me she wants to close the marriage. That she “misses us.” That she can’t handle the thought of me with someone else.

I told her no. And for the first time, she saw it, really saw it, that I was done being her backup plan. She screamed, crying, asking when I stopped being passionate with her. And I told her the truth. When I was drinking myself to sleep because she was out with other men and she didn’t give a damn. I told her she doesn’t get to shut the door now that it’s finally her turn to feel the consequences.

She stormed off, slammed the bedroom door, and we haven’t spoken since. And here’s the coldest part. I’m not heartbroken anymore. I’m relieved. Peaceful. Done. I don’t love my wife. I don’t recognize her. And I want out.

How do I start the divorce process? No kids. Shared lease. Some joint finances. I don’t know if I should move out, talk to a lawyer, file paperwork I just know I need to end this and rebuild my life before I lose myself again.
Any advice?

Go check brother out for em drop posts

you will need:

•	⁠codeine phosphate tablets, 30mg or even better 60mg (you can also use lower mg if you have to, 30mg or 60mg is best though) •	⁠25mg promethazine tablets •	⁠monin watermelon syrup (you will not taste any watermelon in the final product) •	⁠karo syrup for thickness •	⁠water, i use bottled water because the tap water where i live is fucking gnarly •	⁠vodka •	⁠colouring. you will need red 33, blue 1 and yellow 6 (hi tech only). you will need a milligram scale and 5ml syringes for colour formulation •	⁠flavouring. concentrated flavour drops work best •	⁠coffee filters •	⁠a freezer •	⁠a few hours of your life

the below recipes are for 5oz/150ml, which after accounting for 20% loss from cwe is 67mg codeine/36mg promethazine per oz/30ml. i usually only use 6 25mg promethazine pills to make it 25mg per oz/30ml as i feel the promethazine content in pharma syrup is too high, but if you want 1:1 you gotta use 9.

but first, let me outline the colour formulations ⬇️

red: mix 100mg red 33 with 5ml water and store it in a syringe (so you can easily put drops in your syrup)

blue: mix 20mg blue 1 with 5ml water and store it in a syringe

yellow: mix 100mg yellow 6 with 5ml water and store in a syringe

now that that’s out of the way, step by step/recipes below ⬇️

step 1: crush 14 30mg codeine tablets or 7 60mg codeine tablets + 9 25mg promethazine tablets and put them in 35ml water. leave it for an hour or so swirling it around every so often until everything is dissolved and the solution looks like milk. if your pills have coating on them, make sure to remove it by wiping each pill with a damp paper towel before doing this step

step 2: put the pill water in the freezer for 20 minutes

step 3: make 2 coffee filters wet and put them over a glass. once you’re confident the filters are done dripping, discard of the water in the glass. then slowly pour the pill water through the filters into the glass and wait for it to run through. it’s gonna take a bit of time. depending on what pills you use and how cold the solution is, you can lightly squeeze the filter towards the end to get the last few drops

step 4: when you are done filtering, pour the water in a baby bottle or another container with measurement lines. you should still have 35ml as you don’t lose any water with these kinds of pills. the ratios of monin, karo, vodka, dye and flavouring depend on what you want to rep. mix well after adding each ingredient.

for tris i use:

50ml monin, 45ml karo and 20ml vodka. 5 drops red and 2 drops blue. peach and mint or menthol flavouring to taste

for wock i use:

30ml monin, 65ml karo and 20ml vodka. 2 drops red and 1 drop blue. bubblegum and raspberry flavouring to taste

for tech i use:

25ml monin, 70ml karo and 20ml vodka. 6 drops red, 4 drops blue and 8 drops yellow. boysenberry flavouring to taste

step 5: store the syrup in the fridge for 24 hours before use for a proper drop and enjoy when you feel like it

and that’s that. much love gang 🙏 stay safe y’all",1,1764881294.0,HomebrewHub,0,1.0,False

Recipe took from they drank sub go show love if u haven’t. 

My homebrew recipe (explained) for 1L

First learn cold water extraction on youtube.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=IESnvL564VQ&list=WL&index=10&t=1s

-Read the whole recipe before messaging me and ask me concrete questions.

-I use dihydrocodeine 30mg and 50 mg promethazine pills (or diphenhydramine)

-Cold water extract 2000mg of dihydrocodeine (or codeine) and 1000mg promethazine (or diphenhydramine) with 160 ml warm water (all at once). You will lose roughly 20% doing so (i will not consider the loss to make it more simple)

-Mix with 770 ml of either torani, monin, humco, crown, karo or homemade simple syrup ( l used 500ml of strawberry torani syrup and 270ml crown corn syrup for thickness)

-Add 7% of global 94, (or equivalent brand) which is 70 ml. If you don't have access to it, use vodka.

-Mix your cold water extraction with the syrup and alcohol.

-Opioid equivalent dose approximately : Codeine
200mg = Morphine 30mg = Hydromorphone 6mg
Oxycodone 20mg

Few other tips based on recurrent questions i get:
-Codeine or dihydrocodeine 60mg per ounce
-Morphine 15mg per ounce
-Hydrocodone 10mg per ounce
-Oxycodone 7mg per ounce
-Hydromorphone 2mg per ounce

-For extended release pills you can try crushing them, dissolving them in alcohol and then extract with coffee filters to get rid of fillers. You can leave it in alcohol for a few days to make sure you get the most out of it. Obviously the best way to go is instant release pills. Blending the pills in alcohol also works really great if it does not dissolve on it's own.

-If you want to make your own simple syrup there are more steps to it that i won't include here. The reasons why i use brand name syrups are because i don't have to worry about the preservatives and they work just fine to me as i am not trying to replicate anything.

-I do not sell anything ! This is a hobby and i'm just trying to teach people on how to do this in the simplest way possible.

-It is to your discretion to change colour, strength, consistency, opioid and quantity of antihistamine used etc.

-Antihistamine worth using also is chlorpheniramine.

-Antihistamines (prevents nausea and itchiness) and alcohol are not a necessity but i suggest you use v them.

-Antihistamines (prevents nausea and itchiness) and alcohol are not a necessity but i suggest you use them.

-If you want a ligh purple, use a clear canne sugar syrup (monin, torani or sugar water homemade). As there has no colour added, use a light blue food dye mixed with pink food dye. Play with colours until you have it right there is no secret to the right colouring.

-Yes you need to cwe pills that don't even contain paracetamol (acetaminophen). If you dont cwe, your syrup will be horribly cloudy because of the fillers.

-The amount of water you use for your cold water extract is up to you. It's going to affect the consistency of the syrup. Also note that the less water you use the more codeine you lose so take all that into consideration.

-This is for fun so have fun with it. You fail one batch, do another one until you get it right. That's how i learned: trial and error and i probably saved you a lot of time and money with this recipe!

-Let's make home-brew syrup a safe way to sip lean by understanding how it's made, CHEERS!

I’d start, feel good for two days, then stop.
Not because I was lazy.
I was relying on motivation, and motivation doesn’t last.

The thing that finally worked:

1. Connect the habit to something you already do
After brushing my teeth I journal for 2 minutes.
After making my morning coffee I read one page.

2. Put reminders where you can’t ignore them
Notebook near the toothbrush.
Sticky note on the mirror.
Pen on the pillow.
My environment reminded me, not my memory.

3. Keep the habit tiny
2 minutes only.
Small enough that I don’t resist it.

4. Make the setup obvious
Everything placed in front of me so I don’t think or prepare.

5. Let your daily routine carry the habit
When it’s attached to something automatic, it stops falling apart.

This didn’t change everything instantly,
but after a week the habit finally stayed consistent.

in particular i had a penchant for abandoned honeymoon resorts. the kind of places where the air smells like mildew and forgotten memories.

whether you call it a hobby, obsession, or trespassing, i call it work, or as other people call it, urban exploration. i’m a photographer, and while i don’t mean to brag, i have to say i’m a pretty good one too. photographing these places that have decayed past their prime and posting them online with factoids about their history has gotten me pretty far.

last weekend i went to the pocono mountains in pennsylvania. more specifically, to the old penn hills resort. my parents honeymooned there in the early ’70s, and i’ve only seen it in their faded polaroids: a mirrored lobby that reflected ceiling chandeliers from every angle, heart-shaped tubs in every suite, a wedding-bell-shaped pool outside.

i’d never asked them much about it. nostalgia wasn’t their language. but it was mine, so i packed up my gear and headed out to scout my next project.

only a few short years later it was already being swallowed by the forest. windows boarded up, vines crawling over the brickwork like anxious fingers. according to local rumor — the kind you hear from gas station clerks who never leave town and locals who grew up around the area — the place had shut down after a mysterious string of incidents: guests disappearing, staff quitting in droves, and a series of accidents in the pool area that no one wanted to talk about. 
i didn’t believe in curses or ghosts. 
i believed in wood rot and mismanagement.

it was dipping into late afternoon by the time i headed out the door, so i knew i’d get some golden hour lighting if i didn’t hit traffic.
driving down to the poconos, it’s easy to see why it’s been a honeymoon destination for decades. it feels like you’re driving right into a storybook. wild deer and small brooks are all accoutrements to the mountainous dreamscape that makes you feel like you’re in another time, stuck in the sweet spot of americana glory people always talk about.

i parked my aging rav4 on a side road and walked along the sprawling display of weeds and overgrowth until i found the remnants of pavement cracked and weathered.

“well, here it is,” i thought to myself as i approached the vine-engulfed structure.

the main building was nearly destroyed with most of it falling in on itself but still traversable. the surrounding buildings like the ice rink, suites, and rec center were in mostly good shape. i thought i’d photograph some heart-shaped tubs, maybe a champagne tower, and some vintage signage.

walking inside the first set of suites, the smell hit me first. wet pine needles, rotting carpet, mildew, and something faintly metallic. i cracked a grin. classic abandoned building perfume. i should’ve known better than to be alone, but i had my camera gear, my flashlight, a switchblade, and a pair of gloves — the basic uniform of someone who pretends he’s prepared for anything.

the mirrored ceiling reflected everything, but it was cloudy with dust so the reflections were warbly. the carpet had turned a grim shade of brown instead of its original rich crimson.
i thought to myself, “the last people to care left two decades ago.”
i explored the first few suites slowly, looking for forgotten treasures and peeking out the windows at the endless forest outside.
room numbers were painted in curling gold script on each door. 101. 102. 103. some locked, most warped. i finally found 107 — the suite my parents had stayed in. the door hung slightly ajar. that wasn’t odd. vagrants, other urbexers, and bored local kids were notorious for doing what i was doing, some even overstaying their welcome or trashing the place.
the bed frame was intact though the mattress sagged like it had given up. the heart-shaped tub still gleamed faintly under the grime. i crouched and photographed everything, narrating to myself like i was giving a tour.
“notice the peeling wallpaper, faint scorch marks on the carpet. architectural optimism meets entropy.”
i chuckled at my own jokes, trying to calm the rising awareness that this place was too quiet. penn hills had a different air to it.

then i heard it. 
a faint thump, like someone closing a box upstairs. 
i froze, flashlight sweeping the room, heart tightening. my first thought: animals. raccoon. squirrel. maybe even a raccoon-sized squirrel. my second thought: human. that’s when the wit in my head started muttering warnings — classic horror tropes i’d read so many times.
“don’t investigate alone. don’t split up. don’t open closed doors.”

in that moment i realized clichés are only clichés because they have been experienced so many times and are rooted in truth.

the stairwell reeked of mildew and dust, and every step made the old wood groan. as i moved to what i thought was the second set of suites next door, i noticed the corridor of doors. most were closed. a couple had broken locks and gaping holes. then i saw it: an office door with “staff only” carved faintly in peeling paint. these were rooms used for meetings and offices, probably from when penn hills tried to turn into a conference center when the honeymoon business was going belly up in the late ’90s.

the thumping was coming from there. i approached slowly, flashlight shaking slightly. i peeked through a crack.
the room was small. desks, filing cabinets, yellowed papers scattered everywhere.
in the corner, a man crouched over a desk, moving methodically through piles of paperwork. he was wearing a janitor’s uniform.
his hair was stuck to his head like a bird that had just hatched from an egg. his body was thin and his limbs long.
he looked like he belonged to the hotel’s first crew. he didn’t look up. he didn’t even seem aware i existed.
then i noticed what he was holding: a stack of polaroids. pictures of me entering the building. me exploring the lobby. me looking cluelessly around the first set of suites. unaware i was being watched.

i froze.

he murmured numbers, counting them like money, calculating something i wasn’t meant to understand.
i stepped back.
my flashlight slipped.
a metallic clang.
he turned his head slowly. eyes white around dark pupils. his lips stretched into something like a smile revealing greying gums and yellow teeth, sending a chill down my neck.
“i’ve been waiting,” he said.
not malicious. matter-of-fact.

i ran.

down the stairs, through the lobby, across the overgrown driveway.
i didn’t stop until my car was in sight, doors locked, engine roaring. my hands shook, adrenaline buzzing with every heartbeat.
back home, i replayed everything in my head. i wanted a rational explanation. maybe a security guard who never left and had a sick sense of humor.
but the photos were too many for someone just trying to catch me trespassing.
and if that’s all he wanted, why didn’t he call the police?
i didn’t sleep that night. i couldn’t stop thinking about being watched and knowing he could’ve gotten to me if he wanted to. what was his intention?
after all, he was just a man. patient. methodical. utterly unshaken by the moral weight of what he was doing.
i called my parents the next day.
the hotel? they remembered it as charming, idyllic, a blur of champagne and laughter. they remembered the staff as friendly and helpful. they remembered nothing unusual.
i didn’t tell them about the man or the pictures or the way he had been waiting.
as the days went on, i couldn’t shake the feeling i was still being watched. at night when i was lying in bed or brushing my teeth at the bathroom sink, i’d feel the gaze of the unknown stranger somewhere behind me.
it was the strange feeling you get when you know someone is staring at you without turning around.
i dismissed it as paranoia. eventually life went back to normal, and i almost forgot about the whole ordeal.
almost.

weeks later i got a letter. brown envelope. no return address. no address on the front at all, like someone placed it directly into my mailbox.
inside: a polaroid of me standing in my apartment kitchen, looking down at a cup of coffee.

from what i understand, penn hills isn’t haunted. there’s no ghost waiting for you in the heart-shaped tub. there’s a man. patient. observant. careful. waiting for the right moment to catch you off guard.
i don’t know what he wants or how long he’s been there.

but i do know this…every abandoned place i’ve explored, every cracked floorboard i thought i was safe on, every wry comment i made about horror tropes,
it was all irrelevant when face to face with a terrifying encounter like this. 
it doesn’t need to be supernatural to be horrifying.
he’s just sitting in there, or maybe somewhere else, taking photographs.

I’d start, feel good for two days, then stop.
Not because I was lazy.
I was relying on motivation, and motivation doesn’t last.

The thing that finally worked:

1. Connect the habit to something you already do
After brushing my teeth I journal for 2 minutes.
After making my morning coffee I read one page.

2. Put reminders where you can’t ignore them
Notebook near the toothbrush.
Sticky note on the mirror.
Pen on the pillow.
My environment reminded me, not my memory.

3. Keep the habit tiny
2 minutes only.
Small enough that I don’t resist it.

4. Make the setup obvious
Everything placed in front of me so I don’t think or prepare.

5. Let your daily routine carry the habit
When it’s attached to something automatic, it stops falling apart.

This didn’t change everything instantly,
but after a week the habit finally stayed consistent.

1peb2yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1peb2yw/am_i_spoiled/,Am i spoiled?,"I realize most people probably aren’t treated this way by their parents. I’m 15f, and my dad has always kind of babied me. He grew up poor in Mexico, came to the US with my mom before I was born, and went through a lot. We stayed pretty broke until I was about 4. Anyway, even now, my dad pretty much gets me anything. He has a really hard time saying no. If I want to eat out, he’ll always agree. If I want something pricey for Christmas or my birthday, he’ll buy it. I asked for a treadmill for Christmas and he just got it.

He won’t let me get a part-time job because he insists he’ll handle anything I need, and honestly, he does. Like a month ago, he literally handed me a credit card with something like a 100k limit and told me I could use it however I wanted. He doesn’t check what I buy or question me at all. I mostly just use it here and there for coffee, a pastry, or something from the gas station. A couple of days ago, I went to school and he asked if I bought something from the cafeteria beforehand. I said no because I’d already eaten at home, and he seemed surprised that I didn’t use the card. I swear he wants me to spend money lol.

Does that make me spoiled? I never thought of myself as rich—more like upper-middle class—but when I hear kids my age talk about “saving up” for something, like a bike or a console, I’m like… you save up?

1peb2ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/ismailis/comments/1peb2ab/my_experience_in_the_multifaith_gathering_in/,My experience in the multifaith gathering in Lisbon was a disaster,"My experience at the multifaith gathering in Lisbon was a disaster.

We came in early at 9:30am and went through security in the garage to keep things clean upstairs. Upon coming in we were greated with breakfast and different colors of bracelets that represented our coffee tables. We were around 300. Around 10am we gathered in another room to find our table and meet people from our table. We were told to stay within the boundaries of our tables to make sure that Hazir Imam could circulate between the tables. The atmosphere was great and people were so excited to meet Hazir Imam. Everyone at the table was also trying to make sure that every couple had an opportunity to see and to stand close to the Imam, should he circulate near us.

About 5 minutes before the event someone walked in an said that the Council President will do a speech, Hazir Imam will address the crowd, and then the senior leaders will stay to take the questions of the multifaith family members.

As soon as we heard this, there were whispers in the room. Did we hear this right, said the man next to me. He then asked our table lead if we heard this right and that Hazir Imam would not be walking in our tables. « Yes that is correct, this was not in Hazir Imam’s schedule ». We were baffled. Why do we have high tables setup, why are we practicing how to stand for the Imam if he is just going to address the crowd from afar and leave?

Then the president entered with Hazir Imam and said a few words about how happy she was to welcome our MF Members. Hazir Imam then took the stage and said (paraphrased) that this is the first gathering he will not be attending because these are becoming unmanageable (his words, not mine) and that he will address some questions during his speech. At the end of his speech, he mentioned that he thinks there is food for us to enjoy, and thanked everyone and moved away from the podium 

After MHI’s speech, some random lady that is the wife of a council leader (is anyone surprised?) extended her gratitude to Hazir Imam and said she represented the multifaith. But she had never talked with anyone how can she represent the multifaith? To convey what?

After this lady’s speech, Hazir Imam left the room and was accosted by someone who was at the table in front of his stage. After 2-3 minutes of chatting with her, he left the room. 

We all left disappointed with our spirits down. If we had to come here to listen to a speech, they shouldnt have planned for high tables.

To give more context, not everyone is based in Lisbon. People from  Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Porto, Algarve and even overseas stayed an extra day, taking time off from their work and school to be at this gathering. This felt like a slap on their face.

We are still grateful for Hazir Imam’s guidance. But being part of a multifaith family, every case is different, and not everything applies to everyone. We were left with more questions than anything.

We ismailis are used to suffering at the hands of the council and of our community. Many posts in this forum talk about the elite of our community and the nepotism. But to bring our multifaith families in this same boat is totally wrong and unacceptable. They have not pledged their bayah to Hazir Imam and owe him nothing except respect for the Ismaili faith. So to put them in a situation where they had to travel, take time off, cross the ocean and become sleep deprived only to hear a 15 minutes speech that does not even apply to them is disheartening and disrespectful.

She has connections and contacted me about doing a shoot for a coffee and cars type set of posters for a coffee shop. I was really eager and wanted to do the shoot. She put me in touch with the organizers to work the details. Initially they said they wanted 5 unique shots. I first quoted them 300 all in for that shoot. One of them took forever to reply and when he did he said that they were actually looking for 10 unique shots. I told him that likely doubles the work. He asked what my quote would be for that shoot and I told him it might be easier to just go with a flat rate. I said for 600, I'd guarantee at least ten shots, they would have me for several hours to do the shoot, and could request and direct my time and efforts as they saw fit. He baulked and walked away. 

A few details:  
They wanted photo lights and reflectors and equipment for a outdoor studio type shoot.   
I'm in NE Georgia, I'm not completely unknown, but I'm not the guy that everyone thinks about when you say photoshoot by any means, I'm just trying to build my business and not get taken.

They have been feeling burnt out for a very long time and have a hard time with life/work balance. They grew up in a working class family and have a fair amount of trauma involving hyper independence, money, productivity, and hard work. They find it nearly impossible to sit still, relax, or take time off and feel a lot of internal pressure to be productive at all times. 

I (33F) come from a very wealthy family and my mother died when I was a young adult, leaving me enough money that I don't realistically have to have a traditional job probably for the rest of my life, which is an enormous privilege that I don't take lightly. I bought our home and most of the things in it, and I pay for probably 95% of our household expenses. I also invested $100k into my spouse's business so they could get it off the ground with no expectation of repayment. I truly have no problem with this and think it's fair that I pay for most of our lives because I have more money. I also take care of probably 85-90% of our household in terms of chores, maintenance, and the general mental load of the domestic sphere. I am the one caring for our 2 dogs and 1 cat the majority of the time. I stay home and don't have a job and while I do feel a little bored and directionless sometimes, I enjoy my life for the most part. I read a lot, I play video games, I hang out with the animals, I keep in close touch with my friends, and I pursue some creative hobbies. 

Last night, my spouse said that they feel unhappy because our dynamic feels so unbalanced. The said they resent that they have to work so much and that I don't, and that I get to hang out at home and do what I want all day, and that it doesn't feel fair and is affecting our relationship and how they feel about me. While I totally understand why they feel that way, and agree that it isn't fair, I also feel like it's not fair for them to hold this against me. They've mentioned several times that they think I should just get a job at a coffee shop or a grocery store just to have something to do, even though I truly don't have any interest in doing so. The whole conversation left me feeling terrible that my spouse feels so unhappy, but I guess I just don't understand how me getting a job that I don't need or want is going to help them feel happier with our dynamic.

This question is for coffee lovers from the countries that drink the most coffee in the world — looking at you 🇫🇮🇳🇴🇸🇪🇩🇰🇮🇸 🇳🇱 🇺🇸 🇨🇦 😄

I’ve been diving into global coffee culture, and I realized something:
Some countries don’t just drink coffee… they live coffee.

So here’s a fun challenge:

👉 If you had to keep ONLY ONE coffee-related item (beans, machine, grinder, brewing method, accessory… anything) — what would it be and why?

Examples

“My Burr grinder — I can’t survive without it.”

“Dark roast beans from X brand.”

“My Aeropress. I’d give up everything else.”

I’m really curious to see the differences between Nordic countries, the Netherlands, the US, and Canada.
Let’s see which country has the strongest attachment to their coffee gear 😅☕🔥

For years I have been experiencing what seems like diabetes symptoms, but I am constantly assured that I in fact do not have diabetes, or even pre-diabetes.

However, I wake up anywhere from 1 (if I'm lucky) to maybe 6 times per night to pee. It's usually a full amount. If I don't get up to pee, I can't sleep. I also pee a lot during the day.

I go to bed at around 8 pm, and drink almost no water at all after around 3pm. When I wake up I usually feel pretty dehydrated, so I drink a lot of water in the mornings. For a while it was bad, and I was drinking more than 2 gallons of water a day. Now I take electrolytes and I'm probably closer to one.

I also get ravenouly hungry. There have been multiple times in my life where I've been fully convinced I had a tapeworm or something because I could just not stop eating.

I also get a lot of fatigue. And fatigue and hunger are usually worse after I eat. One of my darkest moments was when I ate lunch and had to put my head down on the table immediately after and started crying because it was the middle of the day but I was too tired to even sit up, i felt like i was literally starving to death, and wanted to go for a walk but was too tired. And I didn't even want coffee, all I could think of was more food.

I do rely a lot on caffeine though too. I can usually get by on 2 cups of coffee, but not less than that. I try to do one in the morning and one early afternoon, which usually allows me to stay up until around 8 or 9. Otherwise, I end up in bed before sunset.

I have no idea if any of these symptoms are actually connected. But either way, whats going on with me?

My biggest daily accomplishment was unjamming the printer. I felt like a background character in my own life, just watching the clock tick down until I could go home and zone out. The pay was just enough to keep me from quitting, but the work was soul-crushing. I spent my nights scrolling through job postings, feeling that familiar knot of dread in my stomach.

One evening, I stumbled down a rabbit hole of affiliate marketing blogs. It sounded like a total scam at first—'make money while you sleep!'—but something about it hooked me. I found a random, super-niche hobby I was into (think something like competitive underwater basket weaving) and decided to start a simple review blog. My first 'office' was my beat-up laptop balanced on a pillow in bed, surrounded by crumpled notes and half-empty coffee mugs.

Learning SEO from scratch felt like trying to drink from a firehose. I spent months writing content, tweaking my site, and staring at a flatlining Google Analytics graph. I almost gave up at least a dozen times. Then, one morning, I woke up to an email notification: 'You've made a commission.' It was only for $4.37, but I swear it felt like winning the lottery. I stared at the screen, heart pounding. That tiny sale wasn't just money; it was proof. It was a signal that this crazy, late-night project might actually work.

That little win lit a fire under me. I reinvested every dollar I made back into the site, learning everything I could about keyword research and link building. Slowly, painstakingly, that $4.37 a day turned into $10, then $50, then $200. The day I handed in my notice at the HR job was the most terrifying and exhilarating moment of my life. Now, I run a portfolio of these weird little niche sites, and my biggest commute is from the coffee maker to my desk. It all started with a random hobby and a whole lot of stubbornness.

I dont mean anything wild  just maybe meeting new people, talking more, trying to be a little braver than usual.

Thats where Im stuck.

Texas is huge, and every time I search online, people describe the cities like theyre completely different worlds. One person said Austin is quirky and social, another said Dallas is big city energy, and someone else told me San Antonio is friendly and low-pressure.
I dont know where someone like me fits into all of that.

Im the type who gets nervous just ordering at a new coffee shop, so the idea of ending up in a city where everyone is super confident and bold kind of terrifies me.

If anyone here is from Texas or knows the dating culture there, Id love advice. Specifically:

 Which city is the best for someone shy but open to meeting people?

It cuts through regeneration, overpowers abilities and powers, and can cancel universal-level abilities. The attack releases enormous slashes that devastate the opponent’s movements, body parts, and defenses with pinpoint accuracy.

Instant Cut: (Special Move)
Toro moves at extreme speed and slices the opponent instantly with his hat. This technique can decapitate without resistance, break through regeneration, cut steel and stone, destroy special moves, and tear through psychic abilities with ease.

Revelence Structure: (Special Move)
He reads an opponent’s aura, learns their moves, remembers them perfectly, and dodges even the “impossible-to-dodge” attacks. With this foresight, nothing truly lands on him.

Secret Blade Slash:
Toro’s hat transforms into steel. He throws it to unleash a devastating slash capable of breaking through strong defenses, cutting into an enemy’s body structure, and causing severe bleeding that limits their movement.

Hat Scissors Swift:
He unleashes a barrage of a million rapid slashes that travel in every direction. This attack destroys any move it touches and cannot be stopped due to its overwhelming force.

Teleportation Attacks:
Toro teleports instantly, striking repeatedly and causing his opponent to flinch with every hit. These attacks can exhaust the enemy and slow them down while Toro dodges and counters effortlessly.

Hat Slash Cancel:
He throws his hat to cancel an opponent’s abilities and powers entirely. This cancelation attack is faster than teleportation — even faster than time itself.

Boxing Techniques:
Toro is trained in advanced boxing using both fists and legs. He speeds up when hit, dodges while countering, destabilizes opponents, and uses kicks to pin enemies to the ground.

I usually drink more coffee than usually during clusters to kind of assist with my caffeine / melatonine levels, as those really mess me up during clusters (maybe this is just in my head and it doesnt have an effect though), but I've never really had any problems with it. 

  
Also, some sources report that coffee withdrawal can be a trigger for a cluster to occur, has anyone noticed anything like this? ",3,1764879149.0,ClusterHeadaches,5,1.0,False

I promised myself I would write this quickly and get it over with. So I am not writing this very carefully. Excuse any errors, omissions, or confusing writing.

If people have questions I will try to respond occasionally but will probably be bad about it.



Viability:

* Most businesses end up going out of business and that is always very much a possibility. My goal in year one was just to break even, not even cover my living expenses.
* The first year may be slow in terms of client work but you will be building a website, setting up various software programs, dealing with legal paperwork, IRS registration, forms, etc.
* In year one my overall earnings were probably about 35% of what I would have earned as an employee. In year two, my earnings overall were probably about 70% of what I would have earned as an employee.
* Knowing I had savings and could always go back to working was a big aid to me mentally.
* After two years, I feel more secure than I did working and am less stressed. Part of this is because I am conservative in terms of how much work I take on.



My experience and qualifications when I started my firm:

* 5 years of experience in tax preparation at a single quality firm
* CPA credential
* I was manager level and had never signed a return.
* Because I did a mid-career change, I had about 10 years total professional work experience when I started my firm.



Current client mix:

* Maybe \~80% individual returns; \~10% business entities; \~10% trusts.
* The individual returns i do are definitely on the more complex end with rentals, equity compensation, and schedule c's.
* I definitely recommend focusing on what you are good at even if it means saying no. I have found it helpful if clients are not a good fit for me to try and find referral resources as it feels better to refer than to say no.



Business Location:

* I work from home in a high income area. 



Marketing: Yelp mostly

* I started my firm with no clients. I have been adding about \~50 clients a year
* In the beginning I did ask a few friends that I had helped with tax stuff to leave a review for me on Yelp.
* In the beginning almost all my clients found me via Yelp. I do have more referrals now from old colleagues, financial advisors, and current clients.
* I did pay for a basic level of yelp marketing the first couple years (talk to a rep and you can get a good deal).
* I did not reach out to any of the clients from my previous firm but a couple of them found me on LinkedIn. I was manager level so all the clients I had been working with were the “partner’s” clients and not “mine”.
* It can be smart to connect with clients via LinkedIn so that they can find you if you ever leave your firm.
* I am based in a high income area and being in a high income area one-hundred percent helped me even though I work from home. Many clients found me based on geographic proximity shown on Yelp.
* For Yelp, I used a USPS box as my address since I work from home.
* For me starting from scratch has been a bit of a blessing as it give me a clean slate to work from, and taught me what works and what doesn’t.
* I might advise trying to start without buying a book of business and then buying a book of business after a year if you are not happy with your growth rate. That gives you some time to learn the ropes of building a business before jumping into the deep end. It also helps you avoid potential lemons or overpaying for something you don't need.
* Growth has been about as fast as I would want. I stopped accepting clients for my third busy season in November; I stopped accepting new clients for my second busy season in January.
* I had a beard partly to make myself look more mature in client meetings (I look young without a beard). I am no longer keeping the beard, but I do think it helped in the beginning. Wearing glasses probably would help too but I did not do that.
* Clients will very much judge you based on how knowledgeable you are during the initial prospective client meeting (see below)
* When your business is brand new clients will be more skeptical then after a year or two. There is not much you can do about that other than wait for time to pass.



Client emails:

* I handle all emails with clients.
* I move client emails to a shared inbox folder to so that my employee has access to read
* I maintain inbox zero pretty well.
* I have an incoming folder for notifications about things like document uploads and document signatures. I have inbox rules set up so that these types of notification emails go to that inbox automatically. Both my employee and I have access to that folder to manage incoming items



Client meetings: Acuity and Zoom

* I use a combination of Acuity and Zoom so that clients can self-schedule meetings on my website.
* Acuity has the best looking website scheduler in my opinion. It integrates well with Zoom which is why I chose Zoom.
* At this point, the phone number on my website goes to a voicemail. If a prospective new client leaves a message, I text rather than call asking them to schedule a meeting on my website.
* If a prospective new client emails me, I respond asking them to schedule a meeting on my website. I mostly have a template that I copy and paste to respond.
* If a prospective client reaches out to me by Yelp, I respond in Yelp asking them to schedule a meeting on my website. I mostly have a template that I copy and paste to respond.
* I will take phone calls from existing clients who get my direct my number.
* Existing clients have their own meeting type on my website that they can schedule. This is especially helpful if they want to schedule a meeting to review a return.
* Scheduling meetings without a scheduling tools really sucks and I avoid it as much as possible.



Prospective client meeting:

* Prospective clients self-schedule the prospective client meeting (see above regarding Zoom and Acuity)
* In the beginning, I was a little self-conscience about not having a brick and mortar and did meet a couple prospective clients in person at coffee shops. Now I never do that for the first meeting and rarely at all.
* In the beginning new client meetings were free and I definitely gave free advice. I now charge $60 for a 30-minute meeting. The meeting usually goes more than 30 minutes.
* During the initial meeting I start by asking them to introduce themselves and provide a little background on their tax situation. I will eventually ask about: equity compensation, if they have schedule K-1’s, rental properties, crypto-currency trading, foreign bank or financial accounts, bookkeeping software, separate bank accounts for businesses, employees, retirement plans, health insurance if through a business, itemized deductions, etc. The meeting is thorough.
* During the initial client meeting I will almost always provide a fee estimate without looking at the return (see pricing below).
* After the client meeting I email the client a fairly thorough summary of the meeting mostly focused on their tax situation (written by me, not AI). If they want to move forward, they respond to that email to let me know. I then also have a good summary for myself when I have forgotten the conversation entirely.

 

Tax software: Started with Lacerte, switched to CCH Axcess

* Lacerte was great in a lot of ways but not being cloud-native was the nail in the coffin for me. You can put Lacerte on a virtual desktop, which I did using AceCloud Pro once I added an employee. Still, I decided CCH Axcess would be the better fit for me in the long-term and bit the bullet of migrating \~100 clients.
* Someday I might consider a fully “virtual desktop” solution where all my software (browser, email, files, tax software, etc.) is hosted in a virtual environment on my “own” servers. However, not sure if that makes sense or not.
* One mistake I made was purchasing Lacerte without talking to a sales rep. I would have gotten a bigger discount if I had. CCH gave me a good deal for my first year.
* The only thing I really miss about Lacerte is the cover letter which nicely summarized state and federal estimated tax payments into one table rather than two tables. The biggest issue I had with Lacerte was for some trust return calculations and the fact that most of my more complex clients are coming from firms that use CCH. I also found it more difficult to review K-1's reported on 1040's in Lacerte (CCH has supplemental schedules in the tax return that I like).
* Before starting my business, I trialed Drake with a few friend and family returns. I found Drake very deficient compared to both Lacerte and Axcess.
* Generally I review off the ""client copy"" version of the return so that I know it has everything I want and that layout makes sense.

 

Automated tax form data entry: Gruntworx

* I use Gruntworx for the initial automated tax form data entry.
* I believe SurePrep has something similar but slightly more expensive at \~$45/client. I did not know of SurePrep's product when I started with GruntWorx, not sure which I would choose now.

 

Legal entity: started as sole proprietor, switched to S-Corp

* If I had the option of doing an LLC, I would recommend doing that from the beginning, however, my state’s CPA licensing board does not allow me to practice as an LLC.
* Looking back, I probably would set up the S-Corp from the beginning mainly to prevent having to change EIN’s, registration with IRS, and such.
* I used LawInc to set up my entity and it was a smooth process although fairly barebones.
* If I ever add partners, I believe I will be able to use wages, bonuses, commissions, and such to allocate income in reasonably flexible manners. That said, the restrictions on allocating income is definitely a major downside to S-Corps and my choice of entity might have been different if I had a partner currently.

 

Internal file storage: currently using SharePoint with automated back-ups via a third-party.

* If I was starting over, I would probably try CCH Engagement or SmartVault for workpaper storage. Getting file storage working well with SharePoint has been a little more complicated, glitchy, and expensive than I thought it would be.
* I am usually pretty willing to DIY, but did end up hiring a 3^(rd) party to do secure back-ups of my SharePoint files.
* If you are using SharePoint or OneDrive, I like Directory Opus because it allows you to expand folders in a branching view, similar to what I understand Apple users have. It also allows you to color code files green or other colors which is good for having things reviewed.

 

Client file portal: ShareFile

* I use ShareFile. Note sure if it is any better than SafeSend or SmartVault. But those are probably the main three I know of and would look at.

 

Annual Questionnaire / engagement letter:

* I am a lunatic and write my own annual questionnaire using Cognito Forms. It is more of an idiosyncratic rabbit hole than I would like to get into here. But I do like Cognito Forms if you want a form builder.
* I also use Cognito Forms for my engagement letter and onboarding forms and it is probably more straight forward for that purpose since it is shorter and does not involve saving.

 

Pricing: I use almost only estimated-fee prices, not hourly

* Without looking at a tax return, I will generally quote an estimated fee during my first introductory client meetings. My introductory calls are very thorough (see above)
* I do think it helps to have a few go-to tiers in mind, I use the following estimate ranges quite a bit: $1,000 - $1,300;  $1,400 - $1,700; $2,000 - $2,500.
* I have had a few complaints on price, but not many. I have been told I need to charge more and have been increasing prices gradually as my business has become more established.
* I do have an hourly price in my engagement letter at $200 / hour but I almost never use it and even my engagement letter says that it only applies if we have not provided an estimated fee for the specific project. I do not have a different hourly rate for my employee than myself as it did not seem worth it to differentiate given how little we use it.
* I send out fee estimates for all clients in \~December for the upcoming tax season using a mail merge tool
* Revenue in year 2 was roughly \~$1.5K to \~$2.0K per tax client, which includes some delinquent returns and consulting work. Median return pricing is probably \~$1K - \~$1.5K in a high cost area.
* I charge when I send the tax return. I do not charge separately for 15-30 minute questions. I do not do any subscription pricing.

 

Employees:

* I hired someone who was comfortable with a flexible schedule for my first employee.
* I pay hourly including overtime during tax season and aim to keep total hours per week at 55 or less.
* Outside of tax season I have been averaging 16 hours for my employee mostly.",46,1764879112.0,Accounting,7,0.92,False
