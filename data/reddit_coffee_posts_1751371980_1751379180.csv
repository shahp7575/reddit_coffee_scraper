Okay, Reddit, I gotta share this handbag I just got. I‚Äôve been on the hunt for something that wasn't, you know, *basic*. Something that actually said something about me, instead of just holding my stuff.

For context, I'm in my early 30s, work a 9-to-5 but live for the weekends, love hitting up art galleries and trying new restaurants, and my wardrobe is...eclectic. I'm *that* friend who always has a slightly different, maybe a little bit bolder, take on fashion. Finding accessories that match *that* vibe is HARD.

I was tired of the same old boring black totes and sad beige crossbodies. I wanted something that would make me feel confident, stylish, and just a little bit unique. Is that too much to ask? Apparently not, because I stumbled across this leopard print handbag with red accents, and it‚Äôs been a game changer. (Oops, almost used one of *those* phrases!)

Seriously though, this bag. The leopard print is classic, but the red accents are what really make it pop. It‚Äôs like a party in handbag form. üíÉüèΩ I get compliments *every single time* I carry it. My coworkers, my friends, even the barista at my local coffee shop have all commented on it. And you know what? It feels good! It‚Äôs a little boost of confidence every time I leave the house.

What I really needed was a stylish and functional handbag that makes a statement! That might sound shallow, but honestly, when you feel good about how you look, everything else just seems to fall into place a little easier, you know? And I was getting frustrated trying to choose from a lack of unique designs, or poor quality bags.

Beyond the looks, it‚Äôs actually a really well-made bag. The material feels durable, and the stitching is solid. I'm so tired of replacing cheap bags every few months, which makes me feel like the high quality is reducing the need to buy multiple bags. I can tell this thing is going to last me a while, which is a huge plus because, let‚Äôs be real, I am *not* gentle with my handbags. Plus, the organized compartments inside are a lifesaver. No more digging around for my keys or phone! I am saving time, decreasing stress and frustration.

I‚Äôve been rocking it everywhere. To work (it adds a fun twist to my business casual outfits), to brunch with the girls (it‚Äôs a total conversation starter), and even on a recent weekend trip (it held all my essentials and looked amazing in my travel pics). That eliminates the need to buy multiple bags for different occasions! I thought if I bought this bag it would eliminate the fear of looking underdressed or out of style!

I was scrolling through ursupermart.com (don‚Äôt judge, sometimes I just need some retail therapy) and saw it. It was that bold combination of leopard print with red accents that no competing bags have! I normally do a lot of research online, looking on social media for different fashion styles.

It's that specific shade and placement of the red accents that got me to choose it over alternatives. It also solves that need for a stylish and functional bag.

If you're looking for a way to spice up your wardrobe and add a little bit of edge to your style, I highly recommend checking this bag out. It's a little bit of luxury without breaking the bank.

I hope I could inspire you to express your personal style, feel confident, and stand out from the crowd.

Here's where I got it, if you are curious: [https://go.ursupermart.com/GAOPv3](https://go.ursupermart.com/GAOPv3)

Honestly, it‚Äôs one of those purchases that I just don‚Äôt regret. It‚Äôs brought me so much joy and confidence! And I am confident that the expected return on investment over the lifespan of the bag, compared to cheaper alternatives will be worth it!

I‚Äôd seen it recommended a bunch online, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a go even though it‚Äôs more expensive than others. My main use has been for streaming and a bit of privacy on public Wi-Fi when I‚Äôm working from coffee shops. Setup was really quick. The app looks clean, and I liked how you don‚Äôt need to mess with a bunch of settings to get started. I mostly just hit the power button and let it choose the fastest server nearby. Streaming-wise, it's been solid. Netflix US, Hulu, and even Disney+ worked for me almost every time. Only once or twice did I have to switch servers when something got blocked. Speeds have been fast enough for HD streaming with no buffering. I even used it while traveling in Europe to access some sites from home, and it worked better than expected. Now for the stuff I didn‚Äôt like, sometimes the app on my Android phone takes a while to connect, especially when switching networks. Also, it doesn‚Äôt always reconnect automatically after dropping. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, just a bit annoying. Another thing is the price. It‚Äôs definitely more expensive than some other options, so I‚Äôm still debating whether I‚Äôll renew when the time comes.",1,1751379022.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

Any glaring ommissions?,"I have a large wet bar in my basement and decided it was finally time to get myself together and learn how to make cocktails. I made up this menu and an accompanying recipe book so I could entertain friends a few times a year. It might look a little odd because I've deleted some identifying information.

We throw a decent number of parties, so the bar gets good use, but I'm not down there every week, so I made long lasting ingredients a priority, i.e. egg white alternative, dehydrated lemons and limes, bottled lemon and lime juice (I anticipate I might get shit for that in particular but I do plan to get actual citrus for parties). I have two mini fridges under the bar.

I'm a novice so it was important that the cocktails be relatively simple. I don't want to do a lot of steps.

I also have too much random alcohol (not complaining, but friends and family have donated stuff they don't want to me because I have a bar) so I wanted to get the ingredients I keep on hand down to a manageable amount. To do this I tried to make multiple cocktails with almost every ingredient, and made ""specials"" with ingredients I'm trying to get rid of.

1lp2jj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lp2jj0/is_my_friend_looking_for_an_entourage_not_actual/,"Is my friend looking for an entourage, not actual friends?","I (23f) have this best friend (24f). We‚Äôve been extremely close since we met 5 years ago. We‚Äôve lived together, she moved to my city. She‚Äôs incredibly sweet, kind, caring, and we share so many niche interests. Our parents have the same names and jobs, we both grew up between two cities, our grandparents are from the same town‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs always felt uncanny. We‚Äôve been such good friends ‚Äî until this year.

We‚Äôve drifted apart a lot. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but maybe that‚Äôs life. I can‚Äôt imagine she‚Äôs okay with it, but she‚Äôs not doing anything to stop it.

A few months ago she started a new full-time job. I wasn‚Äôt upset when communication slowed ‚Äî big change, totally fair. But it never picked up again. It‚Äôs been around four months, and I haven‚Äôt seen her in two. She still says she‚Äôs ‚Äúbusy with work,‚Äù but she‚Äôs constantly out with school friends, going to festivals, etc. I‚Äôve asked to catch up so many times, but it‚Äôs always ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm busy xxx‚Äù ‚Äî with no alternative, or just one hour in two months for a coffee. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

I started thinking about when the drifting really started. Even before the job, she stopped wanting to do things I suggested, like gigs or galleries. I had an art show and she didn‚Äôt come ‚Äî but told people to go to her work event instead. When I said I was hurt that our mutuals skipped my show, she snapped at me.

Then I realised: all she ever talks about is her cool life ‚Äî but it‚Äôs always stories about other people doing wild things. None of it is really about her. She only wants to talk about how cool she seems. And when I talk, she doesn‚Äôt listen ‚Äî or she gets frustrated ‚Äî unless it benefits her somehow. I started wondering if she only values people when they bring her clout or flashiness.

Now I feel crazy that the illusion‚Äôs shattered. The only time she wants to talk or hang out is when:
a) someone has something to offer her
b) she wants an audience
c) her other plans fall through

She steers every conversation back to herself ‚Äî even if we‚Äôre talking about the weather. I could say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hot today,‚Äù and she‚Äôd go, ‚ÄúNot as hot as these two guys who invited me backstage at a gig‚Ä¶‚Äù

It‚Äôs bizarre. The thing is ‚Äî if she just showed some real care, I‚Äôd want to hear about her weekends. I love her, and I‚Äôd be happy for her, like I used to be. But I guess I‚Äôm not cool enough anymore to be a tier 1 friend.

Her whole vibe is so patronising. It‚Äôs like everything has to be a competition, or revolve around her ‚Äúbrand.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt show up for me. And somehow, her being ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù isn‚Äôt her fault.

Now she‚Äôs suddenly reaching out again ‚Äî maybe her cooler plans have dried up. She invited me to a work event she‚Äôs working (not to catch up). Probably just wants to fill the room and bask in how cool she looks. She offered to hang out in two weeks because it‚Äôs the only time she‚Äôs free.

Has anyone seen Julie & Julia? That Cobb salad scene ‚Äî ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when I can fit you in!‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúMay I remind you, I don‚Äôt want to see you, you want to see me?‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúWould a breakfast work?‚Äù That‚Äôs how it always feels.

I thought my issues were thyroid related or endometriosis, but nothing ever came back as a reg flag. Having had painful periods most of my life I advocated for myself to have a diagnostic laparoscopic surgery where I was told I had adenomyosis, but that didn‚Äôt explain all of my symptoms.

My (F24, 5‚Äô10‚Äù 101lbs) transglutaminase lgA came back at 85, highly indicating celiac disease. Got my endoscopy and official diagnosis on June 10th, since then I have gone gluten free and lost 5 pounds. Years ago my best weight was around 120, also technically underweight. 

This is really scary for me as someone who already was dealing with unintentional weight loss and an inability to gain weight. I‚Äôve been obsessing over hitting my calorie goals for the day and everything feels too overwhelming. I work as a barista at a coffee shop and making sure I eat enough on days I work was hard enough before having to cut out gluten. 

This morning I tried making an 800-900 calorie protein shake and could barely stomach it. By the time I was at my last sips I felt sick to my stomach and tried breathing through it but couldn‚Äôt make it and threw it all up. 

I feel defeated, alone, and completely overwhelmed. I made a followup with a dietician, who apparently is not covered by insurance, and cant see me for another month.

I walk into the interview room completely calm because I'm not worried about getting the job, and I completely turn the tables on them: What benefits does the company offer? Why should I work there? How are you competitive with other businesses in the area?

The responses I get range from confusion to the interviewers trying to convince me I should work there.

And then I drop the bomb. When it's time to talk salary, I always say that it's not very competitive in the current market, then I act like I'm in a hurry, thank them for their time, and walk right out the door.

I'm sure there's something wrong with me. And I'm also sure that the next person who goes to the interview will have a much better experience.

What to watch at the Calgary Stampede Rodeo and chuckwagon races



Every afternoon at 1:30, the world‚Äôs best rodeo athletes compete for a total of $2.17 million in prize money. Chuckwagon races take place nightly at 7:30 p.m.



Rodeo tickets include free admission into Stampede Park for that day. Assigned seating tickets can be purchased online and standing room only tickets will be available at the gate day-of starting at 11 a.m.

Barrel racing



In a race against the clock, contestants circle three barrels and race back to the score line. Riders are permitted to touch barrels, but a five-second penalty is added to their time if one is knocked over.



Bull riding



Riders attempt to remain mounted on a bull while the animal bucks violently. While not required to move their feet, riders can get higher marks if they spur.



Tie-down roping



A cowboy riding horseback chases a calf with a 10-foot head start, attempting to rope the calf and dismount on the run to reach it and tie three of its legs.



Steer wresting



A steer wrestler on horseback chases a steer with a 12-foot head start, eventually dropping from his horse and grabbing the steer by its horns. A steer must be on its feet before being rolled to the ground, and once on its side the official time is taken.



Saddle bronc



A rider will move his feet from the horse neck toward the back of the saddle as the bronc bucks. hand placement is key in this eight-second event.



Bareback riding



Needing to hold on for at least eight-seconds, bareback riders extend their feet far forward on their horse and pull their feet up toward the rigging around the horses girth in a spurring motion. The higher the spurs, the higher the score.



Breakaway roping



Requiring speed and precision, breakaway roping is one of the fastest events in rode. The rider, following a calf with a head start, is required to rope the calf and stop their horse as quickly as possible. This will cause the rope to ‚Äúbreakaway‚Äù from the saddle horn it is tied to, and time stops. Ladies‚Äô breakaway roping is new to the Calgary Stampede rodeo this year.



Chuckwagon races



Watch nine nightly heats as 27 chuckwagon drivers and 162 horses race for prize money.

As someone who relies heavily on caffeine to get through long workdays, finding a reliable coffee maker has always been important. I‚Äôve been using this model in a shared office space for several weeks now, and it has certainly lived up to expectations, though there are a few quirks worth mentioning.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the standout features of this coffee machine is its sleek, compact design. The matte black exterior not only looks modern but also fits seamlessly into any kitchen or office setup. Measuring just 12.4"" x 10.3"" x 12.1"", this machine doesn‚Äôt hog valuable counter space. The large handle on the 96 oz. water reservoir makes refilling simple and spill-free, which is a life-saver in spaces with limited time to fuss over appliances. The build feels sturdy, and the buttons are intuitive, allowing anyone‚Äîcoffee expert or novice‚Äîto quickly navigate its functions.  

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
With four cup sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces) to choose from, this machine caters to everyone's caffeine needs. What makes it even better is the STRONG button, which amps up the flavor and intensity of your coffee. I‚Äôve used this feature quite a bit when I need an extra kick in the morning. Additionally, Quiet Brew Technology is a blessing in an office setting; it produces minimal noise even during peak brewing hours, so no one feels disturbed. It‚Äôs easy to tell they‚Äôve designed this unit with functionality and user-friendliness in mind.  

**Highlights**  
- STRONG button enhances coffee flavor and intensity.  
- Quiet Brew Technology reduces noise significantly.  
- Accommodates different cup sizes (6 oz. to 12 oz.).  
- Large 96 oz. reservoir eliminates the need for constant refills.  

[Check Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The fully automated operation mode makes brewing as easy as pressing a single button, and the machine delivers consistently great coffee every time. The reusable filter system is also a thoughtful feature, saving money over time and cutting waste from disposable filters. While cleaning it is relatively easy due to the non-porous materials, the machine‚Äôs size might make it tricky to fit under some sinks for deep cleaning of the reservoir. However, it‚Äôs manageable with a little adjustment.  

**Downsides**  
There are a couple of areas where this machine doesn‚Äôt quite hit the mark.  
- The machine‚Äôs size, while compact, might feel a bit bulky for solo users.  
- Lack of a dedicated hot water dispenser, meaning you‚Äôre limited to brewing coffee or tea pods rather than using it for other beverages like instant soup.  

**Competing Products**  
While the Keurig K1500 holds its own in terms of functionality and design, it faces stiff competition. One notable rival is the Nespresso Vertuo, which offers similar brewing functionality but focuses on espresso-style beverages and boasts a more compact footprint. The downfall of the Nespresso is its higher price for coffee pods and lack of STRONG flavor customization. On the other hand, budget-friendly machines like the Hamilton Beach Single Serve Brewer offer decent features for a lower cost; however, they fall short in durability and reservoir size. The Keurig K1500 balances well between affordability and features, especially for spaces needing multiple servings.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
What impressed me most about this machine is how well it balances cost and functionality. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, the durability, efficiency, and quality justify the investment. Over time, the ability to choose reusable filters can also make this machine more cost-effective than models requiring excessive single-use pods. For a small office or business environment (or even a busy household with multiple coffee drinkers), this machine delivers excellent value.

I grew up in the 90s between Spain and the UK in a dysfunctional, secretive family deeply tied to drug culture, coercive dynamics, and emotional abuse. My mother fled my biological father (who was later diagnosed autistic and severely anxious) and entered a new relationship with a man who became heavily involved in the Costa del Sol drug scene. Think less glamour, more paranoia, secrecy, and unspoken rules. My childhood was full of chaos‚Äîmoving houses constantly, new schools, unstable friendships, and regular exposure to criminal figures.

At home, I endured frequent physical abuse‚Äîbeing dragged by my hair, pinned to walls, and emotionally violated. I became the emotional scapegoat early on, often left sleeping outside my mother‚Äôs door on a wooden chest as a child, always sensing I didn‚Äôt quite belong. When my younger brother was born, the contrast became more obvious‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt blood-related to her partner, and the emotional abandonment deepened.

Despite obvious trauma signs, I was never supported. I had early signs of autism, was creatively gifted, and invited to special education programmes, but my mother blocked those opportunities. She was unpredictable, emotionally detached unless drugs or validation were involved. Cocaine use was always a silent undercurrent‚Äî‚Äúnormal‚Äù in our house. Love was transactional. Any affection often came when they were high or in trouble.

After we moved back to the UK in my teens, things escalated. I walked in on my mother having a relationship with my older male friend, someone I‚Äôd introduced from the stables. I was hurt, confused, and gaslit about it. When I tried to voice distress or seek support‚Äîeven through a suicide attempt at 14‚ÄîI was ignored. I called her during that attempt, and she continued driving. The message was clear: I was disposable, an inconvenience.

I grew older, internalising everything. Bottling up, exploding when pushed too far, and then being punished or smeared for reacting. A pattern. I became hyper-accountable‚Äîdesperately trying to unlearn toxic traits, avoid replicating dysfunction, and analyse both myself and others to survive. I did everything I could to avoid becoming ‚Äúlike them.‚Äù

In adulthood, I slowly realised the emotional manipulation wasn‚Äôt isolated‚Äîit was structural. Everyone around my mother either enabled her or feared being the next target. When I began standing up for myself, pushing back on being the caretaker, calling out the emotional negligence toward my youngest sibling and the animals, the retaliation began.

Over the last year‚Äîespecially the last 5 months‚Äîtheir cocaine use became worse. Things turned more covert, more bizarre. They started standing outside my bedroom door, whispering smear campaigns over the phone. My room was searched while I was out. I still don‚Äôt know what they were looking for‚ÄîI had nothing to hide. Maybe just proof that I was ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù to discredit me, or justify casting me out.

What hurt most was realising I had no backup. I turned to my grandfather for support, who told me, ‚ÄúEven if your mum had stabbed someone, I‚Äôd lie to protect her.‚Äù That was the final blow. The message was clear: the truth doesn‚Äôt matter. Only loyalty to the dysfunction.

I left, financially bled dry and traumatised where my body was in constant trauma, the moments I was not was shortly after waking up. I now live in my technically illegal car.

[$400],"It's been some time since I got my DeLonghi Dedica Ec685. I definitely enjoy it. It makes good espresso (although not always consistently, but it's probably because of my lack of expertise), but still it's pretty much entry-level. It does not yield much crema, not as much as I get when having espresso at caf√©s, although I use a non-pressurized basket and fresh coffee. It also clogs way too early, when my grinder is like on step 6.

I was thinking about selling my Dedica and getting something that can better utilize my grinder's potential. The thing is, in my country, DeLonghi is the only European/Western brand available. Others are mostly brands that are either Chinese or made in the ME. Still, there are good and well-regarded brands among these, and although you may not be familiar with them outside here, they still kick ass and some people in my country even prefer them to DeLonghi. They also provide more bang for buck than brands like DeLonghi, since there's less import fees for them here.

So the thing is, is it worth it to sell my Dedica and get a more powerful machine, twice as much the price of the Dedica? Or should I just be happy with it and stop worrying about power?

Posted yesterday with much enthusiasm about getting to 36 hours in my fast, and happy to report that 61 hours in, I'm still feeling well. I am planning on continuing my fast at least through today.

My question: I ran into a friend yesterday and we've made dinner plans on Thursday. **What is the safest time frame for breaking my fast to avoid digestive upset at the meal with her?** This is my first time doing an extended fast, so I can't rely on past experience to inform my decisions. 

I see there being two options:   
1) Fasting until sometime on Thursday (for a total of \~112 hours of fasting) and taking a few hours to ease back into eating, ending with my dinner with my friend.  
2) Fasting until sometime tomorrow (for a total of \~90 hours of fasting), following the same plan of easing back into eating, and then just doing a 24 hour fast before eating with my friend. 

For context, this has been a dirty fast, though the only thing I've allowed thus far is about 50cals of creamer in my morning coffee (fasting for weight loss atm). I have bone broth on hand for later today if I feel it's necessary, but not anticipating that need at the moment.

Also, I have read about how the stomach shrinks during prolonged fasting, but I'm not sure if fasts of this duration are long enough for that effect to occur. I'm asking because I want to know how large a meal to order with my friend - something small/medium sized because my stomach will still be recovering, or something larger (like I would do on OMAD) to get my nutrition back in?

Thanks for any advice you have! I've been really pleasantly surprised with my experience on this fast.",2,1751376993.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

1lp1qcd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lp1qcd,Cred Steal! Turkey Tail Shroom Coffee Review (ACF Blend),"Just wanted to share my experience with this ""Turkey Tail Shroom Coffee"" from ACF Blend. I managed to snag a 5-sachet trial pack from Cred for only ‚Çπ99, which felt like an absolute steal!
First impressions from the box (from the pic):
The packaging is pretty cool, with a purple and white theme and what looks like a cross-section of a turkey tail mushroom. It highlights Turkey Tail Shroom Coffee. It also mentions ""ALL NATURAL ACTIVES,"" ""NO ADDED SUGAR,"" ""DAIRY FREE,"" and ""GLUTEN FREE,"" which are all great if you're looking for those specific benefits. Each serving contains 500mg of Turkey Tail Mushroom Extract, and it explicitly states ""GUT HEALTH"" at the bottom, indicating its intended benefit. It comes with 5 servings, as the pack confirms.

My Taste Experience:
Okay, so the taste... it's definitely an experience. Imagine dried mushrooms, ground into a powder ‚Äì that's pretty much the dominant earthy flavor. It also had a noticeable sour note to it, which was a bit unexpected. I ended up adding a touch of honey to sweeten it up, and that definitely helped balance it out.

Overall Verdict:
I actually liked it! It's unique and interesting. However, it's not something that blew me away to the point where I'd make it a regular part of my routine. For ‚Çπ99, it was absolutely worth trying and a fun experiment, but I probably won't be rushing to buy a full pack again. Good, but not that good, if that makes sense.

**Hello everyone!**

Following up on my first post (link above), I‚Äôm sharing the next steps in my Vietnamese learning journey.

I keep adjusting my learning method. HOWEVER : even though I look so enthusiast about a way of learning doesn't mean I won't change my mind later! It also evolves with my level. Feel free to criticize everything!

I also took a week off class to travel in VN. At that point it seemed essential for me to rest a bit!

# 1. Tools I Use Alongside Classes

* **For vocabulary and some grammar retention**: ANKI app
* **For listening comprehension**: **Language Crush website**, **YouTube** (""**khoai lang thang**"" ; ""5 ng√†y web"" ), Netflix
* **Vietnamese keyboard**
* **OpenAI**: For translation, explaining nuances between similar words, and creating custom texts
* **Website for generating southern-accented Vietnamese audio**: [https://speechactors.com](https://speechactors.com)
* **Articles** : [https://vnexpress.net](https://vnexpress.net)
* **Audio + Reading ""The Little Prince"" :** [https://radiosach.com/sach/hoang-tu-be.html](https://radiosach.com/sach/hoang-tu-be.html) / [https://teachvn.com/index.php?route=information/download&pid=1219](https://teachvn.com/index.php?route=information/download&pid=1219)

# 2. The Method

**> Daily Private Lessons:**  
I‚Äôm continuing my one-on-one classes with a teacher but I‚Äôve reduced the hours: now just 3 hours per day, Monday to Thursday. The lessons are still focused on conversation, role plays, and short presentations. I take full advantage of having regular access to a teacher to ask about grammar and semantic subtleties.

**> Daily Self-Study:**  
I‚Äôve completely changed my self-study method. I now study around 4 - 5 hours a day from Monday to Friday and a also during weekends (time varies but at least 5h on the all weekend), with the majority of my learning time focused on **listening and reading**.

**HEARING**

* **Language Crush Videos ‚Äì 3-Step Method (spread over several days ++)**

1. I watch new videos segment by segment using the same method I described in my previous post: listening without the script, then with the script, learning the key new vocabulary, grammar and idioms, then re-listening to see if I can catch those words.
2. I rewatch old videos, this time in full, both without and with the script, several times. This helps me anchor the words, catch new ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù words I didn‚Äôt focus on during the first listens. I repeat this until I understand around 80% of the audio.
3. **Shadowing (with videos I know well):** At this stage, I‚Äôve already listened to the videos at least 10 times. I listen to one sentence, pause, repeat out loud, and so on. after that, I go back and shadow the whole segment **in sync with the audio**.

* **AI-Generated Audio:** Using vocabulary lists from my classes, conversations with locals, and Language Crush videos, I ask an AI to generate texts for me using my current vocabulary as much as possible. I feed thoses texts into [Speechactors.com](https://speechactors.com) to generate audio. This gives me scripts + audio with vocabulary I‚Äôm currently learning. Then I listen without and with the script ! I usually ask the AI to make sentences level A2 so I won't be bothered by a complex grammar, but I change context every time (""write a dialogue between two colleagues"", ""write about a family problem"", ...)

**READING :**

* [**https://vnexpress.net**](https://vnexpress.net) \+++ : They have **so many little articles about ALL topics**: Education, Sports, Environnement, Economics ...  For now I stick to the ""health"" category with simple articles like ""5 good habits for health"" ; ""6 beverages to lower blood pressure"", ... Of course I have to learn vocabulary specific to health but as they appear so many times I actually memorize them. Same as audio exercice, I will read them several times. T
* **""The Little Prince""** : I found an audiobook from a speaker with southern accent, and also the script that matches the audio (links above). I try to handle a few pages per day, listening and reading, then translating main ideas, then listening and reading again.

**ANKI:**  
I‚Äôve almost stopped doing solo speaking practice. There are obviously to many words and I can't spend 4h a day with ANKI, so now I mainly use it as a **vocabulary storage system**, focusing on harder words during review sessions.

**PASSIVE LEARNING ASIDE STUDYING HOURS :**

I heard that passive listening must not be put aside, so I try to find a good habit to listen/watch vietnamese without crushing my brain.

The podcast ""tri k·ª∑ c·∫£m x√∫c"" I mentionned in my last post is WAY above my skills. It is also on Youtube, channel name is ""web5ngay"" and there is script on the video but even with subtitles it is still very hard to follow so I stopped. Though, when I will reach better skills then I will definitely get back to thoses podcasts.

I tried Heo Peppa but I get so bored. Though I can understand many things, I can't watch this more than 10 minuts.

=> I started to watch YT videos of **Khoai Lang Thang** (southern speaker, clear voice) and they are more reachable for my current skills. Moreover I actually enjoy very much the content of his videos. Sometimes I translate a word I see many times, but besides that I just listen to the flow, listen and read the automatic subtitles (not perfect though).

Thanks to HelloTalk, I‚Äôve met Vietnamese learners of French ‚Äî I try to meet one of them twice a week and exchange in both languages.

# 3. Results / Reflections (Approx. 350h total study time - 8 weeks since the beginning of class).

**Level achieved**: **B1-**

**SPEAKING:**  
I‚Äôve gained a lot of confidence ++ and fluency. I no longer feel ashamed to speak Vietnamese with locals, even though I still occasionally notice puzzled looks.  
My comfort zone is expanding. I‚Äôve started using a few idiomatic expressions I‚Äôve heard many times and that now feel natural in context.  
I especially remember a recent evening spent speaking only Vietnamese with a native speaker ‚Äî everything flowed quite naturally (of course, no serious talks about politics, but family, trips, goals in life ...). I felt genuinely moved!

**LISTENING:**  
I started from a very low level, but I‚Äôm finally seeing progress! Especially when talking to locals I already know ‚Äî I‚Äôve gotten used to their speech patterns.  
In face-to-face conversation with a new local it varies, but I would estimate my understanding skills (average) to 20-25%% of what they say. However, I still get completely lost when two locals talk to each other (but since I can‚Äôt guide the discussion toward familiar vocabulary, it is way harder than when I am taking part in the discussion).

**NB** : I understand most of what my teacher says, but still **huge bias as speaking with a teacher is not real life!**

**READING :** I still feel it is way easier to understand a text than an audio. The VN Express website is a real goldmine, the more I read them, the more it is fun and feel less like studying!

# 4. Conclusion / Advice

***INPUT IS KEY !***

=> I reduced my class hours when I realized that talking lessons shouldn‚Äôt take up half of my total study time ‚Äî that‚Äôs **WAY** too much.  
I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that the key to learning a language is INPUT : **listening and reading.**

When I changed my learning method, I quickly noticed a difference: my brain started recognizing and using words more easily, and I think it is linked to the fact that I have **heard and read them so many times in different contexts.** Plus, I think it gives a nice boost in fluency and pronouciation.  
This approach feels much more effective than memorizing flashcards. I initially leaned on flashcards because they gave me a sense of control, but recognizing a written word and being able to translate it in your head is not enough. **Mastering a word** also means catching it in a phrase you hear, translate it properly depending of context. Flashcards can't train you for that ! On the other hand, allowing your brain to **absorb words through listening and reading** is, I think, more powerful. Aside from new vocabulary, I discover new meanings from words I already knew, I discover new ways of using the grammar I learned.

That said, I still use ANKI for the few stubborn words that don‚Äôt stick.

**Shadowing** is an incredible technique for absorbing a language‚Äôs rhythm and improving pronunciation. It‚Äôs really helped boost my confidence!

I want to share my thoughts about '**immersion**'. Living in Vietnam gives me access to teachers and native speakers, but hearing locals bargaining at the market or talking to each other super fast next to me at the coffee place does not help me improve. Ultimately, the real immersion is actually the **constant exposure to audio and texts that you can understand (at least a bit)**. So anyone could actually ""create"" immersion from home!

I have just under four months of classes left. My goal is to reach **B2 level** before end of the year ‚Äî it‚Äôs ambitious, but I‚Äôll keep trying!

# *Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures*     
     
## *S5E8: So Long, Saigon*     
     
## **Chapter 3: Fractured Realities**

---  

The jungle road became a memory as Mouse and Minx pressed deeper into the interior, each step leaving puddles where their boots lifted. The vines grew thicker, the trunks of old trees like twisted ribs, the canopy above blocking the worst of the rain but letting through a cool drip that tapped on Mouse‚Äôs neck like a leaky faucet with bad timing.

They had walked in silence for over an hour, the only sounds the crackle of distant loudspeakers and the hum of insects reclaiming the silence left after the failed plasma test.

Mouse‚Äôs railgun vibrated every few minutes, rattling like an old engine threatening to cough itself to death, while Minx‚Äôs quantum flicker device pulsed softly with green light from where it hung at her hip.

---

They came upon the **Quonset hut at dusk**, half-swallowed by vines, its rusted corrugated shell creaking with the weight of rain pooling on top. Jungle birds perched on the edges, feathers slick, heads tilting as Mouse and Minx approached.

A sign, hanging crooked, read in faded stenciled letters:

> **‚ÄúARPA FIELD UNIT ‚Äì ADVANCED TESTING & EVALUATION‚Äù**

Inside, light glowed faintly through plastic sheeting taped over broken windows, a sickly yellow that flickered with each power surge from the generator humming outside.

---

Mouse tried the door, but it groaned in protest, rust grinding against itself. He gave it a kick, and it opened with a squeal that made Minx wince.

They stepped into **organized chaos**.

Shelves stacked with rusted tools, old oscilloscope screens flickering, chalkboards covered in frantic equations, blueprints pinned under mugs of cold coffee. In the center of the hut stood **Professor Featherstone**, a piece of chalk in one hand, a slide rule in the other, his hair more frazzled than usual, eyes wild with the exhaustion of a man dancing on the edge of brilliance and madness.

Behind him, three blackboards filled with **layered prototype schematics** towered, diagrams of railgun power routes, energy overflow buffers, failed drone designs, and rows of ‚ÄúFailure ‚Äì Failure ‚Äì Partial Success‚Äù marked in red.

He was muttering to himself:

> ‚ÄúTiered energy returns, field sustainability, redundancy without redundancy, stability, stable ‚Äì no, unreliable by design, by *necessity*‚Ä¶‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt notice Mouse and Minx at first, so they stood watching him, the rain drumming on the roof in a rhythm that was almost comforting, almost enough to drown out the tension in the air.

---

Finally, Featherstone turned, his eyes catching on Mouse, the railgun‚Äôs glow lighting his face.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre early,‚Äù Featherstone said, voice rasping from too many hours without water.

> ‚ÄúOr you‚Äôre late,‚Äù Mouse shot back, setting the railgun down with a thunk that shook the hut.

Featherstone ignored the quip, shuffling toward the blackboards, waving the chalk like a conductor.

> ‚ÄúThey want the best,‚Äù Featherstone said, his voice rising as he spoke. ‚ÄúThey always want the best, the ultimate deterrent, the perfect weapon, the thing that will finally end war. They say they want peace, but they want *their* peace, enforced by fear.‚Äù

He jabbed the chalk at the boards, diagrams of the plasma cannon, the swarm drones, the layered failsafes.

> ‚ÄúSo I give them the best,‚Äù he continued, chalk snapping in his grip, ‚Äúand the best breaks. Because it has to. Because if it *worked*‚Ä¶‚Äù

He trailed off, staring at the snapped piece of chalk in his hand.

---

Mouse tilted his head, chewing on his cigar stub, eyes narrowing as he stepped closer to the boards, scanning the equations, the sketches, the loops of failed energy cycles.

> ‚ÄúYou built it to fail,‚Äù Mouse said quietly.

Featherstone‚Äôs eyes flicked up, sharp.

> ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

> ‚ÄúYou built it to fail,‚Äù Mouse repeated, louder now, turning to face Featherstone fully. ‚ÄúAll this‚Äî‚Äù he gestured to the boards, to the chaos, to the chaos outside ‚Äú‚Äîyou made sure it could *never* work the way they wanted. Because if it did, they‚Äôd use it, and we‚Äôd all be cinders before lunch.‚Äù

Featherstone opened his mouth, but the words died before they formed, his eyes locked on Mouse.

For a moment, the rain seemed to stop, the generator‚Äôs hum the only sound.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just muscle, are you?‚Äù Featherstone said, studying Mouse with new eyes, as if seeing him for the first time.

Mouse shrugged, glancing at Minx, who was watching them both carefully.

> ‚ÄúYou live long enough in this racket,‚Äù Mouse said, his voice softer, rough around the edges, ‚Äúyou learn to see the angle. War‚Äôs not about winning, it‚Äôs about *continuing*. Best weapons end things. Second-best keeps the money flowing.‚Äù

Featherstone let out a ragged breath, a laugh that sounded more like a sob.

> ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù he said, closing his eyes. ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

---

Minx shifted, her boots scraping against the concrete.

> ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù she asked, crossing her arms.

Featherstone turned, his eyes red, but calmer now.

> ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, gesturing to a table where smaller prototypes lay in pieces, ‚Äúyou take the second-best and make sure the others can‚Äôt get them working either. Sabotage, field testing, call it what you want. I‚Äôve done what I can here, but in the field, it‚Äôs your hands that decide how this ends.‚Äù

Mouse walked over to the table, picking up a small circuit, turning it over in his fingers, the glow from the railgun reflecting in his eyes.

> ‚ÄúFunny,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúsecond-best seems like a promotion these days.‚Äù

---

Before Featherstone could respond, the door slammed open, and the **Tonight Tonights** stormed in, surf rock riff blasting from a portable speaker strapped to Jones‚Äôs chest.

Mac pointed a finger at Mouse, then at Featherstone.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a schedule, people!‚Äù Mac shouted over the music. ‚ÄúThose prototypes aren‚Äôt gonna sabotage themselves!‚Äù

Featherstone‚Äôs shoulders slumped, but a ghost of a smile played on his lips as he met Mouse‚Äôs eyes one last time.

> ‚ÄúMake it count,‚Äù he said.

Mouse nodded, slinging the railgun over his shoulder, the glow intensifying as it charged up.

> ‚ÄúI always do,‚Äù he replied.

---

Minx twisted the dial on her flicker device as the music hit a crescendo, and for a moment, reality itself seemed to skip, the flickering lights turning the hut into a strobe of rain, neon, and movement.

They moved out, Mouse and Minx stepping into the wet night, the generator‚Äôs hum following them as they disappeared back into the jungle, the rain swallowing their footprints before they could dry.

Behind them, Featherstone turned back to his blackboards, his hand resting on the snapped chalk, eyes closing as he whispered to himself:

> ‚ÄúSecond-best is the only best left.‚Äù

## **Chapter 2: Into the Monsoon**

---  

The rain was biblical.

It lashed the leaves of the jungle with machine-gun rhythm, fat drops exploding into steam on the rusted hulls of abandoned American trucks half-swallowed by vines. The mud clung to boots like it had opinions, pulling at every step, sucking down the careless and the unprepared. And there was Mouse Capone, dragging the humming railgun behind him like an unwilling mule, the glow of its capacitors flickering blue in the drowned green of the jungle.

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs pulling to the left,‚Äù Mouse complained, leaning sideways to keep the railgun balanced against his shoulder. Every few feet, it emitted a low, whale-like hum that vibrated in his bones.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a precision weapon,‚Äù Minx replied calmly, striding ahead, her boots barely sinking into the mud, the quantum flicker device strapped to her belt and pulsing softly with a patient glow. ‚ÄúTry being precise.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be precise about how much I hate this thing,‚Äù Mouse grunted, shifting the car battery strapped to his back, the cables rattling like dry bones.

They were following an overgrown trail marked by half-buried French milestones, the numbers eroded by rain and time, each marker leaning like a drunk against the jungle‚Äôs suffocating embrace. The air smelled of wet leaves, gun oil, and the deep, fungal sweetness of decay.

Somewhere in the trees above, a monkey screamed. Somewhere else, a helicopter thumped by, the sound distant, disconnected, as if the war outside was just another radio show drifting through the rain.

---

They weren‚Äôt alone.

Trailing behind them were two local guides, teenage brothers with straw hats and machetes, who had been paid by the CIA‚Äôs ‚Äúcultural liaison‚Äù to lead Mouse and Minx to the test site. The boys spoke in quick, nervous Vietnamese, glancing at the glowing railgun with eyes wide as plates.

Mouse turned and flashed them a grin, lifting the railgun‚Äôs barrel just enough to show it off.

> ‚ÄúGhost hunters,‚Äù one of the boys whispered to the other, crossing himself in fear.

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ghost hunters,‚Äù Mouse said, pausing to adjust the weight again. ‚ÄúUnless you count the ghosts this thing‚Äôs gonna make.‚Äù

Minx shot him a look, the flicker device now in her hand, the dial glowing brighter in the gloom. She twisted it experimentally, and for a moment, the falling rain stuttered, droplets hanging in the air like glass beads before catching up with gravity again.

The guides yelped, clutching each other, whispering prayers.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not helping,‚Äù Minx said, slipping the device back onto her belt.

> ‚ÄúThey think we‚Äôre ghosts, we‚Äôre invisible,‚Äù Mouse said, smirking, though his eyes kept scanning the tree line for movement.

---

They crested a rise and found themselves staring down into a clearing carved out of the jungle, the mud churned to soup by tank treads and boots. Makeshift towers of corrugated metal and bamboo held up speakers blaring a distorted recording of martial music and garbled announcements in English, French, and Vietnamese.

In the center of the clearing stood a **plasma cannon** the size of a delivery truck, perched on a steel platform that looked like it had been welded together in a panic. Technicians in rain ponchos darted around it, checking gauges and shouting over the speakers. A few CIA observers sat under a canvas awning, drinking instant coffee and scribbling notes, their eyes hidden behind mirrored sunglasses.

Mouse and Minx crouched behind a rotting log, peering at the scene.

> ‚ÄúThat the big test?‚Äù Mouse asked, wiping rain from his brow.

> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the ‚Äòbest‚Äô,‚Äù Minx replied, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúFeatherstone‚Äôs golden child.‚Äù

A countdown started over the loudspeakers, crackling through the rain: ‚ÄúBa‚Ä¶ hai‚Ä¶ m·ªôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

The plasma cannon‚Äôs coils glowed with a sickly purple light, steam rising as rain hit the superheated metal. There was a low, deep whine that set Mouse‚Äôs teeth on edge.

And then the cannon fired.

For half a heartbeat, the world turned white. The air pulsed, and a column of energy ripped into the jungle, vaporizing a swath of trees and dirt, sending up a shockwave that knocked the technicians flat and flipped over a supply truck like a toy. The smell of ozone and burned earth cut through the rain.

Then the cannon exploded.

Purple lightning arced across the clearing as the weapon melted down on its own platform, superheated metal flowing like lava, igniting the awning where the CIA observers were scrambling to get out of the way.

Mouse and Minx watched in silence as chaos unfolded.

> ‚ÄúEffective,‚Äù Mouse said after a moment. ‚ÄúFor a one-time use.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they call the ‚Äòbest‚Äô,‚Äù Minx replied, her voice dry.

> ‚ÄúGlad we got the second-best,‚Äù Mouse said, shifting the railgun‚Äôs weight. It chose that moment to let out another deep hum, vibrating so hard his teeth chattered. ‚ÄúMostly.‚Äù

---

They waited until the chaos calmed, the rain doing its best to put out the small fires smoldering in the mud. Technicians picked through the wreckage, arguing, pointing at melted instruments, taking photographs. A medic was tending to a man with burned eyebrows who kept insisting it was just a test run.

Mouse and Minx slipped away, moving deeper into the jungle.

---

The deeper they went, the thicker the rain became, until it felt like moving through a warm, endless shower, the drops heavy enough to sting where they hit bare skin. The world smelled of wet metal and rotting leaves, and every step squelched.

Minx paused under a tree, checking the flicker device again, turning the dial carefully. For a moment, Mouse saw her reflection fracture in the green glow, her image split into a dozen shards before merging back into one. She looked tired.

> ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù Mouse asked, his voice lower now, the sarcasm stripped away by the rain.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ wasteful,‚Äù she said softly, eyes on the dial. ‚ÄúAll of it.‚Äù

Mouse nodded, adjusting the railgun again, looking out into the rain.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a living,‚Äù he said, but it didn‚Äôt sound like a joke this time.

---

They found shelter under the shattered roof of what had once been a French colonial outpost, the plaster walls cracked, vines crawling in through broken windows. Mouse set the railgun down carefully, the glow lighting up the room like a ghostly lantern, the blue reflected in puddles on the floor.

Minx sat on a broken crate, checking the flicker device, her hair dripping, her eyes distant.

> ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to keep testing,‚Äù she said.

> ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre gonna keep cleaning up,‚Äù Mouse replied, slumping against the wall.

They shared a moment of quiet, the rain drumming above them, the flicker device pulsing softly in the gloom.

> ‚ÄúSecond-best isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù Mouse said after a moment, watching the glow. ‚ÄúMeans you live to see tomorrow.‚Äù

Minx looked at him, a small, tired smile crossing her lips.

> ‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù she said.

---

Outside, the rain kept falling, washing the smoke and the ashes away, the jungle reclaiming the scars as quickly as they were made.

The test had failed. But the war would go on.

And Mouse and Minx, with their second-best weapons, would walk deeper into the green, into the monsoon, toward whatever disaster the next dawn would bring.

We loved the flavor and crema from our Jura J80, so I'd want to at least have that met with an equivalent with whatever we get.

I do love iced coffee, though, so am intrigued by the Dinamica Plus' offering of that--anyone have any experience with it to speak to the quality and whether it's worth using the machine vs making my own iced coffee from a regular shot?

It looks like if I wanted that feature on a Jura it's only in two models, and we'd now be way over my budget to get that in a Jura.

I've read a bunch of the posts on here already for Jura vs. DeLonghi, but there's nothing close to consensus so figured I post my more specific questions here. The Jura we have is now dead-dead, so need to replace with something regardless.

1lp1gam,https://www.reddit.com/r/inArcDesigns/comments/1lp1gam/interior_design_for_traditional_south_indian/,Interior Design for Traditional South Indian Homes: Blending Heritage with Modern Living,"[Interior Designers in Hyderabad](https://preview.redd.it/76e6004mj9af1.jpg?width=940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=831d33314857778a8fce344869d886d89c42a95c)

South Indian homes have always had a charm of their own‚Äîthink carved wooden doors, red oxide floors, brass lamps, and the comforting scent of sandalwood wafting through the air. But as lifestyles evolve and cities grow busier, many homeowners are now looking for ways to blend that timeless heritage with the convenience and style of modern living.

If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of having a home that feels like your grandmother‚Äôs courtyard but with a sleek modular kitchen tucked in the corner‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. Let‚Äôs explore how to bring the best of both worlds together in your interiors.

# ü™µ 1. Start with the Soul: Wood, Wood, and More Wood

Traditional South Indian homes are practically love letters to wood. From rosewood swings to teak pillars, wood brings warmth, elegance, and a sense of rootedness. You don‚Äôt need a palace to pull this off‚Äîjust a few key elements like:

* A carved wooden pooja unit
* A low wooden diwan with cotton cushions
* Wooden ceiling beams or paneling for that rustic touch

Pair these with neutral walls and modern lighting, and you‚Äôve got a space that feels both grounded and fresh.

# ü™î 2. Let There Be (Brass) Light

Brass is more than just a metal‚Äîit‚Äôs a vibe. Traditional South Indian homes often feature brass lamps (like the iconic *vilakku*) and *urlis* filled with water and flowers. These pieces not only add a golden glow but also connect your space to cultural rituals and festive warmth.

Modern twist? Use brass pendant lights or wall sconces with clean lines. They nod to tradition without feeling dated.

# üè° 3. Courtyard Feels in Compact Spaces

Not everyone has the luxury of a central courtyard (*mutram*), but you can still recreate that open, airy feeling. Try:

* Skylights or sunroofs to bring in natural light
* Indoor plants like areca palms or tulsi in terracotta pots
* A small water feature or a swing (*oonjal*) in the living room

Even a cozy balcony can become your mini courtyard with the right elements.

# üé® 4. Color Me Classic

South Indian interiors love earthy tones‚Äîterracotta, mustard yellow, deep reds, and leafy greens. These colors reflect the region‚Äôs natural palette and look stunning when paired with white or beige walls.

Want to modernize it? Use these shades as accents‚Äîlike a mustard sofa, a red oxide floor, or green kitchen tiles‚Äîwhile keeping the rest of the space light and airy.

# üßµ 5. Textiles That Tell Stories

From *Kalamkari* wall hangings to *Chettinad* cotton curtains, South Indian textiles are rich in texture and tradition. Use them to add softness and soul to your interiors:

* Handloom cushion covers
* Block-printed table runners
* Woven dhurries or rugs

Mix them with modern upholstery or minimalist furniture for a balanced look.

# ü™ë 6. Furniture: Low, Lean, and Lovely

Traditional South Indian furniture tends to be low-slung and sturdy‚Äîperfect for lounging with a cup of filter coffee. Think:

* Wooden cots with cane backs
* Floor seating with bolsters
* Simple wooden dining tables with carved legs

To modernize, pair these with sleek chairs or add a glass tabletop for contrast.

# üñºÔ∏è 7. Art and Accessories with a Local Touch

Skip the generic wall art and go for pieces that reflect your roots:

* Tanjore paintings or Mysore art
* Brass bells, temple mirrors, or antique locks
* Clay figurines or hand-painted tiles

These small touches add character and make your home feel uniquely yours.

# Final Thoughts

Blending heritage with modern living isn‚Äôt about choosing one over the other‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a space that tells your story. A home where your grandmother‚Äôs swing sits comfortably next to your smart TV. Where brass lamps glow beside sleek pendant lights. Where tradition isn‚Äôt just preserved‚Äîit‚Äôs celebrated.

So whether you‚Äôre renovating an ancestral home or designing a new apartment with a traditional twist, remember: it‚Äôs all about balance, intention, and a little bit of heart.

Residents commute to work, truck drivers haul goods and families embark on road trips.

But as the cars push through congested lanes like blood pulsing through veins, the real heartbeat of I-70 is found in the communities just off the road. 

Shops passed down through generations. Neighbors banding together after disaster. Carnival rides traveling across the state for county fairs. Coffee shops turning customers into family, and hatcheries protecting vulnerable species.

As thousands of drivers traverse the interstate, these stories are just an exit ramp away.

As the travelers on the roadway reaches capacity, the Missouri Department of Transportation has embarked on a multi-year project to improve the interstate. The expansion, which includes adding an additional lane in each direction, has already begun between Kingdom City and Columbia, and the project is slated to be completed in 2030. The new lanes are expected to improve traffic flow, modernize infrastructure and ""provide expanded employment opportunities to a diverse workforce,"" according to MoDOT. 

While residents across the state prepare to endure five more years of road construction, the Missourian visuals staff turned their attention to these communities and stories just off the interstate.

The Missourian presents, ""The Pulse of I-70,"" a collection of photo stories and micro documentaries showcasing these stories. 

To see each story, you may use the interactive map or click on the images. Check back weekly for additional stories.

Well here goes nothing! Hey, my name is Nathaniel, and I‚Äôm a 26-year-old lonely Christian walking a journey of healing and redemption. To start off, I‚Äôd like to share a bit about my faith and the bumpy road I‚Äôve walked in my journey walking with Christ. I am a born again follower of Jesus, and I have been walking with Him my whole life. I grew up going to church, but didn‚Äôt fully know Jesus or his nature until about 4 years ago when I decided on a very tearful night driving home that I needed Jesus more than I knew. I gave my life to him that night. But even though I gave my life to Him doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt had bumps in the road. I am a very honest guy, and I believe telling the truth and being upfront early is always the right move. With that said my journey with Christ has been riddled with temptation, heartbreak, and loneliness. All of these are a part of my story, but so has the grace of God. I believe with all my heart that God can use even our brokenness to bring something beautiful. Yes, I will admit I struggled with lust, but I have been redeemed, and by the grace of God have managed to remain celibate for my entire life. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm not here to pretend I‚Äôm perfect. I‚Äôve made mistakes, I‚Äôve battled through seasons of isolation, and I‚Äôve had my heart crushed more than once. But I‚Äôm still standing. Still growing. Still becoming the man I believe God wants me to be‚Äîone who leads in love, serves with strength, and lives with intention.

I went to college for two years and earned a degree in Gunsmithing and Weapons Design & Technology. Now I work as a professional Master Gunsmith‚Äîa job I‚Äôm incredibly passionate about. I spend most of my days building, restoring, and working hands-on with the tools and trade I love.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a big-time sci-fi nerd, a gamer, and a lifelong LEGO builder. I love the outdoors, especially when it involves good weather, good coffee, and fresh air. I work on cars, shoot guns at the range, and can talk about history, Star Wars, Star Trek, Westerns, or Transformers for way too long if you let me. üòÇ

I‚Äôm looking for a godly woman who is emotionally mature, spiritually grounded, and ready to pursue something lasting and real. Someone who values truth over trends, faith over filters, and grace over games. I believe marriage is a covenant‚Äînot just chemistry‚Äîand I want to find someone to build that life with. Someone who will walk beside me, not fix me. And I‚Äôll do the same for her.

If you‚Äôre done with shallow, done with flaky, and ready for something deeper and more honest‚Äîmessage me. I‚Äôm not flashy, I‚Äôm not famous, I‚Äôm not rich, but I am a man who is constantly trying to build himself up and make the best out of everything, and I am doing it all through being faithful that God will provide and has my best interests in mind. I pray for the right woman to read this and recognize the heart behind it. I constantly pray for the woman God has for me, and pray for her path to be blessed and her path to be lit by the light of the Lord Jesus.

Let‚Äôs see where this road might lead, with God lighting the way. Please reach out if you are interested.

1lp19nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingAU/comments/1lp19nm/an_amazing_placement_experience_is_the_culture/,An amazing placement experience - is the culture changing?,"Hi everyone! I'm a second-year nursing student and I've just finished my first ever hospital placement at a large teaching hospital in Perth, WA. I had already done three pracs, all in aged care homes - I had just over 360 hours of aged care under my belt before moving onto hospitals. I'm not saying that my aged care placements were terrible experiences, because they weren't. The staff were mostly nice enough, and I learnt all the basics easily enough. But that didn't stop me from somewhat dreading the prac period, and when I was at prac, I was simply waiting to go home. I was counting down the days until my prac block ended. At some point I was questioning whether I even wanted to do nursing. The aged care work was boring, strenuous, and thankless. It's not fun having a demented resident screaming profanities at you and trying to bite your arm when you're just trying to give them a shower. 

  
After I finished the first day of the hospital placement though, I was absolutely blown away. *Every* nurse on the ward I was assigned to was friendly, patient, and eager to teach us students new skills. We had more opportunities to learn new things than I ever could have dreamed - I was half-expecting that we'd only get to do the compulsory skills set out by the uni. I feel 100x times more competent now than I did before the placement. Our clinical facilitator - she belonged to the hospital, not the uni - was so lovely and caring (I'd even go so far as to describe her as *motherly*), she'd regularly ""check in"" on us, we'd joke around a lot, and sometimes we'd even grab a coffee from the hospital cafe as a group - like a mother duck leading her ducklings around the pond. 

  
The whole experience was so good in fact, that our entire group (six of us students) signed a card together and brought a bunch of chocolates in for our facilitator and all the nurses on the ward on our final day. I was actually somewhat sad that the prac had ended.

  
This is the polar opposite to what I was expecting. On my second-ever placement, I was warned by two different nurses that when I got to hospital pracs, I will encounter grumpy, rude nurses who wanted nothing to do with students. I was basically told to prepare to be treated like shit and that I had to be ready to take that. Essentially that *nurses eat their young*. And I walked in to the hospital fully believing that was what was going to happen.

  
While I don't doubt that horizontal violence is the norm in many places, I can't help but think the culture may be slowly changing. Perhaps I did get super lucky to get placed in a friendly ward, but I have yet to experience flat-out meanness by an RN or an EN on prac. Unfriendliness or lack of enthusiasm towards students, sure, but I imagine that's because precepting is hard work. I can absolutely picture clocking in to your shift already in a bad mood, having to care for four super needy patients, *and* you have a student to look after. It'd be the cherry on top to make your shift hell. I don't think unfriendliness towards students is necessarily personal.

Since that time I've learned a lot about WoW Addons and it's been quite a bit of work. Thankfully I got a lot of help from the community and the Addon has been regularly updated throughout all of Cata. The undertaking seems to have been a success and I hope to continue this for Mists, as we go into yet another expansion.

By now, I've got most things figured out and hopefully this expansion won't be as much work. However, I can still use some help for anyone who cares to beautify the data or add improvements. I have written some scripts to automate a good chunk of the work, but making the loot tables nice and presentable still need a human hand, as well as other small tweaks here there.

For Mists, I still got a good amount of work to do. In Blizzard fashion, I will release a ""Beta"" version (not really ready, but whatever) later today that should have most of the data in there for pre-patch, but there will be updates! Any errors or bugs can be posted on Github (that aren't already on the TODO list) @ [https://github.com/snowflame0/AtlasLootClassic\_MoP/issues](https://github.com/snowflame0/AtlasLootClassic_MoP/issues)¬†

**Releases will continue to be on CurseForge @**

[**https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic-mists**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic-mists)

If you don't get an automatic update soon, you might need to enable Beta downloads in your CurseForge app settings.

Many thanks to the community for being awesome and staying alive. Despite all the haters who said Classic would be over with the release of Cata, I still had a great time during Cata and I look forward to raiding again in MoP. Also special thanks to all the people over @ GitHub and Discord who have helped throughout Cata keeping the addon updated and fixing bugs.

**Finally, I kindly ask that you support me if you can** (link below). I'm still financially struggling and in dire need of new hardware (I'm still running a Intel 7th gen CPU and 1000 series nVidia GPU :/), also coffee and stuff.

These Traumas have manifested themselves inTO  Social Media addiction in particularly phone addiction (youtube,instagram,reddit)whereby i simply switch My Brain off from Thinking and feeling.I struggle to engage with basic stuff which i do enjoy like reading whereby i have to actually my Brain and learn i also have lost a desire to engage in hobbies and interests like Cycling and Cooking nice meals , it's also manifested in quite horrible Depression whereby i am simply Apathetic , not chasing any goals long term or short  , i also feel like i have repressed Emotions on this issue whereby even with a therapist i don't really  truly open up or even with Friends , on the outset there is not a big indication that i am not doing great as i will obviously engage in the societial expectations of brushing my teeth showering , exercising and  going out with Friends .

I Do want to address this and i'm not sure where to start , it's a real no go to discuss this with parents as the one time i did explain an instance where i witnessed quite a serious violent assault it felt they gave quite  an uncaring and dismissive response even when explaining the effects it had on me.I feel like explaining these Events to a friend and releasing it all in one go would be beneficial but it would also feel unfair to simply Trauma Dump on somebody like that  , funnily enough the only time i felt some semblance of relief is when me and my Friends did MDMA together and i did confess some of these Traumas , (well we all did) obviously MD is not a solution to this.

Maybe a good Word to describe myself currently would be Complacent with my current mental and emotional well being.
I feel like under this damage there is still this inner child that i want back , not the immaturity side or the  ignorance of world Affairs but the eagerness to learn ,the  extroverted side , the side whereby i would order a coffee  and genuinely smile and strike up a conversation , where i would not just Brain rot.

1lp10n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lp10n7/should_you_buy_the_fellow_stagg_ekg_pro_electric/,Should You Buy the Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Kettle for Your Kitchen?,"The Fellow 1171PRO-MB is undoubtedly one of the most interesting electric kettles I've ever tried. With my daily routine involving countless cups of tea and the occasional French press coffee, an electric kettle is something I interact with multiple times a day. Naturally, this gave me an excellent opportunity to evaluate every nook and cranny of the product‚Äîboth its shining features and areas that could use some work.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing you'll notice is its beautiful matte black finish, which looks absolutely stunning on any countertop. It feels modern and sophisticated but not overly flashy. Its compact dimensions (8.74""L x 6.73""W x 8""H) make it a great choice for apartments or smaller kitchen spaces. The kettle feels solid with its 304 stainless steel body, which ensures durability, and the ergonomic handle provides excellent grip even when it‚Äôs filled to its 0.9-liter capacity. My favorite touch: the optional wooden accents, which add a hint of charm.

**Performance and Heating Capability**

Let me just say‚Äîthis kettle's speedy heating element is impressive. Whether I needed 180¬∞F for green tea or 205¬∞F for my French press, the precise temperature control never let me down. I was genuinely amazed by the precision it offered; the high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to monitor and adjust settings on the fly. No more guessing if the temperature is ‚Äúclose enough‚Äù! It‚Äôs tailored to perfection.

**Advantages**

- The minimalist yet sharp matte black finish elevates the overall aesthetic.
- Sturdy build with food-grade materials ensuring top-tier durability.
- Easy-to-use LCD interface simplifies temperature adjustments.
  
[Check the Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0bz59157h/)

**Ease of Use and Customization Options**

What sets this electric kettle apart from others I've used are its customizable options. I enjoyed tailoring different settings, like scheduling boils or utilizing the ‚Äúhold mode‚Äù to keep the water at the desired temperature post-boil. The altitude adjustments, chime customization, and even the clock settings were nice surprises, making this kettle feel more like an assistant built for my morning routine. The full-color display added an intuitive touch, making navigating between features a breeze.

**Negatives**

- The 0.9-liter capacity might feel a bit limiting for those who brew in larger batches.
- Regular cleaning is necessary to manage mineral deposits; they do appear relatively quickly.

**Pouring and Usability**

Pouring feels incredibly smooth, thanks to the wide spout design. Whether it was tea or hot water for oatmeal, I loved the controlled flow I had for every use. The ergonomic handle deserves a special mention here; no awkward hand placements or wrist strains whatsoever! The process felt precise and natural each time.

**Competing Products**

I have to say, when stacking the Fellow 1171PRO-MB against peers like the Bonavita 1L Variable Temperature Kettle or the COSORI Electric Gooseneck model, its standout feature is its blend of functionality and design. The others certainly heat water well, but their aesthetics and ease of customization don‚Äôt come close. That said, Bonavita‚Äôs 1-liter capacity slightly trumps this kettle if volume is your main concern. The COSORI comes at a more budget-friendly price point, but its build quality feels somewhat less polished.

**Value for Money**

While the price might seem a bit on the upper side, I truly felt like it was justified after weeks of use. The precision controls, tailored usability features, and premium build give it an edge over standard electric kettles in the market. If you‚Äôre serious about coffee or tea brewing, this kettle makes every penny worthwhile.

1lp0x98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1lp0x98/if_you_want_to_do_a_film_course_in_poly_i_urge/,"If you want to do a film course in poly, i urge you to THINK AGAIN.","I was a poly film graduate a few years ago and ever since then, I regret that decision every single day of my life. To clear any questions, I won‚Äôt disclose which poly course and which batch I was from. 

But the film and media industry in Singapore is the same almost everywhere, and through my 3 years of schooling, internship, and side gigs I did during school and after graduation, I am here to WARN any interested prospective students who wish to pursue a film course after secondary school. If you‚Äôre interested because you‚Äôre ‚Äúpassionate about film‚Äù and ‚Äúwant to contribute to the small arts scene in SG‚Äù, think through your decision again after reading this post. This is what my sec 4 self wished he knew before enrolling there years ago.

You will be hit with the reality of how low-paying this industry is. SG‚Äôs film industry is extremely small and very niche. Job market is very saturated. It‚Äôs difficult to get a stable job. Even with a poly diploma, most people end up as a freelancer in whatever role they specialise in (lighting grip, camera assist, production assistant, etc.), and most of the time, it‚Äôs hard to get gigs unless you have many connections. Even if you are a staff under a company, your salary will be comparable, or even lower than that of a full-time barista. You will struggle with finances in this industry, and climbing up the career ladder is extremely slow and imo, not worth it at all.

Moreover, while you‚Äôre in school, you have to fork out your own money to contribute to SCHOOL film projects. This applies to many poly film courses. Mine didn‚Äôt provide majority of the costs, aside from suggesting possible sponsorships only. Due to my course‚Äôs packed timetable and my own outside commitments, it was difficult to get a flexible part-time job, so I always had to approach my parents in shame for money to fund my project. During my Final Year Project, I had to fork out 1.2k from my savings from internship, and I had no choice as everyone else was contributing the same. If you and your parents are well-off, this might not be a problem for you. But to those who are not, or are borderline financially comfortable, I urge you to think twice. 

Many creative restrictions and artistic freedom in both the industry and maybe that film course you‚Äôll enrol into. People don‚Äôt realise it unless they work in SG‚Äôs film industry, but there‚Äôs a lot of strict censorship by IMDA about what media people can produce locally. Even in school, they won‚Äôt pick stories revolving around controversial themes. 

If you want to make a film about politics, religion, or LGBTQ, etc., sure. But 99% of the time, no company or organisation will sponsor your film any money and it will remain as a passion project. You‚Äôll be back to square one again: forking out your own money. Passion projects are good for experience and fun with friends, but to develop your career in the actual industry? Not so much. As entry-level film graduates who want to be independent, you‚Äôll solely rely on sponsorships and collabs the first few years. That means writing stories based on the rules given by the government. You can leave Singapore if you still want to explore your creative freedom in film elsewhere, but that would take so many years of saving up, and what if your experience will be the same overseas? Is it really worth it for you to work tirelessly for so many years but land on the same spot over and over again?

Lastly, the mental and emotional strain not a lot of people talk about for this industry. To be in film is to live and inhale film. Call times can be as early as 1-4am in the morning, with most shoots capped at 12 hours of labour. That means if call time is 5am, wrap time is 5pm. That doesn‚Äôt include tear down of equipment, props, and production stuff. So depending on the location, you could reach home at 9pm-10pm. Film shoots are usually consecutive, so next few days is repeat. Could be the same call time, could be later or earlier. Either way, this cycle will drain you. Just to hit you with reality: 3-4 days of shoot = 8 minutes of a film. 

Mind you, not all shoots will for sure end at the 12-hour mark. During my CORPORATE internship (where I did shoots for 3 weeks straight, no break no OT/weekend pay), call time would be 7am, wrap time 2am and the same every day. And you might think this is for interns or entry-level jobs. No. I‚Äôve seen experienced DOPs and Art Directors hustling real bad for all this and for what? Most of my conversations with them always ended up with them admitting that they‚Äôve lost their passion in this field and they just have to do it because it‚Äôs the only job they can have with their qualifications. Also, I realised that many of these experienced people in the industry have this ‚ÄúI hate my job‚Äù face and attitude. They do not like their life at all. And they treat other people in the crew like shit. Do you really want to spend years of your life with this miserable cycle every day?

Especially if you‚Äôre a student intern/entry-level, people above you like your supervisor and boss will not hesitate to throw whatever ad-hoc tasks to you on set, despite having a specific job you‚Äôre paid for. For eg, during one of my side gigs, I was paid to be a lighting grip, but as I was one of the younger and less experienced crew members there, I was suddenly thrown in as a production assistant halfway, fanning talents and buying everyone their morning coffees. And you‚Äôre not allowed to complain as how it works is extremely hierarchical. They don‚Äôt care much about the well-being or mental health of the staff at the bottom of the ‚Äúfood chain‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not the Director or DOP, you‚Äôre treated like dogshit or don‚Äôt acknowledge you most of the time and you can‚Äôt complain. 

Moreover, while you‚Äôre in school, be expected to have majority toxic classmates in your batch. I‚Äôve seen my own friends turn into suck-ups to lecturers, to ITE FLM graduates who have more experience, popular kids, and more. If you know you‚Äôre an introvert, don‚Äôt even bother going into this field. Film revolves around connections, and if it‚Äôs difficult for you to keep up social interactions/prefer to have fewer but genuine friends, this is not for you. Most people in film and media only approach you for ulterior motives (like more connections, gaining more experience) and not because they genuinely want to be your friend. Many of them WILL turn their backs/betray you soon enough.

Although of course this is not the case all the time. I‚Äôve met a couple of people from my poly who are still my lifelong friends til today. But my overall experience in my film course is still bad and not worth it. Also another thing is that if you mess up in a school project (and it‚Äôs most likely because you‚Äôre learning and still making mistakes which is obviously what school is for), batchmates will tend to ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù you. Meaning, rumours spread like wildfire and no one wants to group with you for future projects anymore. It‚Äôs also easy for people to gang up on you and berate you in their peer assessments, which affects your grades. Idk for other polys, but the lecturers for mine only hear out the majority‚Äôs side and penalises the ‚Äúblacklisted‚Äù person. I saw it happen to my own friend, a genuine person who made his fair share of mistakes but really wanted to learn and grow. But if you thrive from this sort of environment, and you‚Äôre an outgoing extrovert who gets along well with everyone, you might be fit for it. 

Again, this post is just a warning for prospective students who want to do film. Not just in poly, but in university as well. You don‚Äôt even need a diploma or degree in film. Most of the stuff taught are soft skills and technical skills you can learn from YouTube üò≠ It‚Äôs better to do something more useful like business courses such as HR, data analytics, or maybe even comms if you still want to be in the media sector. I‚Äôve had many batch mates pivot to other fields in uni or ended up in retail/F&B after graduation as many believed film is not worth it at all.

Idk for you, but I believe that getting a diploma in film is a waste of time, money and effort. I urge you to think more thoroughly about it. But again, it‚Äôs your choice to decide what‚Äôs best for you and your future.

**üïí Time of Test: 2:00 PM**  
This was *not* a quiet time to take a test. It was right during school run hours ‚Äî kids everywhere, parents double parked, traffic building up, and we even had to drive down an active school road. It was packed, chaotic, and honestly a real-world stress test.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Yes, I Drew on My Hands ‚Äî And No, the Examiner Doesn‚Äôt Care

Let me be real with you ‚Äî I **wrote stuff all over my hands**.

* **‚ÄúL‚Äù and ‚ÄúR‚Äù** on my thumbs (Left and Right).
* Speed limits like **30 / 20 / 40**.
* A reminder to **check mirrors**, **breathe**, and **slow at junctions**.
* ALL THE SIGNS with a sharpie 

Was it pretty? YES.  
Was it allowed? 100%.  
Did the examiner care? **Not at all.**

You're not being tested on whether your hands are clean. You're being tested on whether you're safe, aware, and in control. If writing a few helpful reminders on your hand keeps you calm and sharp, **do it**. No one's going to stop the test and say, ‚ÄúWait, is that a biro on your thumb?‚Äù

It‚Äôs not cheating. It‚Äôs called being prepared.

I wasn‚Äôt trying to be slick or pretend I had it all memorized. I used every tool I needed to stay in control ‚Äî and it worked.

If something helps you pass, **use it**.  
Markers wash off. Failing doesn‚Äôt.

# üîç The Test Breakdown:

* **Test length**: About 35 minutes of sat nav driving, followed by 2 minutes of independent driving with verbal directions back to the test centre.
* **Car used**: Automatic with cameras and parking sensors.
* **Manoeuvre**: Pull up on the right, reverse back two car lengths. I had to perform this with cars coming from both directions ‚Äî not ideal, but I handled it.

# üöó Pre-Test: Show Me / Tell Me

The examiner asked me an ‚Äúunder the bonnet‚Äù question at the start ‚Äî but they didn‚Äôt ask me to physically open it. Just a verbal check, and we moved on.

# üß† My Strategy: Talk Everything Out Loud

From the very beginning, I told the examiner:

They agreed. And from then on, I treated the drive like a narrated checklist:

* ‚Äú6-point check complete.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCentre mirror, left mirror ‚Äî indicator on.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúRoad speed is 30mph ‚Äî zebra crossing ahead, slowing down.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCentre mirror, right mirror ‚Äî speed limit changes to 20mph.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúApproaching 40mph road, heavy traffic, we‚Äôll only enter when it‚Äôs completely clear.‚Äù

Yes, I spoke out everything. It may have sounded a bit excessive, but it kept me focused, and honestly, I think the examiner appreciated how intentional and self-aware I was. Around 20 minutes in, I felt like he had already decided to pass me ‚Äî I was doing more mirror checks and assessments than he probably expected.

# üéØ Manoeuvre Under Pressure

During the pull-up and reverse, cars were coming from both directions. I calmly announced:

Everything was under control, and I kept the commentary going so there was no doubt about my awareness.

# üõ£Ô∏è Fast Road Moment

We went onto a dual carriageway with a 70mph limit. I smoothly accelerated and held it right at 69mph. Not over, not under ‚Äî just in control and safe.

# ‚úÖ The Finish ‚Äî No Debrief!

At the end of the test, the examiner said:

And that was it. No full debrief, no long explanation. He spent about 3 minutes with me, handed me the certificate, and was gone. Faster than fast.

üçå **The Banana Method (Don‚Äôt Argue ‚Äî It Works)**

I don‚Äôt care what anyone says ‚Äî this *works*.  
About **45 minutes before my test**, I ate **one banana**. That‚Äôs it. No Red Bull. No coffee. No sugar. Just a single, humble banana.

And let me tell you:

* My energy? **Perfect.**
* My nerves? **Gone.**
* My focus? **Sharp.**
* My brain? **Online.**

You can say whatever you want, but anything negative about this is pure nonsense. This isn‚Äôt a guess. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù This is **100,000% effective**.

So if you‚Äôve got a test coming up, forget the nonsense. Just eat a banana.  
Not two. **One.** Trust the system.  
No crashes, no shakes, no brain fog. Just smooth, stable driving energy.

üß© Final Thoughts

What passed me? Honestly ‚Äî **communication and control**.

I wasn‚Äôt trying to be overly confident or flashy. I just showed that I was 100% focused, that I understood the road, and that I was thinking ahead the whole time.

So if you're preparing for your test:

* **Communicate everything.**
* **Be intentional with every move.**
* **Show you‚Äôre in control ‚Äî not just physically but mentally too.**
* **They can't read your mind but they can read your mind if you tell them ......... ;)**

Even in the middle of school traffic chaos, I kept it together. And it worked.",2,1751374311.0,LearnerDriverUK,23,0.52,False

1lp0tv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lp0tv1/im_done_looking_for_a_job/,I‚Äôm done looking for a job.,"For full context: I'm a graphic designer, artist, and aspiring developer. I've been actively drawing for the past nine years. I have a master's degree in graphic design. I got top marks for both my bachelor's and master's theses. Overall, my GPA was excellent. I ranked among the top 500 out of 14,000 students at my university.

And yet, I never found a job.

My first attempts started three years ago, right after I finished my bachelor's. I already knew I didn‚Äôt want to go into a master‚Äôs program. I saw it as a waste of time (which turned out to be partially true for me, though only partially, since it was during my master‚Äôs that I finally had the time to realize I wanted to pursue solo game development). But back then, I was looking for work. In about eight months, I sent out over 300 applications and cover letters to local jobs and international ones alike. After all, what difference does it make where I live if I have all the skills and equipment needed to work remotely?

But nothing happened.

I understand why, to some extent, my portfolio back then was relatively weak; I was at a junior level. But still, it was a level. Nobody comes out of university as a senior. Then came a break. I started my master‚Äôs, earned my degree, and now I‚Äôm back on these job sites, scraping by with occasional freelance work. But now my portfolio is much stronger, and I‚Äôm more than confident in it. 

And now it‚Äôs been almost exactly a year since I started dedicating at least an hour every single day to job hunting, pouring myself into it entirely.

And still nothing.

I‚Äôve sent out over 400 applications. Around 90% ended in ghosting. I‚Äôve called companies that had job listings, only to be turned down for all sorts of reasons: from ‚Äúwe already have enough candidates‚Äù to ‚Äúthat position hasn‚Äôt been open for weeks.‚Äù I got lucky once I was invited to an interview. After our discussion, they told me they'd think it over for a week and asked me to call them back. When I did, they acted like the conversation had never happened and said they already hired someone.

And then there were the test tasks. About 50 of them. Unpaid, of course. I spent hours of my life on those, only to get absolutely nothing back after submitting them, not even a single line of feedback from the recruiters. And I‚Äôm not talking about simple projects that take 3‚Äì5 hours. These were often full-fledged projects that took a minimum of seven days of concentrated effort.

I‚Äôve written about this particular case before. I said I found it almost funny. But in truth, it still deeply depresses me. I spent 41 days in talks with a very large company. I created eight illustrations for them. In the end, they hired someone who traced famous paintings. Most likely, they just used me to drive down that person‚Äôs salary.

I can honestly say: I‚Äôm exhausted.

And I‚Äôm done with this pointless parade of groveling before recruiters and employers. I‚Äôm tired of seeing my work ignored. I‚Äôm tired of waiting for some HR to finish their coffee and deign to send me another AI-generated rejection because they, *not anyone from my actual field*, decided I wasn‚Äôt a good fit. I‚Äôm tired of pretending I have any respect left for them.

I‚Äôm done looking for a job.

1lp0tqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lp0tqa/breaking_up_with_my_safe_foods/,Breaking up with my safe foods.,"Dear all,   
I hope that you're doing well. 

This is my first time posting here, and I couldn't decide on which flair to choose. My post is a mix between a vent/rant and diet, but I felt Diet and exercise fit more. 

I love fries, but it was more like an obsession. From the age of 8, I refused to eat anything other than fries and another food that I hyperfixated on for a while, then started to hate. However, fries withstood the test of time. For years, I would only eat fries and chocolate milk; then, the thought of chocolate milk would make me nauseous, so I switched to fries and mangos, and so on. 

It was purely fries, not even condiments, just fries alone and dry. I was severely underweight growing up. Until my early 20s, I started to explore more foods. I liked fried chicken, some types of burgers, but I always needed to have fries every day to feel like I actually ate. As I grew (in age and size), my appetite grew, and the amount of fries I ate increased. 

Today, I'm not obese, but slightly overweight. My issue is not weight. My issue is that I have very high LDL cholesterol and hs-CRP. Both sides of my family have a history of cardiovascular disease. I didn't take that seriously for a while, but now, today, my brain processed that. 

I'm truly trying not to cry, but I made a decision to minimize fries from my diet. 

I'm writing this just because I need to say this out loud somewhere. Saying this to my family will only incur ""told you so""s and comments of how ""pretty"" I was when I was underweight. And writing this and sharing with people makes me realize that this is real and helps me with accountability.

My plan is to put some rules to make life easier. I recognize that cutting fries out of no where will be unrealistic and will shock the system I have. 

If I'm going to have fries, then I have to eat a whole green apple and drink 500ml of water beforehand. 

I have to walk 6k steps a day, minimum, and 7k for the days I eat fries.

More green tea instead of coffee. 

More water overall. 

This post really helps me realize, and if you are in a similar place, having only eaten one food for a very long period of your life. I hope this encourages you to venture and try new things and not reach where I'm here. 

Thank you for reading. 

Best,

My girlfriend and I started dating in the middle of March 2023, while I was a senior and she was a junior in high school. We are still together after 2 years, but I am in university in our home state and she is in the Navy, stationed in California.

She came back home for a couple weeks in April this year and we hung out a lot. Towards the end of the 2 weeks, I came over to her house and we hung out together in her living room. She ended up having to go to the bathroom and left her phone unlocked on the coffee table. She had always been really secretive with her phone, but I had never suspected her of cheating. I always just thought she had some embarrassing stuff that she did not want me to see.

Although I probably shouldn‚Äôt have, I decided to look through it. I went into her Instagram messages, and below me and a couple of her friends, I saw that she had been messaging this guy (23m) 2 weeks ago. My girlfriend has previously told me about him, he was from the UK and she used to talk to him and send him nudes before we started dating. I‚Äôll admit it, this guy is way better looking than me and in way better shape than me.

The more recent messages were just them talking about what had been going on in their lives recently, just catching up with each other. Nothing suspicious found there. I decided to continue to scroll up to December 23, 2023, where I found that he had texted her out of the blue. The texts before that were in 2022, so it had been a while since they had talked. It started casually, talking about how they have been doing. Then he mentions something along the lines of how he misses her nice body and wants to see some pictures. 

She agrees and sends some nudes to him, ALL of them in my own room while I‚Äôm not there. I decided not to look past those messages since they were before we started dating. This sort of gave me a heavy feeling in my stomach, but I decided to push it down since my girlfriend had been through a lot at this point with the Navy and came back home to relax. I didn‚Äôt want to put any burden on her, especially since it was a long time ago.

Ever since then, it has really been hanging on my mind. In the middle of June, I decided to confront her about it and at first she said I was delusional and she never did that. I told her to go look back at her messages with the guy and she acted surprised and said ‚ÄúOhhh, I did do that!‚Äù Then, she said it‚Äôs not that big of a deal because it was early in our relationship and she didn‚Äôt think we would last this long. She said she wasn‚Äôt sorry for doing it, but she was sorry that I felt some type of way about it, which kind of ticked me off.

Is 9 months considered not that long for a relationship? I thought that we had a strong relationship at that point, especially since we had a tough conversation about whether or not we should stay together since I was going to university. She said I should just forget about it.  Is it really not that big of a deal, and I should just move forward with our relationship?",34,1751374131.0,relationship_advice,69,0.85,False

1lp0rfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1lp0rfu/am_i_ordering_my_food_wrong_at_bakeries_and_chain/,Am I ordering my food wrong at bakeries and chain restaurants?,"So this has been a reoccurring issue and it‚Äôs making me wonder if I am the problem

For reference I do try to be nice and polite. I say some variation of ‚Äúhello, could I please get X and Y‚Äù 

I also make sure to reply if they ask how I‚Äôm doing and ask back as well. Make sure to give a smile and also sound friendly. 

I feel like my wording is clear but I feel like I am not being heard. 

Here are a few incidents I‚Äôve experienced: 

I wanted to order a blueberry muffin. They were stacked on top of each other. It was labeled ‚Äúblueberry muffins‚Äù. I asked if I could get a blueberry muffin and the lady told me they were sold out. 

Pointed at the display and asked her if the muffins in the display aren‚Äôt blueberry. She didn‚Äôt look at the display. Only at me and repeated they were sold out. Strange but I left the bakery. 

Same thing happened to me at another bakery. Asked if I could please get a croissant. Was told they didn‚Äôt have any. It was behind a counter and various croissants were displayed and lined up. 

Other people in front of me ordered but I couldn‚Äôt? They were labelled as well and I am pretty sure I know what a croissant looks like. 

Another time I went to a coffee chain. They a
have slushie coffee. It‚Äôs been on the menu for a long time. It‚Äôs my go to order. 

But half the time I get told they don‚Äôt sell that or it‚Äôs not on the menu. I have also pointed at the menu and asked for it and they tell me it‚Äôs not on the menu or they so not sell it. 

I have ordered it before so maybe the machine gets broken at times? One time I went with a friend. Tried to order but no avail. I told my friend they didn‚Äôt have it and my friend tried to order and they got it. Which again, strange. 

This happens often when I go to restaurants. The waiter comes and takes people order and goes down the table of people. I frequently get skipped and the waiter asks for the person next to me what their order is. 

My friends have had to stop the waiter because they got everyone else‚Äôs order but mine. My friends have also volunteered to order for me since this has been a reoccurring issue. Which is very kind of them and I have taken them up on the offer once in a while.  

Also when we go out to eat, I often don‚Äôt receive my food, the last one to receive it when everyone else is ready to pay, or I am given the wrong thing.

It has never happened to any of my friends when we eat out. I understand that workers are people and make mistakes but it has never happened to my friends. Sometimes I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm being singled out. It‚Äôs a bit frustrating.

I have also gone out of my way to order appetizers since those come out first and things that are easier to make on the menu just so that I can eat at the same time as everyone. It does work to an extent but it still happens

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I am maybe the problem if this keeps happening to me. 

I have tried looking back at multiple variations of these situations I have been in but I don‚Äôt think I have done anything wrong? Would like some insight from another perspective

I try to be polite when I order food. I say please and thank you. Make sure to smile. If they ask how I am, I always reply and ask back. Make small talk if they initiate it.

1lp0r3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/1lp0r3g/is_this_normal_in_toronto/,Is this normal in Toronto?,"Hi everyone, just a quick question.

I recently came to Canada and I‚Äôm working on a project. What I‚Äôve noticed and heard from others too is that the work environment feels really toxic.

People seem to backstab each other, there‚Äôs a lot of elbowing to get ahead, and there‚Äôs very little trust. Colleagues barely talk to each other, just the bare minimum, because they‚Äôre afraid things they say might be used against them later. There‚Äôs no real sense of friendship or connection like we often have in Europe, where it‚Äôs normal to grab a coffee with colleagues or even hang out with your manager sometimes.

I‚Äôm wondering has this kind of culture always existed here? Or maybe I‚Äôve just been unlucky with where I ended up? Curious to hear your thoughts or experiences.

we were coworkers, started dating. (F22/M23) two months of heaven. i have to move cities cuz of uni. i told him we should be casual cause long distance wouldn't work. he refused, he wanted us badly to date. he was working and still made time to visit me every two weeks. he was crazy about me.

**1st break up. August 15 2024**

He had been thru a lot of pressure with his family, I knew that.  
Sometimes didn‚Äôt totally respect it. He felt pressure so he asked for a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù.  
The idea of a break seemed odd to me so I vandalized his phone, called him, cried, I was pretty sure this was the end. We went thru a month, talking like once a day, very briefly asking ""how are you"". During this time he'd constantly say how much he loves me.  
Here are some Things he said during that time, which most of them were under pressure and later on he told me he didn‚Äôt mean most of it:

>*""Idk if I‚Äôm coming back and I don‚Äôt wanna keep u waiting, so if u wanna break up with me do it now that I‚Äôm already at a bad place""*

>*""I‚Äôm pressured I can‚Äôt keep thinking of things to say to continue the conversation""*

>*""No don‚Äôt come to see me it will make things worse""*

We ended up meeting up for a conversation, we said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre back together‚Äù, made love, he initiated. Same day I went to grab coffee at his place, he looks at me and says *‚ÄúI still feel like I‚Äôm lying to ur face‚Äù* I get the coffee and leave. Same day I break up with him. We ended up getting together after meeting a few times having sex, he apologies and we were brand new

**2nd break up. December 30 2024**

During the time we got back together after the first breakup I had been nonchalant as fuck, it drove him crazy.  
He goes crazy and gets paranoid so easily. Thinks im cheating, flirting with others. Anyway made him paranoid.  
I was on the edge.  
I had quit my job so I was gonna spend whole December there with him.

December 15 we had a huge fight. Not different than our typical. Ever since that fight he had been awfully quiet. Every time I‚Äôd ask him what‚Äôs wrong he‚Äôd say *‚Äúit‚Äôs not about you, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, I‚Äôm just stressed and the withdrawals from steroids is hitting me‚Äù* I believe him.  
22 December i was gonna go to another country for vacations. Before I leave, he comes in a huge storm, riding his bike, he was soaking wet just to see me. We buy snacks and sit. He sat 2hrs with wet clothes. It was winter. *‚ÄúLook how much I love u bro‚Äù* he said

During that time the fact he was quiet was upsetting. No jealousy, no anything. I kept asking, he kept saying everything is alright. I kept imagining the day when he drove in the rain to reassure myself, I told myself if he didn‚Äôt want me he would do this‚Ä¶ One time I even called him and make a joke

*‚Äúif u wanna break up with me, do it before Jan 1st‚Äù*  
he said *‚Äúu wanna start the year fresh?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúYes‚Äù*  
*‚Äúwhy would we break up? We‚Äôre fine, we‚Äôre not even fighting‚Äù*

December 30 I wake up to a paragraph. I can‚Äôt even call him cuz he‚Äôs at work. He broke up with me bc he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do it anymore‚Äù I ask him did u lose feelings? He said yes. I asked him, when? He said after our fight but I‚Äôve been trying to fix it. After more phone calls, he told me that he does still like me.  
I ask him, why did u say u didn‚Äôt? He said: *do u remember that phone call? How angry we both were?* Later on he told me the real reason he‚Äôs breaking up is because he was feeling very paranoid, he couldn‚Äôt talk to me, it was eating him up, and he caught himself having suicidal thoughts. So all he wanted was a clear mind.

We meet up in person 9 January (ironically enough it was our 1year anniversary) I cry my soul to him, literally cry and tell him everything to get him back, he told me, *‚Äúwe‚Äôre not getting back‚Äù*..  
the rest of the month went with him texting me every time I had an exam, reposting tik toks for me, and adding songs to our playlist. We were blocked on insta. He also connected messenger story‚Äôs to insta ones, and made me the only viewer so I could secretly see what he‚Äôs up to.  
My birthday, 28th January. He texted, 10 mins after 12. I get angry ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt he call‚Äù I call him, the call is tense. He was angry at me bc my reply was ‚Äúthank youuuu‚Äù, which was very pretentious of me. I end the call. I remove him from tik tok, I turn of activity status on messenger, I remove him as collaborator on the playlist.  
I sleep I wake up, still 28th of January, he had sent multiple messages and unsent them. I ask him what did u say? He said: *‚Äúlook, I understand why you remove me from Everywhere. But the playlist? Why‚Äù* I reply *‚Äúso you can keep adding songs even tho we‚Äôre not together? No thanks‚Äù*  
We end the call, I get paranoid, I text him ‚Äúblock me‚Äù he replies ‚Äúblock you?‚Äù And before I get the chance he texts again ‚Äútake care‚Äù and he blocks. We went no contact for a month.

February 24. He texts me, surprisingly I was in the same city as him. He said *‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm really sorry to bother you, I just wanted to see how you are simply because I love you‚Äù*

We meet up, it‚Äôs so amazing, he makes future plans, he‚Äôs excited. Nothing had changed. He simple came back. For a whole month we were ‚Äúseeing how this goes‚Äù no label, just vibes. And it was going great. Then we added the title. I became paranoid. I had too much free time, and I was in the same state he was back then. Fearing everything. I started thinking he could be cheating, he doesn‚Äôt care.

I go back to our hometown for a week, we barely have sex. He said he‚Äôs tired. I come back, more paranoid than ever. I call him, I start fights. He tells me I should do that bc that‚Äôs the only way this gets solved. I start thinking I should stay silent.  He cared. Any complaint i have he'd immediately fix. Always texting 24/7, always keeping me updated, i asked him to call more, he delivered. I convience my self that thus off-feeling i have is false. it wasn't

**3rd breakup. 30 June**

I have exams, my dog is dying, and my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt hype my looks up the way he used to. I call him out on it, and he finally bursts *‚ÄúListen, yes I don‚Äôt feel the same way I used to. But I‚Äôm trying to fix it. I don‚Äôt want it to end this easily‚Äù*  
I call him immediately, he explains that he has been feeling like this for 3 weeks, was trying to fix it, didn‚Äôt know how to tell me.  
First time I asked him ‚Äúwhen were u going tell me?‚Äù He said after your exam, I asked him ‚Äúwhere u gonna break up with me?‚Äù He said ‚ÄúI was just going to tell u how I feel‚Äù second time I asked the same question he replied with ‚Äúyes‚Äù, third time I asked he replied ‚Äúidk‚Äù I ended the call, after an hour, knowing it‚Äôs our last one. He wanted to block me bc he didn‚Äôt wanna see who I‚Äôd follow or anything, we didn‚Äôt even text ‚Äútake care‚Äù I told him few mins ago I HATE those messages. So we left it as it. We said I love u on call.

***IN five days our 1,5 years of long distance would finally end. He broke up before than even happened***

It's my fault for taking him back, yes, but what do you guys think. Im sad sorry if this is too much",1,1751373911.0,BreakUps,5,1.0,False

(Names to people and places have been changed)



   ""Is the reason why you don't believe in anything is because of your dad?""

    ""Yeah."" I didn't hesitate answering. It was like the answer was there all along without thought. The thinking came later.

    I had become friends with several girls since middle school, but she was different. Mandy had more empathy and talked about life. Another friend regularly asked me where I saw myself in five years, in ten years. It was a little annoying. The truth was I didn't know. I wanted to write. Write in hopes that it'll right it all. It took all my energy and effort just to get through the day. Besides writing, my friends helped me to live.

    Mandy and I were walking past the high school we used to go to. Since she lived so close to the school we would go to her house to eat and watch music videos on YouTube. Now we are both homeschooled. Today she walked to my house randomly. I was glad for the distraction.

    ""There's another thinking spot I go to sometimes. I think you'll like it. It's better than the alley,"" referencing to the alley behind her house.

    I got my shoes on and left with her. No phone, no wallet. We're 16 and it's the early 2000s.

    We walked past the water fountain downtown on the corner. Once we saw it full of soap.

    ""You want to run through the water?"" The day was already hot and only noon.

    ""Yeah, way!"" I exclaim. We both laugh. Often we make up words or mix words up. Her grandma once said that we don't even need to talk to each other. We just can grunt and understand the other person.

    ""Yeah way!? That sounds like God's name.""

    ""Yeah way...?""

    ""Uh-huh, except it's pronounced Ya Way. Y-A-H-W-A-Y. Or Jehovah.""

    ""Oh."" I couldn't put the two together. I had fun hanging out with Mandy but sometimes our conversations were confusing. (So much for understanding grunts.) She's brought up this name before. I've also spent the night before and ran into books that seemed randomly laying around the house that mentioned the name, too.

    ""You should sit in on my study sometime-no cost!"" she tagged on quickly.

    ""Ok.""

    ""You don't have to bring anything either. We can give you an extra book. You remember Monica?""

    ""I don't think so?""

    ""She used to babysit me a lot. Anyway, she conducts. She's really nice. I know you'll like her.""

    I noticed how rapidly she was talking, how fidgety Mandy was right before taking about all this study stuff. Maybe I will like it. I've always loved books.

    We walk in silence after walking through the fountain once. We crossed the street then turned down what looked like an alley that's next to a fast food restaurant.

    ""This still looks like an alley!""

    ""It's not. Trust me! We're almost there. It's kind of like Balmy Park again."" another park we go to often.

    We rounded a corner seeing long rows of two walking paths. The park is lined with pavilions along the water. We stop at one.

    ""This one is my favorite. I usually go to this one to think. What do you think, Jasmine?""

    ""I think I've been here before! I've jumped on those black floating things over there,""

    ""I don't think we're allowed on those. Unless you have a boat. Kayak.""

    Mandy suddenly began to clap her hands. The sound echoed. Then she started to sing loudly. I joined:

   ""There's a place off Ocean Avenue, where I used to sit and talk with you. We were both 16 and it felt so right. Sleeping all day, staying up all...niiiiight. Staying up all...niiiight..... IF I COULD FIND YOU NOW, THINGS WOULD GET BETTERRR. WE COULD LEAVE THIS TOWN AND RUN FOREVERRR!""

    ""We do sleep all day and stay up all night."" We laughed and started to walk again. On our way back to her house we stopped at a coffee shop where I learned that 'short' isn't apart of the name, but the size of the drink.

    Mandy's study with Monica was for the very next day. She told me it didn't matter what I wore because this was my first time going, not to be nervous, and that I can answer questions if I wanted to. Or I could just observe.

    This prep talk made me feel like I was being coached. I thought we were going to be reading a book.

    That night when Mandy was on the phone with her boyfriend I decided to lay down on the couch in the dark living room. Something was weighing heavy on my mind that Mandy and I had briefly talked about. Ever since I was little I was afraid of angels taking me away and of the thought of a hell. She told me there was no hell. If there was, it's right here on earth. No one was downstairs at the time so I thought it would be ok if I went to sleep. I heard someone walk through. It was her dad. Her whole immediate family had been inactive for a long time, she'd told me. I wasn't sure what all of that meant. Next thing I knew I was being covered up with a blanket. Then I was alone. Tears filled my eyes over the simple gesture. I fell asleep to the high-pitched voice of Mandy yelling on the phone with her boyfriend from her bedroom upstairs.

      ***

    The next morning I woke up to the smell of pancakes, eggs, and coffee. The kitchen radio was on and Frisbee the dog was barking.

    ""NO! Get Back! I love you but I need to finish making breakfast! Oh, good, you're up."" Mandy turned the volume up on the radio. I took a plate of food and sat in the second living room. Sunshine poured in the open window blinds. Frisbee followed us and decided to lock into a staring contest with me. Mandy sat, bowed her head for five seconds then said, ""You know what I just realized? Sometimes her lip gets stuck. I call it the Elvis Presley.""

    Frisbee licked her chops. Her upper lip tucked under on one side of her mouth. I laughed in my coffee cup and she went back to begging for food from me. Mandy gave Frisbee the last bite of her pancake then got up. I followed her into the kitchen where we piled our dishes in the sink.

    ""Alright. Well. Monica said she will be here in about an hour. I know you don't have to, but I'm going to start gettingt ready.""

    ""Ok."" I shrug. Mandy grabbed her book, Bible, and a highlighter then sat down in an arm chair. I quietly played with Frisbee in the other room until it was time to go.

    Monica took us back to her apartment a few blocks away. She and her husband lived in the lower part of a flat. We settled in a small room, Mandy and I on one side, Monica on the other. Monica placed mini chocolate doughnuts on the table between us then gave me a spare book that talked about everlasting life. I opened it.

    ""Mmmm, I love the smell of new books."" We all erupted in laughter. Mandy was right. Monica was nice.

    Mandy was not far in the book, but Monica took it upon herself to catch me up to speed. I tried my best to follow along, but this was all new to me. I thought I wasn't going to be called upon to do anything?
   Then I learned a new word.

   Worldly.

    In my head I was thinking that we're all worldly. We live in the world. We don't live in space. I was confused. Monica tried to help.

    ""Mandy and I aren't worldly. You're worldly because you're of the world."" She points to the window behind her. I look up. I see blue sky. ""We're not worldly."" She's pointing back and forth between her and Mandy with both hands. I'm sitting there blinking.

    ""Why don't we move on and come back to this later?"" Mandy rushed in. I kept quiet. I reached for a doughnut and got two stuck together.
    ""Ope, you got two!"" Monica laughs.

    Monica let me keep the book. Mandy told me something about her being able to count it. I was also given some magazines. When I got back home later I tossed the book in my bottom dresser drawer. I still didn't understand why this person is just met was calling me names. Or calling me something that we All are. But she made it sound like it was something dirty and wrong to be. I was automatically branded as something dirty and wrong. By a stranger. I flipped through the magazines then threw them in the trash.

    A few days later I went for another walk with Mandy.

    ""Howwww did you like the study?""

    ""Mm, I thought it was intriguing."" Intriguing was a word id just learned and I was testing it out. From the corner of my eye I saw Mandy pump her arm and hiss, ""YESsss!""

    ""I broached the topic of being insulted over name calling.

    ""Oh, she didn't mean anything by it! And you're not 'worldly'. You're just new. I'm pretty new myself even though I grew up in it.""

    I shrugged. Something still felt off.

    ""Anyway, I learned that she was talking about how she wishes I'd break up with my boyfriend.""

    ""What, why?"" I didn't like him either, but I knew him. I thought they brought out the worst in each other. What was Monica's beef?

    ""They claim it's hindering my spiritual progress.""

    ""Spiritual progress? How? It's *your* study.""

    ""They say he's a bad influence. And I shouldn't be dating right now.""

    ""That's stupid."" I didn't like any of these people. I felt like Monica didn't like me for no good reason. If her study was so intense, then what was the point?

    ""They even said I shouldn't be hanging around with you so much. You act better than most younger witnesses I know!""

    I frown.

    ""But I know it's Jehovah we need to please. We need to make God happy, not people! We're all imperfect! I just hate what they say sometimes.""

    I look up, staring straight ahead. We walk on in silence for a few minutes.

    ""So... do you want to come to my next study? You have the book now so you can prepare on your own before it.""

    ""Sure.""

    ""Ok. It's typically on Wednesday, but I've been having to have to cancel a lot and reschedule. Of course they blame it on things like me having a boyfriend... I'll let you know, ok?""

    ""Ok."" I was willing to give this another try.

That time I really wanted to start making my own matcha at home. When I tried it, I thought mali lang ako ng timpla. It was so bad LOL. You could feel the powder bits in your mouth, and it easily settled to the bottom. I did a few more tries just to get it right, following tutorials -- but it still tasted bad. Because of that, I stopped making my own matcha for months. I have been a matcha girl through and through, pero somehow that experience really made me dislike matcha tuloy hahaha. I was only able to drink matcha when I went to various coffee shops, and that was it.  I don't know why it took me so long to buy the super food grocer one, especially since it was also very popular naman na back then. 

Anyway, I finally got to try the super food grocer one already. Paired it with oatside milk, and it was like trying matcha for the first time. Fell in love with matcha again, and now I'm excited to wake up every day just to make matcha AHAHAHAHA. 

The two are very comparable. The one from super food grocer is bright green in color, while littleretailph has more of like a dull, lighter shade of green. I tried comparing both powders at the same time, and for some reason the latter turns into a dull, muddy green color. Which looked very unappealing! 

Anyway, TLDR; Little Retail PH matcha disappointed me. Super food grocer matcha is heaven! ",1,1751373672.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

1lp0lth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1lp0lth/my_husband_wants_to_combine_everything/,My husband wants to combine everything financially. I want some independence. What works in your marriage?,"My husband (40M - ASD) and I (36F - ADHD) are trying to align on how to manage our money as a married couple and we‚Äôre hitting a wall. First marriage for both of us - USA

He wants to merge everything:
	‚Ä¢	One joint checking
	‚Ä¢	One joint savings
	‚Ä¢	All income and expenses combined, no personal accounts

I‚Äôm more in favor of a hybrid model:
	‚Ä¢	One joint checking for bills and household expenses
	‚Ä¢	One joint savings for shared goals
	‚Ä¢	Separate personal accounts for our individual spending/savings (with predetermined amounts based on an agreed upon budget) 

‚Äî- this set up works well for me since it‚Äôs all split at the time of getting paid.  

We both agree we want to save for big things, especially a house, but here‚Äôs where it gets tricky:
Whenever we talk about contributing more to savings or working toward a financial goal, he‚Äôll bring up how he has things he needs to pay for and ‚Äúwon‚Äôt have much money left.‚Äù 

It leaves me feeling like I‚Äôm the only one expected to make sacrifices for our goals, even though we‚Äôre supposed to be working toward them together.

I make about $40K more per year (gross), and I‚Äôve always been the one to handle the financial planning/bill pay. He pays for all his pre-marital debt, internet bill, some groceries and renters/car insurance and now the car note we bought last month after only having one car for a few years. 

I am fine paying the majority of the bills and saving/not spending so we can buy a house together, but I also don‚Äôt want him to scrutinize every purchase I make (which he swears he won‚Äôt, but I feel like he does this a lot already without access to my accounts). I do NOT want to go ‚Äútit for tat‚Äù through our whole marriage, but he also doesn‚Äôt recognize or acknowledge that I‚Äôve been paying the majority of the bills for the majority of our relationship, so for him to question my spending always feels weird to me. It also might be that we‚Äôre both adults who have been set in our ways. 

I also am attempting to build a business, so I have expenses for that I pay for, and I have a son from a previous relationship who I pay for. 

He‚Äôs very generous to everyone (pays for dinner out, etc) and wants us to share everything, but I prefer to have structure, clarity, and a little autonomy‚Ä¶like not having to justify a $15 Marshall‚Äôs run or a coffee out.


We‚Äôre not fighting, yet. But I can feel tension building because we don‚Äôt have a system that feels fair to both of us.

So I‚Äôm asking: What actually works in your marriage when it comes to money?


Especially if:
	‚Ä¢	You earn different amounts
	‚Ä¢	One of you is the ‚Äúplanner‚Äù and the other is more easygoing or can only think about current needs
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre trying to balance shared goals with personal spending needs

Do you do proportional contributions? Full sharing with ‚Äúfun money‚Äù? Any creative setups that helped you avoid resentment?

I‚Äôd love to hear real experiences. Thanks in advance!

I met my goal to get from Level 2 to 3 in one month! Yes, I have a lot of free time.¬† I find that about 3 hours a day is comfortable for me so hoping to reach level 4 by the end of August¬† I tend to watch an hour in the morning with my coffee (when the cats wake me up to be fed absurdly early), an hour mid-day (preferably outside the house), and an hour in the evening.¬† I also put on podcasts while walking, doing chores, and driving. In general, feeling really good about my progress and where I am on the roadmap.

DS - I have been watching almost every video (sorted by easy) as well as various series that I find interesting.¬† I still technically have 150 hours of beginner videos unwatched with premium so I just started some of the easier (by current difficulty rating) intermediate series.¬† I am enjoying Shel‚Äôs Untold Stories and Geoguessr Around the World.¬†¬†

Podcasts - I‚Äôve been listening to Cu√©ntame and Chill Spanish since around 40-50 hours.¬† Started a bit of Espanol Al Vuelo around 90 hours.

Reading - I know this isn‚Äôt recommended yet but I want to start reading so I am.¬† I got Muerte en Buenos Aires (A1) on Hoopla for free through my public library.¬† It‚Äôs easy and¬† giving me great vocabulary since I love true crime podcasts and shows and hope to listen to them in Spanish later in the journey.

Watching outside of DS - I watched the first 4 episodes of Extra (extr@) and enjoyed it but felt that I wasn‚Äôt comprehending quite enough just yet.¬† I‚Äôll come back to it after getting some more hours in.¬† I watched dubbed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer‚Äôs Stone over a few nights.¬† I enjoyed it and had pretty decent comprehension since I know the movie so well but only counted half the time.

¬†Things that I am thrilled to have learned/read here in this subreddit:

* Sorting by easy: I would have given up in the beginning if I would have tried starting with some of the harder beginner episodes.¬†¬†
* Dreaming Spanish Insights extension: I had to have my teen help me get it installed (if that is even the correct terminology) but I love that I can see the rating in the series view.¬† I randomly started an Intermediate series before getting it and was really disheartened.¬† Then I realized the first video was a 75 and I‚Äôve only been comfortable through about 40.¬† This allowed me to find series around 50 and am much more optimistic that I can start adding some Intermediate series while also finishing up some of my favorite beginner series.
* Updates:¬† I love hearing about each person‚Äôs unique journey!¬† The recommendations and things that worked/didn‚Äôt work are so helpful.¬† I love that people are so willing to provide encouragement and helpful suggestions when people are struggling.
* [Langpractice.com](http://langpractice.com/) for number practice:¬† I feel like an idiot every time I hear a number.¬† My recall on numbers even between 1-10 isn‚Äôt great.¬† I need to throw some time into improving this because I‚Äôve noticed that I was heavily reliant on seeing the numbers in SB and Beginner videos and intermediate videos that I have watched definitely highlight this weakness I have.¬†¬†¬†
* Dreaming Spanish app:¬† I was able to easily download tons of videos to watch during flights when I had no WiFi.¬† It didn‚Äôt count my time on the flight correctly but I just added it manually.¬† To be fair, it was the middle of the night and crossing time zones so maybe that caused an issue?¬† It allowed me to get the input so that was the important thing to me.¬† I prefer using my laptop and regular website, when possible.¬† Easier on my eyes and haven‚Äôt had any tracking issues.

My plan now is to continue getting input, borrowing motivation from y‚Äôall when I need it, and hopefully having a new update at the end of August! ",4,1751373462.0,dreamingspanish,4,1.0,False
1lp0jqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1lp0jqp/am_i_ordering_wrong_at_food_chainsrestaurants/,Am I ordering wrong at food chains/restaurants?,"I want to learn how to order food. Places like restaurants, coffee shops, and bakeries.

I think my wording is clear but I feel like I am not being heard. 

For reference I do try to be nice and polite. I say some variation of ‚Äúhello, could I please get X and Y‚Äù 

I also make sure to reply if they ask how I‚Äôm doing and ask back as well. Make sure to give a smile and also sound friendly. 

Here are a few incidents I‚Äôve experienced: 

I wanted to order a blueberry muffin. They were stacked on top of each other. It was labeled ‚Äúblueberry muffins‚Äù. I asked if I could get a blueberry muffin and the lady told me they were sold out. 

Pointed at the display and asked her if the muffins in the display aren‚Äôt blueberry. She didn‚Äôt look at the display. Only at me and repeated they were sold out. Strange but I left the bakery. 

Same thing happened to me at another bakery. Asked if I could please get a croissant. Was told they didn‚Äôt have any. It was behind a counter and various croissants were displayed and lined up. 

Other people in front of me ordered but I couldn‚Äôt? They were labelled as well and I am pretty sure I know what a croissant looks like. 

Another time I went to a coffee chain. They a
have slushie coffee. It‚Äôs been on the menu for a long time. It‚Äôs my go to order. 

But half the time I get told they don‚Äôt sell that or it‚Äôs not on the menu. I have also pointed at the menu and asked for it and they tell me it‚Äôs not on the menu or they so not sell it. 

I have ordered it before so maybe the machine gets broken at times? One time I went with a friend. Tried to order but no avail. I told my friend they didn‚Äôt have it and my friend tried to order and they got it. Which again, strange. 

This happens often when I go to restaurants. The waiter comes and takes people order and goes down the table of people. I frequently get skipped and the waiter asks for the person next to me what their order is. 

My friends have had to stop the waiter because they got everyone else‚Äôs order but mine. My friends have also volunteered to order for me since this has been a reoccurring issue. Which is very kind of them and I have taken them up on the offer once in a while.  

Also when we go out to eat, I often don‚Äôt receive my food, the last one to receive it when everyone else is ready to pay, or I am given the wrong thing.

It has never happened to any of my friends when we eat out. I understand that workers are people and make mistakes but it has never happened to my friends. Sometimes I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm being singled out. It‚Äôs a bit frustrating.

I have also gone out of my way to order appetizers since those come out first and things that are easier to make on the menu just so that I can eat at the same time as everyone. It does work to an extent but it still happens

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I am maybe the problem if this keeps happening to me. 

I have tried looking back at multiple variations of these situations I have been in but I don‚Äôt think I have done anything wrong? Would like some insight from another perspective

I try to be polite when I order food. I say please and thank you. Make sure to smile. If they ask how I am, I always reply and ask back. Make small talk if they initiate it.

Chapter 8: Weekend at Legacy's 



Keith remained inside his car where he was, thinking about giving Laura a call to try and speak to her. Knowing that he hadn't spoken to his fiancee for the last few days. Once Keith finally decided to step out of his car, he went on a walk to find a payphone he could use. Shortly upon spotting a payphone nearby, he walked across the street towards it. He picked up the handset, inserting a dime into the coin slot as he dials up Laura's number, hoping that she'll pick up and answer him at any moment. 



In the meantime, Laura was at her apartment somewhere around downtown. Lying on the couch in the living room, she casually read through her favorite romance novel as part of her pastimes. A picture frame showing both Laura and Keith looking lovingly at each other was also seen sitting on a tall corner cabinet shelf, a small reminder of their love amidst the clutter. Precisely as she was about to turn to the next page of her book, the telephone over the side table near the couch began to ring, forcing her to put her book aside. As Laura got up, she reached in to grab the receiver of the phone. She proceeded to answer the call. 



""Hello, who am I speaking to?"" 



""Laura? Hey, it's me, Keith!"" He responded. 



""Oh, Keith! Where have you been? It's been awhile.. I was just thinking about you."" Laura continued shortly after drinking a glass of lemonade, ""We haven't spoken to each other for like a few days.""



""I know.. I'm doing alright if you're wondering,"" Keith said. ""I just called to check on you since we haven't talk that much or seen each other."" He chuckled then asked, ""What about you, Laura? Are you feeling good?"" 



Laura replied with a smile, ""I'm currently in the great mood today, Keith! Thanks for asking."" She added and asked, ""By the way, I'm heading to The Oasis Nightclub tonight, wanna come along?""



Keith responded to her happily, ""Oh, REALLY?! That sounds wonderful, Laura! I hear that's a fun place to hang out. I'm definitely gonna be there for you."" 



Laura giggled as she rubs her hair with her hand, ""Come pick me up at my place by 7pm,"" She continued in a flirty tone, ""Don't keep this lovely vixen waiting.."" 



""Oh, don't you worry, babe. I promised that I'll be there in no time."" 



""Anyways, I gotta go now. Stay safe out there, Keith! Sending you my best kisses."" 



Keith chuckled, ""See you later, Laura."" 



Shortly after hanging up the phone, Keith jumped back and forth in excitement on the pavement. Throughout his whole life, Keith has never visited a nightclub before. However, with Laura, having to had given him a chance to is what made him consider visiting one for the first time, so that he could finally get to spend some quality time with his fiancee again. 



Meanwhile, Trace and Flora were both busy cleaning around the apartment. While Flora thoroughly cleans the living room using a vacuum cleaner, Trace was at the kitchen taking out the trash once he has everything sorted out. Upon walking into the living room, Trace stopped by for a little bit. He then called up to Flora to remind her. 



""I'll be right outside to take out the trash.""



""Okay."" Flora responded. She looked at him with a cute smile on her face. ""Care to give my favorite human a kiss on his cheek for sec?"" 



Trace nodded. ""Uh, sure, I guess.."" 



Flora approached closer towards him. She leaned in and kissed Trace on his cheek, then winked at him as she pulled out. Trace smiled and looked at her for a moment before leaving through the front door as he headed downstairs to the garage. 



Keith was now making his way back to his car. Looking across the street where he parked his car, he stopped and noticed a blue-haired human walking out of the garage holding a garbage bag. He stared momentarily and, to his surprise, he immediately recognized that it was Trace. Once Trace had taken out the trash into the plastic bin, he turned to look in the direction where Keith stood still. Trace looked confused at one moment but eventually recognized him thanks to his military combat field uniform jacket. 



""Keith..? Hey - I wasn't expecting I'd see you again!"" 



Keith waved his hand upon Trace and called back. ""Oh, Trace..! I-I  never thought we'd come across to see each other...""



Keith looked both ways as he walked across the street closer towards Trace. He stood close to him with both of his hands in his pocket. 



Trace asked, ""Say, how are you holding up ever since we last saw each other on the day of the robbery?"" 



Keith replied, ""I'm doing fine.. What about you and that keidran tiger girl?"" 



""You mean Flora? Oh, she and I are quite doing well. You know, living the usual normal life for the last few days.""



""That's good to hear,"" Keith said. ""By the way, I still owe you for saving my life back there.."" He recalled. 



""Hey - don't worry about it, Keith, It was my pleasure."" Trace smiled upon him. ""Anyways, what brings you out here?"" 



 ""Well.. I was driving some a couple of newcomers who were just moving in. Their car had broken down in front of my house, so I gave them a lift and soon dropped them here."" 



""I'm pleased to hear it from you."" Trace then added, ""Oh, hey - would you care if you'd like to stop by at my apartment for a little while?""



""That's pretty nice at all, Trace, but I have other things in mind that I must take care of."" Keith responded negatively. 



""Okay,"" Trace said. ""Have a great day, Keith! Feel free to drop by anytime you like.""



Once Keith had got into his car, he pulled out his key and inserted it into the ignition. However, after multiple attempts, his car was unable to start as it only makes a clicking noise, which made Keith to feel deeply frustrated upon. 



""You have got to be fucking kidding.."" Keith said, muttering in frustration as he slammed his hands over the steering wheel. 



Upon pulling the hood release lever, Keith stepped out and stood in front of his car. He raised the hood all the way up, figuring out what's causing the problem below the engine bay. It didn't take long for him to figure out the problem and speculated that it was an aging battery.  



Trace walked closer to him and asked in concern, ""Hey, Keith? You alright? What seems to be the problem here?"" 



Keith sighed and said flatly, ""Well.. I guess I'm gonna have to stop by at your place for a while."" 



""Here, I'll lead you right in."" 



Trace went ahead to lead the way, which Keith proceeded to follow after him up to his apartment. While Flora was busy dusting off one of the curtains in the living room, she quickly turned around once as she heard the front door opened up. She stood still and watched as Trace and Keith walked in. 



""Flora, this is Keith,"" Trace said introducing him, ""He'll be happy to join us today for a while."" 



""KEITH?!!!,"" Flora shouted in excitement. She felt an extreme level of happiness upon seeing him. ""I'm so happy to see my favorite basitin again! It has been like ages since that day when we first met.""



Keith looked at Flora and gave her a small nervous smile, waving his hand upon her. ""Yeah, I-I know.. It was Trace's idea to invite me here."" 



""Make yourself comfortable at home, Keith."" Trace added, ""So, would you like a cup of coffee and some toast?"" 



Keith answered, ""Sure.. I haven't eaten anything yet this morning. Other than that, I had a single can of pepsi earlier.""



Keith walked across the living room and into the kitchen to grab a seat. He sat down at the dining table, staring at the clear and sunny sky across the window with his usual blank expression on his face. Trace on the other hand, went to focus on preparing a cup of coffee and a toast as well. After a short while, he walked over to Keith at the dining table and took a seat as he sat near beside him.



""Here you go, Keith,"" Trace said, gently placing down a cup of coffee on the table, alongside a burnt-out toast. ""Sorry that I had burnt the toast a little, but that's okay, it's not a big deal.""



""Gee, thanks for making me breakfast, Trace."" Keith responded with a gratitude. He took a sip of his coffee first before proceeding to take a bite of his toast.



They were later joined by Flora as soon as she was done tidying up the living room. She walked up to them and sat down at the opposite side of the dining table facing directly in front of Trace. 



Looking at Keith with a smile across her face, she went to ask him nicely, ""So, Keith? How have you been lately?""



""Eh, not much.. but I'm doing fine,"" Keith responded at her. He looked at Trace and said, ""I must say, Trace, this is a nice cozy place you got.""



""Oh, thanks,"" Trace replied. ""Flora and I have been living here together ever since we knew each other."" 



""Wow... that's quite charming to hear."" Keith added once he took another sip of his coffee, ""You know.. ever since when I met you two on the day of the robbery, I've been thinking about reuniting with the two of you someday... and yet here we are."" 



Flora smiled and said cheerfully, ""Awww, I'm glad you shared that with us, Keith."" She added, ""You and Trace, and that wolf girl were so fearless."" 



""Oh - you mean that wolf Natani?"" Trace raised his eyebrows. 



Keith said as he recalled, ""I gotta say.. that wolf chick sure went full psycho when I saw her running fearlessly towards that guy then finishing him off with a drop kick to the face shortly after."" 



""I'd love to see her again, Trace! Do you think we'll ever get to meet her again?"" Flora looked and asked him. 



""I don't know, Flora.. She seems like a complete stranger to us and I've doubt we'll be able to reunite with her anytime soon."" Trace replied.



""Aww... I'm kinda hoping that we'll ever see her again.."" 



 Trace turned to face Keith and asked him, ""By the way, if I remember correctly, you did mentioned to us that you served in the Gulf War, right?""



""Yeah,"" Keith answered. ""I enlisted and served as a marine when the war began.."" He added, ""I was once a crew gunner of an M1 Abrams tank during operation desert storm.""



""Would you like to tell us about your experience, Keith? What was it like from your perspective?"" Flora asked him curiously. 



Keith sighed then took a long pause for a brief moment. There was silence around them for a little bit until Keith finally spoke out. 



""Well.. Based from my experience, I'll describe it like this,"" He took his coffee and continued shortly. ""By the time I've been deployed, I spent couple of months in a base in Saudi Arabia. It's an entirely different world. Everything seems to be calm and boring at first... Then the following months came in and that's where the real battle begun.. We went to Kuwait, fought several Iraqi forces who had taken over the entire city, and wiped them out completely.."" 



Keith paused for a bit as he looked down at the table. A moment of silence was filled around them. 



""I wasn't thinking about the person I'm shooting at may had a family. I wasn't thinking about whether that I was dying or not, to me it was just to shoot back and hold out for as long as I could.""



""Whoa.. I'm glad you were able to make it out safe, Keith,"" Trace said, smiling at him. ""Thank you for your service and sacrifices, my basitin friend. I can totally understand that you really had a rough time serving there."" 



""I know,"" Keith replied flatly.



Flora smiled at him cutely, ""Awww..! I appreciate your courage and dedication, Keith."" She added and asked, ""I'm sorry to bring this up but I've heard news about this Gulf War Syndrome thing that has been affecting combat veterans recently... Have you happen to experience any of it lately?"" 



""The Gulf War Syndrome..? That's a good question, Flora,"" Keith responded. He answered shortly after he finished eating his toast, ""So far, I haven't experienced none of it luckily. It's basically due to the fact that basitins are known to be more immune to the side effects, but humans and keidrans on the other hand? Well, they aren't unfortunately..""



Flora replied, ""Oh.. Okay then?""



Keith proceeded to take another sip of his coffee. There was silence surrounding among them, with the birds peacefully chirping outside and the clock over at the kitchen wall continuously ticking each second. Shortly after Keith was done, he gently placed the coffee mug aside next to the empty plate where his toast once sat on. 



""Anyways, It was nice to hang out with you guys. You're both wonderful, but I must get going right now if you'd excuse me,"" Keith said as he stood up from his chair. 



Trace stood up and reminded him, ""Keith - wait a sec. Have you forgot that your were having car troubles earlier, right?"" 



""Crap.. I kinda forgot about that,"" Keith replied. ""Mind if you guys could give me a jumpstart?"" 



Flora said happily, ""Sure thing, Keith! Anything for my favorite basitin!"" 



The three of them began heading out to the front door, leading them downstairs to the garage area. 



""I'll go get a pair of jumper cables! Just give me one moment.""



While Keith and Flora head to their cars, Trace scrambled to try to find his jumper cables, which are inside a toolbox located in the cargo space of his Subaru Wagon. Reaching onto his keys from his pocket, he unlocks and opens the rear tailgate, lifting it upwards with his hands. Shortly upon grabbing the toolbox that contains the jumper cables, Trace closes the tailgate door shut. With the toolbox in his hands, he headed over to Flora, who had already positioned her VW Cabriolet near to Keith's Oldsmobile. Both cars had their hoods opened up as well. 



Trace instructed Flora, ""Now, make sure that your engine is not up and running. Don't try to start the ignition until I say so."" 



""Gotcha, Trace."" Flora nodded. 



Walking up in front of Flora's car, where he stood by, Trace grabbed his pair of jumper cables from the tool box and then hooked them onto the battery. Keith stood still and watched from the driver-side fender of his car as Trace also went over to attach one positive clamp to the terminal of the dead battery. He then also attaches the negative clamp onto a bare piece of metal section of the inner fender along the side of the hood as well. 



""Alright, guys.. Everything should be working properly as intended,"" Trace said. He turned to Flora and gives her a thumbs up signal, ""Okay, Flora, go ahead and try starting it up!"" 



Upon turning on the ignition, Flora let her car idle for atleast a couple of minutes. After that, Keith went back into his car then puts the key into the ignition, hoping for the best that it would start up any time soon. As Keith turned the ignition on, his car was soon able to start up successfully with a single click. 



""Oh thank God, finally.."" 



A cheerful grin spread across Keith's face followed shortly with a chuckle. He rolled down the driver-side window as he called upon Trace and Flora. 



""Hey - I gotta say.. thanks a bunch for your help, guys!"" 



Trace responded back, ""No worries, Keith! We're just glad to help.""



Trace went to remove the jumper cables carefully in reverse order. Upon putting them back into the toolbox, he walked up to the driver-side window of Keith's car. Flora also followed him from behind. She stood beside Trace then held him firmly in her arms, rubbing her cheek along his neck. 



""You know, Keith.. me and Trace would often enjoy helping each other."" Flora said, showing off a small smile on her face. 



""I see.."" Keith replied. He added, ""By the way, I'm heading out with my fiancee to a nightclub called The Oasis tonight. Do you guys wanna come over as well?""



""A nightclub?!"" Intrigued, Flora looked at Trace, showing her cute eyes. She asked him, ""Can we go see Keith at the nightclub, Trace? Pretty please..?"" 



Trace responded, ""Eh.. Sure! I guess..?"" 



""YIPPEE!!!"" Flora shouted eagerly. 



""Oh-! I almost forgot."" Keith added, ""If you'd like to drop by for a visit, I live down at 462 Pinewood Drive In Echo Park. Feel free to see me anytime.""



""Okay, Keith! See ya around and take care, buddy!"" Trace genuinely smiled. He then waved his hand at him. 



Flora winked and added, ""Catch ya later, big ears!"" 



Keith waved back at them shortly before shifting it into gear. Both Trace and Flora stood still holding each other. They watched as Keith took a U-turn then soon drove off from the street. ",4,1751373395.0,Twokinds,3,1.0,False

Just don't want to miss out on any ""must-do"" spots! Thanks for your help!

My prompt: Can you give me the best driving route for a trip from Seattle to Mt. Rainier National Park by private vehicle to give us the most scenic drives and vantage points for stopping? We do not want to do extensive hiking but small walks/hikes are okay. We also need a place to stop to eat lunch in the park. We will be leaving Seattle at 7:30 AM and need to return by 7 PM.

1lp0ds1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1lp0ds1/epic_private_vip_tour_report/,Epic Private VIP tour report,"Disclaimer: sharing this not as an intent to justify the price or to brag, but so others can make well-informed decisions about how to visit the park. Obviously Universal has raised their private tour prices considerably to the point where they‚Äôre in line with Disney prices, so take that info consideration. 

We visited the park with a group of 6 on Sunday, 6/29 with a private tour booking.  

Arrival was handled well, better than the tours at the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù parks. We parked at the Valet and followed the signs, and there was a separate security gate with a check in and all the guides waiting for groups were already ready and waiting (despite being about 15 minutes early). Our guide David was great throughout and we jumped right in and got an early start. 

Private tours at 8 hours, including a 1-hour lunch break. Depending on the guide, and your preference, the guide may eat lunch with you (ours did) but regardless the lunch break is part of the 8 hours. I understand this is considerably longer than the current shared VIP tours at the park, and it feel more than adequate to cover Epic. Private Epic tours only cover Epic, no park hopping, in contrast to the legacy park tours which hop freely between both. 

We opted for some quick breakfast. All VIP breakfasts are at Oak and Star which have a small breakfast menu (maybe just for the tours?). Big breakfast sandwiches, too big honestly, which were OK. Coffee and other beverages. The cost of breakfast is included (except alcohol) and the time spent is part of the tour time. 

During breakfast we discussed park strategy and had the game plan of hitting all the rain-dependent rides as early as possible as the forecast was rain at 2pm (typical FL summer). We started with Donkey Kong as it was open early (it‚Äôs still pre general open, around 9:45). As tours do, we went through the exit and were on board within 5 minutes, and re-rode once. Highly rated by the group. 

Worth calling out one difference from shared tours we‚Äôve done in the past: for private tours there‚Äôs no restrictions on re-rides.  The last time we did a shared tour at ‚Äúold‚Äù parks there were often limited, like once on Hagrids. Even Disney limits re-rides on popular stuff like Guardians, so this was a nice surprise. 

All the VIP guides use their phone for apps and chat channels that let them know what‚Äôs up and what‚Äôs down. This is a great benefit because most of the time, they‚Äôre able to guide the group around problem spots without you even being aware of them, like magic. This means you can just enjoy the park and have fun and not be on your phone constantly. 

After DK we rode Stardust (yellow) once, and then did Battle at the Ministry twice, each time taking an exit path route so boarding in around 4-5 minutes. When entering Ministry we saw the posted waiting time was around 150 so clearly saving loads of time here. Guides often share a little backstory about the ride while entering (pausing in a cool or quiet spot) so you can have a sort of ‚Äúcliffs notes‚Äù version of the queue story. I‚Äôm guessing you could ask them for some way to go through the queue to see the beats as well but we generally didn‚Äôt do that.  

Guides will usually not ride with the party unless it‚Äôs not super busy and the headcount makes sense. So often the guides are holding or watching bags, avoiding the need for the locker process at each ride. Which again makes things go smoothly. 

I don‚Äôt recall the exact order we hit other rides, but we set our plans for a 2pm lunch (based on rain forecast) and had hit all the major rides by that time. Monsters was a big hit, as well as the Werewolf coaster. The surprise sleeper hit was the Firefighter Boats in Berk which the kids loved once it became apparent you can fire at other boats as well as targets. But we also discovered after re-riding that not all boats have equal range!

We loved all the rides, honestly and avoided all downtimes and stoppages. Never waited more than 5 minutes at a ride. At 2pm we had lunch at Stakehouse. Lunch is included at any Epic restaurant. Lunch and dinner are covered at 1 entree, 1 desert, 1 non-alcoholic beverage per person, and 1/2 appetizer (rounded up). That‚Äôs honestly a lot of food and generally too much for us. When the guide eats, that can add to the appetizer count (7 of us = 4 apps). Waiting a long time for our food but we weren‚Äôt in a rush, and the food quality was better than expected. 

We stopped a few times for snacks as well, not included, so just used normal mobile app and paid.  Rain started just as we entered for lunch, so timing was perfect. Guides have good weather apps I guess. 

After lunch we re-rode some favorites (Monsters, Werewolf, DK). By 4:15 we felt we had really accomplished all we wanted ride-wise so we ended early with the guide, tipped, and then went and enjoyed some adult beverages and entertainment at the Plastered Owl which was a fun way to wind down during the light rain. 

After the tour, the VIP pass acts as an unlimited express pass for all rides that take Express at Epic. I noticed Stardust was running despite light rain, so went back and rode green, was a walk on at that time (with or without express). 

Before parting, we asked the guide to make dinner reservations at the Blue Dragon at 7. At parting they had you a voucher (dinner is also included in tour price) which had the same limits as lunch (1+1+1+one half). This again was a LOT of food here, and the food was also better than expected for inside a theme park. Dishes here had real flavor and quality. 

So TLDR on the private tour experience:
+ runs very smoothly, guides can hide all the rough edges of park operations issues and weather (to a degree)
+ Universal VIP beats Disney in terms of direct access to rides and no (known) limits on re-rides
+ food coverage was 100% for our day minus snacks and alcohol. 
- 8 hours at Epic is probably more time than you‚Äôll need with VIP given the ride count
+ unlimited express after is nice (I‚Äôve read that shared VIP gets a different express pass level after tour?)
- cost, obviously 

Epic totally lived up to the hype for us given this access. ",2,1751372955.0,UniversalOrlando,3,0.75,False
1lp0cbe,https://i.redd.it/1wj1ansma9af1.jpeg,"$ATYR ‚Äì HC Wainwright Reaffirms Buy at $35 (June 30, 2025): Dissecting Analyst Motives Ahead of Readout","Hi folks,

Before diving into this one, I want to flag something quickly. Yesterday a community member reached out to me with some feedback on my writing style. They shared that while they find much value in my deep dives and updates and appreciate the clarity, they sometimes find the density a bit overwhelming ‚Äî especially as someone still learning the ropes on biotech and investing. They said they‚Äôre often trying to summarise mentally on the fly, and while they don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúdumbed down‚Äù version, they‚Äôd love to see a version that‚Äôs just a bit more digestible. Succinct, but still sharp.

That stuck with me ‚Äî not as a criticism, but as a genuine prompt to keep improving the offering for this community.

So while this is a shorter post anyway, I‚Äôm making a more conscious effort to layer the structure more clearly and explain where needed. So I‚Äôll do my usual analysis ‚Äî but better signposted, better paced, and more intentional about how I introduce and unpack each idea. Let me know how I go.

Ok, let‚Äôs jump in.

---

### What happened?

On Monday, June 30, 2025, HC Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis reaffirmed his **Buy rating** and **$35 price target** on aTyr Pharma ($ATYR). That‚Äôs notable because it follows a similar reaffirmation just a few weeks earlier on June 4.

No new note or thesis change appears to have been published. Instead, this was likely a **flash reaffirmation** ‚Äî logged in systems like Bloomberg or FactSet, and distributed quietly to clients through sales desks or internal alerts. I happened to be notified through an alert on from TipRanks.

To the outside world, this kind of reaffirmation might look minor. But in biotech ‚Äî especially small-cap biotech ‚Äî even these ‚Äúquiet‚Äù moves are worth reading into.

---

### So what? Why reaffirm now?

This is where we move from observation to interpretation. Here are a few plausible reads, broken down clearly.

---

### 1. It‚Äôs about keeping clients warm ahead of a major binary event

At a basic level, this may be Pantginis just ensuring that his house view remains current and visible in the lead-up to a high-stakes Phase 3 readout.

This kind of reaffirmation can:
- Help re-anchor institutional sentiment
- Signal conviction without requiring a full note
- Re-engage clients who may be tracking the stock passively

Especially when the price target is already **well above** market price, a reaffirmation close to a known catalyst acts as a quiet ‚Äúwe‚Äôre still in‚Äù message.

In my view, that‚Äôs the base case here ‚Äî the reaffirmation ensures ATYR stays top-of-mind ahead of what could be a defining moment for the stock.

---

### 2. It‚Äôs timing with the July 30‚Äì31 Cantor NDR

Here‚Äôs where it gets more interesting.

As we‚Äôve discussed in other threads, the upcoming **Cantor-hosted Non-Deal Roadshow (NDR)** ‚Äî in-person meetings in Denver, followed by a second virtual day ‚Äî looks, to me at least, like a classic post-data investor outreach move. I‚Äôve laid out in prior posts why I think aTyr likely already has top-line Phase 3 results in hand (or nearly in hand) and why the structure of the NDR supports that theory.

If that‚Äôs the case, then Pantginis‚Äô reaffirmation on **June 30**, exactly one month prior to the NDR, could be read as a **preemptive flag plant**.

That is:
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre reaffirming now ‚Äî before the roadshow, before any broader re-rating begins ‚Äî because we want it on record that we‚Äôve been long this name all along.‚Äù

Analyst credibility matters, especially in small-cap biotech. If HCW later moves their target price higher on the back of a clean readout, this June 30 reaffirmation will serve as cover for that upgrade ‚Äî a breadcrumb showing consistency.

---

### 3. It may set the stage for a post-readout refresh

Let‚Äôs consider the broader chessboard here.

If the readout is positive ‚Äî and especially if it delivers clean statistical separation on key endpoints ‚Äî then we can expect analysts to start upgrading models and issuing new price targets. But to do that credibly, especially if you‚Äôre already covering the stock, you don‚Äôt want to appear like you‚Äôve just woken up to the story.

This reaffirmation could be a **positioning move** ‚Äî a way for Pantginis and HCW to:
- Signal coverage continuity
- Avoid looking reactive
- Create a bridge from their current model to whatever assumptions they update post-readout

In other words: if a re-initiation or deep-dive note is coming in August, this is the placeholder.

---

### 4. Is there a whisper of company contact? Maybe. But let‚Äôs be cautious.

To be very clear: we have **no evidence** that this reaffirmation was prompted by a company meeting. But just for completeness ‚Äî analysts do sometimes check in with management ahead of upcoming events to confirm publicly known milestones, logistics, etc. These conversations can be enough to prompt reaffirmations.

If Pantginis or HCW had spoken with management ‚Äî even briefly ‚Äî and confirmed that the NDR was indeed happening, that alone could‚Äôve been a trigger to reaffirm and ensure the stock remains on the radar.

But again, that‚Äôs speculative. I mention it because it‚Äôs part of how coverage dynamics sometimes work in biotech.

---

### How do reaffirmations like this work behind the scenes?

Just to unpack a bit more for those newer to the space ‚Äî a **‚Äúreaffirmation‚Äù** like this doesn‚Äôt usually involve a full updated model or new data analysis. It‚Äôs often a short internal note or system tag that updates the database entries on platforms like Bloomberg, FactSet, or Refinitiv.

Why does this matter?

Because many institutional desks filter stock coverage by:
- Most recent rating
- Time since last contact
- Implied return vs current price

So keeping a rating current ‚Äî even without a new note ‚Äî means a stock like $ATYR keeps showing up on screens and in filters for analysts and PMs scanning for actionable ideas.

That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs happening here. It‚Äôs not just optics. It‚Äôs about staying in view.

---

### The bigger takeaway

Events like this don‚Äôt move the needle in isolation ‚Äî but they‚Äôre part of the picture. They‚Äôre signals.

In my view, this isn‚Äôt about HCW ‚Äúknowing‚Äù something others don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs about staying close to a story they‚Äôre already committed to ‚Äî and about re-anchoring their stance ahead of what may be a pivotal event for aTyr.

I‚Äôve said before: biotech is a game of narrative control and expectation management. Analysts, IR teams, and buy-side desks are all players in that ecosystem. Reaffirmations like this are a subtle, but deliberate, move in that broader choreography.

It doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything about the data. But it *does* tell you how some of the better-connected parts of the market are choosing to show up right now.

So when you see a rating, it always pays to read between the lines because that‚Äôs where the real story might be hiding.

---

### Final thought ‚Äî and thank you again

I‚Äôm still experimenting with how to balance depth and accessibility in these posts. If you‚Äôve been following along ‚Äî or if you‚Äôre just joining ‚Äî I appreciate you. And if you‚Äôre someone who offered feedback on the writing (you know who you are), thank you again for helping shape how I communicate here. I‚Äôm trying to make each post a little better than the last.

1lp0c9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1lp0c9z/new_hererant/,New here/rant,"Hi all, I got my uterus removed at 35 and now 42. About 4 yrs ago I started being in rage, taking it out on my husband, upset when I didn‚Äôt get attention from him and even separated for a while. It was around the time I quit my job as a nurse and became a sahm. Never been a needy person. Always independent. So I didn‚Äôt know why I was so upset. A couple of years ago severe night sweats, ringing in the ears, libido almost disappeared except maybe once or twice a month which I think is when I‚Äôm ovulating. Always smelled pee and my husband thought I was crazy. Making soaps, lotions and our own skincare along with baking bread relieves my anxiety. However, I don‚Äôt know how to just make one thing or two is usually 3-8 back to back until I‚Äôm mentally exhausted. Just a few months ago realized it is perimenopause. I started breaking out about a month ago. I‚Äôve always had oily skin but was taking tretinoin for about two years until I decided to stop it a few months ago and go the more natural route. Also, the migraines are insane. But that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve suffered from for a few years. I usually weight train at the gym with my husband 2 days a wk. Although haven‚Äôt felt like it the past couple of weeks. I am constantly moving at home any ways and running errands. I do t know how to sit down for more than a few mins. How in the world did I gain 8 pounds I. A matter of a month? I cook from scratch. Don‚Äôt really eat much. I have to force myself to eat at times at night to make sure I get enough calories. Mostly is just my coffee and protein. Bread when I bake fresh otherwise do t eat anymore until I bake another batch. Even make our own ice cream. Started consuming Keifer and the l reuteri yogurt as well as raw milk and the cheese and butter I make from it. Started taking black cohosh, red clover, chasteberry along with lemon balm and other calming herbs. I usually make my own tinctures with them. Wild yam is a new one I purchased less than a week ago and made my own capsules as well as lotion with it and the rest of the herbs. Along with supplements like vitamin d, magnesium glycinate, etc. I‚Äôve always suffered with insomnia until stopped taking prescription meds religiously about 8 yrs ago. But the insomnia seemed to come back with a vengeance about 3 months ago. The magnesium doesn‚Äôt work. The blue light glasses either. Had my husband changed the light bulbs to a warm orange hue. Add on top of the fact that for the past 2 wks I am watching my grandkids at night so my daughter can work and that includes a 3 month old that‚Äôs having a hard time adjusting. I have a 7 and 9 yr old myself and I feel bad when I don‚Äôt get up to tend for them. Although, I raised them to be self sufficient and they are more than capable of making their own breakfast or snack without touching the stove. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just overstimulated. My husband tells me to sit and don‚Äôt do anything. To relax. That the house won‚Äôt fall apart if I don‚Äôt clean it or wash the dishes as soon as there is one in the sink. 

Any advice on to what to do or not? I do t want to loose it. I want to function normally at home. Did I mention I also homeschool? TIA",0,1751372836.0,Perimenopause,1,0.5,False

Chapter 2: Homeroom, Homework, and a Dream Catcher Sword

Alice C. Gale had always considered herself a fairly normal girl.

Sure, she was a little late to school sometimes.

Sure, she talked to her alarm clock when no one was around.

And yes, ever since she blasted a dream monster into oblivion last week, the thing had been ticking again and occasionally glowing at random intervals.

But otherwise? Normal.

Totally normal.


---

‚ÄúMiss Gale,‚Äù said Principal Terra Luna, her voice precise as a metronome. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of uniform.‚Äù

Alice blinked, standing just outside the school‚Äôs main doors. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ am?‚Äù

Terra‚Äôs eyes dropped to Alice‚Äôs waist.

There, hanging from her belt like a sidearm, was the brass alarm clock. Its celestial engravings gleamed faintly in the morning light.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre aware that accessories are limited to standard-issue pins and club badges,‚Äù the principal said.

Alice flushed. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI know! But I can‚Äôt leave it at home. It hums if I take it off. I think it hates my closet.‚Äù

Behind them, Sam Noctis nearly dropped his coffee.

He chuckled. ‚ÄúSome clocks are like cats. They get temperamental.‚Äù

Terra gave him a long look. ‚ÄúYou gave her that, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I did,‚Äù Sam muttered.


---

That morning‚Äôs homeroom was‚Ä¶ weird.

Sam wheeled in a large metal cart stacked with strange wooden disks tied with wire and crystal.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve made everyone something special,‚Äù he said with a too-wide smile that made everyone shift nervously. ‚ÄúConsider it a science experiment. Or an art project. Or a lucky charm. Who knows?‚Äù

He passed them out one by one‚Äîwoven dream catchers, each with a different pattern and central gemstone.

‚ÄúThese are prototype dream filters,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll help you sleep better. Keep nightmares away. Unless, of course, your nightmares are about dream catchers. Then I‚Äôve made it worse. Sorry about that.‚Äù

Alice took hers last.

It was different.

Hers shimmered faintly. The wires were etched with the same symbols as her alarm clock. Instead of a gem in the center, there was a shard of cracked mirror.

‚ÄúWhere did this come from?‚Äù she asked.

Sam blinked, lips tightening.

‚ÄúIt was... left behind.‚Äù


---

Lunch break brought a rare sunny day in Twilight‚Äôs Ember. Alice sat on the hill behind the school with her best friend, Juno, who was trying to stack grapes into a leaning tower of snack.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù Juno said between bites. ‚ÄúFirst the weird dream fog last week, and now every teacher‚Äôs acting like the town's going through a magical flu season.‚Äù

Alice glanced at her clock. It pulsed once, like it agreed.

‚ÄúYou ever feel like‚Ä¶ things are happening behind the scenes?‚Äù Alice asked.

Juno popped a grape into her mouth. ‚ÄúAlways. But in this town? It‚Äôs more like they‚Äôre happening just barely off-screen. You blink and poof‚Äîanother student has sleep paralysis and five teachers go on ‚Äòvacation.‚Äô‚Äù

Alice laughed.

Then paused.

Because the dream catcher on her lap shimmered‚Äîonce.

And transformed.

It unraveled in a blur of ribbons and light, reshaping into a blade. Not metal, but crystal and gear. A sword made of memory and ticking sound.

Alice stared.

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù Juno said, eyes wide. ‚ÄúDid you just... pull a sword out of your dream catcher?‚Äù

Alice tried to answer.

The sword shattered.

Fragments dissolved into stardust.

Juno blinked. ‚ÄúOkay. Cool. Totally not alarming.‚Äù

Alice looked at the broken dream catcher on her lap‚Äînow just a circle of twine and thread again. She could still hear the echo of the sword‚Äôs chime.

> Once, before breaking.




---

That evening, after most students had gone home, Alice wandered into the science room.

Sam Noctis was still there, adjusting knobs on a device that looked like a birdcage mated with a satellite dish.

‚ÄúI broke it,‚Äù Alice said, placing the remains of her dream catcher on his desk.

Sam didn‚Äôt look up.

‚ÄúYou were only meant to use it in the dream world.‚Äù

Alice flinched. ‚ÄúIt changed before I could stop it.‚Äù

Now Sam looked up.

He studied her face for a moment, then exhaled. ‚ÄúSometimes, items adapt. Especially when they resonate. Yours‚Ä¶ is unique. It was part of a set. Lost, mostly.‚Äù

Alice touched the metal ring gently. ‚ÄúIt turned into a sword. It felt‚Ä¶ right. Like I was supposed to have it.‚Äù

Sam hesitated.

‚ÄúYou probably were.‚Äù


---

Meanwhile, in the depths of sleep...

Night Terror stood before the crack in the veil, her wings folded tight, her gaze narrowed.

‚ÄúShe carries the Clock and now the Mirror. The past crawls back.‚Äù

A Fright knelt beside her. ‚ÄúShall we remove the girl?‚Äù

Night Terror smiled softly.

‚ÄúNo. Not yet. A hero delays... but they also gather. And when they gather, they create tragedy. Let her think she is winning. Let her dream of victory.‚Äù

She placed one hand on the veil.

It pulsed once‚Äîthen cracked a little deeper.

# Weather & Weekday Rundown: 

We‚Äôre kicking off the first day of July with some passing rain showers, but they aren't here to stay. Expect things to dry out within a few hours, giving way to sunshine early this afternoon. We‚Äôre not entirely in the clear, however, as some pop-up showers and thunderstorms are possible through the afternoon and early evening. Highs today will reach the upper 80s, and the humidity will certainly make it feel warmer. Wednesday looks to be bright and sunny with highs again in the mid to upper 80s. The best news comes for Thursday, as it now looks like the forecast is clearing up, with storms expected to pass through before evening, giving a green light for the fireworks display.

If you‚Äôre looking to work off some weekend indulgence, tonight‚Äôs the night (note: newsletter posted on Mondays).¬†Skirack¬†is hosting its weekly group run at 6 p.m., a casual three to five mile jaunt starting from their Run Center; this will be weekly Monday event! On Tuesday, you‚Äôve got options. For those feeling the rhythm,¬†Switchback Brewing¬†is holding its monthly Latin Dance Night, with a beginner bachata class at 6 p.m. followed by a social dance. Or, if you‚Äôre looking to relive some glory days,¬†Einstein‚Äôs Taphouse¬†is launching a new weekly Grateful Dead residency, ‚ÄòDead is Alive,‚Äô on the old Club Toast stage, bringing a cherished Burlington tradition back to life. Doors are at 7 p.m.

The rest of the week is just as packed. Wednesday offers a chance for some slightly nerdy fun with a¬†Lord of the Rings trivia night¬†at the Venetian Soda Lounge from 7 to 9 p.m., complete with themed cocktails and a costume contest. Earlier that day, the summer concert series continues at City Hall Park with the¬†Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic¬†playing from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. But the big show, of course, is Thursday‚Äôs¬†July 3rd Independence Day Celebration¬†at Waterfront Park. Kicking off at 5 p.m., the evening features food vendors, live music from Jesse Ray Smith, and Vermont‚Äôs largest fireworks display over the lake at 9:30 p.m. Organizers are strongly recommending the GMT shuttle from UVM or biking in (hello, free bike valet) to avoid the inevitable traffic jam. It‚Äôs the can‚Äôt miss event of the week, so plan accordingly.

Reminder about Wednesdays: We noticed that Church St businesses teamed up with the Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata! Be sure to check out the huge list of deals they came up with for every Wednesday. 20% off Vermont Pub and Brew? Sheesh! Also, reminder about July 10th for our second-ever Friends mixer at the Pinery. First one was an awesome time, I can‚Äôt wait to see those again, and hopefully new faces too!

Today‚Äôs high of 88‚ÄØ¬∞F significantly exceeds the historical average high of 81.1‚ÄØ¬∞F (average low 61‚ÄØ¬∞F), highlighting a continued warmth. And with the next few days projected to have highs in the upper 80s to low 90s and lows in the mid‚Äë70s, the trend of above‚Äëaverage summer temperatures is persisting.

The work aims to improve passenger flow and accessibility, which is welcome news for anyone who has navigated the sometimes crowded upstairs corridor or boarded a plane via the aging jet bridges. It‚Äôs a practical investment in making our local airport a smoother travel hub.

[$17M in federal education funding restored to Vermont](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/27/17m-federal-education-funding-restored-vermont/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Upwards of $17 million in school funding for Vermont that was previously cancelled by the Trump administration has now been restored,"" according to WCAX.

After a protracted fight that included a multistate lawsuit, these COVID relief funds are finally back in Vermont‚Äôs hands. School districts had earmarked this money for critical projects, including building renovations and vital summer and after school programs. For local schools struggling with tight budgets, this restoration provides some much needed breathing room.

[Burlington businesses team up to keep Grateful Dead tradition alive](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/skinny-pancake-einsteins-tap-house-grateful-dead-burlington/65252127?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Instead of competing with each other, Einstein's and The Skinny Pancake said they chose to come together to figure out how to make each series work and bring local music back downtown,"" reports myNBC5.

This is a classic Burlington story of collaboration over competition. With Nectar‚Äôs temporarily closed, both The Skinny Pancake (hosting free Friday shows) and Einstein‚Äôs (hosting Tuesday shows) independently moved to save the weekly Dead tribute nights. Their decision to coordinate efforts ensures a beloved musical tradition continues uninterrupted, strengthening the downtown music scene.

[Free seven-day meal boxes available for Vermont kids this summer](https://www.wcax.com/2025/06/30/free-meal-boxes-available-vermont-kids/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Starting at the end of July, children can get a weekly meal box with seven breakfasts and seven lunches,"" says WCAX.

The Burlington School District is expanding its summer food program to offer these substantial meal boxes, available to any child under 18 regardless of their town or state. This initiative provides a significant resource for families, ensuring kids have consistent access to meals throughout the week. Pickups are scheduled for three Wednesdays at the Intervale Center, starting July 30th.

[Brandon artist Will Kasso Condry wins prestigious Herb Lockwood Prize](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/arts-culture/will-kasso-condry-receives-12th-annual-herb-lockwood-prize-43834814?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Winners must also have gone to great lengths to uplift and engage others in their art, a mark Kasso Condry has hit throughout his career,"" notes Seven Days.

This is a major, and well deserved, recognition for an artist who has become deeply embedded in Vermont‚Äôs creative landscape. Kasso Condry‚Äôs Afrofuturist murals and community art projects, often created with his wife Jennifer Herrera Condry through their Juniper Creative Arts collective, are vibrant fixtures across the state. The $10,000 prize honors not just his artistic talent but his profound commitment to collaborative, community focused creation.

""Two businesses walked away with cash awards, and all will receive professional services from local businesses worth tens of thousands of dollars,"" according to VermontBiz.

The annual celebration of local entrepreneurship saw Vship, a vehicle shipping platform, win the $15,000 grand prize. Xander Medical, a surgical device company, took home the $5,000 Audience Choice Award. The event highlights the strength of Vermont‚Äôs startup ecosystem and the robust support network helping new businesses get off the ground.

""Last season, Vermont Green announced a permanent women‚Äôs squad is a matter of when, not if,"" writes VTDigger.

Following another pair of successful and sold out exhibition matches, the path toward a professional women's soccer team in Burlington looks clearer than ever. With World Cup winner Sam Mewis at the helm as coach, the events drew huge crowds and showcased a deep well of community support. The success reinforces the idea that Vermont is more than ready to become a destination for women's professional soccer.

[Climate change brings new crops like rice and peaches to Vermont farms](https://vtdigger.org/2025/06/29/the-surprising-shifts-climate-change-is-bringing-to-vermont-farms-rice-paddies-peaches-and-saffron/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-june-30th-4th-of-july-edition)

""Vermont‚Äôs farmers are growing crops that better suit the state‚Äôs warmer and wetter climate ‚Äî and branching into products that provide income even when traditional crops fail,"" reports VTDigger.

This piece explores the fascinating and necessary adaptations Vermont farmers are making in response to our changing climate. Milder winters are making peach crops more reliable, while wetter conditions have led some to experiment with rice paddies in flood prone areas.

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today‚Äôs picks:

Five more to help you make the most of every last bit of summer. Take a walk through the University of Vermont campus, where old trees, quiet pathways, and historic buildings make it an underrated spot for a midday reset. Visit the Vermont Comedy Club downtown and see what‚Äôs on the calendar. Whether it‚Äôs stand-up, improv, or open mic night, there‚Äôs usually something worth a few laughs. Head to North Beach in the early evening when the crowds thin out and the light softens, perfect for a swim or just sitting by the water. Browse the shelves at ReSource or Dirt Chic for secondhand gems, whether you're looking for clothes, furniture, or just something unexpected. And if you're in the mood for music, check the schedule at Radio Bean and see who‚Äôs playing that night.

# This Week‚Äôs Restaurant Review: Hen of the Wood

Nestled inside Hotel Vermont, Hen of the Wood offers a sophisticated, farm-to-table dining experience that has become a standard-bearer in Burlington‚Äôs culinary scene. The ambiance strikes a balance between rustic charm and urban elegance, with dark wood and an intimate setting that echoes its original Waterbury location. This commitment to Vermont extends to its menu, which changes daily to showcase the freshest seasonal ingredients from a dedicated network of local farmers, ranchers, and artisans, creating a true taste of the region.

The menu‚Äôs reliance on seasonal availability means there are always new dishes to explore, but certain signature items have become beloved mainstays. The hen-of-the-woods mushroom toast with a poached egg is a consistently praised favorite, as are the simple yet perfect Parker House rolls with cultured butter. While the quality of the ingredients shines through in every dish, from fresh oysters to local cheeses, this dedication to premium, locally-sourced food comes at a cost, positioning it firmly in the upscale dining category with entrees often ranging from $35 to $45.

While Hen of the Wood has earned numerous accolades, including James Beard nominations for its chef and recognition as a top spot for business dinners, the experience isn't without its potential downsides. The restaurant's popularity can lead to a bustling and sometimes noisy atmosphere, which might not suit those seeking a quiet, intimate meal during peak hours. Securing a reservation can also be a challenge, but for a special occasion or a taste of expertly crafted, quintessentially Vermont cuisine, the consensus is clear: Hen of the Wood delivers a memorable and worthwhile culinary adventure.

1lp03os,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarK/comments/1lp03os/spoilers_s3_i_think_this_show_is_kinda_bad_change/,[Spoilers S3] I think this show is kinda bad. Change my mind.,"Well I did finish the series so it's not *that* bad, but vaaastly overrated.

Look, I know I'm coming to a sub where people love the show, on a website where disliking someone's favored media is a mortal sin. (And fair warning, I'm kind of snarky because it's more fun that way.) But I'm not saying anyone's wrong to like it. And I mean what I said with ""change my mind"". If my criticisms are inaccurate or unimportant, I'm game to understand what I missed. 

That said, I think the writing was pretty bad and will explain why:

# 1: Technoblather that made me facepalm harder than Ulrich hit Helge

Someone really should travel back in time and tell writers that the technobabble makes everything worse. It doesn't sound good and it's not necessary.

Say that characters travel through a cave and come out in a different year and that's fine. I'm on board. But no, they couldn't leave it. **A fission reactor detected a (fist-sized) god particle that creates dark matter which functions as an Einstein-Rosen bridge across a black hole. And also quantum entangles another dimension like Schr√∂dinger's Cat.**

Oh, and the time travel is 33 years because that's when the lunar calendar syncs back up with the solar calendar. (But we'll ignore that after it's too restrictive to resolve this mess.)

I guess I admire their restraint for not cramming ""blockchain"" in there somewhere.

# 2: Actually the fact that they're all inbred makes a lot of sense.

Kids are missing. There are notable nearby caves that kids often visit. But no one figures they should, y'know, explore them or anything. Any sensible community would either seal it off or have it mapped the first time anyone gets lost. This town is like ""eh, let's interview one of the mothers again.""

Also people are really slow to recognize faces or figure out context clues. There's a saying among writers that ""audiences love slow thinkers,"" and that's because it allows the audience time to get ahead of them. But it's over the top. 

Like 3x01. I'll forgive Jonas having trouble grasping that he's in a world where he wasn't born. George Bailey didn't get it that quickly either. But c'mon. He goes to the classroom where his peers are, because it's the same class with the same teacher that he knew. And then afterwards he has to ask what year it is? If I found myself in my 11th grade History class I'd have a lot of questions. But ""What year was I a HS Junior?"" wouldn't be among them.

One they get over the long initial period of being dumbfounded, the characters sure lose all their skepticism though. 

e.g. Jonas wants to stop his dad dying and accepts that he wouldn't be born. Then Claudia walks in (somehow knowing he was there) and says it isn't better that way. And Jonas says ""OK lady I've never met, I'll abandon my plan to save the world now."" (Yes, I know he was thrown by what Michael said. Doesn't change anything.)

Which leads me to...

# 3: OK Boomer

Adam (and Eva, and Claudia) lived long lives with lots happening. And I'm willing to believe they have a perfect memory of it all, including dialogue and timing, even for things they weren't part of. That way they can trigger others (or their earlier selves) to do it again. But still it's just one life each. They're not Dr. Strange. They're not an expert in every possibility. Yet when one of them says ""It has to be this way"" or ""this is the final loop"", it's accepted with the weight of someone who knows everything.

Now they *could* have used the big pointless meeting room to show that they've documented lots of cross-dimensional attempts somehow. Some ledger that's thousands of years old because it keeps getting sent back in time. That's less hard to swallow than a lot of what we got, and much more useful than just having a place to hang Adam and Eve paintings. Maybe they could have squeezed it into the runtime by cutting out the 13yo love triangle and sex scene.

Claudia's journal came closest. She's smart and proactive and she put a focus on studying the situation. But if that needs to contain bombshells like ""the baby Charlotte that disappeared and the baby Charlotte that appeared are actually the same baby"", there's not a lot of room for details like ""Life 217: put birth control pill in Hannah's coffee. Didn't work.""

But they didn't even lean in on that. They had the chance in the finale, when Adam asks what everyone should have asked all along: ""How do you know?"" Then via the next 12 hours of voiceover we get the plodding explanation ""I spent 33 years looking ... there were puzzle pieces ... over and over ... same family tree ... both worlds are cancer ... came from someone else ... there's another ... an outsider ... "" 

That doesn't answer how you know. Again, I'm on reddit. I know what it looks like when someone claims expertise and then avoids questions about it. ""I know because I know"". Claudia might as well have said ""Um, why don't you go Google it?""

And that wouldn't explain stuff like Eva *not* being shot and saying ""It never happens like this"". Oh, did the script say that? How the heck do you know Zombie Mads doesn't come shoot you in 2 minutes? For that matter, why did Adam even do the gun fakeout? At least Eva explained that she found her own body and intuited the rest. Who told Adam what he was ""supposed"" to do at this time?

# 4: Oh you're not even following your own rules.

There's an explanation about two worlds tied together, using the infinity symbol, that almost made sense. A time loop can be alternating and still be fixed. A classic example would be that I go back in time to stop my parents meeting. Thus I'm not born, so I can't go back, so they do meet, so I'm born, so I can go. Various time travel theories would have to deal with this paradox, but in a multiverse theory you just get an alternating pattern. That's fine.

Except the show already *had* two worlds, and then used this to say that Jonas can be shot but also be alive. Yeah no, that's a 3rd world right there if you have alternate paths. You can have a third world if you want. But then you can't act like the Triquetra means anything when you want to end with yet another divergent path. (It doesn't mean anything anyway.)

And it's completely unnecessary. The show didn't have to shoot him, only to retcon that he's also still alive. And then it tried to claim the plot armor was also fate armor, as if introducing the idea of ""some things can't be changed"" helps the story in any way. Not only does ""You can't kill me"" contradict ""you can kill me but Schr√∂dinger's Cat kept me alive"", they're both stupid. 

(If you *really* want to resolve it with this multiverse theory, every time the gun misfired could be considered a new ""world"" and we just followed the story where Jonas survived. But that further undermines the ""two paths"" nonsense.)

# 5: Yadda yadda yadda I'm really tired today

All the pivotal stuff basically happens off-screen, with only the tiniest nod shown. In order to have Adam and Jonas at odds, or Eva and Marta, there must be some crucial turn where the younger character decides that they were wrong and the older person who lied to them / shot their lover is actually the person they want to be. That's huge. It's probably the biggest character moment in the entire show. Where's the giant unforgettable scene where that happened? No room for that I guess. But I got long chants of ""The end is the beginning ... and the beginning is the end ... we will birth them and they will birth us ... the cycle remains intact"".

Or this divide between Claudia and Adam (and I'm not even clear if Eva was a third side). That's huge. It should have been central and clear how both were opposing viewpoints. We were told *that* they oppose. Light and darkness. Claudia was apparently the ""White Devil"". Maybe we could have witnessed this ideological struggle instead of ""something vague"" vs ""something else vague"". They could still keep secrets. I'm not saying Adam's plan for a cosmic abortion had to be stated in advance. But give us something to define the points of view.

# 5: The emperor is naked. And rambling incoherently

When you have 30 characters, each with 2-5 versions, it's understandable to get confused. I think they could have done more to clarify it. Like throwing names into dialogue more. Or replacing the kaleidoscope intro with a family tree type of graphic. But I'm not annoyed by that, because like you I signed up for an intricate show that benefits from rewatch.

Instead, I think that this reasonable confusion encourages people to give the show undeserved leeway for all the above nonsense. Like ""Oh, well I was confused whether that character was Hannah or Silja or middle-aged Marta, so maybe it's my fault that I spent the whole series not seeing why Adam hates Claudia.""  And I just want to say that if anyone has ever thought ""This plot is smarter than me"", well no it isn't. 

There are elements that have promise. Time travel is fun. The ultimate idea that all this is a side effect to Tannhaus is pretty interesting**\***. Pornhub has a whole section on incest so clearly there's a fanbase.  I like the playing at religion with the biblical names. Adam and Eve are a bit obvious, but points for not stopping there. Noah was gathering the select people. Jonas is presumably Jonah, who tried to escape his fate and suffered for it. Hannah prayed for a son and promised him to God.  Martha is ... Superman's mother? I don't know if it holds up past there.

My point is not that there's anything wrong with liking it. In some ways it's a puzzle, and I understand the appeal. But it gets spoken of as a ""masterpiece"" and one of the greatest shows of all time, and it just isn't. This isn't even the best Sci-Fi series I watched in the last month. (Andor. Don't @ me.) 

# 6: I'll shut up soon

I don't even like the title. What does ""Dark"" have to do with anything? It should have been called ""The Travelers"". Or ""Sic Mundus"". Or ""How I Met My Aunt."" It's all like one person came up with the name. Another had a cave idea. Someone later wanted an apocalypse. And eventually some guy had to tie it up. And if so, kudos to that last person.



But like I said up top, I didn't seek out fans to tell them they're wrong. I watched in German so it's entirely plausible I missed something. I never read that Goethe novel they referenced so maybe that ties it all together. If someone can explain to me why the things that seem vague and contradictory are actually necessary, I'm open to it. I would appreciate the attempt to change my mind.

(But nobody's going to convince me that referencing the ""god particle"" wasn't stupid.)



**\* Addendum:**

Actually I don't want to damn it with faint praise by calling this part interesting. The core idea (as I understand it is):



Tannhaus is distraught after losing his family. He builds a time machine that will eventually cause an apocalypse. In attempting to prevent it, eventually someone has the idea to give him his book so he builds the machine on their schedule, and a baby so he doesn't need to travel himself. Unfortunately the catastrophe still happens, and now there's a looping bootstrap paradox so you can't look at the existing world and tell how it all started. The story works from the inside out so the idea that nothing in the loop actually matters to the original problem is a difficult conclusion to reach - especially for a person who only exists in that loop.

I think that's really cool. But it needed to be fleshed out, clarified, and cleaned up. Which incidentally is what I said about Tenet. Both had clever time travel ideas. Both needed a lot of polish.

1lp02sx,https://i.redd.it/l9pw76sb89af1.jpeg,Connecting the dots,"I finished my Quad therapy on June 16th. The first week I honestly felt better than before. Better than when I finished my first round of antibiotics(triple failed). 

During my first week I won't lie I was hungry af and was eating cheese and bread, sweet potato chips I thought were safe. And boom last week it crashed on me. Last week my burning sensation came back with nausea. I was so anxious (I haven't retested) that im still positive. I'm testing in July 21st. 

So now to the main part. I've read people's experience after treatment and how they feel worst than before and the answer is GASTRITIS. So many people's endoscopy before and after H pylori point to them having gastritis and it's no wonder because once we start to feel the symptoms of H pylori like nausea, heartburn, acid reflux that's when H pylori has done its damage and has inflamed our gut lining. 

I feel sorry for the many here who were just put on PPIs and now H pylori can't be detected because of the PPIs affecting test results. All because of the doctors just giving them PPIs for their gastric problems. 

 Now last week I read a book called ""The Gastritis Healing Book"" by L.G Capellan and honestly yeah it's been helpful. He explains that we must test for H pylori as it's the main factor of Gastritis too. Especially after we take antibiotics our stomach lining is messed up. Our stomach acid begins to try and act like before but due to an inflamed stomach lining the acid burns our lining causing that pain everyone here gets post treatment. Since also we can't just come off the PPIs right away. Sadly also if H pylori isn't even dead after antibiotics it'll only keep on causing gastritis. 

I'm about 5 days in on gastritis diet and it's been real helpful. Occasional flare ups but they pass and well the books says a minimum of 90 days to even begin a base healing process and flare ups will come but that doesn't mean you're not healing. To not be discourage if flare ups do come. No gluten no dairy for the 90 days they can be reintroduced once a based healing has been formed. 

What I'm doing it's eating only chicken breast and fish. Only using avocado oil but must be mindful of no more that 15 grams of fat per meal. Protien is harder to digest so eating a palm full of protien is better. Also eat Whole Foods in general like veggies but in the books he lists what's good to eat and not good to eat because. Eating small meals throughout the day as well. 

So much to say of this book it must really be read by everyone to make their own plan as we are all different. I listen to the audio book on Spotify but it's not much expensive to buy the book I just couldn't wait for the book to come in so I wrote down my notes. 

I have so much written down but if interested I can send my notes to you. I have bad hand writing lol ",1,1751372064.0,HPylori,0,0.67,False

The usual story - colleges friends spread all over the country, others gone abroad, drifted due to different circumstances etc.. 

Don't want to let the summer go by again and not do much.

Wanted to get up a group based in Wexford or surrounding counties, to meet up for coffee, lunch, walks, cinema etc. 

I'm 32F but my husband, 30, would be interested too  so men or women of a similar age. 
Anyone interested?
