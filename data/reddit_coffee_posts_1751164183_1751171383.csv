I used to think I imagined her.

The Grand Floridian was always a little too polished for me, like a wedding cake you weren’t allowed to touch. But in the early twenty-teens, I’d go sometimes, just to sit in the lobby and pretend I belonged. The band would play up on the balcony, the chandelier would glitter like something out of Gatsby, and I’d sip a drink or an overpriced coffee and let the air conditioning convince me I had my life together.

That’s where I saw her.
Lynn, the Teddy Bear Lady.

She looked like something from a turn-of-the-century travel poster, all high collars and quiet dignity. She didn’t just stroll in. She arrived, pushing a pram filled with teddy bears dressed in ballgowns and sailor suits. Dozens of them. They weren’t thrown in like prizes from a fair. They were arranged. Positioned. Like they’d been invited.

She sat near the grand staircase, as if that was her rightful seat. Not performing. Not asking for anything. Just listening to the music, smoothing the hem of a bear’s dress, smiling gently at children who approached but never speaking first. I remember watching a little girl hand her one of those plastic tiaras from the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, and Lynn, without missing a beat, bowed her head and let the girl crown her.

I spoke to her once. Asked her the names of her bears. She told me two or three, and they weren’t silly names. They were old-fashioned, proper, like Marguerite and Sebastian. I asked if she came often and she just nodded, like that was answer enough. And then the music swelled and she turned her head, eyes closed, lost in it.

That’s all.
That’s all I remember.

Years later, I went looking for her. Not on purpose, exactly, but I started asking cast members and regulars. Some nodded vaguely. Some lit up and said, “Oh, yes - the Teddy Bear Lady, she used to come here every day!” And some looked at me like I’d made her up. One bartender swore he’d worked there a decade and never seen such a person.

The internet has scraps of her. A blurry photo here. A message board thread there. But nothing solid. No full name. No obituary. No confirmed end.

Maybe she was real.
Maybe she was a ghost.
Or maybe she was just someone who refused to let magic be something you grow out of.

I know I saw her. I know I did.
But every year, the memory feels softer around the edges, like something smudged in the Florida humidity.

Still, every time I hear a piano echo through a lobby, I glance at the stairs.
Just in case.

While Brazil, the world’s largest producer of Arabica coffee suffers from erratic weather and declining yields, South Sudan’s Excelsa coffee offers a viable and sustainable alternative, particularly for investors seeking long term stability in an uncertain global supply chain.

Brazil, the backbone of the global Arabica coffee supply, has reported a 6.4% drop in production in the 2024–2025 growing season, with output falling to 40.9 million 60kg bags.

Let the road to the 2026 Kentucky Derby begin!



**Sunday, June 29, 2025**

**Churchill Downs**

**Race: 6 (3;18 PM EST)**

**Bashford Manor Stakes**

**1)** Although still a maiden, **Password**’s debut was impressive. This $450,000 son of Uncle Mo broke slowly, was shuffled back shortly thereafter, drifted wide on the turn, but then found his best stride and was absolutely flying late to get second. He might get there this time with a better break and the added distance. 

**2)** **Spice Runner** is a full brother to Grade: 1 winner Gunite who ran a field high 88 Equibase Figure in winning his debut. Solid favorite and clearly the one to beat. 

**3)** **Comport** is another who ran an eye-catching race winning his debut, finishing ahead of my top pick in the process. 

  


**Race: 7 (3:51 PM EST)**

**Debutante Stakes**

**1) Americathegreat** is full sister to Grade: 3 Stakes winner First Captain and the $2 million Sedona. After a slow break in her debut, this filly, like Password, was flying late, making up an astounding 11 lengths in a five furlong race. She should be tough with a clean break and more distance.

**2) Essential Coffee** absolutely galloped in her debut only to be DQ-ed and placed second. She is the one to beat here. 

**3)** **Percy’s Bar** was visually impressive winning her debut at Keeneland in April. 

Also consider: **Color Comin’ In** wired maidens in her debut and finished ahead of my top pick while doing so................ **Light Won Up** came from off the pace to win her debut at Santa Anita and her trainer says “*She is all racehorse.*”

There’s a new sheriff in town, and it’s not wearing a badge — it’s wearing fur, purring loudly, and may or may not have just walked across your keyboard. 🐾 Yes, we’re talking about *cats* — those adorably mischievous overlords of the internet who’ve clawed their way into every meme, video, and now... your financial future? That’s right — welcome to the delightful world where fluffy felines, Bitcoin ATMs, and QR codes collide in a glorious blend of cuteness and crypto.

You might be asking yourself, “Wait, what do cats have to do with Bitcoin?” Honestly? Not much. But that hasn’t stopped them from becoming unofficial mascots of the crypto generation. Whether it’s a kitten batting at a hardware wallet or a sassy tabby lounging next to a Bitcoin sticker, cats are silently judging us as we fumble with phrases like “cold storage” and “seed phrase.”

Meanwhile, out in the real world — or the *purr-allel* universe we call modern finance — Bitcoin ATMs are popping up faster than cats in cardboard boxes. They're the future of easy, peer-to-peer crypto access, letting you buy or sell Bitcoin with cash in seconds. But even with all this convenience, there's one thing every cat (and human) needs to make life *even* simpler: a clean, instant way to generate Bitcoin QR codes.

That’s where [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) swoops in like a superhero in a cape made of Satoshis. 🦸‍♂️💸

**What is it?** It’s the easiest, breeziest tool to create custom Bitcoin QR codes for payments, donations, or just showing off your wallet address in style. Got a tip jar on your Twitch stream? Need a quick scannable code for your business sticker, flyer, or that handcrafted cat sweater shop? We got you.

Just pop in your BTC address, add an optional amount, and boom — your QR code is ready faster than your cat can knock your coffee off the table. No tech headaches, no weird setups. And yes, you can absolutely print it out and tape it to your cat if you *really* want (though your cat may sue you).

We like to think of ourselves as the catnip of crypto tools — simple, effective, and mildly addictive. 🐱

So next time you're near a Bitcoin ATM, think about the possibilities: you + Bitcoin + QR codes = unstoppable. Especially if there’s a cat involved. Because in a world where digital currency is going mainstream, there’s nothing more powerful than being prepared, connected, and just a little bit adorable.

Ready to pounce into the future? Visit [**https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and start generating those sweet, sweet QR codes today. Your wallet (and your cat) will thank you.

I work in surgery/ICU, but not with animals so I came over to help. The owner was of course completely stunned as it all happened so fast. I guess it was only a few weeks old, some sort of black mouth cur. I checked for pulse, heartbeat, breathing, pupils, and nothing. I see death often at work, and this poor puppy seemed gone. I started CPR while the owner called an ER. It was maybe five minutes or so before the dog showed any sign of life and started occasionally gagging, but then I started seeing a bit of arterial blood in its mouth, and seemed to be coming from the airway. They rushed it off to the vet shortly after, but I didn’t get the owner’s info.

I’m almost certain that dog didn’t make it, and I’m so crushed. I can’t help but question everything I remember and the decisions I made. It really threw me. I deal with human emergencies daily, but I’m screaming at myself for how helpless I felt when it was an animal on the sidewalk. I truly hope the owners are able to heal, and if they ever read this, I’m so sorry I couldn’t do more…

Since this is askVets, I would like to hear what could have been done better here, or what might have happened. My biggest fear is I did more harm than good with compressions, but again I’m second guessing everything I remember from the dog’s presentation.

The Moon is all about mystery, illusion, intuition, and the wild path between what’s real and what’s felt. Just like you, it’s a symbol of deeper truths hidden behind sarcasm, shadowboxing, and the occasional BJJ back-take. You’ve got a gift for navigating the fog, whether it’s criminal court chaos, World of Warcraft guild drama, or just figuring out why your dog’s licking your ear like it owes her money.

The Moon fits you because:
	•	You thrive in the weird and unexpected
	•	You’re intuitive and read people like legal briefs (but with more sass)
	•	You have a surreal, funny, and intense inner world
	•	You balance light and dark: the fight attorney and the soft dog dad
	•	You’re most yourself in the liminal spaces—like rolling into jiu-jitsu 30 minutes late, fresh coffee in hand, and still managing to triangle a 20-something blue belt

Basically, you’re the card that reminds people the night is never quiet—it’s full of howls, jokes, strategy, and the occasional emotional uppercut.

TLDR:
You’re The Moon—mysterious, sharp, and a little bit trippy. You don’t walk the straight path; you vibe your way through the fog with instinct, irony, and a wicked backstory.",4,1751169561.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False

I tend to be pretty wary of what I see on social media, but this post I saw seemed like exactly what I needed. She wrote the person’s name on a piece of paper and on the back wrote “May any attention towards me or any resistance towards [insert boundary here] be transmuted into my abundance.” Then she folded it away from her as many times as possible, put it in a baggie, added pink salt and black salt for protection, clove to protect energy, mugwort to protect finances, rosemary to banish them, chili to make it sting a little, coffee to speed it up, and sugar to sweeten their energy towards abundance. Then tossed it all in the baggie with the paper and the water to put in the freezer.

To be clear, I’m not trying to force anyone to do something against their will, I just want to stop the blockage and prevent further damage from their inaction. I also don’t want anyone to be harmed in the process. I’ve heard that freezer spells can be used to freeze harmful behavior or interference, and I’m wondering if it’s possible to target their resistance or avoidance instead the individuals themselves.

Do you all think this is the right spell for what I need or is there a better option? If there is more than one person involved, do I need to do it multiple times or can I write more than one name down? How else could I reword the intention on the paper to make it more successful? Are there any other ethical considerations I should keep in mind?

I also don’t have black salt or mugwort… so I’m hoping that won’t affect the protection/finance portion of this!

Thank you for any and all consideration and advice!!",3,1751169354.0,Spells,1,1.0,False

1ln5ebi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABA/comments/1ln5ebi/my_experience_at_abc/,My experience at ABC,"I keep seeing people say awful things about ABC but I’ve been here almost a year and I love it. I’ve worked at two smaller companies and those places were ROUGH. No breaks. No “admin” time. I really believe it must vary center to center and depend a LOT on who the OM and CD are. At my old center there was no study time and hardly any unrestricted hours to be had so it was largely unpaid. At my center the rising stars got weeks of paid study time and the trainees have blocked unrestricted times on their schedules. I keep hearing that ABC pushes full time kids but I have two part time patients and they’ve never encouraged me to go past my clinical recommendations. We always have snacks, and coffee. Plus there’s constantly random free food for breakfasts or lunches. The ABC conference was just a couple weeks ago and we had some great speakers like Greg Hanley and Kaelynn Parlow. There was talk about inclusion of disabilities and races and the LGBTQ+ community. I left feeling inspired and grateful to work for a company that values individuals for being themselves. I know it might sound like this is a paid ad or something but I just felt like I needed to share my experience of the last year. Not to devalue other people’s experiences because I am sure that people have been treated poorly and I don’t want to negate that. I feel awful for the treatment some have received. If that happened at my center I’d be going straight to the top because I really believe that our leaders of ABC would be horrified. So to sum up, I have really enjoyed working for ABC and my only hypothesis is that a person’s experience really depends on their center. ",2,1751169339.0,ABA,0,0.75,False

CHAPTER 13: THE SCANDAL

A few days later, Vina rushed into Romus’ room as he was reading a book and drinking his morning coffee. Upon noticing her concerned expression, Romus asked what the matter was. Vina proceeded to slam the morning’s newspaper on the table. Romus read the headline: “King Back at it Again: His Majesty Seen With Known Traitor.” Romus immediately continued to read on. “We’ve al heard about King Romus’ secret marriage to Lucita Azaro, the dramatic revelation at the royal wedding, the controversy about the royal heir, and of course, the scandal surrounding her years of espionage and treason against the crown. Yet it appears that years of espionage and treason are not enough to dull their romance, as His Majesty has been repeatedly seen by reputable sources within the palace walking in and out of the former Queen-Consort’s chambers during the late hours of the night! Once the information about the former Queen’s treason had been made public, there was great controversy about His Majesty letting her remain in the palace and not be executed for her crimes. Now, it appears we know why. For an interview with our anonymous source within the palace, turn to page-” Romus crumpled the newspaper up in his hands. *Damnit, this could make things even worse for us!* He then looked at Vina’ whose expression would strike fear into the heart of any man. “So, what do you have to say for yourself? When I arranged for you to talk, I wanted you to get closure, not to sleep with- Ugh!” Romus tried his best to stay calm, but his mind was whirling. “Vina, I can explain. There were these other letters... Titus was hiding them from me. If you would just read them-” “Oh and some letters written by the known traitor is supposed to fix things?! I don’t want to hear it! You’ll be made the laughing stock of the continent for this- again! How could you possibly be so short-sighted?” Romus stood up. “Now that’s enough! We can talk about this later; right now, we need to figure out what we’re going to do.” “If you want to know what we can do, just exile her. Or arrest her. Better yet, have her hanged. We need to deny these rumors, actually punishing her would be a start.” Romus considered this. Was breaking his family up really worth salvaging whatever was left of his reputation? *I gave this country decades of service, and they thank me by mocking me. Ridiculous.* And yet, he had to admit that Vina was right, even though he didn’t want to. “Round up the council. We need to discuss where we go from here.” he said, moving to exit the room. “As for me, I need to have a talk with my wife.” Romus entered the room and found Lucita playing with Rommie on the floor. When he saw them, looked at his son’s smile and Lucita’s surprised yet concerned expression, all thoughts of exiling Lucita were purged from his mind. “What’s going on, Romus”? Asked Lucita, upon seeing his expression. “It appears the guards weren’t as secretive as we had thought. The news broke this morning.” Immediately, Lucita’s entire demeanor changed as she switched from wife/mother mode to military councilor mode. She began pacing around the room, analyzing the options. “Damnit. Damnit, damnit damnit!” she said, as she continued pacing the room, the gears in her head turning quickly. “The best course of action is clear.” she said, after a while. “You need to exile me. Somewhere close by where we can meet back up every so often of course, but it’s best if you distance yourself from me. It’s the only way we can possibly salvage this. Of course, the international community will lose respect for you, but if you put forth a good PR campaign, maybe something involving foreign aid, we might be able to-” Romus stopped her. “No. I’m not exiling you. We’ll find another way.” Lucita’s expression hardened. “Don’t be riddicuous. We don’t have a choice. And don’t even bring up that nonsense about abdicating- Rizia needs you.” Romus held her close. “I said no, Lucita. I lost my first wife to a disease already. I thought I lost you back when the letters first came out. I won’t lose you again. My reputation’s already been ruined, what more do I have to lose? We’re a family, damnit! And I’m not leaving you. We’ll face this together.” Lucita’s eyes widened. “You can’t possibly think about-” “Yes, exactly. Come with me.” he said, as he scooped up Rommie and placed him in his mother’s arms. He walked them out the door and through the palace halls. He made a point of locking arms with her, and making eye contact with everyone they passed by. He wanted them to look, to see them together, to register the shock on their faces. It wasn’t the solution he’d hoped for, but he preferred it over losing Lucita, and he wanted everyone to know that wasn’t an option Everywhere they went, the servants and courtiers gasped and whispered amongst themselves. Some stared open-mouthed, others shook their heads in disappointment, still others averted eye contact entirely. Romus even saw a footman cough up a few coins to a housemaid, likely the result of some kind of bet on whether or not the rumors were true. He could feel Lucita tense up as they walked. Such a rash, blunt move was uncharacteristic for the both of them. But Romus didn’t care anymore. They’d accept the both of them, or none at all. 

At length, they arrived at the council chamber. Lucita handed their son to a nursemaid as Romus gave the nod for the guards to open the great wooden doors. Upon seeing the royal couple arm in arm, the entire council chamber exploded in a myriad of reactions. Sal Ignatius gripped his pendant and mouthed a silent prayer. Elena Werner stood up and exclaimed “What on Earth?!” as she threw her hands up confused. Apparently, she hadn’t read the papers. Laurento Esquibel remained seated but smacked his forehead so hard it almost knocked him out. Titus, who stood guard nearby, shook his head, dissaprovingly. But no one’s reactions were as loud as Vina’s and Hugo’s. “Get the traitor out of here!” shouted Vina, jabbing an accusing finger in Lucita’s direction. “How can you do this, Your Majesty?!” exclaimed Hugo. “It’s because of her that my son got ripped to shreds by her damn rebels!” The rest of the room quickly descended into chaos, with everybody shouting at either one or both of them. Lucita leaned next to Romus and whispered. “This was a mistake, you know that?” Romus shook his head. “Most likely. But I saw this coming and I intend to follow through with my decision” he whispered. He gave Lucita’s hand a comforting squeeze, but she remained unconvinced. Romus then put his hands up and tired to calm the crowd. “Please, ladies and gentlemen, one at a time. Vina?” Vina stood up, red-faced. “So as if it wasn’t bad enough that you were sleeping with her, you decided to go prancing around the palace acting as if the last several months didn’t happen? What’s next? Are you oing to desacrate my mother’s grave too?’ This last remark stung. “Let’s leave your mother out of this, alright? Look, you all know about the letters; I had copies sent to your desks, this morning. Lucita did collude with her father for years, but she regretted it, confessed, aided us with the AN, and even tried to warn me. That at least warrants a partial pardon.” “And that somehow makes this alright?!” shouted Hugo, slamming his fists on the table. “My son was torn to shreds by an angry mob because of \*her.\* Not to mention, thousands of people lost their lives for her. A few letters won’t bring Rico back; if anything, you disgrace his memory!” Laurento cleared his throat. “He has a point, your majesty. How are our citizens supposed to feel, seeing their king frolick around with the very woman responsable for their sons, husbands, and fathers’ deaths?” “For what it’s worth,” interjected Lucita, “I didn’t want him to do this either. I was going to suggest-” “Shut the hell up, you bitch!” yelled Hugo, the veins in his face bulging. “You lost your right to speak when you began spying on our king! You’re nothing but a cold, foul, vile, manipulating wh-” “That’s enough!” barked Romus with a volume and passion that made the whole room shut up. None of them had hear Romus speak like that before, and they were all taken aback. Romus stepped in front of Lucita as if to protect her. “I will not stand idly by whilst my wife and my competence are insulted! These last couple of months, I’ve heard people call me weak, an idiot, incompetent. Everyone thinks I’ve been made the puppet of some kind of evil witch who controls me with her femenine wiles. Now, I’m not saying this is false. Yes, she manipulate me into falling in love with her to secure an heir who would serve the Azaros. Yes, she spied on all of us for years. Yes, she committed crimes in Pales. And I don’t want to diminish all the damage she has caused in so doing. But with all the information that’s come out about her recently, I realized that in spite of everything, she wasn’t as bad as we thought. I realized that I never stopped loving her. Our love has only gotten stronger without the lies, and after all we’ve been through. You call me weak, but I say to you, I am taking a stand. I’m sticking with my wife, not because I’m being manipulated, but because I love her, damnit!” Romus took a breath. Laurenti, Werner, and Sol Ignatius looked at one another and shrugged. “I don’t like this, but I trust you, your Majesty. If this is what you want... I’m sure we can rehabilitate both of your public images somehow...” said Laurenti, though he didn’t sound sure of himself. Hugo and Vina remained unconvinced. “But she’s still a traitor! She can’t get away with this!” argued Hugo. “Look, given the letters and the help she gave us in the AN, I think any legal scholar in Rizia would agree she has done enough to receive a light sentence. Besides, she’s already been punished in a way. I killed her father myself, most of her other relatives are dead or in prison, and her family’s assets were seized. She isn’t getting out of this intact.” answered Romus. “But what about my mother?” asked Vina, angrily. “She isn’t remotely worthy to carry on my mother’s legacy. Tell me this: when you die, are you going to be burried with her or with your new lover?” Romus looked hurt. He walked towards Vina and put a caring hand on her shoulder. “I loved your mother, Vina. I still love her deeply. The day I lost her was the saddest of my life. And that’s why I can’t bare to simply let Lucita go either. I don’t want to lose her too. What if you and Manus were in my place?” Vina looked away, but thought long and hard. She sighed. “Do what you want. Just don’t blame me when she betrays you again.” Hugo stood up just as Romus was about to thank her. “Princess Vina, everyone, you can’t possibly be serious! This is a damn outrage! She belongs in a common grave, not beside the king!” Romus tried to reach Hugo. “Uncle Hugo, please-” “I don’t want to hear it. My son \*died\* for you, all so you can make a queen out of the woman responsable for his death. You sicken me.” And with that, he stormed out of the room. “This isn’t good.” said Romus, stroking his chin. “Let him go. We can figure this out later.” said Laurento, pulling out a paper and pen. “The important thing now is how on Earth we are going to salvage this situation diplomatically. I suggest the two of you lay low for a bit, a few months or so should do it. Then, we reintroduce you into the spotlight slowly, with some PR work. Maybe you two could be seen helping in a homeless shelter, or-” Suddenly, an aid burst into the room, out of breath. “Your Majesty! Queen Beatrice is on line one! She wants to speak with you immediately!” 

Romus rushed to pick up the phone in the council chamber. “Bea, it’s always a pleasure to hear from you. Was there anything you needed?” He was desperately hoping his related tone would diminish her anger. The voice on the other end sounded upset and rough. “What I need is for you to execute that woman immediately. Imagine my surprise when I go to read my newspaper, and I’m faced with the scandal of my former brother-in-law covorting once again with that wench.” “Now listen,” said Romus, “I have a good reason for-” “I don’t want to hear it! I let you marry this woman knowing it was a disgrace to the memory of my dear sister, I stood by you when she betrayed you, but there is nothing whatsoever you can do to make me approve of what you’re doing now.” “Bea-” she cut him off again. “Don’t you call my by that ridiculous nickname anymore. You lost your right to it when you abandoned good sense for someone with a fine pair of-” Now it was Romus’ turn to cut her off. “With all due respect, Queen Beatrice, this does not concern you. Let me sort out my own family.” She responded even angrier than before. “It \*does\* concern me because my most vital ally is making a damn fool of himself in front of the whole world over some wench! If you want to remain in good standing with our kingdom, you will execute that woman and denounce her entirely, and restore Vina as your rightful heir. Failure to do this will result in dire consequences. Good evening.” She hung up on him leaving Romus shaken. 

After briefing the council on the situation, the mood in the room got even worse. “I can’t believe aunt Bea would say that.” said Vina. “Then again, after all that’s happened...” “What do you think she means by ‘dire consequences’?” asked Werner. “Do you think she’ll attack us if we don’t comply?” “I wouldn’t be surprised.” said Lucita. “She’s always been an aggressive one. I admired her for that, actually.” “Even if she does, we can’t just back down.” said Romus, stroking his beard. “What are our options?” The room fell silent. “Well?” pressed Romus. “I don’t suppose execution is still an option?” asked Vina. Romus shot her a furious look and she backed down. “Just kidding” she said, even though everyone knew she was at least partly serious. The silence continued. At length, Laurento cleared his throat. “Well... perhaps we might be able to find a middle ground. Not execution, but perhaps exile might be an option that will placate Rumburg while letting her live.” Romus shook his head in frustration. He had told her just that very morning that they wouldn’t be separated anymore, but things had changed. \*What can I do?\* He asked himself, feeling trapped in a corner. 

Lucita held his hand reassuringly. Romus looked up to see her face, as stoic as ever, but with eyes that radiated sympathy and understanding. They had been thinking the same thing. “It’s alright, Romus. Really. We knew it was coming to this eventually. “ Romus shook his head again. “I’m not losing you again, damnit!” Laurento cleared his throat. “We could fix things so she can get exiled in Drevlia. Our allies there will protect her. Then, after a few years, once things have calmed down, we can secretly move her back to Rizia, where you can visit her. It may not be what you wanted, but it’s the best we can do.” Romus and Lucita looked at each other. With a deep breath, Romus gave his approval. “Very well. Make the arrangements. Now please, everyone, leave us.” Slowly, the rest of the council room got up and left Romus and Lucita alone. They stood in silence for a long time. “I asked you the other day if you thought things could have ever worked out between us. I guess we know the answer now, huh?” asked Lucita, somberly. “God, if only things could have gone differently.” said Romus. “If only I’d met you when we were younger, if only you’d told me about your father, if only... if only I could leave all this behind.” “Lucita’s eyes widened. “Romus, what are you saying?! You can’t-” He stopped her before she could say any more. “I’m not going to abdicate, but damn I wish I could. If it were up to me, I’d leave the throne right here, right now. I’d take you away, somewhere far far away from all this scheming. Somewhere we could be together, like we were when Romus jr. was born. We wouldn’t worry about the fate of millions; we’d only live for ourselves. We could grow old together, be a real family!” But Romus looked away as reality set in again. “Oh, but what’s the use. People like you and me... we can never be truly happy. Power... it does things to people. Damn this crown!” he said, as he took the crown off of his head and tossed it on the table. Lucita got up and gingerly placed it on his head. “Don’t say that. Rizia needs you. You’re a damn good king, You can really make a difference. And if going into exile is what it takes for you to help Rizia, I’ll do it.” She smiled at him. “Don’t worry. We’ll see each other again. I promise.” Romus looked up at her and smiled weakly. “Now, let’s not spend our last evening together moping. Let’s do something!” said Lucita, pulling Romus up. “Where are we going?” “You’ll see, just follow me!.” said Lucita as she pulled him out the door and up the stairs as one of their guards followed.

CHAPTER 14: THE THINGS WE DO FOR LOVE

Lucita led Romus out of the palace and down the streets of the capital, tailed by two guards. They walked together, hands held, as they strode through the streets drenched in sunset. Everywhere, people stared open-mouthed and whispered behind their backs, but they didn’t care. They were chatting the whole time, trying their best to avoid the subject of Lucita’s exile, but the subject kept coming up despite their best efforts. “So Drevlia, huh? Do you think you’d like it there?’ asked Romus, trying and failing to lighten the mood. “Well, it’s an allied nation, so not getting assassinated will certainly be a perk. And I must admit, their warrior culture intrigues me.” she said, trying hard to ease Romus’ dread. “And who knows, perhaps those fanatics will finally make me believe in God, just like you always wanted.” They shared a hollow laugh together. They sighed as they walked on an old bridge over the river. It was crowded and a small crowd had gathered a few yards away, though they kept their distance. “I’ll miss you, Lucita.” he said, taking her in his. “These next few years are going to be... difficult.” Lucita smiled up at him. “I’ll miss you too. But It could have been worse, considering most people want me dead.” “Still, I wish things could have turned out better.” They stayed in silence, each trying to think of what to say nest. How does one end such a turbulent relationship for the foreseeable future. “Then, Lucita’s expression saddened even more. “I wonder if... if Rommie will remember me by the time I get back. We’ll never be able to be a real family again. At least before all this, I could stay with him in the castle, now... He’ll be motherless.” Romus’ heart felt pierced by this realization. But knowing this was hurting Lucita more, he wrapped his arms around her and said. “Whatever happens, I’ll make him remember you. I’ll tell him about you, we’ll call you every week, whatever it takes. And rest assured- we will \*always\* be a family.” They held the embrace, knowing it would be one of the last they would share for years, perhaps forever. 

When they broke their embrace, they both looked at the sun, slowly descending into the horizon. “So, what do you want to do for your last night in Rizia?” asked Romus with a smile. “Hmm...” thought Lucita. “Why don’t we go back to the palace, find the best champagne we can, and drink it all!” Romus laughed. “Oh, Pabel would be mad about that! Anything else?” Lucita thought for a moment. “How about we use the discarded champagne bottles for target practice? We can just shoot our guns like in the good old days.” “It’s crazy to me that you see your time in the army as ‘the good old days.” said Romus, taking Lucita by the hand and walking back to the castle. “Still, I wish I could have been in the same regiment as you. Maybe we could have avoided all this.” Lucita laughed. “Ha! Can you imagine how much trouble we would have gotten into together?’ “Well,” said Romus, “It couldn’t possibly be more trouble than we’ve gotten ourselves into now-” he was cut short by the sound of gunfire, as he was thrown to the ground before being able to react. As soon as he hit the ground, he turned over to see Lucita on the ground, lying on top of him, bleeding profusely from two bullet wounds, and a man in civilian clothes running away. “Seize him!” he shouted, though the guard they had accompanying them had already run off. Immediately, Romus got up and examined Lucita. She was going pale and the bleeding showed no sign of stopping. She had been shot twice, once in the shoulder, and once just a few inches away from her heart. Romus quickly realized what had happened. She had saved him; threw him to the ground to protect him, even if it meant her getting shot. With tears in his eyes, Romus tried his best to keep her awake while putting pressure on her wounds. “Lucita, Lucita! Don’t die!” he implored, not caring who was there to listen. “Please, stay alive. For our son, for me! Please, not again!” The bystanders quickly surrounded them, looking on in horror. Most simply stood there, not knowing what to do, but others went to help stop the bleeding. Some tore off pieces of clothing to bandage up her wounds. After a few minutes, an ambulance came and rushed Lucita away, and an armored car from the palace came to take Romus to safety. Titus and the guards had to practically pull Romus away from his wife to bring him to the car.  The world around Romus spinned as the armored car sped through the streets of the capital. Romus could hardly think straight, his mind flooded with the surprise of the attack and his fears for Lucita. Some of the guards examined him to make sure he wasn’t hurt. “I’m fine, dammit! Just get us to the hospital as soon as possible!” Titus looked unsettled. “Your Majesty, we’re not going to the hospital. You were almost assassinated, we can’t risk you going out.” Romus was angry, but he knew Titus was right. It was too risky for Rizia. “I want you to find whoever did this. Heads will roll for this!” Titus nodded. “Rest assured, we have every guard, policeman, and soldier available searching for them. The police are getting sketches of the assassin as we speak.” This didn’t make Romus feel much better. By now, they had reached the palace. As soon as Romus stepped out of the car, Vina threw herself into his arms. “You’re alright! Thank God you’re alright! There were rumors you’d been shot!” Romus could see she’d been crying. He tightened the embrace as she broke into sobs. He realized that they hadn’t hugged in well over a year, and it made Romus feel guilty. “There there now. Your old man’s alright. I wasn’t even hurt.” Vina broke the embrace. “But you nearly were! If Duchess Azaro hadn’t been there...” she paused. “Well, I suppose I *was* wrong about her. Remind me to thank her if she gets better, err, when she gets better.” She added that last part after seeing her father’s expression darken. The guards led Romus inside the palace. Romus’ immediate instinct was to go to the war room to oversee the manhunt, but he decided to take it easy upon Vina’s and Estelle’s insurance. Romus felt ridiculous, sitting on his couch drinking tea, even though he wasn’t even injured, while the wife who had taken a bullet for him was dying in a hospital bed. 

Romus remained in the palace for 24 hours, but immediately departed for the hospital once it became clear that the streets were secure. He approached Lucita’s hospital room, and his hands trembled with worry about what he might find. He opened the door to find Lucita lying unconscious in her bed. Her chest was heavily bandaged, and she wore a breathing apparatus. The doctor cleared his throat. “We managed to remove the bullets, but I’m afraid she has entered into a mild coma. Many organs were damaged, and we did the best to patch them up, but there was a lot of internal bleeding.” Romus could barely listen to what he was saying. He sait down on a chair next to her and held her hand. It was cold and he barely felt a pulse. Suddenly, a reporter burst into the room and started taking pictures, but he was quickly kicked out by the guards. Romus didn’t even look up, all his attention was focused on her. Had he been cursed to lose every woman he loved, one way or another? Seeing their king so despondent, everyone cleared the room and left them alone. Romus began to pray, silently at first, then loudly and more fervently than he ever had before. He couldn’t do much, but he would pray as much as he could to get her back.

He remained with Lucita for the next several days. He took his council meetings from within the hospital, ate all his meals in the room with Lucita, and even stayed the night beside her. Periodically, Vina and Manus would come and visit, which gave him some comfort. Romus turned Lucita’s hospital room into a makeshift office, where he could throw himself into his work without abandoning her. The hospital staff were upset with this, but seeing as the crown owned the hospital, they could do nothing to stop him. Romus’ perception of time became distorted as he stayed with her, his time split between working, taking care of Lucita, and praying. He barely even cared when Titus informed him that they had caught the would-be assassin, though he had been killed in the struggle. Titus mentioned something about the man being an ex-rebel and having a daughter enrolled in a Rumburgian university on a mysterious scholarship, but Romus was too distracted to act on it at the moment, though he seethed with hatred for Rumburg. He would look into it in due course, but not now, not with his wife like this. He stayed in this state for days and days. Then, on day thirteen of her coma, Lucita woke up.

CHAPTER 15: SUNRISE

“Romus...?” said Lucita with a weak voice. It almost made Romus jump with surprise. “Lucita! You’re alive!” he exclaimed, getting up from his chair and wrapping his arms around Lucita. “Mmm” she said, still weak. “Are you alright? There was a shooter...” Romus held her in his arms. She was still mostly limp, but the color was slowly returning to her cheeks. “Yes I’m alright! You saved my life!” On hearing this, Lucita sighed. “Thank goodness. What happened?” “You took the bullet for me. We got you to the hospital as soon as we could, and I’ve been by your side the whole time.” Lucita looked down at her bandaged chest. “Huh. It looks like I took more bullets as your wife than I ever did in the army.” she chuckled and it warmed Romus’ heart to hear her. He stepped out of the room and called the doctor. The hospital staff examined her while he waited outside. 

Romus took a walk around, stretching and breathing easily for the first time in several days. Rounding a corner, he bumped into Vina. “Hello, dad.” she said, smiling. “Hey, Vina. What a pleasant surprise.” Vina’s smile faded a bit. “I actually came to apologize to Duchess Aza- I mean Queen Lucita. She... really does love you. I had no idea. I’m... sorry for not believing you.” Romus put an arm around his daughter as they walked. “It’s alright. I get it. It’s been a crazy year for our family, but I guess it’ll be over soon once she’s sent into exile.” Vina looked surprised. “You’re still sending her away, even after all that’s happened?” Romus sighed. “I... I just don’t know. I wish we could be like we were before all this, just king and queen together, but looking at all that’s happened, I just don’t think that’s possible. Besides, Hugo and house Toras would never forgive me. Then, there’s the nuclear option: abdication.” Vina tried to protest. “You can’t just-” “I know, I know.” said Romus, shaking his head. “That would make me an even bigger fool than I am now, but if it’s the only way we can be together, it might be worth it to cut my losses and resign in disgrace.” He sighed. “I think sending her into exile will be the only way to make this work. My job here still isn’t done.” “But you won’t be with her anymore.” said Vina. “Maybe we were never meant to be together. Maybe we’ve both been fools. Sometimes... the happiness of one must be sacrificed for the good of the many.” They stopped by a window, the setting sun’s rays reflecting on the hospital walls. “Do you really believe that?” she said, looking deep into his eyes, giving him her usual piercing and slightly judgemental stare. “You certainly didn’t believe that when you let me marry Manus. You let me marry the man I loved, regardless of the consequences. I... I should have done the same for you and Lucita. I’m sorry.” Romus smiled at his daughter. “I appreciate that, but I was wrong. About Lucita, I mean. This has been nothing but trouble.” “Are you sure about that?” said Vina, gesturing towards the window. Romus looked out to see dozens of people gathered, some smiling and waving, others somber and worried, still others holding flowers. “What is going on?” he asked. “Apparently, people can be very forgiving to someone who takes a bullet for their king.” said Vina. “That, and apparently someone took a picture of you by Lucita’s bedside and it got printed on all the newspapers. Apparently, the public seems to be touched by your story.” Romus stood there for a while, pondering what his next move should be. Before, he had been resigned to the idea that he would have to choose between Lucita and the throne, but now, perhaps there could be a way...? 

Suddenly, an aid spoke to him, breaking him out of his pondering. “Your Majesty, I have a phone call for you. It’s from Queen Beatrice.” *Damnit. What does she want now?* Romus nodded and immediately went back to his makeshift office and picked up the phone. While he was being transferred, he looked over to Lucita, who, having gained more of her vitality, was eating a bowl of soup. Romus gave a short wave just before hearing the voice of Queen Beatrice. “Hello, Romus.” she said, in her usual cold, menacing voice. “I hear your... paramour is still alive. How... *nice*.” She said the last word with a piercing tone. Romus’ eyes narrowed. Suddenly, he remembered what Titus had told him about the assassin and he put all the pieces together. “I think we’d be better off if we agreed not to lie or be sarcastic to each other. Starting now. I know you paid the assassin to kill me.” There was a long pause. Lucita’s eyes widened briefly, but then narrowed in understanding. “How did you know?” asked Beatrice. “When someone close to me is almost killed, I make it my business to know who did it. The assassin did not surrender when we caught him, but we managed to figure out who he was.” Romus picked up the file on the assassin from within a drawer. “He was a rebel sympathizer with ties to the left wing party of the house of delegates. At first, it seemed he was just a discontented radical, but we kept digging. Apparently, this man was poor, but his daughter recently got a full scholarship to a university in Rumburg. Out of nowhere. Honestly, Beatrice, you really need to get better agents, this was sloppy, even for you.” Romus heard another pause. “What else was I to do? My spies told me all about your little plan to have her exiled to a friendly country for a few years, only to have her back in Rizia so you could carry on that affair in secret. I did what I had to do to maintain my puppet in Rizia. Besides, your daughter would be a much better ruler than you.” Romus could feel his fist tighten as she continued. “But now that the secret’s out, I suppose there’s no going back. You are hereby kicked from GRACE effective immediately. You may consider all treaties with Rumburg null and void starting now.” Romus felt a pit in his stomach. He had a feeling this would happen. “Queen Beatrice, please listen to reason. You’re losing a valuable ally, on top of your alienating the rest of the world due to your warmongering. You’re actively making things worse for yourself.” Beatrice responded, even angrier than before. “No, *you* listen. I gave you a chance to make this right, but you failed. It has become clear that my alliance with you is no longer beneficial. Good luck defending your nation against Pales, Lespia, and Wehlen without us. I hope the communists cut off your head.” Romus ran his hand through his hair. His mind was going a mile a minute trying to figure out a way to fix this. “Is there anything I can do to make things right between us?” Queen Beatrice chuckled. “Oh, Romus, nothing you can do short of abdicating will fix this. You are a failure.” And she hung up without another word. 

Romus sat in the hospital room, still stunned by what happened. He was on the verge of the greatest decision of his life. He could either keep Lucita with him, exile her, or abdicate with her. Keeping her with him would be the easiest choice, but who knows what would happen to Rizia then? Abdicating would save Rizia’s relations with Rumburg, but Rizia might end up as little more than a puppet of it’s larger ally. Staying in power would keep his family together, and could secure Rizia’s independence, but who knows what might happen if Rizia were to be left alone in the world? And then there was the middleground: sending Lucita away like he planned. There might be a slim chance that relations with Rumburg could be salvaged without killing Lucita, but Romus found it unlikely. Romus shook his head in frustration and turned to look at his wife. “Looks like we’re back to where we were before: stuck between a rock and a hard place.” Lucita nodded. She had heard some of the phone call and got the gist of it. She sighed. “I wish there was a way for things to work out the way we wanted them to, but... that time has long since passed.” there was a pause. “So what are you going to do?” 

Suzerain is a game of choices. In the spirit of the game, I shall leave the outcome to the reader in the replies below. There are three potential endings, and none of them is the “true” one. All come with ups and downs. Ending 1 has Romus and Lucita staying in power together in defiance of Rumburg. Ending 2 has Romus compromising and sending Lucita away. Ending 3 has Romus and Lucita abdicating.

1ln5bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/romance/comments/1ln5bqe/the_one_that_got_away_pt2/,The One That Got Away (Pt.2),"After a while, things changed.

She started dating this guy named Jake. At first, I thought, ""Good for her."" She deserved someone who could give her what I couldn’t. But as the months went by, I noticed things weren’t as perfect as they seemed. Jake was… well, he was the kind of guy who took more than he gave. The little things she used to do—her smile, her laugh—started fading. She didn’t say much, but it was clear that being with Jake was taking its toll on her.

A year went by, and then it all came crashing down. They broke up. I could see how drained she was, the weight of it all on her shoulders. She had given so much to someone who didn’t appreciate her, the same way I had been in the past. And in a twist of fate, she ended up moving in with me, temporarily at first. We told ourselves it was just friends helping each other out, but it was more than that.

We spent more time together than we had in years. Late-night talks on the couch, sharing meals, watching shows together. It felt comfortable, like old times, but there was a new kind of tension. She wasn’t the same girl I knew before Jake—she was more vulnerable, more desperate for someone to see her, truly see her.

Then one night, she broke down.

We were sitting on the couch, talking about nothing in particular when she just started crying. She told me she was tired—tired of chasing people who didn’t value her, tired of giving and giving only to be left empty. And then she looked at me with those eyes, the same ones that used to be full of hope, and said, “Just give me a chance. Please. I’ll prove it to you. I’ll be everything you need. Just trust me.”

Her words hit me like a freight train. She was so raw, so desperate for something real, and there I was, still holding onto my fears. I had turned her down so many times, thinking I was protecting myself, but now… now she was the one who needed protecting. And it wasn’t just about her anymore. I realized I needed her, too. The emptiness inside me, the hopelessness I carried, started to crack.

So I said yes. I wasn’t fully committed, I wasn’t even sure if I could love her the way she wanted, but I couldn’t bear to see her hurting like that anymore. I told myself that maybe, just maybe, I could make this work.

At first, it felt like we were walking on thin ice. I wasn’t sure how to let her in, and she was still healing from Jake. But slowly, things started to change. She brought energy into my life that I hadn’t felt in years. It wasn’t just about being in a relationship—it was about having someone who truly cared about me, who wanted to see me happy.

She’d push me to do things I never thought I’d enjoy. Weekend hikes, spontaneous trips to the coast, even just getting me out of the house to grab coffee. I didn’t realize how much I had been living in my own bubble until she burst it open. She made me laugh, made me feel alive in ways I’d long forgotten. And slowly, she healed something in me that I didn’t even know was still broken.

I’ll admit, at first, I wasn’t all in. I was still guarded, still holding back. But she didn’t give up on me. She never gave up. And one day, I woke up and realized that I wasn’t the same person I had been before. The weight I’d carried from past relationships, from all the times I’d been used or hurt, it didn’t feel so heavy anymore. She had changed me, piece by piece, without me even realizing it.

I wasn’t hopeless anymore. I was… alive.

She was still the girl who had begged me to give her a chance, but now, she didn’t have to ask. I saw her for who she was, and I realized she had been right all along. She was the one person who had stuck by me when no one else had, who saw me even when I couldn’t see myself. And I loved her for that. It took time, but eventually, I gave her everything I had.

I wish I could say that everything was perfect from then on, that we rode off into the sunset without any more bumps in the road. But that’s not how life works. We still had our struggles, our moments of doubt. But the difference now was that I wasn’t alone in facing them. She was with me, every step of the way, and for the first time in my life, I believed I was worth that kind of love.

She had changed my life. From a hopeless, guarded person to someone who finally believed that love wasn’t something to be feared. It was something to be embraced. And all it took was the one person who never gave up on me, even when I had given up on myself.

1ln5be4,https://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/com/d/los-angeles-disabled-person-abducted/7860713001.html,Disabled person abducted prisoner 6 years,"Hi, in 2017 I moved to L.A.. I’m a disabled person on social security and all I could afford to live was in some type of shared living. I was at a coffee shop using the WiFi and looking for some where to stay and I didn’t think of it at the time due to not being from here that there was only one halfway house in all of L.A. that was in my pay range. So I call the ad and a guy named Henry assured me that it was a safe place state certified and everyone there was in recovery and even him himself was an ex pimp crack dealing identity theving bank robber band from the internet for life due to crime and now he was an outstanding concerned member of society and he somehow had 30years sobriety. And I took his word for it. Not because I’m nieve or stupid but because I’m trusting and believe the best of people. Anyway I had lost my id and the only way I could validate my identity and character was through my social media fb account and Henry was adamant that I show him that I was on the up and up exactly who I said I was. My phone was disconnected not working for some reason, it was a free government service and it wasn’t letting me login to my account I tried a few times and Henry told me that I could use his internet. So I tried to login to it like another 3 times and it just kept saying wrong password so Henry volunteered to put it in for me claiming he just had the magic touch and just like that it worked. But when he handed the phone back to me he had this cock sucking smile like he got away with something. I should have known rite then and there to run but I didn’t listen to my instincts and I had nowhere to go and no phone to call and I was from out of town and didn’t know anyone. So Henry said he was satisfied with who I was and that he had a bed available outside in the shed with dirt floors I could stay for the entire amount of my social security and I excepted. It was two days prior to my social security being paid before I could pay any rent and he was such a good guy that I could sleep on a couch on the front porch until it arrived. I sat out there with no water no food alone because for some reason I had to prove that I really wanted to stay there and be in recovery even being I didn’t do hardly anything ever. When I feel asleep I woke up covered in a swarm of mosquitoes and they had already tore me up so bad I was in pain and the only thing I could do was use a net that came from a tent to wrap myself up in to escape the misery. Will I made it through the two days of hell on the porch with no bathroom, my check came in and I was allowed to come inside at least to use the restroom but then back to the semi walled garage and I was greatfull and he had informed me about how the house was prime location and that the misfits recorded one of their albums right there and how him and the lead singer Glen Danzig where best friends and work out buddies and silly me just assumed that there must be some truth to it. I couldn’t imagine this ugly ass old bitch was what he is. Will get to that soon enough. For some reason it seems as if I was the only one living there that was required to go to a.a. Meetings and required to accompany Henry to them as well and I didn’t think it to strange that the rest of the guys staying at the house were ex pimps and in recovery that maby their work schedules didn’t leave enough room on the schedule to attend any meetings. I didn’t say anything when they were getting high and drunk I just minded my own business. Strange things started happening to me weird things I had never encountered before in all of my years experimenting with anything before like my phone started behaving odd not working correctly and every time I would walk out of the house to leave anywhere there were cars following me for some reason, they made it very obvious to see. I got blocked off of my social media account and email the password changed and I lost all of my contacts of friends and family members. People at the house started saying weird things to me and making passes at me people I never shared any of my interest or likes with and I remember that the last post I put up on Facebook read even the gangsters are gay here in L.A.. somehow it seems every other state already knew lol. I am openly bi but I generally keep my gay sex my business because purely that’s just my lonely late night desperation and only trying to prove that I’m still human every once in awhile just wish guys were prettier we are. Well one of the guys at the house kept quoting the matrix to me telling me that I was the one with no meaning and everyone was acting like I was crazy when I was calling the cops and reporting that there is someone that keeps shining a little red light in the window apparently a video camera and my stuff coming up missing and this guy in the house that smokes meth right out in the open in the room with no concern of being caught and talking about having sex with my deceased mother to me while he does it because I won’t be gay with him, but I’m the one who goes to jail after a guy comes over to the house with a machete informing me that I don’t know what is going on and that he and I had had sexual intercourse and Henry had hired him and filmed it all and I have never seen this guy thing before in my life. I don’t live like that I’ve never been filmed before never allowed anyone to watch never seen anybody doing it. I’ve never prostitutted or have ever been paid for having any kind of sexual intercourse in my life and very seldom do I put out. I’ve always have been very selfish with my body for no reason but it is mine. So I took the machete like the guy requested that I might need it. I didn’t understand what was going on and when Henry got back to the house I confronted him and asked and his response to me was that I needed to move out after just paying rent for the month and all the harassment I endured from the previous month I told him that I wasn’t going to leave till the following month when I got paid so him and his now long time standing crew started harassing me more. I would be getting ready to walk out of the house and go somewhere and then the next thing I knew it was like 4 or 5 hours later and I was still sitting in the same spot and I couldn’t figure out what happened or where the time went. Next Henry moved a programmer into the room across from mine and there were cameras all over the house wires down every hall and infrared camera alarms in every room. And every two minutes someone was outside tapping on the window or I’d leave and my stuff would be robbed. Now I have this situation I couldn’t notice at the time but in one instance I caught a guy named John in my room and stuff missing and since I knew it was him he put a knife to my throat and drug me out of the house saying he would kill me if I came back and they kept everything I owned and another instance where I got into a confrontation with the programmer he moved in and they put me in jail for vandalism. I had called the cops one time from the house phone because for some reason when I tried from my phone it never went through and I remember John telling Henry “ I thought he couldn’t call the cops anymore.” Henry said I thought he couldn’t. So somehow I have two occasions of being kicked out can anyone guess what happened and was going on? This is just the beginning of the horrors in store for me. I’ll start chapter two of the story soon and if anybody feels like they can guess, I’m curious to hear as my saga is still entombed to the misery.",2,1751169052.0,TargetedSolutions,1,1.0,False
1ln5bcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1ln5bcg/will_a_freezer_spell_help_halt_harmful_resistance/,Will a freezer spell help halt harmful resistance?,"I’ve been dealing with a few people whose refusal to take necessary action is directly impacting me financially and emotionally, and I’m feeling stuck and frustrated.

I tend to be pretty wary of what I see on social media, but this post I saw seemed like exactly what I needed. She wrote the person’s name on a piece of paper and on the back wrote “May any attention towards me or any resistance towards [insert boundary here] be transmuted into my abundance.” Then she folded it away from her as many times as possible, put it in a baggie, added pink salt and black salt for protection, clove to protect energy, mugwort to protect finances, rosemary to banish them, chili to make it sting a little, coffee to speed it up, and sugar to sweeten their energy towards abundance. Then tossed it all in the baggie with the paper and the water to put in the freezer. 

To be clear, I’m not trying to force anyone to do something against their will, I just want to stop the blockage and prevent further damage from their inaction. I also don’t want anyone to be harmed in the process. I’ve heard that freezer spells can be used to freeze harmful behavior or interference, and I’m wondering if it’s possible to target their resistance or avoidance instead the individuals themselves. 

Do you all think this is the right spell for what I need or is there a better option? If there is more than one person involved, do I need to do it multiple times or can I write more than one name down? How else could I reword the intention on the paper to make it more successful? Are there any other ethical considerations I should keep in mind?

Hey, so I have the biggest crush on one of the barista's at my local coffee stand, and I flirt with her a bunch (not in an obvious way but like super smiley and flustered kinda way,) and sometimes I feel like she flirts back, but I also know barista's flirt with customers in general 😅 I've been trying to feel it out to see if she feels the same and ask her if out for a month but I'm insanely dense and think too much. Anywho, I brought my roommate (who doesn't drive) with me today because she wanted coffee and offered to pay, since her girlfriend who is our other roomie was working; and I usually bring my cat😂 but in line, her coworker literally poked her head out the window and saw me and smiled, but then saw my roommate and her smile kinda faltered for a second. Then when I pulled up, I had to dive into my wallet to look for the stamp card and didn't get the chance to look at her, but when I looked up and over to see if she was working today, her coworker came up really quick and was pretty rude (usually super bubbly and nice to talk to,) and asked for my order which is unusual because the barista I have a crush on is usually the one who comes up to get my order (regular here,) and she just was quietly making the drinks behind her and wouldn't even look at me. Which honestly confused me because we talk all the time (about how my cats are doing, what I'm doing for the day, where I'm heading to, etc.) I kinda got the feeling she thought my roommate was my girlfriend since I usually just bring my cats when I'm traveling to my parents place, and so I really badly tried to hint and ask my roomate what time *her girlfriends name* was coming home (I kicked myself after realizing I should of asked ""when is your girlfriend coming home?"")
Then when we got home, my roommate (who knows about my crush,) told me she did come to the window at first all smiley, then looked into my window and saw her and her smile dropped and when my roommate smiled at her, she looked away. So the advice I'm honestly looking for is, because of this, I'm almost 99% sure feelings are mutual. How do I explain that my roommates just my friend without having to really say that? I feel really bad and I don't want her to think I was just playing with her😅 Also, because I'm almost certain she's into me too, how can I ask her out without making it too obvious or putting pressure on her?

• Tonight Dough
• Phish Food
• Oatmeal Dream Pie

Oatly Chocolate Ice cream
Their other flavors aren’t really good imo, the best runner up to the chocolate is the coffee flavor but it has been a few years so hopefully they have improved. 

Talenti dairy free sorbetto
• Raspberry (my favorite!)
• Mango
The raspberry one is sooo good. The mango isnt bad but im not big on mangoes. They have a strawberry flavor as well but I haven’t had the chance to try it. 

So Delicious 
Chocolate (made with coconut milk)
This was the first dairy free ice cream I tried and the only one available at the time. It was okay. Back then it was really icy and Im not too big on coconut flavor. I haven’t tried them since as they are very pricey in my area.

I usually comment or just read to feel less alone, but right now I’m really low. I am a 24 yr women recently diagnosis with CPTSD and chronic depression. I’ve been struggling with suicidal tendencies since I was a child. I always hated who I am and who I’m becoming, my personality feels like someone else’s mirror. I worshiped my narcissistic mother and bipolar Father for most of my life, making sure everything was just how she likes it so no trouble comes my way. I grew up fast, I had to with the environment I was in. Go to bars with them when I was 9, concerts with mosh pits and Pervy guys groping me at 12 years old. 
But 6 years ago I lost them, not to death or a freak accident but due to a college fund I was given. Long story short, I was supposed to split the check with her and she came at me aggressively, so I turned around and said “we can do this next time”, only just turned 19 at the time. I never saw them again after that. Their still v much alive, besides a meth/pill addiction, just refuse to connect with me.
 Ever since then I’ve been so focused on my psych degree and becoming something important that I forgot who I am. I mean mid-life crisis type of forgetting, I feel pointless and meaningless. I want a hug from my mother, to be told she’s proud of me, some kind of validation. I can’t find that feeling anywhere else, but I can’t forgive my mother/father for the stories I refuse to tell. So here I am, in this weird limbo, floating around with fluoxetine, bupropion, and mirtazapine. Barely eating, surviving on coffee and ouid, trying to love my fiancé and cat as much as I can. 
Yet I still feel the want to end things, just to feel the release of stress from my body sounds so nice. The tension gone from my shoulders and head just for a moment without breath. As much as I yearn for it, is as much as I’m scared of it. I’m scared of dying, I cry when I think about it: being found by my fiancé will break him, and never touching my cat Oliver seems to break me every time. 
I’m not sharing this for a cry for help, maybe I am, I really don’t know. I just hope some people understand what and how I’m feeling. This push and pull sensation that tires me endlessly.

Taking Estradiol, Progesterone and Spironolactone daily for gender affirming reasons. No major health issues besides a couple dermatological things.

So, for much of my life I was a bit on the heavy side around 200+ lbs. In the last year though ive lost a lost of weight, mostly by changing my diet and doing minor exercises at home more regularly. In the first six months I lost 29 lbs (down from 215 to 186) and then down another 7 these past few months. My sugar levels look way better, no longer prediabetic, and my cholesterol is totally normal, right in the middle.

Problem is, my triglycerides are SUPER high. I don't eat fatty foods, with the only fatty/greasy food i eat regularly being olive oil which I use for cooking. Other than that, I am a vegetarian and don't eat meat, mostly just plant proteins, a lot of other plants, mostly tomatoes, onion, garlic, herbs, spinach, zucchini, avocados, and peppers. I also eat a fair bit of carbs in the form whole-wheat pasta and corn tortillas. I avoid cheese so my main dairy intake is lactose-free light milk in my coffee/matcha.

Is it purely genetics? My parents both have high cholesterol, my dad's is probably because of diet, he's also diabetic. My mom is pretty healthy though, no diabetes, in good shape and exercises regularly. Hers is worse than his or mine. I don't know what else it could be.

I know I ought to talk to my doctor about it more, and trust me I'd like to, but my primary care provider is pretty awful and doesn't answer my MyChart messages. My insurance also will not cover something like a nutritionist. So try not to comment that because I know and it's not gonna help. Just lmk if anything I'm doing jumps out as a huge issue that might be covertly raising my levels, I'm really proud of my progress but the triglycerides have gotten WORSE since I've lost weight so I have no idea what to do.",3,1751168789.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

  IT WAS TWO weeks before Christmas. A slow time of year for raising the dead. My last client of the night sat across from me. There had been no notation by his name. No note saying zombie raising or vampire slaying. Nothing. Which probably meant whatever he wanted me to do was something I wouldn't, or couldn't, do. Pre-Christmas was a dead time of year, no pun intended. My boss, Bert, took any job that would have us.  
  
  George Smitz was a tall man, well over six feet. He was broad shouldered, and muscular. Not the muscles you get from lifting weights and running around indoor tracks. The muscles you get from hard physical labor. I would have bet money that Mr. Smitz was a construction worker, farmer, or something similar. He was shaped large and square with grime embedded under his fingernails that soap would not touch.  
  
  He sat in front of me, crushing his toboggan hat, kneading it in his big hands. The coffee that he'd accepted sat cooling on the edge of my desk. He hadn't taken so much as a sip.  
  
  I was drinking my coffee out of the Christmas mug that Bert, my boss, had insisted everyone bring in. A personalized holiday mug to add a personal touch to the office. My mug had a reindeer in a bathrobe and slippers with Christmas lights laced in its antlers, toasting the merry season with champagne and saying, ""Bingle Jells.""  
  
  Bert didn't really like my mug, but he let it go, probably afraid of what else I might bring in. He'd been very pleased with my outfit for the evening. A high-collared blouse so perfectly red I'd had to wear makeup to keep from looking pale. The skirt and matching jacket were a deep forest green. I hadn't dressed for Bert. I had dressed for my date.  
  
  The silver outline of an angel gleamed in my lapel. I looked very Christmasy. The Browning Hi-Power 9mm didn't look Christmasy at all, but since it was hidden under the jacket, that didn't seem to matter. It might have bothered Mr. Smitz, but he looked worried enough to not care. As long as I didn't shoot him personally.  
  
  ""Now, Mr. Smitz, how may I help you today?"" I asked.  
  
  He was staring at his hands and only his eyes rose to look at me. It was a little-boy gesture, an uncertain gesture. It sat oddly on the big man's face. ""I need help, and I don't know who else to go to.""  
  
  ""Exactly what kind of help do you need, Mr. Smitz?""  
  
  ""It's my wife.""  
  
  I waited for him to continue, but he stared at his hands. His hat was wadded into a tight ball.  
  
  ""You want your wife raised from the dead?"" I asked.  
  
  He looked up at that, eyes wide with alarm. ""She's not dead. I know that.""  
  
  ""Then what can I possibly do for you, Mr. Smitz? I raise the dead, and am a legal vampire executioner. What in that job description could help your wife?""  
  
  ""Mr. Vaughn said you knew all about lycanthropy."" He said that as if it explained everything. It didn't.  
  
  ""My boss makes a lot of claims, Mr. Smitz. But what does lycanthropy have to do with your wife?"" This was the second time I'd asked about his wife. I seemed to be speaking English, but perhaps my questions were really Swahili and I just didn't realize it. Or maybe whatever had happened was too awful for words. That happened a lot in my business.  
  
  He leaned forward, eyes intense on my face. I leaned forward, too, I couldn't help myself. ""Peggy, that's my wife, she's a lycanthrope.""  
  
  I blinked at him. ""And?""  
  
  ""If it came out, she'd lose her job.""  
  
  I didn't argue with him. Legally, you couldn't discriminate against lycanthropes, but it happened a lot. ""What sort of work is Peggy in?""  
  
  ""She's a butcher.""  
  
  A lycanthrope that was a butcher. It was too perfect. But I could see why she'd lose her job. Food preparation with a potentially fatal disease. I don't think so. I knew, and the health department knew, that lycanthropy can only be transferred by an attack in the animal form. Most people don't believe that. Can't say I blame them entirely. I don't want to be fuzzy, either.  
  
  ""She runs a specialty meat store. It's a good business. She inherited it from her father.""  
  
  ""Was he a lycanthrope, too?"" I asked.  
  
  He shook his head. ""No, Peggy was attacked a few years back. She survived..."" He shrugged. ""But, you know.""  
  
  I did know. ""So your wife is a lycanthrope and would lose her business if it came out. I understand that. But how can I help you?"" I fought the urge to glance at my watch. I had the tickets. Richard couldn't go in without me.  
  
  ""Peggy's missing.""  
  
  Ah. ""I am not a private detective, Mr. Smitz. I don't do missing persons.""  
  
  ""But I can't go to the police. They might find out.""  
  
  ""How long has she been missing?""  
  
  ""Two days.""  
  
  ""My advice is to go to the police.""  
  
  He shook his head stubbornly. ""No.""  
  
  I sighed. ""I don't know anything about finding a missing person. I raise the dead, slay vampires, that's it.""  
  
  ""Mr. Vaughn said you could help me.""  
  
  ""Did you tell him your problem?""  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  Shit. Bert and I were going to have a long talk. ""The police are good at their job, Mr. Smitz. Just tell them your wife is missing. Don't mention the lycanthropy. See what they turn up."" I didn't like telling a client to withhold information from the police, but it beat the heck out of not going at all.  
  
  ""Ms. Blake, please, I'm worried. We've got two kids.""  
  
  I started to say all the reasons I couldn't help him, then stopped. I had an idea. ""Animators, Inc., has a private investigator on retainer. Veronica Sims has been involved in a lot of preternatural cases. She might be able to help you.""  
  
  ""Can I trust her?""  
  
  ""I do.""  
  
  He stared at me for a long moment, then nodded. ""All right, how do I get in touch with her?""  
  
  ""Let me give her a call, see if she can see you.""  
  
  ""That would be great, thank you.""  
  
  ""I want to help you, Mr. Smitz. Hunting missing spouses just isn't my specialty."" I dialed the phone as I talked. I knew Ronnie's number by heart. We exercised at least twice a week together, not to mention an occasional movie, dinner, whatever. Best friends, a concept that most women never outgrow. Ask a man who his best friend is and he'll have to think about it. He won't know right off the top of his head. A woman would. A man might not even be able to think of a name, not for his best friend. Women keep track of these things. Men don't. Don't ask me why.  
  
  Ronnie's answering machine clicked in. ""Ronnie, if you're there, it's Anita, pick up.""  
  
  The phone clicked, and a second later I was talking to the genuine article. ""Hi, Anita. I thought you had a date with Richard tonight. Something wrong?""  
  
  See, best friends. ""Not with the  
date. I've got a client here who I think is more up your alley than mine.""  
  
  ""Tell me,"" she said.  
  
  I did.  
  
  ""Did you recommend he go to the police?""  
  
  ""Yep.""  
  
  ""He won't go?""  
  
  ""Nope.""  
  
  She sighed. ""Well, I've done missing persons before but usually after the police have done everything they can. They have resources I can't touch.""  
  
  ""I'm aware of that,"" I said.  
  
  ""He won't budge?""  
  
  ""I don't think so.""  
  
  ""So it's me or...""  
  
  ""Bert took the job knowing it was a missing person. He might try giving it to Jamison.""  
  
  ""Jamison doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground on anything but raising the dead.""  
  
  ""Yeah, but he's always eager to expand his repertoire.""  
  
  ""Ask him if he can be at my office..."" She paused while she leafed through her appointment book. Business must be good. ""At nine tomorrow morning.""  
  
  ""Jesus, you always were an early riser.""  
  
  ""One of my few faults,"" she said.  
  
  I asked George Smitz if nine o'clock tomorrow was all right.  
  
  ""Couldn't she see me tonight?""  
  
  ""He wants to see you tonight.""  
  
  She thought about that for a minute. ""Why not? It's not like I have a hot date, unlike some people I could mention. Sure, send him over. I'll wait. Friday with a client is better than Friday night alone, I guess.""  
  
  ""You've just hit a dry spell,"" I said.  
  
  ""And you've hit a wet spell.""  
  
  ""Very funny.""  
  
  She laughed. ""I'll look forward to Mr. Smitz's arrival. Enjoy Guys and Dolls.""  
  
  ""I will. See you tomorrow morning for our run.""  
  
  ""You sure you want me over there that early in case dream boat wants to stay over?""  
  
  ""You know me better than that,"" I said.  
  
  ""Yeah, I do. Just kidding. See you tomorrow.""  
  
  We hung up. I gave Mr. Smitz Ronnie's business card, directions to her office, and sent him on his way. Ronnie was the best I could do for him. It still bothered me that he wouldn't go to the police, but hey, it wasn't my wife.  
  
  I've got two kids, he'd said. Not my problem. Really. Craig, our nighttime secretary, was at the desk, which meant it was after six. I was running late. There really wasn't time to argue with Bert about Mr. Smitz, but...

 I glanced at Bert's office. It was dark. ""Boss man gone home?""  
  
  Craig glanced up from his computer keyboard. He has short, baby-fine brown hair. Round glasses to match a round face. He's slender and taller than I am, but then who isn't? He's in his twenties with a wife and two babies.  
  
  ""Mr. Vaughn left about thirty minutes ago.""  
  
  ""It figures,"" I said.  
  
  ""Something wrong?""  
  
  I shook my head. ""Schedule me some time to talk to the boss tomorrow.""  
  
  ""I don't know, Anita. He's booked pretty solid.""  
  
  ""Find some time, Craig. Or I'll barge in on one of the other appointments.""  
  
  ""You're mad,"" he said.  
  
  ""You bet. Find the time. If he yells about it, tell him I pulled a gun on you.""  
  
  ""Anita,"" he said with a grin, as if I were teasing.  
  
  I left him riffling through the appointment book trying to squeeze me somewhere. I meant it. Bert would talk to me tomorrow. December was our slowest season for raising zombies. People seemed to think you couldn't do it close to Christmas, as if it were black magic or something. So Bert scheduled other things to take up the slack. I was getting tired of clients with problems I could do nothing about. Smitz wasn't the first this month, but he was going to be the last.  
  
  With that cheerful thought I bundled into my coat and left. Richard was waiting. If traffic cooperated, I might just make it before the opening number. Traffic on a Friday night, surely not.  
  
  2  
  
  THE 1978 NOVA that I'd been driving had died a sad and tragic death. I was now driving a Jeep Cherokee Country. It was a deep, deep green that looked black at night. But it had four-wheel drive for winter and enough room to carry goats in the back. Chickens were what I used for zombie raising most of the time, but occasionally you needed something bigger. Carrying goats in the Nova had been a bitch.  
  
  I pulled the Cherokee into the last parking space in the lot on Grant. My long, black winter coat billowed around me because I had only buttoned the bottom two buttons. If I buttoned all the buttons I couldn't get to my gun.  
  
  My hands were shoved into the coat pockets, arms huddling the cloth around me. I didn't wear gloves. I've never been comfortable shooting with gloves on. The gun is a part of my hand. Cloth shouldn't interfere.  
  
  I ran across the street in my high-heeled pumps, careful on the frosty pavement. The sidewalk was cracked, with huge sections broken out of it, as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to it. The boarded-up buildings were as dilapidated as the sidewalk. I'd missed the crowd, being nearly late, so I had the shattered street to myself. It was a short but lonely walk on a December night. Broken glass littered the ground and in heels I had to be very careful where I stepped. An alley cut the buildings. It looked like the natural habitat of Muggerus americanus. I watched the darkness carefully. Nothing moved. With the Browning I wasn't too worried, but still...You didn't have to be a genius to shoot someone in the back.  
  
  The wind gusted cold enough to take my breath away as I neared the corner and relative safety. I wore a lot of sweaters in the winter, but tonight I'd wanted something dressier, and I was freezing my patooties off, but I was hoping that Richard would like the red blouse.  
  
  At the corner there were lights, cars, and a policeman directing traffic in the middle of the street. You never saw this many police in this section of St. Louis unless the Fox was on. A lot of wealthy people came down here in their furs, diamonds, Rolex watches. Wouldn't do for a friend of the city council to get mugged. When Topol came to reprise his role in Fiddler on the Roof, the audience was very creme de la creme and the place crawled with cops. Tonight there was just the usual. Mostly in front of the theater, mostly doing traffic, but also taking peeks at the seedy backs of buildings in case someone with money wandered away from the light.  
  
  I went through the glass doors into the long, narrow entryway. It was brightly lit, shiny somehow. There's a little room to the right where you can pick up your tickets. People streamed out of it, hurrying to the inner glass doors. I wasn't as late as I thought if there were this many people still getting tickets. Or maybe everyone else was as late as I was.  
  
  I caught a glimpse of Richard standing in the far right corner. At six foot one he is easier to spot across a crowded room than I am, at my own five foot three. He stood quietly, eyes following the crowd's movement. He didn't seem bored or impatient. He seemed to be having a good time watching the people. His eyes followed an elderly couple as they walked through the glass doors. The woman used a cane. Their progress was painfully slow. His head turned slowly with them. I scanned the crowd. Everyone else was younger, moving with confident or hurried stride. Was Richard looking for victims? Prey? He was, after all, a werewolf. He'd gotten a bad batch of lycanthropy vaccine. One of the reasons I never get the shots. If my flu shot accidentally backfires, that's one thing, but being furry once a month...No, thanks.  
  
  Did he realize he was standing there searching the crowd like a lion staring at a bunch of gazelles? Or maybe the elderly couple had reminded him of his grandparents. Hell, maybe I was giving him motives that were only in my suspicious little brain. I hoped so.  
  
  His hair was brown. In sunlight it gleamed with strands of gold, hints of copper. I knew the hair was shoulder length, nearly my length, but he'd done something to it, pulled it back somehow so it gave the illusion of being very short and close to his head. Not easy with hair as wavy as his.  
  
  His suit was some rich shade of green. Most men would have looked like Peter Pan in a green suit, but on him it looked just right. As I walked closer, I could see his shirt was a pale almost gold, tie a darker green than the suit, with tiny Christmas trees done in red. I would have made a smart remark about the tie, but dressed in red and green with a Christmas angel on my lapel, who was I to complain?  
  
  He saw me and smiled. The smile was very bright against his permanently tanned skin. His last name, Zeeman, is Dutch, but somewhere back in his ancestry was something not European. Not blond, not fair, not cold. His eyes were a perfect, chocolate brown.  
  
  He reached out and took my hands, gently, drawing me to him. His lips were soft against my mouth, a brief, nearly chaste kiss.  
  
  I stepped back, taking a breath. He kept hold of my hand, and I let him. His skin was very warm against my cold hand. I thought about asking him if he'd been thinking about eating that elderly couple, but didn't. Accusing him of murderous intent might spoil the evening. Besides, most lycanthropes weren't aware of doing nonhuman things. When you pointed it out, it always seemed to hurt their feelings. I didn't want to hurt Richard's feelings.  
  
  As we went through the inner doors into the crowded lobby, I asked, ""Where's your coat?""  
  
  ""In the car. Didn't want to carry it, so I made a dash for it.""  
  
  I nodded. It was typical Richard. Or maybe lycanthropes didn't get cold. From the back I could see he'd braided his hair tight to his scalp. The tip of the braid trailed over his collar. I couldn't even figure out how he'd done it. My idea of fixing my hair is to wash, smear a little hair goop through it, then let it dry. I was not into high-tech hair design. Though it might be fun to figure out the knots in a leisurely fashion after the show. I was always willing to learn a new skill.  
  
  The main lobby of the Fox is a cross between a really nice Chinese restaurant and a Hindu temple, with a little Art Deco thrown in for flavor. The colors are so dazzling, it looks like the painter ground up stained glass with bits of light trapped in them. Pit bull-size Chinese lions with glowing red eyes guard a sweep of stairs that lead up to the Fox Club balcony, where for fifteen thousand dollars a year you can eat wonderful meals and have a private box. The rest of us peons mingled nearly shoulder to shoulder in the carpeted lobby, with offerings of popcorn, pretzels, Pepsi, and on some nights, hot dogs. A far cry from chicken cordon bleu or whatever they were serving up above.  
  
  The Fox treads that wonderfully thin line between gaudiness and the fantastic. I've loved the building since I first saw it. Every time I come, there is some new wonder. Some color, or ca  
rving, or statue that I didn't notice before. When you realize that it was originally built to be a movie theater, you realize how much things have changed. Movie theaters now have the souls of unwashed socks. The Fox is alive as only the best buildings are alive.  
  
  I had to let go of Richard's hand to unbutton my coat the rest of the way, but hey, we weren't attached at the hip. I stood close to him in the crowd without touching, but I could feel him, like a line of warmth against my body.  
  
  ""We're going to look like the Bobsey twins when I take my coat off,"" I said.  
  
  He raised his eyebrows.  
  
  I spread the coat like a flasher, and he laughed. It was a good laugh, warm and thick like Christmas pudding.  
  
  ""'Tis the season,"" he said. He gave me a one-armed hug, quick like you'd give a friend, but his arm stayed over my shoulders. It was still early enough in our dating that touching each other was new, unexpected, exhilarating. We kept looking for excuses to touch each other. Trying to be nonchalant about it. Not fooling each other. Not sure we cared. I slipped my arm around his waist and leaned just a bit. It was my right arm. If we were attacked now, I'd never draw my gun in time. I stayed there for a minute thinking it just might be worth it. I moved around him, offering my left hand to him.  
  
  I don't know if he caught a glimpse of the gun or just figured it out, but his eyes widened. He leaned close to me, whispering against my hair. ""A gun here, at the Fox? You think the ushers will let you in?""  
  
  ""They did last time.""  
  
  He got a strange look on his face. ""You always go armed?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""After dark, yes.""  
  
  His eyes were puzzled, but he let it go. Before this year I'd sometimes gone out after dark unarmed but it had been a rough year. A lot of different people had tried to kill me. I was small even for a woman. I jogged, lifted weights, had a black belt in judo, but I was still outclassed by most professional bad guys. They tended to also lift weights, know martial arts, and outweigh me by a hundred pounds or more. I couldn't arm-wrestle them, but I could shoot them.  
  
  Also a lot of this year I'd been up against vampires, and other preternatural creepie-crawlies. They could lift large trucks with a single hand or worse. Silver bullets might not kill a vampire, but it certainly slowed them down. Enough for me to run like hell. To get away. To survive.  
  
  Richard knew what I did for a living. He'd even seen some of the messy parts. But I still expected him to blow it. To start playing the male protector and bitch about the gun or something. It was almost a permanent tightness in my gut, waiting for this man to say something awful. Something that would ruin it, destroy it, hurt.  
  
  So far, so good.  
  
  The crowd started flowing towards the stairs, parting on either side to the corridors leading into the main theater. We shuffle-stepped with the crowd, holding hands to keep from being separated. Sure.  
  
  Once free of the lobby, the crowd flowed towards the different aisles like water searching for the quickest route downstream. The quickest route was still pretty slow. I dug the tickets out of the pocket of my suit jacket. I didn't have a purse. There was a small brush, a lipstick, lipliner, eye shadow, ID, and my car keys stuffed in my coat pockets. My beeper was tucked in the front of my skirt, discreetly to one side. When not dressed up, I wore a fanny pack.  
  
  The usher, an older woman with glasses, shone a tiny flashlight on our tickets. She took us to our seats, motioned us in, and went back up to assist the next group of helpless people. The seats were good, near the middle, sort of close to the stage. Close enough.  
  
  Richard had scooted in to sit on my left without being asked. He's a quick study. It's one of the reasons we're still going out. That and the fact that I lust after his body something terrible.  
  
  I spread my coat over the seat, spreading it out so it wouldn't be bulky. His arm snaked across my chair, fingers touching my shoulder. I fought the urge to lay my head on his shoulder. Too hokey, then thought, what the hell. I snuggled into the bend of his neck, just breathing in the scent of his skin. His aftershave was clean and sweet, but underneath was the smell of his skin, his flesh. It made it so the aftershave would never smell the same on anyone else. Frankly, without a drop of aftershave I loved the smell of Richard's neck.  
  
  I straightened up, pulling just a little away from him. He looked at me questioningly. ""Something wrong?""  
  
  ""Nice aftershave,"" I said. No need to confess that I'd had an almost irresistible urge to nibble his neck. It was too embarrassing.  
  
  The lights dimmed and the music began. I'd never actually seen Guys and Dolls except in the movies. The one with Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons. Richard's idea of a date was caving, hiking, things that required your oldest clothes and a pair of good walking shoes. Nothing wrong with that. I like the outdoors, but I wanted to try a dress-up date. I wanted to see Richard in a suit and let him see me in something frillier than jeans. I was after all a girl, whether I liked to admit it or not.  
  
  But having proposed the date, I didn't want to do the usual dipsy-duo of dinner and a movie. So I'd called up the Fox to see what was playing and asked Richard if he liked musicals. He did. Another point in his favor. Since it was my idea, I bought the tickets. Richard had not argued, not even to pay half. After all, I hadn't offered to pay for our last dinner. It hadn't occurred to me. I was betting paying for the tickets occurred to Richard, but he'd let it go. Good man.  
  
  The curtain came up and the opening street scene paraded before us, bright colors, stylized, perfect and cheerful, and just what I needed. ""The Fugue for Tinhorns"" filled the bright stage and flowed out into the happy dark. Good music, humor, soon to be dancers, Richard's body next to mine, a gun under my arm. What more could a girl ask for?  
  
  3  
  
  A TRICKLE OF people had slipped out before the end of the musical, to beat the crowd. I always stayed until the very end. It seemed unfair to slink away before you could applaud. Besides, I hated missing the end of anything. I was always convinced that the bit I'd miss would be the best part.  
  
  We joined in enthusiastically with a standing ovation. I've never lived in any city that gives so many standing Os. Admittedly sometimes, like tonight, the show was wonderful, but I've seen people stand on productions that didn't deserve it. I don't stand unless I mean it.  
  
  Richard sat back down after the lights came up. ""I'd rather wait until the crowd thins out. If you don't mind."" There was a look in his brown eyes that said he didn't think I would.  
  
  I didn't. We'd driven separate cars. When we left the Fox, the evening was over. Apparently, neither of us wanted to leave. I knew I didn't.  
  
  I leaned on the seats in front of us, gazing down at him. He smiled up at me, eyes gleaming with lust, if not love. I was smiling, too. Couldn't seem to help myself.  
  
  ""You know this is a very sexist musical,"" he said.  
  
  I thought about that a moment, then nodded. ""Yep.""  
  
  ""But you like it?""  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  His eyes narrowed a bit. ""I thought you might be offended.""  
  
  ""I have better things to worry about than whether Guys and Dolls reflects a balanced worldview.""  
  
  He laughed--a short, happy sound. ""Good. For a minute there I thought I'd have to get rid of my Rodgers and Hammerstein collection.""  
  
  I studied his face, trying to decide if he was teasing me. I didn't think so. ""You really collect Rodgers and Hammerstein sound tracks?""  
  
  He nodded, eyes bright with laughter.  
  
  ""Just Rodgers and Hammerstein, or all musicals?""  
  
  ""I don't have them all, but all.""  
  
  I shook my head.  
  
  ""What's wrong?""  
  
  ""You're a romantic.""  
  
  ""You make it sound like a bad thing.""  
  
  ""That happy-ever-after shit is fine on stage, but it doesn't have a lot to do with life.""  
  
  It was his turn to study my face. Evidently, he didn't like what he saw, because he frowned. ""This date was your idea. If you don't approve of all this happy stuff, why'd you bring me?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""After I asked you on a dress-up date, I  
didn't know where to take you. I didn't want to do the usual. Besides, I like musicals. I just don't think they reflect reality.""  
  
  ""You're not as tough as you pretend to be.""  
  
  ""Yes,"" I said, ""I am.""  
  
  ""I don't believe that. I think you like that happy-ever-after shit as much as I do. You're just afraid to believe in it anymore.""  
  
  ""Not afraid, just cautious.""  
  
  ""Been disappointed too many times?"" He made it a question.  
  
  ""Maybe."" I crossed my arms on my stomach. A psychologist would have said I was closed off, uncommunicative. Fuck them.  
  
  ""What are you thinking?""  
  
  I shrugged.  
  
  ""Tell me, please.""  
  
  I stared into his sincere brown eyes and wanted to go home alone. Instead. ""Happy ever after is just a lie, Richard, and has been since I was eight.""  
  
  ""Your mother's death,"" he said.  
  
  I just looked at him. I was twenty-four years old and the pain of that first loss was still raw. You could deal with it, endure it, but never escape it. Never truly believe in the great, good place. Never truly believe that the bad thing wasn't going to come swooping down and take it all away. I'd rather fight a dozen vampires than one senseless accident.  
  
  He pried my hand from its grip on my arm. ""I won't die on you, Anita. I promise.""  
  
  Someone laughed, a low chuckle that brushed the skin like fingertips. Only one person had that nearly touchable laugh--Jean-Claude. I turned, and there he was, standing in the middle of the aisle. I hadn't heard him come. Hadn't sensed any movement. He was just there like magic.  
  
  ""Don't make promises you can't keep, Richard.""  
  
  4  
  
  I PUSHED AWAY from the seats, taking a step forward to give Richard room to stand. I felt him at my back, a comforting presence if I hadn't been more worried about his safety than my own.  
  
  Jean-Claude was dressed in a shiny black tux, complete with tails. A white vest with minute black dots bordered the gleaming whiteness of his shirt. The collar was high and stiff, with a cravat of soft black cloth tied around it and tucked into the vest as if ties had never been invented. The stickpin in his vest was made of silver-and-black onyx. His shoes had spats on them, like the ones Fred Astaire used to wear, though I suspected the entire outfit was of a much older style.

I've just hit gold for the first time and with that obviously comes unlimited lounge access. I've been silver for a few years, so 2 lounge entries with that, plus another 2 entries from my CC. With a limited number of entries, I've always used them sparingly, only when I find myself at the airport a few hours before my flight.

When flying out of Sydney, I always time it so I'm parking the car with an hr of my flight. By the time I bag drop/security/etc, I grab a coffee and head for the gate. No time to hang out in the lounge.

So that got me thinking. Do people get to the airport early on purpose to hang out in the lounge? Do you make it a habit to go to the lounge every time you fly? What do you do in there? Do you just grab some food/drink and leave or chill out for a bit?

  The New Year's Eve party at Merlotte's Bar and Grill was finally, finally, over. Though the bar owner, Sam Merlotte, had asked all his staff to work that night, Holly, Arlene, and I were the only ones who'd responded. Charlsie Tooten had said she was too old to put up with the mess we had to endure on New Year's Eve, Danielle had long-standing plans to attend a fancy party with her steady boyfriend, and a new woman couldn't start for two days. I guess Arlene and Holly and I needed the money more than we needed a good time.  
  
  And I hadn't had any invitations to do anything else. At least when I'm working at Merlotte's, I'm a part of the scenery. That's a kind of acceptance.  
  
  I was sweeping up the shredded paper, and I reminded myself again not to comment to Sam on what a poor idea the bags of confetti had been. We'd all made ourselves pretty clear about that, and even good-natured Sam was showing signs of wear and tear. It didn't seem fair to leave it all for Terry Bellefleur to clean, though sweeping and mopping the floors was his job.  
  
  Sam was counting the till money and bagging it up so he could go by the night deposit at the bank. He was looking tired but pleased.  
  
  He flicked open his cell phone. ""Kenya? You ready to take me to the bank? Okay, see you in a minute at the back door. "" Kenya, a police officer, often escorted Sam to the night deposit, especially after a big take like tonight's.  
  
  I was pleased with my money take, too. I had earned a lot in tips. I thought I might have gotten three hundred dollars or more - and I needed every penny. I would have enjoyed the prospect of totting up the money when I got home, if I'd been sure I had enough brains left to do it. The noise and chaos of the party, the constant runs to and from the bar and the serving hatch, the tremendous mess we'd had to clean up, the steady cacophony of all those brains. . . it had combined to exhaust me. Toward the end I'd been too tired to keep my poor mind protected, and lots of thoughts had leaked through.  
  
  It's not easy being telepathic. Most often, it's not fun.  
  
  This evening had been worse than most. Not only had the bar patrons, almost all known to me for many years, been in uninhibited moods, but there'd been some news that lots of people were just dying to tell me.  
  
  ""I hear yore boyfriend done gone to South America,"" a car salesman, Chuck Beecham, had said, malice gleaming in his eyes. ""You gonna get mighty lonely out to your place without him. ""  
  
  ""You offering to take his place, Chuck?"" the man beside him at the bar had asked, and they both had a we're-men-together guffaw.  
  
  ""Naw, Terrell,"" said the salesman. ""I don't care for vampire leavings. ""  
  
  ""You be polite, or you go out the door,"" I said steadily. I felt warmth at my back, and I knew my boss, Sam Merlotte, was looking at them over my shoulder.  
  
  ""Trouble?"" he asked.  
  
  ""They were just about to apologize,"" I said, looking Chuck and Terrell in the eyes. They looked down at their beers.  
  
  ""Sorry, Sookie,"" Chuck mumbled, and Terrell bobbed his head in agreement. I nodded and turned to take care of another order. But they'd succeeded in hurting me.  
  
  Which was their goal.  
  
  I had an ache around my heart.  
  
  I was sure the general populace of Bon Temps, Louisiana, didn't know about our estrangement. Bill sure wasn't in the habit of blabbing his personal business around, and neither was I. Arlene and Tara knew a little about it, of course, since you have to tell your best friends when you've broken up with your guy, even if you have to leave out all the interesting details. (Like the fact that you'd killed the woman he left you for. Which I couldn't help. Really. ) So anyone who told me Bill had gone out of the country, assuming I didn't know it yet, was just being malicious.  
  
  Until Bill's recent visit to my house, I'd last seen him when I'd given him the disks and computer he'd hidden with me. I'd driven up at dusk, so the machine wouldn't be sitting on his front porch for long. I'd put all his stuff up against the door in a big waterproofed box. He'd come out just as I was driving away, but I hadn't stopped.  
  
  An evil woman would have given the disks to Bill's boss, Eric. A lesser woman would have kept those disks and that computer, having rescinded Bill's (and Eric's) invitations to enter the house. I had told myself proudly that I was not an evil, or a lesser, woman.  
  
  Also, thinking practically, Bill could just have hired some human to break into my house and take them. I didn't think he would. But he needed them bad, or he'd be in trouble with his boss's boss. I've got a temper, maybe even a bad temper, once it gets provoked. But I'm not vindictive.  
  
  Arlene has often told me I am too nice for my own good, though I assure her I am not. (Tara never says that; maybe she knows me better?) I realized glumly that, sometime during this hectic evening, Arlene would hear about Bill's departure. Sure enough, within twenty minutes of Chuck and Terrell's gibing, she made her way through the crowd to pat me on the back. ""You didn't need that cold bastard anyway,"" she said. ""What did he ever do for you?""  
  
  I nodded weakly at her to show how much I appreciated her support. But then a table called for two whiskey sours, two beers, and a gin and tonic, and I had to hustle, which was actually a welcome distraction. When I dropped off their drinks, I asked myself the same question. What had Bill done for me?  
  
  I delivered pitchers of beer to two tables before I could add it all up.  
  
  He'd introduced me to sex, which I really enjoyed. Introduced me to a lot of other vampires, which I didn't. Saved my life, though when you thought about it, it wouldn't have been in danger if I hadn't been dating him in the first place. But I'd saved his back once or twice, so that debt was canceled. He'd called me ""sweetheart,"" and at the time he'd meant it.  
  
  ""Nothing,"" I muttered, as I mopped up a spilled pina colada and handed one of our last clean bar towels to the woman who'd knocked it over, since a lot of it was still in her skirt. ""He didn't do a thing for me. "" She smiled and nodded, obviously thinking I was commiserating with her. The place was too noisy to hear anything anyway, which was lucky for me.  
  
  But I'd be glad when Bill got back. After all, he was my nearest neighbor. The community's older cemetery separated our properties, which lay along a parish road south of Bon Temps. I was out there all by myself, without Bill.  
  
  ""Peru, I hear,"" my brother Jason, said. He had his arm around his girl of the evening, a short, thin, dark twenty-one-year-old from somewhere way out in the sticks. (I'd carded her. ) I gave her a close look. Jason didn't know it, but she was a shape-shifter of some kind. They're easy to spot. She was an attractive girl, but she changed into something with feathers or fur when the moon was full. I noticed Sam give her a hard glare when Jason's back was turned, to remind her to behave herself in his territory. She returned the glare, with interest. I had the feeling she didn't become a kitten, or a squirrel.  
  
  I thought of latching on to her brain and trying to read it, but shifter heads aren't easy. Shifter thoughts are kind of snarly and red, though every now and then you can get a good picture of emotions. Same with Weres.  
  
  Sam himself turns into a collie when the moon is bright and round. Sometimes he trots all the way over to my house, and I feed him a bowl of scraps and let him nap on my back porch, if the weather's good, or in my living room, if the weather's poor. I don't let him in the bedroom anymore, because he wakes up naked - in which state he looks very nice, but I just don't need to be tempted by my boss.  
  
  The moon wasn't full tonight, so Jason would be safe. I decided not to say anything to him about his date. Everyone's got a secret or two. Her secret was just a little more colorful.  
  
  Besides my brother's date, and Sam of course, there were two other supernatural creatures in Merlotte's Bar that New Year's Eve. One was a magnificent woman at least six feet tall, with long rippling dark hair. Dressed to kill in a skintight long-sleeved orange dress, she'd come in by herself, and she was in the process of meeting every guy in the bar. I didn't know what she was, but  
I knew from her brain pattern that she was not human. The other creature was a vampire, who'd come in with a group of young people, most in their early twenties. I didn't know any of them. Only a sideways glance by a few other revelers marked the presence of a vampire. It just went to show the change in attitude in the few years since the Great Revelation.  
  
  Almost three years ago, on the night of the Great Revelation, the vampires had gone on TV in every nation to announce their existence. It had been a night in which many of the world's assumptions had been knocked sideways and rearranged for good.  
  
  This coming-out party had been prompted by the Japanese development of a synthetic blood that can keep vamps satisfied nutritionally. Since the Great Revelation, the United States has undergone numerous political and social upheavals in the bumpy process of accommodating our newest citizens, who just happen to be dead. The vampires have a public face and a public explanation for their condition - they claim an allergy to sunlight and garlic causes severe metabolic changes - but I've seen the other side of the vampire world. My eyes now see a lot of things most human beings don't ever see. Ask me if this knowledge has made me happy.  
  
  No.  
  
  But I have to admit, the world is a more interesting place to me now. I'm by myself a lot (since I'm not exactly Norma Normal), so the extra food for thought has been welcome. The fear and danger haven't. I've seen the private face of vampires, and I've learned about Weres and shifters and other stuff. Weres and shifters prefer to stay in the shadows - for now - while they watch how going public works out for the vamps.  
  
  See, I had all this to mull over while collecting tray after tray of glasses and mugs, and unloading and loading the dishwasher to help Tack, the new cook. (His real name is Alphonse Petacki. Can you be surprised he likes ""Tack"" better?) When our part of the cleanup was just about finished, and this long evening was finally over, I hugged Arlene and wished her a happy New Year, and she hugged me back. Holly's boyfriend was waiting for her at the employees' entrance at the back of the building, and Holly waved to us as she pulled on her coat and hurried out.  
  
  ""What're your hopes for the New Year, ladies?"" Sam asked. By that time, Kenya was leaning against the bar, waiting for him, her face calm and alert. Kenya ate lunch here pretty regularly with her partner, Kevin, who was as pale and thin as she was dark and rounded. Sam was putting the chairs up on the tables so Terry Bellefleur, who came in very early in the morning, could mop the floor.  
  
  ""Good health, and the right man,"" Arlene said dramatically, her hands fluttering over her heart, and we laughed. Arlene has found many men - and she's been married four times - but she's still looking for Mr. Right. I could ""hear"" Arlene thinking that Tack might be the one. I was startled; , I hadn't even known she'd looked at him.  
  
  The surprise showed on my face, and in an uncertain voice Arlene said, ""You think I should give up?""  
  
  ""Hell, no,"" I said promptly, chiding myself for not guarding my expression better. It was just that I was so tired. ""It'll be this year, for sure, Arlene. "" I smiled at Bon Temp's only black female police officer. ""You have to have a wish for the New Year, Kenya. Or a resolution. ""  
  
  ""I always wish for peace between men and women,"" Kenya said. ""Make my job a lot easier. And my resolution is to bench-press one-forty. ""  
  
  ""Wow,"" said Arlene. Her dyed red hair contrasted violently with Sam's natural curly red-gold as she gave him a quick hug. He wasn't much taller than Arlene - though she's at least five foot eight, two inches taller than I. ""I'm going to lose ten pounds, that's my resolution. "" We all laughed. That had been Arlene's resolution for the past four years. ""What about you, Sam? Wishes and resolutions?"" she asked.  
  
  ""I have everything I need,"" he said, and I felt the blue wave of sincerity coming from him. ""I resolve to stay on this course. The bar is doing great, I like living in my double-wide, and the people here are as good as people anywhere. ""  
  
  I turned to conceal my smile. That had been a pretty ambiguous statement. The people of Bon Temps were, indeed, as good as people anywhere.  
  
  ""And you, Sookie?"" he asked. Arlene, Kenya, and Sam were all looking at me. I hugged Arlene again, because I like to. I'm ten years younger - maybe more, since though Arlene says she's thirty-six, I have my doubts - but we've been friends ever since we started working at Merlotte's together after Sam bought the bar, maybe five years now.  
  
  ""Come on,"" Arlene said, coaxing me. Sam put his arm around me. Kenya smiled, but drifted away into the kitchen to have a few words with Tack.  
  
  Acting on impulse, I shared my wish. ""I just hope to not be beaten up,"" I said, my weariness and the hour combining in an ill-timed burst of honesty. ""I don't want to go to the hospital. I don't want to see a doctor. "" I didn't want to have to ingest any vampire blood, either, which would cure you in a hurry but had various side effects. ""So my resolution is to stay out of trouble,"" I said firmly.  
  
  Arlene looked pretty startled, and Sam looked - well, I couldn't tell about Sam. But since I'd hugged Arlene, I gave him a big hug, too, and felt the strength and warmth in his body. You think Sam's slight until you see him shirtless unloading boxes of supplies. He is really strong and built really smooth, and he has a high natural body temperature. I felt him kiss my hair, and then we were all saying good night to each other and walking out the back door. Sam's truck was parked in front of his trailer, which is set up behind Merlotte's Bar but at a right angle to it, but he climbed in Kenya's patrol car to ride to the bank. She'd bring him home, and then Sam could collapse. He'd been on his feet for hours, as had we all.  
  
  As Arlene and I unlocked our cars, I noticed Tack was waiting in his old pickup; I was willing to bet he was going to follow Arlene home.  
  
  With a last ""Good night!"" called through the chilly silence of the Louisiana night, we separated to begin our new years.  
  
  I turned off onto Hummingbird Road to go out to my place, which is about three miles southeast of the bar. The relief of finally being alone was immense, and I began to relax mentally. My headlights flashed past the close-packed trunks of the pines that formed the backbone of the lumber industry hereabouts.  
  
  The night was extremely dark and cold. There are no streetlights way out on the parish roads, of course. Creatures were not stirring, not by any means. Though I kept telling myself to be alert for deer crossing the road, I was driving on autopilot. My simple thoughts were filled with the plan of scrubbing my face and pulling on my warmest nightgown and climbing into my bed.  
  
  Something white appeared in the headlights of my old car.  
  
  I gasped, jolted out of my drowsy anticipation of warmth and silence.  
  
  A running man: At three in the morning on January first, he was running down the parish road, apparently running for his life.  
  
  I slowed down, trying to figure out a course of action. I was a lone unarmed woman. If something awful was pursuing him, it might get me, too. On the other hand, I couldn't let someone suffer if I could help. I had a moment to notice that the man was tall, blond, and clad only in blue jeans, before I pulled up by him. I put the car into park and leaned over to roll down the window on the passenger's side.  
  
  ""Can I help you?"" I called. He gave me a panicked glance and kept on running.  
  
  But in that moment I realized who he was. I leaped out of the car and took off after him.  
  
  ""Eric!"" I yelled. ""It's me!""  
  
  He wheeled around then, hissing, his fangs fully out. I stopped so abruptly I swayed where I stood, my hands out in front of me in a gesture of peace. Of course, if Eric decided to attack, I was a dead woman. So much for being a good Samaritan.  
  
  Why didn't Eric recognize me? I'd known him for many months. He was Bill's boss, in the complicated vampire hierarchy that I was beginning to learn. Eric was the sheriff of Area Five, and he was a vampire on the rise. He was also gorgeous and could kiss like a house afire, but that was not the most pertinent side of him right at the moment. Fangs and strong hands curve  
d into claws were what I was seeing. Eric was in full alarm mode, but he seemed just as scared of me as I was of him. He didn't leap to attack.  
  
  ""Stay back, woman,"" he warned me. His voice sounded like his throat was sore, raspy and raw.  
  
  ""What are you doing out here?""  
  
  ""Who are you?""  
  
  ""You known darn good and well who I am. What's up with you? Why are you out here without your car?"" Eric drove a sleek Corvette, which was simply Eric.  
  
  ""You know me? Who am I?""  
  
  Well, that knocked me for a loop. He sure didn't sound like he was joking. I said cautiously, ""Of course I know you, Eric. Unless you have an identical twin. You don't, right?""  
  
  ""I don't know. "" His arms dropped, his fangs seemed to be retracting, and he straightened from his crouch, so I felt there'd been a definite improvement in the atmosphere of our encounter.  
  
  ""You don't know if you have a brother?"" I was pretty much at sea.  
  
  ""No. I don't know. Eric is my name?"" In the glare of my headlights, he looked just plain pitiful.  
  
  ""Wow. "" I couldn't think of anything more helpful to say. ""Eric Northman is the name you go by these days. Why are you out here?""  
  
  ""I don't know that, either. ""  
  
  I was sensing a theme here. ""For real? You don't remember anything?"" I tried to get past being sure that at any second he'd grin down at me and explain everything and laugh, embroiling me in some trouble that would end in me. . . getting beaten up.  
  
  ""For real. "" He took a step closer, and his bare white chest made me shiver with sympathetic goose bumps. I also realized (now that I wasn't terrified) how forlorn he looked. It was an expression I'd never seen on the confident Eric's face before, and it made me feel unaccountably sad.  
  
  ""You know you're a vampire, right?""  
  
  ""Yes. "" He seemed surprised that I asked. ""And you are not. ""  
  
  ""No, I'm real human, and I have to know you won't hurt me. Though you could have by now. But believe me, even if you don't remember it, we're sort of friends. ""  
  
  ""I won't hurt you. ""  
  
  I reminded myself that probably hundreds and thousands of people had heard those very words before Eric ripped their throats out. But the fact is, vampires don't have to kill once they're past their first year. A sip here, a sip there, that's the norm. When he looked so lost, it was hard to remember he could dismember me with his bare hands.  
  
  I'd told Bill one time that the smart thing for aliens to do (when they invaded Earth) would be to arrive in the guise of lop-eared bunnies.  
  
  ""Come get in my car before you freeze,"" I said. I was having that I'm-getting-sucked-in feeling again, but I didn't know what else to do.  
  
  ""I do know you?"" he said, as though he were hesitant about getting in a car with someone as formidable as a woman ten inches shorter, many pounds lighter, and a few centuries younger.  
  
  ""Yes,"" I said, not able to restrain an edge of impatience. I wasn't too happy with myself, because I still half suspected I was being tricked for some unfathomable reason. ""Now come on, Eric. I'm freezing, and so are you. "" Not that vampires seemed to feel temperature extremes, as a rule; but even Eric's skin looked goosey. The dead can freeze, of course. They'll survive it - they survive almost everything - but I understand it's pretty painful. ""Oh my God, Eric, you're barefoot. "" I'd just noticed.  
  
  I took his hand; he let me get close enough for that. He let me lead him back to the car and stow him in the passenger seat. I told him to roll up the window as I went around to my side, and after a long minute of studying the mechanism, he did.  
  
  I reached in the backseat for an old afghan I keep there in the winter (for football games, etc. ) and wrapped it around him. He wasn't shivering, of course, because he was a vampire, but I just couldn't stand to look at all that bare flesh in this temperature. I turned the heater on full blast (which, in my old car, isn't saying much).  
  
  Eric's exposed skin had never made me feel cold before - when I'd seen this much of Eric before, I'd felt anything but. I was giddy enough by now to laugh out loud before I could censor my own thoughts.  
  
  He was startled, and looked at me sideways.  
  
  ""You're the last person I expected to see,"" I said. ""Were you coming out this way to see Bill? Because he's gone. ""  
  
  ""Bill?""  
  
  ""The vampire who lives out here? My ex-boyfriend?""  
  
  He shook his head. He was back to being absolutely terrified.  
  
  ""You don't know how you came to be here?""  
  
  He shook his head again.  
  
  I was making a big effort to think hard; but it was just that, an effort. I was worn out. Though I'd had a rush of adrenaline when I'd spotted the figure running down the dark road, that rush was wearing off fast. I reached the turnoff to my house and turned left, winding through the black and silent woods on my nice, level driveway - that, in fact, Eric had had re-graveled for me.  
  
  And that was why Eric was sitting in my car right now, instead of running through the night like a giant white rabbit. He'd had the intelligence to give me what I really wanted. (Of course, he'd also wanted me to go to bed with him for months. But he'd given me the driveway because I needed it. )  
  
  ""Here we are,"" I said, pulling around to the back of my old house. I switched off the car. I'd remembered to leave the outside lights on when I'd left for work that afternoon, thank goodness, so we weren't sitting there in total darkness.  
  
  ""This is where you live?"" He was glancing around the clearing where the old house stood, seemingly nervous about going from the car to the back door.  
  
  ""Yes,"" I said, exasperated.  
  
  He just gave me a look that showed white all around the blue of his eyes.  
  
  ""Oh, come on,"" I said, with no grace at all. I got out of the car and went up the steps to the back porch, which I don't keep locked because, hey, why lock a screened-in back porch? I do lock the inner door, and after a second's fumbling, I had it open so the light I leave on in the kitchen could spill out. ""You can come in,"" I said, so he could cross the threshold. He scuttled in after me, the afghan still clutched around him.  
  
  Under the overhead light in the kitchen, Eric looked pretty pitiful. His bare feet were bleeding, which I hadn't noticed before. ""Oh, Eric,"" I said sadly, and got a pan out from the cabinet, and started the hot water to running in the sink. He'd heal real quick, like vampires do, but I couldn't help but wash him clean. The blue jeans were filthy around the hem. ""Pull 'em off,"" I said, knowing they'd just get wet if I soaked his feet while he was dressed.  
  
  With not a hint of a leer or any other indication that he was enjoying this development, Eric shimmied out of the jeans. I tossed them onto the back porch to wash in the morning, trying not to gape at my guest, who was now clad in underwear that was definitely over-the-top, a bright red bikini style whose stretchy quality was definitely being tested. Okay, another big surprise. I'd seen Eric's underwear only once before - which was once more than I ought to have - and he'd been a silk boxers guy. Did men change styles like that?  
  
  Without preening, and without comment, the vampire rewrapped his white body in the afghan. Hmmm. I was now convinced he wasn't himself, as no other evidence could have convinced me. Eric was way over six feet of pure magnificence (if a marble white magnificence), and he well knew it.  
  
  I pointed to one of the straight-back chairs at the kitchen table. Obediently, he pulled it out and sat. I crouched to put the pan on the floor, and I gently guided his big feet into the water. Eric groaned as the warmth touched his skin. I guess that even a vampire could feel the contrast. I got a clean rag from under the sink and some liquid soap, and I washed his feet. I took my time, because I was trying to think what to do next,  
  
  ""You were out in the night,"" he observed, in a tentative sort of way.  
  
  ""I was coming home from work, as you can see from my clothes. "" I was wearing our winter uniform, a long-sleeved white boat-neck T-shirt with ""Merlotte's Bar"" embroidere  
d over the left breast and worn tucked into black slacks.  
  
  ""Women shouldn't be out alone this late at night,"" he said disapprovingly.  
  
  ""Tell me about it. ""  
  
  ""Well, women are more liable to be overwhelmed by an attack than men, so they should be more protected - ""  
  
  ""No, I didn't mean literally. I meant, I agree. You're preaching to the choir. I didn't want to be working this late at night. ""  
  
  ""Then why were you out?""  
  
  ""I need the money,"" I said, wiping my hand and pulling the roll of bills out of my pocket and dropping it on the table while I was thinking about it. ""I got this house to maintain, my car is old, and I have taxes and insurance to pay. Like everyone else,"" I added, in case he thought I was complaining unduly. I hated to poor-mouth, but he'd asked.  
  
  ""Is there no man in your family?""  
  
  Every now and then, their ages do show. ""I have a brother. I can't remember if you've ever met Jason. "" A cut on his left foot looked especially bad. I put some more hot water into the basin to warm the remainder. Then I tried to get all the dirt out. He winced as I gently rubbed the washcloth over the margins of the wound. The smaller cuts and bruises seemed to be fading even as I watched. The hot water heater came on behind me, the familiar sound somehow reassuring.  
  
  ""Your brother permits you to do this working?""  
  
  I tried to imagine Jason's face when I told him that I expected him to support me for the rest of my life because I was a woman and shouldn't work outside the home. ""Oh, for goodness sake, Eric. "" I looked up at him, scowling. ""Jason's got his own problems. "" Like being chronically selfish and a true tomcat.  
  
  I eased the pan of water to the side and patted Eric dry with a dishtowel. This vampire now had clean feet. Rather stiffly, I stood. My back hurt. My feet hurt. ""Listen, I think what I better do is call Pam. She'll probably know what's going on with you. ""  
  
  ""Pam?""  
  
  It was like being around a particularly irritating two-year-old.  
  
  ""Your second-in-command. ""  
  
  He was going to ask another question, I could just tell. I held up a hand. ""Just hold on. Let me call her and find out what's happening. ""  
  
  ""But what if she has turned against me?""  
  
  ""Then we need to know that, too. The sooner the better. ""  
  
  I put my hand on the old phone that hung on the kitchen wall right by the end of the counter. A high stool sat below it. My grandmother had always sat on the stool to conduct her lengthy phone conversations, with a pad and pencil handy. I missed her every day. But at the moment I had no room in my emotional palette for grief, or even nostalgia. I looked in my little address book for the number of Fangtasia, the vampire bar in Shreveport that provided Eric's principal income and served as the base of his operations, which I understood were far wider in scope. I didn't know how wide or what these other moneymaking projects were, and I didn't especially want to know.  
  
  I'd seen in the Shreveport paper that Fangtasia, too, had planned a big bash for the evening - ""Begin Your New Year with a Bite"" - so I knew someone would be there. While the phone was ringing, I swung open the refrigerator and got out a bottle of blood for Eric. I popped it in the microwave and set the timer. He followed my every move with anxious eyes.  
  
  ""Fangtasia,"" said an accented male voice.  
  
  ""Chow?""  
  
  ""Yes, how may I serve you?"" He'd remembered his phone persona of sexy vampire just in the nick of time.  
  
  ""It's Sookie. ""  
  
  ""Oh,"" he said in a much more natural voice. ""Listen, Happy New Year, Sook, but we're kind of busy here. ""  
  
  ""Looking for someone?""  
  
  There was a long, charged silence.  
  
  ""Wait a minute,"" he said, and then I heard nothing.  
  
  ""Pam,"" said Pam. She'd picked up the receiver so silently that I jumped when I heard her voice.  
  
  ""Do you still have a master?"" I didn't know how much I could say over the phone. I wanted to know if she'd been the one who'd put Eric in this state, or if she still owed him loyalty.  
  
  ""I do,"" she said steadily, understanding what I wanted to know. ""We are under. . . we have some problems. ""  
  
  I mulled that over until I was sure I'd read between the lines. Pam was telling me that she still owed Eric her allegiance, and that Eric's group of followers was under some kind of attack or in some kind of crisis.  
  
  I said, ""He's here. "" Pam appreciated brevity.  
  
  ""Is he alive?""  
  
  ""Yep. ""  
  
  ""Damaged?""  
  
  ""Mentally. ""  
  
  A long pause, this time.  
  
  ""Will he be a danger to you?""  
  
  Not that Pam cared a whole hell of a lot if Eric decided to drain me dry, but I guess she wondered if I would shelter Eric. ""I don't think so at the moment,"" I said. ""It seems to be a matter of memory. ""  
  
  ""I hate witches. Humans had the right idea, burning them at the stake. ""  
  
  Since the very humans who had burned witches would have been delighted to sink that same stake into vampire hearts, I found that a little amusing - but not very, considering the hour. I immediately forgot what she'd been talking about. I yawned.  
  
  ""Tomorrow night, we'll come,"" she said finally. ""Can you keep him this day? Dawn's in less than four hours. Do you have a safe place?""  
  
  ""Yes. But you get over here at nightfall, you hear me? I don't want to get tangled up in your vampire shit again. "" Normally, I don't speak so bluntly; but like I say, it was the tail end of a long night.  
  
  ""We'll be there. ""  
  
  We hung up simultaneously. Eric was watching me with unblinking blue eyes. His hair was a snarly tangled mess of blond waves. His hair is the exact same color as mine, and I have blue eyes, too, but that's the end of the similarities.  
  
  I thought of taking a brush to his hair, but I was just too weary.  
  
  ""Okay, here's the deal,"" I told him. ""You stay here the rest of the night and tomorrow, and then Pam and them'll come get you tomorrow night and let you know what's happening. ""  
  
  ""You won't let anyone get in?"" he asked. I noticed he'd finished the blood, and he wasn't quite as drawn as he'd been, which was a relief.  
  
  ""Eric, I'll do my best to keep you safe,"" I said, quite gently. I rubbed my face with my hands. I was going to fall asleep on my feet. ""Come on,"" I said, taking his hand. Clutching the afghan with the other hand, he trailed down the hall after me, a snow white giant in tiny red underwear.  
  
  My old house has been added onto over the years, but it hasn't ever been more than a humble farmhouse. A second story was added around the turn of the century, and two more bedrooms and a walk-in attic are upstairs, but I seldom go up there anymore. I keep it shut off, to save money on electricity. There are two bedrooms downstairs, the smaller one I'd used until my grandmother died and her large one across the hall from it. I'd moved into the large one after her death. But the hidey-hole Bill had built was in the smaller bedroom. I led Eric in there, switched on the light, and made sure the blinds were closed and the curtains drawn across them. Then I opened the door of the closet, removed its few contents, and pulled back the flap of carpet that covered the closet floor, exposing the trapdoor. Underneath was a light-tight space that Bill had built a few months before, so that he could stay over during the day or use it as a hiding place if his own home was unsafe. Bill liked having a bolt-hole, and I was sure he had some that I didn't know about. If I'd been a vampire (God forbid), I would have, myself.  
  
  I had to wipe thoughts of Bill out of my head as I showed my reluctant guest how to close the trapdoor on top of him and that the flap of carpet would fall back into place. ""When I get up, I'll put the stuff back in the closet so it'll look natural,"" I reassured him, and smiled encouragingly.  
  
  ""Do I have to get in now?"" he asked.  
  
  Eric, making a request of me: The world was really turned upside-down. ""No,"" I said, trying to sound like I was concerned. All I could think of was my bed. ""You don't have to.  
Just get in before sunrise. There's no way you could miss that, right? I mean, you couldn't fall asleep and wake up in the sun?""  
  
  He thought for a moment and shook his head. ""No,"" he said. ""I know that can't happen. Can I stay in the room with you?""  
  
  Oh, God, puppy dog eyes. From a six-foot-five ancient Viking vampire. It was just too much. I didn't have enough energy to laugh, so I just gave a sad little snigger. ""Come on,"" I said, my voice as limp as my legs. I turned off the light in that room, crossed the hall, and flipped on the one in my own room, yellow and white and clean and warm, and folded down the bedspread and blanket and sheet. While Eric sat forlornly in a slipper chair on the other side of the bed, I pulled off my shoes and socks, got a nightgown out of a drawer, and retreated into the bathroom. I was out in ten minutes, with clean teeth and face and swathed in a very old, very soft flannel nightgown that was cream-colored with blue flowers scattered around. Its ribbons were raveled and the ruffle around the bottom was pretty sad, but it suited me just fine. After I'd switched off the lights, I remembered my hair was still up in its usual ponytail, so I pulled out the band that held it and I shook my head to make it fall loose. Even my scalp seemed to relax, and I sighed with bliss.  
  
  As I climbed up into the high old bed, the large fly in my personal ointment did the same. Had I actually told him he could get in bed with me? Well, I decided, as I wriggled down under the soft old sheets and the blanket and the comforter, if Eric had designs on me, I was just too tired to care.  
  
  ""Woman?""  
  
  ""Hmmm?""  
  
  ""What's your name?""  
  
  ""Sookie. Sookie Stackhouse. ""  
  
  ""Thank you, Sookie. ""  
  
  ""Welcome, Eric. ""  
  
  Because he sounded so lost - the Eric I knew had never been one to do anything other than assume others should serve him - I patted around under the covers for his hand. When I found it, I slid my own over it. His palm was turned up to meet my palm, and his fingers clasped mine.  
  
  And though I would not have thought it was possible to go to sleep holding hands with a vampire, that's exactly what I did.

Chapter 2  
  
  2  
  
  I woke up slowly. As I lay snuggled under the covers, now and then stretching an arm or a leg, I gradually remembered the surrealistic happenings of the night before.  
  
  Well, Eric wasn't in bed with me now, so I had to assume he was safely ensconced in the hidey-hole. I went across the hall. As I'd promised, I put the contents back in the closet to make it look normal. The clock told me it was noon, and outside the sun was bright, though the air was cold. For Christmas, Jason had given me a thermometer that read the outside temperature and showed it to me on a digital readout inside. He'd installed it for me, too. Now I knew two things: it was noon, and it was thirty-four degrees outside.  
  
  In the kitchen, the pan of water I'd washed Eric's feet with was still sitting on the floor. As I dumped it into the sink, I saw that at some point he'd rinsed out the bottle that had held the synthetic blood. I'd have to get some more to have around when he rose, since you didn't want a hungry vampire in your house, and it would be only polite to have extra to offer Pam and whoever else drove over from Shreveport. They'd explain things to me - or not. They'd take Eric away and work on whatever problems were facing the Shreveport vampire community, and I would be left in peace. Or not.  
  
  Merlotte's was closed on New Year's Day until four o'clock. On New Year's Day, and the day after, Charlsie and Danielle and the new girl were on the schedule, since the rest of us had worked New Year's Eve. So I had two whole days off. . . and at least one of them I got to spend alone in a house with a mentally ill vampire. Life just didn't get any better.  
  
  I had two cups of coffee, put Eric's jeans in the washer, read a romance for a while, and studied my brand-new Word of the Day calendar, a Christmas gift from Arlene. My first word for the New Year was ""exsanguinate. "" This was probably not a good omen.  
  
  Jason came by a little after four, flying down my drive in his black pickup with pink and purple flames on the side. I'd showered and dressed by then, but my hair was still wet. I'd sprayed it with detangler and I was brushing through it slowly, sitting in front of the fireplace. I'd turned on the TV to a football game to have something to watch while I brushed, but I kept the sound way down. I was pondering Eric's predicament while I luxuriated in the feel of the fire's warmth on my back.  
  
  We hadn't used the fireplace much in the past couple of years because buying a load of wood was so expensive, but Jason had cut up a lot of trees that had fallen last year after an ice storm. I was well stocked, and I was enjoying the flames.  
  
  My brother stomped up the front steps and knocked perfunctorily before coming in. Like me, he had mostly grown up in this house. We'd come to live with Gran when my parents died, and she'd rented out their house until Jason said he was ready to live on his own, when he'd been twenty. Now Jason was twenty-eight and the boss of a parish road crew. This was a rapid rise for a local boy without a lot of education, and I'd thought it was enough for him until the past month or two, when he'd begun acting restless.  
  
  ""Good,"" he said, when he saw the fire. He stood squarely in front of it to warm his hands, incidentally blocking the warmth from me. ""What time did you get home last night?"" he said over his shoulder.

1ln535m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1ln535m/aita_for_wanting_a_divorce/,AITA for wanting a divorce?,"I (35F) recently told my spouse (37M) that I feel  alone, isolated and that our household centers around his wants/needs only.  We add a tiny human to our household last year, and since then it has been glaringly obvious that his needs come above everyone else in our home.  For example, his garden is top priority on the weekends, we live in the city and grocery stores are plentiful.  Even if they were not, he doesn't grow nearly enough produce for us to consider living off of it, he literally just likes playing in the dirt.  When I asked for the same me-time activity of going to the gym, I maybe get a ""yes"" once every 2 weeks, and it can not be on the weekends.  He also is musician on the side, allowing him leave for several hours on weekends and afternoons to perform.  He does this enjoyment, though it does bring a small amount of extra income.  He refuses to go grocery shopping and only does his own laundry.  I have asked for help with both things and he says he doesn't understand how to wash my clothes, so he refuses.  The biggest thing for me, which is probably the most immature thing, is that he doesn't really seem to know me or acknowledge me as a spouse.  He refuses to buy me flowers or gifts thay are not practical (he bought me a blender for Christmas so I could make baby food) because ""they are a waste of money."" Yet, he can spend thousands on his garden...that has very little practical value.

The kicker for me was my first Mother's Dag this year.  He brought me coffee in bed and showed me pictures of a necklace he planed to buy.  I asked a few days ago about when the necklace was going to arrive and he said that he decided against buying it, ""it doesn't seem practical anymore.""

Financially, we are doing fine.  

I plan to file for divorce at this point.  I feel so alone. I cry all of the time and I feel like the baby senses my sadness.  I don't know what to do.

1ln5324,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ln5324/repost_morning_phlem/,Repost: Morning Phlem,"I have a very similar issue to this minus the drinking and weight. Does anyone have any solutions as I battle this every day. 

Hi AskDocs, I’m 28M, 250 lbs. Every morning for years I always cough up or have to spit out phlegm for the first hour or two after wakeup. I got sick right after Thanksgiving in 2022 and noticed that my coughs in the morning have gotten worse. Most coughs I can literally taste the mucus in my throat/mouth. Every once in a while I can feel the “wheezy” or honking cough in my chest for trying to bring up the phlegm.

Most mornings I’ve been having 1 cup of coffee and at least 1 bottle of water to get me started then after a little bit my coughs begin and I spit out as much as I can until it subsides. Throughout the day I still periodically spit out phlegm as the day goes on though. I’ve tried gargling warm salt water, taking ACV in the morning, over the counter acid reflux medication, and allergy medicine. Nothing has made a substantial difference. Some evenings I do get the chest phlegm cough but it doesn’t happen as intense as the mornings. I did recently find a PCP and have an upcoming appointment next week but was interested if there’s any other advice. Feel free to ask questions.",1,1751168243.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1ln52ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitwarden/comments/1ln52ig/single_points_of_failure_in_your_password/,Single Points of Failure in your Password Datastore,"This is a ramble about the notion of a ""single point of failure"". It's a critical concept in modern data management, and it directly applies to how your care and feeding of your password database.

# ACID Transactions

When I graduated with my advanced college degree and started working as a software developer, I had a lot of radical ideas and vision. Just a few years in, I ended up working in a most fascinating area, where we were challenged to devise a radical new approach to managing databases.

I was very fortunate to have an excellent mentor (Alan) who was also very patient, as he worked me through the basics of database reliability. The concept is actually rather simple.  Suppose Alice pays Bob $10 for a latte. From the viewpoint of a database operation, exactly one of the following things should happen:

1. Alice ends up $10 poorer, and Bob ends up $10 richer -- this is the happy path.
2. The payment does not succeed. Alice's balance does not change. Bob's balance does not change.

Some things that should NEVER happen:

* Alice keeps her $10, Bob doesn't get paid, but Alice gets her latte.
* Alice gets charged $20 but only gets one latte.
* Bob gets paid $20 for only selling one latte.

Furthermore, Cindy may be watching the transactions. At any point, she should only see $10 in flight. Nobody is counterfeiting money, there's only $10 in process.

...and so on. In more recent years, this concept has been formalized as an [ACID property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) of database transactions:

*Atomicity*: A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations within the transaction are successfully completed and committed, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back to its previous state, preventing partial updates.

*Consistency*: A transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another valid state. It ensures that all data integrity constraints (e.g., primary key constraints, foreign key constraints) are maintained before and after the transaction.

*Isolation*: Concurrent transactions are isolated from each other, meaning that the intermediate results of one transaction are not visible to other concurrent transactions. This prevents interference and ensures that each transaction operates as if it were the only one running.

*Durability*: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanently stored and will survive system failures or crashes. This is typically achieved by writing the changes to non-volatile storage.

Every morning I would come into Alan's office with a fresh cup of coffee, and we would discuss how to make our database ACID. For weeks, he was so supportive: ""That's great, Jason! But what happens if..."", my tail would sink between my legs, and I would go back to my desk to answer a new wrinkle or corner case.

*Spoiler: it took most of a month or two, but we figured it out.*

# Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

This led to the next problem. Man, that guy was so patient with me. What happens if...

* A computer crashes in the middle of an update.
* A network connection severs during an update.
* A disk crashes during an update?
* Multiple computers crash during an update?
* Multiple disks crash during an update?
* Heck, what if an entire datacenter goes offline?

Based on ACID, the user expects to lose *at most* a single update. They should get a clear message that this one update failed (or succeeded). Either Bob got paid or he didn't.  If Alice paid Bob, she should get her latte. If her payment did not go through, Bob will know and won't give her the latte.

# SPOF in a Password Manager

All of this directly applies to your password datastore. How, exactly?

*Your client machine*

In the Bitwarden architecture, your phone or browser is *not* a SPOF. It merely holds a cached copy of your vault.

When you edit a vault entry, the changes are *only* on your machine. When you click ""Save"", the update is atomically saved to the Bitwarden servers. There is at worst a window of uncertainty of whether the change was accepted by the server (such as if your network connection goes down immediately after sending the request).  But even that is ameliorated by an ""idempotent"" request framework...but I digress.

*The Bitwarden Server*

So your client machine is not a SPOF. What about the server machine? Your Bitwarden server most assuredly uses a database with ACID properties, including  MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite. This means that if the server crashes and restarts, it will lose at most the very last transaction that was sent.

*The Bitwarden Disks*

Your Bitwarden server runs in an Azure datacenter. What if an entire disk fails? In this case, Azure itself has [disk redundancy options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-redundancy) for managing your data. [The details](https://bitwarden.com/help/data-storage/) are a bit vague. It's always a good idea for you to [have your own backups](https://github.com/djasonpenney/bitwarden_reddit/blob/main/backups.md) as well as relying on Bitwarden.

*The Azure Data Center*

What if the entire datacenter crashes? This is exactly the same question as the disks. You should make full backups from time to time.

# SPOF in your use of a Password Manager

This gets much more interesting. Preventing a SPOF in your credential datastore is a function of your own behavior.

* *Your Master Password* \-- About once a month, someone in r/Bitwarden posts in a panic, looking for a super sneaky back door because they've forgotten their master password. Your brain is a single point of failure! The master password is not optional, and your memory is not reliable. You need a recovery workflow to regain the master password. In its simplest form, you need an [emergency kit](https://github.com/djasonpenney/bitwarden_reddit/blob/main/emergency_kit.md).
* *Your 2FA* \-- if your phone dies, you could lose TOTP for one or more sites, even for Bitwarden itself. If your drunk uncle sits on your jacket, he could destroy your Yubikey.
* *Your emergency sheet* \-- if you have only one copy of the emergency sheet, it could be destroyed by natural (or unnatural) disaster.
* *Your backup* \-- if you only have one copy of the backup itself, it could become unreadable; digital media is unreliable. If your copies of the backup are only in one place, a house fire could destroy all the copies -- essentially a single point of failure again.
* *Assets to read your backup or emergency sheet* \-- the login to Google Drive where you've stored the backup, the encryption password for the backup, or possibly even the cloud service itself can all be a SPOF. That's why I go Old School and just save multiple USB thumb drives in multiple locations. Plus the encryption key for the backup is similarly distributed -- *in different places from the USB*.
* *Your death* \-- We all part from this mortal coil at some point. When that happens, someone else will need to pick up the pieces. A court order will not necessarily regain the login to your NAS with all your photographs on it. A court order may not help them salvage your assets (new roof after that house fire, anyone?). Yes, your death can potentially be a SPOF.

# Challenge for You

Do you have a single point of failure in your password manager? Are you still vulnerable to risks that are at least plausible? I mean, I'm not talking about a hundred megaton fusion bomb, but a house fire is not beyond the realm of possibility.

Think about the way you manage your risk here. An emergency sheet, full backup, and possibly some encryption are all reasonable answers. It depends on your risk model.",2,1751168191.0,Bitwarden,3,1.0,False

1. **Lattafa Khamrah:** Look. I *love* sweet boozy scents. Give me Angel's Share, Jazz Club, or BTF, I'm there. Khamrah? Smelled like someone spilled spiced rum on a sticky cinnamon bun factory floor during a heatwave. Way too dense, way too sweet. Ofc I know it’s not a Kilian dupe, duh. I still tried it. Immediate scrubber.
2. **Amouage Guidance:** Notes sounded divine: pear, rose, vanilla, woods. NOPE. On me, it was this nuclear, overly-anything bomb. This feels expensive but deeply unsettling. First spray smells like fruit that’s about to be rotten. Also smells like a woman's hooha, yep the reviews weren’t wrong (or exaggerating) when they described it as such.
3. **Tom Ford F\*ing Fabulous:** The name promised edge. The scent delivered... cloying, medicinal almond/leather/powder overload? It felt aggressively synthetic and confusing.

Perfect for *Patrick Bateman*, *Samantha Jones,* or someone who wears Thierry Mugler and Versace ready-to-wear.
4. **Kerosene Followed:** Pure, unadulterated APOCALYPSE. Not just loud, but **obnoxiously, aggressively, stick-to-everything-for-days LOUD.** Screams at you from across the room and doesn’t stop.

5. **Diptyque 34 Boulevard Saint Germain:** Supposed to be their flagship, complex signature. On me? A chaotic, dusty, overwhelming potpourri explosion. I love Diptyque in general, but this one was way too busy. Complex, yes… but in a “can you please lower your voice” kind of way. Too many notes fighting for attention, zero harmony. Like a grandpa that has a signature scent since the 80s and it’s some obscure perfume labeled “Musk for men”. **Smells like a wizard school (*****derogatory*****)**.
6. **YSL Black Opium:** A classic, I know! But wow, that coffee-vanilla-floral-patchouli combo is just... a LOT happening. Very dynamic, but ultimately confusing and headache-inducing for me. Is it edgy? Sweet? Mysterious? I don't know - and neither does this scent. It's just noise.  It’s supposed to be a chic party/nightclubbing scent. A whirlwind, sure, but like a party where everyone’s shouting different languages.

Ironically, I don’t mind perfumes that feature **oud**, *if* they’re done with balance. Oud blended with florals, citruses, or amber can be gorgeous. Something that *melds*, not mauls. But the moment it’s shrieking over everything else? Nope. I’m out.

Even my **sister**, who loves ultra-sweet stuff (Ariana Grande Cloud, Sol de Janeiro Cheirosas, CH Good Girl, Lancôme Idôle, Matiere Premiere Vanilla Powder), said **Kayali Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar** and **Bianco Latte** were *too much*. Even the **Bath & Body Works Blueberry Pancakes** gave her a sugar headache. Said it was very cloying.

And my **dad**, who has worn **Creed Aventus EDP** for years, tried the **Aventus Absolu** flanker and immediately went *“Nope. Too spicy, not my style.”* Even he drew the line at that chaos. To me it smelled fine but definitely a different demographic is being catered there. Good thing he dislikes it, it costs even more with significantly less volume than the EDP.

We add a tiny human to our household last year, and since then it has been glaringly obvious that his needs come above everyone else in our home.  For example, his garden is top priority on the weekends, we live in the city and grocery stores are plentiful.  Even if they were not, he doesn't grow nearly enough produce for us to consider living off of it, he literally just likes playing in the dirt.  When I asked for the same me-time activity of going to the gym, I maybe get a ""yes"" once every 2 weeks, and it can not be on the weekends.  He also is musician on the side, allowing him leave for several hours on weekends and afternoons to perform.  He does this enjoyment, though it does bring a small amount of extra income.  He refuses to go grocery shopping and only does his own laundry.  I have asked for help with both things and he says he doesn't understand how to wash my clothes, so he refuses.  The biggest thing for me, which is probably the most immature thing, is that he doesn't really seem to know me or acknowledge me as a spouse.  He refuses to buy me flowers or gifts thay are not practical (he bought me a blender for Christmas so I could make baby food) because ""they are a waste of money."" Yet, he can spend thousands on his garden...that has very little practical value.

The kicker for me was my first Mother's Dag this year.  He brought me coffee in bed and showed me pictures of a necklace he planed to buy.  I asked a few days ago about when the necklace was going to arrive and he said that he decided against buying it, ""it doesn't seem practical anymore.""

Financially, we are doing fine.  

I plan to file for divorce at this point.  I feel so alone. I cry all of the time and I feel like the baby senses my sadness.  I don't know what to do.

1ln50qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ln50qy/bloody_bones_by_laurell_k_hamilton/,Bloody Bones  by Laurell K. Hamilton:," Chapter 1  
  
  It was St. Patrick's Day, and the only green I was wearing was a button that read, ""Pinch me and you're dead meat. "" I'd started work last night with a green blouse on, but I'd gotten blood all over it from a beheaded chicken. Larry Kirkland, zombie-raiser in training, had dropped the decapitated bird. It did the little headless chicken dance and sprayed both of us with blood. I finally caught the damn thing, but the blouse was ruined.  
  
  I had to run home and change. The only thing not ruined was the charcoal grey suit jacket that had been in the car. I put it back on over a black blouse, black skirt, dark hose, and black pumps. Bert, my boss, didn't like us wearing black to work, but if I had to be at the office at seven o'clock without any sleep at all, he would just have to live with it.  
  
  I huddled over my coffee mug, drinking it as black as I could swallow it. It wasn't helping much. I stared at a series of 8-by-10 glossy blowups spread across my desktop. The first picture was of a hill that had been scraped open, probably by a bulldozer. A skeletal hand reached out of the raw earth. The next photo showed that someone had tried to carefully scrape away the dirt, showing the splintered coffin and bones to one side of the coffin. A new body. The bulldozer had been brought in again. It had plowed up the red earth and found a boneyard. Bones studded the earth like scattered flowers.  
  
  One skull spread its unhinged jaws in a silent scream. A scraggle of pale hair still clung to the skull. The dark, stained cloth wrapped around the corpse was the remnants of a dress. I spotted at least three femurs next to the upper half of a skull. Unless the corpse had had three legs, we were looking at a real mess.  
  
  The pictures were well done in a gruesome sort of way. The color made it easier to differentiate the corpses, but the high gloss was a little much. It looked like morgue photos done by a fashion photographer. There was probably an art gallery in New York that would hang the damn things and serve cheese and wine while people walked around saying, ""Powerful, don't you think? Very powerful. ""  
  
  They were powerful, and sad.  
  
  There was nothing but the photos. No explanation. Bert had said to come to his office after I'd looked at them. He'd explain everything. Yeah, I believed that. The Easter Bunny is a friend of mine, too.  
  
  I gathered the pictures up, slipped them into the envelope, picked my coffee mug up in the other hand, and went for the door.  
  
  There was no one at the desk. Craig had gone home. Mary, our daytime secretary, didn't get in until eight. There was a two-hour space of time when the office was unmanned. That Bert had called me into the office when we were the only ones there bothered me a lot. Why the secrecy?  
  
  Bert's office door was open. He sat behind his desk, drinking coffee, shuffling some papers around. He glanced up, smiled, and motioned me closer. The smile bothered me. Bert was never pleasant unless he wanted something.  
  
  His thousand-dollar suit framed a white-on-white shirt and tie. His grey eyes sparkled with good cheer. His eyes are the color of dirty window glass, so sparkling is a real effort. His snow-blond hair had been freshly buzzed. The crewcut was so short I could see scalp.  
  
  ""Have a seat, Anita. ""  
  
  I tossed the envelope on his desk and sat down. ""What are you up to, Bert?"" His smile widened. He usually didn't waste the smile on anybody but clients. He certainly didn't waste it on me. ""You looked at the pictures?""  
  
  ""Yeah, what of it?""  
  
  ""Could you raise them from the dead?""  
  
  I frowned at him and sipped my coffee. ""How old are they?""  
  
  ""You couldn't tell from the pictures?""  
  
  ""In person I could tell you, but not just from pictures. Answer the question. ""  
  
  ""Around two hundred years. ""  
  
  I just stared at him. ""Most animators couldn't raise a zombie that old without a human sacrifice. ""  
  
  ""But you can,"" he said.  
  
  ""Yeah. I didn't see any headstones in the pictures. Do we have any names?""  
  
  ""Why?""  
  
  I shook my head. He'd been the boss for five years, started the company when it was just him and Manny, and he didn't know shit about raising the dead. ""How can you hang around a bunch of zombie-raisers for this many years and know so little about what we do?""  
  
  The smile slipped a little, the glow beginning to fade from his eyes. ""Why do you need names?""  
  
  ""You use names to call the zombie from the grave. ""  
  
  ""Without a name you can't raise them?""  
  
  ""Theoretically, no,"" I said.  
  
  ""But you can do it,"" he said. I didn't like how sure he was.  
  
  ""Yeah, I can do it. John can probably do it, too. ""  
  
  He shook his head. ""They don't want John. ""  
  
  I finished the last of my coffee. ""Who's they?""  
  
  ""Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, and Lowenstein. ""  
  
  ""A law firm,"" I said.  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  ""No more games, Bert. Just tell me what the hell's going on. ""  
  
  ""Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, and Lowenstein have some clients building a very plush resort in the mountains near Branson. A very exclusive resort. A place where the wealthy country stars that don't own a house in the area can go to get away from the crowds. Millions of dollars are at stake. ""  
  
  ""What's the old cemetery have to do with it?""  
  
  ""The land they're building on was in dispute between two families. The courts decided the Kellys owned the land, and they were paid a great deal of money. The Bouvier family claimed it was their land and there was a family plot on it to prove it. No one could find the cemetery. ""  
  
  Ah. ""They found it,"" I said.  
  
  ""They found an old cemetery, but not necessarily the Bouvier family plot. ""  
  
  ""So they want to raise the dead and ask who they are?""  
  
  ""Exactly. ""  
  
  I shrugged. ""I can raise a couple of the corpses in the coffins. Ask who they are. What happens if their last name is Bouvier?""  
  
  ""They have to buy the land a second time. They think some of the corpses are Bouviers. That's why they want all the bodies raised. ""  
  
  I raised my eyebrows. ""You're joking. ""  
  
  He shook his head, looking pleased. ""Can you do it?""  
  
  ""I don't know. Give me the pictures again. "" I set my coffee mug on his desk and took the pictures back. ""Bert, they've screwed this six ways to Sunday. It's a mass grave, thanks to the bulldozers. The bones are all mixed together. I've only read about one case of anyone raising a zombie from a mass grave. But they were calling a specific person. They had a name. "" I shook my head. ""Without a name it may not be possible. ""  
  
  ""Would you be willing to try?""  
  
  I spread the pictures over the desk, staring at them. The top half of a skull had turned upside down like a bowl. Two finger bones attached by something dry and desiccated that must once had been human tissue lay next to it. Bones, bones everywhere but not a name to speak.  
  
  Could I do it? I honestly didn't know. Did I want to try? Yeah. I did.  
  
  ""I'd be willing to try. ""  
  
  ""Wonderful. ""  
  
  ""Raising them a few every night is going to take weeks, even if I can do it. With John's help it would be quicker. ""  
  
  ""It will cost them millions to delay that long,"" Bert said.  
  
  ""There's no other way to do it. ""  
  
  ""You raised the Davidsons' entire family plot, including Great-Grandpa. You weren't even supposed to raise him. You can raise more than one at a time. ""  
  
  I shook my head. ""That was an accident. I was showing off. They wanted to raise three family members. I thought I could save them money by doing it in one shot. ""  
  
  ""You raised ten family members, Anita. They only asked for three. ""  
  
  ""So?""  
  
  ""So can you raise the entire cemetery in one night?""  
  
  ""You're crazy,"" I said. r />  
  ""Can you do it?""  
  
  I opened my mouth to say no, and closed it. I had raised an entire cemetery once. Not all of them had been two centuries old, but some of them had been older, nearly three hundred. And I raised them all. Of course, I had two human sacrifices to ride for power. It was a long story how I ended up with two people dying inside a circle of power. Self-defense, but the magic didn't care. Death is death.  
  
  Could I do it? ""I really don't know, Bert. ""  
  
  ""That's not a no,"" he said. He had an eager, anticipatory look on his face.  
  
  ""They must have offered you a bundle of money,"" I said.  
  
  He smiled. ""We're bidding on the project. ""  
  
  ""We're what?""  
  
  ""They sent this package to us, the Resurrection Company in California and the Essential Spark in New Orleans. ""  
  
  ""They prefer ¨¦lan Vital to the English translation,"" I said. Frankly, it sounded more like a beauty salon than an animating firm, but nobody had asked me. ""So what? The lowest bid gets it?""  
  
  ""That was their plan,"" Bert said.  
  
  He looked entirely too satisfied with himself. ""What?"" I asked.  
  
  ""Let me play it back to you,"" he said. ""There are what, three animators in the entire country that could raise a zombie that old without a human sacrifice? You and John are two of them. I'm including Phillipa Freestone of Resurrection in this. ""  
  
  ""Probably,"" I said.  
  
  He nodded. ""Okay. Could Phillipa raise without a name?""  
  
  ""I don't have any way of knowing that. John could. Maybe she could. ""  
  
  ""Could either she or John raise from the mass bones, not the ones in the coffin?""  
  
  That stopped me. ""I don't know. ""  
  
  ""Would either of them stand a chance of raising the entire graveyard?"" He was staring at me very steadily.  
  
  ""You're enjoying this too much,"" I said.  
  
  ""Just answer the question, Anita. ""  
  
  ""I know John couldn't do it. I don't think Phillipa is as good as John, so no, they couldn't do it. ""  
  
  ""I'm going to up the bid,"" Bert said.  
  
  I laughed. ""Up the bid?""  
  
  ""Nobody else can do it. Nobody but you. They tried treating this like any other construction problem. But there aren't going to be any other bids, now are there?""  
  
  ""Probably not,"" I said.  
  
  ""Then I'm going to take them to the cleaners,"" he said with a smile.  
  
  I shook my head. ""You greedy son of a bitch. ""  
  
  ""You get a share of the fee, you know. ""  
  
  ""I know. "" We looked at each other. ""What if I try and can't raise them all in one night?""  
  
  ""You'll still be able to raise them all eventually, won't you?""  
  
  ""Probably. "" I stood, picking up my coffee mug. ""But I wouldn't spend the check until after I've done it. I'm going to go get some sleep. ""  
  
  ""They want the bid this morning. If they accept our terms, they'll fly you up in a private helicopter. ""  
  
  ""Helicopter--you know I hate to fly. ""  
  
  ""For this much money you'll fly. ""  
  
  ""Great. ""  
  
  ""Be ready to go at a moment's notice. ""  
  
  ""Don't push it, Bert. "" I hesitated at the door. ""Let me take Larry with me. ""  
  
  ""Why? If John can't do it, then Larry certainly can't. ""  
  
  I shrugged. ""Maybe not, but there are ways to combine power during a raising. If I can't do it alone, maybe I can get a boost from our trainee. ""  
  
  He looked thoughtful. ""Why not take John? Combined, you could do it. ""  
  
  ""Only if he'd give his power willingly to me. You think he'd do that?""  
  
  Bert shook his head.  
  
  ""You going to tell him that the client didn't want him? That you offered him to the client and they asked for me by name?""  
  
  ""No,"" Bert said.  
  
  ""That's why you're doing it like this; no witnesses. ""  
  
  ""Time is of the essence, Anita. ""  
  
  ""Sure, Bert, but you didn't want to face Mr. John Burke with yet another client that wants me over him. ""  
  
  Bert looked down at his blunt-fingered hands clasped on the desktop. He looked up, grey eyes serious. ""John is almost as good as you are, Anita. I don't want to lose him. ""  
  
  ""You think he'll walk if one more client asks for me?""  
  
  ""His pride's hurt,"" Bert said.  
  
  ""And there's so much of it to hurt,"" I said.  
  
  Bert smiled. ""You needling him doesn't help. ""  
  
  I shrugged. It sounded petty to say he'd started it, but he had. We'd tried dating, and John couldn't handle me being a female version of him. No; he couldn't handle me being a better version of him.  
  
  ""Try to behave yourself, Anita. Larry's not up to speed yet; we need John. ""  
  
  ""I always behave myself, Bert. ""  
  
  He sighed. ""If you didn't make me so much money, I wouldn't put up with your shit. ""  
  
  ""Ditto,"" I said.  
  
  That about summed up our relationship. Commerce at its best. We didn't like each other, but we could do business together. Free enterprise at work.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  At noon Bert called and said we had it. ""Be at the office packed and ready to go at two o'clock. Mr. Lionel Bayard will fly up with you and Larry. ""  
  
  ""Who's Lionel Bayard?""  
  
  ""A junior partner in the firm of Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, and Lowenstein. He likes the sound of his own voice. Don't give him a rough time about it. ""  
  
  ""Who, me?""  
  
  ""Anita, don't tease the help. He may be wearing a three-thousand-dollar suit, but he's still the help. ""  
  
  ""I'll save it up for one of the partners. Surely Beadle, Beadle, Stirling, or Lowenstein will appear in person sometime this weekend. ""  
  
  ""Don't tease the bosses either,"" he said.  
  
  ""Anything you say. "" My voice was utterly mild.  
  
  ""You'll do whatever you want no matter what I say, won't you?""  
  
  ""Gee, Bert, who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?""  
  
  ""Just be here at two o'clock. I called Larry. He'll be here. ""  
  
  ""I'll be there, Bert. I've got one stop to make, so if I'm a few minutes late, don't worry. ""  
  
  ""Don't be late. ""  
  
  ""Be there as soon as I can. "" I hung up before he could argue with me.  
  
  I had to shower, change, and go to Seckman Junior High School. Richard Zeeman taught science there. We had a date set up for tomorrow. At one point Richard had asked me to marry him. That was sort of on hold, but I did owe him more than a message on his answering machine, saying sorry, honey, can't make the date. I'm going to be out of town. A message would have been easier for me, but cowardly.  
  
  I packed one suitcase. It was enough for four days and then some. If you pack extra underwear and clothes that mix and match, you can live for a week out of a small suitcase.  
  
  I did add a few extras. The Firestar 9mm and its inner pants holster. Enough extra ammo to sink a battleship and two knives plus wrist sheaths. I'd had four knives. All handcrafted for little ol' moi. Two of them had been lost beyond recovery. I was having them replaced, but hand forging takes time, especially when you insist on the highest silver content possible in the steel. Two knives, two guns should be enough for one weekend business trip. I'd wear the Browning Hi-Power.  
  
  Packing wasn't a problem. What to wear today was the problem. They'd want me to raise them tonight if I could. Hell, the helicopter might fly directly to the construction site. Which meant I'd be walking over raw dirt, bones, shattered coffins. It didn't sound like high-heel territory. Yet, if a junior partner was wearing a three-thousand-dollar suit, the people who'd just hired me would expect me to look the part. I could either dress professionally or in feathers and blood. I'd actually had one client who was disappointed that I didn't show up nude smeared with blood. There could have been more than one reason for his disappointment. I don't think I've ever had a client that would have objected to some kind of ceremonial getup, but jeans and jogging shoes didn't seem to inspire confidence. Don't ask me why.  
  
  I could pack my cover  
all and put it over whatever I wore. Yeah, I liked that. Veronica Sims--Ronnie, my very best friend--had talked me into buying a fashionably short navy skirt. It was short enough that I was a little embarrassed, but the skirt fit inside the coverall. The skirt didn't wrinkle or bunch up after I'd worn the outfit to vampire stakings or murder scenes. Take the coverall off, and I was set to go to the office or out for the evening. I was so pleased, I went out and bought two more in different colors.  
  
  One was crimson, the other purple. I hadn't been able to find one in black yet. At least not one that wasn't so short that I refused to wear it. Admittedly, the short skirts made me look taller. They even made me look leggy. When you're five-foot-three, that's saying something. But the purple didn't match much that I owned, so crimson it was.  
  
  I'd found a short-sleeved blouse that was the exact same shade of red. Red with violet undertones, a cold, hard color that looked great with my pale skin, black hair, and dark brown eyes. The shoulder holster and 9mm Browning Hi-Power looked very dramatic against it. A black belt cinched tight at the waist held down the loops on the holster. A black jacket with rolled-back sleeves went over everything to hide the gun. I twirled in front of the mirror in my bedroom. The skirt wasn't much longer than the jacket, but you couldn't see the gun. At least not easily. Unless you're willing to have things tailor-made, it's hard to hide a gun, especially in women's dress-up clothes.  
  
  I put on just enough makeup so the red didn't overwhelm me. I was also going to be saying good-bye to Richard for several days. A little makeup couldn't hurt. When I say makeup, I mean eye shadow, blush, lipstick, and that's it. Outside of a television interview that Bert talked me into, I don't wear base.  
  
  Except for the hose and black high heels, which I would've had to wear no matter what skirt I wore, the outfit was comfortable. As long as I remembered not to bend directly at the waist, I was safe.  
  
  The only jewelry I wore was the silver cross tucked into the blouse, and the watch on my wrist. My dress watch had broken and I just had never gotten around to getting it fixed. The present watch was a man's black diving watch that looked out of place on my small wrist. But hey, it glowed in the dark if you pressed a button. It showed me the date, what day it was, and could time a run. I hadn't found a woman's watch that could do all that.  
  
  I didn't have to cancel running with Ronnie tomorrow morning. She was out of town on a case. A private detective's work is never done.  
  
  I loaded the suitcase into my Jeep and was on the way to Richard's school by one o'clock. I was going to be late to the office. Oh, well. They'd wait for me or they wouldn't. It wouldn't break my heart to miss the helicopter ride. I hated planes, but a helicopter. . . scared the shit out of me.  
  
  I hadn't been afraid of flying until I was on a plane that plunged several thousand feet in seconds. The stewardess ended up plastered against the ceiling, covered in coffee. People screamed and prayed. The elderly woman beside me recited the Lord's Prayer in German. She'd been so scared, tears had come down her face. I offered her my hand, and she gripped it. I knew I was going to die and there was nothing I could do to prevent it. But we would die holding on to human hands. Die covered in human tears, and human prayers. Then the plane straightened out and suddenly we were safe. I haven't trusted air transportation since.  
  
  Normally in St. Louis there is no real spring. There's winter, two days of mild weather, and summer heat. This year spring had come early and stayed. The air was soft against your skin. The wind smelled of green growing things, and winter seemed to have been a bad dream. Redbuds bent from the trees on either side of the road. Tiny purple blossoms like a delicate lavender mist here and there through the naked trees. There were no leaves yet, but there was a hint of green. Like someone had taken a giant paintbrush and tinted everything. Look directly at them and the trees were bare and black, but look sideways, not at a particular tree but at all the trees, and there was a touch of green.  
  
  270 South is about as pleasant as a highway can be; it gets you where you're going fairly fast, and it's over quickly. I exited at Tesson Ferry Road. The road is thick with strip malls, a hospital, and fast-food restaurants, and when you leave the commerce behind you hit new housing developments so thick they nearly touch. There are still stands of woods and open spaces, but they won't last.  
  
  The turn to Old 21 is at the crest of a hill just past the Meramec River. It is mostly houses with a few gas stations, the area water district office, and a large gas field to the right. Where the hills march out and out.  
  
  At the first stoplight I turned left past a little shopping area. The road is a curving narrow thing that snakes between houses and woods. There were glimpses of daffodils in the yards. The road dips down into a valley, and at the bottom of a steep hill is a stop sign. The road climbs quickly to the crest of a hill, to a T, turn left and you're almost there.  
  
  The one-story school sits on the floor of a wide, flat valley surrounded by hills. Having been raised in Indiana farm country, I'd have called them mountains once. The elementary school sits separate, but close enough to share a playground. If you got recess in junior high. When I was too little to go to junior high, it seemed you did get recess. By the time I got there, you didn't. The way of the world.  
  
  I parked as close to the building as I could. This was my second visit to Richard's school, and my first during the actual school day. We'd come once to get some papers he'd forgotten. No students then. I entered the main entrance and ran into a crowd. It must have been between classes when they moved the warm bodies from one room to another.  
  
  I was instantly aware that I was about the same height as or shorter than everyone I saw. There was something claustrophobic about being jostled by the book-carrying, backpack-wearing crowd. There had to be a circle of Hell where you were eternally fourteen, eternally in junior high. One of the lower circles.  
  
  I flowed with the crowd towards Richard's room. I admit I took comfort in the fact that I was better dressed than most of the girls. Petty as hell, but I had been chunky in junior high. There isn't a lot of difference between chunky and fat when it comes to teasing. I'd had my growth spurt and never been fat again. That's right; I'd been even tinier once. Shortest kid in school for years and years.  
  
  I stood to one side of the doorway, letting the students come and go. Richard was showing something in a textbook to a young girl. She was blonde, wearing a flannel shirt over a black dress that was three sizes too big for her. She was wearing what looked like black combat boots with heavy white socks rolled over the tops of them. The outfit was very now. The look of adoration on her face was not. She was shiny and eager just because Mr. Zeeman was giving her some one-on-one help.  
  
  I had to admit that Richard was worth a crush or two. His thick brown hair was tied back in a ponytail that gave the illusion that his hair was very short and close to his head. He has high, full cheekbones and a strong jaw, with a dimple that softens his face and makes him look almost too perfect. His eyes are a solid chocolate brown with those thick lashes that so many men have and women want. The bright yellow shirt made his permanently tanned skin seem even darker. His tie was a dark, rich green that matched the dress slacks he wore. His jacket was draped across the back of his desk chair. The muscles in his upper arms worked against the cloth of his shirt as he held the book.  
  
  The class was mostly seated, the hallway nearly silent. He closed the book and handed it to the girl. She smiled and scrambled for the door, late to her next class. Her eyes flicked over me as she passed, wondering what I was doing there.  
  
  She wasn't the only one. Several of the seated students were glancing my way. I stepped into the room.  
  
  Richard smiled. It warmed me down to my toes. The smile saved him from being too handsome. It wasn't that it wasn't a great smile. He could have done toothpaste commercials. But the smile was a little boy's smile, open and welcoming. There was no guile to Richard, no deep, dark plan. He was the world's biggest Boy Scout. The smile showed that.  
  
  
  I wanted to go to him, have him wrap his arms around me. I had a horrible urge to grab his tie and lead him out of the room. I wanted to touch his chest underneath the yellow shirt. The urge was so strong, I put my hands in the pockets of my jacket. Mustn't shock the students. Richard affects me like that sometimes. Okay, most of the time when he's not furry, or licking blood off his fingers. He's a werewolf. Did I mention that? No one at the school knows. If they did, he'd be out of a job. People don't like lycanthropes teaching their precious kiddies. It's illegal to discriminate against someone for a disease, but everyone does it. Why should the educational system be different?  
  
  He touched my cheek, just his fingertips. I turned my face into his hand, brushing lips against his fingers. So much for being cool in front of the kiddies. There were a few oohs and nervous laughs.  
  
  ""I'll be right back, guys. "" More oohs, louder laughter, one ""Way to go, Mr. Zeeman. "" Richard motioned me out the door and I went, hands still in my pockets. Normally, I'd have said I wasn't going to embarrass myself in front of a bunch of eighth-graders, but lately I wasn't entirely trustworthy.  
  
  Richard led me a little ways from his classroom into the deserted hallway. He leaned up against the wall of lockers and looked down at me. The little-boy smile was gone. The look in his dark eyes made me shiver. I ran my hand down his tie, smoothing it against his chest.  
  
  ""Am I allowed to kiss you, or would that scandalize the kiddies?"" I didn't look up at him as I asked. I didn't want him to see the raw need in my eyes. It was embarrassing enough that I knew he sensed it. You can't hide lust from a werewolf. They can smell it.  
  
  ""I'll risk it. "" His voice was soft, low, with a warm edge that made my stomach clench.  
  
  I felt him bend over me. I raised my face to his. His lips were so soft. I leaned against his body, palms flat against his chest. I could feel his nipples harden under my skin. My hands slid to his waist, smoothing along the cloth of his shirt. I wanted to pull his shirt out of his pants and run my hands over bare skin. I stepped back from him feeling just a little breathless.  
  
  It was my idea that we wouldn't have sex before marriage. My idea. But damn, it was hard. The more we dated, the harder it got.  
  
  ""Jesus, Richard. "" I shook my head. ""It gets harder, doesn't it?""  
  
  Richard's smile didn't look innocent or Boy Scoutish in the least. ""Yes, it does. ""  
  
  Heat rushed up my face. ""I didn't mean that. ""  
  
  ""I know what you meant. "" His voice was gentle, taking the sting out of the teasing.  
  
  My face was still hot with embarrassment, but my voice was steady. Point for me. ""I've got to go out of town on business. ""  
  
  ""Zombie, vampire, or police?""  
  
  ""Zombie. ""  
  
  ""Good. ""  
  
  I looked up at him. ""Why good?""  
  
  ""I worry more when you go away on police business, or vampire stakings. You know that. ""  
  
  I nodded. ""Yeah, I know that. "" We stood there in the hallway, staring at each other. If things had been different, we'd be engaged, maybe planning a wedding. All this sexual tension would have been coming to some kind of conclusion. As it was. . .  
  
  ""I'm going to be late as it is. I've got to go. ""  
  
  ""Are you going to tell Jean-Claude bye in person?"" His face was neutral when he asked, but his eyes weren't.  
  
  ""It's daylight. He's in his coffin. ""  
  
  ""Ah,"" Richard said.  
  
  ""I didn't have a date planned with him this weekend, so I don't owe him an explanation. Is that what you wanted to hear?""  
  
  ""Close enough,"" he said. He took a step away from the lockers, bringing our bodies very close together. He bent to kiss me good-bye. Giggles erupted down the hall.  
  
  We turned to see most of his class huddled in the doorway gazing at us. Great.  
  
  Richard smiled. He raised his voice enough so they'd hear him. ""Back inside, you monsters. ""  
  
  There were catcalls, and one small brunette girl gave me a very dirty look. I think there must have been a lot of girls that had a crush on Mr. Zeeman.  
  
  ""The natives are restless. I've got to get back. ""  
  
  I nodded. ""I'm hoping to be back by Monday. ""  
  
  ""We'll go hiking next weekend, then. ""  
  
  ""I put Jean-Claude off this weekend. I can't not see him two weeks in a row. ""  
  
  Richard's face clouded up with the beginnings of anger. ""Hike during the day, see the vampire at night. Only fair. ""  
  
  ""I don't like this any better than you do,"" I said.  
  
  ""I wish I believed that. ""  
  
  ""Richard. ""  
  
  He gave a long sigh. The anger sort of leaked out of him. I never understood how he did that. He could be furious one minute and calm the next. Both emotions seemed genuine. Once I was angry, I was angry. Maybe it's a character flaw?  
  
  ""I'm sorry, Anita. It's not like you're dating him behind my back. ""  
  
  ""I would never do anything behind your back; you know that. ""  
  
  He nodded. ""I know that. "" He glanced back at his classroom. ""I've got to go before they set the room on fire. "" He walked down the hallway without looking back.  
  
  I almost called after him, but I let him go. The mood was sort of spoiled. Nothing like knowing your girlfriend is dating someone else to take the wind out of your sails. I wouldn't have put up with it if it was the other way around. A double standard that, but one we could all three live with. If living was the term for Jean-Claude.  
  
  Oh, hell, my personal life was too confusing for words. I walked off down the hall, having to pass by his open classroom door. My high heels made loud, rackety echoes. I didn't try to catch a last glimpse of him. It would make me feel worse about leaving.  
  
  It hadn't been my idea to date the Master of the City. Jean-Claude had given me two choices; either he could kill Richard, or I could date both of them. It had seemed a good idea at the time. Five weeks later I wasn't so sure.  
  
  It had been my morals that had kept Richard and me from consummating our relationship. Consummating, nice euphemism. But Jean-Claude had made it clear that if I did something with Richard, I had to do it with him too. Jean-Claude was trying to woo me. If Richard could touch me but he couldn't, it wasn't fair. He had a point, I guess. But the thought of having to have sex with the vampire was more likely to keep me chaste than any high ideals.  
  
  I couldn't date both of them indefinitely. The sexual tension alone was killing me. I could move. Richard might even let me do that. He wouldn't like it, but if I wanted free of him, he'd let me go. Jean-Claude, on the other hand. . . He'd never let me go. The question was, did I want him to let me go? Answer: hell, yes. The real trick was how to break free without anybody dying.  
  
  Yeah, that was the $64,000 question. Trouble was, I didn't have an answer. We were going to need one sooner or later. And later was getting closer all the time.

1ln4ziq,https://i.redd.it/i83zq1x8ds9f1.jpeg,Final Casting Call for my Dark Humor Web Series!,"Hi everyone!

I’m Angel Diaz, co-creator of The Zoo of Misadventures, a dark humor animated web series about Pascal the polar bear clown whose attempts to spread joy usually end in hilarious chaos…and lots of cartoonish death.

We already have a great team of voice actors for most main roles, but we’re looking to fill seven more characters to complete our core cast.

Here’s who we still need:


---

Remaining Roles:

🐆 Othello the Puma (Male)

Puma's dialogue consists of mispronunciations and stuttering, though this doesn't stop him from being very vocal. He's outgoing!! May we need to say more?


🐼 Boris the Panda (Male)

Drowsy and lazy voice, but loud and booming when he does speak.

Imagine a sleepy giant who randomly bellows out complaints. Like my mom.


🐨 Kiki the Koala (Female)

Nervous and jittery, talks fast because she’s constantly hopped up on coffee.

Lots of energy and anxiety in her delivery.


🦊 Baroness Blanche du Nord (Female)

The richest Arctic fox in the world. She lives in a huge mansion up on the mountains. She also loves wine, jewels, and money.

Elegant, powerful, slightly sinister French accent.

Think Cruella de Vil meets a Bond villain. She also hates Pascal with a passion( 


🦄 Oliver the Unicorn (Male)

Extremely upbeat and energetic.

Always trying to cheer everyone up (even during disasters).

Bright, enthusiastic delivery.


🦓 Zavier the Zebra (Male)

Teasing, competitive, always trying to one-up the others.

Friendly but a little cocky tone.


🐧 Quinton the Penguin (Male)

Calm, polite, speaks with a classic British accent.

Always the gentleman, no matter what chaos is happening around him.

0430 Hours

I wake before the alarm, like always.

Not out of discipline, but out of dread. My stomach lurches before I even sit up, but I breathe through it. This is week nine. I think. I’ve stopped counting days. I count uniform sizes now. I count seconds between waves of nausea. I count lies I’ve told to cover it up. Zipper doesn’t know. He doesn’t get to.

That’s the decision I made months ago, when I stared at that plastic stick shaking in my hand in the base clinic bathroom. Two pink lines, one certainty: I’m doing this without him.

He made his choice months ago—when he transferred, when he ghosted, when he stopped calling me anything other than “Sergeant Major” in front of the others. It was clean, clinical. Classic Zipper.

But this? This little heartbeat? This isn’t his anymore. It’s mine.

0515

Hair in a bun. Uniform on. My chest feels tight either from hormones or the fact that I can’t button my top without standing perfectly straight.

I rub my lower back as I do a sweep of the office. Desks clean. Reports stacked. I check the NCO barracks too. One trash can’s overflowing, I make a note. A corporal walking past calls me “ma’am” by mistake. I don’t correct him. I’m too tired.

0600 – PT

I lead from the sidelines now. “Modified participation,” I told them. “Old injuries acting up.”

No one asks questions. They’re too busy trying not to throw up themselves from the hill sprints.

Meanwhile, I breathe through the waves of nausea like it’s combat breathing. Controlled. Rhythmic. Tactical.

0900 – Staff Briefing

Zipper’s not here thank God. I don’t think I could handle seeing him today. I’ll admit it I already deleted every picture of us from Facebook and Instagram. Scrubbed it clean like it never happened. Easier to breathe that way.

He’s stationed across base now, in charge of logistics. Our paths don’t cross much anymore and that’s by design.

I sip mint tea from a mug labeled “World’s Okayest Marine.” It was a gag gift. Right now, it feels uncomfortably accurate.

Lieutenant James starts a joke about “being tied down with kids someday” and I just smile like I don’t already know what it’s like to feel the weight of your whole life rerouted in one doctor’s visit.

1300 – 1700

The rest of the day is pure routine.

A Marine gets NJP’d for insubordination. I sit in on the hearing, calm and collected, even as my stomach growls and cramps from skipping lunch.

I tour the motor pool. Pretend I don’t feel like passing out. Nod through logistics reports that blur like static.

1800 – Evening Colors

Retreat. I stand at attention, and watch the flag lower like always.

No one can see my hands tremble. No one can see my belt pinching across a body that’s already changing. No one knows my whole life is quietly rearranging itself around a life that doesn’t even have a name yet. But I know. And that’s enough.

1930

I pick up pre-natal vitamins from the commissary. The cashier, a sweet lance corporal, doesn’t blink. Just scans and bags. I pay in cash.

On the walk to my car, my phone buzzes. I don’t have to look. It’s Zipper. Probably saw me on the appointment list through shared systems. He always did have a knack for digging where he shouldn’t. I ignore it. I eat toast in silence.

Then I write in the cheap journal I bought from the PX: “Day 63. No coffee. No contact. No regrets.”

I think about all the usual things people say about women in the Marines:

That we’re a liability. That we get pregnant to avoid deployment. That we’re too emotional, too soft, too much drama.
That we break units down instead of building them up.

Maybe it’s the hormones talking or the fact that the only thing I’ve kept down all day is saltine crackers and chicken soup but today, it hits different.

Still, I pick up my pen and write:

“You’re not here yet, but I’m already fighting for you.”

Because that’s what Marines do. Even when no one’s watching. Even when no one knows.

(Looking for walkable area + access to good quality coffee, gyms, food, and decent cocktail lounges to take friends who visit me (25M))?","Hey everyone, I’m moving to Chicago soon and would love some advice from anyone familiar with the neighborhoods.

I’m a 25 year old Mexican guy (though I apparently look Wasian), raised in LA and currently based in ATL, I don't go out much. I’ll be working downtown in the Loop and won’t have a car, so walkability and good CTA access are must-haves. I spend weekends working on side projects, working out, and eating lol. I have a GF (24F) who will be visiting me here and there as well. We love to just go get coffee and walk around.

Right now I’m looking at a room in a house near Damen & Armitage in Bucktown for $1,000/month. It seems like a great deal, but I want to make sure the neighborhood actually fits what I’m looking for before locking it in.

Here’s what matters to me:

* Great coffee shops where I can walk to, chill, and get some work done on weekends
* Solid local gyms for lifting weights (long shot but if anyone has been to Urban Body fitness in Atlanta, thats the vibe I'm looking for)
* A good Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym nearby
* Amazing Asian and Hispanic food, or good food in general
* Cocktail bars I can take friends to when they visit

Would love your take on whether Bucktown around Damen & Armitage checks those boxes, or if I should keep looking in neighborhoods like Pilsen, or certain parts of Lincoln Park or Uptown?

i’m currently seeking a new psychologist who is more well-versed in detransition, i’ve reached out to a few i found online. (if you have any recs for a psychologist or psychotherapist, i’d appreciate them!)

however the social aspect of detransition is very isolating, many of my friends are men or trans, i would really appreciate a setting where i can meet other people going through a similar process (or questioning).

a little about me: i study computer science at uni and i hope to join the women in computer science group this year :-) i love fashion, animals, video games, and music

if you’re in/near toronto and know of any resources, or want to grab coffee and chat, feel free to comment or DM.

Tall, handsome, charming, fit married man in western CT seeks a good girl who wants to help him get hard. As men age, we need special attention to arouse us...are you feeling sexy and up to the task?

I understand -- you may be uncomfortable that I am married. But my wife has had health issues for years that eliminated her desire for sex...so we no longer have intimacy together...which is difficult for me...If we did, I would not be here at all. But I still have strong sexual cravings and desires...and I would love to find someone with whom I can share them.

You should be enthusiastic, curious, maybe a bit shy, and seriously crave the attention of an experienced, sensual man who will focus on making you feel safe, desired and delicious!

If you happen to have an older man or married daddy kink...that would be fun.

Let’s chat and meet for a coffee to see how we get along. No pressure…just flirting, then, if we like each other, maybe some kissing and discreet fun.

Females only, please. Please be within a 90 min drive of western CT.

  The blaze of sun wrung pops of sweat from the old man’s brow, yet he cupped his hands around the glass of hot sweet tea as if to warm them. He could not shake the premonition. It clung to his back like chill wet leaves.  
  
  The dig was over. The tell had been sifted, stratum by stratum, its entrails examined, tagged and shipped: the beads and pendants; glyptics; phalli; ground-stone mortars stained with ocher; burnished pots. Nothing exceptional. An Assyrian ivory toilet box. And man. The bones of man. The brittle remnants of cosmic torment that once made him wonder if matter was Lucifer upward-groping back to his God. And yet now he knew better. The fragrance of licorice plant and tamarisk tugged his gaze to poppied hills; to reeded plains; to the ragged, rock-strewn bolt of road that flung itself headlong into dread. Northwest was Mosul; east, Erbil; south was Baghdad and Kirkuk and the fiery furnace of Nebuchadnezzar. He shifted his legs underneath the table in front of the lonely roadside chaykhana and stared at the grass stains on his boots and khaki pants. He sipped at his tea. The dig was over. What was beginning? He dusted the thought like a clay-fresh find but he could not tag it.  
  
  Someone wheezed from within the chaykhana: the withered proprietor shuffling toward him, kicking up dust in Russian-made shoes that he wore like slippers, groaning backs pressed under his heels. The dark of his shadow slipped over the table.  
  
  “Kaman chay, chawaga?”  
  
  The man in khaki shook his head, staring down at the laceless, crusted shoes caked thick with debris of the pain of living. The stuff of the cosmos, he softly reflected: matter; yet somehow finally spirit. Spirit and the shoes were to him but aspects of a stuff more fundamental, a stuff that was primal and totally other.  
  
  The shadow shifted. The Kurd stood waiting like an ancient debt. The old man in khaki looked up into eyes that were damply bleached as if the membrane of an eggshell had been pasted over the irises. Glaucoma. Once he could not have loved this man. He slipped out his wallet and probed for a coin among its tattered, crumpled tenants: a few dinars; an Iraqi driver’s license; a faded plastic Catholic calendar card that was twelve years out of date. It bore an inscription on the reverse: WHAT WE GIVE TO THE POOR IS WHAT WE TAKE WITH US WHEN WE DIE. He paid for his tea and left a tip of fifty fils on a splintered table the color of sadness.  
  
  He walked to his jeep. The rippling click of key sliding into ignition was crisp in the silence. For a moment he paused and stared off broodingly. In the distance, shimmering in heat haze that made it look afloat like an island in the sky, loomed the flat-topped, towering mound city of Erbil, its fractured rooftops poised in the clouds like a rubbled, mud-stained benediction.  
  
  The leaves clutched tighter at the flesh of his back.  
  
  Something was waiting.  
  
  “Allah ma’ak, chawaga.”  
  
  Rotted teeth. The Kurd was grinning, waving farewell. The man in khaki groped for a warmth in the pit of his being and came up with a wave and a mustered smile. It dimmed as he looked away. He started the engine, turned in a narrow, eccentric U and headed toward Mosul. The Kurd stood watching, puzzled by a heart-dropping sense of loss as the jeep gathered speed. What was it that was gone? What was it he had felt in the stranger’s presence? Something like safety, he remembered; a sense of protection and deep well-being. Now it dwindled in the distance with the fast-moving jeep. He felt strangely alone.  
  
  By ten after six the painstaking inventory was finished. The Mosul curator of antiquities, an Arab with sagging cheeks, was carefully penning a final entry into the ledger on his desk. For a moment he paused, looking up at his friend as he dipped his pen-point into an inkpot. The man in khaki seemed lost in thought. He was standing by a table, hands in his pockets, staring down at some dry, tagged whisper of the past. Curious, unmoving, for moments the curator watched him, then returned to the entry, writing in a firm, very small neat script until at last he sighed, setting down the pen as he noted the time. The train to Baghdad left at eight. He blotted the page and offered tea.  
  
  His eyes still fixed upon something on the table, the man in khaki shook his head. The Arab watched him, vaguely troubled. What was in the air? There was something in the air. He stood up and moved closer; then felt a vague prickling at the back of his neck as his friend at last moved, reaching down for an amulet and cradling it pensively in his hand. It was a green stone head of the demon Pazuzu, personification of the southwest wind. Its dominion was sickness and disease. The head was pierced. The amulet’s owner had worn it as a shield.  
  
  “Evil against evil,” breathed the curator, languidly fanning himself with a French scientific periodical, an olive-oil thumbprint smudged on its cover.  
  
  His friend did not move; he did not comment. The curator tilted his head to the side. “Is something wrong?” he asked.  
  
  No answer.  
  
  “Father Merrin?”  
  
  The man in khaki still appeared not to hear, absorbed in the amulet, the last of his finds. After a moment he set it down, then lifted a questioning look to the Arab. Had he said something?  
  
  “No, Father. Nothing.”  
  
  They murmured farewells.  
  
  At the door, the curator took the old man’s hand with an extra firmness.  
  
  “My heart has a wish: that you would not go.”  
  
  His friend answered softly in terms of tea; of time; of something to be done.  
  
  “No, no, no! I meant home!”  
  
  The man in khaki fixed his gaze on  
a speck of boiled chickpea nestled in a corner of the Arab’s mouth; yet his eyes were distant. “Home,” he repeated.  
  
  The word had the sound of an ending.  
  
  “The States,” the Arab curator added, instantly wondering why he had.  
  
  The man in khaki looked into the dark of the other’s concern. He had never found it difficult to love this man. “Goodbye,” he said quietly; then quickly turned and stepped out into the gathering gloom of the streets and a journey home whose length seemed somehow undetermined.  
  
  “I will see you in a year!” the curator called after him from the doorway. But the man in khaki never looked back. The Arab watched his dwindling form as he crossed a narrow street at an angle, almost colliding with a swiftly moving droshky. Its cab bore a corpulent old Arab woman, her face a shadow behind the black lace veil draped loosely over her like a shroud. He guessed she was rushing to some appointment. He soon lost sight of his hurrying friend.  
  
  The man in khaki walked, compelled. Shrugging loose of the city, he breached the outskirts, crossing the Tigris with hurrying steps, but nearing the ruins, he slowed his pace, for with every step the inchoate presentiment took firmer, more terrible form.  
  
  Yet he had to know. He would have to prepare.  
  
  A wooden plank that bridged the Khosr, a muddy stream, creaked under his weight. And then he was there, standing on the mound where once gleamed fifteen-gated Nineveh, feared nest of Assyrian hordes. Now the city lay sprawled in the bloody dust of its predestination. And yet he was here, the air was still thick with him, that Other who ravaged his dreams.  
  
  The man in khaki prowled the ruins. The Temple of Nabu. The Temple of Ishtar. He sifted vibrations. At the palace of Ashurbanipal he stopped and looked up at a limestone statue hulking in situ. Ragged wings and taloned feet. A bulbous, jutting, stubby penis and a mouth stretched taut in feral grin. The demon Pazuzu.  
  
  Abruptly the man in khaki sagged.  
  
  He bowed his head.  
  
  He knew.  
  
  It was coming.  
  
  He stared at the dust and the quickening shadows. The orb of the sun was beginning to slip beneath the rim of the world and he could hear the dim yappings of savage dog packs prowling the fringes of the city. He rolled his shirtsleeves down and buttoned them as a shivering breeze sprang up. Its source was southwest.  
  
  He hastened toward Mosul and his train, his heart encased in the icy conviction that soon he would be hunted by an ancient enemy whose face he had never seen.  
  
  But he knew his name.  
  
  The Beginning  
  
  Chapter One  
  
  Like the brief doomed flare of exploding suns that registers dimly on blind men’s eyes, the beginning of the horror passed almost unnoticed; in the shriek of what followed, in fact, was forgotten and perhaps not connected to the horror at all. It was difficult to judge.  
  
  The house was a rental. Brooding. Tight. A brick colonial gripped by ivy in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. Across the street was a fringe of campus belonging to Georgetown University; to the rear, a sheer embankment plummeting steep to busy M Street and, just beyond it, the River Potomac. Early on the morning of April 1, the house was quiet. Chris MacNeil was propped in bed, going over her lines for the next day’s filming; Regan, her daughter, was sleeping down the hall; and asleep downstairs in a room off the pantry were the middle-aged housekeepers, Willie and Karl. At approximately 12:25 A.M., Chris looked up from her script with a frown of puzzlement. She heard rapping sounds. They were odd. Muffled. Profound. Rhythmically clustered. Alien code tapped out by a dead man.  
  
  Funny.  
  
  For a moment she listened, then dismissed it; but as the rappings persisted she could not concentrate. She slapped down the script on the bed.  
  
  Jesus, that bugs me!  
  
  She got up to investigate.  
  
  She went out to the hallway and looked around. The rappings seemed to be coming from Regan’s bedroom.  
  
  What is she doing?  
  
  She padded down the hall and the rappings grew suddenly louder, much faster, and as she pushed on the door and stepped into the room, they abruptly ceased.  
  
  What the freak’s going on?  
  
  Her pretty eleven-year-old was asleep, cuddled tight to a large stuffed round-eyed panda. Pookey. Faded from years of smothering; years of smacking, warm, wet kisses.  
  
  Chris moved softly to her bedside, leaned over and whispered. “Rags? You awake?”  
  
  Regular breathing. Heavy. Deep.  
  
  Chris shifted her glance around the room. Dim light from the hall fell pale and splintery on Regan’s paintings and sculptures; on more stuffed animals.  
  
  Okay, Rags. Your old mother’s ass is draggin’. Come on, say it! Say “April Fool!”  
  
  And yet Chris knew well that such games weren’t like her. The child had a shy and diffident nature. Then who was the trickster? A somnolent mind imposing order on the rattlings of heating or plumbing pipes? Once, in the mountains of Bhutan, she had stared for hours at a Buddhist monk who was squatting on the ground in meditation. Finally, she thought she had seen him levitate, though when recounting the story to someone, she invariably added “Maybe.” And maybe now her mind, she thought, that untiring raconteur of illusion, had embellished the rappings.  
  
  Bullshit! I heard it!  
  
  Abruptly, she flicked a quick glance to the ceiling.  
  
  There! Faint scratchings.  
  
  Rats in the attic, for pete’s sake! Rats!  
  
  She sighed. That’s it. Big tails. Thump, thump! She felt oddly relieved. And then noticed the cold. The room. It was icy.  
  
  Chris padded to the window and checked it. Closed. Then she felt the radiator. Hot.  
  
  Oh, really?  
  
  Puzzled, she moved to the bedside and touched her hand to Regan’s cheek. It was smooth as thought and lightly perspiring.  
  
  I must be sick!  
  
  Chris looked at her daughter, at the turned-up nose and freckled face, and on a quick, warm impulse leaned over the bed and kissed her cheek. “I sure do love you,” she whispered. After that she returned to her room and her bed and her script.  
  
  For a while, Chris studied. The film was a musical comedy remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. A subplot had been added that dealt with campus insurrections. Chris was starring. She played a psychology teacher who sided with the rebels. And she hated it. This scene is the pits! she thought. It’s dumb! Her mind, though untutored, never took slogans for the truth, and like a curious bluejay she would peck relentlessly through verbiage to find the glistening, hidden fact. And so the rebel cause didn’t make any sense to her. But how come? she now wondered. Generation gap? That’s a crock; I’m thirty-two. It’s just stupid, that’s all, it’s a…!  
  
  Cool it. Only one more week.  
  
  They’d completed the interiors in Hollywood and all that remained to be filmed were a few exterior scenes on the campus of Georgetown University, starting tomorrow.  
  
  Heavy lids. She was getting drowsy. She turned to a page that was curiously ragged. Her British director, Burke Dennings. When especially tense, he would tear, with quivering, fluttering hands, a narrow strip from the edge of the handiest page of the script and then slowly chew it, inch by inch, until it was all in a wet ball in his mouth.  
  
  Crazy Burke, Chris thought.  
  
  She covered a yawn, then fondly glanced at the side of her script. The pages looked gnawed. She remembered the rats. The little bastards sure got rhythm, she thought. She made a mental note to have Karl set traps for them in the morning.  
  
  Fingers relaxing. Script slipping loose. She let it drop. Dumb, she thought. It’s dumb. A fumbling hand groping out to the light switch. There. She sighed, and for a time she was motionless, almost asleep; and then she kicked off her covers with a lazy leg.  
  
  Too hot! Too freaking hot! She thought again about the puzzling coldness of Regan’s room and into her mind flashed a recollection of working in a film with Edward G. Robinson, the legendary gangster movie star of the 1940s, and wondering why in every scene they did together she was always close to shivering from the co  
ld until she realized that the wily old veteran had been managing to stand in her key light. A faint smile of bemusement now, and as a mist of dew clung gently to the windowpanes. Chris slept. And dreamed about death in the staggering particular, death as if death were still never yet heard of while something was ringing, she gasping, dissolving, slipping off into void while thinking over and over, I am not going to be, I will die, I won’t be, and forever and ever, oh, Papa, don’t let them, oh, don’t let them do it, don’t let me be nothing forever and melting, unraveling, ringing, the ringing—  
  
  The phone!  
  
  She leaped up with her heart pounding, hand to the phone and no weight in her stomach; a core with no weight and her telephone ringing.  
  
  She answered. The assistant director.  
  
  “In makeup at six, honey.”  
  
  “Right.”  
  
  “How ya feelin’?”  
  
  “Like I just went to bed.”  
  
  The AD chuckled. “I’ll see you.”  
  
  “Yeah, right.”  
  
  Chris hung up the phone and for moments sat motionless, thinking of the dream. A dream? More like thought in the half life of waking: That terrible clarity. Gleam of the skull. Nonbeing. Irreversible. She could not imagine it.  
  
  God, it can’t be!  
  
  Dejected, she bowed her head.  
  
  But it is.  
  
  She padded to the bathroom, put on a robe, then quickly pattered down old pine steps to the kitchen, down to life in sputtering bacon.  
  
  “Ah, good morning, Mrs. MacNeil!”  
  
  Gray, drooping Willie, squeezing oranges, blue sacs beneath her eyes. A trace of accent. Swiss. Like Karl’s. She wiped her hands on a paper towel and started moving toward the stove.  
  
  “I’ll get it, Willie.” Chris, ever sensitive, had seen the housekeeper’s weary look, and as Willie now grunted and turned back to the sink, the actress poured coffee, then sat down in the breakfast nook, where, looking down at her plate, she smiled fondly at a blush-red rose against its whiteness. Regan. That angel. Many a morning, when Chris was working, Regan would quietly slip out of bed, come down to the kitchen to place a flower on her mother’s empty plate and then grope her way crusty-eyed back to her sleep. On this particular morning, Chris ruefully shook her head as she recalled that she had contemplated naming her Goneril. Sure. Right on. Get ready for the worst. Chris faintly smiled at the memory. She sipped at her coffee and as her gaze caught the rose again, her expression turned briefly sad, her green eyes grieving in a waiflike face. She’d recalled another flower. A son. Jamie. He had died long ago at the age of three, when Chris was very young and an unknown chorus girl on Broadway. She had sworn she would not give herself ever again as she had to Jamie; as she had to his father, Howard MacNeil; and as her dream of death misted upward in the vapors from her hot, black coffee, she lifted her glance from the rose and her thoughts as Willie brought juice and set it down before her.

  
  Chris remembered the rats.  
  
  “Where’s Karl?”  
  
  “I am here, Madam!”  
  
  He’d come catting in lithely through a door off the pantry. Commanding and yet deferential, he had a fragment of Kleenex pressed to his chin where he’d nicked himself shaving. “Yes?” Thickly muscled and tall, he breathed by the table with glittering eyes, a hawk nose and bald head.  
  
  “Hey, Karl, we’ve got rats in the attic. Better get us some traps.”  
  
  “There are rats?”  
  
  “I just said that.”  
  
  “But the attic is clean.”  
  
  “Well, okay, we’ve got tidy rats!”  
  
  “No rats.”  
  
  “Karl, I heard them last night.”  
  
  “Maybe plumbing,” Karl probed; “maybe boards.”  
  
  “Maybe rats! Will you buy the damn traps and quit arguing?”  
  
  Bustling away, Karl, said, “Yes! I go now!”  
  
  “No not now, Karl! The stores are all closed!”  
  
  “They are closed!” chided Willie, calling out to him.  
  
  But he was gone.  
  
  Chris and Willie traded glances, and then, shaking her head, Willie returned to her tending of the bacon. Chris sipped at her coffee. Strange. Strange man, she thought. Like Willie, hardworking; very loyal, very discreet. And yet something about him made her vaguely uneasy. What was it? That subtle air of arrogance? No. Something else. But she couldn’t pin it down. The housekeepers had been with her for almost six years, and yet Karl was a mask—a talking, breathing, untranslated hieroglyph running her errands on stilted legs. Behind the mask, though, something moved; she could hear his mechanism ticking like a conscience. The front door creaked open, then shut. “They are closed,” muttered Willie.  
  
  Chris nibbled at bacon, then returned to her room, where she dressed in her costume sweater and skirt. She glanced in a mirror and solemnly stared at her short red hair, which looked perpetually tousled; at the burst of freckles on the small, scrubbed face; and then crossing her eyes and grinning idiotically, she said, Oh, hi, little wonderful girl next door! Can I speak to your husband? Your lover? Your pimp? Oh, your pimp’s in the poorhouse? Tough! She stuck out her tongue at herself. Then sagged. Ah, Christ, what a life! She picked up her wig box, slouched downstairs and walked out to the piquant, tree-lined street.  
  
  For a moment she paused outside the house, breathing in the fresh promise of morning air, the muted everyday sounds of waking life. She turned a wistful look to her right, where, beside the house, a precipitous plunge of old stone steps fell away to M Street far below, while a little beyond were the antique brick rococo turrets and Mediterranean tiled roof of the upper entry to the old Car Barn. Fun. Fun neighborhood, she thought. Dammit, why don’t I stay? Buy the house? Start to live? A deep, booming bell began to toll, the tower clock on the Georgetown University campus. The melancholy resonance shivered on the surface of the mud-brown river and seeped into the actress’s tired heart. She walked toward her work, toward ghastly charade and the straw-stuffed, antic imitation of dust.  
  
  As she entered the main front gates of the campus, her depression diminished; then lessened even more as she looked at the row of trailer dressing rooms aligned along the driveway close to the southern perimeter wall; and by 8 A.M. and the day’s first shot, she was almost herself: she started an argument over the script.  
  
  “Hey, Burke? Take a look at this damned thing, will ya?”  
  
  “Oh, you do have a script, I see! How nice!” Director Burke Dennings, taut and elfin and with a twitching left eye that gleamed with mischief, surgically shaved a narrow strip from a page of her script with quivering fingers, cackling, “I believe I’ll have a bit of munch.”  
  
  They were standing on the esplanade that fronted the university’s main administration building and were knotted in the center of extras, actors and the film’s main crew, while here and there a few spectators dotted the lawn, mostly Jesuit faculty. The cameraman, bored, picked up Daily Variety as Dennings put the paper in his mouth and giggled, his breath reeking faintly of the morning’s first gin.  
  
  “Oh, yes, I’m terribly glad you’ve been given a script!”  
  
  A sly, frail man in his fifties, he spoke with a charmingly broad British accent so clipped and precise that it lofted even the crudest obscenities to elegance, and when he drank, he seemed always on the verge of a guffaw; seemed constantly struggling to retain his composure.  
  
  “Now then, tell me, my baby. What is it? What’s wrong?”  
  
  The scene in question called for the dean of the mythical college in the script to address a gathering of students in an effort to squelch a threatened sit-in. Chris would then run up the steps to the esplanade, tear the bullhorn away from the dean and then point to the main administration building and shout, “Let’s tear it down!”  
  
  “It doesn’t make any sense,” Chris told him.  
  
  “Well, it’s perfectly plain,” Dennings lied.  
  
  “Oh, it is? Well, then explain it to me, Burkey-Wurky. Why in freak should they tear down the building? What for? What’s your concept?”  
  
  “Are you sending me up?”  
  
  “No, I’m asking ‘what for?’ ”  
  
  “Because it’s there, love!”  
  
  “In the script?”  
  
  “No, on the grounds!”  
  
  “Oh, come on, Burke, it just isn’t her. It’s not her character at all. She wouldn’t do that.”  
  
  “She would.”  
  
  “No, she wouldn’t.”  
  
  “Shall we summon the writer? I believe he’s in Paris!”  
  
  “Hiding?”  
  
  “Fucking!”  
  
  He’d clipped the word off with impeccable diction, his fox eyes glinting in a face like dough as the word rose crisp to Gothic spires. Chris fell to his shoulders, weak and laughing. “Oh, Burke, you’re impossible, dammit!”  
  
  “Yes.” He said it like Caesar modestly confirming reports of his triple rejection of the crown. “Now then, shall we get on with it?”  
  
  Chris didn’t hear him. Checking to see if he’d heard the obscenity, she’d darted a furtive, embarrassed glance to a Jesuit in his forties standing amid the cordon of spectators. He had a dark, rugged face. Like a boxer’s. Chipped. Something sad about the eyes, something grieving, and yet warm and reassuring as they fastened on hers and as, smiling, he nodded his head. He’d heard it. He glanced at his watch and moved away.  
  
  “I say, shall we get on with it?”  
  
  Chris turned, disconnected. “Yeah, sure, Burke. Let’s do it.”  
  
  “Thank heaven.”  
  
  “No, wait!”  
  
  “Oh, good Christ!”  
  
  She complained about the tag of the scene. She felt that the high point was reached with her line as opposed to her running through the door of the building immediately afterward.  
  
  “It adds nothing,” said Chris. “It’s dumb.”  
  
  “Yes, it is, love, it is,” agreed Burke sincerely. “However, the cutter insists that we do it,” he continued, “so there we are. You see?”  
  
  “No, I don’t.”  
  
  “No, of course you don’t, darling, because you’re absolutely right, it is stupid. You see, since the scene right after it”—Dennings giggled—“well, since it begins with Jed coming into the scene through a door, the cutter feels certain of a nomination if the scene before it ends with you moving off through a door.”  
  
  “Are you kidding?”  
  
  “Oh, I agree with you, love. It’s simply cunting, puking mad! But now why don’t we shoot it and trust me to snip it from the final cut. It should make a rather tasty munch.”  
  
  Chris laughed. And agreed. Burke glanced toward the cutter, who was known to be a temperamental egotist given to time-wasting argumentation. He was busy with the cameraman. The director breathed a sigh of relief.  
  
  Waiting on the lawn at the base of the steps while the lights were warming, Chris looked toward Dennings as he flung an obscenity at a hapless grip and then visibly glowed with satisfaction. He seemed to revel in his eccentricity. Yet at a certain point in h  
is drinking, Chris knew, he could suddenly explode into temper, and if it happened at three or four in the morning, he was likely to telephone people in power and viciously abuse them over trifling provocations. Chris remembered a studio chief whose offense had consisted in remarking mildly at a screening that the cuffs of Dennings’s shirt looked slightly frayed, prompting Dennings to awaken him at approximately 3 A.M. to describe him as a “cunting boor” whose father, the founder of the studio, was “more than likely psychotic!” and had “fondled Judy Garland repeatedly” during the filming of The Wizard of Oz, then on the following day would pretend to amnesia and subtly radiate with pleasure when those he’d offended described in detail what he had done. Although, if it suited him, he would remember. Chris smiled and shook her head as she remembered him destroying his studio suite of offices in a ginstoked, mindless rage, and how later, when confronted by the studio’s head of production with an itemized bill and Polaroid photos of the wreckage, he’d archly dismissed them as “obvious fakes” since “the damage was far, far worse than that!” Chris did not believe he was an alcoholic or even a hopeless problem drinker, but rather that he drank and behaved outrageously because it was expected of him: he was living up to his legend.  
  
  Ah, well, she thought; I guess it’s a kind of immortality.  
  
  She turned, looking over her shoulder for the Jesuit who had smiled when Burke had uttered the obscenity. He was walking in the distance, head lowered despondently, a lone black cloud in search of the rain. She had never liked priests. So assured. So secure. And yet this one…  
  
  “All ready, Chris?”  
  
  “Ready.”  
  
  “All right, absolute quiet!” the assistant director called out.  
  
  “Roll the film,” ordered Burke.  
  
  “Rolling!”  
  
  “Speed!”  
  
  “Now action!”  
  
  Chris ran up the steps while extras cheered and Dennings watched her, wondering what was on her mind. She’d given up the arguments far too quickly. He turned a significant look to the dialogue coach, who immediately padded up to him dutifully and proffered his open script to him like an aging altar boy handing the missal to his priest at solemn Mass.  
  
  They had worked with only intermittent sun, and by four, the sky was dark and thick with roiling clouds.  
  
  “Burke, we’re losing the light,” the AD observed worriedly.  
  
  “Yes, they’re going out all across the fucking world.”  
  
  On Dennings’s instruction the assistant director dismissed the company for the day and now Chris was walking homeward, her eyes on the sidewalk, and feeling very tired. At the corner of Thirty-sixth and O she stopped to sign an autograph for an aging Italian grocery clerk who had hailed her from the doorway of his shop. She wrote her name and “Warm Best Wishes” on a brown paper bag. Waiting for a car to pass before crossing the road at N Street, she glanced diagonally across the street to a Catholic church. Holy Something-or-other. Staffed by Jesuits. John F. Kennedy had married Jackie there, she had heard, and had worshiped there. She tried to imagine it: John F. Kennedy among the votive lights and the pious, wrinkled women; John F. Kennedy with his head bowed down in prayer; I believe … a détente with the Russians; I believe, I believe … Apollo IV amid the rattlings of the rosary beads; I believe in the resurrection and the life ever—  
  
  That. That’s it. That’s the grabber.  
  
  Chris watched as a Gunther beer truck lumbered by on the cobbled street with a sound of quivering, warm, wet promises.  
  
  She crossed, and as she walked down O and passed the Holy Trinity grade school auditorium, a priest rushed by from behind her, hands in the pockets of a nylon windbreaker. Young. Very tense. In need of a shave. Up ahead, he took a right, turning into an easement that opened to a courtyard behind the church.  
  
  Chris paused by the easement, watching him, curious. He seemed to be heading for a white frame cottage. An old screen door creaked open and still another priest emerged. He nodded curtly toward the young man, and with lowered eyes, he moved quickly toward a door that led into the church. Once again the cottage door was pushed open from within. Another priest. It looked—Hey, it is! Yeah, the one who was smiling when Burke said “fucking”! Only now he looked grave as he silently greeted the new arrival, putting his arm around his shoulder in a gesture that was gentle and somehow parental. He led him inside and the screen door closed with a slow, faint squeak.  
  
  Chris stared at her shoes. She was puzzled. What’s the drill? She wondered if Jesuits went to confession.  
  
  Faint rumble of thunder. She looked up at the sky. Would it rain? … the resurrection and the life ever…  
  
  Yeah. Yeah, sure. Next Tuesday. Flashes of lightning crackled in the distance. Don’t call us, kid, we’ll call you.  
  
  She tugged up her coat collar and slowly moved on.  
  
  She hoped it would pour.  
  
  A minute later she was home. She made a dash for the bathroom. After that, she walked into the kitchen.  
  
  “Hi, Chris, how’d it go?”  
  
  Pretty blonde in her twenties sitting at the table. Sharon Spencer. Fresh. From Oregon. For the last three years, she’d been tutor to Regan and social secretary to Chris.  
  
  “Oh, the usual crock.” Chris sauntered to the table and began to sift messages. “Anything exciting?”  
  
  “Do you want to have dinner next week at the White House?”  
  
  “Oh, I dunno, Marty; whadda you feel like doin’?”  
  
  “Eating candy and getting sick.”  
  
  “Where’s Rags?”  
  
  “Downstairs in the playroom.”  
  
  “What doin’?”  
  
  “Sculpting. She’s making a bird, I think. It’s for you.”  
  
  “Yeah, I need one,” Chris murmured. She moved to the stove and poured a cup of hot coffee. “Were you kidding me about that dinner?” she asked.  
  
  “No, of course not,” answered Sharon. “It’s Thursday.”  
  
  “Big dinner party?”  
  
  “No, I gather it’s just five or six people.”  
  
  “Hey, neat-o!”  
  
  She was pleased but not really surprised. They courted her company: cabdrivers; poets; professors; kings. What was it they liked about her? Life?  
  
  Chris sat at the table. “How’d the lesson go?”  
  
  Sharon lit a cigarette, frowning. “Had a bad time with math again.”  
  
  “Really? That’s strange.”  
  
  “Yeah, I know; it’s her favorite subject.”  
  
  “Oh, well, this ‘new math.’ Christ, I couldn’t make change for the bus if—”  
  
  “Hi, Mom!”  
  
  Her slim arms outstretched, Chris’s young daughter had come bounding through the door toward her mother. Red pigtails. A soft, shining face full of freckles.  
  
  “Hi ya, stinkpot!” Beaming, Chris caught her in a bear hug and kissed her pink cheek with smacking ardor; she could not repress the full flood of her love. “Mmum-mmum-mmum!” More kisses. Then she held Regan out and probed her face with eager eyes. “So what’djya do today? Anything exciting?”  
  
  “Oh, stuff.”  
  
  “So what kinda stuff? Good stuff? Huh?”  
  
  “Oh, lemme see.” She had her knees against her mother’s, swaying gently back and forth. “Well, of course, I studied.”  
  
  “Uh-huh.”  
  
  “An’ I painted.”  
  
  “Wha’djya paint?”  
  
  “Oh, well, flowers, ya know. Daisies? Only pink. An’ then—oh, yeah! This horse!” She grew suddenly excited, eyes widening. “This man had a horse, ya know, down by the river? We were walking, see, Mom, and then along came this horse, he was beautiful! Oh, Mom, ya should’ve seen him, and the man let me sit on him! Really! I mean, practically a minute!”  
  
  Chris twinkled at Sharon with secret amusement. “Himself?” she asked, lifting an eyebrow. On moving to Washington for the shooting of the film, the blonde secretary, who was now virtually one of the family, had lived in the house, occupying an extra bedroom upstairs. Until she’d met the “horseman” at a nearby stable, at which point Chris decided that Sharon  
needed a place to be alone, and had moved her to a suite in an expensive hotel and insisted on paying the bill.  
  
  “Yes, himself,” Sharon answered with a smile.  
  
  “It was a gray horse!” added Regan. “Mother, can’t we get a horse? I mean, could we?”  
  
  “We’ll see, baby.”  
  
  “When could I have one?”  
  
  “We’ll see. Where’s the bird you made?”  
  
  At first Regan looked blank, then she turned around to Sharon and grinned with a mouth full of braces and shy rebuke. “You told!” she said before turning to her mother and snickering, “It was supposed to be a surprise.”  
  
  “You mean…?”  
  
  “With the long funny nose, like you wanted!”  
  
  “Oh, Rags, you’re so sweet. Can I see it?”  
  
  “No, I still have to paint it. When’s dinner, Mom?”  
  
  “Hungry?”  
  
  “I’m starving.”  
  
  “Gee, it’s not even five. When was lunch?” Chris asked Sharon.  
  
  “Oh, twelvish,” Sharon answered.  
  
  “When are Willie and Karl coming back?”  
  
  Chris had given them the afternoon off.  
  
  “I think seven,” said Sharon.  
  
  “Mom, can’t we go Hot Shoppe?” Regan pleaded. “Could we?”  
  
  Chris lifted her daughter’s hand; smiled fondly, kissed it, then answered, “Run upstairs and get dressed and we’ll go.

1ln4u7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ln4u7t/are_my_parents_applying_double_standards/,Are my parents applying double standards?,"Hello. I (22F) live with my parents and my little brother (16M). Both my friends and his friends often come over. I hate when my brother’s friends visit because of their poor hygiene. Before coming over, they usually play basketball or other sports, and they arrive all sweaty without taking a shower or changing their clothes. I hate the smell when they are here. That said, my parents have never said anything to my brother about his or his friends’ hygiene.

On the other hand, my friends are all very clean girls. Obviously, they don’t bring the disgusting foot odor that my brother and his friends do. My friends usually go barefoot in our house since they wear sandals and take them off when they come in.

Yesterday, two of my friends came over. Our house was slightly cold, and one of them put her feet on the coffee table in the living room. To me, this is totally normal behavior. However, after they left, my parents warned me that it was very rude for my friend to place her bare feet on the coffee table and told me I need to make sure it doesn’t happen again. They also said they find it rude that my friends walk around barefoot in the house without socks or slippers, and that I should talk to them about their behavior if I want to keep inviting them.

I found this very strange because, in my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with what they did. They are clean, and it’s completely normal to be barefoot. I also don’t see the problem with putting your feet on the coffee table. I think it’s really unfair that my brother has never been warned about his friends’ poor hygiene, while my parents criticize my clean friends for being barefoot.

This is the ""Chef's Curated Menu"" which is basically a tasting menu of some of their popular dishes, but you can also order a la carte. $90 pp, coffee I bought extra at the end ($5 iirc).

1. Mezes to start: Hummus (with cute little falafels), Babaghanoush, and the more unique ""Banru"" which is a spicy three cheese dip that hails from the Armenian majority town of Anjar, Lebanon.
2. Bread to go with the mezes
3. Mini-Fattoush salad - Personally, I like more crispy greens with my fattoush, but this was fine.
4. Grilled prawn on top of smoked labneh
5. Manteh
6. Lamb chops
7. Confit potatoes - The toum here is addictive
8. New dessert that's intended to be gluten and dairy free. ""Millefeuille"" with I believe a gluten free lavash (I'm assuming rice based?), some rice crackers on top, and a resteh cream made from coconut cream. Interesting mix of cultures here, though the overall flavour profile leans Southeast Asian to me.
9. Armenian Coffee

I don't have a good frame of reference for mediterranean cuisine when it comes to cost performance honestly, but I enjoyed the meal and was full at the end. Tbh I was having trouble finishing the meal, but I'm a small dude. Highlights for me were the mezes and prawn. I could probably do without the lamb chop and the dessert, but I'm admittedly a bit bored of lamb chops on menus these days, so this is just a preference thing.

I was away in the country for a week, just seeking some quiet and stillness as my life gets rather hectic and I had not written creatively in quite some time...in fact my art had definitely been pushed to the side over the past few years—especially since the onset of the pandemic and becoming a voice for fellow disabled people in my community.

I was sitting on my own, on a very cold, grey, and cloudy day. I felt the weather was reflecting back how I was feeling and had a sudden rush to begin writing something...anything! I had no clear idea of the subject, I just wanted to write. What happened really quite surprised me, and my subconscious found it's voice.  
  
I ended up with a poem inspired by Tommy Cash, no doubt due to how much of his art and content I had engaged with recently. But, I had written it without any intention to do so. It was organic, real, and raw.

  
TL;DR Here is the poem.

  
***Tommy.***

*The world is grey, cold, bleak, wistful.*  
*I sit alone, in my discontent and quiet fear.*  
*What will tomorrow be?*

*I shelter from the storm, only for it to stir in me.*  
*Only for it to come crashing through my door, and find its place inside my head.*

*The world no longer feels safe.*  
*It feels ugly and isolating.*  
*I feel unwanted. Discarded.*

*But then a switch is flipped.*  
*A comfort found in absurdity. In oddity.*  
*This post-soviet provocateur is reflecting back my own aspirations.*  
*The artist I want to be, presents as a pencil moustache with braids.*

*I do not just see differently now, I dream differently too.*  
*I find inspiration. Direction. Courage.*

*Courage to expose myself to the world.*  
*Courage to let people see the real me.*  
*Courage to once again create in the gloriously absurd way that feels authentic to me.*

*A simple cup of coffee, masks the significance of the moment.*  
*It will lead me down an unknown path that will see me free.*  
*A flame ignites from the forgotten embers,*  
*and guides my wounded soul back home.*

*What will tomorrow be? I do not yet know,*  
*but I’m at least now excited to find out.*

I’ve posted here a few months ago (I wrote how challenging it can be to make friends in Marin if you’re not middle-age-retirement age) and am glad to report that I’ve successfully met some very fun and cool people!🙌

We have an informal What’s App group where we can connect for plans to do various fun local things: mainly brunches, dinners, hikes/walks, drinks/appetizers/coffee/tea, events, workshops, local parties, etc. Many of us are fairly busy, so it’s pretty casual and there’s no pressure to do things if you aren’t able to. The idea is that it’s like a meetup group, only more informal/less structured.

As much as I love kids (I used to teach and babysit), our activities aren’t oriented towards children, so if you’re looking for a group to bring your kid to, this won’t be your best option (Marin is very family-oriented, so I’m sure you’ll have no difficulty in finding that elsewhere!). The age part isn’t meant to discriminate against anyone but rather to create connections of people in a similar stage of life, so if you’re somewhat above or below the age suggestion you’re still welcome to join. Also welcome to anyone who identifies as a woman, regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, etc. Please feel free to comment or DM if you’re interested in joining🙂",11,1751167218.0,Marin,4,0.92,False

1ln4kvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1ln4kvg/should_i_run_away_from_my_home/,Should I Run Away From My Home??,"For context, I’m an 18M and out of high school, my mum is 45 my dad is 63.

About 20mins ago I just got into an argument with my parents. Long story short I tried once again setting a boundary with my mum about her commenting and trying to control my life whether that be through guilt tripping me, gas lighting or just straight up insulting me. But as always she says that I can’t do that because I haven’t experienced the things she’s experienced in her life so having an opinion on something like my own life, isn’t allowed or something like that, I don’t even really know what she’s saying anymore.

Anyway my dad joins in and supports my mum in saying that if I wasn’t such a lazy piece of shit and got a job than I can have an opinion on what I do with my life since they support me financially as a child. Also for the record, since January this year I’ve been searching for jobs and applied to 26 and done 3 trials all of which have said no because they don’t have enough money to train me. Also I know this isn’t really an excuse, but I’ve also been struggling a lot with my life over the past 5 years and I don’t really have any friends/family to turn to support so it’s hard to stay motivated to keep going with my life, which is why I am sometimes lazy.

Anyway about five more minutes of my parents saying that I’m lazy and worthless to them and how I should be grateful for them to even care enough to give me my own room, I lost it and just got up to leave to my room to which my dad said another insult that really got to me so I turned around and threw my coffee cup to the ground which of course shattered. (I know I shouldn’t have done this but I really couldn’t control it anymore). I went to my room which my dad tried to kick the door down to what I’d presumably be hit me, lucky I was able to block off the door, but then my parents started yelling at me saying that they’re going to throw me out on the street and that I’m this and that and you get the point. In the heat of the moment I said I will so that they’d stop trying to get in, but my dad full charged through the door which send me flying back and he got in my face pointing and yelling at me and all about how he’s had to put up with me for too many years and that he’s sick of dealing with me and that he’s ashamed that I don’t have a job or anything. My mum joined in and threw a suitcase at me and said how much she wants me to leave. I yelled at her and she said what did she do wrong and I said about how she literally just called me a piece of shit to which she initially denied, then confirmed and then told me not to twist her words all within 30s of her calling me a piece of shit.

They’ve left now after I said that I’ll pack my bags and everything, and now I’ve had a shower and calmed down I just don’t know what to do. It’s not like this is our first time yelling at each other, we’ve always argued at least once or twice a week depending on if they had a good day at work or not. I don’t really see a situation where this resolves and I’ll still talk to them, especially when they’re so damn openly homophobic and I’m gay and they don’t know nor does anyone else in my life knows but they’ve made me feel so isolated and alone because of they’re open homophobia that I’ve internalised so much hate of myself. 

The reason why I don’t know if I should leave or not, is because my dream job is to be an airline pilot and there’s this airliner flight school that would get me to that level really fast, but it’s $100,000 + $400/week AUD for accommodation. Obviously I don’t have that money, and their support would make it a lot easier on me, but first I got to get in, and I’d only know if I get in, in mid August. 

Anyway as for where I’d live if I left, my sister and her boyfriend has their own apartment and my sister has said before that I’m welcome to have a sleepover if my parents ever get too much, but I’m not sure about staying there for more than a week or so but I’m sure she’d be supportive, I just don’t want to impose on their life. 

But I know if I stay nothing will change, I’ll apologise they’ll still call me a piece of shit and still deny that they did anything wrong and they’ll keep doing it the next day. But at least I still have a bedroom and food and maybe they’ll still support me where I can’t financially.

There’s only a few time periods where I can fall asleep and actually stay asleep. It all depends on what’s going on in my life and the things I do leading up to sleep but I typically have a difficult time staying asleep.

These random wake times are tied to things like my depression. For some reason, it won’t let my stay asleep. Anxiety, not eating enough and most important of all, getting beat out my sleep when I was younger. My mom would come into my room early in the morning to hit me. She’d rip the covers off of me and hit me with her hand or some random object. She loved using the kitchen spatula. I got hit for leaving a few dishes in the sink, not cooking rice for her, not washing her coffee mug, not leaving something in sight for her to find, accidentally leaving my phone with me instead of having it on charge downstairs.. it messed my sleep schedule up really bad. This happened on and off from the ages of 11-15. It stopped but the damage has been done. I’m 21 now and the effects are still there.

I take a mixture of magnesium, ashwaganda and melatonin. I typically take more than what’s recommended because I don’t enjoy being awake. It still doesn’t keep me asleep. I play music/binaural beats while in bed, I journal in bed or read, I turn all the lights off, I try to stay off my phone past 10. I do everything under the sun and I still wake up at these random times. I know that the solution is to move out of the environment that I’m in so don’t come up here stating the obvious. That’s what I’m fucking doing. Trying to save up so I can leave. I’m just annoyed and kind of at a loss. My brain is fried from lack of sleep and I feel gross all the time and everything hurts.

## What is Tesoro Ledira?

Tesoro Ledira is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users—especially beginners—participate in financial markets like **crypto, forex, and stocks** without needing deep technical knowledge.

It uses algorithms to analyze market trends in real-time, placing trades on your behalf based on the parameters you set. Think of it like a smart assistant that doesn’t sleep and reacts faster than any human could.

While the creators haven’t gone public (which is pretty common for platforms in this space), the software logic and interface seem closely aligned with other platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**—which suggests they may share the same development roots or tech stack.

This kind of anonymity can raise eyebrows, but so far there’s no evidence of shady behavior or foul play. Transparency could be improved, but the functionality and support do hold up.

It’s how inmates survive .  It’s a canteen where you can buy hygiene and special food items that aren’t served on the cold, terrible trays. It is an isolated ray of sunshine in an inmates world.

* John F. Kennedy



**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1308 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

Pvt. James Seamore and Pvt. Matt Johnson waited outside the negotiation canopy. *Guard duty. It’s always guard duty.* The young Private thought, watching the scene in front of him. He estimated four, no, almost five dozen. The eyes of the natives watched with great interest on the men.

“So, what do you think?”

James looked to his fellow Marine, dumbfounded. “What do I think? You ask that now, of all times?” He went back to scanning the crowd of people.

“Just asking.” Matt shrugged and did the same.

*Sigh,* “Well, I think this is some crock of shit. I mean, boots like us always get guard duty. I wanted to explore, you know? Brave new world, and all that shit.”

“You idiot, that comes later. First, the government gets what they want, then we get what we are given.” The young man said before turning his attention from his brother in arms.

“Besides, I think it would all be worth it in the end and you can do all the exploring that you want…” Matt smiled at one of the natives. A blonde woman, in a crimson silk dress, too revealing to be a proper lady. Unsurprising, considering what else this city is famous for. James noticed this and raised an eyebrow.

“Oh, for fuck’s sake, when I said exploring, I’m not thinking of Conquistadors so get your mind out of the gutter. You don’t even know what these people could have. Plus, you remember what happened to the last guy who got something from that Japanese chick, right?”

He winced at the thought, “Yeah, enough Penile Swabs for a Marine battalion. I get your point. I guess we just have to SITFU for now.”

James thought of something to lighten the mood, but he never got the chance.

“***Haha…HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!***”

Laughter broke from the canopy. Sudden and loud. Both of the Marines wondered who laughed like that.  
  


“Well, that’s some creepy ass laugh, like an alien that just learned how to laugh by mimicking humans. Can you tell who it was?” James asked Matt.

“Beats me, but I can somewhat guess from whom based on that voice… and considering what kind of SOB he is, I don’t even wanna know what makes **him,** of all people, laugh,” Matt replied.

  
Although they may have a hint of whom, they'd best not say anything about it. However, the same can’t be said of the people who are inside the negotiation canopy.

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1310 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

*What in the seven hells has got into him?* Kevan questions as he watches his brother laugh, deeply, like a war drum before battle. His brother, the Shield of Lannisport, the great watcher from Casterly Rock. The most powerful man in all the Seven Kingdoms, if not the world, laughs like their Lord Father once did years ago.

His eyes ventured over to the Lannister Guards behind them, and their faces. Their faces showed **fear**. The Red Cloaks of Casterly Rock are no normal guards; they are true soldiers. Unlike the savages of Clegane’s Keep who are only good for foraging and terrorizing peasants, these men were bred for *war*, trained day in and day out, lived by their sword, spear, and shield, all to protect their liege lords and his family. They are the Lannisters’ answer to the Unsullied of the far east, minus the chopping of their cocks off, of course.

What developed in his strategic mind then we’re the rumors that are going to spread. They raced around, developing into a typhoon. But were halted.

“Ha ha. The Lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep. But your people, my lady… are no sheep. You have shown that much, you and the Captain. And for that, you have my respect.” Lord Tywin methodically clapped.

Kevan raised an eyebrow to this.

“So… you were testing us?”

“Indeed.”

“But why almost throw away this meeting? To gamble on it?”

“To see what you are forged from. When a knight trains from an early youth as a squire, do you have him wear steel? No, he must be forged by fire and steel, hammered into shape on the anvil of war. Because a knight’s experience could be the difference between life and death. Every cut, every bruise, every broken bone he earns molds him. You say that you are not and have no highborn, which for us would mean no knights.”

“But from what I see before me, everyday citizens were bred into warriors. Maybe something more. You do not wear visible armour. Your confidence is your armour, your **words** are your sword. Your **history** has tempered you, burned you, hammered you into what sits before us. To put it simply, your people know their place, and I mean that as a compliment, you know the power that you have, and I can admire it.”

“I am used to being groveled too. **Feared** by my banner man. Because fear keeps them in line. Judging from your letter, I am quite sure that Maester Lorwell had told you about a certain song called “The Rains of Castamere”, no?”

“In a way, I suppose.” Kelly shrugged. “We have other ways of keeping those in line other than fear, but I get what you mean. And yes, Maester Lorwell indeed had told us about the rebellion by your former bannermen, the Reynes and the Tarbecks”, she drank from her glass, “and about the fall of Kings Landing.”

Tywin gave the Maester a glare of disapproval, “I presume he explained everything in **great** detail”, he put emphasis on the word ‘detail’, “as I would have done.” The maester could feel himself trying to sink into the chair.

“He did”, Lorwell was relieved to hear the words come from her lips, “I was eager to hear more, but we did not have time, of course. Maybe another time you could share with me your own 'account' of the event.”

“I would be delighted, my Lady. But for now, we have business to attend to.”

“Very well.”

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1315 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

“It must be a permanent place?”

“Yes”

“But… Castle Golden Keep would be a marvelous place for you to stay. My lady wife, Rosalynd, would be honored to host you there, as would I.” Lord Tyran used all his charm and gracefulness he could muster to convince Kelly to set up the consulate residency in his castle.

“We thank you for the offer, but a consulate building must be a center for diplomacy. Having it in a Lord's castle would make it seem like favoritism to the other regions. Which is why it must be in a separate establishment.”

Tyran was disappointed, but understood her reasoning. “As you say, my lady.”

During the two-hour grace period before Tywin and his people were to be picked up, Kelly took some time to examine the area around the Lion’s Sea Step itself. *More of a mild curiosity,* she told Capt. Richard, but in reality it was for the perfect spot for a consulate building.

Before leaving Washington, she was given the full authority to do so. “*Just don’t go crazy with it, ok*?” The Secretary of State’s words. *Hehehe*

With this in mind, though, she did want the building to have a major impact on the local area itself. And after some investigating, she found the perfect one. Not too far from where they are docked is the city's town square, cobblestoned to the pier, a straight shot you could say. Two old, rundown two-story buildings sat, most likely abandoned, for almost ten to fifteen years or so. The buildings faced west, towards the Sunset Sea. If the buildings could talk, Kelly wanted to hear their story.

The square seemed more like a market, unlike the one on the pier; this one seemed to sell anything other than fish. Like silk, clothes, parchments, animals, books, and food. A few also sold what appeared to be armour as well. *It must be old pieces to be in a normal square. And not at the shop it's made from.*

“There are two old two-story buildings in the town square, not far from here, about a hundred yards or so. They appear to be structurally sound, and they're large enough, at least for our needs now. Do you know about it?”

“Besides that they are old? Not much I know about it, I must say.” Tywin said bluntly, “But, Lord Commander Torren, what do you know of these buildings?” He turned to look at his second cousin. He was eating a slice of bread when all eyes were not on him.

“Oh, those buildings? My predecessor, Lord Commander Marlyn Lannister, shut those buildings down because of an illegal counterfeit coin group. I believe they were called “The Bronze Rings” and ran underneath the two shops above. The “Lioness Cove” and the “Lion's Cliff” were the names. They both were known for their beef and pork pies and decently priced beds. At least that's what the old smallfolk say.”

“Shame really, but now? We find gutter rats sleeping beneath their roofs. They are easy to catch because the places sit on the main cobble road leading up towards Castle Golden Keep. They were both the third and fourth buildings in the city to be connected to the sewer line that comes down from the castle and into the sea. The others are the Golden Sept and I believe the Golden Delight Brothel.”

To Tywin, this was nothing new. Torren spent his time at both the Golden Sept and of course, the Golden Delight Brothel. He just wished Torren didn’t bring it up. “But are they suitable for their uses, Torren?” Tywin presses.

“Forgive me, but I would not know, my Lord. I would say the best course of action would be to have a builder or two take a look. Wouldn't it be right to have them set up shop, just for the buildings to collapse on them.”

“So it could either need some touch-ups or a complete teardown and rebuild?” Kelly questioned the man.

“You would be correct, My Lady. It will depend on what the stonemasons have to say.”

“In that case, you can leave it to us, our Navy has Military Engineers who handle all sorts of construction. They are nicknamed the ‘Seabees’.” Capt. Richard informed them with enthusiasm. “These are tough men and women who can pave away anything thrown at them, it is their job after all. They are onboard the *USS San Antonio* now. With your permission, Lord Tywin and Lord Tyran, of course, we could have them here in half an hour.”

*So your fleet has an entire order of engineers dedicated to construction, for fortifications, camps, and siege engines perhaps, which from the looks of it, also act as a vanguard force, and they are just onboard your ships now? You are prepared for the worst, my lady.* Tywin thought with great interest. As he thought, he sipped this *coffee* that was brought in.

This coffee drink was served hot like tea but different. Made from grounded seeds of an exotic plant of the same name, the taste was bitter, and it had some kind of herbicidal properties that allowed his eyes to keep awake and his mind to stay sharp and focused. Lady Kelly told him that it was one of the staple drinks of her people and he can see why, this is the kind of drink any self-respecting noble would prefer over the intoxicating wine when it comes to doing their duties.

*When we’re finally talking coins, I’m going to make sure that Casterly Rock would have an entire cellar of these coffee seeds.* Tywin mentally noted.

Kelly watched as Tywin leaned over to his brother and whispered amongst themselves for a solid minute. A few nods were shared, a few more glares at her and the Captain.

“Very well, we will allow you to bring these ‘Seabees’ into Lannisport and ‘survey’ the former ‘Lioness Cove’ and 'Lion's Cliff’.” Kelly was glad to hear this, she wanted to express her gratitude. She wasn't given a chance.

“But”, Tywin lifted a hand to let the word hang in the air, “you must allow us to observe your men working on the buildings, so our stonemasons can,” his nostrils flared, “learn your craft. Keep in mind, this would be a simple observation and your men can otherwise do their work unhindered. What say you?”

The Americans looked at one another, almost speaking with their gaze. No harm in letting them just “observe”, right?

“That would be an acceptable proposal. Speaking of observing, there’s one place that we would like to visit, and we would like to ask your permission for it.”

“What is it?”

“We would like to visit the Golden Sept and see the Septon in charge.” Tywin raises his eyebrows. “As you know, Maester Lorwell has told us many things about your people. Among them is the religion that you followed, the Faith of the Seven, and how your city hosts one of the largest places of worship in Westeros, the Septs as your people called it. So we would like to extend our greeting to the priest, the Septon in charge there to clear up some things about our appearance. You see, we have made quite a bit of commotion among your smallfolks, so we would like to prevent any misunderstandings as early as possible.”

“What could be so important to meet with them as soon as possible?”

“Our people have a saying: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. As such, we don’t want to come off as some kind of sorcerers, demons, envoys of the god of death, or even gods themselves, especially not to the believers of the main religion of this land.”

“So you do not want to strike fear into the smallfolk,” Tywin guessed with a raised brow, “But to show them that you come in peace, and to prove that you seek the local Septons' approval, am I not mistaken?”

“Precisely.” *And to minimize the chance of your bitch of a daughter to use them on some hair-brained plot against us.* Kelly added in her mind.

“Hmm…then I shall allow it. We do not want a peasant uprising **or** revolt on our hands.”

“I am pleased to hear it,” Kelly said with a smile, She then turned to one of the Marines behind them. “Can you get me in touch with the Captain of the *USS San Antonio,* please?”

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1325 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

Kelly made her way back inside the canopy “The *San Antonio* will get close enough to launch her Landing Craft, as well as another two from the *USS Makin Island*, they both should be here within the hour.” she said, taking her seat next to the captain, “So, have anything interesting to chat about while I was gone?” She questioned, looking around the table, it appeared they were in a deep discussion about something.

“I was just explaining the concept of diplomatic immunity,” the captain said. “It turns out, it wasn’t a foreign concept for them, as they do communicate with merchant representatives of Free Cities and Summer Isles on almost a regular basis.”

“Yes, my lady.” Kevan answered, “I can still recall a time when Summer Isles’ traders were injured in a brawl with some drunken bannermen of a noble house. The Summer Islanders then refused to trade spices with us for five to six moons until we punished the responsible rabble and sent an envoy to Summer Isles to apologize to them. You can see why treating foreign representatives with respect is also important to us.”

“Ah, that’s good to hear.” Kelly said before thinking to herself. *Note to self, recommend the high brass to look into Summer Isles and to keep an eye on any swan-looking ships docked in this port later on. Those people might turn out to be important trade partners in the future*.

“But, just to be sure we understand, could you explain it, my lady?” Tywin asked her, more for political insight than anything else. As she did, his mind went back into the histories for an example of when it would have been a good idea to have their version of this “Diplomatic Immunity.”

The more he listened, the more examples from history came to mind. Aenys Blackfyre was the major incident that came to mind. Promised safe passage to King’s Landing by Brynden “Bloodraven” Rivers. Only for him to be executed upon his arrival. *If this ‘diplomatic immunity’ concept, at least, the Americans version had come to us a century ago, then Westeros would be a very different place. Yes, very different indeed.*

**Lion’s Sea Step, Meeting, 1400 Hours, Nov 3rd, 2025**

As the discussion went on in length for quite some time, what felt like an hour, at least that was how long it seemed to Tywin in his mind. Learning quite a lot about ‘Earth’s’ geopolitical landscape. *Geopolitical,* another word added to his already extensive vocabulary. The Maester right next to him had been writing almost non-stop, only to take a drink of water, or shake the numbness out of his hand. Understandable, considering that these Americans seem to have extensively modified their Common Tongue, which they referred to as English language after their former liege kingdom, that there are simply too many new words to be recorded by just a single maester.

The other four at the long wooden table had been given their own ‘notebook’ and ‘pen’ to write down questions and answers to their heart's content. Tywin's pen moves as well, not like the Maesters, of course. No, that would be Kevan’s job to do. His brother’s pen moved like a carriage on a frozen lake.

The information coming through his ears flowed like a raging Tumblestone river, or of a broken dam after a harsh rainstorm. Filling, flooding every crevice of his mind. The knowledge seemed almost forbidden in this quantity.

Light shines through the door as a lone Marine comes inside, stopping the discussion. “Sorry to interrupt, Ma’am, but the Seabees are pulling in now. About one hundred and fifty yards away. They're asking where to dock, Ma’am, what should I tell them?”

“Lord Tyran, would it be alright to dock closest to the road that leads to the soon-to-be consulate building?” Kelly asked the man, who was finishing up writing something on his notepad.

“If I understand your description correctly, then there should not be a problem for them to do so in front of the seaside shops. Plenty of space for the docking lines.” He said with a smile, his golden mustache catching the light.

“Very well then, let them know where to dock. We will meet them there.”

“Yes, Ma’am.” The Marine gave a nod and left. Leaving the seven of them alone. Besides the guards, of course.

Kelly began to stand from her seat and stretch. “So, shall we go out and wait for them?” She asked the group, all standing slowly, letting their joints loosen. A few making very faint pops.

“I believe that is a yes, my lady. I am quite curious how you're… ‘Hovercraft’ functions.” Ser Kevan said, popping his back.

I (22F) live with my parents and my little brother (16M). Both my friends and his friends often come over. I hate when my brother’s friends visit because of their poor hygiene. Before coming over, they usually play basketball or other sports, and they arrive all sweaty without taking a shower or changing their clothes. I hate the smell when they are here. That said, my parents have never said anything to my brother about his or his friends’ hygiene.

On the other hand, my friends are all very clean girls. Obviously, they don’t bring the disgusting foot odor that my brother and his friends do. My friends usually go barefoot in our house since they wear sandals and take them off when they come in.

Yesterday, two of my friends came over. Our house was slightly cold, and one of them put her feet on the coffee table in the living room. To me, this is totally normal behavior. However, after they left, my parents warned me that it was very rude for my friend to place her bare feet on the coffee table and told me I need to make sure it doesn’t happen again. They also said they find it rude that my friends walk around barefoot in the house without socks or slippers, and that I should talk to them about their behavior if I want to keep inviting them.

I found this very strange because, in my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with what they did. They are clean, and it’s completely normal to be barefoot. I also don’t see the problem with putting your feet on the coffee table. I think it’s really unfair that my brother has never been warned about his friends’ poor hygiene, while my parents criticize my clean friends for being barefoot.

Chapter 1

After discovering that Kason had been secretly seeing his mistress for three years and was planning to marry her, I decided to leave him and return home for an arranged marriage.

On the first day, I handed the engagement ring he had given me to his mistress.

On the second day, I discarded everything that reminded me of him.

On the third day, I put on my wedding dress and married his arch-rival, Ronan.

From that day forward, Kason and I were no longer connected.

Kason scoffed, thinking I was just throwing a tantrum.

Until he saw the news of my marriage to someone else.

Only then did he panic.

==============================

In the office, the two of them were completely unaware of my presence outside the door.

I poured out the coffee I had made for Kason and left.

Kason had always kissed me with such care, so I had never seen him so passionate before.

Now I knew it was because he had given that side of himself to someone else.

I had thought I could marry for love, but reality had hit me hard.

Numb and disheveled, I wiped away my tears and took a cab back to the mansion.

I'm trying to get to the bottom of my sinus tachycardia episodes, focusing on my caffeine intake 

Basics:

- chocolate junkie (but have cut down drastically)

- used to drink 2 Lungo sized cups daily (65mg of caffeine, 1 at 10am and 2nd around 530-6pm before exercise, total 130mg per day). I've cut this down to literally maybe 2x a week with an occasional ""fun coffee drink""

Episodes

- 1st ER visit this yr: possible tachycardia due to coffee (according to my log I did exercise that day which is my habit). Had my episode 5hrs later, thankfully everything was fine

- 2nd ER visit. Inconclusive because I likely had an anxiety attack. This was just 3 days later after the 1st ER visit. Nothing found but high possibility I drank coffee at 9-10am. Went to the ER around 1-2pm, perhaps 4 hrs after my coffee intake

- 3rd ER visit. Unfortunately there's no evidence I exercised that day, but still possible I had my morning coffee and a late afternoon one. Went to the ER at 11pm which sort of correlates to around the same time as my 1st ~ 5-6hrs later

- after my 3rd ER visit, Ive made an effort to go cold turkey for at least 2 weeks. I've been doing my 2-3x a week intake since

Yesterday I had an episode. Had a latte which apparently has an espresso shot at around 830am. My episode happened at 230pm, around 6hrs later after my intake

My assumption:

I've been drinking coffee twice a day for a long time. Is it possible my body isn't metabolizing it quickly enough anymore? Noticed that the effects only kick in 4-6hrs after my intake

I'm moving to Boston on July 1st (I'll be subletting a room for 2 months) and I'm really looking for a part time job to keep me busy and productive for some time. For some context, I'm a 2nd year Northeastern student who'll be starting in the Fall. Because I attended their Global Scholars Program and suffered with some health issues while abroad in the first semester, I had to come home for a semester long medical leave while I got healthy again. During that time, I got a job at Urban Outfitters for 4 months and took online classes. The reason I wanted to sublet and work during the summer was because I thought that it would help me get ready for the full swing of Uni life after kind of only talking to my family for months (they also moved to Boston for my mom's job and so she could live with her sister). Sorry for oversharing, but I hoped the context would show how important this is to me. Plus it's somewhat of an unusual situation LOL.

I was planning to transfer from my Urban Outfitters over the summer, but my manager there was not the best and would snap constantly at all the workers. I emailed them about transferring me, and they asked for the location and said they would, but didn't follow up. Now that I've quit, I'm kinda worried about what I'll do during the summer - I really want to focus on being my own person and being self sufficient. I have a good amount of job experience and volunteer experience (I've worked 2 summer jobs at Dunkin' and T4 Taiwan on top of UO and have over 80 hrs of volunteer experience) and I'm really looking for places to apply! I'd be happy to stay on after the summer as long as I could clarify my schedule for school. I'd definitely prefer to work at a café, coffee shop, bookstore, or some sort of fashion/retail place because I like working places that make me look forward to work but I also don't know if I can be picky. 

Sorry again for the rant, I'll post my resume below! Please let me know good places to work, how best to score an interview, and how difficult or easy it is to find part time jobs in Boston. Basically I really just don't want to waste money doing nothing in Boston and get really depressed, I want to enjoy living in the city for the first time and stay busy/spoil myself a bit since I pay for anything that isn't school and food mainly. Please help! Thank you! I'll also make sure to write cover letters and follow up in person.

Then when I pulled up, I had to dive into my wallet to look for the stamp card and had didn't get the chance to look at her, but when I looked up and over, her coworker was pretty rude (usually super bubbly and nice to talk to,) and asked for my order which is unusual because the barista I have a crush on is usually the one who comes up to get my order (regular here,) and she just was quietly making the drinks behind her and wouldn't even look at me. Which honestly confused me because we talk all the time. I got the feeling she thought my roommate was my girlfriend so I really badly tried to hint and ask her what time *her girlfriends name* was coming home (I kicked myself after realizing I should of asked ""when is your girlfriend coming home?"")

###Training

I started training 4 weeks after my first-ever HM (1:31:30). I ran that one really conservatively, so I was hoping to go for sub-85 minutes in my next attempt. I averaged 60 km per week over the 12-week training block, using Pfitzinger’s 12/47 HM program. It was way more mileage than before (around 40 km/week), so it seemed intimidating at first. I'm glad to say I didn’t miss a single run during the 12 weeks—but I still faced quite a few difficulties.

First, I’m living in Taiwan for half a year, and I didn’t realize how hot and humid it gets starting in May. My hometown reaches up to a dry 40°C annually, but there’s always some respite at night. That’s not the case here—26°C is the lowest it gets, and I think that really affected me mentally and physically.

Another problem was my nutrition. My stomach just isn’t used to Taiwanese food (quite heavy), so I wasn’t eating enough. I lost about 4–5 kg (10 lbs) during the training block. That might’ve helped a bit with weight, but I think my workouts suffered from the lack of fueling.

Finally, I kind of ruined my taper by climbing Yushan (3,952 m) without cutting down mileage. It wasn’t the hardest hike I’ve done, but I still felt the heaviness in my legs on race day.

###Pre-race

I ran a 10K race 3 weeks out and it went terribly. I was aiming for a 37–38 min finish but ended up with 40:20. The heat and humidity were brutal, and I came into the half marathon pretty demotivated. My plan was to go out at 4:10 min/km pace and see how it went. A PR would’ve made me happy, considering the conditions.

I woke up at 4:00 for the 6:00 start. For breakfast, I had my usual Taiwan race combo: an onigiri, 1–2 bananas, and black coffee. I drank a lot of water and—true to Taiwanese style—scootered to the race. I did 10–15 minutes of slow jogging, strides, and some dynamic stretches. I slightly overdid the hydration and ended up peeing four times in the hour before the start. Still made it to the line by 5:59.


---

###Race

It was 27°C at the start, sunny, and around 80% humidity—just as expected. I paced the start perfectly and tried to keep my heart rate under 175 bpm for the first half. In my last HM, I averaged 174 bpm, which felt a bit too easy, but I didn’t want to blow up this time.

I missed water at the first two aid stations, which worried me, so I decided to walk through all the next ones. I tucked in with two other runners, and we cruised together until around 13 km. That’s when I pushed the pace—my partners were fading. I ran behind a local YouTuber from then until the finish.

At around 17 km, I started falling apart. There was no shade in the last 5 km, and I slowed to 4:30/km and 4:20/km in the 19th and 20th km. Thankfully, the final km had shade again, and I managed a 3:58/km to finish in 1:26:06.


---

###Post-race

I love Taiwanese races. You always get a medal, towel, t-shirt, food, drinks, and gifts—it’s insane. And races are dirt cheap—I paid like 20–30 euros for this one.

I finished 15th out of more than 1,000 people, and my chip time was 1:25:59. I’m really proud of that. I started running 11 months ago, and I could barely complete a 5K. Now, I’ve hit 3 of my 4 original lifetime goals: sub-20 5K, sub-40 10K, and sub-90 HM. My last goal is a sub-3 marathon, which I’m targeting in 17 weeks in Germany. I feel pretty confident about it, expecting way milder weather conditions.

I’ll be traveling a lot in the next 5 weeks, so I’ll try to keep volume around 50–60 km/week. After that, I’ll start the Pfitz 12/55 plan—adding a 5-mile easy run each week to average around 80 km/week. I’m targeting the Dresden Marathon on October 26.

About a month ago, I saw this fluffy orange cat hanging around my apartment door, looking sad and meowing. I thought it was a stray, so I started giving it treats and letting it inside when it was raining. It would curl up on my lap while I did work, purring like a little engine.

I posted it on a local FB group asking if anyone lost a cat, but no one replied. So I kinda just adopted him unofficially.

Then last week, I saw a flyer in the elevator. It was the same cat. Same weird black spot on his nose. My heart dropped.

I messaged the number, and it turns out he belongs to a sweet elderly man who lives on the floor below me. The cat apparently just roams around and he thought it was living its best life but he was also worried sick. I ended up carrying the cat down to him, explaining everything, and I was so embarrassed I almost cried.

Here’s the plot twist: the man was so grateful but also told me I can visit the cat whenever I want because he clearly chose you too. So now, I go down every morning to have coffee with Mr. Whiskers (the cat, not the old man lol) and his owner who has been telling me stories about the building from the 80s. We’ve sort of become friends.

Anyway I accidentally stole a cat but I ended up gaining a friend a daily coffee buddy, and a fluffy lap heater in the mornings.

Nothing is enough, the doctor said, and you will never be happy. I got recommended pills, which I am sad to say I declined. 
 The days go on and I spend them waiting for tomorrow. On the rare occassion I go out with people I feel absolutely nothing. I have met up with a couple of women in the last few months, one night stand after one night stand. 'You are not someone I want to be around more than I have to'. I would have to agree, having to be around myself endlessly. 
 In the mornings I make coffee, read, go to class. Exercise has proven a helpful hand, but i find something lacking in its provisionality . I have tried hobbies and have stuck to drawing and playing guitar. Still, as I grab the pencil, as I pick up the pick, there is nothing I feel towards these passtimes. There are too many Is in this post, and too many Is in my words. 
 I don't know the world, and I am not afraid to say that I'm scared of it. Most days I try to be a kind and loving person, to a fault. often is the case, however that mask shatters and I am left with nothing but a blank expression and inconsderation towards others. This is who I am. And I want more. 
 Tolstoy once wrote something in the vein of those who want more have too much. I daren't agree, for he who merely lives to exists in my mind can not exist to live. That's just the Ego talking. At the same time, I know that what I am doing right now can't be referred to as 'living'. Yet to live, life, is what I want. So much so that I have on occassion tried to end it. And what is life to me? Love, I would have to concede. However, love to me, is but a mere fantasy. 

I have found myself in Japan, studying abroad. The year is coming to a close, and soon I will have to go back. I do not mind this - things are the same wherever. However, i have been mesmerized by a lovely person. Her face and her words do not leave my mind, she is in dreams. We have gone out once or twice, and I could not form words. My heart aches when im around her in equal proportion as when I am not. Have you ever looked at someone and thought to yourself never have I met such purity in the form of a person?
 She does not care for me, and this is plain to see. Yet I find myself clinging onto the hope that I am mistaken. There is a month left, and after that I am afraid that our eyes will never meet again. What then? Do i tell her how i feel beforehand? Do i leave it be because I know it will put an unnecessary strain on her? 
Would I still love her if she were to say yes? Or would I want something more thereafter? ",1,1751165284.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

A lot of divorced, weekend dads live here, so the insights and commentary is HALIROUS! 

We kind of like him, the few times we have met him he's seemed friendly. None of us have met her.

From screaming in the parking lot we have learned she was cheating with what we think was a food delivery guy and he might have been cheating also, but we aren't sure. 

He took the bed and frame out to the curb, set it up, put a 'Free' sign on it. We saw the bed on the curb, so we actually saw it leave in the back of an SUV. 

She wasn't happy about that at extremey high volume, for hours, in the driveway...

She threw his cloths in the dumpster and set them on fire. 

The apartment complex has video showing her make about 6 trips from apartment to dumpster, the set it on fire, but she says it isn't her on the video.

We didn't see her for about a week, so assuming she had to see a judge on that one. 

The manager/grounds keeper comes by for a beer and shows us the videos. 

I've never attributed police with an over-abundance of brains, but not even the cops fell for that. 

One of them took a bunch of furniture out of the apartment, it was a man, but he was at work so we only have theories.

The police only seemed bored on that one.

She has trashed his pickup truck, slashed his tires, broke windows, generally messed it up. 

I learned if all 4 tires are slashed his insurance company would pay for new ones along with windshield, side windows & mirrors. 

The complex gave them a 30 day eviction notice. 

That made her go harder. 

She got people to break into his big home safe. 

Again, complex has cameras showing her and three men going in & out of the garage for about 12 hours, dragging tools back & forth. 

He had removed everything she was looking for when they finally got it open. 

We know this because she was screaming at the police ""It was empty, He stole it first"". 

One guys said, ""She's so crazy I'm surprised I didn't marry her."" He caught me mid drink, I blew beer out my nose. 

Again, police were not amused to see half a dozen nosy guys laughing uncontrollably.

The safe was about 6 foot tall and took a wrecker to get it out of the garage, and it looked like a demolition derby car when they got done with it. 

I went to watch, now know safes aren't all steel, they have concrete in the sides. I classify that as Educational. 

So with about 10 days left on the eviction notice now, her car got towed off. 

Roll back wrecker got it after dark, but no one can read the name on the side.

Police should consider a mobile office post until this eviction/seperation is over... 

Last weekend they were splitting up possessions. She did it at VERY HIGH volume.

The coffee maker, what I think was an air fryer, and several dishes didn't survive it. It looked like a nice air fryer if that's what it was. 

I'm impressed that parts of the coffee maker made it all the way across the parking lot up against the other curb. That's like 60 feet way from where it hit the concrete. 

So tonight we were playing cards (poker night) and hear a big boom after dark, just a few minutes ago... AND... her car is back. 

It's plugged into what we think is his rental car, and that car is pushed up against the garage door frame.

He's taking to police, she's no where to be seen, or more to the point we can't hear her. 

I'm out of chips, so it's pop-tarts, peanuts and beer tonight. Police just look aggravated again.

The manager says the end of the month is the end of their eviction notice days, I'm going to miss the entertainment...

I’m staying in Beijing this week and my loose plans turned out poorly. I would love some company — 

I’m a left-wing politician in a Northern California city and I think connections between the US and China are of paramount importance. I also have always been fascinated by Chinese history and culture. 

So I perhaps over-ambitiously came to China alone with a very humble-yet-improving Chinese language ability. I’ve been in China about a week so far, Beijing for one night, and I will be in the country for almost two months in total. 

In Beijing I took an invite through mutual friends to stay near a university. It was an unfortunate oversight that I can’t enter the campus alone because I am not a student. And I will have a student as my guide and language tutor for just a day or two this week… So I feel a bit locked out of everywhere and I’m considering staying in another district. 

I’m an urbanist; I like walking city streets, riding bikes, taking public transit. I’m comfortable with beer and liquor, but have more of a habit of drinking coffee and reading. I’d be happy just follow someone around and talk in Mandarin, English, or Spanish. Or go to museums and tourist spots. Even any recommendations for where a person like me should go would be nice.

Night Terrors (Or - Jane’s Warning)

December 28, 2025
I am writing this journal to keep better track of my majorly dysfunctional brain. I have recently bought a very nice apartment, so that will be my first entry in my journal. With my doctor now pleased, my name is Johnathan Hansen, and about four months back, I finally decided to give in and rent an apartment (it took about four months for me to actually fulfill my decision, though, sorry parents)and to finally make something of myself. I had saved, hopefully, enough money to rent an apartment for a good time from working at a construction company for 3 years. (I’m 24, went to college for three years, and then got a construction job after that.) I was living with my parents and wanted to finally give them peace. I eventually decided I could pay rent off that money for a decent amount of time. Rent was about $400 a month, and for the space that I got, it was a steal. Because I was raised in California, where a million dollars gets you a shack outside of a much nicer mansion (which costs your entire family tree’s life savings), an apartment costing 400 a month was something you could only experience while inebriated. With the cost in mind, I fully expected a scam. But for 400? Worth it, even all the way out right by Anchorage, Alaska. Anyways, it was a small apartment. A white, two-bed-one-bath, modern and sleek. Now that I write this, I realize it wasn’t actually that small. The layout was bottle-shaped, with the front door leading to a narrow hallway with both bedrooms to each side and a bathroom directly to the left of the front door. The hallway concluded with an average-sized living room space.  I had been warned by  Jane, an old tenant of my new home, that her sleep was odd, interrupted, and confusing. I gave very little thought to this at the time, shrugging it off as a problem exclusive to her. This, however much I had ignored it, along with the lack of other people around, led to extreme unease. Surely a cheap, nice apartment complex would have people, right? That was the first thing. As I pulled up, I opened the door to the main building and began to feel nervous. This place was nice. Very nice. The parking lot was also strangely empty, which didn’t really have any effect on me until I entered the building. As I entered, I noted the size of the room almost immediately. The room was marginally bigger on the inside. Not non-Euclidean, just an interesting style of architecture. I also noticed the peculiar look of the desk clerk. He looked entirely depleted of energy. I mean full-on insomnia. He had a name tag with an overly joyful, small saying and “Sergei” written in extremely shaky handwriting. He was sturdily built. Not athletic, but strong and not at all unhealthy (Other than the obvious lack of sleep). He had black hair in something similar to a comb-over, with a very droopy face and stern, sharp features. His eyes had a distance to them. Everything about him was normal, from his Nike shoes to his red suit. But his eyes. Their magenta haze, just showing a disconsolate euphoria. The unease already existing in my stomach had escalated much further.  His voice was broken, as if he hadn’t had anything to drink in ages. “Sir, I need to see your apartment key to access the lounge.” I had forgotten where I was and clumsily tried to look in my backpack for a key. I told him I didn’t have one yet and needed one to access my apartment. For a little bit of context, the room was extremely nice. Extremely luxurious and modern, with furniture you would expect a heedless millionaire to buy. I thought to myself that maybe they were running a business on the side, because no one could afford this on $400 a month, but I hadn’t read anything or heard anything about it. “Sorry, I don’t have my key yet. Are you the guy I need to get it from? Or do I need to go somewhere else?” The man took a second to respond, unblinking, with eyes locked slightly above my head and to my left, but his face showed nothing. After a long moment, he replied, “I can do it. I just need to verify that you own an apartment. First-last name and middle initial.” I gave it to them. His voice and eyes still lending to my stomach’s state of disarray. He told me how to get to my apartment and gave me my key. As I began walking to my new home, I noticed something out of place. A symbol was inscribed into a tree, a flower with white and yellow dye in it. I remember it as a lotus flower because my girlfriend loved them. It was very shakily drawn, with shocking detail, despite the extremely shaky drawings.. It did make me laugh a little bit. Something that seemed almost as if it was created by a child in a place so luxurious and nearly ominous as here. The rest of the walk was boring. It was maybe a 300-yard walk in a densely wooded area from the main lobby to the apartments, but it seemed to take forever just to get halfway. At the halfway point, the only interesting part of the walk appeared. It was one average-sized tree, the bark peeling away from the cold winter’s vicious teeth, gnawing slowly at it. But what interested me the most was the rope hanging from the top. It was the type of knot a climber would use on a large rock face. It was only about a three-foot-long rope, which confused me because the tree was only 16 or 17 feet tall, and the rope was at the very top of it. I wrote it off and continued walking. The snow just seemed to keep getting taller and deeper, ensnaring my boots more and more the further I trekked down the untouched trail. 
Once I arrived at the apartment (A standalone building, not dislike a cabin), I took the key Sergei had given me out of my now snow-laden pockets, and opened the door. The first thing that hit my senses was the cold. It wasn’t the cold of the outside; it was like someone had put ice in front of a fan and then blown it directly into my face.  Once I wandered deeper into the house, I realized it didn’t exactly match what the listing had shown. It had more windows than what was listed and was much more spacious. The bathroom had a circle etched into the floor, maybe six feet wide and maybe 1-2 inches deep, right in front of the bathtub, which was what you’d expect from a royal family or the white house. Marble and covered in gold outlines. The room itself was black marble with white accents, and it had a very solemn feel to it. The hallway was about the width I had expected, maybe 6 feet wide, with the ceiling about 8 feet tall. As I walked into the living room, I noted that the ceiling increased in height by a moderate amount. It was maybe 12 feet high, much larger than I had expected. The “kitchen” was just an oven below a microwave next to a sink, all at about 90 degrees from an island. Once again, I felt slightly suspicious of the cost, which was almost too good to be true. The furniture was, however, quite modest. Middle class, not higher or lower. There were so many paintings. Almost immediately after seeing the photos, I knew I had to throw almost all of them away. They creeped the shit out of me. It was artistic depictions of gore. Nothing serious, just a king stabbing a jester or a snake eating a gazelle. One stood out, though, because it wasn't violent at all. It was a beautiful rendition of a lotus flower, with intricate curves of the petals and extraordinarily vibrant and ornate colors. Very out of place among the other hideous paintings. Once I got there, the chimney was already burning, and I assumed it was done by a janitor or just a caretaker of the unused apartments. 
December 29, 2025
Last night sucked. I went to sleep at around 11:30 (I write as a pastime and usually stay up late doing requests from friends and family). At some point in the night, I started dreaming. I was lying in my bed, the new one in the apartment, and I heard knocking. Not light tapping on the door, but almost aggressive banging and rapping at windows and walls. A symphonic cacophony of raps, taps, pounds, knocks, every possible noise that could be created from hitting the walls. I was trapped in my bed, incapable of moving anything but my eyes. I had never had any history of sleep paralysis before this and was quite horrified. It just felt so real, but I knew it couldn’t be. I knew it was just a dream, but it felt so much more surreal than all of the other sleep paralysis events that had been described to me by my friend who suffered from it. As I remembered all of this, the knocking stopped, and I felt a freezing chill coming from my room’s doorway. Then, with a harsh and shaking thud, the air stopped flowing into my room. I saw colossal, charred, black fingers wrapped around the doorway. The digits were easily a foot long each, but shriveled and of an abyssal black hue. The second they had firmly grasped the door, I gained the ability to move again, and shut my eyes so tight I thought I was going to pull a muscle in my eyelids. When I opened them, it was bright in my room, sunlight gleaming through the open window of my room. It was impossibly cold, so I lit a flame in the chimney and closed all of the windows. For such a nice home, you’d expect heating, but no. Just a chimney. Every window was open, and I thought I had forgotten to close them after opening them at some point in the night. After that event, I started to think of my girlfriend. I would never admit it to anyone, but that night horrified me. I wanted someone to live with me in the apartment, and I could ask Rose to live with me. I wouldn’t tell her it was because of something that happened to me, of course. She had been looking for a place to live and was living in her parents' house, kinda like me. And since we had only been dating for 4 months, it was not on my mind to invite her to live with me. The previous night made the decision pop into my head, though. Her name was Rose (Her dad is a MAJOR Titanic fan; I am surprised her brother wasn’t named Jack or something), and she was great. She is about 5’1’’, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone’s eyes before. I met her on my break while working on, coincidentally, an apartment complex. I was sitting on a bench, eating a sandwich of just bread and turkey. She sat on the other side of the bench and asked me if that was all I had to eat. I told her yes, and she withdrew a sandwich from a nice-looking purse. The sandwich was considerably better than the one I had made (I ignored the fact that she randomly had a sandwich in her bag; she has her quirks). I ate it heartily, and as I got up to go back to work, she asked for my number. We hit it off from there and went on a few dates. I texted her, offering her a stay at the apartment, and she accepted relatively quickly. This wasn’t exactly shocking, as she had been looking for a way to get closer to me recently. After waiting for a few hours for her to pack her stuff (She didn’t like her parents, so she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible), I started walking back to the main lobby. 
As I exited my house, I was incredibly shocked to realize that there were dozens of footsteps in the snow, entirely encompassing my cabin, and just circling, again and again and again. I followed one trail specifically so I could get an idea of the rest of them. It made 4 laps around my apartment and stopped directly in front of the window of my bedroom. The window was also directly over my bed, so whoever or whatever made those footsteps was staring at me in my sleep. I knew it couldn’t be the same as the knocking from the night. I knew it was intense and surreal, but it wasn’t real life. I have always had some form of dreaming, but rarely nightmares. And when I did, never nearly that bad, but I knew what one was supposed to be like. Yes, it was weird, but I was probably just overreacting. I got rid of the footsteps and jogged back to the main lobby. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about the woods. Nothing really happened; it was a boring jog, but it just felt wrong. When I arrived, Rose still hadn’t arrived, and I waited in the slightly off-putting lobby. Sergei was there, just as terrible-looking as before. I wondered how long it had been since he last slept. 
Rose arrived maybe 20 minutes after I did to the main lobby, luggage (Much more than I brought) on a trolley, packed mostly to the brim. Her hair was very nicely done; either she changed her hairdo or put more effort into this than our previous dates. She was wearing white and gold plaid pajamas and a red hoodie. Rose was completely ignorant of my being there and seemed quite put off by Sergei’s appearance. I doubted I would ever get used to it, but that wasn’t important. She noticed me about a minute after she walked in, mostly due to the fact that I tapped her on the shoulder to even get her attention. She was happy to see me and spun around so fast her arm hit me on the shoulder. She said she was sorry and then hugged me for a good 10 seconds. She told Sergei she was with me, and after I confirmed that, he let her through. He asked me why I hadn’t brought her the first day, and I told him I hadn’t thought about it. “Anything happen during the night? Unruly neighbors? Wildlife in the area give you a spook?” I told him nothing happened, just thought about it this morning. I guess he didn’t have the energy to care anymore, so he just drank something out of a tonic and went back to his computer. 
I showed Rose the way to our cabin (as I will now call it). She asked about the inscription in the trees, and I told her that I didn’t know. I assumed it was just the logo of the company that owned the housing, but I honestly had no clue. I didn’t know much about the place other than it being cheap and nice at the same time. I opened the door, and once again, the wind's cold fingers brushed past me, nipping at my already cold ears and nose. The inside was just as cold as the first time, and all the windows were open. It didn’t appear anything had been taken, but there were puddles in a track to my room leading to my closet. I quickly said I had to clean the place up a little bit and shut the door behind me as I entered my room. I ran to the closet and flung it open, but found nothing but my clothes and a puddle on the floor. I somehow managed to ignore this and told Rose it was just me spilling water on my way to the coffee machine (She believed me, but the sink and coffee machine are right next to each other). She commented on the paintings, the distraught expression of the bard, or the ignoble eyes of the serpent. I told her I would burn the damn things but she told me to just put them in storage or the owners would get mad. I conceded and did as she said. She was right, and the place had given me the chills ever since I got here.
January 1, 2025
That night was rather peaceful. She decided to sleep in the other room but told me she would sleep with me eventually. She had previously had an extremely abusive relationship, where as soon as she slept in the same bed as her ex, he took advantage of her and even hurt her. That wretch was in prison now, but that didn’t change what he did. I told her I understood, and told her to just take her time. I slept peacefully, and to my knowledge, so did she. I woke up to the smell of cinnamon and brown sugar, and when I walked to the kitchen, I saw her making French toast. I asked her when she woke up, and she responded, “I don’t really know. I just kinda realized I was making breakfast.” I thought it odd, but we both quickly wrote it off. I had ordered locks for the windows so that they couldn’t be opened from the outside, and installed them later that morning. While installing the locks on the windows that faced the forested area opposite the main lobby, I noticed what appeared to be a man in a very opulent gray suit and black, fingerless gloves. He stood entirely statically, not a single twitch of a muscle. He was maybe 200 feet out, but I could not make out a single feature of his face. He stood in a tall brush, but not tall enough to cover his face. It just seemed as if his features were distorted but not present. Like a Mr. Potato made out of paint. I chose not to tell Rose, as it would do nothing but scare her. I finished installing the rest of the locks as fast as I could and proceeded to call the front desk. 
It wasn’t Sergei’s voice, but instead a very bubbly voice of a woman. Almost entirely opposite of Sergei’s raspy and depressed voice. “How can I help you?” She asked as if she were a therapist trying to solve my problems. “I saw a man in the woods. He was just staring at my house from the forest, and I’m worried for my safety. Is there any security, or do I call the cops?” She said nothing, the static of the landline growing louder, its angry voice roaring in my ears with growing intensity. She broke the silence, returning the static to a dull hum. “He is not a concern to you. We do have security, and they have been warned. Is he still there now?” I hadn’t checked, but as I did, he was right up against the window, his fingers severely frostbitten and pressed up against the glass. His face didn’t make sense; there wasn’t a face, there weren’t any features, but there was something. He DID have a face, I just couldn’t tell what was what, there was no contour, no edges, no curves, just color that gave way to more color, color giving the perception of depth. Like a great artist who didn’t know how to shade. It was wrong. Luckily, Rose was out shopping and didn’t see the man. As soon as I poked my head out of my room and saw him, he ran off into the woods faster than I could’ve possibly expected. I quickly told the receptionist what I had just seen, and she replied rather quickly, “I’m sorry, sir, but there is no man in a purple suit running around looking into windows. You may be hallucinating, but we have fencing and security near the area. I have told security, but you have nothing to worry about.” I reluctantly told her thank you, and put the drapes down on the windows. The room was much dimmer, but I didn’t mind. The thing that stuck with me was the fact that I never mentioned he was wearing a suit, especially not the fact that it was purple. 
January 2, 2025
When Rose got back with the groceries, she asked why the curtains were down. I told her I had a headache, and the sun reflecting off the snow caused it to worsen. This wasn’t a full lie; I did have a headache by this point, and I didn’t want to scare Rose on the second day here. That night, she actually decided to lie next to me on my bed for a while. She didn’t sleep next to me, but I saw this as a major improvement. Things chilled out for the next week or two, and nothing strange or creepy occurred at all during that time. About a week in, Rose started sleeping next to me. I understood how hard it was for her to trust someone this much, so I felt so appreciated that I was the someone she could trust. 

January 17, 2025
It started on Friday. First, it felt like every ad I got on TV was about being an organ donor, and I actually paid for no ads on most of my streaming services because of this. Next came the sleepwalking. I had set up cameras outside the cabin because of the mishap with the man. They were motion detecting and only turned on when there was movement. It was usually just deer walking by my house, or on one special occasion, an elk. One night, the motion sensors were set off by none other than me. I had gotten up and walked outside, barefoot, in just pajama pants. I stood outside, deadpan into the woods, Unmoving and unblinking for three straight minutes, and then I calmly walked back inside and went back to sleep. I wasn’t at all cold during this time and don’t remember any of it. All I remember was getting up in the middle of the night to piss. This happened two more times, and then I started deadbolting the door at night so that the unconscious me couldn’t go outside at night. The reason wasn’t just so I didn’t go out, but because I heard a voice without any discernible origin the last night I went out. It was indiscernible, but it was saying something.
January 20, 2025
Rose started experiencing nightmares. From what she told me, they weren’t serious, just her watching TV and seeing the people in the paintings that were magically back on the wall frolicking, and stuff like that. At least it wasn’t the dream of me cheating on her (It happened once, and I hope she never has that dream again - nightmare fuel). She bought some striplights and other forms of lighting and less modern furniture to make the extremely luxurious “Cabin” seem more like a real cabin. We saw the northern lights one day; so bright and beautiful, so vibrant and close I thought I could reach out and touch them. I was overwhelmed with joy, realizing life was pretty nice. No parents to tell you what to do, a place of your own, and a loving girlfriend; it was nice. I had gotten a job in the area, and so had Rose. We had more than enough of an income stream and cheap enough housing to live a relatively lavish lifestyle. But it just didn’t feel right. It felt too perfect. The whole 3 weeks I had lived here, I had only seen around 10 other people. There were also the nightmares, and the man that I knew was real, that I knew I didn’t hallucinate. Something was going on. I just didn’t know. 
January 21, 2025
The worst thing yet happened. I had another sleep paralysis event. This time, Rose was with me. I got ready for the worst, but nothing happened. I couldn’t move anything but my eyes, and I was confused when no horrors of the abyssal woods came to haunt my waking dreams. And then, all of a sudden, every single window of the house started rattling. The same symphonic cacophony of rapping, tapping, knocking, and every noise you could get from knocking on a wall. This time, there were the windows. They were being rattled and shaken so aggressively and so quickly that some of the locks were starting to be unscrewed from the window sills. Rose’s expression changed. She was still asleep; she just started making a disgusted face, as if she were looking at putrescent mounds, or something of equal disgust. Suddenly, the knocking stopped, and through the mirror on the wall, I could see the window right above my bed. Through it, I saw vile creatures. Humanoids, mouths all curled up into an impossible smile, the mouth’s gaping open so wide and so deep the head could not possibly have fit the unfathomable depths of the dark grey tissue that was their mouth. They had innumerable extremely long and sharp teeth, along with two fangs, very similar to snakes. The smile seemed to continue for almost the entire circumference of their head, barely not meeting at the back. The flesh of the creatures was a dark gray, with the smallest points frost-bitten to the point of ash, crinkling away at the slightest wind. There were so many, all staring in the window, right at Rose. Their fully bloodshot eyes with yellow pupils and a disgusting bile covering the rest of the putrid aberration only conceivable as their face.. They were quite slender, their neck barely wider than my wrist. All of them were completely unmoving, just staring. Then, they looked in the direction of the front door as I heard the same banging sound, and the sound of the door being slammed open, then shut. Then there was nothing, the moonlight faded away entirely, giving way to sunlight, the creatures vanishing, whatever came into the house gone, the entire time, I knew I was awake. The cameras caught motion, but they were all just black screens. None of them caught anything.
As soon as I woke up, I looked to Rose. She wasn’t sleeping. I quickly jumped out of my bed, rushing to the living room. She was in the kitchen, cooking eggs. “Hey, honey, you’re awake! It’s almost 1:00, I was starting to get worried!” I responded, in an attempt to calm my own nerves, “Just tired, I guess. How’d you sleep?” She put some eggs onto a plate before responding, “It was pretty good. I had a nightmare, though, and it was actually about you.” She then explained to me the nightmare, which kind of frightened me. As a kid, I always wanted to dream with my friends, so I could spend more time with them. But when the dream is actually a nightmare, and it terrifies your girlfriend? I told her I had an almost identical nightmare, and then I heard a knock at the door.
January 22, 2025
The person knocking was a man in a very nice black suit with a tie with the same lotus depiction as in my house. He had some aspect of the haziness and distance to his eyes as Sergei did, but he still seemed of good health and calm mind. His voice was that of a diffident salesman, seeming a little hesitant to speak with me. After gaining his composure, he asked to speak to me in private. He was selling me a heater and told me he was speaking in private because he recognized Rose as one of the higher-ups at the company he works for. I had never actually asked about Rose’s job, but if she sold heaters, I guess that would have been a waste of my time. He told me the space heater was gas-powered and that the apartment complex had a line running under all of the cabins, and that he could hook the heater up quite easily, and that it would just take some time. I asked for the price, and he said the apartment complex would pay 40% of it, and when the original price was only 200, I had to buy it. The cabin was cold enough as it was, and something that could heat the entire place easily for 120$ was worth it. I told him I was interested and bought it. I had to pay early, so I paid him just before we left. I gave him cash, which I was surprised he accepted. 
He left and came back in a very nice pickup truck about two hours later, dressed less fashionably than before, in a normal, grey coat, and beige, denim pants, with gloves and a hat. He and I pulled the heater out of the back of the truck, setting it on the ground just below my window. I had noticed there weren’t tracks this time, so I was consoled a little more into recognizing that experience as a dream. It was also at this point that I realized I didn’t know his name. I asked him, and he said he wasn’t comfortable with giving his name out, but said he worked for a company called Priapus. I thought it odd that a salesman, whose goal is to be personable enough to sell something to a stranger, wasn’t comfortable with giving out their name, but forgive and forget. I was no longer needed, so I went inside to spend some time with Rose. It was already about 7 PM at this point, and that was around the time I watched TV with Rose. I’m a major Invincible fan, and she had never seen it, so we had been watching that lately. The man left about two hours later, having hooked up the heater to the ventilation of the extremely modern little cabin in the woods.
January 23, 2025
Rose just got home from a doctor's appointment, and now we know she needs some type of sleep mask. Unbeknownst to me, Rose has had sleep issues for a while now. I had known about her going to the doctor's appointment, but was told it was just a routine checkup. I guess it could be, but I didn’t remember her sleep being bad (other than the nightmares) or having problems when she woke up. But I guess if the doctor thought it necessary, I would have to agree. The heater does its job well, although the cabin seems just the smallest amount foggy, just barely noticeable even if you’re looking as intently as possible. It didn’t bother me at all, and Rose didn’t seem to notice. It helped that the fog was only really there at night as well. No more frozen entrances to the abode. 
January 26, 2025
Feels like forever since I touched this notebook, but I have so much to write about. I actually dedicated time today just to write. First off, Rose is pregnant. I only found out about this ~4 hours ago, and I can say I am pretty excited. I have always wanted kids, and now I can finally have one. Just hope it’s a boy. Secondly, I am getting suspicious. The rent is so incredibly cheap, the accommodations are so incredibly luxurious, yet there is almost no one here. Just recently, someone moved out. The crazy thing is, I never saw the moving truck. I am pretty sure I am one of the only people living here. There were only three other cabins with lights on last night, which I refuse to believe. Something has to be happening to give another source of income. I looked up the company that owns the place, and they do NOTHING except run the apartments. With all of the luxurious furniture, the discount to almost any new furniture I buy, they have to be running so deep in the red that not even Toys-R-Us could match the bankruptcy this place should be reaching. I know I should be worrying more about the kid and preparing for them, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is going wrong. I’ve been so tired lately, coffee barely affects me. That can’t be normal. It may just be the other job I picked up, but that is just another two hours to my day. I don’t even work at that worksite, I just oversee it. I should not be this tired, yet here I am, 7 PM, feeling like I’ve pulled a full-nighter three times in a row. Rose seems completely normal, though. Maybe I just gave myself a placebo somehow. I’m not taking any new meds, but maybe the old ones have expired? Let me check. No. The meds are completely fine. I don’t know what is going on, but I’ll figure it out. Away from those semantics, I also got a raise, a 30% pay increase. That is such a massive ascent, I am almost in the triple digits for my salary. That’s another thing. Until recently, I had been getting paid per hour per job. Now, I have a salary (Which up until recently was my average income from the past two years) that had only existed for 2 weeks, and it just gained $21,000? My luck is only achievable by divine intervention. Maybe god just really likes me? I don’t know anymore. I’ll think about it until I write next. I still have one more thing to get off my chest, however. Rose has been acting a little distant lately. You’d think the pregnancy would make us closer, but she is less talkative than before, a little less cuddly. She is about 5’1, with beautiful shoulder-length, bright blonde hair, just barely not white. She got the tips of her hair dyed pink a while ago, but that has since faded, and her hair is back to normal. She has a completely unblemished face (which makes sense with the amount of skincare products on our bathroom sink) and the only violet colored eyes I have ever seen. I was very surprised when I noticed them for the first time. I had just never seen that hue in someone’s eyes before. She isn’t the strongest woman I’ve ever seen, but she isn’t a pushover. Now that that’s done, I am going to go to sleep. I’ll write more tomorrow.
January 28, 2025
The faceless guy came back, and so did the nightmares. Everything is so much worse now. I barely sleep at all, and when I do sleep, the nightmares make sure it doesn’t rest. The monsters get hungrier, more intent in their gazes, their gaping mouths screaming in a cacophonic melody, devoid of any soul or life, just husks made for nothing but a purpose. Every time I dream of them, their eyes get just a little bit hungrier, their smiles get a little darker, the endless abyss of their throats tries harder and harder to convince me into their gnashing maw. They seem stronger every time I see them, too. Their grip on the window getting just that little bit stronger, their gnashing teeth getting a little louder, their gazes scaring me more and more.

I have several of these pieces that are 12”+ wide and around 30” long. I had some ideas for a coffee table, and I wondered if I could put some side by side in a design. So basically instead of one long one the length of the table, it would be 3 or 4 turned 90 degrees side-by-side to create the length of the table. 

Looking around I haven’t seen anything like that, so I’m wondering if it will turn out badly and that’s why no one else seems to be doing that. 

Anyone seen anything like that?  Any other suggestions as to what to do with them to get the length of a table?  Or should I just make something else?",2,1751164478.0,epoxy,0,1.0,False

Anyways, I (29f) recently had a blood panel done. CBC and some hormone stuff, thru LabCorp so I got to look at the results firsthand. Two things were flagged. My carbon dioxide levels were moderately low, and my ""LDL Chol Calc (NIH)"" levels were borderline high. The assistant called me to let me know everything was fine and no follow up app was req'd. 

I bulldozed into Google and AI because I like to investigate things myself. I found that these two things linked in with one another could ""possibly"" be tied in to kidney or thyroid disorders. I do have concerns with thyroid running in certain family members. And I have a long history of bladder/kidney probs since I was a kid. I was a bedwetter until age 12/13 and over the years starting in my 20s I've dealt with pylonephrits (sp?) almost once a year. I've been safe from it this year so far (knock on wood).

I'm not trying to get ahead of myself, but has anyone dealt with anything similar? I'm wondering if I should advocate for myself and opt for a deeper dive in blood specific testing for thyroid and kidney functioning. 

To add** I frequently deal with consistently sore/tight legs/feet that just feel super heavy all the time. Almost like one would when they work out intensely, or would be coming down with the flu or something. The thing is, I never get a temperature and I don't work out. I'm also at a good weight of 130 pounds and 5 foot 4. Also, I drink plenty of water because I live here in AZ so you need to stay hydrated. Even when I drink a lot, my urine output is not much at all. It's never bloody or cloudy though. The only time I produce a what seems like a normal amt of urine is when I drink some sort of duretic like coffee/tea. Not only that, but I've had this ongoing rash that comes and goes for the last maybe year and a half-2 years now. On the nape of my neck it was terrible, the Dr. Gave me steroid cream and it helped that area, but the itch is continuing now travelling up my scalp which is really strange, and it's not dandruff. In the last month I've  developed itchy blistering fingers also (I know there's a term for that). The itchiness is always the most intense in the AM and I've tried silk pillowcases, different laundry detergents, etc. trust me I've tried EVERYTHING to try and make changes to help my skin. But so far the itching has been localized to those areas this far. To sum that up, I've peeked into kidney stuff and I've seen mentioned that since it causes inflammation it can reflect as itchy ness on the skin too so I was thinking hmmmmm 🤔. I just thought it was interesting because the Dr didn't think the rash was eczema. So just put a bandaid on it, gave me steroid cream, said she'd refer to dermatogoly and never put in the referral. 

Okay ANYWAYS this was terribly long but I would love to hear annnnnyyyy feedback. Whether you all think I might be crazy, or I might be into something and should investigate further. This will probably be posted similarly in the kidney area of reddit also to get more insight there too.

Thank you all, I love you so much if you got to the end of this.♥️

1ln3y8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ln3y8p/it_bothers_me_when_people_complain_about_having/,It bothers me when people complain about having no money because they waste their paycheck living outside of their means.,"Okay, I’m not one of those “poor people shouldn’t have anything nice” types and I know we are all just trying to get by. But seriously, if you can’t afford your electric bill or rent, why are you ordering DoorDash every day and spending $90 to get your nails done every other week? 


You can do things that make you happy, but be crafty and do it in a way that doesn’t put you in the red. Instead of expensive hair appointments, learn how to cut and color your hair at home. Don’t buy a luxury car if you can’t afford the payment, get something simple and reliable instead. Buy store brand groceries and make your fun coffee at home. Learn how to paint your own nails or use press ons. Skip the pricy delivery fees and pick up your own groceries and meals (heavy on this one). Look for free or inexpensive events to spend your time at instead of blowing your cash at the bar, a rave, or a concert every weekend. Utilize the resources at your local library. And for heaven’s sake, stop buying cigarettes, alcohol, tattoos, electronics, luxury makeup and designer clothing, etc. if it will cause you to not be able to put dinner on the table. I do not sympathize with you if you have the means to provide for yourself but throw away your paycheck on unnecessary luxuries all the time. 


We all want to splurge and spoil ourselves once in a while and I respect that, just be wise about it and keep it at a minimum if it will cause you to be agonizing over finances or begging others for money, especially if you have kids. ",87,1751164378.0,rant,74,0.81,False

The longest I have gone without a drink on my own besides when I was pregnant with my kids. Obviously didn’t drink at all because I had an important reason not to..it was because it wasn’t just me I had a baby growing inside of me so I would never do that pregnant. I did think about it today because my kids father is here at my house tonight having himself some drinks and playing video games with the kids but I just know how I DON’T want to feel tomorrow especially after how far I’ve come so IWNDWYT. It’s not worth it. I’ll get my sleep and get up and get my iced coffee early in the morning and be productive. Happy Saturday 🩷 ,20,1751164325.0,stopdrinking,5,1.0,False
1ln3x2d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ln3x2d,Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow: surprisingly good for frozen dairy dessert.  Giant Eagle Coffee Chip: Not bad,"My dad wanted a chocolate marshmallow ice cream in a larger size. I didn’t think there would be one as I only knew of Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food in the pint. But I was surprised to find exactly what my dad wanted in Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow. It was the only one I saw in this flavor in 48 oz. Yes it’s frozen dairy dessert, and I didn’t expect much. Yes the container was in fact lighter than the Giant Eagle store brand Coffee Chip which I also got. But honestly, I thought it was pretty good. 

##Turkey Hill Chocolate Marshmallow 

* Price: Giant Eagle retail $6.58, sale $3.28. Walmart retails $3.52
* Chocolate ice cream: Turkey Hill does a Dutch chocolate ice cream. I haven’t had it, but I could taste a bit of extra cocoa. Some chocolate ice creams have very weak taste, but this isn’t that. But there was also an infusion of marshmallow taste from the swirl for an overall sweeter milk chocolate. 
* Marshmallow swirl: Wow there was a lot. It’s thick and gooey kind of like a concentrated, sticky Cool Whip marshmallow, with a bit of similar taste. An enjoyable texture. I got generous bites of only the swirl. 
* Texture: for a frozen dairy dessert I honestly expected much worse, like Breyers frozen dairy dessert’s odd, freeze dried marshmallow texture. But actually it was pretty much the same as the Giant Eagle ice cream (not frozen dairy dessert), except with a bit more air. The texture and mouth feel is otherwise the same. For frozen dairy dessert, this is one of the better ones. 

***RATING: 7.5/10. Yes this ice cream has some artificial tastes. But the textures and price point is hard to beat. The chocolate flavor and marshmallow flavor likely aren’t as rich tasting or extraordinary as Phish Food. But I think this is a satisfying, economy buy for a family affair. I would get it again. 

##Giant Eagle Coffee Chip 

* Coffee ice cream: On first bite, I was impressed by a roasted coffee flavor that reminded me of Private Selection Coffee ice cream, but with less depth and dimension. Honestly, a little weak. But it did taste like actual coffee brew. The more I ate though, the less I liked it. Could taste some marshmallow-y flavors that didn’t match the flavor profile. 
* Dark chocolate chips: a similar story of being impressed with the chips at first. The right balance between a thin and a thick chip for an extra crunchy texture. Sometimes, a little too thick. Also, yes, I could taste the semisweet flavor. I enjoyed the hint of espresso. But, the more I ate the more I began to taste like a caramel flavor. It’s a common story with chocolate chips. 

***RATING: 6.5/10. This ice cream isn’t bad. Actually, some of the marshmallow flavors was like Chocolate Marshmallow. The difference is, I don’t think this ice cream was supposed to taste that way. I wish that the roasted coffee flavor and the dark chocolate remained consistent in flavor because I did like the combination. The textures are also good here. This ice cream appeared popular and low in stock at my Giant Eagle. It does have its positives. But I probably wouldn’t get it again. If you’re interested in this ice cream, by all means. The price is right and the flavors are generally ok. 

##Which would I get again 

Definitely Chocolate Marshmallow. Didn’t think I’d like a frozen dairy dessert over an ice cream, but here we are. I do think my dad liked this one too as he said it was pretty good. While Chocolate Marshmallow probably isn’t going to impress the sensitive palate, I think a kid or the average ice cream consumer would enjoy the uniquely textured, generous sized marshmallow swirl. 

##Similar ice creams

* Ben and Jerry’s Phish Food - chocolate and marshmallow swirl. The GOAT
* Private Selection Coffee - a more roasted, complex coffee flavor (no mix ins)
* Homemade Mocha Chunk - coffee and chocolate chip. Similar all around, slightly better. ",0,1751164261.0,icecream,4,0.5,False
