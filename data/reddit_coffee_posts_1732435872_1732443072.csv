Maybe now isn't the time, and yet - life waits for no one.

It looks like we'll start off the day with some light rain, so make sure to grab your umbrella before heading out. The rain is expected to taper off by mid-morning, leaving behind cloudy skies and cooler temperatures. Don't let the rain dampen your spirits though, it's the perfect excuse to cozy up with a cup of coffee and a good book.

As we move into the afternoon, the clouds should start to break up, allowing some sunshine to peek through. This will bring warmer temperatures and a more pleasant afternoon for any outdoor activities you have planned. Maybe it's a good time to take a leisurely stroll on the beach or enjoy a refreshing swim in the ocean.

By the evening, the skies should clear up completely, giving way to a beautiful sunset. It will be a great opportunity to unwind and relax after a day of mixed weather.

1gynkyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cernercorporation/comments/1gynkyr/interview_with_np_about_the_failed_introduction/,Interview with NP about the failed introduction of Cerner Millennium in Sweden,"(Article and translation below)

Background by me: I'm an MD in VGR, a large (by Swedish standards) 1.8 million people region under one healthcare administration. Cerner and Millennium won a public purchasing round for a new EMR in 2016, and has since then been ""adapted"" by Cerner (and later Oracle) to fit swedish healthcare. I have been at a few of those meetings over the years, but hasn't been otherwise involved. In part because the writing sort of was on the wall.. Millennium was introduced in a *sub-region* with one hospital and a number of PCPs last week, as part of a staggered introduction spanning 18 months or so. It failed spectacularily, and after four days it was retracted, and decision was made to roll back to the old system (which in itself took days). I don't work in the sub-region that introduced Millennium, so I didn't see all this first hand. 

This is an article in one of Sweden's major news outlets. More info in the factbox at the bottom of the article.

**The district nurse on the Millennium days: ""Toughest week of my life""**

**The four days with the record system Millennium became a trauma for healthcare in Borås.
Now the staff wonder how the regional management could imagine taking such risks with them and the patients?
- You almost hope that it's fraud or bribery behind it, says district nurse Alexander Westberg.**

November 12, 2024 has become like a common mark in the soul of the healthcare workers in Borås and the surrounding area. The experience of having started the record system Millennium is likened to a trauma.

- What really happened to us? I see it as the toughest work week of my life. In some ways the toughest week of my life, overall, says Alexander Westberg.

He is a district nurse at the health center in Trandared. A workplace that felt good and received high marks in the patient questionnaires over the years. But then came Tuesday, November 12.

For Alexander, there was a long lead-up to that day. Already in 2018, he was recruited as one of the coaches for the region's new EMR system. An American tech giant had just won the contract and the regional director at the time was happy with the deal.

- I feel secure that we have chosen a system that meets the needs of health care, Ann-Sofi Lodin said in September 2018.

The health center in Trandared has had high marks in the patient questionnaires. But on November 12, everything collapsed. ""In one hour, we went from working great, to being at the bottom of all parameters,"" says Alexander Westberg.

Alexander Westberg had no reason to doubt that, then. On the contrary, he was excited.

- I went to meetings and was really willing to learn. But nothing ever came. It was postponed and postponed.

In the years that have passed, the system has been given the name everyone now knows - Millennium - and the coaches have received information about developments at regular intervals. But it was only this fall that they were called for the first time to a concrete training week.

- I was at Regionens hus all week 37 and all professional categories were to be trained under the same roof, in the same corridors. Finally we were going to learn this! But almost nothing worked in the practice environment and the training material didn't match what little was on the screens.

Alexander Westberg alerted his superiors about the shortcomings and wondered how it would actually be possible to start up, without any education worthy of the name? The alarm went all the way up the organization, unheeded.

- The only answer that circulated was that hopefully the manufacturer works with a focus on the sharp environment. On November 12, it would look different.

The doctor Constantinos Ktoris looks in and finds out what we are talking about.

- I can't bear to say anything, he sighs. In other words, sorry, but Millennium is just a huge... turd.

He laughs at his own choice of words. A little embarrassed, but still not. How does a district doctor with quality responsibility end up there?

They both came to work early on Tuesday when Millennium started up. Everyone at Trandared did, at least 15 minutes. Despite the warning flags, they say they were determined to carry out the launch. There was even some tense anticipation embedded in the November darkness as they drank coffee together.

Then 7 o'clock struck and the health center opened its doors. The plan was to be able to handle a quarter of the normal patient flow, because a new system - even if it's good - always involves a change. But it wasn't good.

- We stood there and felt that we could not accomplish anything. During the days we used the Millennium, we never got above ten percent of our normal capacity. Rather five, says Alexander Westberg.

He starts Millennium on his computer and then talks about the clumsy system that requires you to always open an extra virtual desktop every time you log in. The window where you identify yourself is therefore often hidden and hard to find. On top of this, the system hung incessantly, locking workplace after workplace.

- We had to use paper and pencil. A command as simple as ctrl-alt-delete on the keyboard cannot be used in Millennium. We called support and got no help. We talked to ""Floor-walkers"", but it was like talking to a wall.

""Floor-walkers"" are Millennium manufacturer Oracle's staff who were available as an extra support function when the journal systems were replaced. But Alexander sighs.

- During these days, I got more help from the comment field in Borås Tidning's live feed.

No one knows how many patients were harmed by the non-functioning care in those days, but those who worked are noticeably burdened by the experience. Alexander Westberg talks about a betrayal from above towards the employees, which in turn became a betrayal towards the patients.

- In one hour, we went at this health center from working great, to being at the bottom of all parameters. It is a great sadness.

A week later, the Millennium project has been forced to take a break .

- The introduction did not turn out as we imagined and now we are making sure to find out what has happened, said the chairman of the regional board, the social democrat Helén Eliasson, in connection with the complete reversal.

In Trandared, the health center has gone back to its old systems and is working more than ever.

- Everything wasn't perfect before, but now it's like a dream, says Alexander.

You got power from escaping the Millennium?

- Yes, partly that and then we had a lot to catch up on, it was like a smorgasbord of patients. Lots to do and everyone felt it was good to be able to do things again.

But the health center still has to deal with Millennium's shortcomings. The samples that were sent in to the lab just before and during the start of the Millennium are now returned without an address.

- They just land without a destination. We have no idea whose samples it is.

Alexander Westberg does not understand how those in charge could push through the start of Millennium despite the fact that the system was so unfinished and that so many - as he puts it - ""had shouted out loud"" about the shortcomings.

- The crazy thing is, when you look back on last week, it's so absurd that you have a hard time understanding what you yourself felt and thought. One almost hopes that there is fraud or bribery behind it. It's at that level, that you hope so, because it's so unreal.

The only thing that worked during the Millennium Days was the collegiality on the floor, he says.

- We could laugh at the misery. And now we have enormous cohesion throughout the region. It doesn't matter if you are an IT technician, senior physician, care assistant or district nurse. Man only: ""Were you with the twelfth?"" If the answer is yes, we have a bond.

The management of Millennium in the Västra Götaland region has received the criticism in this text, but has not returned with a comment. The manufacturer Oracle has not responded to DN's questions since Monday 11 November.

**FACTBOX**

This is the Millennium

● Millennium is a healthcare information system where all information about a patient must be collected in one and the same place. The system will replace around 30 existing systems within the Västra Götaland region, VGR.

● Similar platforms are underway across the country. Region Skåne and VGR have chosen the same main supplier – American Oracle.

● First out in West Sweden were the southern parts of the region, with Södra Älvsborg Hospital in Borås as the largest individual player. It was commissioned at 05.30 on the morning of 12 November.

● Three days later, on Friday 15 November, the regional director Håkan Sandahl announced that the introduction was paused.

● Several investigations are ongoing regarding Millennium. The Swedish Medicines Agency opened one in connection with the start of operations, and the Regional Board appointed an external investigation a week later. Several notifications have been made to the Work Environment Agency, the Ombudsman for Justice, the Privacy Protection Authority and the Inspectorate for Care and Care, Ivo.",1,1732442327.0,cernercorporation,0,1.0,False
1gynkmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gynkmg/my_brother_33m_drunkenly_confessed_to_me_23f_that/,My brother (33M) drunkenly confessed to me (23F) that he thinks I'm selfish for not caring for my family (not even sure if this is the reason),"Some context: We live in Asia so we have a culture of drinking to do business (this is relevant later.) My brother worked in banking for about 10 years before he suddenly decided he no longer wanted to do banking and instead switched to being a personal trainer/ fitness as that's his passion. His one-decade working in banking has left him with a bad habit of loving drinking. So even though he is in a different field, he still stuck to his old habit of drinking till he passed out drunk. There have been multiple occasions where he was so drunk that I had to come to pick him up on my motorbike at 1 or 2 AM. Note that he is a big dude at 84kg (185 lbs) and I am a small girl at 53kg (116 lbs). Driving him home in the dead of the night was frightening as we could get attacked and he would frail around being so drunk. If he wasn't so drunk and could call a cab home, I would still have to come get him before our house to pay for the cab and then help him up the stairs to his room. This is a common occurrence, at least 4-5 times a month.

On to the story. Today, after we drank quite a bit after our cousin's birthday, my brother got a call from a past co-worker/ best friend (when he was in banking) that he was near my cousin's house so come have a drink. This is not the first time he went for a second round of drinking while already being drunk. I protested, saying that he was no longer in banking so no need to entertain this idea. He said that I wouldn't understand, since he's the middle man connecting him and another person. I told him that he could do whatever with his life, just not to get so drunk that he couldn't call a cab home, that I had to come to get him (this literally happened 2 days before). I emphasized this 2-3 more times because I was frustrated. He then told me that he honestly thinks I am selfish. This all happened while I walked him to the location to meet that friend. After we arrived and I saw that he sat down safely, I went home. 

More context for the reason as to why he might think I am selfish. I am quite career-oriented so I don't care for my family on the small scale details as he does. He would make coffee for everyone. He would buy me food from time to time. I appreciate him doing that but that still doesn't justify why I am considered selfish. I know my flaws but the thing he made me do is actually life-threatening. He once got into a fight with someone while drunk and strangers (men) had to interfere before it got bloody. I was there but I couldn't do anything because I was so small compared to him and the other dude (who punched him) was even bigger. I was even called ungrateful by him because I didn't thank him for getting me one free personal training session (even though I didn't ask him to). 

Sure, I am not that aware of the small gestures in daily life but I was there when it mattered. I know that and am constantly trying to improve it. But to have him call me selfish and ungrateful hurts so much. Both my parents and I have raised this problem before where his drunkenness has caused trouble for my family but it never changes. He would stop doing it for 1-2 months then repeat. I honestly don't know what to do. I am so tired of this situation. It's been ongoing for 2+ years. 

Any advice on how to make him realize the severity of this situation? It's so severe that I am even hesitant to work anywhere on in my city as I can't leave him to my old parents. We have talked in all types of manners to him already. I understand that he is very stressed from being pressed by my parents for the last 2 years for changing from a lucrative career to PT without telling them. But he was living off of them rent-free, food-free so I feel like it was justified for them to be so paranoid of his life when he was not working and drinking a lot. He got a job now but that was after he and my father got into a heated argument about his job (another entirely different story). 

Again, any advice to improve this situation is much appreciated. Thank you so much.

TLDR: My drunk brother told me that I'm selfish because I don't care that much for my family in our daily lives while he has multiple times had me drive him home passed out drunk. ",4,1732442286.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Let me first say this, my MIL is a wonderful and helpful woman. I truly won the MIL lottery.

That being said: she’s annoying me by doing absolutely nothing wrong.

My husband and I aren’t from the same country and currently live in a third one, so his mother and my mother both have to come to us (mine will be here at the end of the week and his arrived a little over a week ago). So there are some cultural differences going on and my brain is already tired enough without having to also process my second language (she speaks English, but the 3 of us tend to mix both language quite a bit as it’s easiest for us).

So, what is she doing? She’s too helpful and it makes me feel bad, even though I know I shouldn’t and she reminds me all the time not to be. Then, she just lacks a sense of personal space. I’ll be making us all coffee in the morning or cooking and she’ll basically be attached at my hip and just sooooooooo close. There’s no malice or anything in it and she’s always ready to be put to work whether it be laundry, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, you name it.

I’m so thankful, but also just so on edge.

I’m just ready for my own mom to get here, I suppose.

1gynft8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bath/comments/1gynft8/what_john_cleese_taught_me_about_creativity/,What John Cleese taught me about creativity,"*John Cleese* is a comedian, actor, writer and producer. His many achievements include being a founding member of the iconic comedy troupe *Monty Python* and co-writing and staring in *Fawlty Towers*. And, of course, switching on the Bath Christmas lights. His book, *Creativity: A short and cheerful guide*, provides a glimpse into the mind of this creative genius.

Here’s one story *John* shares. *If I wrote a sketch by myself in the evening, I'd often get stuck, and would sit there at my little desk, cudgeling my brains. Eventually I'd give up and go to bed. In the morning I’d wake up and make myself a cup of coffee. Then I'd drift over to the desk. Almost immediately, the solution to the problem I'd been wrestling with the previous evening became quite obvious to me! So obvious that I couldn't really understand why I hadn't spotted it the night before. But I hadn't.*

*John Cleese* said, *Learning from something or someone you admire is not stealing.* So, I have permission to share a few of his ideas.

# Creativity is a skill

>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating. - *John Cleese*

Creativity isn’t an innate talent but a skill that can be developed with practice and the right mindset. It’s accessible to everyone, not just *creative types*.

When young, I had no idea I could be creative. *Maths* was my thing. Now, I love building tools for colleagues, designing apps and writing. Creativity is a skill I’ve learned.

# Open and closed modes

>The open mode is a relaxed, expansive and playful state of mind that is essential for creative problem solving. The closed mode is more linear, logical and focused. This is good for execution but bad for generating ideas. - *John Cleese*

For creativity, it important to make time and space to enter the open mode.

Daily walks along my local canal and river provide space for me to come up with ideas.

# Embrace playfulness

>The most creative people have this childlike facility to play. - *John Cleese*

Playfulness is a key ingredient in fostering creativity. Approaching problems with a sense of humour and curiosity often leads to innovative solutions.

I had an idea to repurpose the dried-out body of a frog I found in my garden. I placed the frog in a cup, peering over the edge, on a colleague’s desk. My colleague became aware of something staring at him. Naturally, he assumed it was plastic. Then he realised it wasn’t. Play was a big part of our office culture.

# Accept uncertainty

>Nothing will stop you from being creative so effectively as the fear of making a mistake. - *John Cleese*

Creativity involves embracing uncertainty and resisting the urge to jump to conclusions. Staying with problems longer can lead to more original ideas. Risk and failure are part of the creative process.

I try to accept that there is little I directly control in life. I can control my attitude and the actions I take, but not whether this leads to a successful outcome. However, as the common refrain has it, *The harder I work, the luckier I get.*

# Subconscious mind

>We don't know where we get our ideas from. What we do know is that we do not get them from our laptops. - *John Cleese*

Often, the best ideas emerge when the conscious mind takes a break. Sleep on problems or take a step back to let the subconscious work on solutions.

When my older brother was studying for *A Levels*, he played recordings of textbooks while he was asleep, on the basis it would sink in over night. He went on to get a degree, undertake a doctorate then became a professor. So, maybe, it worked.

Is there anywhere that can teach me intermediate to advanced latte art and how to take my espresso drinks to the next level?

I understand Portola has some lessons but I’ve heard that they are very very basic. 

What I’m looking for is something like a weekend half day class or maybe even someone who’s down to teach me. Happy to pay or can also exchange basic-intermediate surfing lessons or any level of AWS / Cloud technology lessons. I know this is niche, but maybe there’s a redditor out there who’s a barista looking to switch to a role working in tech :)

They were good but I kind of felt the flavors hadn’t opened up fully. It’s hard to explain but there was a minor minor roast flavor in the finish, like bitterness. 

Anyway,
I stored this coffees in my coffee tubes which has a valve to allow the beans to degass. So it should be fine to leave them there for the next week to try and compare. 

For those of you who have opened a bag of manhattan at week 6-8. Have you compared them to how the beans tasted at week 3?

The potential for adverse effects from this choice did not even occur to me bc of all the crap I regularly put my body through 🫠 but did I find out!

About an hour after I developed terrible stomach cramps from all the spice and vinegar in the sauce. I couldn’t stand straight, and I got to the point where I was laying on the floor shaking and crawling to get around. Could not get up to get pepto bismal, drink water, scoop the litter box, nor top off their food bowls for the night. Gross stuff ahead -  I started puking everything out, but bc I felt so paralyzed by the cramps I unfortunately did not make it to the toilet, so I puked all over my floor. As that is happening, I just feel worse and worse; I’m dehydrated and in pain with a pile of puke that I can’t clean. I felt so ill that there were a few moments where I thought it was curtains for me. I was so stressed about my cats getting into the puke and just generally felt terrible about their litter box and food situation, and I live alone so there’s no one who can help me with them. 

It just got me thinking, going through this with cats was stressful enough - with a small child, impossible! Ideally if I had a kid I’d be married with a supportive partner, but so many people end up trapped with unsupportive pieces of shit. What if the person I married and procreated with was sitting on his ass playing video games, telling me I’m exaggerating, or worse, demanding that I still fulfill whatever needs he has? A million times worse than going through this alone. And through all of this there is a small child who needs to be parented-and maybe I’m doing it completely alone if the relationship also doesn’t work out . And maybe we got food poisoning instead and the kid is also violently ill! How tf do u cope? 

It’s been especially stressful because one of my cats is currently passing a kidney stone, and I need to give him his pain killer twice a day. I couldn’t do it - he’s not good at taking medication and I don’t have the physical strength to make him take it. He’s also not getting better despite treatment (eating prescribed food to help dissolve the crystal) and there’s a chance that I may have to go to the emergency vet this week to have him sedated and get the stone removed. If I don’t get better, what am I going to do? I could ask a friend for this huge favor, but it’s just a lot. 

So there’s all of this on top of the obvious, routine considerations: what kind of world am I bringing the kid into? Is this going to be financially feasible? Am I going to project my traumas and be a toxic parent? Also not to mention, the physical toll pregnancy takes on your body. Dealing with constant nausea and acid reflux- after this experience I just can’t imagine it. Side note, but it made me think of a former colleague of mine whose pregnancy was so tough she ended up with a broken rib that she couldn’t have fixed until she gave birth. It was a horrible chain of events from her being asthmatic and catching covid 3 times, to having a huge ass baby in like the 93rd percentile while she herself is pretty small.

I've always been a coffee lover, but my mornings were marred by the struggle with my clunky, uncomfortable mug. One day, I decided to dive into the world of ergonomic coffee mugs, and boy, was I in for a revelation! Let me share my journey, and perhaps you'll find your perfect sip too.
  
  
## The Awakening: My Mug Misery

I remember the days when my morning routine was a battle against my old coffee mug. It was a classic, you know, the kind that looks good on a shelf but is a total nightmare in practice. First off, it was like holding a hot potato. Seriously, I’d take a sip, and my fingers would feel like they were about to burst into flames. I mean, who thought ceramic could get that hot? 

Then there were the spills. Oh boy, the spills! I can’t tell you how many times I’d be halfway through my morning scroll on my phone, only to accidentally knock it over. Coffee everywhere! My cat, Mr. Whiskers, would look at me like I was the biggest klutz on the planet. And let’s not even talk about the insulation. My coffee would go from scalding hot to lukewarm in what felt like seconds. I’d be left sipping a sad, tepid brew that tasted more like regret than the rich, bold flavor I craved.

It was a mug misery, really. I often found myself daydreaming about a mug that could keep my coffee hot, fit comfortably in my hand, and maybe even come with a built-in spill guard. Is that too much to ask?

## Ergonomics 101: What's All the Fuss About?

Ergonomics is a fancy word that sounds like it belongs in a science lab, but it’s really about making things comfortable and easy to use. Imagine trying to write with a pencil that’s too short or a chair that feels like it was designed for a giant. Not fun, right? Well, that’s where ergonomics comes in. It’s all about designing tools and spaces that fit our bodies and help us do things better.

Now, let’s talk about coffee mugs. You might think, “It’s just a mug!” But hold on! An ergonomic coffee mug is designed to fit perfectly in your hand, making it easier to hold and sip from. Picture this: you’re half-asleep in the morning, and you grab a mug that’s too heavy or has a weird handle. You spill coffee everywhere, and suddenly, your day starts off with a mess. Not cool!

With an ergonomic mug, the handle is shaped just right, so you can grip it comfortably without straining your fingers. Plus, the weight is balanced, so you won’t feel like you’re lifting a dumbbell with your morning brew. It’s all about making that first sip of coffee a delightful experience instead of a clumsy disaster. So, next time you reach for your mug, think about how ergonomics can change your morning routine for the better!

## The Hunt Begins: Features I Never Knew I Needed

I never thought finding the perfect coffee mug would turn into a mini-adventure, but here we are! As I started my quest for an ergonomic coffee mug, I quickly realized there were features I never knew I needed. First off, let’s talk about weight. Who knew that a mug could feel like a dumbbell? I picked up a few that felt like they were made of lead. I mean, I just want to sip my coffee, not lift weights before breakfast!

Then there’s the handle design. Oh boy, some of those handles were so tiny, I felt like I was trying to hold a pencil instead of a mug. I found one that had a nice, wide grip, and let me tell you, it felt like a warm hug for my hand. It’s amazing how something so simple can make such a difference. 

Material was another surprise. I thought all mugs were created equal, but nope! Some were made of stainless steel, while others were ceramic. The insulation was key too; I wanted my coffee to stay hot, not lukewarm by the time I got to the last sip. I considered a few brands, like the Yeti Rambler and the Contigo Autoseal, both of which had great reviews. Who knew a mug could be so complicated? But hey, if it means a better morning routine, I’m all in!

## The Test Drive: Hands-On with My Top Picks

I was super excited to finally put my top ergonomic coffee mug picks to the test. I mean, who wouldn’t want to sip their morning brew in style and comfort? I gathered a few contenders: the sleek “Comfort Grip,” the quirky “Twist & Sip,” and the classic “Café Pro.” Each had its own vibe, and I was ready to dive in.

First up was the Comfort Grip. Wow! It felt like it was made just for my hand. The soft-touch material was a game changer. I could hold it for ages without feeling like I was lifting weights. But, here’s the kicker: it didn’t keep my coffee hot for long. I chatted with a barista who said, “It’s all about the insulation, my friend.” So true!

Next, I tried the Twist & Sip. This one had a fun design, and I loved the twist lid. No spills! But, I found it a bit tricky to clean. I mean, who wants to wrestle with a mug after a long day? 

Finally, the Café Pro. Classic and sturdy, it kept my coffee warm for hours. But, it felt a bit heavy. I asked a fellow coffee enthusiast, and they said, “Sometimes, you gotta choose between style and substance.” Ain’t that the truth? Each mug had its charm, but I was still on the hunt for the perfect sip!

## The Game Changer: My New Morning Companion

I finally found my perfect coffee mug, and let me tell you, it’s been a total game changer! This isn’t just any mug; it’s an ergonomic wonder that feels like it was made just for me. The first time I held it, I thought, “Wow, this is what I’ve been missing!” The handle fits my hand like a glove, and I no longer have to awkwardly grip a mug that feels like it’s trying to escape my grasp.

From the first sip, I noticed a difference. The way the mug is designed means I can enjoy my coffee without worrying about spills. You know that moment when you take a sip and suddenly realize you’ve dribbled coffee down your shirt? Yeah, that’s a thing of the past! Plus, the temperature stays just right. No more burning my tongue or letting my coffee go cold before I finish it. 

But here’s the kicker: I’ve found myself savoring my mornings more. I take a moment to breathe, enjoy the aroma, and really appreciate that first sip. It’s like my mug has turned my chaotic mornings into a mini ritual. Who knew a simple mug could bring so much joy? And honestly, I think my plants are happier too. They get the leftover sips, and they seem to thrive on my coffee’s magic!

## The Ultimate Guide: Tips for Finding Your Perfect Mug

Finding the perfect ergonomic coffee mug can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, but trust me, it’s worth the effort! First off, let’s talk about budgeting. You don’t need to break the bank to find a great mug. Set a budget that feels comfortable for you. I once splurged on a fancy mug that promised to change my life. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Sometimes, a simple design can be just as effective. 

Next, prioritize the features that matter most to you. Do you want a handle that feels like it was made for your hand? Or maybe a lid that keeps your coffee warm for hours? Think about how you drink your coffee. I realized I needed a mug that wouldn’t spill when I accidentally knocked it over while reaching for my phone. 

Also, consider your personal preferences. Are you a minimalist who loves sleek designs, or do you prefer something colorful and quirky? I once had a mug with a cat on it that made me smile every morning. It’s all about what makes you happy!

So, take your time, explore different options, and don’t hesitate to try a few before settling on your ultimate mug. Happy sipping!

## Conclusions
  
  
After my eye-opening journey, I've become a firm believer in the power of a well-designed coffee mug. It's not just a vessel for our favorite brew; it's a tool that can enhance our morning experience. So, coffee lovers, I urge you: don't settle for a mug that's merely 'good enough'.

I’ve tried everything over the counter. Sleepy time teas, warm milk, and other odd things my mom recommended. I can’t sleep. I typically fall asleep around 4am but i have to force myself to. Even then I’m waking up every hour until about 7am. I do have a flex work schedule (thank goodness) so i typically sleep 4am to 10:30am. But tbh this is hurting my work, i like to be ahead and not behind schedule. I used to work 10:30 to 6:30 but now im pulling an 11:30 to 5:30. I do work from home a lot more but still.
Now my real irritation is my boyfriend. He is constantly making comments about how I’m sleeping to much. He sleeps 12am-9am roughly. Today for example I woke up at 11:30 and he was upset because he wanted to go get coffee (he can’t get up without me but will typically chill around the bedroom until
I’m up) my family also Just tells me take melatonin or drink tea. I am so exhausted and i would love to sleep. Idk I’m desperate at this point.

After that I didn’t speak to him again and I proceeded to date - he reached out to me last night with this message.

This might seem an arc from an overly cliched romance anime, but I (16M) actually got teamed up with my crush (15/16F she never told me the year) to work on a project for a Christmas Craft Fair. Both of us are slight outcasts, I have mild ASD, she has ADHD, but that also means we both have a creative streak, which helps for the craft fair project. We live on opposite side of the outskirts of my town, she's closer to the next town tho, so she's never in my town execpt for the school we go to.

Tbh, I'm pretty good at socialising with her on every topic, but only when we're in class working on the project or chatting over snapchat, if it's any other place or time, I'm useless. She has quite a tightly knit friend group, and I never made any attempts to say anything to her as I'm deathly afraid of doing something to annoy her, in this case, interrupting her, usually with a completely different topic. So I usually just end up standing at a wall opposite where they’re sitting, which is the worst thing to do, I know.

I'm thinking of taking it a step further on the day of the craft fair by asking her out to get some coffee or soup as the day of the fair, school's out at 13:10. I have no idea how she'll react, any encouragement?",2,1732439177.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I've been struggling with arranging furniture in my living room for ages because it has multiple doorways, and I finally cracked the code! I thought I'd share my experience and some practical tips that worked wonders for me.

First off, I totally get the frustration. Having lots of doors can make furniture placement feel like solving a puzzle. But here's what I've learned: it's all about creating clear pathways while maximizing the usable space.

The game-changer for me was starting with the largest piece first - the sofa. I recently got this amazing modular sofa from [https://athometouch.com/sofa] that's perfect for awkward spaces. The best part? You can rearrange it whenever you want!

Here are some tricks that really worked for me:

1. Map out traffic patterns first
I drew a simple floor plan and marked the natural walking paths between doors. This helped me see where NOT to put furniture.

2. Use floating furniture arrangements
Instead of pushing everything against the walls (which I used to do), I created a conversation area in the middle of the room. Game changer!

3. Go vertical
When floor space is limited, think up! Wall-mounted shelves and tall bookcases saved my life.

4. Multi-functional pieces are your friends
I got rid of my bulky coffee table and replaced it with two ottoman cubes that can serve as extra seating when needed.

5. Consider scale
This was huge for me - I realized my old furniture was too big. Switching to more appropriately sized pieces made a massive difference. Speaking of which, if you're in the market for a new sofa, check out these perfectly sized options here: [https://athometouch.com/sofa]

6. Create zones
Even with multiple doors, I managed to create distinct areas for different activities - a reading nook, TV watching space, and a small work area.

The biggest lesson I learned? Don't be afraid to experiment! What worked for me was taking photos of different arrangements and living with each setup for a few days before making final decisions.

Hope these tips help someone else dealing with the same challenge! Let me know if you have any questions - I'd love to help out with specific situations.

Oh, and pro tip: get furniture sliders. They're cheap and will save your back when you're trying different arrangements!",1,1732438444.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I could barely afford my car payment, let alone gas in the car and the stuff I need to survive. 


For reference, I was an inspector (yes lmao I know the jokes about inspectors). I recently got fired from a coffee shop job and I was curious about anyone in any norcal unions or even private companies looking to hire. 


Also, I'm torn between a few trades. When I was in high school I really wanted to be a pipeline welder and have a big family with land and all that jazz. But as of rn I don't have the means to afford trade school and I have no experience as a welder besides terrible beads and penetration on garage projects.

1gymle4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/1gymle4/reflections_on_lebanon_war_and_the_future/,"Reflections on Lebanon, War, and the Future ","This is a goodbye letter to all of you. I’ve been very active here throughout this war, but I just can’t take it anymore. This has completely drained me, both mentally and physically.

I’ve stopped focusing on my work. I’ve stopped caring about what I eat, how much I smoke, or how many coffees I drink. All I do is sit at home, glued to the news, responding to people on Reddit in the hope of sharing a new perspective. But none of it seems to matter. We’re still stuck with two divided subreddits, two divided realities.

I still prefer this one, of course, but I don’t always agree with everyone here and that’s okay. I still hope that one day we can unite. I dream of a future where we are one country, one people, with one shared destiny and one subreddit. 

What I can’t stand about the other subreddit is how it makes me feel like some kind of zio bot just because I advocate for peace. What I can’t stand about this subreddit is the way so much hatred blinds people from admitting the truth, like yesterday, which was nothing less than a massacre that killed and injured many as they sleep at 4am, to eliminate just one target and it was false intel in the end. Haydar is still alive, innocent civilians died. 

And no, I don’t believe that Israel is a hero for “saving us” from Hezb. Israel might be like chemotherapy, but chemo doesn’t only kill the cancer, it destroys the healthy cells too. It’s like killing someone to save them from the snake wrapped around their neck.

I’ve imagined the fall of Hezb in many ways, but never like this. 
Never at this cost. Many here feel safe, but I don’t. Even though I’ve left my house in Ain el Remmaneh and moved to Achrafieh, supposedly the safest area in Beirut, I still don’t feel safe. My house doesn’t feel safe. I’m still haunted by the bomb at 4 a.m. yesterday that shook me to my core.

Btw no, I’m not Ouwet if that’s what you’re wondering. My entire family is, if that makes some of you feel better. But I believed in “kelon ya3ne kelon.” I believed in change. I really thought we could build something new. But maybe that was just a naive fantasy.

I had so much hope for this country, but every time I try to stand, Lebanon drags me back down. I’m exhausted. I feel like I’m choking and breaking. I can’t take it anymore.

I can’t normalize the sound of bombs. I can’t normalize the constant fear for my loved ones. I can’t bear the thought of more lives lost, more homes destroyed, more streets erased. Even if the buildings survive the blast, the vibrations and the aftermath will destroy them eventually.

I think about climate change. I think about the chemicals in the air, the damage to our soil, the harm to our health. Even when this war ends, and it will eventually, I won’t feel safe eating our vegetables or breathing our air. I can’t shake the fear of what comes next, of earthquakes or disasters fueled by all this destruction. What they’ve done to the south will affect Israel too. We share the same ecosystem.

Now to the Israelis reading this, I want to clarify a few things one last time: 

Google October 17 revolution We didn’t just protest against Hezb, we protested against the entire government. But when the cost became the risk of another civil war, we lost hope.

In 1975, when most Lebanese tried to stop the PLO from firing rockets, it led to a civil war that lasted for years and still haunts us to this day. Why is it always the Lebanese who pay the price, no matter which path they choose?

For those so quick to score a point and mention the Cairo Accords, Lebanon was pressured into signing them. The agreement, meant to temporarily address Palestinian refugees, instead fueled tensions and divisions, leading to the civil war.

We didn’t stop Hezb from firing rockets because unarmed civilians can’t fight a militia armed to the teeth. If you expect us to die trying, I expect something from you too. 

End the settlements. End the occupation. Jail bibi, not just for what he’s done in Gaza and Lebanon, but for ignoring the warnings before October 7 and for trying to block investigations now. He’s no saint. One day, you’ll see that.

Stop giving extremist militias a reason to exist. Only then can we hope to live in peace.

Yesterday, after the 4am strike that killed so many in a densely populated area, someone commented on my post, saying, “You know Hezb also sends us rockets at 6 am and terrorizes people. That comment broke me. It admitted what no one wants to say: both sides are acting in the same lunatic way, and only the innocent is paying the price. 

The difference is, my Lebanese army has nothing to do with this war, and yet they’re still dying.

Yes, Hezb and Hamas will eventually fall. But will Israel be safe? Your main issue was Iran funding these groups. You could’ve ended that fund without destroying so many lives, homes, and cities. Your other issue is Palestine. A two-state solution or any solution could finally put an end to this. Settlements, wars, and past / future occupations will only breed more hate, and hate will create new organizations. This is how it works. The PLO ended, and here we are today, unfortunately. 

To my fellow Lebanese, please don’t let hatred blind you to your brothers and sisters. Keep your discussions calm. Focus on learning, not just winning arguments.

I dream of better days. I dream of a secular Lebanon where we can all live together, finally, in peace Elie, Michel, Mostafa, Omar, and Ali. 
And if we were as fortunate as France and Germany, Japan and the US, and if both sides were willing to put in the effort, David, Isaac, and Noa could be our friendly neighbors.

And if that day comes, I’ll return. But for now, I need a break. 
Thank you I’ve learned a lot during this time from all of you. You’ve definitely enriched my life and offered me new perspectives. 
Stay safe everyone. 🙏 ",20,1732438095.0,lebanon,9,0.95,False

From time to time lumalabas kami to do things, therapy na rin namin ang magkita-kita kasi ang hirap ng buhay (iba-iba kami ng workplace, meron sa province, meron sa manila etc) 

Etong si friend, very private sa life she rarely post on her socmeds and small lang din ang circle nya kumbaga pili lang ang kinakaibigan nya at isa na kami don tapos sobrang energetic nya palagi di mo aakalaing private ferson pala si accla. In short, introvert sya sa socmeds, extrovert in real life.

Eto na, her bday came (aug 20), kaso a day after (aug 21) na namin sya nabati sa gc. Honestly, sobrang busy ko rin kasi nung araw ng bday nya kaya nakalimutan kong bumati (hindi ko lang alam yung reason ng ibang friends namin) yung isang friend ko sabi nya akala nya raw ang bday nya is 21 pa. Nag-sorry kami sa gc then ang sabi nya okay lang daw naiintindihan nya raw na naging busy kami pero sinabi nya sa amin na  naghintay sya kahit hanggang 11:59 pm baka sakali raw na may bumati pero wala daw talaga bumati sa kanya kahit isa sa amin. We already said sorry sa gc and she reassured na okay lang daw yon wala raw problema at okay lang daw sya. And then I thought okay na kasi sabi nya okay na eh. 

Here's the problem: november na at malapit na magdecember pero hanggang ngayon hindi pa rin sya nagpaparamdam samin. Ang dami naming chika sa gc pero kahit kailan di na ulit sya nagreply, sya unang nagrereply dati, sya yung madalas maingay sa gc namin. Niyaya namin sya one time to have coffee kapag uwi nya from manila pero tinatamad daw sya, never sya humindi sa mga aya namin kundi ngayon lang. Tipong kahit kagagaling nya sa sakit or kahit pagod na pagod sya from work she never misses a meet-up. Tapos ngayon pag nag-ppm ako sa kanya, isang tanong at isang sagot na lang sya. Nagpopost sya minsan ng story nya sa fb pero kahit minsan di na sya nagreply sa gc namin. 

Sa tingin nyo, yung nakalimutan namin ang bday nya  ang reason kung bakit di na sya ulit nagpaparamdam sa amin? Kung bakit biglang cold na sya sa amin? Sa tingin nyo ba kinacut-off nya na kami? Kung oo, hindi ba masyadong mababaw yung dahilan nya na yon para itapon na lang yung years ng mga pinagsamahan namin? At kung oo man ulit ang sagot, sorry pero naiinis lang ako kasi sana hindi nya na lang sinabi na okay lang kesa gantong hindi na sya nagpaparamdam. 

Ano bang dapat naming gawin? Eh di nga namin alam kung kailan sya umuuwi ng province, parents nya nasa abroad, yung kuya nya nasa barko, tita nya lang ang kasama nya sa bahay (province) at wala kaming contact sa tita nya kasi ang sungit nun. Di rin naman namin alam yung place nya sa manila (sabi nya before, lumipat daw sya ng condo di nya inespecify saan) di rin namin kilala kung sino mga friends nya sa manila.

1gymiyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1gymiyo/what_is_netanyahu_waiting_for_the_ball_is_in_his/,What is netanyahu waiting for? The ball is in his court regarding Lebanon,"Lebanon in coordination with Hezbollah has time after time agreed to implementing 1701.  

US mediator Amos Hochstein visited Lebanon last week and even stayed overnight for lengthy negotiations and said those negotiations were positive (side note: he even went to starbucks to get coffee and Lebanese didn't let him pay for it). He met with Berri (speaks for hezbollah), Mikati, even met with the commander of the Lebanese armed forces as well as Samir Geagea the leader of the opposition who constantly has called for full disarmament of hezbollah (something probably most Lebanese now agree on after what they dragged us into).   

After that, he went straight to Tel Aviv, met with Israeli officials. Then straight back to washington without a press briefing.   

Lebanon agreed to the ceasefire negotiations, and he stayed for 2 days to iron out all details. The ceasefire deal itself isn't available but many speculate it involves 1701 but this time UNIFIL will specifically consist of french & german troops (not sure if more as well) with stronger oversight abilities. It also involves proper funding for our armed forces to be able to stop any hezbollah attempt at arming back up. However, what all Lebanese agree on is that the deal should not allow what netanyahu wants which is ""full rights to launch any attack on Lebanon when it has any suspicion for hezbollah activities"" because this can be strongly abused and removes our sovereignty in its entirety. We know Israel is targeting hezbollah and its infrastructure, however we also know their intelligence isn't fool proof as they've targeted the lebanese army itself at times and even killed countless civil defense members in their own stations.    

However, netanyahu seems not to agree to a ceasefire, why is that? Is it because he wants the war to continue for his own political gains? Is it because he's waiting for Trump so he doesn't give Biden the victiry of accomolishing a ceasefire? For the record, most Lebanese want Trump as well because he's harsher on Iran/Hezb.

First, let me thank you for this amazing community filled with helpful guides and advice.

I recently purchased a Bialetti Venus 4-cup moka pot along with a bag of Perfetto Moka Nocciola coffee. The results have been quite satisfying—the aroma is incredible (though I suspect it’s artificially added), and the coffee itself is relatively sweet without any harsh bitterness. I usually dilute it with water to make an americano-style drink.

Encouraged by these results, I decided to explore specialty coffee and purchased a 100% Arabica from Nuevo Segovia. I specifically requested it to be ground for a moka pot, and the grind size seems comparable to the Perfetto Moka. The aroma is fantastic, especially since it was roasted just two days ago. However, I’ve encountered some challenges while brewing it, such as:

* The coffee tastes sour.
* The coffee tastes bitter.
* It’s both sour and bitter.
* It sometimes tastes burnt.
* The brewing flow is inconsistent—it occasionally stops for a second, then resumes, accompanied by a clicking noise (likely from the safety valve).

For context, I don’t tamp the coffee. I simply tap the basket a few times on the side and gently on the counter to settle the grounds. I’ve tried brewing with both boiling water and room-temperature water. Here’s my current process:

* When using room-temperature water, I start brewing on a medium-high heat setting (5 out of 9 on my induction stove) and lower it to 3.5 once the coffee starts flowing.
* I remove the pot as soon as I anticipate the sputtering phase and pour the coffee immediately into a cup.

I’m unsure about the roast level of the coffee (dark, medium, or light), but the beans are a brownish color. I can upload some photos if needed.

Any advice to improve my results would be greatly appreciated!",3,1732437667.0,mokapot,6,1.0,False

Not even a pound lost since January. I saw a specialist who was really helpful and gave me all the information on PCOS etc. 

I’m on Metformin 500mg 3x a day, and have a history of binge eating disorder (but am mostly recovered now), I am also on Amitriptyline for my migraines. I also have coeliac so I don’t eat gluten. 

My breakfasts recently have been green yogurt with berries and low calorie jelly, and a protein powder with almond milk and decaf coffee. It’s a tasty breakfast. But I really struggle with the rest of the day. I feel my eating disorder has given me permanent food noise and I just constantly CRAVE chocolate and crisps. I go to the gym 3x a week for weight training and a bit of cardio - but even this has felt hard to do since having my coil out. I don’t want to go back on hormones, they mess me up. 

Please can someone give me advice on what may help! I’m miserable and need to lose weight. And tips for the mental side of it and the food side I would really appreciate!

I will start off by saying me (20f) and my roommate (21f) have lived together since august with 2 other girls our age. We’ve been pretty close for the most part, going out to eat, having meals together, shopping, coffee dates, etc. I have loved spending time with her, but there have been a few things she’s done that, while small in the moment, have reached their tipping point for me. 

I want to start by saying my roommate lived in this apartment for 1 year before I moved in, and even lived in my current room. (Important detail for later) 

First off, she got out of a relationship before we even met, and he now has a new girlfriend. Since I have met her, she completely berates the new girlfriend (they have never met before, the new gf probably doesn’t even know about her) calling her ugly and saying hateful things about her appearance, and saying that her ex will never find anyone like her. (We have all probably talked shit on an exes new partner once or twice, not really that big of a deal) but she will continuously talk about how she would go back to him. Hating the new gf who did nothing wrong, but wanting the mentally abusive ex bf back.. right. Also has repeatedly told me unprompted how she isn’t a girls girl. There was one time when we were leaving the apartment together and a girl in passing gave her a dirty look because she opened the door while she was coming in I guess. My roommate proceeded to call her an ugly bitch to her face. Completely out of line and embarrassing for me to say the least. 

Secondly, when I first moved in, she would always ask when/if my boyfriend would be coming over, and then if I said he was, she would hang out in the living room with nothing but a bra and shorts on. Again, not completely out of the ordinary, just something I observed. 

I have also previously made a post about how she will buy things for the apartment without asking everyone if they are willing to split or just buy their own, and then demanding everyone pays their share. Even had us all pay $5 each for something and then admitted to me that it actually wasn’t that much. 

She kinda always has a snarky attitude with me but Ive kinda accepted thats the way she is. Not really a deal breaker, we all have our moments and bad days. 

A few months ago, I got a kitten. The night I brought her home, I had her in my lap on the couch while I was watching tv, when my roommate snatched her off of me saying “she doesn’t like you”. Maybe a joke, ok, I went to my room without saying anything. My boyfriend got my cat back from her and brought her to me, and then we could hear my roommate go into her room and slam the door shut. Since then she would always just go into my room, most of the time after my cat had just finished playing and was taking a nap, and try to get her wound up again. I asked her if she would not do that, because she had just had the zoomies and had finally went to sleep. She again, went back to her room and slammed the door. 

My kinda last straw was when, a couple of days ago, my boyfriend told me he loved me for the first time. After he left, I told her because I was so happy and I wanted to share that moment with her since I saw her as my friend and I was just bursting with joy. Instead, she just said “he never has?” To which I told her no. She then said “weird”. Completely just disregarded how happy I was and ruined it. 

Also, when this happened, she was on the couch eating. I went to go to my room and my cat ran out the door into the living room where my roommate was sitting. My roommate likes my cat so I wasn’t really in a rush to get her and put her back in my room. I will accept fault here, because I don’t like when my cat is with me while im eating because she wont leave me alone and tries to get my food. So, my roommate grabbed her and took her back to my room but only cracked the door. For some reason my door will swing back open when it’s cracked, likely due to the apartment being built at an angle. So when i went to shut the door all the way, my cat ran back out to the living room. My roommate was PISSED with me. This is why I said it’s important to remember that my roommate was living in that room all last year. She KNOWS how the door is yet did not shut it all the way and was mad at ME. I tried to go and shut it for her because I knew she didn’t want to be bothered and was met with attitude from her. 

She texted me after like nothing was wrong and i just gave her 1 word answers. Haven’t talked to her or seen her since. The situation in of itself isn’t that deep but she’s been like this since we started living together. I don’t plan to burn this bridge or confront her but I would like the time to get over it before talking to her again to prevent further resentment. 

I think in the end it all boils down to the fact that she doesn’t think before she talks to people, just doesn’t care about anyone but herself, and the fact that she’s hurt and lonely and can’t stand to see someone in love like she once was. I understand that it’s hard, but as her friend, I would also want to see her happy, even if I wasn’t.

Hello!
I (25M) have been dating a girl (23F) I met on tinder who lives 40 minutes away from my parents house since August of this year, and we made the relationship official on October 8. The first months, from August to September were really nice and I fell in love with her every day more and more, but since October and November (this month) we had a couple of episodes where she felt disrespected, upset and sad.
She said to me the first days that she wanted a serious relationship where her and I would get married and have a family together. 
The big episodes that bring me here today, are that:
-First, we were walking down the street just chilling and laughing at both of us and everything, and I said ""oh you got a dirty mouth"" randomly and that night she got pissed and almost left my apartment where we were about to have a night together, making me cry and begged her to stay with me, which she did.
- Then another day, we were at one of my friends birthday party (which was the first time I introduced her to my friends) and we were playing table football, she kept on doing a strong shot to which another of my friends said (like if we were on a tournament) that she wasn't supposed to do that, but she kept on doing it so a female friend of the birthday boy said ""she's deaf she can't hear you"", and that night she said that she felt disrespected and that I should have said something to the other girl, like if I had allowed the other girl to harm her, where instead I just ignored that girl who isn't even my friend, and I just called that other girl stupid when my gf and I had already left the party. 
- On our month anniversary, I went to pick her to her job with a bus (I didn't have the car available) 20km away from me (12 miles), and she gave me a bag with candies and playdough (because we saw an Instagram reel with a couple making cute sculptures with it). We had a wonderful day and night, we went to a night club and there I bought her some flowers that an old lady was selling over there. The next day, she left my apartment disappointed and sad because I didn't give her anything, and saying that I only bought those flowers for her because I thought the lady selling them was hardworking at a nightclub at 2am (which I do recall saying that, but it wasn't the main reason), and that I didn't give them to her on her hand, but instead I left them on the table we were leaving our coats. The next time I saw her, I gave her a jar filled with cute papers saying why I love her, and some candies too (I had that idea but I couldn't find the materials on time). 
- Now, a couple of days ago talking about parenthood she asked me if I wanted to make her a mother, which I replied that I'd love to but first we need to go through a lot of things I would love to do with her, and she got mad at me saying that I'm always clarifying that like she was stupid, and we didn't talk for the rest of the day. At night I sent her a message asking how she was feeling, but she didn't reply so I didn't send her any other text, thinking that maybe she just didn't want to talk to me. The next morning, she felt angry and disappointed again because ""how could I let her go to sleep crying and making her think that I don't care about her feelings and I didn't take care of her"", not even sending her a ""good night, love you text"".
On that Friday I went to pick her up from her job and had a coffee together, and I told her that I'm always feeling guilty from what I ""couldn't achieve"" despite everything else, but she spoke a few words saying that I have 3 strikes already at disappointing her, that she wasn't sure to meet on Saturday (as we planned a couple of days before this episode), and that she doesn't wants to be with someone who is not interested on spending time and taking care of her, making her going to bed crying. After that afternoon at night, we chatted a little bit more relaxed but with some distance, and then on Saturday she sent me ""good morning love of my life"" as the first message, then sent me pictures of her wearing one of my shirts I borrowed her weeks ago, and asked me if we were going to meet on that Saturday night but I said that I wanted to but it was difficult since I had to do other stuff (and thinking she still didn't want to see me), to which she got sad and started crying saying that I just don't care about her and that I said days ago that I wanted to meet her but now I don't, so I called her and told her how I was feeling, and it ended up with me saying that I needed some time to process everything we spoke, and that I spoke with some friends and family about this issue. She told me that she wanted to fix things but I was letting her down with this request, but if I needed time then ""go on"", and since then we haven't talked. I have just sent her some voice messages telling her that I want to fix things and not break up because we are starting to date and know each other and I love her, but I got no reply at all for now...
Every episode we had, of course, ended with me saying sorry and begging her to not leave me because I love her and I truly want a future together. 

I personally think that, aside from all the things I said or made that made her feel this way, I have been a good boyfriend overall and I tried to make her feel loved, cared for, comfortable and respected. I have always been for her when she had problems at her house or at her job, recieved her at my parents house or my apartment (to the latest she comes from her job or house with a bus, and in both places she left some clothes of her and other things like toothbrushes), spending days and nights with her making plans like going out for dinner (I am currently unemployed looking for a job, and finishing an university career so I'm not in the best economical situation), cooking together and watching movies or whatever she likes, going for walks to parks or the city, and other plans where I am the one offering transport and/or housing. Sometimes when I can, I go to pick her from her job with my family's car on Sundays at midnight even if it's raining (it's a 40 minutes drive) with some treats, to bring her to my parents house and helping her to finish some undone work she had, and then trying to make her relax and rest after her long day at work. I even introduced her to my whole family and friends, but I have never been to her house and never met her family or friends because she never invited me, and when I try to take her to her house with my family's car she just doesn't wants to, and asks me to leave her nearby so she can take a taxi to her house.

 We had other minor episodes which resulted in her not speaking to me for a couple of hours and being with a serious face, like one time I turned off my mobile data when we were at a bar and she got mad at me saying that that was a strange thing to do, but I wasn't hiding anything and I never cheated on her, just wanted to spend time 100% with her with no distractions.

 But overall (almost) everytime we hung out we are always smiling and laughing, and saying cute things to eachother, and even we gave eachother some nice details/gifts throughout the relationship, like her decorating my bedroom for my birthday and giving me pictures of us together, or me writing her a letter when I asked her to be my girlfriend, or the jar and other things (I don't consider myself materialistic at all but I take those things into account for both of us).

I really don't know if I'm doing things THAT bad to make her feel that way, or if the problem is another thing that is personal from her. I don't want to break up, despite what my friends and family say about doing it, because I still love her for what she is and I really enjoy her company..
