1nrz358,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1nrz358/stealing_side_mission_thalssamor/,Stealing- Side Mission Thalssamor,"Than the woman disappeared, Noah never managed to take a good look at her through the hazy dark smoke covering her as a way to hide her identity.  
  
“Nightmare powers are truly useful, if only you could do this in real life as well and not just in dreams”  
  
When the woman once stood now resided a small briefcase detailing his mission: He’s goal was to steal the briefcase containing  
The documents he was targeting belong Raoul Chrimata, a wealthy merchant and member of a faction Called the Pearl of Everpresence. Normally stealing from a high member like this was fundamentally impossible for a simple seq 9 like himself, thankfully that was not his actual target, his actual target was his assistant, suspected to be a seq 8 of the Monster pathway, a Robot.  
  
From his previous studies Noah knew that robots were highly capable individuals, supernaturally knowing when and how to move to avoid an outcome they wouldn’t like.  
  
“The target lived near the the Lantern Bazaar, his name was Theodor, he was 1.75 ms, sporting a clean shaven look with tidy kept hair. When he was young he suffered an accident that left him blind in his right eye and disfigured so to cover for that he wears an eyepatch, he also likes to wear white shirts combined with dark brown pants and a windblazer, he doesn’t like top hats. The accident was that a piece of debris flew and hit him in the eye after nearby gas canister exploded,  he lives alone and liked to go shopping for fresh ingredients every day, his parents grew…”  
  
“He wears a briefcase tied to his hand through a pair of handcuffs. After stealing it drop the briefcase at Saint Avernue, nr 46, in a dark alley between 2 shops”  
  
Noah was absolutely astonished, the documents presented Noah with almost every minute detail someone can have, from the way he likes his food to his family tree to even his workout routine.  
  
“That’s, a bit obsessive.”  
  
Of course he realized what that the “Nightmare faction” didn’t do this just to show off, it was also a veiled threat. “We can know what you do each and any day of your life, if you dare to cross us we will find you and kill you before you even know it.”.  
  
At the same time Noah had another revelation, he needed to do this as secretively as possible, a faction going through all the struggle to give his mission via a dream more than likely didn’t want to make a scene.  
  
With that in mind he darted off to sleep.  
  
Next morning he woke up full off energy, despite everything and how clearly the faction was manipulating him he knew his best shot is to listen to them.  
  
However he was not naïve, his years of being a thief himself have made him quite suspicious of his task.  
  
“Are you telling me this assistant, a mere sequence 8 in a city full of beyonders is holding important documents on his hand? It’s basically asking to be stolen. Or could this be a test from the higher ups?  Maybe he is just a bait? The real question is this, what is the faction testing me on? On my capabilities of stealing from someone of similar strength or my intellect. To be fair, while it did mention he wears a briefcase on his hand it didn’t specify that’s the correct briefcase, I seriously doubt they wouldn’t know where the correct briefcase is. That means that the briefcase on his hand might be a trap. Or maybe they are just information obsessed enough to make me do all of this for some trade transactions that he has on his hand. The pletera of details about the target seems to suggest that but again, that should be mostly an intimidation tactic.”  
  
But first, he cut Arthur’s hair, turning his once flowy hair into a short, military look, trying himself to distance from the image of the cultist as much as possible, he also decided to let his beard grow but for now this will have to do.  
  
Unsure on what to do he decided to not take the bait, to his experience as a thief it was clearly to suspicious so he decided to check his house first, to do that he first went to the Lantern Bazaar and pretended to be a regular customer, checking the different stalls one by one while keeping one of eye on the location from where the robot is supposed to come. Yet that didn’t happen.  
  
“Weird, shouldn’t he come down any time soon? Could it be that he possesses a certain level of danger intuition, perhaps he divines every day if coming to the market stalls is safe? Curses.”  
  
He continued to check the stalls one by one, occasionally buying some new clothes, costing him a total of 15 pounds on his new suit. Other times he would take a few bucks from the people who were better dressed, not a lot to prevent affecting them in any significant manner. Despite his privileged upbgringing Noah had a strong moral compass and refused to do things that would affect peoples lives, he managed to make a total of 30 pounds in total after more than 50 victims”  
  
After a few hours of this he went to a nearby restaurant, the restaurant was quite fancy, resting on top of a luxurious hotel, from there he could clearly see in Theodore’s apartment a flickering light meaning he was still home, or irresponsible. He took his seat as close to the windows as possible and waited , delighting himself in a variety of drinks and fish until more than 5 hours have passed. It has been more than 10 hours since he started this mission yet he only managed to lose 17 pounds and his time.  
  
Despite that he still persisted, for the next few days he waited and waited. Deciding to wait for the robot to starve, until his hunger would get the better of him and he will be forced to go out. The faction who tasked him for this never informed him of a time limit so he decided this is the best case of action, overwhelming his opponent through this simple strategy. Of course he suspected someone entered the Robot’s apartment he would assume someone brought him food and change his approach again but from all his constant observation that did not happen, meaning he lacked the means to communicate with someone else.  
  
After almost an entire week as he was trying on a new blouse he saw him with the corner of his eyes, looking weak and exhausted while barely being able to stay on his feet, with the briefcase tied to his hand, Theodor, he noticed him leaving his apartment and going to a nearby street where all the restaurants were.  
  
Of course he took things slow and to attract as little attention as possible, after all the possibility he dared to leave his house because someone is watching over him is very much real, of course that might also mean the important documents in his house were also missing but despite that he made a bet, a bet that if Theodor managed to get help they would shadow him and not his house.  Despite that he could’t be to slow, he bought the blouse while still wearing it, grabbed the rest of his things and left.  
  
He than continued on the main street before taking a sharp turn, Noah knew Theodor was exhausted and couldn’t move to fast so he decided to cut him off and bump into him while stealing his house keys. The streets were as full of people as ever so someone bumping into Theodor shouldn’t alarm anyone.  
  
So that’s what he did, took a sharp left and went full speed ahead into the direction the nearest restaurants are, where he saw the weak Theodor.  
  
“Sorry” Noah said as he bumped into him, mission successful, he managed to get his keys just as planned. Than he anxiously continued to the nearest restaurant where he sat down to drink a cup of caffeinated algae juice, or coffee for short. Despite being made from algae crossbred with coffee beans so they can grow in Thalssamor’s conditions the drink was relatively sweet, tasting more of coffee with sugar and milk than pure coffee.  
  
After enjoying his cup of coffee he finally went towards Theodor’s apartment. Despite being anxious on the inside, on the outside he was as calm as he can be, opening the door to the house and leaving the keys into the key hole (an attempt to make Theodor believe he simply forgot his keys after locking the door, not that he lost them completely).  
  
The apartment looked like a regular apartment, having the basic necessities like a kitchen a bathroom and 1 bedroom. Using his improved observation skills he started to look around, his guess was that  if there were important documents here they would be under a floor board. After getting inside it took Noah not even 2 minutes before noticing that one of the floor board wasn’t nailed to the floor. The floor board as expected was hiding a briefcase.  
  
Noah wasted no time, fearing the Robot might return home any moment now he quickly grabbed the briefcase, replaced it with a another briefcase he prepared earlier, the same as the model Theodor had on his hand and left. In not even 5 minutes since he entered the building he left. As he was leaving he saw Theodor with a panicked look on his face hurrying home. However he was dizzy due to him being weak Noah payed him no mind as he disappeared into the crowd.  
  
Theodor wouldn’t know that someone got inside his house and stole that briefcase until he had to deliver it, Noah suspecting Theodor didn’t have permission to open it.  
  
Than he made his way to the drop off point, a dark alley and put the briefcase between 2 trashcans.

Unlimited hotdog and pizza on me 🍕

I’m a secret rebel currently masquerading as a VP in tech aka corpo drone, constantly trying to get back at loblaws while figuring out how to get around this city with construction galore. Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace for this fall/winter), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, physically active partner who wants company for her dog walks and I dunno… nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Currently busy growing a mini jungle at home, adding to my Spotify playlist each week, already looking forward getting excited like a kid again with this years hockey season (damn you leafs 😭), playing random rec sports (floor hockey, beach volleyball etc) each week to stay active and sneaking in standup comedy/concerts (join me!) as much as possible. Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica and all over parts of US so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

Physically I’m 5’11, 205, light brown complexion, shaved head and a thick black beard (now featuring white strands!) and live in downtown Toronto near exhibition place. Ideally looking for someone local within the downtown area as one of my love languages is quality time and through past relationships, I’ve learned how much i appreciate spending time with my partner.

If any of this intrigues you, feel free to send me a chat message. On a side note, I spend way too much time on the “petsareamazing” subreddit group getting my animal fix… feel free to share any of your fav vids!

We're adults. we don't need this parental mode, this one size fits all approach that treats us like children.

And in the process, you've broken everything. 4o gets nerfed after the first response and routed to a lobotomized version of gpt5. now both models are compromised. why are you so determined to make every single one of your users furious?

This isn't about which model is 'better' anymore. this is about trust, and you've completely shattered it. at this point, it feels like straight up fraud.

I used to be a very tiny petite woman and now I have my cute lil boulder! Yes im uncomfortable and all that but I just think as long as he is safe thats all I care about.
Anyways im struggling to find clothes that fit as im sure we all do!! There isnt a lot of option that is comfortable. However the other day my husband gave me one of his NFL jerseys and I paired it with a high ponytail nice and messy!, did my makeup(i dont normally bother unless special occasion) , tucked it just above my bump and paired it with cute uggs and jeans. I felt amazing for the first time in a while about how I looked and most importantly comfortable too! My sister and husband thought i looked so cute and said i looked lovley.... 

Until we went out for the day.... I have never felt so judged. People were looking me up and down frowning... we just walked through town and had a coffee and lots of old people glaring making double takes...  then when I got home I cried because I felt truly utterly defeated. I feel like maybe I just took it to heart but I have never been out before and felt quite so judged. Can anyone give any advice on some outfit ideas? Was it my outfit?  My husband said I looked gorgeous and that i should take no notice of silly people. He also thinks that because of my size people might think im a lot younger  (especially when my sister joins us because she is 18 so i tend to get asked for id ect when im with her but never when im alone or with my husband) so might be just judging about that... but i still dont think that should be a reason for people to be so judgemental regardless... if anyone has any advice on clothes anything at all I would appreciate it!

1nryzyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1nryzyd/its_been_2_months_since_my_situationship_ended/,It's been 2 months since my situationship ended. 24M 24F.,"I'm writing this for those who might be going through a heartbreak right now.

Those who recently had a breakup, maybe from a relationship/situationship or whatsoever. And have been in no contact.

I'm writing this as a journal for me. And maybe so that someone in future comes across this thread when he/she needs it.

So we met for the last time on 26th July (""dard-e-disco"" for real). After multiple fights, no contacts from both the sides. And she decided to end it for real this time.

She wished me well. While I stood there handing her over a gift that I had bought for her.

We both had our eyes filled as I walk away to my car. And, as I'm driving away, I kept seeing her in rearview mirror walking away, and turning back again and again as she saw my car go further and further away. Perfect filmy ""palat, palat"" moment lol.

So first week was miserable. I couldn't eat, sleep or do anything. I was smoking 8-10 cigarettes since last month due to this toxic relationship we had. And the no contact didn't help. 

Everyone around me, be it my childhood friends, my work friends or just normal colleagues could sense without even me saying a word that something was wrong with me. I was sleeping for only 3-4 hours. It was hell.

2nd week is when I pretended to be happy again so that people around me think I've moved on. I started again to talk a lot, have fun, make jokes and spread positivity around while I was dying inside.

Week 3 She pings me against, asks me to meet for a casual coffee or bowling. I say ""let's see"" but don't follow up, neither does she.

I fall into the hell hole again (thanks to her). I could not longer keep the act of being happy. I stop meeting and talking to anyone at work. Being alone and depressed becomes my new hobby. And yeah also started writing rap or shayaris(that suck) to vent out. But yeah it kinda helped to let it out.

Week 4
She texts me asking about one of our mutual friend who's was going through someone's loss. She asks if it's true, I tell her yes. Then she pings how/where/whys. And I leave her on seen. The biggest step probably because this was a silent message that I am done being played as per her convience.


September 2025.

I get diagnosed with telogen effluvium. In layman terms, it's basically a condition where hair fall increases after a stressful event. Derma said it was due to some underlying stress. I've been losing 80-90 hair since then. Showers are rough when you see so many hair fallout from your scalp.

I had dense hair that everyone complemented. But now it's very thin than before.

My acne increased and i developed cytic acnes and it is also leading to scarring. Dermat said it's probably because of stress and increase in smoking.

I decided to try and take some control of my life.

Firstly, started the treatment given by my Dermat for acne and hair fall. 

Started gym. I went from 65kg to 53kg in 8 months of my situationship. And skipping meals also contributed to my weightloss. And i reduced smoking to 1 or 2 ciggerates.

Week 8
Today it's been 2 months. It's been 1 week since I've gone cold turkey.

Cravings and mood swings were intense for first 2 days. Then it returns on 5th/6th day. But if you keep at it and don't light one up, it goes away. I usually have a cup of coffee when I am having too much anxiety. Doesn't really help my anxiety, but distracts me from buying a ciggerate.

I have gained 2 kgs too. But acne and hair fall will take time i guess.

Today's 27th. Exactly 2 months from meeting her. And almost 1 month of total no contact.

I still miss her. I see her name while watching a show, or when I'm passing by a random shop, or the waiter at serving me my dish. 

It's bizarre that when you wanna avoid a person, universe does stuff like this just to have a laugh lol.

Will be writing an update next month. I hope October treats me better.",1,1758989176.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

What is the correct way to get more yield?,"I've been drinking moka pot coffee for about 3 years now and I've never gotten good results with anything more than 1:4.5 ratio (weight of coffee:yield of drink). 

When I make coffee that the roaster describes ""for espresso"", it's about 15-16 grams and 55-65 ml of yield. When I make what the roaster describes ""for filter"", I can go up to 70 ml.

 I usually stop the process by dropping the moka pot into a bowl with cold water when I see that the output has reached a certain level. But I know that this yield is considered relatively small and that people squeeze out 80 ml and even 90 ml from 3 cup moka. And I see that some people leave the moka pot on the stove and let all the water come out, and it kinda scares me.

I brew very carefully, either with a Turkish coffee lighter or on an electric stove. I use AeroPress filters and try to extend the brew to a 60-70 seconds. My grind is relatively coarse, a little finer than some people use for pour-overs. But grinder is so-so (a slightly worn 40mm conical Wilfa), so maybe because of that I get channeled flavors and an unpleasant aftertaste if I grind any finer. The base has hot water, but not boiling. Sometimes I experiment with cold water.

Anyway, every time I tried making more than my usual yield, the taste going halfway to an ""Americano"" from a not very good coffee shop; nothing remained of that bright and sweet ""almost espresso"" I'm used to. I used to think that those 15-20 ml are bad enough to be able to ruin the whole drink. Everything turns into tasteless mud for me. But that's exactly how most people brew it ! 

What am I missing ? How to make a large yield and get sweet coffee with unmuddy flavors ? How do people do it ? Or is it just that Covid has affected me more than others and i become less sensitive and now I need more concentrated stuff to feel something ?",1,1758989130.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

If/when it ever becomes available in the US I'll probably pick up a pack since I want to support the game and I think being able to actually drink a can of Ospuze is neat. So this isn't a dealbreaker or anything.

With that said, the whole point of having this type of product is that it should feel like something that came straight from the game into real-life. The final design of the can kinda fails at this, it looks more like a Finals-branded energy drink than an actual can of Ospuze.

I think I read somewhere that Embark plans to add this new flavor to the game. If that's the case, it feels more like they're adding the real-life energy drink to the game than vice-versa. 

Like I said it's not a deal breaker or anything, I think it's still cool enough that I'm going to buy it. I just wish it looked more like how it actually does in-game. ",2,1758988908.0,thefinals,0,0.67,False

I've been given an expobar machine. It was uncared for, gummed up with old coffee. I spent half a day disassembling it, cleaning everything I could. Once the water supply was connected it took another hour for the heat and pressure to unstick some of the valves or pumps so that everything was working, and now it is.

What I'm wondering is if anyone knows anything about this exact variant of expobar? I can't find another photo anywhere on the internet matching this one. It's as if it had a run of manufacture from spare parts in the factory ?

I'm curious to know more about the machine.

Makes perfectly good coffee.

I woke up at my usual weekday time today. Got up, showered, made breakfast, made coffee and am enjoying just existing with no commitments this morning with my lovely dogs snuggling by my side.

Previously, I would get up early so I could drink before my husband got up. I wouldn’t even drink coffee, just wine.

I think I’m going to eventually get ready and go for a walk, maybe even go to the farmers market. Previously I wouldn’t have wanted to go to the farmers market because there’s no alcohol there…well there are some wineries that do tastings but it’s not like you can just buy a drink and walk around with it.

I started the I Am Sober app. I estimate I was spending $220 a week on alcohol - this is a conservative estimate that doesn’t even count getting drinks out. That is only for the drinks I consumed at home! I can’t believe I was spending almost $10k a year just on my daily mid tier vodka and wine. I feel like I should be doing something with this extra money now that I can be proud of, but haven’t put much thought into it yet.

I reorganized the garage refrigerator. Growing up, the rich families I knew had a garage fridge full of beverages. I have achieved that dream! Previously it had quite a bit of alcoholic beverages in it. But, I specifically bought a bunch of carbonated beverages to stuff the fridge so full that I could possibly put any new alcoholic beverages in it. There are still a few out there but for the most part they’re drinks I don’t like, ones that others in the house like, so I don’t feel tempted. The one thing I did notice though is 2 bottles of champagne that are unopened. I was thinking…when I have something big to celebrate…will I want to drink it? Unknown at this point as so far there hasn’t been cause for a big celebration.

Those who recently had a breakup, maybe from a relationship/situationship or whatsoever. And have been in no contact.

I'm writing this as a journal for me. And maybe so that someone in future comes across this thread when he/she needs it.

So we met for the last time on 26th July (""dard-e-disco"" for real). After multiple fights, no contacts from both the sides. And she decided to end it for real this time.

She wished me well. While I stood there handing her over a gift that I had bought for her.

We both had our eyes filled as I walk away to my car. And, as I'm driving away, I kept seeing her in rearview mirror walking away, and turning back again and again as she saw my car go further and further away. Perfect filmy ""palat, palat"" moment lol.

So first week was miserable. I couldn't eat, sleep or do anything. I was smoking 8-10 cigarettes since last month due to this toxic relationship we had. And the no contact didn't help. 

Everyone around me, be it my childhood friends, my work friends or just normal colleagues could sense without even me saying a word that something was wrong with me. I was sleeping for only 3-4 hours. It was hell.

2nd week is when I pretended to be happy again so that people around me think I've moved on. I started again to talk a lot, have fun, make jokes and spread positivity around while I was dying inside.

Week 3 She pings me against, asks me to meet for a casual coffee or bowling. I say ""let's see"" but don't follow up, neither does she.

I fall into the hell hole again (thanks to her). I could not longer keep the act of being happy. I stop meeting and talking to anyone at work. Being alone and depressed becomes my new hobby. And yeah also started writing rap or shayaris(that suck) to vent out. But yeah it kinda helped to let it out.

Week 4
She texts me asking about one of our mutual friend who's was going through someone's loss. She asks if it's true, I tell her yes. Then she pings how/where/whys. And I leave her on seen. The biggest step probably because this was a silent message that I am done being played as per her convience.


September 2025.

I get diagnosed with telogen effluvium. In layman terms, it's basically a condition where hair fall increases after a stressful event. Derma said it was due to some underlying stress. I've been losing 80-90 hair since then. Showers are rough when you see so many hair fallout from your scalp.

I had dense hair that everyone complemented. But now it's very thin than before.

My acne increased and i developed cytic acnes and it is also leading to scarring. Dermat said it's probably because of stress and increase in smoking.

I decided to try and take some control of my life.

Firstly, started the treatment given by my Dermat for acne and hair fall. 

Started gym. I went from 65kg to 53kg in 8 months of my situationship. And skipping meals also contributed to my weightloss. And i reduced smoking to 1 or 2 ciggerates.

Week 8
Today it's been 2 months. It's been 1 week since I've gone cold turkey.

Cravings and mood swings were intense for first 2 days. Then it returns on 5th/6th day. But if you keep at it and don't light one up, it goes away. I usually have a cup of coffee when I am having too much anxiety. Doesn't really help my anxiety, but distracts me from buying a ciggerate.

I have gained 2 kgs too. But acne and hair fall will take time i guess.

Today's 27th. Exactly 2 months from meeting her. And almost 1 month of total no contact.

I still miss her. I see her name while watching a show, or when I'm passing by a random shop, or the waiter at serving me my dish. 

It's bizarre that when you wanna avoid a person, universe does stuff like this just to have a laugh lol.

Will be writing an update next month. I hope October treats me better.",2,1758988735.0,RelationshipIndia,4,1.0,False

1nryr0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1nryr0v/should_you_try_mrs_meyers_multisurface_cleaner/,Should You Try Mrs. Meyer's Multi-Surface Cleaner for Your Home,"Testing out Mrs. Meyer's 384354 multi-surface cleaner was, to put it simply, a bit like discovering the holy grail of household products—but with a touch of blueberry-scented magic. As someone who is always hunting for an effective yet eco-friendly option, this cleaner quickly found itself front and center in my cleaning arsenal. By the third use, I was convinced this wasn't just a cleaning spray; it's a small bottle of domestic sorcery. 

**Design and Packaging**  
Before even using it, the packaging caught my attention. The bottles come in a practical, compact design that's easy to store but also elegant enough to look cute sitting on the kitchen counter. Each of the three bottles in this pack of 16-ounce cleaners feels sturdy, and the spray nozzle is designed for precision—no awkward looking streams of product squirting wildly out. Everything about the design screams simplicity, which I appreciated as someone who doesn’t want cleaning tools that are more complicated than my vacuum cleaner.

**Blueberry Scent Experience**  
Cleaning isn’t exactly something I typically look forward to, but the scent made the process oddly pleasant. Blueberry isn’t your conventional cleaning product aroma, but it works. There’s a sweet, sun-ripened freshness that fills a room without being overpowering. It’s like capturing the essence of a sunny summer morning and bottling it in a spray. My kids even walked into the kitchen asking if I’d been baking muffins. What other cleaner doubles as air freshener? Certainly not the chemical-drenched monstrosities I’ve used in the past.

**Easy to Use Features**  
What sets this cleaner apart is how versatile it is while being incredibly easy to use. This product isn’t a diva. I’ve successfully tested it on countertops, tile floors, and even lightly sealed wood surfaces. Simply spray, wipe, and voilà—no streaks or sticky residues left behind. It’s particularly a lifesaver in the mornings when the kitchen counters bear the aftermath of hurried breakfasts. Cereal spills, coffee stains, and even a literal jam here and there disappeared with one quick spritz. I also tested it on bathroom fixtures and non-porous walls without any issues. Multi-surface indeed means MULTI-surface.  

[Grab Mrs. Meyer’s 384354 at the best price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0dq2jbxrs/)

**Good Points**  
- Effective on a variety of surfaces, including wood, tiles, and countertops.  
- Leaves no streaks or sticky residue after cleaning.  
- Blueberry scent is delightful and unique, freshening up the room effortlessly.  
- Cruelty-free and environmentally friendly, which is always a win in my book.  

**Flaws**  
Not every star has its shadow. The primary downside I noticed was that while the spray covers smaller surfaces quite easily, using it on larger areas like long stretches of tile floors felt inefficient. I had to go through quite a bit of product for those areas, which might make it less economical for bigger cleaning tasks. Additionally, although the scent is pleasant, it might not appeal to those who prefer unscented options or more traditional fresh scents.  

- Coverage on larger spaces requires more effort and product.  
- Strong blueberry scent may not be for everyone.  

**Product Rivals**  
You can’t judge a cleaner in isolation, so I compared Mrs. Meyer’s cleaner to a couple of others that have graced my cleaning pantry. Against Method and Seventh Generation products, this spray holds its ground as being equally effective and perhaps a touch more aesthetic when it comes to scent diversity. However, Method has the upper hand with its wider range of surface-specific cleaners, while Mrs. Meyer’s focuses more on versatility. Seventh Generation products edged slightly ahead in terms of transparency about all their ingredients, but they lacked the whimsical charm of this blueberry scent. Safety features like being non-toxic and cruelty-free are shared across these brands, so in that regard, they’re tied.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The price-to-quality ratio for this cleaner feels spot-on. It’s rare to find a cleaning product that’s both effective and thoughtfully made. While it might lean slightly on the pricier side compared to generic brands, the additional cost is justified for the quality, fragrance, and its eco-conscious credentials. If you’re someone who’s mindful of what products you bring into your home, this one is a smart splurge that doesn’t hit the wallet too hard.

1nryqmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitiligo/comments/1nryqmb/how_i_stopped_and_reversed_my_vitiligo_no_creams/,How I stopped and reversed my vitiligo (no creams),"I had vitiligo. It started showing up around 2013–2014, even on my face. I’d had a bad accident in 2011, was on heavy pain meds for a long time, and basically destroyed my stomach. Coffee and alcohol were a regular thing too, and by that time my digestion was all over the place, bowel movements were never normal.

When the vitiligo patches came in, the dermatologist wanted me to try creams and treat it from the outside. I wasn’t convinced. Something about it didn’t sit right. So I hit up Google, while reading online I kept seeing a common theme: a lot of people with vitiligo also had gut or stomach problems. That clicked. 

So I cut out the alcohol and coffee and started messing around with probiotics and prebiotics, switching them up every so often. After a few months of focusing on my stomach, the spread slowed down… then stopped. Eventually I even started to see a  reversal, repigmentation!!

Right now in 2025 I still have a couple tiny spots, but no more spots on the face. they haven’t progressed, and most of it has gone back approximately 70%.

So my personal advice from this journey: get your stomach right first. Fix your biome. If you can get back to normal digestion, you might be surprised what happens.

Not medical advice lol…. just my story. Curious though, how many of you here also deal with stomach issues alongside vitiligo?

1nryqcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1nryqcc/should_you_trust_zep_carpet_shampoo_zuppc128_for/,Should You Trust Zep Carpet Shampoo ZUPPC128 for Deep Cleaning,"ZEP INC Carpet Shampoo, model ZUPPC128, has been a game-changer for keeping my home’s carpets spotlessly clean. It’s a product I’ve been testing both on my own carpets and at my cousin’s house after her mischievous dog had a field day with muddy paws. My first thought was, “How much difference can a carpet shampoo really make?” But I have to admit, this one surprised me. I wanted to explore every nook and cranny of what this carpet cleaner has to offer, and that’s exactly what I did.

**User-Friendly Design and Packaging**  
One of the things that stood out immediately was the packaging. The 128 fl oz bottle is sturdy, tightly sealed, and surprisingly easy to handle despite its considerable size. At 8 pounds, it is not the lightest cleaning product I’ve worked with, but it’s clear that the brand prioritized professional-grade performance over portability. I appreciate that it’s a concentrated solution. I’ve used similar size containers before, and most of them made you feel like you were hauling a mini water cooler. Thankfully, the screw-top pour design eliminates unnecessary spills, which has saved me from the classic cleaning-supply mess. Within minutes, I had it diluted and ready to load into my carpet cleaning machine.

**Pros**  
- Makes up to 25 gallons with a single bottle, offering great longevity.  
- Professional-strength cleaning works wonders, even on stubborn stains.  
- The low-foam formula is compatible with machines and eliminates residue buildup.  

[Grab ZEP INC ZUPPC128 at the best price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b07v25vwnj/)  

**Performance and Cleaning Efficiency**  
The true test came when I tackled a coffee stain that had been plaguing my living room carpet for weeks. Being a professional-strength formula, I held high hopes, but I still pre-sprayed the area just in case. To my amazement, the stain nearly vanished after a single pass in the carpet cleaning machine. For areas with deeper foot traffic wear, I had to go over them twice, but the results were nothing short of a deep, refreshed clean. The subtle, fresh scent it leaves behind is a nice touch—almost like finishing off your cleaning with a gentle air freshener. 

What I also loved was the absence of excess foam during the process. Some products waste your time with too much frothy drama, clogging up machines or leaving behind a sticky coating. This one? Smooth sailing every time.

**Drawbacks**  
- The product doesn’t specify a strong eco-friendly component, which might matter to environmentally conscious users.  
- Its performance for delicate or antique carpets is not guaranteed—be cautious during use.  
- The bottle size, while value-packed, can be cumbersome for storage in smaller living spaces.  

**Sustainability and Versatility**  
While this shampoo delivers exceptional results for carpets, I did wish for clearer details around its environmental impact. There’s no explicit mention of any biodegradable or eco-certified perks, which is something I look for in products these days. That being said, its versatility is noteworthy. I tested it out on a couple of fabric chairs that were lightly stained, and with a careful dilution ratio, it worked comfortably outside of its typical carpet-cleaning duties.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other brands I’ve tried, like Bissell upright cleaning solutions or Hoover brand-specific formulas, the ZEP INC shampoo offers a much higher concentration level per bottle, which means you get more for your money. That said, Hoover tends to perform slightly better on tackling pet odors, while Bissell excels in leaving certain carpets softer to the touch. This product finds its sweet spot by offering consistency across various stain types and surfaces without feeling like a specialty item. If you’re looking at general cleaning needs, this shampoo holds its own.

**Value for Money**  
Here’s where it shines even more. The fact that a single bottle delivers 25 gallons of diluted solution is an absolute budget-friendly victory.

1nryigb,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1nryigb/blurb_for_my_first_novel_set_in_a_coffee/,Blurb for my first novel set in a coffee shop-style potion shop,"\***Feedback Requested**

I'm in the process of writing my first novel and got some positive feedback on Reddit this week about the main location for my story, being a potion shop modeled after our modern coffee shops. I have tried to take that concept and combine it with the characters and themes I had in mind for my first story, so this is the summary (sorry I don't have a cool title cooked up yet). I have developed some of the plot beyond this summary but am not sharing it here yet. I'd love your guys' feedback- please be critical because I'm about to spend the next couple years of my life on this project haha.

\*Please be aware that one of the main themes is processing grief from losing a loved one.\*

A bit of worldbuilding context:

\- The potion shops are run very much like a modern coffee shop; the ""baristas"" are called Elixirists

\- This shop (doesn't have a name yet) sources most of its ingredients from its exotic garden out back and from local traders

\- There are three main roles of responsibilities here- gardening/harvesting (keeping track of all the ingredients and making sure they're labeled), brewing potions and serving the customers, and running the nightly deliveries.

**Blurb of my first novel \[fantasy, 386 words\]**

*With his dad passing away last year, Aeran’s left with no choice but to sell their old home and downsize to make ends meet. Going through their things brings up so many memories, making the packing process painful; but when he finds his old journal and storybooks tossed aside in a tattered box, he realizes that he hadn’t only lost his dad, but also himself.* 



Aeran had a childhood dream to invent living creatures made of potions, inspired by stories and brainstorming with his dad. His journal was full of sketches of goopy, jelly-like creatures that had appearances and personalities like the potions they were made after. They had no bones and could even shrink to fit inside a potion bottle, looking very much like their original potions. 

But after his dad died in a tragic accident, a year ago now, Aeran’s passion fizzled out as he drowned in grief. Working as an elixirist at the potion shop used to be everything to him. He worked the late shift, running the shop in the afternoon- engaging with customers, brewing their potions, and maintaining the stock- and making deliveries in the evening, traveling all over the city with his cart. His dad would accompany him sometimes, and the night would disappear as they laughed together and conversed with the neighbors. 

But now the customers annoy him, wasting valuable ingredients on silly potion blends; the deliveries are too quiet and his feet hurt from the walking; and the potions are just colorful bottles of liquid. They don’t shimmer like they used to.

Finding his old journal made him miss the boy he once was. He wanted to laugh again as he sketched absurd little creatures, to smile as he worked proudly on his brews, to be himself. But how could he? His dad would always encourage his experiments and often said that once Aeran had his big breakthrough, he’d be sitting in the front row cheering when he was recognized by their city as a genius. But now, even if Aeran achieves his dream, his dad’s chair will be empty.



Will Aeran’s childhood dream be enough to rekindle his passion for potion craft, or will it only add to his burdens of grief as he struggles to pick himself up again in the wake of his dad’s passing?

My issue is that I kind of feel like he's abusing it. He was on lexapro before but it caused a lot of side effects that I now suspect were mild serotonin syndrome caused by taking chantix at the same time. 
He's supposed to take 20 mg once a day. He's one of those that seems to get a ""high"" from the dose soon after taking it. I can tell the days when he takes it because he's much more personable and I can actually talk to him without a fight starting or feeling like I'm talking to a brick wall. He does well taking it for a few days, then stops taking it. (He's says he forgets) Other times, he pops a pill right before he has to do something stressful,  like a 2 hour drive to a work site,  or before going to an big meeting at work, or even just where there's going to be large crowds of people. After 2-3days of ""forgetting"" he starts getting super edgy and turns into a total jerk. I'm talking yelling at people over the slightest perceived disrespect, aggressive driving, and a generally nasty attitude. 
I started counting his pills every morning after he left for work to make sure he was taking them. I understand that prozac has a long half life, so there's some grace with forgetting one dose. But after I would recognize 2 missed doses, I would ask him if he remembered his pill that morning. I've tried to help him by setting the bottle next to the coffee maker in the morning so he'll see and remember to take it. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. I got a daily pill case to put the pills in so he knows when he has taken them. He just opens whatever pack and takes one, or doesn't take any. Aside from standing next to him and making him take it like a prison nurse,  or his mother, there's no way to make sure he's taking it regularly and following his treatment plan. 
I have gone to some of his behavioral health appointments with him, at his request, and found out he's lying to the provider. He tells them that the pills aren't working and he needs to up the dose, but so far the provider has advised against that to give it time to build up in his system. 
I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this roller-coaster, either personally or with a loved one, and did they find anything that helped them get off the hell ride? What are my options? ",1,1758987952.0,prozac,1,1.0,False

Thanks in advance. Just a little back story, me and my husband have been married for 15 years. He has two children from another marriage.  I have loved and cared for these kids as they were my own. A year after we got married we had our youngest daughter together.  And we've lived under the same roof ever since. 

Here we are today, and the oldest daughter will ne turning 20 this January, and the youngest also turning 14 in January.  They both habe aways shared a room with little to any problems until now. Last year it had came to my realization that the oldest daughter wasnt as clean as I thought she was. To the point she had a full trash bag of empty fold items just laid all out on her mattress thay she was sleeping on.

She had bowels with old food growing mold either on her bed or around her bed. On top of thay she had bought a small coffee pot and crock pot thay she had in her room which both had been sitting for so long that they both also was growing mold.  I lost it when I realized this!! Both me and her father didnt raised her to live/sleep this way. 

I would understand if she had disabilities that caused her to not be able to clean up after herself, or what not but she doesn't.  She literally has to walk through the kitchen to go to work. So why wouldn't she take her dishes put them in tne sink, and the trash in the can. It's unhealthy physical and mentally to live that way. If she wants to live that way then fine.  But id be damned if she's going to do it in my house, and expose my youngest daughter to that. 

I had talked to my husband and told him how I felt and that I thought it was disrespectful, not healthy, and I didnt appreciate that fact that our youngest daughter had to live in the same room as someone who decided to live that way when she didnt choose to. I flat out told him that if it was one of my adult children living in my house. Who doesnt contribute tl the house hold bills or groceries, theh would have to leave. It may be tought, but she wasnt raised to be lazy like that, and my house doesnt look like that.

So her just told her not to eat or drink in there. She didnt for about 6-7 months, then she was allowed thay choice again. Thinking ok shes almost 20 and haven't been able to. So her behavior may change. Here we are about 5 months later, I walk in to wake up my youngest for school, and see thay she has started collecting trash in her space in the room again.
She had clothes all over the floor and had just a small box full of dirty paper plates, candy wrappers, snack cake wrappers, soda cans...etc.

Again even though she has to walk through the kitchen and right in front of the trash cans to go to work everyday. I told my husband she had started collecting trash agakn, which also lead to the moldly dishes in her space of the room last time. All he did was tell her to take her trash out. Then later on told me ""shes not allowed to eat and drink in there anymore."" 

As she walked out of the room today, she walks out with a drink. I asked him i thought sje wasnt allowed anything back there anymore. For his excuse to be is ""he hasn't seen her."" Bjt he saw her yesterday when he told her to take out her trash. So I feel like he just told me that so id shut up about it. But im to the point shes done it before, and if I had never gone in there it would of never of been found. Then shes starting to do it again. I dont want to live like this. And I dont want my youngest daughter to have to live in a room like that. 

Im to the point I just want her to move out. Yeah its harsh. But I feel like its to the point she doesnt care and has proven that she doesnt care about our house and our rules, or the unhealthy habits she has, let along with the health problems it could cause her, or her sister. She's just lazy, theres no reason for her not to clean up after herself. This was a huge fight last time this happened, im afraid if I say something to my husband its gonna cause problems.  Because im making him choose our daughter over his.  And his excuse will be ""but shes paying for her car, and $125, for her phone and insurance. "" I just dont feel like that an excuse.  If she wants to live that way she can move in with her mom, grandma,  or tje friends that habe been asking her to move in with them. ",29,1758987422.0,AITH,31,0.83,False

So I cleaned, organized, and set things up the same way he always did back in the apartment like the kitchen, the bathroom, all of it. A week later, he complained and told me I did a horrible job. He even said he will never ask me for anything in this lifetime, that he’ll just do everything by himself. That really broke me, because I tried my best and he never gave me any instructions.

Then this morning, I made coffee for him using coffee maker. I turn off it off because it’s taking him a while to get it and the bubbling makes me nervous if I leave it for too long. But when he went to pour it into his cup, he realized it had gotten cold. He threw it away, told me I wasn’t good at anything, and slammed the cabinet doors. I was on the phone with my uncle at that time, and I had to pretend I needed to go to the bathroom just to end the call. I’m not sure if he hears everything my husband is murmuring or the noises he made. Now I’m in here inside the bathroom crying, because if he sees me crying, he’ll just yell at me again.

I was about to cry at the kitchen but I force my smile at her so she won’t see that I’m sad. I’m not sure if she has the concept of what is sadness because she’s autistic.

I’m so hurt. He didn’t know that  I cry by myself everyday because every hurtful things he said to me keeps replaying my head and maybe I’m just a horrible wife. I’m just a stay at home wife who cannot work yet because I’m an immigrant who entered legally and doesn’t have papers yet for work. I have no money or contribution to the household. I have to cry for everything. I keep programming myself to be like a doll without feelings and only respond when he ask questions but I can’t because I love him and I always want to hug him and be near his side. It’s so hurting. It really hurts. It’s so hurtful.

As a bit of a foodie, this has been devastating. I know there are a lot of good nondairy replacements for things I usually use, but I'm having a hard time striking the right balance.

For instance, vegan recipes have been really helpful. But this morning I'm scouring the internet trying to find a recipe for coffee cake I can make. All the vegan ones, of course, exclude egg, and looking at them I can just see that the end product does not have the same lift as cakes that have egg in them. There is no reason I cannot use eggs, but am unsure how to incorporate it into the vegan recipe without messing everything up.

But if I look at the non-vegan recipes and try to figure it out with non-dairy replacement ingredients, they often include things like sour cream that I don't have a nondairy version of on hand. All I have is margarine and coconut oil. 

Does anyone have a decent recipe for coffee cake, or cakes/pastries in general, that include eggs, but not dairy ingredients? This is proving really difficutl to find. Let me know if you have any baking resources that would be helpful!",1,1758987326.0,dairyfree,4,1.0,False

I have tried to take that concept and combine it with the characters and themes I had in mind for my first story, so this is the summary (sorry I don't have a cool title cooked up yet). I have developed some of the plot beyond this summary but am not sharing it here yet. I'd love your guys' feedback- please be critical because I'm about to spend the next couple years of my life on this project haha.

\*Please be aware that one of the main themes is processing grief from losing a loved one.\* 

**Blurb of my first novel \[fantasy, 386 words\]**

*With his dad passing away last year, Aeran’s left with no choice but to sell their old home and downsize to make ends meet. Going through their things brings up so many memories, making the packing process painful; but when he finds his old journal and storybooks tossed aside in a tattered box, he realizes that he hadn’t only lost his dad, but also himself.* 



Aeran had a childhood dream to invent living creatures made of potions, inspired by stories and brainstorming with his dad. His journal was full of sketches of goopy, jelly-like creatures that had appearances and personalities like the potions they were made after. They had no bones and could even shrink to fit inside a potion bottle, looking very much like their original potions. 

But after his dad died in a tragic accident, a year ago now, Aeran’s passion fizzled out as he drowned in grief. Working as an elixirist at the potion shop used to be everything to him. He worked the late shift, running the shop in the afternoon- engaging with customers, brewing their potions, and maintaining the stock- and making deliveries in the evening, traveling all over the city with his cart. His dad would accompany him sometimes, and the night would disappear as they laughed together and conversed with the neighbors. 

But now the customers annoy him, wasting valuable ingredients on silly potion blends; the deliveries are too quiet and his feet hurt from the walking; and the potions are just colorful bottles of liquid. They don’t shimmer like they used to.

Finding his old journal made him miss the boy he once was. He wanted to laugh again as he sketched absurd little creatures, to smile as he worked proudly on his brews, to be himself. But how could he? His dad would always encourage his experiments and often said that once Aeran had his big breakthrough, he’d be sitting in the front row cheering when he was recognized by their city as a genius. But now, even if Aeran achieves his dream, his dad’s chair will be empty.



Will Aeran’s childhood dream be enough to rekindle his passion for potion craft, or will it only add to his burdens of grief as he struggles to pick himself up again in the wake of his dad’s passing?

So yea we became friends, he makes sensual jokes at me and I entertained it always.

1 month in, he and his girlfriend randomly invited me for coffee, weird right, I’d be third wheel. They PDA (kiss and tease each other) a lot in front of me while MAKING EYE CONTACT with me. Other than that they were both super talkative, asking me about my life. Till I told them about the girl I like, because they kept insisting I tell them, after I tell, they EXCHANGED LOOKS, STARED at me, their smiles literally faded, and the vibe was just off rest of the date. They are good terms with the girl I like, why do that?

Next day he avoided me, it went on for 3 weeks, till at this party, at a game of spin the bottle, it landed on us, we kissed and he PUSHED it! I won't get into detail but he wouldn't stop till I literally pushed him. Next day he invites me for food, treats me popsicles, he's back with his jokes and told me he’ll talk to my crush for me. Then Sunday comes he tells me she doesn’t like me back (when he was just supposed to ask if she liked anyone). So yeah, super sad. I asked asked asked but he wouldn’t tell me how the convo went. Instead, he's super pushy that I go chill at his place and spend the night to “make me feel better.” I lied and said I had plans. 

In those 3 weeks of ignoring me, he BARELY MADE EYE CONTACT or had a convo with me when I tried talking to him. Then suddenly after that party, he switches back. Paragraph 3 are just additional info of what happened after but when I can't sleep these past days the image of them staring at me when I told just appears in front of me.

I dont eat candy or sweets really.

I only drink water for every meal except milk for breakfast. (No coffee)

I dont eat alot of vegetables, mostly fruit.

That feeling of two days evaporating into nothing isn’t just in your head — it’s in your brain. Time doesn’t move slower or faster; our perception of it does. 

And the good news? You can hack it.

Sundays are the one sock that disappears in the laundry of life. You remember the plans, the hope, the promise that this weekend would feel different… and then, poof. Gone.

Here’s the thing: time is elastic. Scientists call it time perception. It speeds up when you’re bored, on autopilot, or repeating the same habits. It slows down when you’re curious, paying attention, or experiencing something novel.

I learned this the hard way one Saturday. I decided to do nothing I normally do. 

No routines. 
No scrolling. 
No autopilot. 

I wandered streets I’d walked a hundred times, made coffee the “wrong” way (spilling a little, tasting it anyway), and sat on my balcony watching clouds drift lazily across the sky.

For the first time, I noticed how differently time moves when you’re present. Every spilled drop of coffee, every passing cloud, every laugh over a slightly burnt pancake became a little anchor. 

The day felt longer. Fuller. Alive.

Here’s the secret twist: weekends vanish not because we lack hours but because we fail to notice them. Freedom isn’t about cramming in experiences—it’s about slowing down enough to experience them. Sip your coffee slowly. Watch a bird flinch in the wind. Pause mid-thought. 

Let your brain record the moment instead of fast-forwarding.

I’ll admit: I failed more than I succeeded at first. Schedules, checklists, over-planning… they made the weekend feel shorter, not longer. But the first time I deliberately broke the script, my weekend stretched like a tiny eternity.

The key: you don’t need more hours. You need more attention. Novelty. Presence. Intentionality. These don’t add minutes to a day, but they add weight, memory, and a sense of fullness. That fullness is what makes a weekend feel long.

Here’s my question for you: What’s one small, unfamiliar thing you could do this weekend—not to get more done, but to actually live it?

Try it. Take a pause. Explore a corner you usually skip. Notice one tiny detail you’d normally overlook. Share your experience in the comments — your insight could inspire someone else to finally stretch their own weekend.

I'm mostly content in the way we've set up our living room, but we still want to do some upgrades and we're starting to get stuck in analysis paralysis now because our living room is 'almost complete'... So I came here for some advice...

**Major** things i still see that could upgrade the place and would love some advice, inspiration on:

* an upgrade to the s**tanding lamp next to the tv**
* either **sconces/lamp/lamp combo** on the **mantelpiece** or a lamp on the left of it: we lack 'warm' light in the back of the living room. The problem with sconces is that while I think it's the best option for the mantelpiece, it's a rental so we can't drill and the ones with batteries seem a hassle.
* **upgrade** of the **curtains**. Right now those are very see through: people can look inside our living room and it feels too 'open' not cozy... Dark green seemed nice

Then these also come to mind but they are **not so important** to us:

* some more '**verticality**' either some shelves or a tall piece of display furniture on the left side of the window kitchen cutout
   * we think the room is already busy enough so perhaps it's just overkill
* an upgrade to the **coffee table**
   * might be nice but is not at all necessary we feel

You can still give suggestions, though :) (or roast our interior)

1nrxugb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nrxugb/portable_generator_vs_traditional_generator_whats/,Portable generator vs traditional generator: what's the difference?,"Hey everyone! I've been using generators for years, both for camping trips and as backup power during storms. Recently, I made the switch to a portable generator, and I thought I'd share my experience and break down the key differences between portable and traditional generators.

First off, let's talk about size and mobility. Traditional generators are like the dinosaurs of the power world - big, heavy, and usually need a permanent spot in your yard. I used to have one of these beasts, and moving it was a two-person job. Portable generators, on the other hand, are game-changers. I recently got one from this seller (https://athometouch.com/portable-generator), and I can actually move it around by myself!

Power output is another major difference. Traditional generators typically pack more punch - they can power your whole house during outages. But here's the thing: most of us don't need that much power. My portable unit handles all my essential needs - fridge, lights, phone charging, and even my coffee maker (priorities, right?).

Let's talk fuel efficiency. Traditional generators are like hungry hippos - they guzzle fuel like crazy. Portable ones are way more efficient. Mine runs for hours on a single tank, which is super convenient during longer outages or camping trips.

Noise levels? Traditional generators sound like a truck engine running in your backyard. Modern portable generators are surprisingly quiet. My neighbors probably don't even know when I'm running mine.

Maintenance is another big factor. Traditional generators need regular servicing and can be expensive to repair. Portable generators are simpler machines with fewer parts to worry about. I've found some great options here (https://athometouch.com/portable-generator) that come with solid warranties.

Cost is probably the biggest difference. Traditional generators can set you back thousands of dollars, plus installation costs. Portable generators are much more budget-friendly, and you don't need professional installation.

Here's my practical advice: if you're not planning to power your entire house during outages, a portable generator is the way to go. They're perfect for:
- Camping trips
- Tailgating
- Emergency backup for essential appliances
- Job sites
- RV trips

The best part? You can store them easily when not in use. Mine sits quietly in my garage, ready whenever I need it.

One thing I learned: get one with wheels! Trust me, your back will thank you. Also, look for models with multiple outlets and fuel gauges - these features make life so much easier.

I've used both types extensively, and for most people, portable generators are the smarter choice. They're more practical, cost-effective, and versatile. Unless you absolutely need to power your entire house, a portable generator will serve you just fine.

Remember to always follow safety guidelines, keep them well-maintained, and never run them indoors. Stay safe, everyone!",1,1758986322.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

By trade I'm a pilot. Many ratings and thousands of hours in dozens of planes. Most recently I was in management and trained pilots. I've recently decided to go back to flying. I also have a white collar professional side-gig that I do. (Not uber eats or uber lol!!!)

I’m a divorced dad with a 12-year-old daughter, and we do the 50/50 custody thing. My ex and I actually get along (I know, shocking), and people compliment us on how drama-free it is. Honestly, you could grab a coffee with her and she’d probably give me a decent Yelp review. Joking lol (we are divorced for reason haha)

After the divorce (my idea), I did the whole “personal growth” thing. No baggage, no “crazy ex” stories—just came out the other side in a solid spot.

I’m looking for a relationship where 1+1 = 3. A partnership that’s fun, a little banter, some random adventures, and actual teamwork when it comes to building a great life. I’m easygoing, kind, adaptable, and rely way more on common sense than textbooks (though I did get the degree). 

I’ve traveled a lot (military brat perks), five continents and counting. Would love someone who’s adventurous, funny, honest, and can handle both a Bolivian mountain hike at 13,000 feet and a Netflix marathon without complaint.  Ie physically and mentally healthy and the energy and fitness for both.  

I’m an extroverted introvert; social, but I also appreciate my recharge time. Not materialistic, but thankfully not broke either. I’ve got my own place, my own car, and a solid job. My dad raised me old school: build a guitar? Done. Fix a car? Done. Random home repair? Done (eventually).

I’m not in a rush, but I’d love to find someone fun, grounded, and ready to build something strong. And yeah, long-distance isn’t my jam; so Texas ladies, you’ve got home-field advantage.

I'm the real deal. I don't have any ""gotchas"" or weird crap where I misrepresent myself and you figure it out later and go ""why did I fall for this!"" So are you ready to have a good relationship that is rarely boring, honest, has good communication, and is laughs?

I'm mostly content in the way we've set up our living room, but we still want to do some upgrades and we're starting to get stuck in analysis paralysis now because our living room is 'almost complete'... So I came here for some advice...

**Major** things i still see that could upgrade the place and would love some advice, inspiration on:

* an upgrade to the s**tanding lamp next to the tv**
* either **sconces/lamp/lamp combo** on the **mantelpiece** or a lamp on the left of it: we lack 'warm' light in the back of the living room. The problem with sconces is that while I think it's the best option for the mantelpiece, it's a rental so we can't drill and the ones with batteries seem a hassle.
* **upgrade** of the **curtains**. Right now those are very see through: people can look inside our living room and it feels too 'open' not cozy... Dark green seemed nice

Then these also come to mind but they are **not so important** to us:

* some more '**verticality**' either some shelves or a tall piece of display furniture on the left side of the window kitchen cutout
   * we think the room is already busy enough so perhaps it's just overkill
* an upgrade to the **coffee table**
   * might be nice but is not at all necessary we feel

You can still give suggestions, though :) (or roast our interior)

You either sound too pushy, too generic, or worse you get ignored completely.

That’s where I come in. Over the last few months, I’ve tested, refined, and actually used dozens of cold outreach messages for freelancers, agencies, and creators. The goal was simple: write messages that don’t feel spammy, but still get replies.

Now, I’ve put everything into one simple Cold DM Script Pack, designed for anyone who wants more clients but doesn’t want to spend hours figuring out what to say.

Here’s what you’ll get inside the pack (all for just $3.99):

15+ Proven Cold DM Scripts → Tested on Instagram, LinkedIn, and even email.

Different Angles → Scripts for pitching services, asking questions, starting conversations, or warming up leads.

Editable Frameworks → Not just copy-paste lines  flexible templates you can adapt to your niche in minutes.

Psychology-Backed Approaches → Wording that lowers resistance and actually sparks curiosity.

Why this pack?
Because most of what you find online is either free fluff that doesn’t work, or expensive courses you don’t need. This is a straight-to-the-point toolkit that you can download today and start using immediately. No upsells, no filler just practical lines that work.

Who is it for?

Freelancers → who are tired of waiting for clients to magically appear.

Creators → who want to land collabs, sponsorships, or paid partnerships.

Agencies / Small Teams → who need quick outreach without hiring a full-time setter.

Also I can customize the pack according to your needs to make it as much useful as it can be for you but 

For the price of a coffee, you’ll have an entire library of messages that can help you book calls, start conversations, and actually move closer to closing deals.

I-share ko lang yung xp ko when I went to SG this Sep!

1.	⁠Changi airport - ganda nga.. depende sa schedule mo, advisable tsaka mo na ikutin pag pabalik kang PH. Pag kakarating kasi, di mo pa maisip anong gusto mong makita hahahaha malawak sya, medyo nakakaligaw pero wag mahiya sa customer service nilang hitech, naka Tablet haha they’re so ahead of us! Bakit nga naman tatanga sa desk ung receptionists at mag aantay ng maliligaw, kung pwedeng may iba silang work then iinterrupt mo lang pag may tanong ka. So so so smart! Daming stores at photo stops sa Jewel.. yung fountain na kahit saang floor ka magpicture pwede wag makipagsiksikan sa GF.

Dami money changer. Tama sabi sa comments dito sa reddit, kapag marami ka ipapalit, wag lahat sa airport. Sa towns na yung iba mas ok ang rates. True! Saktong pang grab at 1st day gastos ko lang pinapalit ko (100usd), bawal may butal, 120 sana ipapalit ko pero puro 100 bill lang meron ako. Pinoy na pinoy may butal.

Ezlink - bumili pala ako nito sa airport nasulit ko sya kasi maraming pwede pag gamitan. Need lang rin magbudget para di sobra sobra maload mo. Madali naman rin magtop up sa 711, maliit lang charge nasa 0.60sgd yata. Ito pangbayad sa bus, train, stores, kainan.

2. Grab - mahal be. Tapos grabe fluctuate price so mahirap magbudget since cash ang need, maya’t maya ako na addjust ng itatabi kong cash hanggang pagbalik ko ng airport pag uuwi na ako. Hahah main factor yung time ng byahe mo. Pag rush hour, lakihan mo budget mo as in 2x ng normal hour! Mababait drivers, tahimik lang. puro EV! Cooooool..

3. Stayed at Changi cove - one of the closest okay hotels sa airport I assume kaya common ang pinoy doon. Be ready sa 100sgd deposit (di ko sure kung para sa lahat yun). Not recommended for tanders at ang daming lakarin bago ka makarating sa hotel area. Events building kasi yung lobby area so need mo pa tumawid via a hallway then open lanai bago sa hotel. Rooms are okay, basic lang. be ready sa outlet na type G. Inignore ko yung nababasa kong magdal ng adapter kasi 1x ko lang nabasa. Hahaha ayan tuloy napabili pa ko ng adapter. Mapapaisip karin bakit di nila iupgrade yung outlets if madala tourists ang guests. Maybe malaking gastos sya ewan ko. Nag ask ako sa reception baka pwede humiram for sure may naiwan kako yung guests nila. Aba binentahan ako ni ghurl?? 5gsd.. feeling ko may mas mura so nagtingin muna ako sa labas. Lo and behold may Mr DIY sa Merlion area nakabili ako 1.7sgd bwahahahaha!

Okay naman bfast, konti menu. Wala rice lugaw lang. pinoy yung sa omelet station haha mabait naman.

4. Commute system: Bus - google maps is your best friend. Lalo kung nakapag Japan o Taiwan kana, kaya mo na rin dito. Accurate naman yung labels at time ng stations at bus. Windang lang dito yung bus stops. May “Bef” at “Aft” nakakabit sa stop name. Magkatawiran sila sa street. So pag di mo to pinansin at nasa maling side ka, baliktad direction ng byahe mo hahaha

Sa harap ang sakay wag sa gitna. Tap card, upo, pag next stop kana, press the stop button na nasa all over the bus, tap again pagbaba.

Tip, combohan mo ng citymapper app yung Gmaps kasi mas madali tingnan don kung malapit na ba un bus stop mo. Mag aalarm kineme pa so di ka lalampas.

Tapos kung san ka bumaba, hindi ka dun sasakay uli pag uuwi kana. Ewan ko ba sa SG bakit ganun sila hahaha makakasanayan rin naman.

5. Merlion/Maria Bay Sands - okay naman daming tao for a weekday.. nasa kabilang dako ng SG pala to kala ko malapit lang sa airport side. Puro buildings na may name ng some banks na meron sa PH. BGC feels etong area lang na to. Kasi nga may Maybank, HSBC, blah blah.

6. Malls - wala silang chain SM ata or basta yung madali marecognize na “ayun mall!” Pasok pasok ka lang sa magkakatabi na buildings, mall na pala sila. May money changer sa mall mga 10mins from Merlion. Medyo boring yung feels ng malls nila.

7. Bugis - ang saya dito! Daming paninda. Sa side ng tianggehan ako napunta, hindi sa parang mall. Mura souvenirs, snacks, so 1st day ko pa lang nakabili na ko ng pasalubong, great decision since hindi ko na inisip yun the entire trip! At naspend ko na yung budget ko for pasalubong so yung budget ko ay para sa food at transpo na lang.

Meron hawker center sa dulo, unang food ko sa SG ay sa Hong Kong Soy Chicken noodles (4sgd) na stall, ang sarap nung sauce! May chicharon bits. Ang chewy nung noodles. Pak na pak talaga. Best food ko to sa entire stay ko sa SG. Sorry na maarte talaga ako sa food. Try nyo to. Daming ibang stores rin naman.

May Valudollar store, nabasa ko ok bilihan pasalubong dito so tinry ko rin. Marami ako nabili coffee at milktea sticks mura lang.


8. Changi village hawker - okay naman, marami rin stores. Fish ball soup tinry ko 5sgd, one of the recommended dish dito sa reddit. matabang, walang special. Baka doon lang sa shop na yun. Nabusog ako kaya hindi ako nakatry ng iba pa. May valudollar rin so bumili ako ng snack matry lang. 0.7sgd Rose Milk sa bottle at cookies. Yung milk ay weird para kang umiinom ng perfume na matamis at milky hahaha why SG why

9. Penarakan Houses - di ko to planado, I researched originally na for my last night na gala, Chinatown, Little India, or Haji Lane ang options ko. Kaso pagtingin ko sa maps, dun ulit sya sa Bugis area. So napaisip ako maibang area naman. Nasearch ko itong Joo Chiat road. And woaaaaaa malupet ang ganda. Buti ito ang pinuntahan ko. Para akong nasa ibang era. Time stood still or nasa fiction book ganun. Google nyo.. dalawin nyo na rin pag mag SG kayo. Unique and very unique place! 

May hawker uli sa kabilang street ng Pena. Houses. 6pm pa lang nun pero parang sarado na mga stores, may naiwan isa sa basement e gutom na ko laban na yun. Tagal ko nakatitig sa menu kasi di ako makapili. Sinabihan na ko nung owner or cook siguro “Just choose any and I will cook good for you” di ko lang masabi walang problem dun, maarte lang talaga ko sa food haha I settled sa seafood fried rice 6sgd. Masarap! Dere deretso kain naubos ko naman. Try nyo rin dun.

Overall, masaya naman. Busog mata magobserve sa discipline ng mga tao, sa napaka safe na lugar, wala ko nakitang barker, sekyu, pulis, or MMDA hahaha di nila need! Basic housing sa kanila ay condo/apartment buildings. ang detached houses ay malalaki, pang mayaman. Yung condos ay as in along their main highways, accessible ng train/bus stations. Amazing ng transpo system nila. Wala kong nakita na naka motor. Di siguro nila need. Meron mga nagbbike, pwede sila sa hiway pwede rin sa sidewalk kasabay ng mga tao. May discipline nga kasi so safe talaga.

Convenient mag ikot ikot. Sa nagsasabing super init at humid, same na same lang sa PH. Di pa mausok dun. Need ng budget talaga kasi pricey ang food. Babalik ba ako? Baka hindi na. Siguro kung all expense paid, pwede pa haha senior friendly? If may budget pang grab, pwede!

I’d heard a lot about this stain remover, and with its promise of being powered by 97% plant-based ingredients, I couldn’t resist giving it a try.

**User-Friendly Design**  
The design of the bottle is super convenient, making it straightforward to handle during chaotic laundry sessions. The nozzle delivers a consistent spray, allowing even coverage over targeted stains. It’s lightweight, which means I can tote it around easily, whether I’m treating a spot on the couch or pre-treating a shirt. I appreciate how the bottle feels sturdy and doesn’t leak, even when shaken. Sometimes, it’s the little things that count.

**Performance in Action**  
What stands out the most about this stain remover is the quadruple-enzyme formula. I sprayed it on a week-old coffee stain on a light-colored blouse. After letting it sit for about ten minutes (I was skeptical it would work on older stains), I tossed the blouse into the washer with my usual detergent. To my surprise, the blouse came out spotless. It works wonders on fresh stains too—my kids’ grass-streaked jeans and my partner’s spaghetti-splattered T-shirt were no match for it. Its ability to handle both protein-based and oil-based stains is genuinely impressive.

**Good Points**  
- The plant-based, biobased formulation is kind to clothes and the environment.  
- Efficient against both fresh and set-in stains like coffee, ketchup, and grass.  
- Contains no dyes or artificial fragrances, making it suitable for sensitive noses.

**What About the Scent?**  
If you’re anything like me, the scent of laundry products can make or break the experience. The fact that this solution is free from artificial fragrances is a major win. There’s a subtle, natural scent to it, which fades completely after washing. This makes it a great choice for anyone who prefers their laundry products neutral or has sensitivities to strong perfumes.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The spray bottle, while functional, could be improved for precision on smaller stains.  
- Can't be used on all fabric types—some delicate materials require caution.  

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other stain removers on the market, this one stands out for its eco-friendly formula. Popular brands like OxiClean offer effective stain treatment but often use more chemicals and synthetic ingredients. While OxiClean can tackle tough stains almost instantly, this stain remover from Seventh Generation provides peace of mind for those who are eco-conscious. On the other hand, Shout is another contender specializing in pre-treatment, but it lacks the plant-based, environmentally friendly appeal. I’d say this product strikes a balance between being tough on stains and kind to the planet.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Given its performance and the additional peace of mind from using an environmentally friendly product, I’d say it’s worth the investment. Sure, some heavily marketed competitors may bring faster results in certain scenarios, but for day-to-day household laundry, this stain remover strikes an excellent balance between cost and quality. The added bonus of clear ingredient labeling and being cruelty-free makes it a standout choice that aligns with ethical values.

1nrxh93,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1nrxh93/losing_my_mind/,losing my mind,"first time im writing about my retroactive jealousy .. I feel like I’m losing my mind

I met my husband a few years ago. He’s a vet. In the beginning it was nothing special, just friendly when I saw him. Later when my animal got very sick I had to go to his clinic more often and after about 3 years of on and off contact we started talking more because we spent hours together. I really liked him. Then it was obvious he liked me too. He asked me out for coffee a few times, I said no because I wasn’t ready. A few months later I gave it a chance.

Our first dinner was amazing. We didn’t even hug or flirt, we talked about so much and laughed a lot. after it, he just took me home. Not many men have respected me like this and he still has this character. Hes soft and very considerate. After a few more dates we had our first kiss and I was falling for him unlike anything i experienced begfore. we started dating.

Naturally when you date you ask about the past. He told me he had never been married before, he just had a fwb before me. He also said from the second he saw me he knew he’d marry me. He did everything to be with me, thoughtful gifts, cute jokes and always reminding the small things about me but always respected my pace. Then, After a year (with lots of getting to know eavhother) we got married. For Europeans that might sound fast, but I’m a revert to Islam, and for Muslim couples it’s actually considered quite late. Our wedding was small but really special.

Then it all started going wrong for me.

One night I had this feeling to check his phone. I wish I never did. I read old texts between him and a colleague where he said that he had asked the woman he was with before me. the fwb ( she was 51 at the time, he was 30 ) to marry him as a first wife with the exception that he take a younger second wife to have kids. He was so emotional in those texts and wrote that he realized he loved her because she never refused sex, cooked for him, lived with him, didn’t argue. Then after I found all their breakup messages. She told him she’d have kids with him whatever it takes, and see doctors to make it work,and then she said she wants to be his only one or that he should marry first and she’d decide later. Then silence, blocked.

Those texts were from two weeks before our first dinner date..... 😭

And what he had told me before was just a “friends with benefits” was actually a three year, committed, exclusive relationship. He ended it the same week he started dating me.

When I asked him, he said it was already over, he assured me that this is in the past and he was emotional and crazy from overthinking, but he doesnt think of ever reconnecting with her. he said that he didn’t say “I love you” until the very end to her. But I’ve been spiraling ever since. I feel like he just wanted a wife, not me. He is my first husband and i felt so special but i feel broken down. He told two women in the same month that he wanted to marry them. nothing feels special anymore.

The hard part is, he treats me so well. He was serious about me from the start. I was the first girl he ever introduced to his family. He spoils me, he listens, he cares. He keeps saying the past is the past. But my brain won’t stop. I keep digging, asking, connecting dots, comparing myself to her. I’m depressed, I struggle to even cook or clean, and I fight with him all the time. I put her on a pedestal in my head — older, experienced, lived with him, cooked, even helped him in surgeries and learned to speak english fluently so they could talk together. Also she did nothing wrong and all I do is piss off my husband lately with this mess.. And I feel like I’ll never measure up.

It got worse recently. The latest fight revealed that the son of the 51yo woman brought her dog into the clinic in a critical state. My husband didn’t tell me until two weeks later even though he usually tells me about his critical cases. I lost it. I accused him, I said horrible things like “don’t you get memories of her when you see her son, since you got introduced to him as his new dad, and didn’t you fuck that 51 year old cougar in the clinic?” He lost it to and said ""yes, they did have sex there, and she would give me blowjobs, because she spent so much time with him. and she was his girlfriend"" He said sorry for being honest but that just broke me even more.

Now I feel like I’m falling apart. I can’t stop obsessing, comparing, spiraling. what does he mean ""girlfriend""? i thought they were nothing serious.. He tells me he chose me, that he loves me, that it’s all in the past. But I can’t get rid of the images in my head. I feel like I’m living in her shadow.

Also i am mentally stable but when life gets stressful i cannot cope. its not been diagnosed but i obsess and have like extreme extreme outbursts of sadness/rage at times when i think of this. And my words are sharp like a knife. im just so hurt.

I don’t know how to stop this before it ruins my marriage. It did happen all before me and hes loyal to me since we started dating. His intentions are not to get back to her but my trust is so broken. Has anyone else dealt with retroactive jealousy this extreme? How do you actually make it stop?

I’ve been reading *Your Brain on Auto-Pilot: Why You Keep Doing What You Hate - and How to Finally Stop* and it hit me harder than my third espresso. The idea is that a lot of our “bad habits” aren’t about laziness or lack of discipline - they’re unconscious loops your brain runs the second it feels stressed, bored, or overwhelmed.

The wild part? Once you can spot the loop starting, you can actually break it. The book gives little experiments (like changing a micro-action in your routine) that make it way harder for autopilot to kick in.

Bat Hat Minnie's skill at max level randomly distributes 10 bats that you can tap to clear, exploding the tsums underneath and making bubbles if you clear 7 or more tsums. According to the coin ranking website, there are [three](https://0-bdka7fb-jp.translate.goog/47194.html?_x_tr_enc=0&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) different major strategies how to use BHM's skill at max level. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy3tuy_BqBQ) one seems to be the most effective for earning coins and involves clearing in a ""hexagram"" style. There's a handy picture of the ""hexagram zones"" on that linked website you can check out if the video does not make it clear (it didn't for me!). Baseball Pooh is above average with good timing skills. Elizabeth Swan can be good for long chain missions but is filler for coins. Rattle Bones Pluto rare event tsum but filler for coins. Merida, Pumpkin Mickey, and Yen Sid are all filler.

**Capsule Two** - Periwinkle and Photographer Dumbo are above average. Lilo is a rare event tsum but filler for coins. Dumbo, Festival Donald, King Triton, and Tiana are all filler.

**Select Box One** - Jack & Sally is a top 20 tsum. This pair tsum is an amazing target for new players as you can earn a lot of coins even at skill levels 1-3. Jack’s skill charges fast and is a random burst clear. Sally’s skill is a Namine style clear that connects across distance and bursts away nearby tsums. When you use Sally’s skill then Jack’s afterwards, it does Jack’s random burst first, then clears all Sally/Jack tsums and their surrounding tsums on the board afterwards, and then you still have Sally’s skill for the remainder of the time. Jack’s skill can be used whenever but always aim to use Sally when Jack is available, too. Cat Hat Minnie is good for long chain missions but filler for coins. Horn Hat Mickey is filler for coins but you can use his movable bubbles to target specific areas for boss fight missions or collecting missions. Lock can be good for MyTsum missions but is filler for coins. Mummy Donald can be good for large tsum and long chain missions but filler for coins. Bolt-head Goofy, Jack Skellington, Ghost Dale, Halloween Sora, Pumpkin Chip, Sally, and Zero are all filler.

**Select Box Two** - Masquerade Lady Tremaine is a fever starting top 75 coin efficient tsum when using gyro. Her skill starts with a diagonal burst and then transforms tsums that you then chain together. Mischievous Jack and Pumpkin King are above average. Asha is above average but complicated. Masquerade Evil Queen is above average and also starts fever times. Masquerade Esmeralda and Masquerade Hades start fever times but are filler for coins. Thumper is good for skill activation missions but is filler for coins. Nala, Pascal, Tinker Bell and Vampire Teddy Bear are all filler.

**Select Box Three** - Night Chernabog is a top 20 tsum it is a really, really challenging tsum. When you use the skill it reduces the board to 2 tsums and you want to first connect the evil spirits to make flames, and then make a chain with Chernabog to pop the flames. It’s sort of a hybrid between Angel’s skill and the Maleficent-style clearers. Probably not great for most players. Classic Maleficent is a top 50 coin efficient Maleficent-style clearer. Evil Queen & Magic Mirror is a top 50 coin efficient pair tsum with a modified Maleficent-style play because of the pair tsum aspect. Lucifer is above average. Masquerade Cinderella and Masquerade Meg start fever times but are filler for coins. Big Bad Wolf, Coffee Cup Goofy, Lady, Scar, Shere Khan, and White Rabbit are all filler.

**Overall Review** - What an exciting month! Bat Hat Minnie, Night Chernabog, Jack & Sally, and the Monsters Inc Set tsum are all top tsums that play so differently than each other it’s hard to pick an overall best but Bat Hat Minnie only taking 3 copies to max and her fast games marginally edge out the others for most players. She relies on speed and pattern recognition but she deserves maxing out in just about everyone’s collections given the chance. If you are on a really limited coin budget make sure to save for Bat Hat Minnie’s capsule. Best bang for your buck in the game. 

Jack & Sally starts off strong for fast players and could be a great target for new players, as well. The Set tsum is going to have the default low 2% odds, and after last month’s Duffy event, many of us are going to be struggling to have enough coins on hand to get a copy. It might be better to save those coins for the first select box and try for Jack & Sally instead with much greater odds and a ton of other useful or rare tsums in the same box anyway. We are lucky to get an influx of old and rare tsums this month that may not come around until next Halloween at the earliest so trying to manage your coins and pulling a copy of each like Jack Skellington, Halloween Sora, and tsums like them should be a priority for collection completionists. This is going to be an expensive month for just about every one of us here. Good luck and Happy Halloween!",14,1758984965.0,TsumTsum,1,1.0,False

I've been on a wild ride lately and wanted to share something that's been a game-changer for my online store. Just two weeks ago, I started using this innovative tool, HypeCaster. It's an AI-driven video creator that crafts engaging UGC ads and short-form video content for platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and even TikTok Shop. Say goodbye to those long editing hours!

I've primarily been using Reddit as my marketing hub, and the results have been surprisingly effective. The process is ridiculously simple: upload a single product photo, choose your style, and in less time than it takes to make a coffee, you've got a captivating ad video complete with captions and hooks.

I launched this approach a mere 14 days ago and the results have been astounding. Today, I've already seen over 5,000 visitors land on my site, and I've hit the $200 revenue mark, something I couldn't have imagined happening so soon.

What impresses me the most is the level of content consistency I can maintain without the usual stress. It's been a breeze keeping my social media channels fresh and engaging, thanks to HypeCaster.

If you're striving for growth, I'd highly recommend exploring automated video creation. Having this tool in your corner can make all the difference for your eCommerce venture. Cheers to scaling together!",1,1758984772.0,ecommerce_growth,0,1.0,False

I recently broke up with my ex after several problems, but what really broke me was finding a deleted message from her boss. He had written something like: ""It's been a while, can I go get coffee on Thursday or Monday?"" The thing is, before being with me, she had already had a thing with that boss about getting a position at the company where we both work. And she told me that the boss was bothering her. I saw several messages saying hello and she didn't respond, or I don't know.



When I found that message, I asked her not to delete it anymore... but she kept deleting. This generated tremendous anxiety in me: I became obsessed, persistent, and very distrustful and toxic. I never got a clear answer. She swears she never cheated on me, but I feel like simply deleting messages breaks the trust. I have mixed feelings: on one hand, I miss her; on the other, I know if I get back together, I'll always distrust her. I'm unmotivated, anxious, and the worst part is that we work at the same company, so I can't avoid seeing her or the boss.



Edit: I used to leave bloody underwear for my mom to wash; her family would come over, she wouldn't clean up, she'd just leave everything like that. She was a very deceitful person, lying to you about absolutely everything. She went into debt for $4,000 (USD). I took out a loan to help her, and on top of that, she says she went into debt because of me.",2,1758984764.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

I’m rolling with a low-scoring affair here, friends. The Under has cashed in 5 of Wake Forest’s last 6 outings, and despite my expectation that Georgia Tech does a majority of the scoring, I think the weather will do a nice job of slowing this encounter down (rain with a lightning bolt on the forecast is never a good sign…). That said, I do think Wake Forest has a decent enough defense to keep Georgia Tech from running away with this game too quickly – I’m on the final score to fall Under 52.5.

He asked me out for this weekend and said he would plan it. The following is what he proposed:

“Does Sunday early afternoon work for you? There’s a park along the [river name in our city] with some trails I’ve been meaning to check out, and a coffee spot by the water. Figured we could walk, grab coffee, and if we’re hungry after there are a few lunch spots around too.”

Do we think this is not great for a first meeting and date? The trails he is suggesting is public so it’s not like it’s in the mountains or anything, but they always say a nice public place for a first meeting is best so I’m not sure. I’ve gotten no red flags from him so far and he seems totally pleasant. I could go and multiple friends have my location, but potentially not worth the risk?

Don't use AI, yeah, AT ALL COSTS.

I'll tell you what.

AI doesn't get context.

It doesn't feel, nor possess the nuance to tell you how to make your scene emotionally charged. (It's like asking your fridge to heat your coffee).

It doesnt know subtext (Only on the superficial one).

It does not help you be a better writer, it only creates a delusion your good while that tool sanitizes your work and calls it ""depth"".

The content in your story? Gone in the shadow realm. The bones of your plot? Burned. It strips away everything and labels it as ""jarring"", ""ambiguous"" and that goes for the dialogues too. It always forces you to follow a certain cliched trope.

In my experience, I remember setting a strict prompt to NOT touch my manuscript, guess what? It edited and injected it ""ideas"" anyways and masked it as ""observations"".

And remember guys, you can't get something out of something that doesn't have a soul.

1nrwvlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1nrwvlh/ghosted_by_newly_open_to_work_recruiters/,Ghosted by newly “open to work” recruiters 👻,"I’ve never had such a feeling of “schadenfreude” as I did the other day.

I genuinely hate seeing others lose their jobs because I know what is coming for them but yet… there is something about these recruiters on their high horses who have had the tables turned just enough.  

…See, there is this major coffee chain that is laying off even more people and closing hundreds of stores that interviewed me for a corporate job not too long ago. Two rounds to be accurate. 

The HR recruiter I messaged and tried to connect with on LinkedIn and one of my interviewers who told me “if you need anything else just let me know,” and then never replied to several very professional follow-up emails — both have the “open to work” LinkedIn banner, current role end date of September 2025, and their, “it’s been a journey working for Starbucks… blah blah blah” on their LinkedIn pages. 

“If you’d like to catch up, send me a message”… funny, it seemed like your message system wasn’t working a few months ago. I can accept I wasn’t the right person for the particular role but then to be treated like shit and not get responses after we spent hours talking and video conferencing… wow, that’s just something else. It’s the new norm but it’s not okay and isn’t acceptable. 

People excuse this behavior; “We have so many candidates it’s impossible t….”

Stfu. You had the means to message me when I applied, sent me a thank-you note when you had a clarifying question about my application. But post interview, you don’t need me to be a number for you and you treated me that way. 

My vindictive side couldn’t be happier for (some) of these people. But “keep the faith” and maybe you can “get your foot in the door” somewhere else and “anyone would be lucky to have you” because your corporate daddy just treated you like you treated me.

1nrwvk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nrwvk8/explore_best_espresso_machine_lertin_em615_does/,Explore Best Espresso Machine LERTIN EM615 Does It Live Up to Hype,"Unboxing the LERTIN EM615 espresso machine was an exciting moment for me as a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast. This sleek, stainless-steel coffee maker immediately felt like a solid addition to my kitchen setup with its compact build and modern design. What stood out initially was its promise of professional-quality espresso drinks from the comfort of home—a challenge I was eager to put to the test. With features like an LED touch screen, a milk frother, and a removable 61oz water tank, this machine seemed designed to cater to both convenience and versatility.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design of the espresso maker feels perfect for my small kitchen. Measuring a modest 7.83""D x 10.51""W x 10.86""H, it fits snugly in a corner without hogging counter space. Its stainless-steel finish adds a premium vibe, and I couldn’t help but appreciate how easy it is to keep clean from splashes or spills. The removable water tank is transparent, so I can clearly see when it’s time for a refill, and the red buoy inside acts as a gentle nudge whenever the water level gets too high. This thoughtful design makes it practical for busy mornings when I need coffee on the go.

**Ease of Use with Smart Touch Technology**  
What caught my attention quickly was the espresso machine’s LED touch screen. With just a few taps, I could choose between brewing a single or double cup of espresso. It becomes especially useful for groggy mornings when I can't think straight! I found the user interface intuitive, and there’s an energy-saving feature that automatically shuts the machine down after 20 minutes of inactivity—a bonus for anyone seeking energy efficiency without constant monitoring.

**Grab the best deal on the LERTIN EM615 on [Amazon here](https://raifords.com/p/b0djt5pzt4/).**  

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
The 20-bar professional Italian pump is the engine behind this coffee maker, and it delivers. When I tested both single and double shots, the espresso extraction was consistent, with that amazing crema every coffee lover dreams of. It’s powered by a robust 1200W boiler that ensures quick preparation while maintaining the richness of the coffee flavor. One highlight is the built-in NTC sensor. It automatically adjusts the water temperature during the brewing process to balance acidity and enhance the taste. Small touches like letting you preheat your cup on the machine is another thoughtful feature that ensures a better, fuller coffee experience.

**Milk Frothing Done Right**  
If you’re into specialty drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, or macchiatos, the milk frothing system is a game-changer. The frother produces dense, creamy microfoam, and the steam wand’s adjustable nozzle adds flexibility to create just the right texture. I also like that I can use the wand for other things, like preparing hot water for tea. It’s easy to clean and feels practical for someone who doesn’t want complicated maintenance routines. While making my morning cappuccino, the cleanup of the wand after use was quick, which made the experience seamless.

**Strengths**  
• Compact design fits easily in small spaces.  
• Professional-grade 20-bar pressure system for rich coffee flavor.  
• Milk frother creates barista-quality foam.  
• Energy-efficient with auto-shutoff feature.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
• Beginners might struggle with the frothing technique at first.  
• The machine can feel a bit loud during operation.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other semi-automatic espresso machines I’ve used, like the Breville Bambino Plus or DeLonghi Dedica, the LERTIN EM615 holds its ground well. It’s more budget-friendly than the Bambino Plus, which requires a larger upfront investment, but might not feel as refined in terms of build quality. Against the DeLonghi Dedica, this machine has a larger water tank, which is crucial for brewing multiple cups without constant refills. However, the Dedica is slightly quieter when frothing milk. That said, this coffee maker blends functionality with affordability in a way that balances expectations.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its features—the milk frother, LED screen, and 20-bar Italian pump—it delivers exceptional performance at a price point that’s accessible for home users. It bridges the gap between high-end coffee machines and entry-level budget appliances. I can confidently say that it offers strong value for money if you’re seeking a machine that doesn’t compromise on coffee quality while remaining user-friendly.

Spent 9 nights at Serotel Suites near Poissonniere metro and would recommend. Good location and a reasonably spacious little apartment. Suited us to pay for more than just a hotel room due to the length of our stay.

Arrived on Friday 19 and couldn’t check in for several hours so dropped my bags and wandered. Ended up at Notre Dame where I sat in the grandstand opposite and enjoyed the sun and the view. Wandered over to the Left Bank and Ile St Louis where I had a coffee. Wandered over towards Bastille and into the Marais, had a galette at Suzette near Place des Vosges. Finally was time to check in so made my way back to Poissoniere. For apero and dinner walked up to Brasserie Bellanger which was very good- filled with Parisians having dinner. Even with jet lag I made it til 9:30 which I was pretty impressed with!

Saturday we went to Musee Carnavalet for some history. Then wandered around Le Marais. Met some work colleagues for dinner near Saint-Michele which was touristy but reasonably priced and decent food.

Sunday we went down to Montparnasse which was a great day. Walked through the cemetery, saw Simone de Bouvoir’s house and went to the Giacometti Institute. Had a great lunch at Maison Edgar before carrying on to Musee Bourdelle which I would HIGHLY recommend- a very informative museum and not over crowded, just a lovely visit. The clouds cleared so we went over to Tour Montparnasse for the views which were great. Then made our way to Pont Neuf for a cruise along the Seine. Ended the night with Korean food at Bistrot Mee near Pyramides.

Monday we had 9 am tickets to the Louvre. Got there at 8:45 and waited in line for about 25 minutes before making it inside. Spent 6 hours there!!! Afterwards I was too exhausted to function so we had Vietnamese across the street from our hotel and went to bed early.

Tuesday we had 9:30 tour of Notre Dame, booked through Get Your Guide. Was beautiful inside. Afterwards ended up going to the Pantheon which I would highly recommend. Didn’t have a ticket but only waited about 10 minutes to get inside. Beautiful and very different architecture to ND. The crypt was very interesting. Had a brilliant lunch nearby at Cafe de la Nouvelle Marie. Then my husband wanted to go to Shakespeare and Co which also had a line to get in - by this point in the trip I was already over the lines! Had a drink in the evening at Planche before going to Bistrot Rougemont for dinner. Very Parisian, good venue.

Wednesday had a quiet morning and then went to Musee Picasso which was excellent. Had a light lunch nearby at Causeries Paris, then wandered around Le Marais some more, went to BHV, etc. Had dinner at Moon Fusion in the 9th which calls itself Italian/Japanese fusion but seemed mostly like Japanese food to me.

Thursday we had another quiet morning. Intended to go to Musee l’Orangerie but didn’t quite get the timing right so went on to lunch at Les Antiquaires. Food was good but the place was full of tourists and I thought overpriced. Had 2 pm tickets to Musee d’Orsay, spent about 4 hours there.
Met some friends for wine tasting at Comptoir Les Elixirs in Saint-Germain. A fabulous cave with 2 incredible sommeliers. Went back to Poissonniere for dinner at Richer (just ok).

Friday tried again at l’Orangerie. Got there around 12 and waited maybe 20 minutes to get in. Afterwards wandered up near Place Vendome and had a nice lunch at Cafe Alice. I had wanted to visit Palais Garnier but they were closed, so went to Galeries Lafayette instead. Then had dinner at Mova in the 17th which has a 4 or 6 course degustation and we found it in the Bib Gourmand listing. Very good value for money. Did the 4 course plus cheese and was too full!

Saturday (today!) our last day. Went to Musee Rodin which was brilliant. Highly pleasant experience (much like Musee Bourdelle, not over crowded). Had lunch over near Saint Germain and then went back to Comptoir des Elixirs to buy some wine to take home with us.

1nrwv8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nrwv8v/what_types_of_coffee_grinders_are_there/,What types of coffee grinders are there?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been diving deep into the world of coffee grinding lately, and I thought I'd share what I've learned about different types of grinders. Trust me, the right grinder can make a huge difference in your morning brew.

Let me break down the main types I've encountered:

Manual (Hand) Grinders:
These are my go-to for camping trips. They're portable, affordable, and surprisingly effective. You'll get your arm workout in, but the control over grinding is impressive. Plus, there's something therapeutic about hand-grinding your beans.

Blade Grinders:
Think of these as the entry-level electric grinders. They use spinning blades (like a blender) to chop up beans. While they're budget-friendly, they can be inconsistent with grind size. I started with one of these before upgrading.

Burr Grinders:
Now we're talking serious coffee business. These come in two types:

Flat Burr: Two parallel rings with teeth that crush beans to a consistent size. I recently picked up a fantastic flat burr grinder from https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder and it's been a game-changer for my espresso.

Conical Burr: These use a cone-shaped burr inside a ring. They're generally quieter and produce less heat, which is great for preserving coffee oils.

Electric vs. Manual:
Electric grinders are convenient but can be noisy. Manual ones are quiet but require effort. I use both - electric for daily use, manual when I don't want to wake up my roommate at 6 AM.

Speaking of options, I've found some really good deals on grinders at https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. The selection there helped me understand what features matter most for different brewing methods.

Price Points:
- Budget ($20-50): Basic blade grinders
- Mid-range ($50-200): Quality manual and entry-level burr grinders
- High-end ($200+): Professional-grade burr grinders

My personal take? If you're serious about coffee, invest in a burr grinder. The consistency makes a huge difference in extraction and ultimately taste. Start with something in your comfort zone - you can always upgrade later like I did.

Remember, the best grinder is one that fits your brewing style and budget. Don't feel pressured to go all-in on an expensive model right away. I started basic and worked my way up as my coffee journey evolved.

Looking for experiences, reviews, opinions","I've been considering trying No Doz caffeine pills as a cheaper alternative to pre-workouts and fat burners. Each pill has 200mg of caffeine which seems like a solid dose for both alertness and potentially helping with weight loss through appetite suppression.
I'm mainly interested in using them for morning energy since I'm not a coffee person, pre-workout energy without all the extra ingredients in typical PWOs, appetite control during my cut, and general alertness during long work days.
For anyone who's used No Doz, I'm curious how the energy compares to coffee or energy drinks and whether you experienced any crashes. Did you notice appetite suppression effects or any jitters at the 200mg dose?  
Would it be better if I stick to dedicated fat burners or these caffeine pills are the real deal?  
I usually have a decent caffeine tolerance (drink about 2-3 cups of coffee daily), so I think 200mg should be manageable. Just want to hear from people who've actually used them rather than guessing based on the label.
Also curious if anyone has compared No Doz to other generic caffeine pills or if the brand actually makes a difference.",2,1758983419.0,NoFriendsFriendsClub,0,1.0,False
1nrwo87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nrwo87,How much was your Hawaii Vacation (17 days in June-July 2025 & all islands)?,"
My partner and I love to travel but often find it hard to estimate trip costs, so I wanted to share every detail of our trip and cost of everything to give other people better references on trip costs. We are mid-budget travelers where we cheap out on some items and splurge on excursions we really want to do. 

Items we cheap out on to make sure the small costs don’t add up: 
- No checked luggage
- We did our best to buy travel size sunscreen in the states so we did not pay island prices
- We bought 30 piece of chickfila nuggets on the way to the airport and kept in a small collapsible cooler bag. This helped eliminate 1-2 days of meat/ snacks
- We used our airbnbs for kitchens and laundry (no additional charges as we made sure this was included with some of our rentals). FYI we booked most airbnbs in Jan/ Feb before the good options got booked out!
- We used paper towels from Airbnb or relied on rain to wipe/wash down rental car before we returned them to Budget. Therefore, no money spent on car washes!

In summary, we went to ALL islands of Hawaii (including Lanai) and roadtripped every side of each island for 17 days in late June to mid July. 

We support local as much as we can and avoid the big name, tourists hotels. Therefore, we stayed in airbnbs and had our own rental car for every island. The airbnbs were full houses to ourselves, as we would never book a shared room/ shared house rental. 

We had a fair share of eating out and dining. We had 2 big, costly excursions: full day boat ride with snorkeling on the Napoli coast and a helicopter ride on the big island where we saw the lava explosions. 

- Tip: I have been to a luau show hosted by Marriot/ Hilton in a long time ago and recalled the food being mid. For this trip, the price wasn’t worth the luau show for us they were asking for $500/ per person for the show and 1 dinner meal (we are not big on drinking alcohol too). We looked on reddit and yelp and found remarkable local hawaiian food (cheaper too!) that was way better than what they feed you at the luau. 

So, we were in Maui for July 4 and the locals told us to go to the Grand Waimea for free fireworks. We did and ended up getting to see part of the luau show for free (on the back side of the stage, obviously we did not pay for seating). I recommend arriving to fireworks early for a chance to see the entire show for free. Pickup local hawaiian food to-go and bring it to the Grand Waimea for a way cheaper luau version that isn’t overpriced with crappy food provided by the corporate hotels!

Total costs: Female partner spent $5,913.06 and male partner spent $6,207.64. 

All costs were split 50/50 except for dining/ groceries and individual shopping. We split those specific bills by our own consumption. As such, the male partner spent slightly more due to preference of dining out more.

Thanks for your Help!!!

Hello everyone,

I recently purchased the Cafelat Robot Barista. My grinder is a Eureka Mignon XL.

Despite a fine grind (zero point is set correctly and grinder is at its limit), I get little (!) resistance on the robot arms. The pressure gauge also shows very little pressure (remains below 2 bar).

https://preview.redd.it/jqdxs0qovprf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cd4f7507457e5c79efceeb972637a58d953fe68



My recipe is 60g of water to 17g of ground coffee, with an output of 38g. After a few runs, the taste was quite good, but there was little resistance/pressure build-up and therefore no real espresso.

Then I used a little more – 65g of water to 19g of coffee. Still too little resistance, hardly any change.

I tamped (as it should be, without too much pressure) and pressed down lightly on the Robot's filter.



Overall, the extraction doesn't run smoothly for quite a long time in the outer area, and only in the second half does the coffee run in the middle.



Possible causes I had read about would be a defective seal (perhaps during transport).

With such a fine grind, there should actually be some resistance. It's not a small amount of coffee, and the beans are still within the normal range (freshly opened, dark roast from Good Karma, 6 weeks after the roast date).



I would be grateful for any ideas! I have attached a photo of the ground coffee; I hope that helps.",1,1758983084.0,CafelatRobot,8,0.67,False

I decided to go home because I felt truly awful.. I thought maybe I was getting sick because I felt so bad. Well I started to wonder if maybe the drink had dairy in it.

OK well I was pissed because 10 years is a long time and I've always had issues with dairy.. I told him my favorite drink is a oatmilk vanilla matcha because it's dairy free and the caffeine doesn't give me anxiety..

I was frustrated because he didn't listen.. and we got into a big argument about me being ungrateful.

We got home in the early hours and went straight to bed. This morning, around 11:00, we discovered her purse was missing from her bag. We searched everywhere but couldn’t find it.

She definitely had the purse at the start of the flight because we bought coffee, so thinking logically it must have fallen out of her bag and ended up on the cabin floor. That was our optimistic view. Then she checked her accounts and discovered one of the cards had been used in a Tesco store at 6:32 in south London. 

Now I’m pissed, not about the £35, but because the purse was clearly stolen. We have cancelled all the cards and contacted the police because her driving licence was inside the purse too.

Cancelling cards and replacing ID is straightforward, but the situation bothers me. Could someone have gone through her bag while we were asleep? We were in the very back row, my partner was in the middle seat and the seat beside her was empty. Maybe some opportunistic passenger, which I could accept, but I am more concerned about the staff. This was the last flight into Gatwick, so the aircraft was presumably cleaned afterwards. If the purse fell out and was left on the floor or in the seat pocket, surely the cleaner or another staff member would have needed to hand it in? 

Anyways I’m waffling on. I do not expect much will come of the police report. The £35 is already being refunded and it is not the biggest crime, but I am wondering about next steps. Can I request CCTV footage from the Tesco myself and share it with the airline to see whether the card use was by a member of staff or a passenger? If not me, could a private investigator access the CCTV and the information needed? I realise it might be extreme for a stolen purse that has already been dealt with, but I am off next week and I do not mind spending a bit of time and money to find out who took the purse.

As far back as I can remember, I’ve always struggled with **anxiety**, **emetophobia**, and (probably) **R-CPD**.

# 🌀 How it started

My emetophobia began around age 10–12, after one night when I unexpectedly vomited. I remember feeling shocked and ashamed. From that moment, my brain went into “prevention mode”:

* Germs? → No contact between hands and mouth.
* Food? → Stick to what I know, avoid seafood and risky dishes.
* Motion sickness? → No rollercoasters, boats, fast rides.
* Substances? → No drugs, no alcohol.
* Food again? → Sometimes, I’d just avoid eating altogether.

Therapy didn’t help much back then. It felt like I was living in constant alert, afraid of being afraid.

# 🌬 R-CPD enters the picture

At 18, after a dinner and a coffee, I felt air trapped in my chest for the first time. It terrified me because it was unfamiliar, and I thought I might vomit. Over time, I learned to live with my three “demons”: anxiety, emetophobia, and R-CPD.

Some days are fine and I feel almost “normal.” Other days, I stay home, waiting for the storm to pass — but I never give up.

# 🔎 Discovering R-CPD

A few years ago, I googled *“no burp, weird noises”* and found information about R-CPD. Everything clicked. I’m 32 now, and for a long time I thought: “I’ve lived with this forever, I can keep going.”

The social side of R-CPD never bothered me too much — the noises are subtle. Sometimes people say “You know you can just burp, right? lol” but that’s it.

# ⚡ When everything exploded

Recently, I went through huge life changes:

* I quit my job
* Moved back to France
* Started learning new things
* Faced a lot of stressful events

My anxiety spiked, and my R-CPD symptoms exploded too. I stopped eating out of fear, lost too much weight, and realized: *I can’t keep going like this.*

# 🏥 The medical journey

Getting help in France has been tough. Many doctors didn’t take me seriously. Eventually, I saw a gastroenterologist:

* 1 month ago: fibroscopy (to rule out other issues — useless for R-CPD)
* This Monday: manometry with sparkling water (to confirm diagnosis)
* February: Botox injection scheduled (earliest available)

# 🌤 Where I’m at now

Life is actually looking up. I have a job I like, a nice apartment, and a loving family. But every single day, I wake up and immediately do a “body scan,” checking for sensations and thinking *“I hope today is fine… what if… and if…”*.

As an engineer, I try to “solve” this logically. I genuinely believe that years of tension and fear may have caused me to physically block any air from escaping upwards. So I wonder: **is my R-CPD self-inflicted?**

I’ve read about possible side effects of Botox, and part of me fears that forcing my body to burp might trigger my anxiety even more. But maybe it’s the opposite — maybe it will free me mentally.

# ❓ My big question

Do I have anxiety **because** my body is different (and I feel sensations others don’t)?  
**Or** is my R-CPD **caused by my anxiety**, and fixing the anxiety is the real key?

I’d love to hear from people who have experienced similar things — or who have had the Botox treatment. Did it help your anxiety? Did it change how you experience your body?

Even without caffeine it's extremely satisfying to have something with a strong flavor to wake me up.

Anyway, now I just don't know what to drink! For those who want to suggest herbal tea, I'm the biggest tea fan out there, but I don't enjoy herbal tea in the morning very much because it's not strong. It's meant to be very light. I love that in the evenings once I've already had all three meals and I want to relax and be calm, but not in the morning before I've seen any of the action yet. Milk and orange juice are good with some breakfasts but they're not hot so they still don't capture the black tea/coffee essence. So is there anything strong, hot, and caffeineless that I can drink?

1nrwckl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1nrwckl/when_a_friend_with_bpd_makes_you_part_of_their/,When a friend with BPD makes you part of their family… and then takes it all away,"Hi, I’m new here.

The reason I found this sub is probably obvious: I’m in pain. Deep, haunting agony about a tragic loss some of you may relate to. I want to share my story – to get it out of my system, to make sense of it, and maybe to find validation that I’m not crazy or overreacting.

I’m a 35-year-old married woman with two kids. Recently diagnosed with AuDHD (mainly to have a word for my quirks, not because it dominates my life). All names are changed for privacy.

Seven years ago, I met a woman – let’s call her Lisa (ten years older than me) – at the school enrollment of our kids. We slowly got closer through shared responsibilities as class representatives. When the pandemic hit, our bond deepened. We became allies – sharing our anger at the broken school system, supporting each other through family struggles, laughing, ranting, comforting.

By 2023, we were inseparable.

We discovered we shared the same hobby, and it became a weekly ritual with our husbands. But beyond that, Lisa kept inviting me into her daily life: for coffee in the mornings after school drop-off, to run errands together, to help each other with boring or difficult tasks, to share worries and secrets.

These were her initiatives. I never pushed myself into her time. She created routines around me – and with that, a rhythm that gave me belonging.

At some point, she gave me the keys to her house. Not as a spare for her daughters, but as a symbol: “You are part of our family.”

And I was. It became normal for her to text me every morning “Coffee?” I’d walk down the street, let myself in, and she’d already be waiting with two cups ready. Her family half-joked, half-serious: “When are you finally moving in?”

I felt wanted. Not just by my own family, but by hers.

Over time, I became a fixed part of their system. Her older daughter resisted therapy with her mom. I offered to take her instead, as the “auntie.” It worked – the girl made huge progress. Her younger daughter (best friend of my son) attached deeply to me, often calling me “Little Mom.” Her husband Tom and I bonded independently over shared work and interests.

It felt like an adoption. I was a stabilizer in their home. Reliable, present, trustworthy. We even made childish future plans about merging households one day.

And all this time, I also kept my own family life intact. No one ever complained I was neglecting them. I just felt expanded, like my world had grown unimaginable. I was the happiest person alive.

Then, suddenly, the temperature dropped.

The morning coffee invitations stopped. The routines we built vanished overnight. She became quiet, distant, reserved.

When I asked, the answer was always “Nothing.” But it wasn’t nothing.

Soon she began saying:
“I need more time with my family.”
“I just reduce time, not love.”
“You are abandoning your family.”
“I don’t want to remembered as the mother who didn’t cared.”
“You still belong, nothing has changed.”
“You used to be easy.”
“I just want an uncomplicated friendship.”
“Get therapy.”

And so much more.

But for me, everything had changed. She was reducing, cutting back, withdrawing – and expecting me to accept it as if the bond we built could just shrink without damage.

And also her words no longer matched her actions.

I think jealousy and regret started to creep in. With her older daughter, I became the one who managed to get her into therapy and to see real progress. That should have been Lisa’s role, and I can imagine how painful it must have felt for her to watch me succeed where she felt she had failed.

Her younger daughter often turned to me as a second mom. I was the one cooking after school (for all our children), helping with homework, keeping track of appointments, or stepping in when structure was needed. I wasn’t replacing Lisa, but I was steady and reliable in ways she sometimes couldn’t be, especially on her bad days when depression and insomnia left her exhausted. She may have felt pushed aside in her own role.

And then there was Tom. Working in the same profession meant we shared a shorthand. We could talk and laugh about things Lisa couldn’t easily join in on. We tried to involve her, but often she seemed left out. I think it made her feel inadequate and insecure.

All of this together may have made her feel overshadowed – not intentionally by me, but simply by how naturally I became part of their system. What had once felt like a relief to her started to feel threatening.

Later she mentioned she had once been diagnosed with BPD, though she rejected it: “That can’t be me, I’m not like that. I just have depression.”

I didn’t know enough then to argue. But when the withdrawal continued and I was left desperate and confused, I started researching. And it all fit. Especially the quiet BPD traits: suppressing her emotions, people-pleasing, perfectionism, then sudden withdrawal, leaving me in pain and confusion.

It hit me: the bond had been real for me, but for her, it was fragile, contingent, and unsustainable.

It’s been six months since the withdrawal began. I feel discarded. I lost not only Lisa, but also the girls who loved me like family, and Tom, who had become a close friend.

Everyone is walking on eggshells around her. Everything centers on her wellbeing, her stability, her needs. My pain has no place in her house anymore.

I tried every possible way to explain, to share, to hold on. I used every word and every tone I had. Nothing worked. Since April I’ve been trying to “fix” things, but instead I’ve lost a frightening amount of weight, developed anxiety, and live in constant sadness. The most painful part: she wouldn’t recognize her share of this tragedy.

I was willing to do everything to help her deal with her mental health issues. I wouldn’t blame her for her illness as long as she had shown me that I matter too. But all she did was gaslight, project, distract, and deny.

“All the same. I just need time and space.”

My autistic brain seems to need some sort of conclusion. And I have to admit, that I became very forensic in investigating what happened. As long as she won’t tell me what’s on her mind, I have to look for an explanation by myself. Even if I already know a lot more about this disorder, I fear there is still more to learn.

I need validation. I need to know if what I experienced is the cycle others here describe – idealization followed by devaluation and discard.

Because what I lived through has left me traumatized. I wasn’t just a friend. I was given a place in her family system. And then that place was taken away, without a conversation, without clarity, without care for the damage left behind.

I would have accepted any boundaries, if only I had been given a chance to understand the change. I wasn’t forcing or demanding. I was always a reliable and loving partner.

It’s driving me crazy that I have to abandon the girls in order to let Lisa go. I’m terrified of losing the daughters I never thought I’d have and of giving up Tom, who is undoubtedly also an unconscious victim of Lisa’s illness. We won’t be able to continue our friendship. Lisa wouldn’t allow it. It would destabilize her, and Tom won’t do anything that might rock the boat.

I’m devastated. And I don’t know how to move forward.",2,1758982542.0,BPDlovedones,6,1.0,False

I just returned from my quick getaway with some freshest fall pieces for you guys and genuinely, I'm thrilled with the quality of these bargains. The fit on each thing turned out super well. I even succeeded in not getting the second coffee stain on the Supreme hoodie—I took the first one out of the house for a grand total of ten minutes before catastrophe hit. That thing has a magnetic pull towards dark liquids, but at least the grey color covers it up well!
Let's get to it:

Carhartt black jacket: This jacket is so tough, the canvas is heavy and looks durable. The black is an intense color that is fantastic. A size S would be ideal for a fitted look with room for a thin layer underneath. 9/10.

Ralph Lauren down vest: The vest is ever so puffed and incredibly warm yet not at all bulky. The fabric is smooth and the hardware is top-notch. I would opt for a size M for a comfortable fit layering well over a bulkier sweatshirt. 9.5/10.

Supreme grey Hoodie: This is what you want—fleece on the inside is super soft and the grey color is timeless. The hood is generously thick and keeps shape perfectly. A size M provides that perfect loose, snuggly drape. 10/10.

broken planet Hoodie: The design on this is quite detailed and neat. The cotton is thick and has a solid feel to it, making the hoodie excellent in terms of structure. A size S would provide a good, slightly boxy and trendy fit. 9/10.

Kapok Flower Hoodie: I really like the appearance of this one; the trim is subtle but crisp, and the material is thick and good quality. A S would be a good fit, providing a crisp, relaxed silhouette. 9.5/10.

Represent Hoodie: The cotton in this feels great and is heavy, just like the high-quality blanks I adore. The fit is on point for a loose streetwear look. A size S provides an ideal loose fit that isn't sloppy. 10/10.

Carhartt long sleeves: This long sleeve is a heavy-duty basic. The material is substantial enough that it drapes well and the stitches appear heavy duty. Size M would provide me with a good, loose, slightly oversized fit. 9/10.

Ami sweater: The knitting is dense and the tiny embroidery is actually very neat, demonstrating excellent craftsmanship. The fabric is soft and warm to touch. A size S would provide a sleek, cozy fit that appears sharp. 9.5/10.

Cro Heart Hoodie: Print is crisp and the cotton is smooth and heavy. It's a very cozy hoodie with a nice-fitting hood. Size M provides that loose and relaxed shape I prefer. 10/10.

Who Decides War Hoodie: The material is comfortable and the graphics are original and really stand out. It feels high quality and prepared for cooler weather. A size S would provide a comfortable, standard fit that still looks laid-back. 9.5/10.

Stüssy Sweater: This sweater has a great chunky texture to the knit and feels incredibly warm. The logo is clearly woven into the material. A size M would give a comfortably relaxed and easy fit. 9.5/10.

Stüssy Yellow long Sleeve Shirt: The yellow is bright and the fabric is heavy but not too much. It has an awesome boxy and relaxed cut. A size M hangs very well, creating a relaxed, laid-back look. 9/10.

Stüssy black long sleeves: The cotton is heavy and soft, and the graphic print is extremely clean. The sleeves are structured feeling. An S size would fit perfectly, with a comfortable standard long sleeve fit. 9.5/10.

Ralph Lauren long Sleeve Shirt: The cotton here is crisp and feels upscale, and the tailoring appears very clean and refined. A size S would provide a neatly tailored, clean, and business-like appearance. 10/10.

BAPE Miami Double Hood Zipper Coat: The coat is an amazing, one-of-a-kind design with the double hood. The material is heavy duty-looking and the zippers are silky smooth. A size M would be perfect for a deliberately slightly oversized, eye-catching look. 9.5/10.

GALLERYDEPT Jeans: The denim is great colorwise, and the distressed finish is done properly. The fabric is heavy and feels substantial. A 30 would drape well on the waist, creating a relaxed, straight-leg fit. 10/10.

Represent Short Sleeves: The cotton for this tee is thick and structured, so it hangs beautifully. The collar is beefy and retains its shape beautifully. A size S provides a relaxed, boxy fit. 9.5/10.

Gucci baseball cap: The fabric is high quality, and the logo stitching is well clean and precise. It fits easily and has a wonderful shape. The cap is an excellent timeless piece. 10/10.

BAPE White short sleeves: The design is vibrant and looks great against the pure white cotton. The shirt is soft and comfortable to wear. A size M would provide a good, comfortable, and slightly loose fit. 9/10.

Cro Heart White short sleeves: The cotton is thick and smooth, and the heart graphic is really clean on the chest. The cut is contemporary and slightly boxy. A size S would be really comfortable structured fit. 9.5/10.

Burberry Beach Shorts: The material of the shorts is light, thus ideal for hot weather, and the design appears very sharp. The waistband is relaxed and stretchy. A M size would be the ideal, relaxed fit that sits beautifully on the leg. 9/10.
