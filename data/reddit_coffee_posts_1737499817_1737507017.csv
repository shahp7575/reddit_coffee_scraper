1i6yfuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsChat/comments/1i6yfuo/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1737506945.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

How do I figure out my macros? I am 6 2 185 lbs and active five days a week. I walk to work where I serve tables so by no means am I sedentary. I really only have fat around my hips and I want it gone so that’s why I’m trying to cut. 

Tell me how I’m supposed to lose fat whilst still gaining muscle. Please keep it simple and do not be rude. 

Just for context, this is my diet. I eat eggs, non fat milk, non fat Greek yogurt, non fat cottage cheese, tuna, chicken, beans, rice, tons of vegetables, and tons of fruit. ALL OF IT is weighed. I am extremely meticulous. The ONLY things I drink are water and coconut water. I don’t snack. I don’t eat junk food. I don’t eat out. I don’t drink soda or coffee or tea or juice. Everything i just listed above is the entire representation of what has been going into my body for the entire last month. Now that I have my diet indoctrinated into my daily normal Life, I need to know my macros. ",1,1737506926.0,Exercise,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics.

I am currently in my early 20s living with my sister while I work a job at a coffee shop and at a retail place. I have an undergrad degree in envsci and I’m trying to look for jobs that will help support me living on my own as I’ve lived with her for a long time now. I really need to keep searching and applying but I have very little motivation to do anything and I really dislike the city I’m living in. Being in nature really helps my mental state but I’m living in a California city with no rain and no nature. All I feel like I’m capable of is eating and sleeping, I eat way too much sugar and I am tired all of the time. My depression isn’t bad where I’m feeling down about myself, I almost feel like a robot toy with low batteries if that makes sense. When I was in school I loved to read and do work and I would have energy during the day but now I literally can’t get myself to do anything but sleep during my free time that I have to be searching for new jobs. I workout twice a week, take walks everyday and eat healthy for the most part ( esp healthy meals but I eat a lot of candy at night).

Hx of hypothyroidism, anxiety, ADHD, and b12 deficiency (taking synthroid 0.5, citalopram 20 mg, Vyvanse 20 mg daily, and one 1 my injection of b12 monthly.

Within the last 5 years I have gotten blood work done various times, but without fail each time my CRP & WBC have been unusually high, but iron/ferritin is low. Overall I have been asymptomatic, with the occasional spell of fatigue here and there. I have a normal diet, don't follow any restrictions, and do have normal bowel movements.

My family doctors have changed over the years, so the first one did send me for liver ultrasound that (I assume) came back unremarkable as I haven't had to discuss with her -- I am seeing another GP since my first one closed her practice, and he's possibly looking to send me for another liver ultrasound depending on how my recent labs come back (I don't have values of labs on hand, sorry! I just remember each time of the CRP/WBC/Iron because a comment was made by the doctor and then various questions of if i had a recent ear infection, change in diet, etc).

I guess I'm just wondering if maybe NAFLD is what we're narrowing down for, or possibly celiac? I don't really think just have major GI issues that can't be explained by my 2-3 cups of coffee a day. Oddly enough, when I was pregnant was the only time my labs all came back within range; and then about 3 months PP was when they went back to being abnormal.

At first we didn't talk to each other but once we started talking we quickly got along (around mid november). At the same time she got sick and stopped coming to uni. We still talked a lot, called a lot and met twice a week. We went to coffee shops, museums, ice skating, Christmas markets, monuments ... All of these meetings were just one to one, there were no one else

During these moments I've catched feelings for her. So I decided to tell her during new year eve. As you can imagine I got rejected, she only sees me as a friend. 

We continued to chat and to meet this year (a bit less tho, I had exams until last week) and we pretended nothing happened. 

Here's the thing, even though I love to see her, it hurts me to be so close to her knowing the feeling is not reciprocal. On the other hand, if I stop to see her I'll also suffer from it, I'll miss her a lot. 

A few days ago we finally talked about new year eve. I asked her if she's okay to be friend with a guy who still likes her. She answered yes. And when I told her I'm lost and I might end the friendship, she answered she would be upset if I end the friendship because I'm her only close friend

I’ve been on the carnivore diet for about 3 months now(was lion for my first two and since then i introduced egg yolks, not a problem) and while I absolutely love eating this way, I’ve been feeling terrible lately. I have no energy and i've gained fat, i am at the point where I’m close to giving up, but I really don’t want to because this way of eating feels so natural to me.  

For context, I’m 20 years old, 5'10"" (177 cm), and fairly active. I go to the gym 3 times a week and get 10–12k steps daily. Before starting carnivore, I weighed about 68-70 kg (154 lbs) with decent muscle(I know it sounds low, but it never bothered me since I carried it well and people were often surprised when I told them my weight, heres a photo of my physique back then https://imgur.com/a/nxoths0). Now I’m down to 64 kg (141 lbs) with less muscle and more fat, which is super frustrating.  

Here’s what I typically eat in a day:  
- 600g (1.3 lbs) of 90/10 ground beef  
- 10 egg yolks  
- 200g of tallow  

I know it’s not a ton of food, but I’m getting around 150g of protein and a lot of fat like 300g, eating at an 80/20 fat-to-protein ratio, so I thought it would be enough to fuel me. Yet, I’m constantly drained and can’t seem to make progress.  

I drink zero coffee, zero cheat meals, zero spices, im really really strict.

I’d really appreciate any advice or insight on what I might be doing wrong or how to tweak things to feel better. I don’t want to give up on this diet because I truly enjoy it, but I’m not sure how much longer I can keep feeling like this.  

Thanks in advance.",2,1737505958.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

1i6y32p,https://www.reddit.com/r/100Fanojo/comments/1i6y32p/it_snowed_outside/,It Snowed Outside.,"“That’s the way!” The girl hums to herself as her machine continues to beep and click. With a few more presses, the machine falls silent. “Star Gazer 1, I entrust onto you the dream of not just myself, but of everyone here.” You see, more than anything, Isayo Nabata wishes for a snow day. With every day remaining Spring, things have quickly gotten dull. Lush green plants, flowers always in bloom, and fruit forever perfectly ripe. While it sounds like paradise, Isayo wishes for nothing more than to feel the cold air biting at her. Something that isn’t the same thing every day. Isayo sighs as she closes her eyes and presses the button on top of Star Gazer 1. “This is for everyone. You carry with you the dreams of those who have no means to grasp them.” After a short rest, the machine shoots up into the sky. Isayo swiftly opens her eyes as she watches her latest invention take off. Her eyes sparkle as her lips form a wide smile. “Bye-bye! Good luck!” She waves her voyager off as she slips back into her house. If everything was properly designed, then by the time she wakes up, everything will be coated in a white film.

Snuggling into her sheets, another reserved smile sneaks onto her face. As she succumbs to her blankets, dreamland calls to her. That night Isayo had a dream where Jingle and Jangle had asked if she had seen their dog. To which Isayo turned into a snowman and started singing about the magic of the North Pole. You know, her dreams never tend to make any sense. Regardless, by the time she wakes up, she can already feel the fruits of her labor. The small draft in her room hints at the greater treasure awaiting her outside. While Isayo’s first instinct was to immediately run outside, even she knows that would be a horrible idea. So she layers up before venturing into the cold. “Hmmm. I don’t want to get caught in the snow if Star Gazer 1 went haywire.” Looking around, she spots her saving grace. Her adjustable height metal shoes. Isayo speeds up her pace now that she’s properly equipped to handle snow. However, before she can inspect the world of white, she’s stopped by her father. 

“Slow down there kiddo.” He instructs with a worried tone. “I get the hustle and bustle, really. But you’ve never seen snow, much less played in it.” He takes another sip of his warm coffee as he shakes his head. “You don’t know how to make a snowball, much less a snowman. And kids these days won’t know the first thing about snowboarding.” Isayo eyes widen as she jumps back in shock. He’s right. In her rush to create a snow day, she never checked to see what makes these days so special in the first place. Luckily, with a smirk, her father stands. “That’s why I’ll teach you everything you need to know!” One last obstacle stands in their way of wintery mischief. Isayo’s mother. “Oh no you don’t,” she protests. “How come your 14-year-old daughter is better dressed for the weather than you are? You better put on a few more layers young man. Not only that, you have a conference to get to later. You better not try and play hookey because it snowed outside.” Isayo’s father sits back in his chair in defeat. He’s been bested by logic and adult responsibilities. “Heheh. Sorry kiddo, but Mama’s right. I need to be getting ready for my conference later today. But when I come back, I’m sure we’ll have lots of fun together.”

With that, Isayo’s father turns his attention back to his computer as he mentally goes over what he’s going to say. Isayo gazes over to her mother as she approaches the front door, inspecting for any disapproving signs. However, her mother merely nods and gives her a thumbs up. Overjoyed, Isayo hurriedly opens the door and rushes outside. That instant, and second, my friends, she finds her lungs reeling back. She takes a moment to breathe in and get used to the winter breeze. Each breath hurts a little less as her body settles into the cold. Closing the door behind her, she ventures forward. Adjusting her shoes to give her a little more height, she turns left and right. Each time she scans the layers of vast white for anyone else. Spotting no one else, she whips out her Friend Finder. Following it, she soon finds Iofiel… Well, getting character. “Snow angels?” Isayo questions while withholding a laugh. “Indeed, young one,” Iofiel replies with a jovial ring. “I find it in the best taste to perform such glorifying signals. Surely my shrine will be honored with them. Care to join me, young one?” Isayo weighs the pros and cons before simply plopping herself down. She does her best to mimic Iofiel’s movements, the snow soon giving way to match. But after only less than a minute, Isayo is already tired. “I-I don’t know how you can keep this up…” She remarks with a breathy sigh. “Well, perhaps the metal on your feet is weighing you down.” Iofiel points to Isayo’s shoes. “Oh, right, those.” Realizing her error, Isayo quickly bounds back onto her feet. “I’m going to catch a breather.” She waves to Iofiel as she walks away. 

Following her Friend Finder, she finds Nui situated on a park bench. She’s even more slug-like than normal with all the layers wrapped around her. “Oh SLOOG of the bench, what is your wisdom?” Isayo kneels in the snow as she awaits whatever prophecy the lazy girl will spout out. “Walking in snow is more effort than it's worth.” Without any further words, Nui falls back asleep. Isayo makes a mental note of her advice as she starts her trek once more. As she reaches the pond, Isayo carefully steps through the opaque ground. At any point, there could be a puddle just waiting to freeze her foot off. Once she’s close enough, she’s able to make out the figures on the ice. Hiko and Gloria are beautifully skating through the ice. Both appeared as if they’d been doing such for their entire lives. Envious, Isayo steps forward. However, the young girl stops as she hears ice breaking underneath her feet. Her custom shoes are amazing for moving across the snow but are nowhere near appropriate for skating on the frozen pond. Accepting her defeat, she watches from afar. Getting her fill, Isayo moves to the part of her wintery adventure. Ahead she spots two makeshift forts. Walking closer, she spots the two combatants. Toki Kubo and Rikka Matagachi. “What’s going on over here, ladies?” She questions as she takes a step forward. “It’s a warzone out here. Children have no place here. At least, they shouldn’t.” Toki snaps back. “What’s a snow episode without a snowball fight? We have to take advantage of our situation.” Rikka retorts as she tosses a snowball at Isayo. “Go, do a crime. If anyone looks at you sideways, just blast them in the face with that!” She gleefully voices as she begins making another. 

Snowball in hand, Isayo begins to search for a worthy adversary to use it on. “Well, I’ll be,” turning sharply, Isayo spots Hinako. The tall Okinawan woman dwarves her in comparison. “I don’t have the slightest clue how it happened, but it seems we’re having a snow day. Not only that, but it seems I’ve even spotted a mischievous Snowfox scurrying around. Now, be a smart girl and drop that snowball, ya hear?” Isayo eyes begin to fall as she throws her snowball without thinking. “AH! Giant!” Hinako only giggles as the snowball hits her midriff. “Now you’ve done it.” Hinako swiftly forms a snowball of her own and gingerly throws it at Isayo. Isayo smiles as she shakes off the snow. Her silky hair springs up slightly as she does so. “You’re certainly as fluffy as one.” The woman remarks as she takes a step forward. “Now what are you doing going off on yer own? Such a silly child. You blend right in with the snow, someone might even try and make a snowman out of ya.” Monitoring the area, Hinako spots more people playing. “Now why don’t you find a group to go play with, hm? That outta be more fun than wandering around and stumbling across different people.”

Isayo nods as she watches each group and decides which one seems to be the best for her. While every group seems like good fun, they’re made less important once Rentarou walks onto the scene. The girl increases the height of her shoes as she makes a B-line for the boy. “Rentarou! Look, it snowed!” Glancing up, Rentarou smiles as he waves to her. “It did! It somehow snowed in the middle of Spring. Isn’t that amazing?” He pens as Isayo shrinks to match his height. “I stayed up last night making something that would finally give us the snow day we’d been hoping for!” She replies with a goofy grin on her face. “Now everyone can enjoy something completely brand new!” Rentarou pats her head with a reserved smile of his own. “Of course, our local genius had something to do with it.” Isayo laughs as she takes in another view of the environment around them. “Too bad it’ll be gone by tomorrow morning.” Isayo sighs as the realization of the timer she’s on sinks in. “Well then, let’s use this time to enjoy each other’s company instead of worrying when it’ll end. That’s something tomorrow us can deal with.” He takes Isayo by the hand as he joins the others in their snowball fight. The rest of their day is filled with frosty merriment. Friends are aplenty as they’re all just as excited to take advantage of the weather. In the end, it seems Star Gazer 1 successfully guided their hopes and dreams to the starry sky above. But as the day drew closer to its end, the star-bound vessel began its final salute. With a kiss sealed in the snow, Star Gazer 1 leaves the atmosphere, no longer bound to the atmosphere holding it back. To this day it’s believed the machine is spreading beautiful snow days across the galaxy, perhaps even the universe. As was the wish of every boy and girl hoping for a snow day manifests into reality. The end.

I’m looking to get a job as a barista, but I feel it’s challenging since I don’t have any experience in this field. I’m very motivated and eager to learn, but I’m not sure how to approach this.

I’m aiming to find part-time work, but I’m not sure how to stand out to potential employers when I don’t yet have barista skills.

Do you have any advice on how to:

1. Get started without prior experience?
2. Write a resume or present myself during interviews?
3. Search for part-time barista jobs effectively?

I’d really appreciate any tips or personal stories about how you started in the coffee industry. Thanks in advance!",1,1737505842.0,barista,1,1.0,False

I found this surprise at Curate’. I can’t tell you what it’s called, it’s impossibly light, and perfectly prepared. Ask for the crème brûlée’d Tiramisu . I’m guessing the mouse is pistachio with coffee? 9/10

1i6y0i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i6y0i4/vityas_effigy_part_3/,Vitya's Effigy [Part 3],"Sandra’s funeral was small.  I hadn’t expected a whole bunch of people to show up, but there were only seven of us, not counting the priest.  Victor, Curly, Alice and I all rode together, while Daisy showed up later.  The other two people were an older couple, wrinkled and round, their faces etched with sorrow.  Curly told me they were Sandra’s parents.  It was a short service, but very sweet.  Mr. and Mrs. Gulley each giving a short eulogy for their daughter, highlighting how kind and creative and loving she had been.  I reminded myself to call my own mother once I got home.  

The four of us went to lunch after the funeral, deciding to leave the gravesite proceedings to Sandra’s family.  Daisy said she wasn’t feeling well and went home early.  Victor didn’t let go of my hand the entire time we ate, constantly rubbing his thumb across my knuckles.  It was just as much a soothing behavior for him as it was comforting to me; he was never truly at rest unless his hands were occupied.  None of us really talked much, and by the time Victor and I got back to his house, he changed his clothes, went into his studio and didn’t come out the rest of the day, at least not until I went to tell him I’d made some food for us.  My mom had instilled cooking skills in me from a young age, so it wasn’t hard for me to whip up a batch of *bibimbap,* a traditional mixed rice dish, from whatever we had in the fridge.  I poked my head into the ground-floor studio, noticing him standing over a workbench with his back to me.

“Vic?”  He didn’t respond, tinkering with something on the workbench.  There was a sort of trance state he got into when he was working that wasn’t easily broken, but I’d accidentally discovered an effective way of snapping him out of it.  “Hey, Vitya,” I called again, softer this time.  

Something to know about Slavic names: most people don’t use a person’s government name unless they’re in a professional relationship or mere acquaintances, and will instead use a nickname.  The first time I called him that, Victor gave me a weird look and said no one had called him that besides his mother, and that was when he was a kid.  I felt a bit embarrassed and asked if I should not call him that, but he said he didn’t mind.  It made him feel safe, helped him ground himself.  This time, he glanced over his shoulder before turning around, hiding whatever he was working on behind his back.  I took a second to admire how he looked in his “working clothes”, a simple black tank top and a battered pair of jeans.

“What’s up?” he asked, trying to look casual.

“I made dinner, you hungry?”

“Huh?  Oh, uh, yeah, I’ll be right up.”  He waved me off and grabbed a rag to wipe his hands.  I didn’t question what he was working on; my birthday was coming up, and he’d been hinting that he might make something for me as a present, and I knew he’d want it to be a surprise.  

We ate dinner in silence, broken only by Victor telling me in a quiet tone that the food was good, and went to bed early, falling asleep with the TV on.  Both of us were exhausted.  Neither of us talked about Sandra.

There was a cloud over all of us at the next gallery night.  Curly didn’t wave at me this time, too focused on his banjo, and I noticed the fingertips of his picking hand were raw, almost to the point of bleeding.  I could tell Alice had been crying hard, and even the normally jovial Daisy was silent and sullen, her bruised arms constantly fidgeting.  Sandra’s animations were still playing in their usual place, and the grisly snapshot of her corpse had been replaced by a small memorial display showing a photo of her smiling.  Seeing it made me want to cry.  Maybe this is sick of me to say, but I almost preferred the crime scene photo.  I'd liked Sandra, even for the short time I'd known her, and the crime scene photo was just surreal enough that for a moment of looking at it, I could pretend she was still with us.

That was the first time the group of us didn't get dinner after the gallery closed.  Curly and Alice left together as soon as they could, while Daisy slipped out at some point before closing time.  I spent the night at Victor's as usual, but at around 3am I woke to find he wasn't next to me.  Inspiration tended to strike him at odd hours, but every time I'd stayed the night, he stayed in bed with me until the respectable time of nine in the morning.  

When I went to his studio to check on him, I didn't find him working.  Instead, I found him sitting on a block of granite he'd just purchased recently, still in his pajamas, his head in his hands.  His shoulders were shaking.  Trying not to make too much noise, I descended the stairs, tucking my housecoat tighter around me, and rested a hand on his back.

“You okay?” I asked.  Stupid question, I know, but I felt like I had to say something.  Victor flinched, looking up at me with bloodshot eyes before wrapping his arms around me and dissolving into sobs.  I'd never heard him cry before…and I never wanted to hear it again.  All I could do was hold him.

“Did I wake you?” he asked when he managed to calm himself a bit.

“No.”  I combed my fingers through his messy hair.  “Do you…do you want to talk about it?”  He took a long time to answer.

“Not really.”  Classic Victor.  He rarely wanted to talk about things that truly bothered or hurt him.  I figured I could ask again tomorrow when he was rested and not so upset.

“Let's go back to bed, all right?  It's late.”  He nodded, slowly and painfully unfolding his lanky body from the granite block.  He didn't always use his cane around the house as there were multiple surfaces he could lean on if his leg started bothering him, but I could tell it was stiff and sore, so I helped him up the stairs and back into bed before curling up next to him.

“You're too good to me, Livy,” he mumbled, grabbing my hand.  

“That's because you deserve good.”  I sat up for a moment and kissed his forehead.  “Get some rest, Vitya.”



The next couple of weeks were about as normal as I could get.  Work was plentiful, my roommate and I went to a movie on Thursday, and on Friday I stayed over with Victor.  Saturday night came, and I really didn't want to go to the gallery, but I also didn't want Victor to be alone.  He'd never really had many people that supported his talent growing up: his mother had died when he was young, and his father, an austere Ukrainian carpenter whom Victor spoke highly of, had been more concerned with maintaining his furniture store than actively fostering his son's love of art.  I wanted to be that person for him.  I didn't tell him that the gallery gave me the creeps, as he probably would have insisted I stop going, and I wasn't going to let him be alone in the same building as that creepy statue.

Seeing him in that room with it…I didn't know what to think.  Maybe I should have asked him about it sooner.  

Daisy didn't show up that night.  Or the next Saturday night.  I didn't know what to do.  None of the others knew where she lived, and I didn't want to make a nuisance of myself by calling the cops on her when she was probably just taking time to grieve.  However, after the third weekend in a row that she didn't come to the gallery, I had to do *something.*  So I decided to call up another old college friend, Andrew Bishop.  I'd hung out with him and his twin brother Austin (Victor's freckle-faced buddy) a lot during my sophomore year, though they'd graduated soon after and I had lost touch.  As far as I knew from social media, Andrew had become a cop within the last few years.  He might be able to help me.  

It took him a while to answer the phone.

“*Hello?”*

“Yeah, hi, is this Andrew?”

*“It is, can I ask who's calling?”*  

“I don't know if you remember me, we went to the same uni a few years ago.  Olivia Song?”  There was a long pause.  

*“Oh, yeah, Livy!  Of course I remember you, how've you been, girl?”*  The small talk persisted for a while before I got down to business.

“I um…I didn't actually call just to reminisce.  There's something I need your help with.  Professionally.” 

*“Sure thing, whatcha need?”*  I knew I could count on Drew.  He'd always had a penchant for helping people.  Over the next hour or so, I gave him a summary of everything that happened.  I left out the part about the statue; Drew wasn't one to pooh-pooh the idea of the paranormal completely, but he was a certified skeptic.  He remained silent while I talked besides the occasional *“uh-huh”*  and “*yeah?”* to indicate he was still listening.  *“Ugh, yeah, the Gulley-Ransom case.  You didn't hear this from me, but I was one of the responding officers on that one.”*

“Really?” I asked.  

“*Sure was.  I'll never forget it…poor lady.  No one deserves to go out like that.”*  

“Agreed.  But now another one of the group hasn't shown up for three weeks straight.  I'm really worried, she seemed super upset the last time I saw her.”  I could hear Andrew scuffling around in a desk or something before he seemed to find what he was looking for.  “I just…I want to check up on her, but I don't know where she lives.  I think maybe somebody should do a welfare check or something?  Is that what it's called?”

“*Yeah, I can see if I can get somebody on that.  What's her name?”*

“Daisy Fay.  It might not be her real name,” I warned.  “You know, weird art people, they like picking some fancy pseudonym for their work.”  Andrew chuckled, and I could hear the scratching of a pen.  

*“No foolin’.  You remember Victor Levchenko?”*  

“I mean…I've been dating him for the last couple months, so…”

*“You're* *dating* *him?”* Andrew asked, an incredulous tone to his voice.  *“Huh.  Always thought the dude had an angle grinder for a heart.  Anyway, listen, I gotta run, it's my fiancee's birthday and I promised to take her out to dinner, but I’ll take a look in the system.  I'll call you back if I find anything about your friend Daisy, okay?”*

“All right.  Thanks, Drew.  Tell Bridget I said hi and happy birthday, will you?”

*“Sure thing.”*

“Who was that?” my roommate asked as she came out of the bathroom, swathed in towels and looking like the star of a shampoo commercial.

“Old college friend.  We still on for the *Gilmore Girls* marathon?”  Kristen laughed, toweling off her hair.

“Honey, I will never pass up an opportunity to see baby-faced Jared Padalecki.  Yes, we are still on.”



It took Andrew two days to get back to me.  He said what he’d found was serious enough that he couldn’t tell me over the phone, so I agreed to meet up with him at a local cafe.  I told Kristen where I was going and headed out, taking a jacket just in case.  

“Hey, it’s good to see you,” he said when I arrived at the cafe, pulling me in for a brief, brotherly side hug before we sat down.  We each ordered a drink before getting to the topic at hand.  “Before I tell you this, you need to promise me you won’t tell anyone else.  It’s against policy to give out details of ongoing investigations, and I don’t wanna lose my job over this.  Frankly, I’m only giving you this information because you’re the one who brought it to our attention and because you’re my friend.  I wouldn’t do this for just anyone.”  I promised I would keep the info to myself.  

“I just want to know if Daisy’s okay,” I said.  Andrew was quiet for a long time before he slowly shook his head.

“I’m so sorry,” he said.  “I hoped I’d have better news for you.”  He proceeded to tell me that he’d tracked down Daisy’s address (on the “bad side” of town) and gotten his sergeant’s permission to carry out a welfare check.  Unfortunately, Daisy hadn’t needed a welfare check for a good while by the time the police came around.  “The coroner hasn’t come out with the official report yet, but his initial estimate for how long she’s been dead is anywhere from a few days to maybe a week.  Again, we won’t know until he does the autopsy.  Probably.  She was um…she was in pretty bad shape, when we found her.”

“How bad?” I asked, my mind coming up with all sorts of horrible mental images.  He grimaced, taking a sip of his coffee.

“You don’t wanna know, Livy.  The general consensus is that she overdosed and went into a manic state before finally collapsing, but no one does all of *that,* even in a manic state.”  I leaned forward in my chair.

“So you think she was murdered–”

“Keep your voice down.”  Andrew shot me a warning look as another patron passed by on their way out the door.  I recalled just how much he was risking to tell me this and went quiet.  “It’s not my job to say or not, but in my opinion, based on what I’ve seen…there’s no way she did that to herself.”  I swallowed hard, suddenly getting a bit emotional.  

“Do you know if she has any family?”  He shook his head.

“Couldn’t find any.  I do know she had a baby when she was sixteen, but she gave the kid up for adoption pretty much as soon as it was born.  She really tried to clean herself up after that, got sober, went to rehab…” He trailed off, shaking his head again.  “I’m gonna level with you, Livy.  There’s something fishy going on here, and whatever it is, I think it has something to do with that art gallery you told me about.”  I stared into my latte for a few moments before getting an idea.

“What if you came to see it?” I asked.  “Not in an official capacity, obviously, but you could come check it out for yourself.  It’s pretty disturbing, but you might be able to catch something I haven’t.”  I figured I could show him where the statue was when we both went to the gallery; I didn’t want to tell him beforehand and risk him not taking me seriously.  He thought it over for a moment.

“Couldn’t hurt.  I can ask Bridget if she wants to come along, but I’m not sure she’d want to.  Honestly, weird art stuff was always more Austin’s thing.”

“Then why not ask him if he’ll come?” I asked.  “He and Victor were close back in the day, right?”

“Good point.”  I learned that Austin had managed to snag a job as a crime scene photographer at the same precinct Andrew worked at; it made sense, somehow.  Those two would likely have been inseparable even if they weren’t twins.

The gallery was busier than usual that night, the disappearance of two of its artists having caused a bit of a stir.  I met the twins across the street from the little stone church, and we headed inside, Austin looking about as nervous as I felt.  He’d always been fairly timid and introspective, only opening up if Andrew happened to be around.  Letting the twins take in the gallery at their own pace, I went to find Victor.  He didn’t like surprises, and I’d forgotten to text him that they were coming along.  I was sure he knew Andrew was a cop, but I didn’t want to point that out and give him the indication that something was wrong.  

Coming back to where the twins were milling around, I found Austin staring at a framed photograph on a pedestal, his face blanched and drawn.  Before I could ask if he was feeling all right, he called out for his brother, stuffing his hands in his pockets.  Andrew poked his head around a corner, a concerned expression on his face.  Clearly he’d heard something in Austin’s tone that he didn’t like.

“Let me guess,” he said, folding his arms.  “I’m going to want to see this?”  

“Yeah,” Austin said, jabbing one long finger at the picture.  “I think you are.”  He sounded equal parts angry and scared, and Andrew speed-walked over to see what had him so upset.  I did as well, peering at the photo and initially failing to understand what I was seeing.  Austin pulled Andrew to the side for a moment and whispered in his ear, frequently glancing back at the pedestal.

“What am I looking at here?” I asked, and both of the twins jumped, as if they’d quite forgotten I was there.  Austin ran a shaking hand through his hair before semi-calmly explaining that the picture in front of me was an autopsy photo, taken not even a few days ago.  

“Daisy Buchanan, thirty-six years old, cause of death…heroin overdose,” he muttered, unable to take his eyes off the photo.  So I’d been right; “Fay” wasn’t her legal surname.  “There was a ton of other shit that happened to her, but the coroner couldn’t figure out whether they happened pre- or post-mortem.”  I looked back at the photo, noticing strange tiny white lumps in the middle of the cut-open chest cavity.

“What are those?”  I couldn’t tell just from looking at them, or even what organ they appeared to be stuffed inside of.  Austin swallowed hard.  

“Over-the-counter ibuprofen.  We still don’t know how they got in there.”

“In where?”

“Don’t make me say it.  I’m never going to be able to unsee it.”  Andrew cleared his throat.

“I’m pretty sure, and don’t quote me on this, I wasn’t present for the autopsy, that that’s the victim’s uterus.”  I felt a wave of nausea squirm through my own abdomen upon hearing that.  “Whoever did this, they’re one sick bastard.  Creative, but sick.”  

“How do you mean?”  Now it was Andrew’s turn to fidget and look uncomfortable.  He stepped a bit closer to me and lowered his voice.

“When we found Miss Buchanan in her home, she was um…listen, Livy, I’m not sure how PG I can be with this.”  I shook my head.

“Just tell me.  I’ve probably seen worse.”  He took a deep breath.

“We found her basically…*crucified.*  She was laid out on the floor with syringes through her wrists and ankles.”

“Jesus,” I muttered.  

“Pretty much,” Andrew answered.  I turned my attention back to Austin.  

“How do you know so much about the autopsy?”  Austin looked over at Andrew, tilting his head.  Andrew nodded.  Austin’s shoulders slumped.

“Because I took the fucking photo.”  

“*What?”*  

“Which means,” Andrew chimed in, folding his arms, “that somehow, someone broke into the police station and got the photo off the SD card.”

“Why the police station?” I asked.  

“I don’t take my work camera home with me,” Austin explained.  “Preservation of evidence is really important, so I put it in a locker at the end of the day.  Electronic locks, even, it should be impossible to break into.”  

“And there’s no way you could have left the locker open?”  I wanted to believe that my friends were better at their jobs than that, but journalists have to ask all the questions.  

“It locks automatically, so no,” Austin said, shuffling his feet a bit.  “It only opens if I scan my ID.  Or if the power goes out, but nobody is supposed to know that.”

“My brother is very particular about the handling of his camera,” Andrew said, patting Austin’s shoulder.  “Won’t even let anyone else touch it.”  Austin nudged his twin in the ribs with one bony elbow, grumbling something about people messing with the settings.  

The discovery of an official autopsy photo was what finally got the gallery shut down for a few weeks while the police investigated.  Of course, Victor and I had a visit from a couple of polite but very serious detectives who asked us a ton of questions about the gallery.



For a while, I thought that would be the end of it.  Now that he wasn’t constantly working on some new thing for the gallery every single week, I could finally manage to get Victor to take a break.  We went out for dinner more often, visited museums, went to a couple movies, and for at least a short period of time, we both went to bed at the same time each night.

But then one day, we were sitting on the couch, sharing a bowl of popcorn as we watched *Mrs. Doubtfire.*  It was one of my favorites, and he’d never seen it before.  Right before the scene where Robin Williams in drag absolutely beans Pierce Brosnan with a lime, Victor’s phone rang.  He picked it up with a deadpan expression, and I paused the movie.

“Hello?”  There was frantic speech I couldn’t make out on the other end.  “Curly, your Texas is showing, I understood exactly zero percent of what you just said.  Calm down.  No, don’t talk *louder,* talk *slower.*  Okay, I’m putting you on speakerphone, I’m with Livy right now.  Go take a drink of water, it will slow down your breathing.”  He put the phone on speaker, setting it on his knee.  “It’s Curly,” he said to me.  “He sounds upset.”

“Darn it, I *am* upset!” Curly’s disgruntled voice came through the phone.  I heard a gulp; he must have taken Victor’s advice about the water.  “Listen, V, it’s Alice.  She ain’t answered her phone for three days now, and she never does that.  Like, you know the settings on the phone where you can see if somebody read the text?  She hasn’t read her texts!  That ain’t normal, not for Alice.”  I raised an eyebrow at Victor.  

“Have you considered going to her apartment?” he asked, sounding less annoyed and more concerned by the second.  

“I’m there now, I’m outside the building.  I just talked to her landlady, and she says Alice ain’t left the apartment for quite a while.  No visitors either, just some old lady she thought was her grandma or somethin’.  I’ve got half a mind to call the cops, man, somethin’s wrong.  I can feel it.”  There was a long silence.

“All right, don’t panic.  We’ll come over, maybe she’s in a composing mood,” Victor said.  Curly gave him the address of Alice’s apartment building, and they said a brief goodbye before hanging up.  I set aside the popcorn as Victor went to grab his keys.  

“I’m coming with you,” I said.  If something was going on with Alice, I wanted to help.  I clearly didn’t know her as well as Curly did, but I still cared about her.  Victor nodded, and I slipped into my shoes before following him to the garage.  

“I suggest you call Sherri and Terri on the way.  It might be nice to have some law enforcement presence without swarming the place with police,” Victor said on the way.  I racked my brain for a moment before I realized he meant the twins.

“You know they have actual names, right?”  He shrugged.

“It’s funnier this way.  Besides, they’re the only pair of twins I’ve met who don’t have a weird sexual thing going on.”  I rolled my eyes and pulled out my phone.

The twins had already arrived by the time we got to Alice’s apartment building, and we found them talking to Curly, trying to calm him down.  I could hear faint cello music filtering down from an open window, which I assumed belonged to Alice.  It sounded…wrong, somehow.  Harsh and grating, not at all like her usual playing.  

“--dunno what the rules are for this kinda thing,” Curly said as we approached, “but is there any way y’all can just, y’know, go in there?  Do a welfare check or whatever it’s called.  I knocked on the door a little bit ago, but I don’t think she can hear me.”  

“Well, we talked to the landlady ourselves,” Andrew said, “and she told us that the cello music has been playing for at least forty-eight hours.  Non-stop.  That alone is enough cause for us to go in and check.”  He looked up at the building, tilting his head.  Austin mirrored the gesture almost subconsciously, something that had always freaked me out a bit.  

The music only got louder as we got near the apartment door.  Andrew knocked firmly on the door.

“Alice Beckett?  This is the police, can you come to the door?”  No break in the music, no indication that she had heard us outside.  Andrew tried a few more times, with no answer each time.  “Okay.  I think we’re going to have to break down the door.”

“Shouldn’t you call for backup?” I asked, but he shook his head.

“If she’s been playing continuously for an entire two days and then some, she hasn’t stopped to eat, drink, sleep, nothing.  She’s not gonna be in great shape, we need to get in there and figure out if we need to call an ambulance or not.”  He waved us off.  “Might want to stand back.”  The hallway wasn’t very wide to allow for a running start, but the door wasn’t very sturdy in the first place, and with a swift kick from both of the twins, we were in.

Immediately, we were hit with an intense, coppery smell, tinged with something acidic.  Curly barged in ahead of us, calling for Alice, and disappeared into a separate room for only a few moments before suddenly letting out a startled yell.  The twins rushed after him, and Victor and I followed at a slower pace to the living room at the back of the apartment.

“Holy shit,” said Andrew.

“Oh my God,” said Austin.

Victor said something in Ukrainian that was probably not repeatable in polite company.

I couldn’t say anything.  

Now we knew where the smell had been coming from.  

A cello lay broken on the red-stained floor, stripped of its strings and bridges.

And yet, Alice kept playing.

1i6xw1m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6xw1m,The entertainment during the slow march to facism. A collection of thoughts.,"""Men willingly believe what they wish.""
– Julius Caesar

I'm not an intellectual, I'm not a smart man, but I do know what luuurve is. So I have hurriedly done my best in the time I have to elucidate some observations below. 

Even before the inauguration, there was one saving grace... 

Watching the conservative meltdowns with all the post-election bait and switches. The leopards eating faces is in full swing. It's all over social media and it's pretty to watch.

Farmers, hospitality and builders are shitting themselves, both employer and employees, about the no holds barred ""undocumented immigrant"" deportation plans. Ex-allies cracking the shits. Lowsco MAGATs regretting being dumb. Tech Bros wondering WTF happened. Just all round regret out there for the world to see. 

So I'll start with who I feel are the biggest of losers whom have realised they have backed their antichrist - the ""illegals"". The ones who no matter how hard they try will never be ""oNe oF uS"".

Believe it or not, undocumented immigrants, the ""illegals"" made up as of 2022, a massive estimated 8.3 million people in the civilian workforce (static notably since 2007), that constitutes about 5% of those working or seeking work in America. They are massively overrepresented in certain jobs... You know, the ones that no ""white"" people want to do... The low paid or back breaking laborious jobs. That's 26% of farming, fisheries, and forestry workers; 17% of cleaning, maintenance, and groundskeeping workers; 14% of construction workers; and 11% of food preparation workers. (Wikipedia)

These people have been ""factored in"" to the economy for decades they keep prices low and businesses operating. Now they are suddenly about to be ripped out of the economy where they contribute approximately $11.7 billion annually in state and local taxes (Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy), add around $13 billion annually to Social Security, but only withdraw about $1 billion in benefits. (Social Security Administration 2016)

About 50% of undocumented immigrants file federal income tax returns, according to a report by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI, 2023). Despite this, they are ineligible for most federal and state benefits funded by their taxes, such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. (Congressional Budget Office, 2020)

The Latino vote - especially males was pivotal in key swing states. For instance, in Florida, Trump won 56% of the Latino vote, contributing significantly to his victory in the state. (Phoenix Florida)

With talk prior to the election, that mass deportations would be an executive order, yesterday it came true, with him signing the order for the ""largest deportation program in American history."" This plan includes deploying military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Fox 5 News)

Not only will they try to deport the undocumented, but he has signed another order with intent to end ""birthright citizenship"". That is, the deportation of children and grandchildren of undocumented immigrants born in the USA. (Politico)

Deportation to places they have never been and maybe don't even speak the language. 

The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution included the provision for birthright citizenship. The order will be challenged and I assume will end up in SCOTUS. 

Those hungry leopards will be fended off by the American Civil Liberties Union law suits.(WSJ).I picture the ACLU will have many fights over the next 4 years. Often fighting a fight for those that actively or passively acted against their own self-interest. Rowwwwrrr.

So what about all of those soon to be missing illegal workers? The deported children of those illegal immigrants? The once 5% of the workforce, now leaving so much work to whom?

Hence, as I said, farmers are shitting themselves. But I have a theory. 

Did you notice the surge in prison stock prices on Trump's victory? Private prison stocks the ""for profit incarceration"" industry, experienced notable gains. GEO Group's shares rose by 74%, and CoreCivic's shares increased by 55% after the election. (Financial Times). GEO donated nearly a million USD to Trump. (News Week).

I'm betting that of those 8.3 million workers to be ""deported"" most won't be. Either it's another broken promise to the Base or they will be put into prison farms and turned into slave labour. 

This is where the 13th Amendment of the Constitution does support Trump and the potential for this to happen. 

""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" (Constitution of the United States of America). 

You see, after the abolition of slavery, Southern states faced economic challenges due to the loss of free labor. The exception clause ""except for punishment of crime"" allowed these states to maintain a labor force through the criminal justice system, leading to practices like convict leasing, where incarcerated individuals were leased to private enterprises for labor. (History Channel). Southern states then enacted laws known as Black Codes to criminalize minor offenses, disproportionately targeting African Americans. But this time it's the Latinos.

The legacy of the exception clause is still evident in today's criminal justice system, where prison labor remains prevalent. (Cornell Law Review). Trump will build on this. 

Social media has been full of conservative regret about this. People voting against themselves because they went in blind or just thought ""not me, they are talking about the criminals"". In other cases I've seen spouses voting against their partners position or children voting against their parents position. If the ACLU isn't successful, that will rope the leopard lovers into it. It's sad that the non conservative informed will be dragged into this also. 

However, the unholy alliance of the president and the first lady Elona has probably been the most interesting, with Elona going against the MAGAT ideals and promoting the increase in H1-B visas. The visa that allows entry to ""higher educated"" workers. You know, the ones that bring in sub continental Indians who will work for a pittance, accept lower work standards, be shit scared to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and being deported back home. 

That comes off the back of Tesla sacking 6600 tech workers and bringing in 1300 H1-B workers (Snopes). But it doesn't stop there. 

It's a thing of beauty and I compiled this before the inauguration, so this shit is going to ramp up like a petrol fire. It leads to the next face eating fest that is so beautiful to see... 

That's the Ultra MAGAs like Bannon, Fuentes and Loomer who are now mad enough to lynch a history book. They see the unholy alliance as a betrayal by Trump for accepting any immigration (and themselves not personally benefiting from it). 

Loomer the conspiracy theorist and out of the closet, proud to be racist, Fuentes the ""your body my choice"" mysoginist and Bannon the once been to gaol for Trump, fell out, now back to bros, advocate for America over every other country policy. He decided to do the time by contempting congress in refusing to be deposed by the select committee in the Jan 6 insurrection investigation. The committee that Trump, Loudermilk and some house members have called to have prosecuted due to investigating the King in trying to overturn the election. 

So Bannon is like the consumate Libertarian that takes no notice that the position they are in now, has been through centuries of social cooperation, domestically or internationally, But hey now I'm on top now, so let's rip out the carpet and every one for themselves. You know, that ""America First"" policy Trump holds dear.

So these guys didn't seem to notice that Trump flip flops to any position that benefits him and now that the First Couple are in bed for plenty of dollarydoos, the minions are angrier than a redneck at a tofu festival. So pretty.

His supporters.... Damn. They are on the same page and spitting chips for the same reason. They would rather have José the spud digger and his family sent packing, than take a middle of January swim in the newly named Gulf of America. SMH on that one being chalked up as a win for the new administration, some of the irate MAGATs are saying.

I guess the next biggest feast the leopards I'm seeing online is in reference to the tarrifs. I'm not seeing as many regular punters picking up on this on twitter or conservative Reddit as they are, in the majority a bit to dense to understand them independently.

They only really pick up the gist when they are interviewed online, where they start off raving about how awesome it is that China is going to pay 25 to 50% more for what America buys from them. Yeh... I'll say that again. China will pay more for what America buys from China. TBH I think that is what Trump thought when he started talking about Tarrifs back in 2016 too. But once he's there, he's there and just like a rabbid kangaroo, there's no going backwards. Remember Sharpygate?

Back in 2016 he tried the tarrif thing and implemented them in 2018, firstly on Aluminium imports, washing machines and solar panels (USTR press release). Maybe he had an inkling that Russia could do with a few more on the international market, so they could actually have some outside St Petersburg and Moscow. The Russian attempted to made up the difference during the Ukraine invasion, but just got distracted by actual toilets. Maybe porcelain shitters should have been on that tarrif list also?

So in 2019, next was the Chayyyna tarrifs, 25% on $50 billion worth of goods. (USTR section 301 Fact Sheet) that launched a retaliatory response. A trade war. The interesting thing was however that Chayyyna was strategic in their implementation of retaliation.

Retaliatory tariffs targeted various American products, notably agricultural goods such as soybeans, pork, and corn. Boom they hit the red regions of the US, those that supported Trump (US-China Business Council).  Studies indicated that these tariffs led to increased prices for U.S. consumers and disruptions in supply chains. (Princeton Economics Department) Enter leopards that love an ignorant voter.

So, it is widely known among economists that protectionist tarrifs are counter productive. It's why they have lost favour since the 1930s when the Smoot-Hawley tarrif act blew up in the faces of the depression ridden country leading to a global trade war and exacerbation of the great depression. (National Bureau of Economic Research). Countries imposing retaliatory tariffs decreased their imports from the United States by approximately 28% to 32%, highlighting the detrimental impact on U.S. export markets (Oxford Academic).

Trumps tarrifs will now be aimed squarely at China, Mexico and Canada and have been cited as 25% on his neighbours and 60% on China. (Business Insider). The aim, to increase revenue and increase domestic production. 

So now we are looking at increasing government revenues, paid for by the American consumer. 

In 2017, having lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21%  PERMANENTLY via the Tax Cut Jobs Act. Individuals in the median bracket of $42k went from 25 to 22% and those on over $418k went from 39.6 to 37% but that has an expiry of this year (Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis).
His TCJA was projected to add approximately $1.9 trillion to the national debt over a decade (Congressional Budget Office).

He now proposes lowering the corporate rate again now to just 15% for American Corporations. (Thompson Reuters Tax and Accounting). 

Nice one American consumer, you are now going to pay at the shop for the tarrifs whilst the tax break given to the corporation you can be assured, will not be trickling down. Voodoo economics is a Reagan myth.

There may be an increase in domestic production in some sectors? Industries such as steel and aluminum may experience short-term gains due to reduced competition from imports. However, past experiences indicate that initial benefits can be offset by broader economic challenges, including retaliatory measures. (Reuters)

And so who's likely to have their faces adjusted by a big cat? 

The automotive sector. Tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico could disrupt the supply chain as the automotive industry is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on cross-border trade. 
Michigan - Ford and General Motors, Battleground State. Thank you Trump. 
South Carolina- BMW, Red State. Tennessee- Nissan. Red State. 
Kentucky- Ford, Red State.
Georgia - Kia, Red state.
Indiana - Subaru Red State.
Mississippi -Nissan, Red State.
Alabama- Mercedes US, Red State. 
Texas- Toyota and Tesla, Red State. 
California- Tesla, Blue State and that aint changing. 

Already, U.S. automotive manufacturers have expressed significant concerns regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adverse effects such measures could have on their operations and the broader industry.

General Motors analysts indicate that GM, could face substantial profit declines if a 25% tariff is imposed. The increased costs associated with these tariffs are likely to be passed on to consumers. (US News Money)

All them redneck semi-iliterate cowboy pickup lovers and factory workers will find out that Ram Trucks is projected to experience a significant reduction in annual core profits if the tariffs are implemented. The company may need to reassess its production strategies to mitigate the financial strain caused by increased import costs. (The Hill)

The additional costs incurred from tariffs are anticipated to be transferred to consumers, resulting in higher vehicle prices. This could lead to a decrease in demand, further impacting the financial performance of U.S. automakers. 

Yeeeehaww Grandmaw! Them majority red state employees might be getting their Xmas bonus delayed for a bit because you and I know, shareholder profits take precedence over the common folk.

What else will suffer?  Well them techbro Melon fanbois are not gunna be happy. Products such as electronics, apparel, and beauty items are expected to see price increases as companies pass on the additional costs of tariffs to consumers.  (Vogue Business)

The complex tech supply chains that rely on intricate global supply are unlikely to be duplicated in the United States, high labour costs compared to Mexico and China just ain't gonna let it happen. Look forward to paying two grand for your PS6 or $3K for your new NVIDIA RTX 5090 . Lol. Already inventories are being stockpiled but that ain't gonna last long. It's expected that sales will decline up to 68% (Signal AI)

Agriculture: Previous tariffs have resulted in retaliatory measures affecting U.S. agricultural exports. Farmers may face reduced market access with retaliation tarrifs and lower commodity prices, exacerbating financial strains within the agricultural community. (Reuters) Throw that into the fact your workforce has been incarcerated or are in hiding and that face is going to need more than hog shit to cover the mauling.

So who else has been regretting not voting, or voting for Trump? Well probably a pretty big percentage of low-income earners which, when you check out the stats overall, is in the majority, people in red States. Mississippi, a red state, poverty stands at 19.58%, making it the highest in the United States, while Louisiana, another red state, follows closely at 18.65%. In contrast, blue states like Massachusetts and New Jersey have significantly lower poverty rates of 8.5% and 8.2% (Visual Capitalist). 

And what goes along nicely with poverty? Medical issues. It's beautifully being played out in social media with so many rednecks saying that they're so glad Trump is going to get rid of Obamacare, but at least they'll still have the Affordable Care Act. As I write Trump has just recinded Biden's Executive Order lowering prescription drug prices under the ACA (Whitehouse.gov). What a choice now.... a carton of eggs or a half tablet of grannies heart medication? How fucking dumb do you have to be to vote yourself into medical bankruptcy or die because your too stupid to get past your exclusive Fox News consumption? You think Fucker Carlson ever gave a fuck about you? Maybe dig a little bit deeper to understand the nuances of things that you affect you and your kids before voting for your favourite orange thing.

Speaking of kids... You're going to be forced to have more, or just die whilst trying. Those state Republican legislatures are going to go full force in putting the lives of those unviable foetus' wellbeing above your daughter's, wife's or Mother's. Thanks Mitch and Trump for effectively stacking SCOTUS with Christian conservatives who overturned Roe. 

Already, sadly Trump voters have died. Josseli Barnica of Texas, suffering a miscarriage and dying of sepsis due to having Trump enabled abortion laws, or Nicole Thurman dying after being denied timely abortion care. (ProPublica)

That shits gonna be on steroids now. Trump enabled southern states, are looking at wider travel bans for pregnant women, with Texas already having put restrictions on travel to obtain abortions out of state (AP News). I hope that red voting Daddy is gunna be happy the meth head, that got his little girl up the stick, is gunna be hanging with him and Jr at Christmas soon. 

JD Vance, that guy who's going to be looking up at his two cybertruck chested daddies for the next 4 years, (the irony of this non nuclear family in the Whitehouse) has refrained from confirming or denying support for the right of pregnant women to leave the state for a termination of pregnancy (The independent). 

The University of Colorado Boulder projected that abortion bans could lead to a 24% increase in maternal mortality overall, with a 39% increase among non-Hispanic Black women. Also, a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that in 2020, maternal death rates were 62% higher in states with abortion restrictions compared to those with greater access (28.8 vs. 17.8 per 100,000 births). This disparity is expected to widen post-Roe, as more states enact restrictive laws. (Home)

Time to lock up those red state daughters! Oh.... That would suite many anyway, because that's what it is about. Controlling women, not protecting a foetus. 

That's quite obvious when you look at the stats for dumped newborns post those Trump enabled SCOTUS changes. In Texas, since RvW was overturned, there was a 12.9% rise in infant mortality against the 1.8% rise over the rest of the country (JAMA Network) and at least 18 babies were deserted in 2024 alone in Texas (Yahoo News).

That's the Southern GOP/MAGA for you. Anyone that breaths air, not amniotic fluid, that doesn't earn at least the median wage, need to get a hold of them boot straps and start saving for that rainy day. You're on your own. Yep even if you voted for them.
So many other beautiful leopard stories. What about those that voted for peace because Trump is all about peace?

You didn't like the fact Biden didn't come down hard on Netanyahu? Thought Good ol TBone will step up? Lolz... That shit got settled before Biden left office (it will never be fully settled btw) and your complacency in voting has lead us to this. Peace? Despite being a violation of the Logan Act the orange sloth will try to take credit.

Step in ""America First"" AKA ""fuck the rest of the world"". Not even a ""If your not with us you're against us"". That's right. Melon and Trump have both been seeing a bit on the side. Putler who happens to be at odds with the rest of the civilised world.

That's a whole nother story and not a leopards tale. Mainly because anyone that respected Global Rule of Law would have the sense not to vote red. They probably read something other than their twitter feed whilst on the shitter. Remember that thing that Reagan stood for? Standing up to tyranny. No more of that shit now its follow the cash. Trumps been Putlers lapdog since the 80s (themoscowproject.org).

So Biden's sanctions on Russia have bought them to their knees. Not down and out. Putler has been waiting for his money launderer to take over and save him. Smoke and mirrors time.

Trump has already suggested using military or economic power to force Denmark to hand over the island (Reuters) with the Kremlin's Dmitry Peskov already likening it to Russia taking Crimea (justification for Russia).  Then there's Panama. He doesn't like the price of passage and the Chinese operating a port nearby, so that in his eyes, gives him authority to invade the country. (AP News) 

Feeling peaceful yet?

What about Canada? Thought it was a joke? Watch this space. It won't happen but the rhetoric gives a glimpse of the level of power he's looking for. He's praised Putin, Xi Jing Ping, Kim Jong il and Orban, despite concerns for their democratic principals or human rights records (International Business Times). 

Again as I write Mexical drug cartels are now terrorists according to him. Troops on Mexican soil next? Well they are heading to the border right?

If you were looking for peace, between starting trade wars, alienating Allies, supporting dictators, threatening military and economic annexation, yes your apathy or action has really made the world safer. Was Palestine your motivation for not voting blue? Watch this space and keep an eye out for those big cat spots.

And then there's the uneducated battler that just doesn't have the media savvy or is just to apethetic to look for more info. Cost of living? Price of eggs? Nice slight of hand you missed there. 

The promise to make things cheeper? Told you Biden is to blame for inflation? He would bring prices down? Then told Time magazine ""it's hard to bring things down once they are up"". Just remember that, in 4 years after the trade wars are in full swing.

Other Conservative outcry has been the prospective cabinet picks. 

Gaetz. The statutory rapist as investigated by his own party being found to have paid an underage girl $400 for sex and attending drug fuelled parties, paid $90k in payments for sex and drugs, obstructed congress investigations and tried to influence witnesses and also accepted impermissible gifts (AP News). Yep the GOP stood up to their own on that, (for other reasons not the debauchery), but nope the Orangeutang wanted him as the countries top prosecutor, that is, until he fell on his own sword. 

No worries. Let's replace him with someone who he can trust. Pam Bondi his impeachment lawyer who when questioned about birthright citizenship (of which Trump signed an EO on in the following week), she said she would have to go and research it (International Business Times). Ie I don't want to go against the boss so I'll play dumb or I just am unqualified?

Or what about those conservatives that are smacking their heads about the Antivaxer who is the head of Health, RFK?  Time for a reemergence of Polio? Or his desire to ban high fructose corn syrup? Those arse fucked farmers are going to be left wondering about that one too. 

Conservative veterans on the appointment of Pete Hegseth as Def Sec. Allegations of sexual assault (potentially a qualifying point) and alcohol abuse. But more importantly he was a fucking Major in the National Guard! (Wikipedia) What a qualification. Certainly a high flyer and exposed to international level politics there. Not.

Then there's another mate of Putin's. Tulsie Gubbard. Also of Bashar al-Assad. No intelligence community history but hey she's loyal, so let's put her as the Director of National Intelligence. Adept at parroting Russian disinformation (PBS), so maybe that was an endearing qualification? Her, despite a group of nearly 100 former national security officials urging the senate to ""carefully scrutinise"" her nomination. (The Hill) Ie... Don't do it.

Then there's DR OZ. The Medicare nom. Known for having promoted pseudoscience throughout his career. In 2015, a group of physicians called for his removal from the faculty at Columbia University, citing ""egregious lack of integrity"" in promoting ""quack treatments.""  (Looper) Maybe all those red voters can augment their removal of Medicare and Medicaid benifits with his green bean coffee extract, whilst the leopards feast.

All up the net worth of his cabinet is estimated to be nearly $500 billion. Double the GDP of countries of Greece or Hungary. ""Oh BoTh siDEs aRe the SaMe"" other conservatives reply. No... Biden's cabinet was $118 billion. (US News). The world sees an oligarchy forming. GROK agrees.(GROK)

Then there's another Putin contact. The ketamine addled Musk who we covered earlier. Conflict of interest central, who is already meddling in European politics, with France, Germany, Scotland, Norway and Spainish politicians criticising him (Reuters) for his Lex Luthor attitude and obvious world domination ambitions. 

Speaking of conflict of interest. Even tik tok has sparked the ire of the leopard mauled conservatives. After Trump pushed for its divestment by executive order in August 2020, on national security grounds, the ban being passed by the house to be enforced by 19 Jan 2025. Trump has extended the deadline by 75 days whilst Chinese officials consider the sale to Muskovite himself. Boom. Another Tennent of moving towards a facist dictatorship. Control of the media. But from what I see online the conservatives are mainly saying ban it already.

And still on Herr Musk... Another beautiful thing, is the wakeup call for the Conservatives is the concept of him being the ""free speech abolitionist"". The moment he took over Twitter the left were being blocked, shadow banned and demonetized. The right for years continued to talk of free speech. Nazism and bigotry became Twitter's future because of tgat free speech (of the right). He blocked the ability to block content from your own feed that you didn't like. The EU investigated his manipulation of far right party posts during elections (Reuters). But for the Conservatives... It only becomes an issue when they are banned. And banned they have been now. The H-1B visas have pissed so many off, that they are coming out in droves. Take a sip from that cup of shut the fuck up he's told them. They don't like it. 

The potentially most significant tech hiccup came when tech streamer Asmongold called him out for cheating on Path of Exile 2.

Muskovite did a live stream of him playing PoE2 and despite having a high level and good kit was walking past valuable items seemingly oblivious of their value. Asmongold called him out for potentially account sharing or outsourcing advancement. Musk didn't like this and released private DM with Asmongold in order to deligitimise him. This riled up the techheads. Notably not all potential leopard victims.  Asmongold was  highlighting this off the back of Melon bragging previously, as being one of the top Diablo gamers of which others thought suss also. (The verge) The tech bros are now pushing back and could that be a big part of his future downfall? 

Another thing the tech bros are livid online about is Trump and crypto. Fucking Musk and his manipulation with DOGE coin already, but it seems as usual, Trump in his Dunning Kruger perpetual state, has learnt about crypto... Great for money laundering it seems. So in a massive conflict of interest he launched the Trump Coin followed by the Melania Meme Coin. 

Crypto coins are really cheap to startup. Can be as low as $500 to get it underway. Then the speculative market takes over. This can be exploited with what they call a ""pump and dump"". Basically the initiators buy the initial coin en mass when worth nothing then others jump on-board to buy their own and the price goes up. The initial investors make massive profits at the expense of others by dumping the bulk and dropping the price.

Trump dropped his coin on the market the day before inauguration. Confliiiiiict? 80% of the initial investors were Trump affiliated orgs. (Wired). Within hours of release the price surged to $75.35 from 18c. A $13 billion market capitalisation. (News). Former Trump Aide Scaramucci described it as ""corruption"".(Newsweek). Within a couple of days it's now trading at 95c.(Coin Geko). It looks like the master of grift has done it again. I'd put my left nut on the line, to say not one of those first 80% hold any coin at all, in any quantity. 

This is where the tech bros offered a lovely face delicacy to the cat. The didn't vote it on them selves, they backed the super grifter with their own hard earned cash... And lost. So pretty to see.

So what else have the leopards been feeding on? Well the 200,000 supporters that forked out to travel to DC then to find it was to be moved in doors are more than a little miffed. After spending months complaining about the price of eggs, then forking out thousands of greenbacks to get there...  Cited as a weather move indoors, MAGA pundits were left watching the oligarchs closest and newest supporters soaking up the indoor heat. Weather? Maybe it was just that small crowd size fear again? It was cold... But not an unprecedented temp. Wind chill of 5°F (-15°c). Regan's outdoor event was wind chill of -10°F (-23°c). I think Trump was as afraid of the smallness just like Stormy was of his. 

Then there's the event organisers who still haven't been paid. They aren't posting but the memes and news reports out there are exposing the full grift that is DJT.(See attached).

All in all, new reasons to have ones face ripped off by a leopard are popping up every couple of hours it seems. We will really see the extent in the coming years. 

Some of us will be immune. Many won't. For those that did the right thing its a sad situation. For those that were apathetic or actively supporting the future racist you can get fucked. You suffered from arrogance or ignorance and neither are an excuse for what is now going to transpire.

I have not even touched a criticism of this oligarchy, if I were to do that, I would never finish it. The Moscow connection, the lies, the manipulations, the backstabbing and the childish thin skinned selfish self serving, narcissistic escapades would run on too long. 

I have picked a few reactions to the bait and switch, the media manipulation and the grift.

Twelve miles long, with nothing on either side of the road for several miles more. A long strip of patchy asphalt. Connecting some old housing lots to the town of Kalitfish. I’m a new member to the small group of houses at the end of the old highway. I moved in just a few months ago. My neighbors have been semi welcoming. Your general fair of nice families saying hi every once in a while and the quintessential grumpy old couple. I only ever interact with any of them at my café job in town. 



I work at Kal’s Café. A straight nine to five, with an hourly of eight fifty. Not at all a bad gig. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Obrinn, are very charming people, if a little blunt at times. My co-workers consist of Susan Blutwick, waitress, cook Bob Colatcky. Susan is a brilliant twenty seven-year-old woman with customer skills like no other I’ve seen. She always carries her note pad with her. Either to take orders or to write her next story ideas down. “Before the day's last asshat takes it with them.” as she would put it. Always gets a laugh out of me. Bob is a grizzled but jolly middle-aged cook. I don’t actually know his age because he never says the same number twice. One day, he’s fifty-five and the next he shaved off ten years. He always tends to have a content demeanor, but I get a sense that he’s lost a few things along the road of life. 

I, Dan Kinns, take care of the cash handling and help both Bob and Susan. A bit of a middle man. Standing at six foot three over my average to short coworkers, I tend to have something I can help with. I’ve grown up with Susan, seeing as we both have lived in Kalitfish our whole lives, with me being just a year older than her. We have all been working together for about four years now. We’ll have Christmas dinners together and the occasional escape to Whitelakes bar. I’d do anything for those two. 



My change in address didn’t mess with my schedule at work, but it did mess with it at home. I get up around Seven, which gives me enough time to actually wake up and then drive the commute to town. My cat Pips thrives in our new abode. She loves being away from all the noise in town. However, she never minds when Susan and Bob come over to shoot the shit. Neither me nor Susan have any close by family anymore, and as I’ve mentioned, Bob seems to have lost whatever he had. Either by divorce or something else, I’m unsure. I don’t press him for info because I wouldn’t want to be pried at either. 



“You writing your manifesto or something? I thought sitting and ignoring everyone was my thing, Dan.” Susan says as she walks by and bumps my stocking cap up. 

“I know I’m stealing your whole personality.” 

We both laugh a little as I put my notepad away. There are a few patrons eating in our fine establishment this morning. Getting in before we close early. It’s New Year’s Eve and the Obrinns want to let us have a break. The week leading to Christmas was a doozy when it came to business. It felt like half the town showed up. 

Susan makes her way to the last few groups, dodging the counter as she heads around. I tend to ram right into it, while she always swiftly swings her hip out of the way. 



“How’s the food today, gentlemen?” She announces. Two men sitting in the corner booth look up in partial surprise from her sudden appearance next to them. With a half stuffed gob, the stubbly one says, “Itsh good thanksh you!” The other man nods in agreement, wiping some mustard off his mustache. 

“Oh that’s wonderful! Are we all done here with the plates?” 

Both men nod rapidly and start collecting their mess, slightly embarrassed. Susan tends to have that effect on customers. Turning them all back into toddlers being told to finish up. 

“Perfect. I'll grab the check.” She then swiftly makes her way around to the kitchen door. I hear the clunk of everything hitting the sink as I print the ticket and grab a pen. I set the supplies on the counters edge right as Susan reappears. 

“Thanks!” Grabbing the paper and throwing me a wink. I wink back and go to the register. “Still so coy, ain-tcha.” Bob chimes in through the little window behind me. “You know it, bub.” I snap back. 

“Bub? I thought I was Bob? There’s an O not a U, Annie.” He chuckles and slides back to cleaning the fryer top. I can’t help but smile as I close the register with the men’s newly delivered payment. 

“The days almost over.” Susan says with a drawn out sigh. She stretches and twists her back, audibly cracking it. Her face gives a little twinge of “ouch”. 

“Almost. Seems like Bob has everything on his end tidied up, and I just have to move the cash from the register to the back.” I pull out the register's tray and set it aside. “Yeah, I got it lookin pretty damn good back here!” Bob yells from the back, quickly followed by a crash and splash. “Dammit! Well, not so much anymore!” 

Susan and I giggle as an annoyed mumbling rumbles from the window. 

“Like I said, almost.”

The sky darkens as the day passes. The ground is blanketed by the wet slush of early mounds of snow. The start of a long, tough winter. “It’s gonna be a deep snow this time round.” Bob lets us know. He puts on his big green windbreaker and brown steel toe boots as Susan and I follow suit. I’m wearing my black, puffy bomber and Susan dons her favorite parka. “Already getting pretty damn cold.” Susan shivers. 

“I'll get the car warmed up, don’t worry.” I point my thumb at my clunky dodge caravan. The car, that’s managed to survive my driving for almost eight years, has gotten quite the workout. I’ve had to get new power steering and redo my brakes a fair share of times, but it’s been my savior just as much. 

“Sounds like a good idear there.” Bob says, pushing his way out the door and heading for his truck. 

“He’s eager.” I say. Susan nods, “yeah, he’s really looking forward to meeting your bourbon stash.”

“Ha! I should have withheld that info better until we got to my place.” I zip my jacket and grab my keys from the hook. “I’m excited to see little pips again. The cutie.” Susan smiles softly, remembering my fuzz ball that awaits our arrival. 

“She’s been yelling at me all morning before I left. It’s like she knows when you guys are going to come over.”

“She's just tired of you and needs another woman around.” She bumps my arm and heads out the door. I raise my eyebrows, “Oh, she lets me know.” As I walk out the door, I see one of my neighbors cars head past towards Main Street. Then another I recognize goes by. “Huh, I guess they have some New Years plans too.”



“That’s the family across from you, isn’t it? You know, I caught her daughter sneaking peaks at you, playboy.” Susan gives me a devious smile. 

“She’s still in high school, so absolutely not.” I retort. Susan laughs as she walks. “Isn’t that what weirdo guys always want is some young high schooler?” 

“Gross Susan. Absolutely bleh.” I stick my tongue out. “I’m offended you would think of me in such a light.” I fling some snow from the hood of my car at her. She squeaks and runs to the car door of safety. Just before I get in myself, I hear Bobs truck turn over and stop. Another “chunk chunk chunk” flows into the air, followed by silence. 

“Well shit!” Bob says, stepping out of his old beater. “Uh oh” I say, stopping my descent into the driver seat. “Need a jump? I’ve got the cables.”

“Nah, don’t worry about it. You’ve got room in the back seat of your hunk-a-junk?” 

“For you? Always.” I say, waving him over. Bob leans back into his vehicle to grab his stubby coffee thermos and heads over. As I slide into my seat, Susan asks, “What’s wrong with it now?” 

“I don’t know. My guess is the battery.” Just then, Bob plops into the back right seat and fills us in. “It’s the battery. She warned me before heading to work, but I didn’t listen.” He lets out a sigh and settles into the seatbelt. I throw Susan a smile, proud that I guessed correctly. 

“Well, we’re happy to have you aboard the youngens crew.” Susan says. “Hey now, I’m only about ten years older than you wipper snappers.” 

“I thought you said you were turning fifty just yesterday?” Susan spins around to sass the inconsistent man. “Must of misheard me.” Bob gives her a cheesy grin. 

My car starts just after a few turns. I hear Bob grunt. It purrs with a loud rumble as I reverse and head on out. Turning right, I pull out onto the road. Another car I recognize as one of my neighbors, drives by. A hand waves as we pass each other. Waving back, I say, “Well, it seems we’ll be the only lights on in my neighborhood.”

The road is lit by headlights. The sky is pocked by clouds. The snow on the sides of the highway desperately reflects any remaining light, creating a reverse silhouette of the ground and sky.  The drive is beautiful, though. I’m glad I moved out there. The fields flanking the road are vast prairies. There’s not any houses built out in either direction, just the small cul-de-sac where my home resides. The highway used to continue all the way to the next town down the valley, but after more people moved into the area, they made a new highway and cut off this one. I’ve been told it’s because of city and county costs for upkeep. They would rather not keep repairing miles of road that little to no one actually used. Plus, they could just put an extra house right where the road continued. My house. 

“Oh cool! You have a road house!” Susan, ecstatic with her genius joke, yells at me. The sudden amazing joke makes me swerve a little. Bob explodes with laughter, leaning his head back with a loud cackle. 

“I knew” I say exasperated. “I just knew that joke would happen.” 

“Of course you knew.” Susan interpreted, “that’s why you bought the place.” She leans back into her seat, knowing she had won. “I’m sorry Dan-O” Bob leans forward wiping off sweat from his hilarity fit. “I’m torturing you with road shit from now on!” I reach back and slap at him. “Whoa! Hey! I’m sorry! She’s made me!” 

Getting two hands back on the wheel, I see a car parked along the side of the road, facing towards us. It’s off and seems to be empty. A limp face against the snowy background. “Hmph, I don’t recognize that car.” I mutter as I slow down to get a look. The car is completely frosted over. Through the icy fuzz, I can see it’s a 1983 Toyota Tercel. “Well… it’s not one of my neighbors.” The car slowly passes, letting me see the back window. An oddly colored smudge stuck out in the corner of the window. “Huh?”

“Why huh?”  Susan, looking over me to see the car, says half paying attention. 

“I… just hope whoever can come get their car.”

“Probably took a wrong turn, some tourist.” Bob says with a tinge of mockery. Passing the car completely, I look forward again. I can see the few trees on the right that signal your entrance to the cul-de-sac. The first two unlit houses pass. Then the next on the left. Then home.

“End of the road, boys and girls!” Bob says getting out of the car with a slight bit of extra effort. Susan and I follow. Stepping up, I see something in my window. Another odd smudge. It’s larger and whitish grey. It moves towards the door as I open. A slight shock of intense regret fills me. “What if it’s something bad?” A loud and sudden “mreeeoow” blurts out of the lightless home. “\*Gasp\* Hi pips!”

Susan trots over to the screaming pips, a light grey tabby. She picks the fuzzy alarm up and kisses the cat's face. “Oh I missed you little lady!” 

“Like I said, she’s missed you too.” I move past the two lovebirds. Bob stops to pet pips' currently un-smothered side. “Hey pips.”



The house is warm and bright, now that we settled in to celebrate. Busting out the bourbon and pretending to surprise Bob with it was a highlight. We played some games while watching Bill Maher warn us about the ball about to drop in Times Square. First, a few games of “Sorry!” Then, once we got bored with that, we played monopoly. As you can imagine, we decided to head to the living room to just sit and talk pretty soon after. It was me and Susan on opposite sides of the couch, and Bob in my hammy down lounge chair. The ball had dropped, and we were all feeling a general fuzz inside. 

“Damn good stuff you got here, Dan¬O. I’m proud my taste has rubbed off on you.” Bob raises his glass to gesture towards me, then back to himself. “Yes, of course.” I say, trying to decipher if that gesture was meant to be a toast. Susan, taking it as a sign for a toast, lifts her glass and announces “To the new year.” 

“To the three of us.” I with my glass, stand as I follow. 

“To taking a piss because I have to go.” Bob says, quickly re-raising his glass and reaching for my hand to help him up. Susan smiles and rolls her eyes at Bobs great ending to the toast. I chuckle and grab his hand. Pips rolls over in her bed, having no want to stay up this long for us humans new year. 

“God, I miss that cat.” Susan looks at Pips with genuine love in her eyes. 

“Yeah. I think we both just really missed you.” I let the thought spill out a little faster than I can fully comprehend the words. Susan throws a quick side eye at me. Not offense, but surprise. 

“I’ve missed you both too. Things have been… crazy lately.” She softly says the last part. Seeming to do the same as I had. The words roll in my mind for a second. “I hope things are alright…” I say.

“Yeah. Just getting past… you know who.” The memory of her coming to me in tears smashes up into my mind. She was bruised badly. A swell of sorrow and empathy wash over me. “Things are getting better, I hope.” Trying to comfort the thoughts bubbling in the room. 

“They are. Times just come and go, you know. I’ll be fine, then not so much anymore. Comes in waves.” She slowly slumps into the couch. Rubbing her finger on the side of her glass with far away eyes.

“I’m sorry, Susan. I understand. Things get real tough at times. I know the feeling. The lights do turn back on, though.” I say, sitting down closer to her. We sit staring out the front window. The dark horizon is flecked with small, barely visible stars. 

“It must have cleared up.” I say. It was a beautiful night out. 

“I really did miss you.” Susan says in a low voice. The sentence brings me back to sobriety. I’ve always liked Susan. As a friend, but I had daydreams about more. She had just always been with “you know who” up until two months ago. But I was going to be her friend and support first. I wasn’t going to look for an in when she was that far down. So I subdued my feelings and was there for her how she needed. 

“You’ve been such a…” she chokes some tears down. “Such a lifesaver for me, Dan. I don’t honestly think I would have made it past Christmas without you. Or Bob, of course, but you get me.” She giggles and I smile. 

“I’ll always be here, Susan. And I’m damn glad to have you around.” I slide my hand towards hers, which is now resting at her side on the cushion. She pulls a little from me, but then relaxes. Right then, Bob opens the bathroom door and shuts it loudly. 

“Woof a bit more than just a pee break.” 

Susan and I retract our hands quickly. Snapping back into a hopefully inconspicuous position. Bob, seeming not to notice, wades his way to the window. “Damn, it got real dark. Nice and crystal clear, though.” 

“True. Seems like your snow prediction won’t turn out.” I say, placing my last piece of ice from my glass into my mouth. 

“Oh it will. Which means we should probably deliver your two guests…” he bows a little as he presents himself and Susan. “Back to their homes. Unless I’m the only one going home tonight.” He spikes us with that comment as he turns to get in his jacket. Both me and Susan stifle a smile and blush red-hot, feeling caught.

Outside is extremely cold. The air immediately bites away at our skin. My breath turns to great plumes of mist. The three of us become a moving group of hand rubbing and brrrs.

Moving around to the car I see all my neighbors' homes are still without any lights. Their cars aren’t in their respective driveways, either. 

“I guess they are out for a long one.” I say unlocking my door and then releasing the other doors. 

“Shouldn’t their kids have school tomorrow? Not like I’m some parent but…” Susan shivers more as she leans into the car. Bob takes his place and off handily says. “Nah. The kids always get New Year’s Day off.” We all slam our doors close as Susan and I look at each other, then back at Bob. Susan laughs a little and says. “Why do you know that?”

Bob looks at both of us with a defensive eye. “Hey now I’m not on some list you freaks! I just used to work at the school. Janitor, if you couldn’t guess.” 

I laugh, turning back to start the mechanical icicle, while Susan just nods with understanding. “Yeah, makes sense.”



I let us stew in the frigid air to let my car get warm. Once I feel it’s reached an adequate temperature and the other two have annoyed me enough with their cries of “hurry up, my bits are freezing off!” I back out of the driveway. My headlights flash us with the image of the other houses. Lifeless and cold. My mind jumps to an abandoned town, with me alone and freezing. Susan interrupts this thought with her own odd visions. “Wooden corpses.” 

“Cut the creepy shit. Jeez.” I look in the rearview mirror at Bob. His face looks worried. Like legitimately worried for a split moment, then he settles back to his normal look. It seems we all had some intrusive thoughts. Each house passes by. One on the right. The next two flank both sides. Then nothing but frozen open road. 



The car now warm and moving, glides along the road. I turn up the air vents and try to lighten the mood with the radio. Flicking it on and turning the tuner proves a fruitless task. Nothing but hums and static come through. I keep an eye on the road but keep fiddling with the stereo. Not a single station. 

“Well, never mind on music.” I say giving up and just focusing on driving. The three of us are quite tired by this point. It’s 2:00 am and way past all our bed times. So the car stays generally silent. I occupy my mind with thoughts of the road. The time it takes to get to town is about twenty minutes. The speed limit is forty, and I’m not pushing it, so it’ll be about thirty minutes. The road has plenty of patch marks and crumbling sides. The snow has stayed off the warm asphalt, which is lucky for us. 

Susan lulls her head in a failed attempt at keeping sleep away. She's got her head down vigorously writing on her notepad. Presumably jotting down some idea for a future novel. She’s so beautiful. Long-ish black hair that starts to twirl right at the ends. Her eyes, a deep brown. Warm lips that smile even brighter. 

“Hey there, Dan-O, you're swerving a little.” Bob, rightly, brings me out of my fog eyed daydream. I slightly jump and adjust the car’s trajectory. Susan peaks at me with a small smirk. 

“Isn’t this where that car was sitting?” She points to the side of the road where the Toyota was sitting. “I guess whoever did come back to get it.” She says, closing her notebook, further giving in to sleep. 

“Glad they got out.” Bob says drearily. 

“I thought they were some dumb tourist?” I call back to him. Seeing that he’s grown a heart. 

“Sometimes I get grumpy about such things.”

Bob falls further into his own dreamworld. I smile and return my attention to the road.

Where the moon would cast enough light on the snow to semi illuminate everything, tonight is moonless. And extremely dark. Anything outside my high beams is an abyss. Which is why I didn’t see what I just hit. 

A sudden, blurry flash of color speeds into the light and subsequently my car. I slam the brakes, but the momentum carries us straight into whatever just jumped onto the road. We clipped the end of whatever it was, throwing it off the side of the road. The car lurches to the side, facing slightly to where the object was just thrown. Miraculously, the headlight isn’t out, but I can see bits of the plastic cover all over. 

“Jesus Christ!” Bob yells from the back. “What you hit? A truck?” 

“I don’t know, but god-damn that hurt.” Susan rubs her neck. Her head having slammed forward from the impact. 

“You ok Susan?” I say, catching myself reaching over to her. 

“I’m good. What the hell was that?” 

“I don’t know, but it was a fast sucker. Most dense deer I’ve ever hit.” I look back out towards the side. The snow glistened in the light. Just to the right, there was a lump of… something. Steam rose from the pinkish mass. I can barely see any details apart from it looks to be filleted. No blood from my vantage point, but sliced. Put into layers. The skin looks scabbed and blotchy. As I sit horrified, unable to move or tell my companions, the shape lifts. Ungulates. The sight spins my brain and I finally speak. “My god. What the fuck is it?”

“What do you mean?” Bob leans forward, trying to see the horror that has stunned me. 

“We need to leave, Dan! Please.” Susan states her terror so clearly, I don’t even question the choice. I stab the car back into gear and kick the pedal. Right as I do, the shape shudders and shifts violently upwards.

It stands on two feet. At the edge of the light, I only see half the sickening figure. The putrid thing stands on two feet! I start to freeze again. My bulged eyes glued to the horrid thing. Susan grabs my arm and yells, “Go damn it!” I go. My car screams forwards. We dip off the side of the road, but quickly swerve back onto flat raceway. I ram the pedal down to full speed. I start to breathe frantically, Susan starts humming with utter fear, Bob shifts away from staring back, screaming “Dan move! It’s coming! It’s fucking running!” The car yells in powerful rumbles as it gets pushed beyond any normal speed. Fear and disbelief pull my vision into pinpricks. We make incredible distance, but it doesn’t matter. The sliced meat slams against Bobs door. Without time for any of us to think, the door is all but ripped off. The monster reaches in and tears at Bob as he screams, half from relentless pain and half from sheer terror. The hellish thing grabs hold of Bob and jumps. Pushing so hard against the car it sways. Bob is ripped from the vehicle. The seat belt snaps like a rubber band. Suddenly, Susan and I are left in silence. The empty abyss fills with terrified and ceaseless screams. 

“Stop the car Dan!” At the command, I slam the brakes. The horrible screeching of the tires still isn’t enough to drown out Bobs sharp roars. Suddenly, my mind clears with memory. “I have a gun in the glove box! Grab it!” Susan takes no time to rip open the jockey box and hand me the revolver. In one swift motion, I spin and stand outside the driver's side door. I catch the faintest glimpse of bodies in the obsidian blackness, painted red from my taillights. I fire at the damned creature. No purchase. Bobs cries continue to fill the air. The sounds of the struggle move further away. Susan and I stand stunned and terrified. Faint screams echo through the night.  

“Where’d it go?” Susan trembles. 

“I can’t see anything.” I say. My left-hand shakes with the revolver pointed at any sound. 

“Let’s turn the car around and use the headlights. We have to hurry” Susan steps back into the car. “Come on Dan!” She yells, pulling me away from my stupor. I lower the revolver and get in the still running car. Breathing heavily, I twist the wheel and start the turn. Without dipping off the road, we turn and face the way from where we last heard Bob. The lights caress the landscape. The empty fields look to go on forever. An eternal abyss with no hope. 

Coming to a full 180, we see where the thing dragged Bob. “There’s our trail.” I say, staring at the blood staining the porcelain snow. Fearing Bob has already died, I hesitate. The carnage this thing left behind was terrible. If it can almost rip a car door off, what can it do to Bob. 

Susan looks at me and, with a shaking hand, places hers on mine. “I know. I know he’s probably gone, but until we check, I'll never forgive us. If you can’t tell, I'm mortified too. But we have to go. Bob is strong.” I let out a sharp and trembling sigh. We have to go. 

“Ok.” I shift and drive. 



The car dips and sways as we leave the road and start our new path. Living out here has instilled the need for winter tires into me. So the car has little to no trouble moving over the terrain. The sickly pale is broken occasionally by tuffs of dirt and dead grass. Consistent streaks of blood lead us forward. I roll my window down so I can hear anything that might give away Bobs position. The cold envelopes the cab. Susan has done the same and is staring out her side to find our friend. Occasionally, we hear a grunt or new hellish scream. The trail leads on. We are about thirty yards out when we hear something. Talking. 

It sounds like Bob and… something else. A constant muttering and Bob loudly saying “Shut up! Please god shut up!”

“He’s alive!” Susan exclaims with muted relief. I rev forward at a faster pace, making sure to not go too fast as to not accidentally run him over. The trails of blood and matted snow lead down a dip. My headlights shine straight over the decline, making it seem like a pool of tangible darkness. As we creep closer, the severity of the decline becomes obvious. It’s a sharp drop. How far down, neither of us can tell. “Damn it. I can’t risk this thing going down there.” I say pulling the hand break. “We could flip ourselves right on him.” I start to open my door. 

“Dan listen.” Susan holds her hand out towards me. I freeze and strain my ears. The sound of crunching snow becomes apparent. They're heading up from the ridge edge. I sit back down and lean out the window, aiming my revolver towards the snowy lip. “Thank god, I’m left-handed.” As I make my remark, a balding head appears. I tense my hand ready to blow the thing away when a hand lifts into the light. Bloody and missing a pinky and ring finger, Bobs terror struck visage runs up the hill. Susan exhales in true relief, making me realize I had been holding my breath too. I yell. “Hurry Bob!”

Susan gets out and flings open the rear right door. It squawks loudly from the force of its earlier encounter. She then runs over to Bob and helps him limp to safety. When they reach about a foot away from the hood, the fleshy monster reemerges. It’s fully illuminated in the high beams. The thing stands just shorter than Susan. It’s pink and red skin glistens with sweat. I had missed the fact that it had a mouth the first time. Barely visible teeth peak out from under one of the flab’s. Its eyes are sunken black thimbles behind more sagging chunks of skin and fat. Its heavy breathes steam as it huffs. The body is noticeably feminine, but if there are any actual genitalia, it's well covered by more off-color flaps. 

“Run!” I scream and take my place leaning out the window again. Before I get my sights on the blob, it lunges out towards Susan and Bob. I fire a shot, hoping to at least change its trajectory, but the bullet goes wide. They all fly forwards and splay out across the ground. I fling my door open and start to run. Before I even get around the car, it's on Bob again. Grabbing at his face and forcing his flailing arms down. It starts to scream in his face, “You're just a fucking pig! Worthless meat! Why’d you leave! She was right there, you bastard!” The words are filled with vile hatred. Pure spiteful sludge. Bob cries out, “Shut UP! Help!” 

Susan, regaining her feet, stomps down on the thing's head. Her boot squelches as it connects. The thing reels back and grunts, pulling away from Bob. Without hesitation, I aim and fire. The crack rings my ears. The shot strikes true, blasting through the chubby flaps around the creature's neck. It falls fully away from Bob and flails. The most horrendous, skull splitting scream, cries out to the cosmos. Susan covers her ears and stumbles backwards. The sound rattles my chest. Bob takes no time to kick away from the beast. The thing crawls frantically away back down the slope. From the wound, a slick, brownish liquid spills to the ground. It smells of an unkempt gym locker and tangy bile. In the darkness, I can hear its breaths weaken.

“Dan, help me get him in the car!” Susan pulls Bob up and slings his arm around her. I peel my sight away from the inky pool and go to help. All three of us shuffle to the back passenger door and slide Bob in. Quickly, Susan runs around to the other back seat and sits next to him. I follow and retake my driver's seat. I push the hand break down and crank the wheel left. I slam the pedal and spin the car back towards our tracks. Quickly following them back to the highway. 

“Jesus, Bob, you're bleeding all over.” She looks around for something cloth to make sudo bandages, “Dan, I need something to help stop the bleeding.” 

“All the way in the back, there are some blankets and a backpack with shirts in it.” My sad little winter survival bag was never really meant to help with full-blown medical emergencies, but here we are. I keep my eyes scanning for anything other than snow. Either the road or that fleshy mass. Susan reaches over the back seat and grabs the backpack. Bob helps by holding it open as she pulls out three shirts. “Keep yourself steady, girl, I’ve got a lot of time before I bleed out.” Bobs exasperated words get a mean side eye from Susan as she starts ripping the shirts to make multiple bandages. “How the hell did you get that thing off the first time?” I ask. “I have a way with words.” He says, coughing before continuing, “plus a good right hook always helps.” We all can’t help but smile. 



The road appears ahead, and I take no time to get back on track. “Small bump here.” I warn my friends. Susan stops wrapping Bobs hand for a moment to let the bump swing us all from left to right as we re-enter the road. Getting to flat ground, I hammer the pedal forward. I'm not sticking around to find out if my shot was enough to kill it.  

“I hope that’s better, Bob.” Susan leans back and sighs. She shivers a small bit and looks out the window. “It’s better.” Bob takes a deep breath, clearly holding back painful moans. “Thanks Suz.” 

“So what’s the damage on you. Full report.” I say. I want to know how much time I have and how much Bob can do. If we find something else. 

“Well Sarg, I have a piece bitten out of my shoulder, insane scrapes all over from my free sled ride, oh, and I’m missing two fingers.” Winded from his report, Bob slowly slumps down in the seat. 

“You're one tough son of a bitch.” I say, amazed at how he’s even still awake. 

“Don’t talk about my mother that way.” Bob retorts. “What did you talk with that monster about?” Susan poses the question, silencing the cab. Bob rolls his head back. Takes a deep breath, and tells us. 

“It was my wife.” I clench my hands on the steering wheel. Susan slowly turns towards Bob. “What?”

“Well, it was her voice at least. And… her words. You two don’t know this, but I was married twenty years ago. Margaret. We had a kid together and everything was fine. Was. My…” His voice creaks slightly. “My daughter Clare… went missing. Right in our backyard while I was just inside.” I can sense the tears welling in Bobs eyes. “There was the forest right behind our lot. We don’t know who or what did it, but. She's gone.” The car feels colder than ever before. Bob shifts to look out the window. Out into the empty shadows. “After it all happened, our marriage got horrible. We’d fight. Almost any second we weren’t drunk, we’d fight. I started to hate her guts as much as I’m sure she hated mine.” A long, silent pause sits upon us. “It all ended after I….hit her. She never stopped yelling at me. I asked her to stop. Begged! But I couldn’t take it.” 

“No need to go further, Bob, we understand.” I try to save us all from living through that abuse again. Susan sniffles and shifts a bit further onto her side. The vast, freezing road lies ahead. I blink away tears.

1i6xafs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Easy-Chemistry5464/comments/1i6xafs/im_forgetting_everything/,I'm Forgetting Everything,"My brain won't let me remember most of my childhood unless there's pictures involved. I don't recognize the kid in the photos but I'm always told it's me. I don't feel like that's me. I was supposed to have twin brother. before being born the doctors told my mom she was having twins a few weeks prior to my actual birth she was already having contractions. This is all a part of her account or her retelling of what happened and even then she wasn't fully there for it. It goes something like this, either she was loosing one of the baby's or both if not attended with emergency, shes told me I wasn't her first conceived but not born to or developed fully she's very particular on the way she tells me these things almost like hiding something else. I know my father wasn't taking care of her and had her locked in a apartment for the beginning of that baby's life cycle, I know he could be mean or angry but I never knew he was that monster until I saw first hand the garbage he truly was. As you can tell I can't even keep track of what I'm ranting on about. So she had lost that baby, later on it was me and my brother, when at the hospital she couldn't bare the pain so in her words time was so skewed and she lost days due to it we were to be born sometimes late February but due to the complications she had to have a C-section to pull both of us out. I in my heart think they couldn't afford to have two boys let alone one. My parents at this point are living with my PEDOFILE grandfather dudes dead btw. 😮‍💨 Shit I'm skipping stuff.  I'm guessing the procedure went according to the doctors one of us was to be named after our father and the other his own name. I don't know why I'm telling this story or why I feel what I feel since I didn't have to live it. She basically lost 4 days in the midst of it all she came back probably a week after I was born. She said she wasn't allowed to hold me until the day she got to leave the hospital. She told me the doctors asked her if she wanted to put me up for adoption or take another baby home with her since the other boys parents had just given up the baby. I don't know how any of that works . I honestly wonder about that other boy some days hope he has a good home with a loving family. but reality is the world isn't puppies and rainbows. So my theory is they had both of us. My mom says he sacrificed himself so I could be a full grown baby. She thought she was going to loose both of us because she was bleeding when they took her to the hospital. Growing up my grandfather had a soft serve ice cream truck company. Come to think of it now it adds up being the fucking creep he was. He didn't treat his children right and raped his second born daughter and last born. My mom said when she found out what he did to her sister they were here in Americam. my mom was 15-19 I'm not sure because she's had to grow up so fast as well and I'm not keen on prying her past anymore these were conversations I had with her my freshman year of highschool I was still 13 turning 14 and even at this moment I can feel the pit in my stomach and the urge to hurle my insides out. So she goes grabs a tire iron they had for the trucks which were more than 12 trucks Dude for the life of me mentioning my grandfather makes more memories come into mind but for this I need to hurry up and get to the point. She destroys a couple of the windshields and starts to go to town on them. I'm not born yet. So this happens flash forward. I love playing in the garage because you can hide in between the trucks and there were so many tools around you could use anything as damn toy keep in mind a kid 8 or less could get fucking mangled of not supervised. This one day a boy comes in from the garage next door. This is important because the two garagess held the whole of his company.  Today in 2025 my mom's half brother sold everything. We lived on top of the garage next door in in something of a apartment. I had never a single day in my life seen this kid before, I'm always in and out of the of my apartment it's my parents. My dad at this point is working for my grandfather so every day early morning he would just leave to go ready his ice cream truck he had to take apart the trucks ice cream machine apart every night and come morning reassemble and load all the mix or cans he would need for the day. My aunt lives downstairs so it was home to me. She had her own room she's never been married or had children but when the time came she became my godmother at my baptism. THE DAMN KID. so it's any summer day hot as balls I'm outside after most of the trucks left I was so into talking with strangers PLEASE DONT LET YOUR KIDS OUT OF YOUR SIGHT MAN. back then kids would be out and about doing what ever kids do nowadays you see them with phones or non existent. This bald buzz cut skinny scrawny boney looking kid slow comes down the staircase we use to come down leading right into the garage on the right the garage on  the left was used for my grandmothers two brothers and mom's two half brothers ,and her two full blooded brothers trucks and the other held the other half of the crew but they seemed very particular on the parking and who used what truck and if you saw another dude using your truck it was hands on sight something about sabotaging the trucks. I don't recognize him but I figured he was a cousin I never met. Something about being ethnically ambiguous always bothered me. I always thought I was related to everyone and always felt like all Native Americans were relatives to my dad ??? Wtf right. My mom used to tell me to stay with my aunt if she was out with my dad selling ice cream but as all true adventurers the call of the wild is more than anything. I've spent most of my life missing my parents even though I had them. I grew up spoiled because they literally were not there spoiled in the sense I had all the new toys and crap then again I was some sort of miracle to them. I would always give my things away because that I learned from my godfather he said a person always had a price or something like if you want friends be giving. They are to this date crazy catholics and sadistic Christians.  THE DAMN SKELETON KID.  Is say this because he was hungry he literally asked me if I wanted to play but you could hear the growling from his belly. Im surprised I remember this but it's also a mix of word of mouth from my Godmother, she says I came to her asking her for some food but it was strange because I only told her it was for the boy in the garage. She said there couldn't be a boy there because it was closed and there was no way for anyone to come in. She was in charge of opening and closing the gates at the beginning of the day and at night when everyone was to come back in, they didn't have schedules so they basically worked on commission and tips. My uncles had there tricks to make the ice cream mix last longer if they ran out during the day instead of coming back. They would basically buy from there own father to sell and then only get part of if it back because the trucks belonged to him this was the first time I met Greed. You'll know Greed Better Than yourself if you don't catch it quick. To this date I have no clue why they had such a dumb loyalty to their father but religion is a bitch no man can  contradict without being cut off and believe me I've had my arguments over where I stand only because my family is intimidated. So this boy is hungry somewhere in the dark garage next door empty and cold because it's was all cement. It could be hot outside but if the garage was closed it would begin to get cold in the darkness. I was allowed to free roam since I was ""smart for my age"". I was coming down from being upstairs on the roof while its still blazing hot outside I can only remember this one day the tar on the roof started to melt and it would stick on your shoes and this duct leading into the garage and leading further down somewhere? Come to think of it I never saw where that went and I really don't want to know since the lot isn't in our family anymore. I threw a Superman into the duct and never saw the damn thing again or heard it hit bottom. The Strange shit about the duct is the buildings didn't have any central heating or cooling no thermostat in sight so but that together for me, fuck. Upstairs we had those old metal gas heaters where it would burn the absolute shit out of you if you leaned on it or touched it. So I'm coming downstairs and I feel someone behind me I look back up and I see him I almost yelled, this is my recollection.  My aunt says I came to her asking her for food back then it was 4 bags of chips for a dollar. So we had plenty of those since one of my uncles was selling them on the low as to make more money than my other uncles. She gave me the food and asked where the boy came from and to her surprise I said upstairs or outside and she asked if I need help closing the door leading out. She basically did the reasonable grown up dessicion to get up and go check this kid out. She says he had blue eyes but she didn't want to bother him, she said that it wasn't until later that she realized there was no way that he came in because for starters there was no way for me to move the metal bar that closed the iron door between both buildings so surely I wasn't outside or on the roof. She said I was in the back of the garage talk to something on the shadows. Then she yell out tell him to come over here so he can eat with us, I said something like he says he's not hungry but he wants me to go with him. She said no you can't, you have to come eat because your mom said so.  She said I was starting to look scared so she just kept the conversation going like ask him what his favorite color is or what he wants to play small simple questions. At this point my godmother is anxious to see this kid. Now this I vaguely remember in my mind she walks towards me in between the trucks that didn't go out that day, most days my family just wouldn't show up because they lost hours and didn't make enough and other times they were just so drunk they wouldn't get up I come from a family of drunks. She say the boy had one blue eye and one brown. I remember both of his eyes being blue like ice a white almost crystal color. I only saw something similar like this working at a McDonald's where a man came in for a black coffee but he seemed so out of place and when he gave me the money if felt my soul get shoved into me. Like I was lucid dreaming until that point , the only way to describe the sensation is like jolting while sleeping. She asked the boy where came from and all he said they were waiting for him and that he needed to leave we opened the door together and let him out. Now to a later sighting my aunt said I came back one day crying my eyes out saying I didn't want to play with the boy , she instantly recognized who I was talking about I just kept wailing and saying something like his face doesn't look right anymore and just crying like they did something to me she said I was more terrified than sad. She said we're out looking for the boys mom. As in me and the boy went on a search for her, I can only remember walking out side the garages and through alleys I'd never seen before until I felt some sort of urge to run. My aunt says I wasn't gone for more than 15 minutes. Ive dreamt about this later in highschool after getting dumped but the dream end with me never coming back and being stuck in someones back yard and the more I run the longer the gate out seems. So she asked where the boy was I basically said he went home but I feel like I left him and ran for my own life. The eyes never bothered me before so for me to say something like his face is messed up scares me to this day. I don't think we really saw anyone. A part of me hopes it was just some imaginary friend because my mom says I had a few of those mother fuckers. My Godmother has seen things in her time in Mexico, horrible shit you'd never wish on your enemies of this world and our of it. If you believe in the truth then it's here.  if you're superstitious you'll just see a way out or like my Grandma says Find the Logic In The Unexplainable. My Godmother sees in the dark better than you and I which has always creeped the fuck out of me. Shes seen people come and go that aren't there and things with no explanation. Her tellings of these stories have never changed and it's kind of become a family tradition to tell horror stories fake or real just as a pass time but sometimes it gets really unnerving the whole family prays together. It sounds funny because why the hell would you want to see or feel it and once you do you run as far as can from it. I choose to only put faith in God as of a few years ago. I used to say the universe was bigger and had more than than one God. But once you accept him he can mock you for your own beliefs and it's not the way you'd imagine hearing voices and shit but the fact life will feel fucked or treacherous if you don't accept him, you won't want to you even cry and beg for your pain to go away to what ever it is you believe in but it never quite subsides. Im ranting about him because I'm fucking scared now almost 23 years old a guy and no balls from the looks of it.  She said the boy was nothing more than a shadows or a scrawny kid with a similar home life. I wasn't close to kids until I made it to elementary and even then I would just keep to myself or be in trouble because I was one of the Mexican kids in class in a white state. Blah blah blah racism isn't real. Once you've been brown or any other shade other than pale you're like a unicorn or some sort of artifact for everyones use or expense. My Grandfather and Grandmother had more Spaniard blood in them than I did they basically looked white until they spoke so being out public with them was like being adopted . I took after my dad and was bronze my first few years that dude is basically your stereotypical Mexican. Stereotypes aren't bad if anything helpful to recognize your own people and even then be weary because they'll let you in with open arms and eat you alive.  I've grown to be paranoid and aware of my surroundings always fighting or flying man cus fuck around and find out. My aunt said she only caught a glimpse of the boys eyes but isn't sure if they were truly different colors or if he had a dead eye all along we only let him out the moment he seemed to panic as she closed in on us but she said I was sitting in a particular spot where she could only see me and not the boy. And the last time I saw him she let me out because I wouldn't stop talking about the boy and how he said would meet outside. The time I came to ask her for the food was the same time I could remember seeing him coming down the stares and my aunt saying that wasn't possible because everything was closed and there was no way to come in , she made me the food for both of us sandwich juices and chips something a kid would eat . And I walked down the hall leading to dark garage bearly life my the office lights and sink station. The sink was next to the door leading to the garage which could be locked all the doors big and full metal to this date I don't know if they were made like that to prevent a intruders or or to keep something in. Like houses with iron bars on the windows. My Godmother sat in the office where they had a phone which I believe was all she did when no one was there or paper work for inventory but most time on gossip with who knows I can only remember a few times she would call me to say hi to my aunts. Back then you would've need cards to make out of country calls . She sat in the office where she could see me until then she wasnt so aware of anything then something made everything click how did that boy get in??? To this day we don't know where he went or what was of him. Or why I would say he came from upstairs or why I can remember that and I know she asked if I was lying because I would've balled my eyes out if she didn't believe me. So when I dream about my brother that boy shows up and its like it's him the longer I observe him I become aware I'm dreaming and I wake up not really remembering any details. I know if I saw him id recognize him. I dream about my brother, but he dies or makes me keep going while he stays behind. I dreamt we were in a Costco like store mix with hardware and other crap but he's at the registers flirting with some lady trying to get a discount or something while I walk past him and fill a cart with anything and everything that I want it's usually toys and random shit after a while the dreams get dark like no light but still tangible. I know the difference between bad dreams and nightmares. A nightmare will make you want to wake up it will tell you you're dreaming but you can't you have to finish it or die to wake up. Bad dreams are the weird shit you repress or have to cringe at when you wake up because had it happened in reality either you'd be some sort of chump or be on the run. I dreamt about working at a Taco Bell and half way through my shift I felt like I was dreaming it  felt so good I looked at my coworker and said man I'm so high right now why would even let be on the line and he just chuckled or said something I laughed at. Then as it's closing time I can see what are ""friends"" waiting outside telling me to take the train with them it's this heavy woman blonde red cheeks likes she's drunk her boyfriend a blonde guy spikey hair and rough beard almost like he was trying to shave into a style but gave up half way as if just to leave and get to my job quickly, they looked panicked or as if holding some sort secret they really nagged me almost like it wasn't a choice. The other dude was more my age but I could tell he wasn't fully there either. I felt like we all got super high the night before and they were on a really bad comedown. The tone shifted when they pulled away and gave me nasty looks like I said something wrong I just couldn't go with them because someone was waiting for me at my old apartment. At that point I told them I couldn't go and I was really sorry for making them come out but to begin with I never asked them to meet me up. I really felt some murderous intent and said nah. And just woke up. I don't know if I fucking died or it was just time to get up. I don't like to dream anymore before when I dream the drugs feel real almost like a key to some puzzle left in realitys between what is and what isn't. I wanted to die so bad one time I didn't even know what I was doing I just wanted the pain to end . It felt like I wasn't doing what I was sent here for the but just being a disgrace. That day I was on what was 8th of shrooms. It wasn't the last time or the first  I did psychedelics/hallucinogens. That day I felt this nasty pain in my soul almost like I had broken a rule by existing. I cried with my friends and told them how much I love them. WE ALL KNOW A GUY LIKE THAT. except I'm that guy to them. Especially when drunk.  I'm barely a few hours into this shit and I just up and leave half way through crying in the mud. They never told me anything bad about how I was acting but just that I kind of worried them that I might hurt myself they didn't want to let me leave but they knew I would probably fight them if I didn't. We all came from righteous religious parents so we knew better than to call cops or family in times like this all we had each other bothers threw drugs. You don't want that kind of friends and it took me a few more trips to realize that I was the problem, we all had this codependent nature to us. Eventually one of my friends got married and moved in with her and her family tell me is that cool?  The other brother lives with his grandmother last I heard from him. But eventually all that came together. I could feel the envy of being on my own or doing as I pleased. I worked for my money so I could use my money on me or occasionally help my mom but my mom rarely liked to take money from me. My friends had no jobs but addictions. The one that got married started to steal from us and would act stupid as if ""oh you know what you're right "". I lost batteries that cost 200 for some fucking weed that wouldn't last so now I truly hope he's using them or sold them to feed himself and his wife. And the other dude lost his family and friends based on what they did to him his dog died sometime in between weeks of us getting high he came to me asking if there was a way to bring his dog back I almost laughed at him but I could hear it in his voice he was serious. He said I was weird and that I probably knew a way to do it. Up to this point I thought I was just allowed to hang out because I was pot head. I've never told them any of the weird shit in my family and even now ranting doesn't bother because it's all lost in the sands of time. So it's me and his girlfriend, she was on some anti psychotics and add drugs to the mix fuck what terrible person she was around to be with. At this point I met Lust and what it really is , it's a sick depravity that will flaunt itself to you wanting you to fall and fall hard. He would always and I say this like this because its the way I saw it he would molest her in front of me as if expecting me to join or say something he would do it staring into my eyes. Every mother fucker with biblical name is sick or fucked mentally somehow so I thank God for giving me my father's name something finally different. So this girl is into it and she plays into it I don't know if they both knew what they were doing or it was the heat of the moment. Keep in mind I'm in the back seat of his car still think about the dead dog Id seen a week prior and to think of it he was still spry and full of energy no where near the end of his life . Sometime between seeing the dog and that day he met that chick. I'm not using names because the truth always finds it's way into the light. So if you know who you are fuck right off my dudes. Not even gonna mention the dogs name in respect of his passing. So they're almost getting it on while I'm in the back seat Total 3rd wheel and the worst part I was still so attached to my ex at this point had to mention her btw because it's literally the one thing keeping me from screaming or yelling stop. In highschool we would make out in the hallways and would yelled at by teachers for PDA. That whole time she has her eyes closed and my boy is eyes fucking me I felt like I couldn't run because he was my ride home and he knew I needed him to get around because when he would say oh we're going out come with pussy I'd just tag along because neither of us had friends in highschool so it seemed to make sense to hang out because he wasn't so far from where I lived and we both loved weed. Weed was my ex after she left me I would sit and talk to her while rolling up and then as I finished smoking I said my goodbyes, my boys would joke around saying if you drop the blunt they're fucking your bitch. So i lived by that and if you smoked with a white lighter you basically were gonna die so any bic lighters with plastic wrapper were the exception . Me and this dude were so close we could share a black n mild if we ran out of everything. I started doing harder drugs because I didn't want to be myself anymore until that one day.  So these two animals are about to breed as I immediately suggested we should go to a Petco. They said yeah dude let's go some shit like I just wanted out it felt like the start of a horror movie where nobody gives a shit and they all do the stupid crap until it really blows up into there face.

Gray asphalt echoes
the tire-tread whispers of journeys made and forgotten.
Apartments rise like tired dreams,
their faces blank-eyed windows,
catching fragments of sunlight breaking through
the heavy quilt of January clouds.

Red cars, white vans, black sedans,
all parked still in the hollows of purpose,
waiting for their owners to return—
the hum of engines silent,
replaced by the hum of a world holding its breath.
The sun fights, slicing through steel-gray skies,
spilling gold on the asphalt canvas.

A wind stirs the cold air,
bringing whispers of voices long lost
and the unspoken poetry of the ordinary:
families upstairs, coffee brewing,
a child’s laughter seeping through the cracks.

This moment—
this parking lot symphony of nothing,
of everything—
we are all passengers,
watching the sky burn gold
before the night pulls its curtain shut.

1i6x1hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikerjedi/comments/1i6x1hd/snow_day/,Snow Day.,"It's snowing in Florida. Not totally out of this world, but it is rare. What is unusual is the amount of accumulation and how far south it is going. My county is under a winter storm advisory for the first time in history. Pretty wild. School is open tomorrow though, so I don't think we are actually getting snow. How wild would it be to get a snow day in Florida?

January 11th, 1992 was a Friday. I was stationed at Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas pending my discharge in couple of months. A desert environment on the border with Mexico. The desert could get cold at night. It had been cold the night before, but I didn't think much of it as I turned in for the night. Morning PT had already been cancelled, but our first formation was still on as far as I knew.

Overnight, the temps really dropped and we got 3 inches of snow according to the historical record I found. So next to nothing for someone who grew up in Colorado, Illinois and Germany. Although I am sure there were some huskies living there that were thrilled, the people weren't. For the city of El Paso, it was extremely unusual, and people promptly freaked out. 

I woke up, got my day started, got on my uniform and stepped outside the apartment. Snow on the ground. Dafuq? I wanted to slap myself awake. I stood on my doorstep, coffee in one hand and keys in the other. I took a sip as I contemplated this white stuff on the ground. It was snow alright. I had last seen it in Korea. In any case, it wasn't a big deal for me - I could drive in this. As I stepped away from my door, I heard my phone ringing, but didn't want to go in to answer it. I got the truck warmed up and left for post to go to work.

On the way out, came upon a neighbor whose car had stalled out. We popped the hood, and I noticed their carb wasn't opening all the way. So I got a screwdriver to pop the valve open while they started it, and it fired right up. It was just cold, and I showed them what to do if it died again. 

Leaving the apartment complex and heading to post, I saw quite a few accidents. All of them were caused by excessive speed. Everyone seemed OK as I passed and there wasn't shit I could do, so I kept going. My truck was light in the ass end and didn't do great in the snow, but I went slow enough it was OK. I listened to the radio. The airport was cancelling flights. Schools were closing. Police were encouraging you to self-report car accidents the next day as they were overwhelmed.

I finally parked at the unit and walked in. The CO, XO and First Sergeant were in. They were standing around the CQ desk talking. *""Cobb - didn't you get the message?""* Ah, the phone call I didn't take. Turned out Fort Bliss had gone to essential personnel only. The rest of the junior enlisted living in the barracks were upstairs, sleeping in. So after some more of the Army famous ""hurry and wait"", the CO finally sent the few of us there home for the day. The snow was mostly gone in the morning, and life returned to normal. 

I get that they weren't used to dealing with it, but that little bit of snow shut everything down. The whole city was acting like it was the End Times. Parts of Florida are behaving that way right now with the snow coming in. I have a mutt who thinks she is part Husky and is loving the cold. (She isn't - she is an American Airhead and Chaos Hound mix.) I do kinda wish we would get snow so she could see it. What really sucks is I'm home sick and have been sick since Thursday. Being immuno-compromised sucks big time. I'm supposed to take two busses of students on a field trip tomorrow, and I seriously don't think I'm going to make it. 

Not a snow day, but a sick day instead. Ugh. Just had some chicken soup, so that always makes me feel (emotionally) better at least.

Clouded sky gives way to milky dark water. Cold snow holds the ground. Mountains stare and watch unrestrained. Uncaring wind speaks softly through the trees. A cold man sits on the bench. 



It’s a beautiful day today. It’s calm and peaceful. I’d love this kind of day under normal circumstances. I always liked the cold and snow. When the hustle of humanity would be forced to slow down as the new year passes. On a normal day, I would find myself here. But it’s been three weeks since I’ve seen another living thing, and I’m scared. 



It happened without any fanfare. I didn’t see the sky open up and everyone else flying away. I simply awoke to a vacuous world. No animals, people, insects, or the like. Though everyone didn’t leave peacefully it seems. My house was left mostly untouched, but all the surrounding houses are… well ruined. Some have all their windows busted, doors falling off their hinges and hastily moved luggage strewn about. It looked as if some people were preparing to leave in a hurry and others were simply torn away. Whatever happened, I had missed the train ride to hell. I slept through the rapture. 



I wasn’t in my home when I awoke, though. Not only that, but I was sitting here looking out at the lake with no memory of ever coming here. There was little to no wind. Silence held its grip over all. The only sound I heard was the faint laps of the lake water sliding to shore. I stood dazed and looked around. I found a lonesome shoe sitting in the dead grass a distance away. Looking towards the park of which this bench is a part of I saw empty and smashed cars. 

Quietly, I walked my way up the road towards the highway. Along the way I saw torn bits of clothing but no blood. No bodies. There was a deep rip in the dirt where presumably someone driving away hit the edge hard and tore away at the ground. Getting to the highway, I just saw a few wrecked cars and some simply abandoned. Turning right, I headed towards the super 8 market. “A grocery store with a little bit of everything!” As the ad always read. 

Remembering this walk still chills my heart and threatens me with such dread. Seeing the simple yet all encompassing damage the world had taken. Shattered glass here with some thrown about debris there.  Nothing was freshly torn apart or newly broken and spilling. It all seemed to happen a day or two ago. I was so terrified making my way back through town. It had just started to snow then. 

Finally getting to my home and seeing it still standing was the first relieving thing I’d seen. My neighbors roof had partially caved in as snow covered her living room. Katie lived alone like me. Now she’s gone too. I realize how badly I miss our brief talks. She made the mundane topics of life seem so easy and nice. I never got the nerve to ask her to dinner. What a mistake. 

My other neighbor on the west side had a torn off door and smashed front window, but it’s all mostly still there. He was an old fellow whom I rarely ever talked to but was always very friendly. His wife died some years ago, and I feel he was waiting out his time. Nothing there now. 

My house was the same as the two flanking it, though in much better shape. One floor, two bedroom, one bath. When I stepped inside, my body heaved with exhaustion. The shear stress of making it back home was overwhelming. The kitchen to the right was as I left it. Semi clean. The living room to the left was also as it should be. Couch in front of the window facing a tv sitting on a pioneer stereo. Further down the hall I see the bathroom is fine. My guest room to the right still had nothing but storage in it. Random boxes of left over things. I never use the room for anything else. And finally to the left was my bedroom. Queen-sized bed with one night stand and a full closet. Simple. Nothing more nothing less. 



I live in northern Montana in the town called Kalitfish. A very small town of about 5,000. We sit at the top of lake Rockhead, facing south. The nearest town is over an hour away, and in any other apocalyptic event, I’d say this wouldn’t be too bad a spot to hold out. But with everything gone I’d say I’m dead already. I’ve been scrounging for food around here as best I can, but there really isn’t much left. I got left the scraps. If I could find a vehicle with gas still in it, I don’t really know where I would go. I imagine the rest of the world is like this. Yes, I’d get more food but what then? Plus it’s been snowing a good bit up here already and by this point the roads are probably impassable. 



I had hung around my house in a haze of crying and confused disbelief for a few days. Using up my currently available resources. I didn’t dare make too much noise, for a time when I didn’t know if whatever took everyone might have still been around. But by about the 6th day I went out to the street in a grief riddled daze and started to scream. Hoping to call whatever took them all away would come get me. But nothing ever came. 

I calmed myself down and reset my mind. Simply trying to rationalize what my situation is. Then I went exploring. 

A bit more confident after not getting immediately killed by some creature, I poked into some houses to see what I can gather. Some untouched houses had some good stuff. One had half a pantry of canned beans. Some real survival shit there. Others were pretty cleaned out, and some had been damaged and rotted beyond safe traversal. 

Whatever took, everyone really wasn't concerned about how. And the ones being taken did whatever they could to try and get away. Which left me having to pick at ripped rice bags. 



Going into the rest of my little town, I found more destruction. The snow was piling up pretty good down Main Street. Some cars on the strip were actually not all that bad. One SUV was in very good shape compared to all I’ve seen. However, it didn’t have anything of use in it. Just an insurance card in the glove box. 

Many of the shops were broken and disheveled. The Electronica shop looked to have been looted in someone’s last ditch attempt at a new CRT. It lay smashed on the ground some feet away from the window. 

 I had to dig my way into the hardware shop. It was particularly bad in here. Several shelves were knocked over, and the register was in pieces. Tools, wires, and PVC pipes were strung out everywhere. A hole in the corner part of the roof let in a stream of white snow. Still warmer than outside, but much too cold to stay. I had gone in there to grab myself a pad lock because I had started to… act up at night.



 I don’t know if it’s the stress or if I’m simply going off it, but I’ve started to sleepwalk. And I mean really hard. The first night it happened, I slept very soundly. But at about 2:00 I woke up and found myself standing at the end of my bed facing my door. It concerned me because I’ve never had bouts of sleeping walking before, but under the current circumstances I guessed it was stress and moved on. The next night I woke up about the same time, but I was facing my front door. Though just my body was. My head was fully turned to the right and looked at my living room. Like I was taking it in before leaving the house. I was suitably freaked out by what my body was doing whilst I slept. I decided to give myself a huge “day off” to try and alleviate this problem. Staying inside and trying to live my normal routine while the outside froze. The power has somehow been able to stay on this entire time. Damn lucky with how the weathers been. 

The third night made me get the padlock. 



I awoke to the bitter biting of freezing wind and snow. My eyes barely could open to see where I even was with how bad it was blowing that night. I quickly turned around hoping to find my house and yes, it was there. Except it was five houses away from me. The only reason why I could even see it was because I left the porch light on. Half freezing to death, I had been walking down the middle of the road towards the Super 8. Still in my pajamas and completely bare foot. I ran towards home. The howling of the wind in my ears was driving me wild. Getting in, I slammed the door behind me. Barely able to move my hands, I struggled to lock the door. The warmth of the house stung, as it always did when you go from very cold to very warm. In my sleep delirium I had managed to unlock the bolt and handle locks, open the door, close it behind me and head out. Entirely ignoring the burst of cold and the stabs of snow hitting my face. 

The other houses looked creaturely that night. Bulky shadows staring at me as I ran. Mouths agape, beckoning me in for their warmth. The thrown around clothes looked like long frozen bodies. The fly traps droppings. Scraps. 

Needless to say, I was very prompt in my decision to get that pad lock. 



Returning from the hardware store, my neighbors homes didn’t look so hungry anymore. Emaciated, but not out to get me. I took my time putting up the new lock. I wanted to make sure it was plenty secure for the next night. 

Which brings me back here. To the bench. I wanted to look out over the lake. Since the first night I started to sleepwalk, I’ve had such an impenetrable sense of pure dread. I feel something is coming or something is happening. I’m honestly scared to sleep tonight. My tongue is dry, and my leg won’t stop shaking. Despite all this, I still feel so tired. Like I’m full of sand. Pulling me down.  

Ugh, I really don’t want to sleep tonight. But I’m fading fast here. 



The snow is coming down steady, like it has been. If I don’t starve first, I’ll be buried. My walk back is even quieter than before because of this. Despite being in the frozen wastes for three weeks, I’m still scared I’ll turn a corner and find something awful waiting. Or that I’ll be found by something awful. 

Making my way through the roads on about the same path I took the first day I woke up, I'm as scared now as I was then. The cars are now just mounds of snow. Vague lumps like a dream of a highway. It’s a struggle to get through all this. And it’s very, very cold. In some way, the cold helps me move through the powder by making it somewhat solid. But that’s about all it does. If I get out of this somehow, if everything was just some horrid nightmare, I’m moving to somewhere hot all year round. I hate snow. 

The super 8 looks of a monument to ice and concrete. So desolate and foreboding. I used to work there. Had a decent position stocking shelves and handling every merchant that we did business with. There was just enough people to keep it pretty busy most times. Jake was a great friend and fellow employee. Worked hard and always had something dumb to say. Seeing it so dark makes me sad. The inside is completely ransacked by me and those who were taken before.



Approaching my street I hear something. I stop stock still. I strain to hear through the ashen flakes. 



\*thwump\* 



I drop to the ground, sliding myself to a snow drift just to my left. Breathing wildly. It came from across the street. I think the red-ish house. Oh, god, what is it. Nothing has made a sound since this all started. I try to calm my heaving breath while I peek over the drift. Nothing but snow. The house is no more special than mine. Its door is closed and the windows intact. I can’t remember if I went inside that one. I don’t think I did, no. So I have no reference for what could have made that sound. I stare into the white, straining to see or hear anything that might give a hint. Nothing. I slide back down and sat. Giving my adrenaline time to subside. My current guess is maybe the snow on the roof got too heavy and slid off one side. Would explain the size of the sound. 

Paranoid.

Giving myself one last deep breath, I get up, brush myself off and start towards my home again. Keeping my eye on the house for which the sound came from. I don’t see where from the roof some snow had dropped. There’s no bare patch of shingles. I look towards the door. Wait, was it always cracked open? No, I saw it was closed. But maybe from my previous angle I couldn’t see the slight opening? The obsidian abyss behind it pierces my soul. I pick up the pace as I just get past the home and the front door goes just out of sight. I turn, facing where I’m walking. I start to run. 

Nothing gave chase. 



Getting inside I immediately lock everything up. I fumble with the new padlock from the fear of something reaching out to grab me. Once it’s done I back away from the door, staring at it. Waiting for something to thud, bang on the door, scream after me. But nothing did. 

My body relaxes after I stand for what seemed like hours staring at the front door. I must be losing it. It’s not impossible for something to thud out there. The whole world has been ransacked. There’s no doubt that it was just some snow falling off whatever roof. I grab some food and sit on my couch. I stare at my empty tv, reflecting on my own mind, and try not to overthink. My eyes begin to falter. That little bout of terror and running exhausted my already tired body further. I hadn't forgotten about my sleepwalking. I should get to my bed but… I’m so tired. 



2



A broken window gnashes its shards. The wind goes from screaming to howling, crying to weeping. A house delves deeper into frozen depths. Then the land falls silent. A cold man stands by the lake. 



I awake violently. The jolt about knocks me over, but I catch myself. Looking down, I see I still have my boots on? Along with pebbles and rocks of all shapes and sizes. Dark-colored eyes all looking at me. I begin to feel the cold. I quickly look up and see nothing but water. I’m at the lake shore. Spinning around, I see the rest of the park buried in snow. The bench, however, is not covered at all. In fact, it’s stopped snowing entirely, as if to keep the bench untouched by ice. 

The clouds are still grey above me. Looking back towards the shore I see the long wooden dock stretch out into the vast lake. The snow on the dock seems to be disturbed. With my mind still fogged from waking up in such a state, I walk over to see how exactly it’s been disturbed. What I find is mortifying. 

There are clear footprints here. I would think they’re mine seeing as I’m the only one here and clearly the pad lock didn’t work. But… it looks like whoever was walking was dripping wet. The signs of water falling on snow. The odd holes and preserved splash marks like an avant-garde painting.  Except I’m not soaking wet at all. My sleeping body didn’t just go out for a swim. In fact, I’m covered head to toe with all my regular snow gear. Thick wool shirt, two jackets, long Johns, snow pants and boots. I couldn’t be more dry and warm out here.  

These aren’t my prints. 

The shoe size is just too small and that in itself isn’t right. They are “shoe” prints, not my boot prints.  They look like office shoes. There’s someone else here.  



With terror striking its way up my spine, I scan the park for anyone. My breathing is getting heavier by the second. I don’t see anything, and without the snowfall I’m able to see much clearer. Helpful and all the more horrible. I see the tracks make their way towards the little road leading out of the park. Whoever it is had left. But they put themselves between me and home now. 

I make my way along the tracks. Keeping hyper vigilant of any sound or movement. My eyes dance from one blinding white lump to the next. Scanning past every tree to catch an angle on whoever was taking a stroll. Fear soaking every movement I make.  I continue to follow the tracks, and they in turn continue to make their way towards my home. On the highway, I see they go right down the middle of the road. Only veering slightly from the double yellow lines. Or where they would be under all the powder. I’m creeping as best I can whilst trying to contain my breathing and clear my mind. I need to be as calm and alert as possible. 

The tracks keep going. And going. All the way until my road splits off to the right and the tracks go up a small ridge towards the super 8 market. Slightly relieved to see they don’t go toward my house I stop by a shed nearby and survey.

There are two car lumps on the road to my right and some streetlamp poles to my left. I can just see the top of the building over the ridge. The grand super 8 sign stands tall above. The lights beaming upwards cast an eerie amber glow. I now notice they stand out so much because it’s getting darker. I don’t know what time it is, but I feel it’s not the sun setting, rather the clouds darkening further with threats of even more snow. And it’s probably going to be a blizzard.



I want to go home. I need to go home, but… those prints are “human”. If by some miracle someone crawled their way back from the void, I imagine they aren’t in good shape. Besides, if they are soaking wet, that’s death in this cold. They may need help. I don’t know how they would have gotten here, but I also don’t know why everyone left in the first place. Anything is on the table. 

I stand, dreading my decision. I follow the tracks again. Still being as careful as I can be with snow up to my thighs, I make my way to the ridge. Laying in the fluff just before the top and peeking over. The super 8 looms like a castle beyond the parking lot. And standing just before it is a shape. A dark pillar. A person. 

I try to catch more details, but at this distance and in the low light I can’t make out much. They aren’t very short. Maybe, say, six foot? Male by the blocky stature. They’re not wearing a jacket. Just standing. Could be swaying slightly. 

Oh, please just let me leave. 

I stand and walk. 

This is insanity. 

I continue standing tall. 

About halfway through the parking lot, I can see that they have dark hair. 

Jesus, it really is a person. 

Further on, I walk. 

Closer, I can tell they’re still wet. 

How haven’t they been frozen yet they’re soaked! 

At 20 feet away, I call out.



“Hey!” 



My voice shakes my heart. Skipping a beat. 

The world seems to reel from the sound. The person stops swaying and starts to turn. As they do, I begin to smell something off. It’s the smell of lake water. The smell of waterlogged dead wood. A tinge of rotting fish and a miasma of algae. I realize my horrible mistake of coming here. 

They turn further. Slowly, allowing me all the time to see them. It is a man in what looks like a two-piece suit. It’s dark with moisture. His hands are grayish. Ears are almost white. The face isn’t there. He has no features on that shaggy haired ball. It’s just waves of faint light and a stretched hole delving deep into his head. 

I begin to tremble with mortification and disgust. Despite his lack of mouth he speaks. It comes in putrid stutters. Foaming, bubbling, coughing words spray forth. 



“…is deep-p-p….d-dar-rk…beautiful-l-l…” 



Water streams down his pale neck. 

My eyes stare wild. I can’t move! I can’t run!

More gurgling emerges from the man. He takes one lumbering step towards me. I’m frozen but screaming inside. Run damnit! 

The man’s hand begins to twitch violently. Twisted spasms take his fingers and bend them in all directions impossible to the human hand. The sudden movement kicks my legs into overdrive. I run right. Lunging through the snow as fast as I can manage. Stupid terror sprints through my senses. I’m numb with it. I recognize the drift where I once hid before and head to the other side, trying to break line of sight. I continue up my road, heaving my legs through the darkening wastes. Small flecks begin to fall once more. I didn’t even notice the wind starting to scream. 



I burst inside my home and, faster than I’ve ever before, lock the door. I jump over to the front window and draw the curtains. Panting I stop to assess. 

“Ok…ok. That thing probably didn’t see me head off here.” 

Then realization strikes me. 

“Oh god-damn, my tracks!” I half shout, startling myself. The exact way I found him is how he’ll find me. I have to do something. I look out my front window. The snow is starting to really come down. The wind is streaming the fluffy crystals forward at an alarming speed. Something catches my eye through the veil. The houses across the street look squashed. No, they look completely collapsed. Sunken. I run to my small kitchen window. The old man’s house is just four vacant walls now. Absolutely ruined. Knowing how Katie’s house looked, I assume it’s even worse now. My house seems to be the only place nearby that isn’t a pile of wood and shingles. 

“I’m a shining beacon for that thing to come knocking now.”

I slump next to my counter. 

“I’m screwed. So screwed.” I let out a small laugh at my situation. 

“What the hell did I do in life to get this shit of a straw.”

I don’t know what to do. My mind swims with the horrors. His soaking wet body. His hole face that bubbled with words. He must have just come from the lake.

“Whatever the hell that means.” I softly speak. 

 I decide that lying down and letting whatever he is take me might be worse than freezing or starving. So I start barricading myself in. Get my couch barred against the front door. Rip off cabinet doors to patch up the windows. One in the kitchen, one in the living room, and one above my bed. I brace my coffee table against the couch to further stop anything from even attempting coming through. My bed frame was just big enough to cover my larger front window. There are enough cracks for me to see through to the white hell burning outside. I refuse to sleep tonight. I set my tv on the floor next to the living room window. White knuckling a steak knife. Watching. 



My bedside clock reads 11:45. It’s pitch black out. I don’t have any lights on, hoping to not attract any more attention. I’ve been scanning the street for anything besides snow to shamble by. Waiting for him to show up at my door. 

The wind has done nothing but howl. Screeching around my home with reckless disregard for anything not nailed down. The flakes falling now are thick to an unholy degree. Snowballs pelting my poor town to death. Burying its corpse. Entombing me. Trying to listen through the wind is fruitless. Its cacophony is unsettling and forceful. Even if I did want to sleep it would be a struggle. 

I’ve managed well to stay awake so far, but there’s plenty of night to come. My bone's creek from sitting in this mummified position. Staring relentlessly, my eyes are dry and my head hurts. A dull pulse, most likely due to the drop in adrenaline. My feet ache from these ill-fitting boots. I’m not risking taking all my gear off just in case I decide to pass out and leave once again. Though that would be quite the task now. I’m really feeling the effects of my mad dash home. My mind still spins with the soaked man’s image. 

The clock reads midnight. 



3 



Deep sharp snow piercing through cloth. Oceans of shale clouds crash above. Ever gentle flakes fall without a word. Icy footsteps. A cold man lies on the ground. 



 My head rings with pain. My left eye sees through a red tint. Through my fogged vision, I see nothing but white. I’m outside again. But the clouds seem very close. I open my eyes wide to try and understand what I’m looking at. It’s my ceiling, not clouds. So I’m still inside. I groan as the rest of me wakes up. My right side ribs scream out in protest. My left foot cries. The cold nibbles at my skin. What happened? 

Through much effort and even more pain, I gradually sit up. My world spins for a sec and I almost vomit. My home is a mess. From where I’m sitting at the left wall of the living room, I see destruction. The tv is shattered. The stereo is thrown on its side and smashed. Almost all the drawers in the kitchen have been strung out and tossed. There are splotches of blood. The floor is sopping wet and snow is lightly floating in from the hall. 

I sit trying to understand what happened. I can’t remember much. What I do remember comes in flashes. I see my bathroom and the one small window smashed in. The one I forgot. The one I expected nothing to be able to get through. Then I remember pain. Images of something hitting me appear as consciousness leaks back into me. My head got rammed against the hallway wall. I was thrown. I fought back with animal like cruelty. Then all blank from there. 

My barricades are still standing where I fastened them before. Though they had clearly taken a beating. I try to stand and through so much pain I make it upright. Leaning against the wall and holding my side, I peer around the corner towards my bathroom. Snow is pouring in from outside. It’s light out and not at all windy but still snowing like mad. I look at my guest room. The door is on the floor but not much inside the room seems not to have been touched. Then I look to my bedroom. The door is in half and I can’t see into the room at all from where I’m leaning.  

I take a few short breaths and start to slide my way along the hallway to take in the damage. 



\*crack\* 



I freeze. Silence engulfs the house. I hold my breath, listening. 



\*snap\* 



Another deep pop follows. Then another. 

I stand straight up and start to back away from the bedroom. My eyes stare at the doorway, split between red and normal vision. My left eye is just a fuzzy mess from the blood that has leaked into it. But I know what I’m seeing. 

A gray, festering hand grabs the door frame. Gripping hard it pulls. A carpeted sliding follows the movement. The hand grabs further in the hall, ripping at the floor. I back away further but fall, not noticing the end of the wall. Pain rings out in my mind. The hand takes no time to keep pulling. Shaggy leach like hair appears. Its pitted face emerges slobbering. Gurgling fills the room. The soaked man sloughs further forward.  His left shoulder is dangling well behind where it should be. Holding by a thread of rubbery flesh and cloth. He pulls further. I scoot myself back towards my living room unable to look away. My mind screams with fear. The soaked man sings. 

“..is deep-p .. i-is da-a-rk… is beautiful..”

He spasms again violently, this time his head rakes right around. Fully breaking its own neck. And yet, he still pulls. And yet, he still sings. 

“…s-soo daaark-k … sooo..DEEP…so beautiful..”

As he pulls more, his head slowly twists back into place. Making rancid sounds of bone snapping and clumping back into place. 

I’ve seen enough. I have to leave. 

He continues forward along the ground crawling at me. All the while he sings the same phrase over and over and over. I spin around and start tearing at the bed frame. I rip my nail of my right middle finger. I don’t even flinch from the pain. I tear more boards away. 

“….daa-ark…”

More sounds of horrible spasms and crushing bone. 

“ …and beautifu-ll”

Thick wet snaps like breaking zucchini. 

I tear enough away to get to the window. I start to punch at the glass. 

“..iiiiSs-ss deeeeeep..”

My fist is bloody, but it’s working. 

I hear a wet snipping sound, followed by a weak “thwump” on the carpet. I take half a look behind me. The soaked man is standing now, and his arm has finally fallen away. I start to scream as I punch through the glass. It tears up my jacketed arm and draws blood. I squirm my way through the now shattered window. Getting glass stuck in my hands and knees as I escape. I braced myself expecting a small fall but the snow is so built up I just slide out. Pain swallows me. I regain my feet and limply begin to run. I look back as I go, just in time to catch a madly spiraling hand rip through the opening. Finding nothing, the hand recedes. 



I force myself to keep a steady but horribly painful pace. I can’t see more than a house away. A deep fog has laid itself down on Kalitfish. I frantically look for anything I can run too. The house closest to me is nothing but splinters and a mailbox. I limp forward. The next house comes into view, but it’s just the front facing wall left. 

“Damnit why” I whimper

Just then I look farther down the road and see and orange glow. The grand Super 8 sign lights beckon me towards them. I run. 

The snow trailing behind me has streaks of red. Painting a grizzly image. Some drifts reach up to my face in impenetrable mounds. I run around them, trying to keep the lights within my sight. My focus is purely on those lights, but in my peripheral I catch a human figure just a few feet from me on my right. I don’t stop. I hear more gurgling. Higher pitched than the soaked man’s normal babbling. Further on, I get a glimpse of two figures off to my left. One was on the ground but still reaching up towards the second. The other stood over them with an axe. She took the others legs. I pass, stifling a scream as I hear them both sing that broken tune. More sickly voices sing to my right, but I don’t see where from. I’m just a block away from the lights. 

I’ve lost my left boot at some point. I don’t pay it a moments thought before I realize I made it. The snow thins out significantly going on the blacktop parking lot. I move closer to the sign. It’s lights blazing upward letting me read “SUPER 8 MARKET”

However, the lights are shining off something else. No, this is wrong. The sign is now standing dead center in front of the main building. It’s no longer at the edge of the lot. I slow my approach. The sign stands proud right in front of the entrance. The building has become a brutalist symbol of horror. No paint, no other windows, just one gaping maw and the depths of an abyss within. 



I stand defeated. This world won’t let me be. It just led me to something else. I don’t know what I was expecting. 

“Fucking why?!” I scream into the void. 

A smell answers me. I retch instantly. Heaving, I fall to my knees. Giving up my guts from the smell. It’s like the soaked man but far stronger. The smell of rot way more present than ever before. With my eyes bulging, I look up towards the opening. I see a glint of very faint orbs flash in the dark. Metallic eyes stare back at me. Something heard me. 

A sixteen fingered hand smashes down through the doorway. I feel as its immense force rattles the ground. The arm is a sinewy mess of very skinny and taught, to bulging tumorous masses. The color like that of dead bodies. The texture was smooth like dolphin's skin. The hand flexes as a wet squelching sliding sound rings out. 

A failed imitation of a head and face comes forth. Great mercury eyes gaze crazily at me. Two small, bottomless pupils spill into my mind. Making me feel like my head is splitting open. The mouth a gash where one would think to add it. A viscous drool slides down its chin. Another many fingered hand reaches forward. Bloats of puss stick out around its wrist. It’s long pale fingernail pokes at my temple. 

I scream. 

 Thousands of voices scream at my consciousness. All saying: 



“The lake is oh so beautiful. So deep. So dark. The lake is loving and sweet. So sensual and lustful”



I scream louder. I scream harder. I scream until I see blood fly out of my mouth. I scream until darkness fill my mind. I scream until my head splits in two. 



4



As I sit up, I feel the bench below me. The world is silent once again, bar the sound of the waves hitting the shore. I can’t see the mountains or any distant landmark. Nothing but the beautiful lake. It’s so calming and peaceful. I stand and find my body bleeding and ravaged. I’m also covered in a sticky substance. It makes my skin feel itchy. I need to wash off. The lake calls me. 



“Wash”



“I feel unclean.”



“Wash”



“I will. I need to for you”



“Come”



“Oh yes, thank you”



I start to walk to the water



“Oh look at your waves. Such curves and swirls”



“Further”



“Oh wonderful.”



My feet hit the tide



“Ah how cold and refreshing”



“Further”



“Yes. Your crisp currents pull at me”



I wade up to my thighs

I begin shaking uncontrollably



“oh the relief”



“Wash. Further”



“Yes. Your deep takes me”



It’s up to my chest



“Oh, your strength humbles me so”



“Further”



“I shall drink from your dark heart.”



It’s up to my neck



“Such beauty. The sensations”



“Further”



“Oh.”



I’m shivering wildly



“I…s-so….cold”



“Further”



The water takes me.



“C-cold”



A sublime heart is steadied. The mountains close ever hateful eyes. The wind rests its soul. The snow glimmers in the sunlight. Man’s machinery echoes through the trees. Mounds are scattered.

A cold man sinks below.

I am actually really sad that this relationship is over, in different circumstances I would have been friends with this person, and I honestly feel they enjoyed my company too.

So I’ve been on the lookout for a nice gourmand winter scent that is coffee forward. I’ve narrowed it based on other reviews and budget to Coffee Addict by Theodoros Kalotinis or Turmeric Latte by LUSH. 

I have not tried Coffee Addict yet but from people’s reviews online and on Reddit, it’s pretty accurate to a fresh cup of coffee, it’s fairly long lasting, and has moderate to good projection(plus it’s moderately priced at $55 for 50 ml). I tried Turmeric Latte in-store and I really liked it because it smells just like a spiced chai latte, but it’s pretty pricey ($65 for 30ml, or $130 for 100ml). 

Any opinions on which I should go for? Has anyone tried both? Right now the LUSH one is still available at my local mall, but I know it’s a seasonal scent and it won’t be there for long. ",1,1737502626.0,FemFragLab,0,0.67,False

I exist, suspended—
Not in chaos, not in calm,
but in the endless, restless in-between.

I wake up to a fog that doesn’t belong to the sun or the storm.
It’s not screaming, not silence—
just the hum of thoughts too loud to ignore
and too quiet to explain.

I drink my coffee and wonder if this is the day
I’ll do all the things I promised myself
or if I’ll sit, still as stone,
watching hours melt into shadows on my walls.

I think about the calls I haven’t returned,
the texts I’ve read a dozen times,
the ""how are you?""s I can’t answer because I’m not sure myself.
I’ve been “fine” so often it’s practically my name now.

This isn’t the worst of it,
but it’s not good, either.
It’s not screaming into pillows
or feeling like my chest is full of broken glass,
but it’s not peace.
It’s just this:
a thousand unfinished things,
a million unsaid words.

I want to be better,
but some days, I don’t even know what “better” is.
Is it finishing the laundry?
Calling my mom back?
Or is it just making it to the next minute
without collapsing under the weight of my own mind?

People ask, ""What’s wrong?""
How do I explain that it’s everything and nothing?
That I’m not drowning,
but the water’s up to my chin,
and I’m so tired of treading it alone?

Somewhere between the manic highs
and the rock-bottom lows,
there’s this middle ground
that doesn’t feel like a ground at all.
It feels like quicksand,
slowly pulling me down
while I smile and pretend it’s a beach day.

This isn’t the worst of it,
but it’s not easy, either.
And if you’re here, in this middle, too,
just know—I see you.
We’ll keep treading, keep floating.
It’s not everything,
but it’s something.

Me (30F) met my partner (28 N) six years ago working together at an Italian restaurant. I just broke up with my boyfriend. It was love at first sight. The only problem was he had a girlfriend. He promised right away to break up with her. He saw us every other night for that half year but I wasn’t really happy with it but also in love. 

When they finally broke up she had a lot of suspicion but he never told her the truth. 

We went on a trip to Asia for half a year and after five months he had a accident where a rock wall collapsed on him.

And i stayed with him in Ho chi min for three months till he was declared fit to fly home. Back in the Netherlands he had to live in a full time revlidation center till he was fully recovered. That was the first time we had some relationship problems. His friends did only visit him once and he started to really hang on to me. We talked a lot about this and he slowly started his life up again. 

He felt like he missed out on a part of life and being young and wanted some freedom in the relationship. I was okay with him kissing some girls he would never see again at a festival and sleep with one. No contact after.

We moved into a rental house. Both found good jobs in the city we lived in and bought a house after two years. He told me he needed some freedom and wanted to explore dating a bit. I was also interested but he was sure he could not handle it. I wanted to give him that bit of freedom and some space to explore. He met up with a date for a second time and did not tell me about it. I knew, but he kept denying and making up bad lies. I was completely broken for three days and nights and he didn’t give me anything. 

I told him I also couldn’t handle this anymore. A few weeks later on a drunk night he did admit to it and even had a laugh about it. He also told me that when he finally broke up with that first girlfriend they had sex twice when we were dating. He even spent the night there once. He told me this really lightly and like it was funny. I didn’t feel like picking a fight and let it go. 

We got an official partnership and bought a house together.

About four months later a new thing started. He is a psychologist and started sharing an office with a new female coworker that had the same potition as him. At first he only had bad things to say about her, she annoyed him with her adhd, was unattractive and would tell stupid stories that interrupted him while trying to do his job.

After about three weeks they started texting very very often. He would text with her in bed, smiling at his phone sent instagram reels non stop. I asked him if they suddenly because friends but it was nothing. Just some fun coworker talk. Not letting me see the messages. 

I took his laptop and read the messages. There were some things that i found quite strange, meeting up at toilets at work, jokingly asking her to suck his dick, messages like “let’s go secretly out for drinks when our partners are not home”.

I told him it made me feel bad and like his attention was very focused on her. They started to have drinks after work and go bouldering together. Told me I had nothing to worry about. Suggested I maybe get therapy for being so suspicious. 

He says he would make comments like that to everyone. I know that is not true haha. He still denies that it was flirting or he could have noticed something was going on between them. All stupid jokes. 

We had many talks about it. One night after bouldering and drinks he came home and told me: we have feelings for each other and just realized. She is also in a relationship living together with her boyfriend (28M) for two years. He admitted he had been flirting but he didn’t realize. Nothing happend

He promised me to have no contact after work anymore because I wasn’t comfortable. They go out for lunch and coffee everyday already so I guess that is enough time to chat. He thinks that that is unfair and I should just trust him. 

What do you think about this? 
Can relationship therapy make this better? Is this just the way he is and if I don’t like it I should just divorce?

I've never used a manual machine, I just kinda eyeballed the espresso shot and shut it off when it looked like enough. Good crema. I thought I did a terrible job steaming the milk, the wand was in the middle of the cup till the end and I thought I shut it off early as I was scared it might be slow to shut off. The latte tasted great if imperfect anyways. I think I can rule out milk steaming as the issue, my halfassed milk steaming was good enough.

I last night I learned about the 2:1 ratio and that bambinos are known to be inconsistent in their volume(mine certainly is), using a scale is suggested.

I used a scale today, my single walled, double shot stock portafilter supposedly can hold 18g, but the scale only measured 11g. I double checked the accuracy of the scale against items of known weight, it's accurate +/- 1g. I'm curious if this looks like the grind is too large? It seems a bit inconsistent. My grinder is a $50 Mr. Coffee Burr grinder set to the finest espresso grind(model no. BVMC-BMH23-RB-1)

Here's the shot that this produced:

A fourth attempt with more effort towards making sure the grounds were evenly distributed before tamping yielded 15g and I was more careful to pull the cup out after \~30g espresso. I didn't take a picture of the espresso, but the puck was more dense than the previous watery ones and had the imprint of the machine on it. It's on top:

I now suspect the real issue is that I'm using too little grinds and perhaps the grinds aren't fine enough or evenly ground. Does that sound right to you? Would I be better served investing into a better grinder or rather finding a portafilter/basket that will let me fit closer to 20g+ in it?",2,1737502238.0,espresso,7,0.75,False

Me (30F) met my partner (28 N) six years ago working together at an Italian restaurant. I just broke up with my boyfriend. It was love at first sight. The only problem was he had a girlfriend. He promised right away to break up with her. He saw us every other night for that half year but I wasn’t really happy with it but also in love. 

When they finally broke up she had a lot of suspicion but he never told her the truth. 

We went on a trip to Asia for half a year and after five months he had a accident where a rock wall collapsed on him.

And i stayed with him in Ho chi min for three months till he was declared fit to fly home. Back in the Netherlands he had to live in a full time revlidation center till he was fully recovered. That was the first time we had some relationship problems. His friends did only visit him once and he started to really hang on to me. We talked a lot about this and he slowly started his life up again. 

He felt like he missed out on a part of life and being young and wanted some freedom in the relationship. I was okay with him kissing some girls he would never see again at a festival and sleep with one. No contact after.

We moved into a rental house. Both found good jobs in the city we lived in and bought a house after two years. He told me he needed some freedom and wanted to explore dating a bit. I was also interested but he was sure he could not handle it. I wanted to give him that bit of freedom and some space to explore. He met up with a date for a second time and did not tell me about it. I knew, but he kept denying and making up bad lies. I was completely broken for three days and nights and he didn’t give me anything. 

I told him I also couldn’t handle this anymore. A few weeks later on a drunk night he did admit to it and even had a laugh about it. He also told me that when he finally broke up with that first girlfriend they had sex twice when we were dating. He even spent the night there once. He told me this really lightly and like it was funny. I didn’t feel like picking a fight and let it go. 

We got an official partnership and bought a house together.

About four months later a new thing started. He is a psychologist and started sharing an office with a new female coworker that had the same potition as him. At first he only had bad things to say about her, she annoyed him with her adhd, was unattractive and would tell stupid stories that interrupted him while trying to do his job.

After about three weeks they started texting very very often. He would text with her in bed, smiling at his phone sent instagram reels non stop. I asked him if they suddenly because friends but it was nothing. Just some fun coworker talk. Not letting me see the messages. 

I took his laptop and read the messages. There were some things that i found quite strange, meeting up at toilets at work, jokingly asking her to suck his dick, messages like “let’s go secretly out for drinks when our partners are not home”.

I told him it made me feel bad and like his attention was very focused on her. They started to have drinks after work and go bouldering together. Told me I had nothing to worry about. Suggested I maybe get therapy for being so suspicious. 

He says he would make comments like that to everyone. I know that is not true haha. He still denies that it was flirting or he could have noticed something was going on between them. All stupid jokes. 

We had many talks about it. One night after bouldering and drinks he came home and told me: we have feelings for each other and just realized. She is also in a relationship living together with her boyfriend (28M) for two years. He admitted he had been flirting but he didn’t realize. Nothing happend

I took his laptop and read the messages. There were some things that i found quite strange, meeting up at toilets at work, jokingly asking her to suck his dick, messages like “let’s go secretly out for drinks when our partners are not home”.

He says he would make comments like that to everyone. I know that is not true haha. He still denies that it was flirting or he could have noticed something was going on between them. All stupid jokes. 

He promised me to have no contact after work anymore because I wasn’t comfortable. They go out for lunch and coffee everyday already so I guess that is enough time to chat. He thinks that that is unfair and I should just trust him. 

What do you think about this? 
Can relationship therapy make this better? Is this just the way he is and if I don’t like it I should just divorce?

1i6wprr,https://www.reddit.com/r/soloboardgaming/comments/1i6wprr/looking_for_recommendations_of_12_player_games/,Looking for recommendations of 1-2+ player games with relatively small table footprint.,"After work, I usually like to bring out Sagrada or Azul mini to play their solo modes on my computer desk. The space they take up is not particularly large and they set up pretty quickly. Would like to request the community for suggestions for solo boardgame suggestions that don't take up too large of a space on a desk (the space I can make easily accessible for me on my desk would be 17x17 inches, with a little wiggle room) but also have the option to play 2 or more players (sometimes play with family members and kids on the bigger 24x33 inches coffee table!)

**Games that I've played solo:**

Sagrada - I play the base solo variant and have been told it's really bad and brutal, but I so far I've enjoyed the challenge. Placing dice feels nice and tactile and the math/spatial puzzle is fun.

Azul mini - Simpler spatial puzzle using boxofdelights solo rules. Again, same nice and tactile feeling of holding and placing tiles and clicking them in position in the mini board.

Horrified - A really fun solo game that I wish I could play on my desk. It's too big so it doesnt fit my desk, but is a blast whenever I do play it on the coffee table, solo or with family members. Probably the only immersive feeling boardgame I have. I find the enemy is pretty much just an automata controlled by cards.

Carcassone - Tried the official solo variant, but the map tends to get too big so it's not very feasible on my desk.

Tiny epic tactics - I have been finding myself playing this less often for solo mode. Lots of things to memorize from the rule book,  but more concerningly for me, I struggle with the lightweight tokens used to track stats (hp/mana/arrows) on the character cards: an accidental nudge on the setup and they just slide around. I may have messed up my game's setup more than once due to this.

**Games that I'm currently considering picking up:**

Beacon patrol - Feels like a more fleshed out version of Carcassone solo variant, but I worry the map just naturally expands beyond the borders of my desk.

Flower Fields - Want to give polyomino games a try, and this one seems to have the smallest footprint with an official solo mode.

New York Zoo - The first polyomino game I was considering. I like the idea that the goal is to fully cover your board, but 2 major concerns: The elephant board doesn't fit my desk, and from reading past threads, the solo mode leaves so much to be desired.

Tiny towns - Haven't actually looked to much into this other than it's frequently suggested in youtube.

Forbidden desert - Looks like the same fun of Horrified with added exploration, but worried the space might not be enough even if the board is modular.

**Games I don't really want to look into:**

Roll and write - as small as the footprint of these games are, I don't really want to be writing more after work.",4,1737502196.0,soloboardgaming,2,0.83,False

We were not happy. I was in an abusive pattern. My kids were suffering, my grandmother; (who lived with us RIP), was suffering also. She was DV survivor back in the ‘50s.  

I had been disconnected sentimentally for years, cause we did broke up before back in 2018. I had to call the cops. I have always worked. But I needed child support for what was necessary for the kids. He denied the help cause he thought I was gonna bring a new man in the house. He even violated the Protection Order placed, by entering the parking lot where we used to live and sleeping in the truck during those first days. We had only one car, so he took it. I had to take the kids to school in taxi or walking. He kept on not wanting to help with the part he had to. So bad, that we didn’t have real numbers for the payment contract without him in it. He did not want to be out of the contract. So, the lawyer could never established a real number of rent without him on the contract. He never took care of his finances, so I didn’t had exact amount for what he was making, he never did his taxes (I always did my taxes) and was always upset that I could have money on February. The numbers, including him on the contract and an estimate of what he was doing per year, gave about $585 a month. BUT, again, with him still in the contract of the apartment. He even went and talked to the Administrator of the towers. She talk us through and after three months of sleeping alone, I gave up and let him come back. Now, last year, he got real sick, he was at the hospital and as normal, I was taking care of everything. 

Mind you, he works alone and by his own hours. I don’t see money. I am broke two days after getting my check.

So, my situation now it’s a little bit similar. He was out if the hospital and the house was a little messy, I was still getting his clothes clean and getting the rest folded. Well, I was tired so I went to bed. That night, last March, he became so mad and disgusted with me, cause he believed I was the one making him sick. He asked for a divorce and wrote a long and nasty message, including a part for our 17yr old daughter, who saw in him a hero. Well, in the morning the car would not start, he already had thrown everything out of the closets, yelled, screamed and insulted me in every possible way. My grandma was listening at all this. He laughed when the van did not started.  (Mind you again, the van was his, but I was investing on it, just changed the key switch and paid someone with my money. Also tires, carwash, oil and filter; etc. …) so he starts the conversation about wanting a divorce, that I should take the issue very seriously if I wanted to stay with him. So I answered :”Pete… (we gonna call him Pete) you can leave. Seriously, I cannot stand you anymore… you wanna leave? Just take your things and leave. Leave. Just leave…” 

He was a mess. Started yelling again, shook the fridge and because he was still so weak from the hospital, the fridge was gonna fall on him. He threw several coffee cups, yelled a little more and left. I changed the padlocks that same day. He took the car and left me, again, without transportation. 

It has been a little rollercoaster. But I am happy alone in my bed. 

Him, after insinuated himself to me several times, found someone. Well, Pete had sex on the bed where my daughter sleeps when she stays there. She is upset. She found an opened condom package while she was cleaning her space. She went and showed it to him and instead of apologizing for using her bed to have sex with a stranger, he stared yelling at her for not respecting his manhood and privacy. Thing is that, while Pete and his new person were having sex on my daughter’s space, he left her son sleeping on his bed; the same room and bed where my son with him sleeps when he stays there.

For what we know, is a young woman with two small kids, two different dads. 

My daughter feels sad and aggravated because he is changing with her. He yells at her the same way he had yell at me. He yells at our son the same way he yelled at me. He also treats his mom like a punching bag. I don’t want anything to do with him. But, he has not had the decency of telling me about this situation. I believe if you are starting or started a relationship, you should talk to your ex. 

My daughter is not going back to her father’s house. She has decided this by her own. But I would like to speak to him about this disrespectful act towards my daughter’s space and the fact that our son is autistic and he has started a relationship with a woman with TWO kids, from TWO dads.

1i6wfu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1i6wfu9/workplace_advice_difficuilty_in_keeping_working/,Workplace advice - difficuilty in keeping working in large office.,"I am now working 3 days a week on site in a large office. Not a full office and indeed it can look over half empty, In fact it is over half empty so itr is not noisy or anything, TBH whilst I do get distracted by peoople moving around in the office I do not have an issue with actually being in the office.

What I do have an issue with is actually working. So I mean I can do fits and bursts of activity. I just cannot do the same sit at your desk and hardly move thing everyone else does. How do I handle this? At the moment I am drinking a lot and going to the toilet to take a break or I get up and walk outside to get a bit of fresh air. I think I cannot do this more than so many times every day. Sometimes I last over and hour and others I am struggling after 15 minutes.

The other issue is that I am also the type to fall asleep at certain times of the day if not stimulated. So usually an hour after lunch I get drowsy. However today I had that from about 9am!! I start at 7am and finish at 15:15. So with lunch half hour being about 12 or 12:30 I have 5 to 5.5 hours of morning work stuck at my desk to cope with. Then at 12::30 or 13:00 I have 2.25 to 2.75 hours in the afternoon. I reckon that if I get through to 14:00 or so then I feel I am home and dry coping. I am starting to think about packing up at 15:00 so the last 15 minutes goes very quickly indeed.

So my question is about what is acceptable to cope with needing to step away. At home I go for a coffee or snack or just sit and watch tv or streamed news. I just take that break, even down to taking a 15 minute nap. At work I am on show like everyone else so I have to work and look like I am busy. So sometimes I stare at the screen like I am reeading some document when I am really away with the faeries as someone might have once said in the olden days. Does anyone else get sleeepy despite working? What helps for you to stay awake and working in an open office environment?

I can only think of drinking coffee and when that runs out (two insulated coffee mugs in the morning and one bought in the work canteen put into one of them for the afternoon and a 650ml bottle of water). I also eat plain, redskin peanuts as the chewing action kind of helps I think..

BTW I am undiagnosed (just sent the screening forms off so appointment should be soon) and I am not open at work with myh suspicions. I will let them know after I get it if it is positive for ADHD or something (highly likely). So it is not like I have something that has to be adjusted for by work to cover any action I make that is out of the ordinary for the workplace.

So any advice?",2,1737501453.0,ADHDUK,0,1.0,False

The Nine genuinely has the best location out of any other student housing options. It's a 5 minute drive and through nice back roads to UCF. 

The building was built just a couple of years ago so all the appliances are just about brand new.

The room I'm subleasing is the biggest in the unit and the only one to feature a WALK-IN closet. I've noted this again below the floorplan photo.

Out of the SIX bedrooms in the floorplan, ONLY THREE ARE OCCUPIED (Including mine.) The roommates I have there now are brothers. Great guys and easy to get along with. They don't drink or smoke in the apartment and tend to pick up after themselves. There is a cat, so keep that in mind in case you have any allergies (She doesn't shed much.) 

Parking is included (Garage parking.) The nine currently has run out of available parking spots so this is valuable! 

The gym is decent and the clubhouse has a coffee bar that I always go to and they've also got a nice pool.

Valet trash comes around Sunday - Thursday so you don't have to worry about a trip to the trash chute.

Please let me know if you are interested and/or have any questions!!

Rent: $1,059

Utilities (Water included in rent): $20 - $30

Parking fee: $60

Valet trash removal fee: $8

\+ If you resign for next year for the same unit (meaning you won't have to move out of your room and the transition between the contracts is seamless), then the rate goes down to $1,019, and I believe they are lowering parking as well. This could be subject to change.

1i6wbn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6wbn2/tldr_i_f30_have_a_really_good_friend_m31_but_his/,"TLDR: I (F30) have a really good friend (M31), but his girlfriend feels uncomfortable with our friendship, looking for some advice on how to move forward.","Throw away account, names have been changed...

My friend Chris and I have been close since elementary school as our parents are best friends, older siblings are best friends, grandparents are friends… you get the picture. There has never been anything romantic between us, we have never had feelings for each other beyond platonic family friends, we essentially grew up together and spent most holidays together, family vacations together ect., I view him more like a cousin than anything. I have a boyfriend who I am deeply in love with, live with and have been with for 6 years. My boyfriend and Chris get along great and there has never been any tension. I also understand the stereotypes around guys with “girl BFFs” and always make an effort to never be THAT kind of “girl-friend”, make an effort to get to know Chris’s girlfriends, make it VERY obvious I love my boyfriend, try to give his girlfriends more attention than him if we are hanging out/ meeting and all around want to make it super clear I am not a threat at all. Chris and I hang out maybe once or twice a month, usually with my boyfriend as well, and it’s usually something casual like grabbing a drink after work, meeting up for coffee or a short hike.

Chris has had a pretty crappy dating record, that is until now. He is finally with a woman who seems like she really has her life together, very smart, beautiful, good job, funny and from everything Chris has told me, just absolutely great and healthy relationship all around. Chris is super happy and I am so so happy for him. My boyfriend and I host thanksgiving at our house, it’s usually my boyfriend’s family, my family, Chris and his family and 3-4 close friends who are single/ families are far so they have essential been adopted into our extended family. Chris and our friends usually spend the night after dinner so it also turns into a small, casual party once the parents leave. This year Chris brought his girlfriend, Amber. The day seemed to be going great, we chatted, got to know each other more, were cracking jokes, drinking, I thought the night was completely fine and I genuinely really like her. I even mentioned to her how I have seen Chris with not so great partners and that I am really happy that he met her and that I really like how clearly happy she makes him. At one point she brought up how close our families are and asked if we always do thanksgiving together. I told her yes, we have done thanksgivings and a lot of holidays together for about as far back as I can even remember. She asked more questions like how long we’ve known each other, what other holidays our families spend together ect., which I did tell her that our families are very close and did mention how Chris essentially feels like a cousin. Shortly after that she went to bed, I really didn’t think much of it. The next morning Chris and Amber had left before the rest of the house had woken up, which was a bit weird because we usually do a big breakfast before everyone heads home. Again, didn’t think much of it and thought maybe they just wanted to spend the day off together. I messaged both of them to say thanks for coming and told Amber it was great to meet her and that I hope we can all do a double date sometime soon.

Fast forward to the night after Thanksgiving, I get a call from Chris, he said that Amber was really uncomfortable and said that I had made her feel like I was rubbing our friendship in her face and thought it was weird that our families would spend so much time together because we aren’t related. She thinks it’s odd to spend holidays with anyone outside extended family and it makes her uncomfortable that we seem to see each other most major holidays, that it’s disrespectful to her for him to include another woman other than her in his holiday plans (unless they were related to him). I told him I was really sorry if I caused any tension and that I am  happy to talk to her and apologize that I made her feel uncomfortable and that I understand our families are close and recognize most people do spend time with immediate or extended family so can understand from an outside perspective that us being this close may seem weird and that I didn’t mean to seem like I was rubbing our friendship in her face, from my perspective I just answered her questions, I hadn’t gone into any detail of our friendship or our families friendships that weren’t unprompted but regardless, I didn’t intend to make her feel bad and wanted to apologize to her. He also told me that she has asked that he doesn’t see me for the foreseeable future. I did tell him I am happy to back off and not hang out with him until she feels more comfortable, but did bring up Christmas and NYE being right around the corner and it might be awkward to find excuses for one of us to not be around but I am willing to try to work something out that would work for them, my boyfriend and our families. Chris sounded really upset, and I felt awful that I might have given the wrong impression to Amber. He also mentioned he hadn’t told Amber how close our two families are because he didn’t think much about it or that it would be a big deal, so we think in Ambers head this was a one-off event that we just happened to plan together, not that this was a tradition or that we see each other and each others families on most holidays so could have been caught off guard.

I messaged Amber, this is what I sent her “Hey I had a really good time with you last night and am really glad you came, but most importantly I am hoping to clear the air. I am really sorry I made you feel uncomfortable that was not my intention at all. If you are open to a conversation I would like an opportunity to apologize and hope we can put any misunderstandings behind us”.

Amber replied “Well you did and I’d appreciate it if you don’t contact Chris or invite him to things that should be for family and significant others and honestly I feel uncomfortable with you hanging out with him at all at this point”

Me “I am sorry you are uncomfortable, I hope you can understand he was invited with his family because it’s more about our families traditions than it is to have time with Chris, I have no intentions of disrespecting you or your relationship and have no problems taking a step back, I do hope you would be open to getting to know me and Dan better and am willing to take it at your pace”  
(for context Dan is my boyfriend).

Amber “You don’t think it’s weird to invite someone else’s boyfriend to family holidays especially when you already have a man??”

Me “Our families are really good friends with each other, I promise you that’s all there is to it, Dan and Chris get along really well too, if you take some time and give us a chance I hope you can see that”

Amber “Pick me energy”

At this point I didn’t continue the conversation but sent a message to Chris saying I am open if she ever wants to talk this out but for now let’s keep low to no contact unless its to coordinate who will be where when our families get together and wished him luck in his relationship, reiterated that I don’t want to get in between them or cause issues in his relationship but that I reached out to apologize and don’t think her and I will see eye to eye at the moment.   

Over Christmas and NYE we were able to avoid being at the same gatherings and avoided seeing each other and so far I have only received one text from Chris outside of coordinating holiday plans, he messaged Dan and I in a group message essentially saying he misses us and hopes this will blow over. Dan “liked” the message, I just left it on read.

It’s been about 2 months since I’ve had any real contact or conversation with him, I am sad that it looks like I might be loosing a friend. I am also stressed on how we are going to navigate any family gatherings moving forward. It has already been a little awkward because my family has asked about Chris and I have kept playing it off like we haven’t had time to hang out, I know I can’t tell my family or it will get back to his and that could open an whole new can of worms. I am hurt because Chris and I would talk pretty often and I do miss him, but I don’t want to hurt a relationship with someone who outside of what feels like some jealousy or insecurity issues I do genuinely think is a good person for Chris. And I guess selfishly, I am hurt that Chris didn’t set Amber straight that this is a purely platonic friendship and that we are kind of stuck in each others lives due to our families being so close. I did have an ex who was a pretty jealous guy and I told him from the beginning that Chris was a good friend, nothing more, and that if that wasn’t ok with him then we weren’t going to work out, I know every relationship is different but that does bother me. Dan thinks I should try to reach out, but he’s also pissed at Amber and thinks based on how she reacted that she isn’t good for Chris, but I am trying to give her some grace, we don’t know her background or if she has had relationships in the past that have left her with more of a guard up when it comes to her significant others having friends who are women.

I guess I am just not sure if it’s worth reaching out to Amber to rectify this, would it be disrespectful to tell Chris how I am feeling or do I just continue on not saying anything to either of them? Is what I said overstepping? Should I have handled this differently? Just need some advice on what is the best next step, if any, and if I could have worded things better Thanksgiving night.",2,1737501147.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Is my unease valid or a side-effect of my mental ilness? What can i do to make the two of us happier?,"TLDR - This is my(F19) First real relationship. On paper my boyfriend(25M) is everything i could want but in reality i feel ""forced"" to love him even if I sacrifice my own comfort. To what extend are my feelings normal if they are normal at all? I don't feel like an Aro/Ace.

Not sure how to start the context segment so I will just dive straight in. I feel like I should see a therapist but I live in a country where it took me 4 months just to get an appointment with the one I used to see reguraly and I am unsure of where to turn for unbiased opinions and advice.

Also English is not my first language and I am still working on my grammar. So I apologize for any mistakes down bellow or above.

This is my (19F) First relationship ever. To some i may be a late bloomer but past trauma , serious mental health issues and just plain circumstance (When I started highschool Covid happened and I also went to an art oriented school with mostly girls or boys not interested in girls... Great for making friends tho.)  
For a moment i believed I was Ace, but honestly I never related to Ace stories and I do have fantasies, ""impure thougths"" past crushes (even if just 2) and ""Hear me out"" moments. I honestly just feel like i have intimacy anxiety, and heavy body image and trust issues. So yeah, I don't want to make people feel sorry for me but being afraid of intimacy is usually a dealbreaker in relationships and these struggles of mine could explain this uncommon fear.

Enter BF(M25). On paper he is everything I could ever want it is not even funny. One of my friends even made a joke that if she didn't know he was real she'd just assume that he was one of the characters for one of my projects even if she knew just the very surface stuff.. A nerdy dude who loves books and video-games. Barely ever drinks. Has enough ego and spine for the both of us. I adore his facial features... BF even has some of that ""Dark Tragic backstory"". From what he described it was because he refused to value anything which resulted in alot of bad and reckless behaviour but he ended up changing due to family. He did a nearly total 180 while still learning from those parts of his life.  
The ""backstory trope"" is not the only thing that makes me reffer to him as movie-like, as in many regards we are the exact opposites (I am a meek 120lbs spineless alt girl with confidence issues and need for familiarity and routine and he is a strong extrovert oozing confidence and knowlege just wanting to yap and forsake routines). He took me on the most wonderful dates (arboretum, Arcade, a bad 80s film in the back of his car... that one was my favorite) and he even brought me an enormus bear plush,... even bigger than the kind you see in romcoms.  
Me and my BF met at a local metal show back in august.. He even said that when he first saw me he had to get my social media or he won't leave and he did get my instagram in the end. We mostly exchanged DMs at first, but after we went on a concert with some of my friends he started to drive into my town and we grew closer.

This is sorta  where my first gripes with him began... We hung out a couple of times, nearly every time it was just friendly. After about 11 days of hanging nearly every second day (Going on walks, drinking coffee and cinema) we had a bit of a deep talk and I confessed that I thought that I had a crush on him... I felt nervous but not the good kind. I had a hunch that he liked me since we first met but I honestly physically struggled to get the confession out. Then he tried to kiss me but I felt stressed out and honestly did not even know how to proceed in a kiss. The atempt was then repeated multiple times which resulted in me trying to laugh each one off.  
After a day of thinking I decided that the kiss made me feel the same way as when I held a hand of one of my male friends after he begged me to do that when i rejected him, even tho BF was everything i could ever want and the friend was not (heavy music and age was the only real thing we had in common but this is not about the friend.)  
... So I said everything on my mind, that I don't feel ready to commit, that romantic intimacy fuels me with fear and that i probably miscalculated my feelings due to this whole thing seeming so unfamiliar and probably see him as a friend still despite the surface attraction. I said that I am not ready for a relationship now but maybe down the line something could happen but I still need alot of time healing and he should move on since it is not worth the wait.  
So I basically friendzoned him... then he bought cigarettes and a lighter with money he had to borrow from me, drove like a maniac before dropping me off, later he told me that he even drove under the influence and drove the card into a field on his way home. That evening he said that he fell in love with me via DMs. While this was happening on his side i was distressed from the way he took it and felt bad that I hung out with him for that long only seeing him as a friend while he hoped for more (when I wrote it down it is obvious and i kinda feel stupid for not being sure in my assumptions sooner). I cried about it to my dad, whom convinced me to give BF a shot, since I never had a boy understand me to the degree that BF has...

Sooo... we got together. Now it is over 2 months officialy. Both of us stressed out over exams... and honestly I feel like I would be happier out of this relationship. This guy is head over heels and i feel awful for not being able to return his affections or efforts. I keep analyzing my own feelings and hope that I will fall as hard too... but honestly, i feel like my feelings for him just get worse. Due to him being the more logical and rational one I feel like my emotions are underminded and misunderstood, which breeds resentment on my part.

Because we are both stressed I tried to approach my concerns lightly, that I don't feel emotionally fufilled, seen or comfortable in many ways and tried to lay out exactly why and what are my gripes. He however didn't waste a second blaming it on his background or nature imediatly saying that he would be just roleplaying being changed and he doesn't like roleplay. He said that he will never be in my head... But if the task is as impossible as he makes it seem, how do I appreciate the things he is offering already and draw more fufilment from them. He respects and understands me which is something not many people do. He has these bad moments but he is honestly the sweetest dude ever and I wanna make him feel appreciated and more comfortable in this relationship since he fought hard to get it. He has alot of baggage and so do I but right now I just feel so incredibly conflicted. I don't wanna hurt him even more espetially now that he has exams,... but I just feel like the misfit in my own relationship.  
I do plan to bring up more of my emotional needs after both our heads are cleared of school and most of the stress it caused. Since I do believe that my negative mood, lack of sleep and propper nutrition is also a factor in my lack of fufillment.

I don't feel suuuper thrilled about being all that physical (I don't think I mind being foldled or made out with but I also don't feel like I enjoy it all that much either) but I loved cuddling with him and we even slept in the same bed while watching movies more than once. He even gave me a ""how to kiss"" basics haha...  
What scares me the most is that I do not remember that time he tried undressing me... I was honestly shocked when we were joking around about me being a prude and he said that he already saw me topless, I honestly didn't believe when he said he did, but he seemed serious and somewhat gobsmacked that I didn't remember... Could throwing away this memory be a result of my former experience as a kid?  
He also tried to squeeze my neck while kissing once, but when I flinched he imediatly stopped to check if I am okay. I do think that him saying that I am not a real goth after was weird, but he corrected himself by saying that I am ""The Cure"" Trad goth and not the typical goth girl?... is it odd that this statement makes me feel iffy?

Once again I am sorry for all the questions but I am just so confused. I just need to see my situation in another light... you can probably tell that I am desperate just because I am turning to internet strangers with such personal matters...

This is everything I could think of properly rn. If there are any questions I'll try to answer them as best as I can without revealing too much since I feel like I said alot already.

1i6w7c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1i6w7c2/14_weeks_recap/,14 weeks recap,"My last binge was 14 weeks ago.

For me and my goals, bingeing involved wheat products or candy. If I cut out wheat, that eliminates 95% of my binge foods.

I practice volume eating, meaning I can eat six eggs for breakfast, and it doesn’t count as a binge to me because it doesn’t disrupt my blood sugar or make me feel ashamed. Sorry, but two dainty eggs do not fill me up and can lead to a binge later in the day. Now, if I ate an entire loaf of bread in a day, that would count as a binge. I’d feel sluggish, bloated, and tired, which would create a cycle of shame and future bingeing. I have PCOS, which affects my blood sugar.

I eat one meal a day with volume eating and do not follow a three-meal-a-day routine. For example, I ate an entire package of cheese today, but that doesn’t qualify as a binge. The meal I had today (six eggs, chicken, peppers, onion, and cheese) was easily over 1,000 calories, but it constituted my entire intake for the day. Despite this, I am technically underweight, so my volume eating doesn’t concern me.

What I Miss the Most: Crumbl cookies.

My Last Binge (14 Weeks Ago): Whole wheat pasta. It didn’t make me happy. It didn’t taste great. I knew it would mess up my blood sugar, and I was tired of disappointing myself with my diet.

What I Changed: I eat two bananas and drink a coffee before exercise three times a week. Before this, I was strictly low-carb, and the thought of eating a banana frightened me.

I remind myself that everything I want to binge on, I’ve already had before. Cookies? I know what they taste like. Ice cream? I ate it for decades!

Once I started focusing on my gut health, my diet became filled with less processed food. The best thing I added was microgreen protein smoothies (Orgain protein powder, fresh microgreens, cinnamon, dates, water, chia seeds, and coriander powder). Once I started drinking these, the urge to binge died down.

In the beginning, I allowed myself to binge eat whatever I wanted for one day a week, thinking I was doing a carb refuel. In reality, I was just fueling my binge eating disorder and ruining my blood sugar since I was eating junk that day. Now, if I really need carbs, I find healthy sources like bananas, and I no longer do free-for-all days.",0,1737500833.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,0.5,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I brought the kitchen down into what was the breakfast nook with bay windows, and added a window seat with a ton of storage underneath.  The left is a bar/ coffee area, and the right is microwave/ toaster/panini press that is now not sitting out in the main part of the kitchen (and i don't have it over the stove anymore,  which is great!

We added stacking washer/dryer for added pantry space in the laundry room (there's even shelving above the door). Oh, and the big ""pantry"" looking doors next to the microwave? That's the laundry room.  People think it's another cabinet!

And now we have a dining room! We also closed up the back wall of the dining room and then added a pocket door for more wall space/ better flow.

I'm very happy with it! Our contractor was going through something,  and i basically ended up being the project manager (luckily his guys were good) which was exhausting,  and it was 20 weeks start to finish, which was a tragedy (it was functional by week 15 but still).

I think it's going to be bumpy. And honestly, while I would love a solution, maybe I also just need to feel some kind of camaraderie in this experience or social validation that I'm not an awful person or...something.  
  
I have a handful of students who want to keep a relationship with me after graduation, but man - I just *can't* anymore.   
  
(In all honesty, it's going on 12 years now for one and IDK how to make this person go, and that's what prompted this.)  
  
I'm always very nice, approachable, etc. to students, and I've gotten to know them moderately well through their multiple visits to my office hours while they're enrolled, and so over the years it hasn't been uncommon for some want to have coffee or dinner or whatever after they've graduated when they come into town.   
  
If all of them understood the standard rules of conversation making, it would be fine (and the ones that do: great! I'm all in!). But it's clear many of them think I'm genuinely interested in every detail of their lives and what they've been doing for the last x years (including, in one case, the lives of every one of their coworkers and best friends, too). Or, they trauma dump on me about how legitimately awful their lives have been since graduation and all the bad fortune that has befallen them.  
  
Of course, I'm always glad to hear when they're doing well, and I have sympathy for the ones who have struggled.  
  
But I have minimal spare time during the school year (none, really) and when they let me know they're coming into town and want to get together, I've gotten to the point where I lie if it's a weekend (Sorry - I'll be out of town) because I can't fathom giving up 3+ hours on a Saturday to sitting listening to them talk about themselves without coming up for air. When they come by midweek to my office unannounced, I don't have an excuse and I'm stuck. 

I can't be the only one who experiences this.   
(And yes, it's the least of my problems, but it still is a problem that I had to deal with yet again last week.)

Does anyone have any magical things they've said to gently get out of these kinds of interactions, or better yet, gently get rid of these folks altogether? Sure, I could ignore them (and for a few I have and felt tremendous guilt because I know it's so rude), but I'd rather just be kind in some way.

Life gets busy, and it’s easy to lose touch with the things that really matter, like having someone to talk to, laugh with, and just share the little things in life.

I’m 32, Latino based in SoCal, and looking to meet someone who’s down to build something real—whether that’s just a solid friendship or something more over time. If you’re local, I’d love to grab some food or coffee and see where things go. If not, I’m always up for good conversations and getting to know someone, no pressure.

A little about me: I’m into music, anime, reading, and staying active. I dabble in guitar and was in a punk band back in the day. Also, I’ve got four dogs who keep me on my toes.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out. Let’s see if we vibe.

I am wondering if a product like this exists, and would appreciate if anyone has any ideas!

I am envisioning a product like the Stanley or Thermos food jars that can keep food hot, but where the thick  vacuum lid can be removed and replaced with a travel-mug-style lid for sipping the hot contents (provided it is something thin, like coffee or soup). 

Ideally something easy to clean, so that said transition from coffee to soup could happen easily. 

To anyone's knowledge, does such a thing exist?",1,1737500240.0,thermos,1,1.0,False

My question for y’all is how is the best way to help advertise without seeming like a salesman? I know of psychology today (probably activating that again tonight) but is it weird to have a flyer and post in communal places like coffee shops or town hall (with permission of course from all parties)?

My practice has given me some comfort that they are going to try and focus filling my caseload needs but would be remiss not asking the mass here if they knew better methods.

I realized my date was a little bigger than I was expecting, on top of being very short, and within five seconds I immediately wrote her off as someone I could be sexually attracted to. We had coffee and talked for a couple hours. There was a lot that we covered, but again, I pretty much knew this could only be platonic. Later that night I texted her to let her know that it was great spending time with her, but I’m no longer interested in pursuing anything more.

Another time I was chatting with someone else who was interested in a hookup. She said she was interested, but she’d have to see my dick first. I sent her a pic and she said she was interested and then sent me a nude pic of herself (not everything though). I didn’t find her attractive because she had stomach rolls, saggy boobs, and a flat ass. I gently let her down and told her I was no longer interested in a hookup because of my inexperience. I didn’t feel too bad for that one because she would’ve rejected me if my dick wasn’t on par with whatever her standards were.

Anyways, I look at too much Reddit porn and even one of the “normal nudes” subreddits where I’ll see some bodies on there that will instantly turn me on and I feel like if I don’t get that feeling from someone in real life, I just won’t be sexually attracted to them ever because I’ll mentally write them off. I know my choices are probably limited because I’m not attractive enough to date someone with a body I find attractive, so I almost take comfort in the fact that I know why I’m a virgin, and I’m a terrible person for having these superficial standards.",1,1737500002.0,virgin,7,0.56,False

I want to share my story, experience with this in the hopes that I can help provide someone with the relief that this IS NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD and this too has been the worst time of my life. This is a long read so my apologies, but it 100% feels better to talk about it and know that I'm not crazy. Unfortunately, this is something my older sibling has and is still going through too, but I never had any kind of reaction around him, and I didn't realize the effect this had on him and his life until it started happening to me. 

I'm 27, female, student in a program that involves clinical settings, and currently an active worker in healthcare too. I also smoke tobacco products. I eat a regular diet I guess, but definitely don't eat veggies and greens as I should, and I definitely don't drink enough water. Coffee has my heart. None of these have changed when I started noticing symptoms of PATM. 

 Everything started, when I felt like I was coming to classes smelling like smoke even as I began to isolate my uniforms and school/work bags from the smoking environment. While at work, I'm mostly out and don't have to worry as much about smoke smell and would reapply a perfume and it was fine, nobody cared, nobody had reactions to me.To combat it in my school environment, I thought to myself, why not put car fresheners in my bags, in my jackets, and in my car. Started to use plug in fresheners around my home to keep it smelling fresh and use febreeze on my fabrics. Did this for a few months, no problems. I became more conscious and no longer smelled like smoke in class, and tried out a new perfume i bought and some air framers that i bought in bulk to put in my bags because they were working so well for me. I come in and i started to notice my teacher get red in the face, start sniffling, grabbing his throat and nose, barely able too get through the class, and i thought to myself ""OH NO! Is my new perfume causing him and a few others to have a reaction?"" And this was the beginning of it all. I switched perfumes to what I've been using the entire year that didn't cause any reaction in others what so ever, and even still the reactions were there. So i thought, oh is it the car fresheners i bought? Removed them from my stuff, tried to remove their smell from my clothes that you would think can be easily removed with a simple wash. Didn't do the job, people are still having reactions. The particles from those car fresheners might still be in my clothes, so next up was a good wash method assuming that whatever people were reacting to was on my clothes now. I machine washed, hand washed, changed detergents, used dawn, Apple cider vinegar, regular vinegar, baking soda, dry cleaners, put dryer sheets in pockets, soak for an hour, soak for 24 hours, all done in different combinations, but still nothing worked. So next, i thought, it's the plug in fragrances in my home, maybe they're releasing chemicals that are clinging to me. Unplugged them and took them out of the equation. Still, the same reactions from people. At that point, the only common denominator was myself and my skin. My hygiene has never been an issue, and neither has my bo. I wash, scrub, exfoliate hot areas anytime i shower, and I'm not an excessive sweater. I started to think, well I am approaching 30 and I have been under a lot of stress, are my hormones changing? Am I getting stinky and not realizing it? With the same body wash brand I've been using without issue, i started to scrub longer to try to remove any lingering bacteria that maybe I'm not removing. No change to reactions. I buy new deordorants, old spice, as I was using degree. I tried spray on deodorant from secret. I tried gold bond powder, gold bond powder spray. And no change. I tried switching over to hibiclens as its recommended for body odor and bacteria removal. No change. I switched soaps to dr. Squash, dr. Bronners, and people still have reactions around me. I've tried chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid, aha scrub, salicylic acid. Still no change. I even went without using any hair products after washing and deep conditioning my hair under the impression that it could be coming from my hair dye. But I've rinsed, shampooed, clarified, and conditioned my hair with no change to reactions. I went to a dermatologist who prescribed me 1% clindamycin pads to use on areas that are trouble for body odor and have been using them for 3 days now and the reactions from people have not decreased. I've even attempted to reduce the amount of nicotine being introduced into my body, and it still has had no effect on people's reactions around me. 

I've asked so many people around me, even the people who are actively having a reaction, what's the smell that's making you react that way? I think it might be me. And they will say no its not you, you don't stink, as they actively plug their nose the next minute. But then there's the few times i can get details about the odor or chemical scent from people, where they've said it smells like onions in here, or it smells really bad over here. But hearing that, was very confusing to me because of the way I have been washing since this has been happening, how can it actually be me that smells like that? Some people genuinely do not smell us and don't react to us, which is lovely. But I've also noticed that it is not a release from our body that is constant. It comes and goes in waves, and I've only been able to pick up on this because I'm watching the people who have reactions and I see the redness in the face come, go away and then return. They're are starting to do more research on it now, but it seems we are releasing volatile organic compounds. The questions that have yet to be officially answered, is what causes this, how do we reduce our stop it, and must we really completely change our diets and lifestyles?

I forgot to mention, there's also been instances where I've smelled something in the air around me that was spicy, cumin like, almost like pepper spray, and I've had at least patient mention my nose feels spicy but thats it. And she in fact was not experiencing that until i came around because her nose wasn't red. Because of that, research lead me to think i have corynebacterium on my skin, which is what i told the dermatologist who prescribed the clindamycin. I'm going to continue to use it, but you would think there'd be less of a reaction from people if that was the case. I still think this could be bacteria on my skin, but the way been cleansing, I'm becoming less convinced. Especially when hibiclens, glycolic acid, aha scrub, salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar, alcohol, meant to prevent bacterial growth is not stopping the reactions.",1,1737499838.0,PATM_Support,1,1.0,False
