1h93jlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1h93jlx/a_grown_man_who_is_afraid_of_the_light/,A grown man who is afraid of the light,"I sat down on the small table in the gas station coffee shop and began to observe the old man in front of me. This was the fourth time I saw him here. Different tables, different times of the day, but unmistakably the same man.

It was odd that I took interest in him, I knew that restaurants, bars and coffeeshops have regulars, I am one for a few such establishments myself. This man in particular caught my attention for some reason though. Perhaps it was because  the man who spends entire days drinking coffee alone was always quite a fascinating character to me. A philosopher, observing the world, without participating in it much. In a sense he was quite like me, only difference lying in his age and wealth which allowed him to spend his whole day sitting on that table.

A few other men greeted him, but didn’t stop to talk. The man himself had a certain elegance in him, though not in a traditional way. He did not look like a man who lived in comfort for most of his life. His clothes were not cheap and he had a particular sense of style. For a moment I thought he looked like a native American for some odd reason, though that would make his regular presence in this particular gas station of a central European town even more intriguing. Intriguing being an odd word since I am the only one intrigued by him as far as I knew.

I took a sip of my coffee. It was too late for one, but I did not have any urgent work in the morning. The man did the same. He can’t be older than 70, maybe even younger, I thought. It struck me that my behaviour was odd, although observing people in public was a right nobody thought to rob me of. In fact I often wish and hope somebody would observe me.

That is also odd. Logically one would want the opposite. There is safety in anonymity, but also loneliness. As a child I often had this constant fear that others were reading my thoughts, which overtime turned into a wish. I constantly wished that those around me would know what I wanted them to know without me needing the courage to say it. That my peers would know how funny I am, my teachers how smart I am and the  girls listened to me – how much joy every piece of their attention brought me. When my delusions came closer to reality, I assumed most around me to be gifted with a genius like intelligence which would allow them to read my subtle behaviour and understand my psychology by themselves. Of course neither were most people that smart, nor am I that interesting and attention worthy.

I do believe myself to be fairly clever and I could theoretically hold a conversation on quite a few topics, if I ever knew how to start one. I always feared others would think I am strange or God forbid enjoying their company.  Which is why I wore the mask of slightly contemptuous and unpleasant lad, since I find it far less pathetic.

I took another sip of coffee. The old man was looking at the crime drama playing on the TV. He was the only one giving it any attention. Another man was putting his tray a way and exchanged a few words with the young cashier, before looking at me for a few moments. My desire to be observed could be misleading me, I thought, but he held his eyes, before smiling faintly. Could he know what I was doing? Not that he had any reason to care. Besides for him to know, he would need to be quite similar to me. Or maybe he was observing me in the same way I was observing the other man. Maybe I wasn’t as unique as I thought.

I never could know. As said, my desire to be observed was often misleading me, but I often caught people looking at me. I’m not sure if I am good looking or not, though I believe I am somewhat pretty, which might not be optimal. In any case people often let much of my abnormal behaviour go uncommented and undisturbed. I was far less socially ostracized than classmates who behaved in a very similar manner.

The second man got up to leave and looked at me again for a few seconds before giving me something I thought to be a faint smile. Maybe I was being observed, I thought. A ridiculous notion, I knew, though I wished it were true. Attention starved was quite apt of a term for me, though my behaviour would imply the opposite. A grown man afraid of the light, as Plato would call me.

Attention, attention, attention… I rolled the word around in my head for a few moments. All I wanted was this. Whenever it was given to me for free, an addiction grew towards that person. I rarely think of people as such honestly. My goal is to impress them, catch their attention and receive their admiration. So many people who could have been my friends barely remember I exist, because I am certain to my right to live my life without encountering a negative reaction from anybody.

The old man looked away from the Tv and towards me. He smiled softly.

Hello everyone,

Hope you're all doing well. I kind of made a new friend today, which is great I guess - but now I feel so incredibly anxious I don't know what to do. Got mixed feelings. If you've gone through something similiar, I would love to hear your experience!

[Sidenote: English isn't my first language so please bear with me and no pressure to read everything word to word, 'cause there's going to be a lot since I'm spiraling. :D]

So. I happened to meet this person at a bus stop today (so random lol) - they had recently arrived to my country and were lost and asked for help. After figuring out the suitable route for them, we ended up talking of many different things (studies/work/hobbies/interests etc.) while waiting for the bus. They also asked to exchange numbers, to which I agreed. We kept chatting on the bus until we got to their stop and then texted for a bit. They also asked me to let them know when I've got free time so we could go get a cup of coffee together or something.

Now I'm home feeling flabbergasted and anxious about the whole thing, since this was so out of nowhere. I was not mentally prepared and this wasn't in my plans for the day, lol. I'm trying not to overthink too much, but can't stop the spiraling... I think I should feel happy about this unexpected meeting but I just feel so anxious. It's a good thing to meet new people and make friends, I know this - and they were very sweet. It's just that they were so very  talkative and seem interesting/cool - and I'm the opposite... also the conversation happened in English and I'm rustyyy.

 I feel obligated to actually keep in contact with them cause they (asked for it and) seem nice and I don't want to be an a-s-s. However the anxiety is crushing me and I wish I could somehow go hide in a hole and avoid everything. What should I do...? How do I get ""over it""? I don't know if I'm just socially anxious or plain avoidant at this point T^T...

Rant over, thanks if you read this far. Feel free to share your thoughts.

1h93ela,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1h93ela/my_crush_with_schizophrenia_wont_let_me_in/,My crush with schizophrenia won’t let me in,"
Hi everyone,  

I’d love some advice from people with schizophrenia or those familiar with it about how to navigate my relationship with someone I deeply care for.  

I met him about two years ago at a local coffee shop. He was begging and when he came to me he stood out to me instantly, and I felt drawn to him and so did he cause he kept showing up and we kept running into each other. The attraction was instant and I never stopped running into him ever since. We’ve kinda learned each others schedules and that’s our only way of contact. Over time, I made an effort to connect with him, bringing him little things like snacks, clothes. I know he’s dealing with schizophrenia and possibly some other struggles, like addiction.  

At first, he was very distant and avoided eye contact, but I’ve noticed small signs of him letting me in. He allows me to visit his room now, which is a big step since he values his privacy.  He has moments of laughter around me, which feels like a window into his personality. He sometimes asks for things directly, which I interpret as a sign that he trusts me.  

That said, two years later, he remains very closed off emotionally. He does not speak much. He never asks anything about me. He rarely looks me in the eye and often keeps conversations very surface-level. He’s told me some personal things about him but he seems so shy too. Sometimes I feel like he’s grateful, but other times I worry that he just tolerates me out of necessity.  

I want to respect his boundaries while also building a deeper connection. How can I show him I’m here for him in a way that feels safe and comfortable for him? Are there ways I can help him open up without overwhelming him or making him feel pressured?  

Thank you!",1,1733608832.0,schizophrenia,0,1.0,False
1h93edp,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1h93edp/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1h93ea3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1h93ea3/did_my_mention_of_sex_while_hes_seeing_someone/,Did my mention of sex while he's seeing someone else cross a boundary or was it simply disinterest? I feel like I've been inappropriate.,"I'm going to be honest, I feel stupid about this and I could use some male perspective. 

I (26) had been on a date with a guy (36) first time since my late teens. We live countries apart and he told me he wanted to stay in touch, but not continue dating. He hoped to see me again in the future and mentioned how he hoped I wouldn't forget about him - he would ""consider"" dating me if I lived closer.

At first things were fine, but after a while things became incredibly unclear to me. 
One day he texted me he was seeing someone, but still hoped we could keep contact. I agreed. 

He's send a picture of himself in bed that same day to tell me he had ""this giant bed"" to himself, to which I joked I couldn't see the bed because I was in front of it. It seemed a little suggestive to me, and since he mentioned dating, I didn't want to cross that boundary.

A week later he texts to let me know he's visiting a certain city I wanted to go to, and by the end of the night, suggested I should come too. Again, I didn't take the hint, cause I genuinely didn't see it as a suggestion until I asked for him to clarify whether he meant he wanted to see me. His response: ""maybeee...""

We have a sexual history and he is honestly someone I genuinely care about, but I have feelings for him, and have a hard time managing that without wondering if I'm doing the wrong thing. 

A few weeks after having mentioned he was seeing someone, I felt he started to ignore me - something he hadn't done before. Initially he would still engage supportively, but as time went on, his responses took longer, to the point he would only respond to certain things and eventually not at all. I imagined it was because he was seeing someone and I was texting too often (I get excited talking to people I care about, but when I have feelings, often take that as a rejection of my presence). I didn't want to intrude his relationship so eventually decided I should better step back, which I did. 

However, I told him if things changed in the future and the opportunity would arise, I was open to seeing each other, have coffee or even the possibility of sex. I explicitly mentioned it, because I didn't want to burden him with the idea that I was still looking for him to date me, regardless of my feelings for him - and especially because his suggestions earlier on made me think that was what he was aiming for. So I wanted to take that ambiguity away. 

He since stopped responding and I wonder if he took offence because it was inappropriate given he (from what he told me) ""sort of started seeing"" someone, or whether it was simply because I told him I was going to take a step back after agreeing I wouldn't, or because he simply couldn't care less. I didn't want my ongoing interest in him to interfere with his current situation. ",1,1733608811.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

I'm ready to purchase a Micra, however its not clear to me what else I need in terms of accessories and water treatment and any other related coffee stuff... Please could you help and let me know what else I need to go with the machine...

I've had a couple of cheaper machines in the past (\~$500), so this is a major step up for us and are looking to learn... So,

1. I do have a grinder, it's a Rancilio Rocky and rather than get a new grinder immediately I'd like to see how well it does. If it doesn't do well then which grinder is recommended to pair with the Micra?
2. Water...?  Do I go with a high quality filter and use tap water, or I read of people using distilled and putting in additives. What is the best route and what water should I be using? (its not going to be plumbed in)
3. A scale... I'm thinking the Acaia Lunar, however saw a recent review by Lance Hedrick on the Bookoo scale... any steer on which one to get?
4. Do I need a dosing cup?
5. A tamping mat?
6. WDT stuff?
7. What else?

Is there anything that I'm missing or anything that you would recommend that would be important to have from the start?

All help, steer and guidance is gratefully received!

Thank you :)

Many new shooters tend to gravitate towards the semi-autos for obvious reasons, but have you ever considered a bolt gun?

There's a wide array of applications within the bolt-gun sphere. Everyone needs to find their niche. 

You can do the Rimfire PRS  route, the long range ELR builds, the Scout Rifle/Fighting Rifle route or if you take a shot of Tabasco in your coffee, the dangerous game big bore route. 

Plenty of attainable, highly customizable platforms like the CZ457, Tikka T3X, Bergara and Remington 700s. You can easily find a platform to utilize you .22, .223, 7,62x79, .308 etc.

Bolt-actions have an unrivaled selection of cartridge choices. Everything from .22LR to 505 Gibbs. 

Controlled round feed vs push feed. Detachable magazine vs box mag. Iron sites vs optics.   
Did I mention there are no magazine limits or minimum barrel lengths other than OAL. 

There are shooting sports and competitions that revolve around the bolt action rifles. PRS, Maple seed, ORA etc. 

Join us, at least until the next election. You might even like it.

But it seems like most of the time when I have people over at my house, they do inconsiderate things that annoy me. Even if I say something about it, they belittle my feelings and think it’s not a big deal, and keep doing it. I’ve made a post about a friend I had over at my house for dinner - he used my shower and then was picking between his toes before we had dinner and served ourselves from the same pizza and touching the same hot sauce bottles. I didn’t say anything in that instance because I felt like he would just act like I’m being unreasonable and a germophobe. I’ve also asked that friend on multiple occasions to not walk on the shag rug in my living room with shoes on, but I guess he just doesn’t care and forgets because I remind him and he ends up doing it anyway. 

Another time, my cousin stayed over after a concert and slept on my couch. I got a comforter and asked him to put it down on the couch because we were kinda dirty and sweaty from being in the crowd at the show. He was already laying down and refused to get up and just draped the comforter over himself. I was like “Whatever,” and just went to bed. 

I had another friend stay over after a different concert, and he asked if he could vape in my apartment. I said it was fine. A bit later, he took out a certain white powder and started snorting it. Like, you thought to ask permission before vaping in my apartment, but then you start doing actual drugs in my apartment without asking? When he went for a second bump, I was like “Do you really have to do that here?” The most I’ve done is smoke weed, and I don’t really have much knowledge of other drugs or their effects. I’m not necessarily against them, but I’d like to know if someone is going to bring them into my apartment and start taking bumps. And I usually feel uncomfortable being sober around people that are drunk or high - maybe due to childhood trauma from when my dad was an alcoholic. I was also like “Why would you do that here? Like what’s the point?” And he just said “Because it makes me feel like I’m floating on a cloud.” Like ok, I get that, but do drugs at the fkn concert, not in my living room. He just kinda dismissed me when I’m pretty sure he could tell it made me uncomfortable. He also walked on my living room rug with shoes on and put his dirty sweaty feet up on my coffee table. 

I’ve only had a couple friends that were conscientious enough to take their shoes off when they come into my apartment, and neither of them are in my life anymore. I don’t expect everyone to do things like that automatically, but I’d just like to not feel like the bad guy when I ask them to do things like not walk on my rug with shoes or not do drugs in my apartment.

The goal is to immortalize theater buildings and give people a chance to learn about movie theater buildings that are both open and closed down. For instance, a local chain can write about both their theater and chain company, which may have been forgotten over the years once they close down because they are only known locally. It gives theaters a chance to document their existence and history. That way, someone can look back at an inevitable abandoned movie theater and look it up and learn all about it when it was open. We could also document big cinematic historical events like Barbenheimer weekend or write articles about the concession and cinema equipment 

My question for you guys is this- if I did launch this project, would you guys be interested in contributing and writing about your theaters? If enough people are interested, I am willing to launch it.  I am also looking for people who are interested in getting involved creating/setting things up, so please reach out via chat if you are.

Below is a demo dummy theater article that I wrote, followed by examples of different infoboxes for theater chains. 

Would anyone be interested in this or not really? I am open to all feedback. Thank you so much!

I told him I have genital herpes and it was literally no issue to him at all. We started having unprotected sex after discussing std tests/results etc. He started rubbing me the wrong way after he started buying me gifts. He purchased me a new laptop for my birthday and delivered it to my work. He also bought me a vanity.

He keeps buying me gifts like extravagant dinners, dates etc. Here is another part that rubs me the wrong way. I gave him a key to my apartment (probably a mistake, as it is too soon) due to us being on totally opposite work schedules. I told him he could at least come in after he gets off work, and we could at least sleep together before I leave for my shift. He showed up unannounced once, he threw hints that he was coming but I didnt catch on. With breakfast food, alcohol, gifts. I expressed that it wasnt okay and to not do it again. 

 Today I called off work and didnt tell him. I’m asleep and all the sudden I hear banging on my door and him trying to get in. The door is deadbolted. I checked my phone and I didnt have any missed texts from him. I didnt want him to see me so I literally hide. The knocking stops and I look out the window, next thing you know he is knocking on my patio door….I go to open it and he asks why I was looking out the window..and that I’m “being weird”. He says he went to my work to deliver coffee and donuts and I wasnt there. Wanted to check that I was okay or didnt sleep in. I expressed that I was creeped out by this and now his feelings are hurt.

I bought an expensive 7 liter SIF because I need to make a quantity of decoction.  I've been experimenting with different amounts, but it variously clogs and doesn't drip or allows too many grounds through the holes.  I've probably tried 15 times to effectively brew with this big SIF.  (To be fair, I didn't experiment with grind size because I was using off the shelf chicory blend.)  

I finally gave up on it and tried out a French press.  Worked like a charm and I don't have to worry about the filter clogging and over-extracting or a grimy result.  It's easy to control the exact time of the brew this way too.  

Just my experience.  It's probably much easier to use an SIF for smaller quantities.",1,1733607444.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

We got engaged one year ago, and our relationship is perfect, or so I thought.

Initially, we planned to have a big wedding on May 3rd, but because of the family issues on both sides (health stuff, no fights of anything dramatic) we decided to cancel the ""big wedding"" and just get married with only our parents and siblings present in January. He was the one who proposed that, I agreed and we've told all of our families and friends. 

Well, fast forward, this whole week he's been acting a little bit off. Anytime I asked what's wrong, he assured me that everything is okay and that he's just tired. That sounded completely viable since he's working 9 to 5, goes to gym and then works his side job until he passes out literally. So I said that I understand and didn't bother him much. 

Last night I woke up randomly in the middle od the night and I see he's not there. (He usually comes to bed after me so I'm used to falling asleep alone). It was 4AM so I got scared and jumped out of bed, to find him sleeping in the living room. Again I was like okay, he probably fell asleep Watching TV, so I woke him up and told him to go to bed. He said okay, I'm coming but he never did. 
This morning we were just sitting, drinking our morning coffee and he asks me if I was mad he didn't sleep in the bed. I said I was scared at first, but not mad, I didn't think I had reason to be mad. I jokingly said ""I was sad because I thought you don't wanna sleep with me"" and he said yes. At that point I was really confused and asked wtf, do we have an issue I'm not aware of. He said he's been thinking the whole week and he ""thinks he's 99% sure he doesn't want to get married"". I was in shock and asked him what is he talking about. He said he just doesn't want to get married at all, it's not about me. Well now I'm even more shocked because on our first date we literally talked about marriage and kids, and that it is important to us and something we both want. And we talked about it million times. I asked him does he want to breakup, and he said he doesn't know. He swears he loves me, and that I am ""love of his life"" but goes back to saying he doesn't want to get married. 

I've been spiraling the whole day. I don't know what to say or do. For context his parents have really bad marriage, a lot of his friends got divorced so I'm trying to find excuse for him that maybe he got scared overnight, but still it breaks my heart. I don't want to talk about this with my parents or friends because I don't want to ruin his image in their eyes, everyone likes him a lot and have really high opinion of him.

P.s. we started discussing it, but I said I'm in too much pain and I need some time to process everything he told me, so I would be able to have sane and calm conversation. He understood and told me to tell him when I'm ready to talk. But I'm too scared, I don't want to lose him and our relationship and I'm afraid that's what's coming. Please help

1h92plq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiamiHurricanes/comments/1h92plq/story_time/,Story Time,"I was born in NY in the early 90's. My dad is not a sports fans so I had free rein to choose my sports fandoms. If you asked 10 year old me which athletes are living legends, Gods amongst men walking this Earth, the answers would have been Derek Jeter, Michael Jordan, Brian Leetch and Mark Messier, Hines Ward, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. With The Rock's alma mater being Miami I loved the Canes, but at the same time I was a kid and didn't quite conceptualize the importance of a rivalry that didn't involve the Yankees and Red Sox so I loved the Gators as well because of their success in that era. These alliances stuck with me for a long time, roundabout a decade, until I had a family member go to UF when I was 16 and at that point Miami took a backseat and for the past 15 years or so my love for the Gators has grown and grown while the affinity for the Canes has wained more and more year after year. 

That brings me to Aug 31, 2024. I live in the south now, a reasonable distance from Gainesville, so there was no chance I was missing that game. I had been to Ben Hill Griffin before but it had been a little more than a decade since I watched Alabama put a beating on the Gators right at the spark of their dynasty. I was pumped, really thought we had a chance, didn't think it was a sure thing by any means but any given Saturday, you know? On my road trips I always play a game where I try to see how high I can get the ""miles until empty"" indicator to be after filling up my tank, it never hit 600 miles until that morning when I stopped about 20 miles outside of Gainesville so I could fill up before the game in preparation to just hit the road once it was time to leave. I thought this was a good omen, thought this was a sure fire sign that the Gators would achieve victory, a God Nod that more good was to come on this day. As the hours progressed I would come to learn this was the only win I was to be granted on this day. 

I sat on the Gators side of the stadium, about thirty rows up. By the time the 2nd quarter was ending I could feel the fact that any and all energy in the stadium had been used up, the sideline looked defeated, completely void of any passion. I left halfway through the 4th quarter, my hopes were dashed and had been for some time now. I remember walking out and seeing a fellow fan wearing a shirt that said ""SUCKS TO BE U"". Indeed it did, it sucked to be me, to be us, I was so disappointed by the way the Gators played that day, still am. After a 15 minute walk back to my car I turned onto the street where I parked, I was about 200 yards from some nice cool air conditioning at least, something to look forward to. Roughly halfway through this final part of the trek I encountered a UM fan who can be described in many ways but I will just call him a jerk. He was speaking on the phone looking right at me saying very loudly ""They're not even saying anything, they got their asses kicked and they have nothing to say, no shit to talk, they can't do nothing!"" I looked at him and said, ""You guys won in a blowout, what do you expect for any of us to say?"" He laughed at me and said ""That's right you can't say nothing!"" I smiled right back and replied ""Well I will say this, I guarantee you guys will not win the ACC."" Which brings us to today. 

I am so so delighted, I am happy I was right, I am happy your hopes and dreams this season were crushed, I am happy you are not making the playoff, I am happy that somewhere that Canes fan is sitting on his couch telling himself he will watch every football game there is today except for the ACC Championship because of how disgusted he is. It makes me feel truly delightful to know that you all missed the Championship game meanwhile a team that has been in your conference for a cup of coffee has the chance to go out and win it on their first try in their first year. You all deserve this. I cannot wait for next year, cannot wait for DJ Lagway to dice up your secondary and entire fanbase on your home turf once you are without your fraud of a Heisman candidate quarterback. Every team the Gators lost to this year was a top 25 ranked team at some point this season. Y'all lost to Georgia Tech and Syracuse. Y'all some bums. Y'all did not deserve to be playing today. U's down bad. All U's. U's deserve it. So with all that said, GO GATORS!",0,1733606878.0,MiamiHurricanes,13,0.38,False

1h92oap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1h92oap/my_husband_left_me_for_another_woman_long_rant/,My husband left me for another woman : long rant ,"Thursday night my husband left. He's done this once before, last October. It's like he gets overwhelmed and just leaves. He said ""I'm leaving. I can't do this anymore."" What followed was days of absolute sorrow and grief while trying to juggle being a stay at home mom. After a couple days he began to reach out, showing remorse. Remorse doesn't even seem like the right word. He came over bawling, down right begging me not to make him leave. He said he wanted me as his wife that he loved me more than anything, wanted our family and that he absolutely never wanted a divorce. He went on and on, saying all the right things because I accepted him back. He was being kind the next few days, even going out of his way to help me with a donation campaign I was running for our local shelter by wrapping a huge box and putting it at his workplace for collections. He kissed me on the forehead every day and hugged me when I was dealing with confusion and sadness he caused. 

More so, he was planning couples counseling for us and had gotten back into therapy. He went to the doctors and got a Prozac prescription after we had a long talk about depression. He was certain that was what was causing all of his problems. He also sat down and had a long talk with our children, (10,8,2) and promised them he would not leave again. Our 8 year old has been in therapy and this last time he left was especially hard on her. 

Last night, a week since he left the last time, four days since he was back home after his begging and sobbing, he came home after work. I was waiting for him, excited to go to the Christmas tree farm the following day, thinking about the weekend with him and my kids, and he walked right up to me and said ""I'm in love with someone else."" He immediately began to sob and said he can't ""live this lie"" anymore.

I have never experienced disassociation until that moment. It felt like I was looking out of someone else's eyes. My body went absolutely numb. I felt like I had been drugged. 

I think the only words I spoke in that moment were ""what"" and then ""who"". My next reaction was to call my mom because I was on the verge of a breakdown and I knew it. I couldn't be alone with my kids. He sat there while I sobbed on the phone to my mom. Then he asked to see the kids, which I said no to - not because I'm going to keep our children from him but because it would not be healthy for them to come down in the middle of this and listen to their dad give them some crap excuse about why he can't stay while he cries like a victim. I asked some questions, like ""who is it"" he didn't want to tell me. I said ""you love her and she loves you?"" And he said yes. I asked ""so you're going to bring our kids over to this woman's house"" (I was not fully present, my questions were not well thought out) he said ""eventually."" I said more things, I remember saying ""you have something so deeply wrong with you, not even Prozac can fix it."" He stood there and cried. I told him to get out and he did. 

I packed things and went to my moms, where I'm at right now. 

He told me it was the mom of a friend of our kids. This one person I had been suspicious about in the past, but for a seemingly dumb reason then. My husband and her texted ""only to set up sleep overs."" I found this odd, since my stepson had a fully functioning mom and my husband never was the point of contact for things for our other kids. I told him it made me uncomfortable and just felt weird but knowing I was being kind of immature about it I let it go. I should not have let it go.

This child is in my daughters class. We live in a town of 2100 people. I don't know how to cope with that. How to send my kid to school to possibly hear ""your dad and step brother were at my house last night."" Or ""your dad was kissing my mom."" 

I am absolutely devestated. I'm confused. I'm deeply sad. I feel sick. I can't eat. I never wanted anything but to grow old with him. He was my person. The person I texted when funny things happened to me, the person I drank coffee with every morning while we made lunches together, the person I laid in bed with every night. I can't quit crying. I can't stop the invasive thoughts. I am crushed that all the things I wanted him to do with me, he has been doing and will do with her. We had a good life and a good marriage. It's three weeks until Christmas. I have help with my kids right now but I feel terrible that I cannot get my shit together at this moment and be more present. I am trying to survive every moment.

He encouraged me to quit my job to stay home full time with our kids about a month ago, so I have no income. I took 6500 dollars out of our savings this morning and left him with over 2,000 dollars. I felt so guilty doing this. But I have to look out for my kids. He texted me to ask how the kids are - are you serious? They're terrible. We're all terrible. He asked why I took out money like that, I didn't reply and he said it wasn't all mine to take. I sent him one text explaining why I took the money and told him not to contact me and that if he needed anything urgently he could contact my mom for now. He hasn't messaged me since - very different from the last time he left when he was texting me constantly saying he loved and missed us and had made a mistake. 

I am wrecked. I feel like I will not survive this. I cannot imagine ever loving anyone again. Or giving anyone a piece of my heart, or even my attention. Because he is still there. It feels like he will always just be there. I will always only want him and he will never want me. 

I am changing diapers and trying to cry in private while he is happy with this new person who is so amazing in his eyes, it was worth giving up everything we've built. 

I am so lost. Someone tell me their story. How they came out on the other side. Please, I am losing it. I am in pieces.

An infobox with the following message:

>[*2025 wall calendar*](https://shop.latinmassdir.org/)

>*Dec 7, 2024*

>*Own the Latin Mass Directory 2025 calendar featuring beautiful digitally restored images of historic churches. Your purchase supports the work of the Directory. Order today!*

They appear to have opened a new online shop to help fun the Directory's running costs. They're selling 2 things at the moment, a 2025 liturgical wall calendar (a US and Canada version and non USA and Canada version) and a mug with 2 colour variants. This is the message they have put at the top of their [shop page](https://shop.latinmassdir.org/):

>*Welcome*

>*Dec 7, 2024: The Latin Mass Directory Gift Shop is Now Open*

>*The Latin Mass Directory 2025 calendar is here, showcasing breathtaking digitally restored images of historic churches. It makes a thoughtful Christmas gift for loved ones—or a beautiful addition to your own home.*

>*Every purchase supports the mission of the Directory: spreading the truth and beauty of the traditional Latin Mass.*

>*Looking for something different? Choose one of our elegant mugs—perfect for your morning coffee or cozy winter warmer.*

>*Prefer to give directly? Simply go to our* [*donations*](https://www.latinmassdir.org/donate/) *page.*

I personally think it's a good idea and what they are selling doesn't seem like rubbish either and has actual use, especially the liturgical calendar. I obviously haven't seen these things in person but they appear to be of actual quality as well. In my opinion it is a good step to keep the Directory afloat and a vector for people to be able to support the project's continued existence while getting something useful in return, other than the obvious utility that the Directory has in and of itself.

I have no idea how much the Directory actually costs to run on a monthly basis, or how many people donate to it and how much that amounts to. [They say a bit about it on their website](https://www.latinmassdir.org/about/) but don't really go into too many details:

>*How do I support the Latin Mass Directory?*

>*In addition to the many hours a month required to maintain the Latin Mass Directory, the directory also incurs monthly domain, server, and third-party software expenses. If you would like to support this work financially, please make a donation.*

>*The Latin Mass Directory’s mission is to glorify God through the traditional Latin Mass, to help spread the truth and beauty of this sublime and ancient liturgy, and to do so within the official structures of the Catholic Church under the authority of the bishops and Pope Francis.*

>*The directory incurs monthly domain, server, and third-party software expenses in addition to many hours of maintenance and development work. In order to cover these costs and in order to continue providing accurate information to thousands of visitors each day ad free, please consider supporting the directory.*

>*Thank you and God Bless.*

I have used the Directory for years both as a resource and also by contributing to it as an editor so I probably have more time on and experiencing using the website than most. As an aside the admins are the people who actually own and run the Directory, there are at least 2 of them as far as I know, while editors like myself are just volunteers who contribute in their free time to updating the Directory like Wikipedia or something similar. The Directory is one of the most valuable resources that exists in the world of the Latin Mass and traditional Catholicism and it would be an unmitigated castastrophe if it were to ever go offline or God forbid disappear entirely.

1h92fzg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h92fzg,My issue with tea containers.,"So, bit of a rant about storage containers. I think it’s relatively fair to say that most serious tea enjoyers will store their tea in the original mylar bags, ziplocks, or tin canisters (generally the double seal-style containers)

Excluding for the sake of this specific conversation: the various aging/storage methods of pu’erh. 

I’m aware it’s also quite common for folks to use glazed clay/porcelain jars, the tops having those (airtight-ish) fabric stoppers. 

So in my case, I’m relatively content with merely leaving my teas in their original Mylar  baggies as I drink 95% of my tea stash in 1-3 months, tops. But some teas I have, I sometimes manage to get a LOT of (250g+) and I find myself with these annoyingly large issues: (speaking specifically about the double seal tin containers that are very common, such as Kotodo’s) 


They’re not commonly bigger than 100g. Generally they’re even quite tiny— mind you, for ball-rolled teas such as some oolongs, this obviously isn’t an issue but with teas with larger, more delicate leaves, you need that extra volume to fit it all. The tins I generally find all over the american internet are almost always 50g-100g (roughly). And 100g ones are not common— and when I can find 100g containers, the second main issue I have with these tin canisters comes into play:

The seals. Obviously not 100% airtight vaccum, but in the time it takes to enjoy your teas you’ve bought within a year? The good ones will feel quite airtight. 

But generally? These things SUCK. Notably, for the 2nd seal as pictured. The tolerance/quality control of these things are literally _ALL OVER_ the place. Some, like Kotodo, have decent quality control and feel quite snug, especially when you slide the cover over and hear the air leave with a satisfying (fwooooooshhhhhzzz). Especially if the ‘rail’ for the slip cover is long, I feel like it gives the air more time to be pushed out of the container, rather than many out there with rails that are only a 1/3rd of an inch. Okay great. Now I just want this without branding or washi paper in a 150g-250g variant. 

However,  I love modern storage and wouldn’t mind at all using a modern solution like a handful of the brands out there using small electronic decompressors to force the air out, (eg, atmos, those black lid ones from temu with the wooden buttons in the middle, corkcicle, etc) and those would be fine , if, again, the reviews were anything but consistent. These things ain’t gonna last. And if you even happen to get a good unit, they’re also very small, as they’re moreso meant for coffee beans. 

TLDR: mylar bags are of course, completely fine. But if you want a more compact storage solution like tin/stainless steel/clay/porcelain canisters/jars/containers— there are SCARCE examples of quality (forget BIFL) options for 95%+ airtight containers out there on the western internet.

Am I massively overthinking this? It’s been on my mind for months, tired of buying awful quality canisters off of temu/amazon/aliexpress etc and being disappointed in the size or tolerance of the double seal. I want to enjoy tea again without thinking about this stress! ",2,1733606096.0,tea,6,1.0,False

Bread intimidated me so i never did it. A family member told me about sourdough briefly and how to do a starter. I just used AP flour and it was working fine. I actually really liked the smell.

Well anyway, i eventually killed it off bc i was tired of keeping up with it and didnt see myself baking anytime soon. Now im back into baking and stopped buying bread so i need to make it. I dont wanna buy yeast at the store all the time so i wanna make a new starter. I got a book because i wanted more knowledge about sourdough in general. I followed the books guide to making sourdough starter.

Previously i was just using measuring cups to make starter, and just kinda eyeballed it to make it the right consistency, like pancake batter sort of. I got a scale finally and have been using that. The book says to start with 4oz water, 4oz whole wheat flour. I did that, day 2 and beyond was the same but with bread flour instead of whole wheat. It did not say to discard any till day 5 or so. Well i started one but didnt cover it right and it dried up weird on top, so i restarted. And it smelled like crap on day 3. So i restarted again. I think im on my third try and i am wasting flour and its pissing me off because i got good quality flour and im wasting it. The book said it should smell sour, and my prior starter smelled sour but good like a yeasty kind of smell. The book says if it smells like the bottom of a trash can and is dark in color, its bad. The second starter i tried had both of those qualities. The current on, the third try, i decided to do AP flour on day 1 and bread flour on the subsequent days. The color is good, it is day 3 now but has not been fed yet today. But it literally smells like the bottom of a trash can. I cant even keep the container open because its nauseating, it’s horrific. My old starter NEVER smelled like this.  And it keeps doing this on the early days. Idk how this is happening.

Its super jiggly today and i didnt think it would rise so when i fed it last night in a big jar on day 2 i wasnt worried about it overflowing. But i woke up to a bunch of starter stuck on the coffee filter i used to cover the jar. So clearly it did rise last night. Its all bubbly and jiggly. Ill add a pic.

I literally don’t know what to do. Is this book the problem or am i doing something wrong??? Wrong flour? Ive kept it in the same spot i kept my last starter. The area is quite warm. They are under-cabinet lights we leave on for the cats because they like to lay under them for the warmth.

He wasn't very comfortable and his condition was less than ideal, but he was too tired to change or clean himself, and so there he laid on his bed, repeating the scenario in his head, as if watching a movie. when he got inside, Josh's mother almost fainted. He was covered in dirt and mud from the waist down and the grass stains on his blazer and trousers made it look as though he'd dyed his clothes green. without words, he shamefully ran past her, nearly pushing her over with his shoulder as he left a trail of muddy footprints leading to his door, which slammed shut with such force that he could've sworn he'd felt the whole house shake. Not as much as him, though. He was shaking like an addict suffering withdrawal and, to an extent, that's exactly what he was. He was addicted to that feeling he got when he was with her.

**Get over** it he told himself, although he knew it wasn't that easy. **It was obviously gonna happen at some point, she was way out of your league** he thought in an attempt to console himself, which ultimately failed. ""A-Are you ok in there, Josh?"" His mother asked. He stayed silent. ""Do you want me to come in?"". ""No, thank you"" replied Josh, inexpressively, although this was the opposite of how he truly felt. He wanted consolidation, someone to tell him that it was going to be alright, but he couldn't let her see him like this, so pathetic, so vulnerable. ""Pathetic and vulnerable"" he chuckled, ""that's pretty accurate, isn't it?"" He wasn't sure who he was asking, but before he could think too much about it he was interrupted. ""Did you say something?"" his mother asked. ""Oh-uh, no no I didn't say anything!"" Josh said, quickly trying to regain his composure. ""Oh, ok... well just know I'm here if you need anything, and you can call me if you want to speak, I'll be in the kitchen so I'll be able to hear."" ""Thanks, mum"" he replied, before falling back onto his bed, and into a somber state as he recalled the moments he'd had with her.

She was amazing in every sense of the word, even her name, Azalea. she was on par with models, and she would probably be one if she wanted to, but no, she didn't want to be a model, or anything of the such, **she wanted to be mine, even if just for a while, even if just for laughs, she wanted me, and I wanted her** Josh laughed, loud enough to hide the sobs, but his throat was getting tight and soon enough, there was no laughter, only a croaky voice that resonated across the room. He laid on his stomach, his cries muffled and tears absorbed by the pillows. It was hard to breath, but it was a nice feeling, a struggle with no consequence to succumbing to, you can just turn your head, or roll over, simple solutions. but what about now? It's not like he could make her stay with him, not if she didn't want to. 

**Why is it so complicated?** he thought. What did I do wrong?. Nothing came to mind, no matter how hard he strained his brain, and then it hit him. **Nothing, I didn't do anything, did I. She simply got bored, because of course she did, I'm not rich, I can't take her places she'd like, I'm not important, it doesn't make her popular by being with me, I'm only loving and caring, I can only give her my heart, no traction, no jewelry, just my love, and of course that's not enough, it never is, it never will be, you're gonna need more than that if you wanna keep them, won't you?**

His tone had become bitter, and yet he wanted to savour it. it felt great acknowledging his feelings when no one else woul-no, when no one else could. there were people willing to listen, but he wasn't willing to speak, to share what he was feeling, and this had stood true throughout all of his life. He knew it was stupid, but he didn't want people to see him in the state he laid in now. ""Pathetic"" He mumbled ""I'm pathetic."" He rose from the bed, clenching his fists dense as rock, shaking not in pain, but rather resentment for the pitiful sight he'd let himself become, all because of some girl. **who cares if she doesn't want me?** He told himself, although the thought of it still made him teary-eyed. **God dammit, why'd she have to be so perfect, and why did she even ask me anyway if she was just gonna leave me in a few months?** He rubbed his eyes and was surprised to find tears falling down his cheek. He went to the mirror and jumped back at the sight. He was a mess, both mentally and physically.

When Azalea had asked him to speak with her privately, he was thrilled. Their relationship had been slow after the first few weeks, and he thought that she might have wanted to speak to him about progressing, and she did. She wanted to progress. She wanted to move on, and be with someone more ""compatible"", more complementing to her nature, not someone who ""can't meet my needs"". Josh was speechless as he stood there, silent for what must have been a while because Azalea had begun to speak again. ""Look, I know it's not easy to hear, but you're just not my type anymore."" This time, she was met with tears, racing down an empty face, seemingly vacant from the world, as his eyes focused on the stars too far to see, at the other side of reality, where he wished he could be. Away from the crowd of insecurities that gazed down at him from heights he wished he could fall from. But he couldn't. He couldn’t think, he couldn’t speak, he was no longer following his brain’s orders, nor his heart’s requests, but rather his instincts. And his instincts were telling him to run. He ran-through the gatherings of kids, through the gates, across the road and into the forest he went through everyday to get home, and yet now seemed unfamiliar, unknown, much like everything else. Nevertheless, he still ran, over the roots that stuck out on the path and through the puddles formed in the pooling of a depression, much like him.

""That's it."" josh exclaimed quietly, ""I need some fresh air, and some fresh clothes by the looks of it."" He opened his wardrobe and picked out the first clothes he saw. **It's not like it matters, nobody's gonna see me anyway, not in the middle of the woods...** He undressed and almost had a heart attack when he saw himself. The mud from his trousers had sunk through onto his legs and he looked like a swamp monster, with red puffy eyes and cuts all over from the branches he ran through, which he didn't even feel at the time. He immediately jumped into the shower and turned it on, full blast. The water was scalding hot, but somewhat soothing. It reminded him of the time he went to the beach with Azalea and the sand was too hot to stand on, and when he spilled her coffee all over himself when she asked him to hold it. They were fond memories, making them harder to think about. He stood under the searing water, watching the steam rise and feeling tears fall, taking shallow breaths as the temperature became bearable, whilst the pain in his chest got worse. he didn't bother with soap or shampoo, he only rinsed his legs and cleaned the cuts. when he stepped out of the shower, he looked like a different person compared to his former self, except for the puffy red eyes, which seemed to have only grown. He dried himself, put on the fresh clothes and approached his door. He hesitated before grabbing the handle, questioning whether he's ready, but dismissed the thought. He couldn't stay in his room forever, and he needed some time outside anyway. He turned the handle and slowly pushed the door open, trying to make as little sound as he could, to not disturb his mother, although this proved unsuccessful when he heard a voice. ""Are you going somewhere, hun?"" his mother asked. ""yea, I think some fresh air would do me good"" he replied. ""Ok, well take some food with you, you might get hungry."" ""Oh ok, I'll grab something from the cupboard and go."" Josh went to the kitchen and was hit with a smell so strong it almost blew his hair back. ""What's that smell?"" He queried ""It's chicken and rice, do you want some of that instead?"" She asked, grinning ear to ear. ""yes please."" he said, barely concealing his enthusiasm. ""I knew you would, well there's a tub in the fridge, you can take that with you"" ""Thank you"" ""No worries, just don't be gone for TOO long, ok?"" ""ok, mum"" ""Good, now go get some fresh air"" ""Goodbye mum, see you later""

When he stepped outside, it was as though he'd stepped back into the world he was familiar with. The gentle breeze gave him a soothing chill, and the barking dogs gave a sense of nostalgia, as if he'd matured over the past hour, and comparatively, he had. He felt almost new, he felt he could leave all drama in the past and begin again, with no regrets. He proudly advanced towards the forest, uncaring of what people thought about him, after all, why should he be? They don't even know him, and it's unlikely that he'd ever see them again anyway. Hell, he felt he could dance his way to the forest and back, swinging his shirt in circles above his head without a care in the world. He made it to the forest quicker than he expected, and sauntered through the trees, admiring the life that had grown and lived there for generations, through winters and summers, autumns and springs, through rain and storms and countless disasters, and to still be here, unfazed, standing taller than any building we could hope to construct. The thought of this made him further realize how childish he had acted, as though it was the end of his days, when it was merely the beginning. The storm had come early for him, but this only meant a head-start from his peers. To think he was willing to chop himself down to avoid the rain, unaware that its necessary for growth, was a shameful thought, a mindset long forgotten, and rightfully banished from his new perspective.",2,1733605552.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Because your internal and external voices are not in sync with one another; they are not both working as one in the moment. I realized this many years ago, in my early forties and when I learned how to keep them in sync, the change was amazing. Let me explain.

We are all aware of the voice in our head that generally is running like a background announcer constantly talking to us about various and mostly irrelevant things. Here’s an example of what that voice in our head might be doing at a given moment. Imagine a guy walks into a coffee shop (this isn’t the beginning of a joke):

“Hmmm. It is cold in this coffee shop. Why can’t they ever get the temperature right in here. I guess it is always a day behind the temperature outside. Oh, Cassie is working today. She is cute, and damn, I forgot to shave. Two people in line ahead of me. That means it will be my turn in a second. I want a mocha and a muffin. Let me practice saying my order in my head so I don’t look like an idiot when I order. Hmm…she changed her hair color again. I liked it better before I think. How are other people so smooth when they order...why am I so tense. Ok. Practice…“I want a mocha and a muffin.” Wait, do I want a muffin… Maybe oatmeal would be healthier. Hmm…great, now there is an attractive woman behind me and she is going to hear me sound like an idiot when I order. Oh, what size mocha do I want…fuck, it’s my turn… “I’ll have a mocha coffee, small, I mean tall, and a oatmeal muffin….” - Damn it. I’m such an idiot.

Now, what happens if we just turn off the thought stream happening in our head, refuse to rehearse at all, until it is actually time to order. “Hey Cassie. I’ll have a tall mocha and a pumpkin cream cheese muffin. Thanks.” I mean, how hard is it to just say that. Why would I ever need to rehearse at all…

That voice in our head is mostly the bane of our existence. It has a good and important purpose, but almost none of us use it for that purpose. We let it run amok and so it creates a host of problems for us in our day-to-day conversations, and truly in our lives.

Pay attention to your stress levels and you will find that when that voice is going on in the fashion noted above, it physically jacks up your blood pressure. A simple experiment is to walk or run on a treadmill that is monitoring your heart rate, usually through the handles. As you warm up, grab the handles to check your heart rate in your “normal” state of functioning (meaning with your mind wandering in its usual way). Then, turn off the thought stream. (Easier said than done, but try.) Generally, this will result in a kind of heavy feeling in the top middle portion of your brain - you can actually feel it when you learn to pay close attention. If you can achieve that feeling, your heart rate will begin to drop, often as much as ten to fifteen beats, just by turning off the thought stream running amok.

The question, of course, is how do we keep that thought stream from running amok. In a sense, meditation is about turning off that voice in our heads, but I think meditation misses the mark. Meditating is a bit like trying to balance on the head of a pin, and it throws the baby out with the bathwater. Remember, that internal voice does have a purpose. The voice in my head is very helpful to me, so long as I stay in the moment, either speaking without rehearsing, or thinking about things the unconscious mind is driving me to consider. However, if you haven’t paid much attention to the unconscious you might not know what it is trying to do for us, so you will have to learn this first.

But here are a few hints. Boredom doesn’t exist merely to annoy us. Boredom is your unconscious telling you it is intellectually hungry and you need to give it something deep to ponder. Curiosity, which is closely aligned with boredom, is your unconscious telling you what intellectual things you will find interesting and rewarding if you look deeper, if you spend more time with it.

However, there are lots of things the unconscious doesn’t care about, so if you do these instead, you will feel stress, not relaxation. The unconscious does not give a rat’s about the attractive girl behind you in line at the coffee shop, or how I sound when I make my order at a coffee shop. It wants to think about more interesting and complex things, not have us wasting time on silly stuff. For me, what is interesting is how the mind works, or physics, the nature of morality, or a play that I am interested in writing. Last night, when I ran on the treadmill at my gym, I spent the entire time thinking about a screenplay I want to write that is a sequel to the movie - Good Will Hunting - an idea that I have had for a long time. So I was thinking about the opening scene, the general plot lines, the characters, etc., all while I was running. I hardly noticed that I was running and so I was able to run longer and with less effort than usual.

Sometimes, I will sing when I run, which helps eliminate that noisy voice by focusing it on something relatively creative, and even better if I am making up lyrics as I run rather than trying to remember a song. My last workout I literally made up lyrics for over 35 minutes while I was running - in other words, I was constantly thinking in the moment and creatively. I was not thinking about what I had to do next, after I was done with my workout. I was not thinking about the pain I was in while running and how many more minutes I had to run. I was not thinking about what I had to do the next day or what I had done earlier in the day. I wasn’t replaying whatever silly thing I might have done or said that made me look foolish to someone. I was in the moment and I was relaxed.

When talking with others, we often have the thoughts we would actually say, if we were not concerned with what the person might think, and then we have another line of thought trying to gauge the person’s (or persons’) reactions, or potential reactions, and whether the social situation makes it appropriate for us to say what we really think or whether this will piss off our friend, boss, significant others, etc. So as we try to speak, we are trying to change our verbal expression to match the social appropriateness of the situation, which puts our conscious desires in conflict with what would naturally come out if we just let ourselves speak.

Often, we choose not speak at all because we are unsure whether we should, then we become frustrated at ourselves that we didn’t speak. The next time we might well react to our frustration by forcibly blurting out something. This might well be inappropriate because it was also forced, and less about our accurate thoughts, experienced in the moment, than about our prior frustration with ourselves over not speaking previously. So, we end up sounding angry, despite trying to be expressive due to the frustration from the prior inhibition. This is part of the learning process, and it highlights why we sometime experience a stumbling way of speaking.

My suggestion is you try some little experiments in your life. In situations that you know will not get you into much trouble, speak your mind without any rehearsing or filtering. Really, don’t rehearse - turn that shit off - just speak your thoughts out loud as they come to you; let the river flow. Also, don’t fear silence, particularly when you are with someone new. Often, that voice will pop up in these moments of silence and off it runs like a horse scared by a gunshot. Silence is find; let it be. You can start by doing this when you order things at restaurants or coffee shops. Hopefully, you can also do it with a friend or significant other. You might want to tell them what you are working on, so they know why you are being a little different than usual - and you will be different when you stop monitoring yourself.

What I have found, invariably, is that I am much more relaxed, interesting, and even funny, when I just let my thought stream come out as my voice without any filter or rehearsing. There is none of the tongue-tied stuff when your conscious mind and unconscious mind are not conflicted. But depending on how much you have been holding back, initially, there will be a kind of forced element to it until you learn to really speak what you are thinking without filtering/rehearsing it, without practicing first in your head, without putting on a persona when you speak...

Also, try not to let that internal voice hijack your mind no matter what you are doing. One good indicator is whether you are feeling stress. Try to learn to be aware of any stress arising within, even the slightest amount. If you feel yourself getting stressed, it is nearly always because that voice is running in your head and you didn’t realize it. When you feel stress, look inward, stop or slow down whatever you are doing, and see if the voice is running amok; if so, relax your mind, and it will turn off.

Even pay attention to your walking speed in life. Most people walk at the speed of their stress level. They never even know what their normal walking speed is when stress is nonexistent - it is generally much slower than you normally walk. Eventually, the more aware you become, the more quickly you will be able to feel how the heaviness in your brain, of which I spoke earlier, is associated with relaxation. Consequently, when you identify the stress you are feeling, you will be able to create the heaviness that comes when you turn off the pointless thought stream, or redirect it into something the unconscious wants you to consider. In a real sense, the two feelings, relaxation and that physical heaviness in the brain, are identic.

You may well notice it permeate your entire body. It wasn’t until I started doing this that I realized how often, when I was just sitting, my body was tense and rigid. The more aware and congruent your conscious and unconscious mind become, the less tension your body will hold.

All of this takes a lot of personal awareness. You can only do it consistently if you have some complex things to think about; things that are original and creative in nature; otherwise, that voice will start to run amok again. Artists often appear relaxed because their conscious and unconscious minds are congruent with one another.

Complex things are the thoughts your unconscious really wants the internal voice to be directed toward. When you direct them in that way, no stress occurs and existing stress disappears. A misdirected internal voice is like a child causing all sorts of problems because he or she is just bored. Once you direct “him” or “her” in the right way, he or she becomes adorable, fun to be around, relaxed.

Adults are just more complex children. So, you might have to start reading, writing, painting, singing, sculpting, dancing, playing sports, doing yoga… Find your passion and make it a priority in your life, even if it has nothing to do with your work - which it probably doesn’t. Then, when that internal voice wants to run amok, direct it toward your passion so it can’t perseverate on silly things, messing up your speaking voice because of the conflict with the unconscious.

There are many ways to give the internal voice the complexity it needs, but it requires a completely different set of ideas which most people, honestly, spend almost no time considering in their lives.

But depending on how much you have been holding back, initially, there will be a kind of forced element to it until you learn to really speak what you are thinking without filtering/rehearsing it, without practicing first in your head, without putting on a persona when you speak...

Also, try not to let that internal voice hijack your mind no matter what you are doing. One good indicator is whether you are feeling stress. Try to learn to be aware of any stress arising within, even the slightest amount. If you feel yourself getting stressed, it is nearly always because that voice is running in your head and you didn’t realize it. When you feel stress, look inward, stop or slow down whatever you are doing, and see if the voice is running amok; if so, relax your mind, and it will turn off.

Even pay attention to your walking speed in life. Most people walk at the speed of their stress level. They never even know what their normal walking speed is when stress is nonexistent - it is generally much slower than you normally walk. Eventually, the more aware you become, the more quickly you will be able to feel how the heaviness in your brain, of which I spoke earlier, is associated with relaxation. Consequently, when you identify the stress you are feeling, you will be able to create the heaviness that comes when you turn off the pointless thought stream, or redirect it into something the unconscious wants you to consider. In a real sense, the two feelings, relaxation and that physical heaviness in the brain, are identic.

You may well notice it permeate your entire body. It wasn’t until I started doing this that I realized how often, when I was just sitting, my body was tense and rigid. The more aware and congruent your conscious and unconscious mind become, the less tension your body will hold.

All of this takes a lot of personal awareness. You can only do it consistently if you have some complex things to think about; things that are original and creative in nature; otherwise, that voice will start to run amok again. Artists often appear relaxed because their conscious and unconscious minds are congruent with one another.

Complex things are the thoughts your unconscious really wants the internal voice to be directed toward. When you direct them in that way, no stress occurs and existing stress disappears. A misdirected internal voice is like a child causing all sorts of problems because he or she is just bored. Once you direct “him” or “her” in the right way, he or she becomes adorable, fun to be around, relaxed.

Adults are just more complex children. So, you might have to start reading, writing, painting, singing, sculpting, dancing, playing sports, doing yoga… Find your passion and make it a priority in your life, even if it has nothing to do with your work - which it probably doesn’t. Then, when that internal voice wants to run amok, direct it toward your passion so it can’t perseverate on silly things, messing up your speaking voice because of the conflict with the unconscious.

There are many ways to give the internal voice the complexity it needs, but it requires a completely different set of ideas which most people, honestly, spend almost no time considering in their lives.

Because your internal and external voices are not in sync with one another; they are not both working as one in the moment. I realized this many years ago, in my early forties and when I learned how to keep them in sync, the change was amazing. Let me explain.

We are all aware of the voice in our head that generally is running like a background announcer constantly talking to us about various and mostly irrelevant things. Here’s an example of what that voice in our head might be doing at a given moment. Imagine a guy walks into a coffee shop (this isn’t the beginning of a joke):

“Hmmm. It is cold in this coffee shop. Why can’t they ever get the temperature right in here. I guess it is always a day behind the temperature outside. Oh, Cassie is working today. She is cute, and damn, I forgot to shave. Two people in line ahead of me. That means it will be my turn in a second. I want a mocha and a muffin. Let me practice saying my order in my head so I don’t look like an idiot when I order. Hmm…she changed her hair color again. I liked it better before I think. How are other people so smooth when they order...why am I so tense. Ok. Practice…“I want a mocha and a muffin.” Wait, do I want a muffin… Maybe oatmeal would be healthier. Hmm…great, now there is an attractive woman behind me and she is going to hear me sound like an idiot when I order. Oh, what size mocha do I want…fuck, it’s my turn… “I’ll have a mocha coffee, small, I mean tall, and a oatmeal muffin….” - Damn it. I’m such an idiot.

Now, what happens if we just turn off the thought stream happening in our head, refuse to rehearse at all, until it is actually time to order. “Hey Cassie. I’ll have a tall mocha and a pumpkin cream cheese muffin. Thanks.” I mean, how hard is it to just say that. Why would I ever need to rehearse at all…

That voice in our head is mostly the bane of our existence. It has a good and important purpose, but almost none of us use it for that purpose. We let it run amok and so it creates a host of problems for us in our day-to-day conversations, and truly in our lives.

Pay attention to your stress levels and you will find that when that voice is going on in the fashion noted above, it physically jacks up your blood pressure. A simple experiment is to walk or run on a treadmill that is monitoring your heart rate, usually through the handles. As you warm up, grab the handles to check your heart rate in your “normal” state of functioning (meaning with your mind wandering in its usual way). Then, turn off the thought stream. (Easier said than done, but try.) Generally, this will result in a kind of heavy feeling in the top middle portion of your brain - you can actually feel it when you learn to pay close attention. If you can achieve that feeling, your heart rate will begin to drop, often as much as ten to fifteen beats, just by turning off the thought stream running amok.

The question, of course, is how do we keep that thought stream from running amok. In a sense, meditation is about turning off that voice in our heads, but I think meditation misses the mark. Meditating is a bit like trying to balance on the head of a pin, and it throws the baby out with the bathwater. Remember, that internal voice does have a purpose. The voice in my head is very helpful to me, so long as I stay in the moment, either speaking without rehearsing, or thinking about things the unconscious mind is driving me to consider. However, if you haven’t paid much attention to the unconscious you might not know what it is trying to do for us, so you will have to learn this first.

But here are a few hints. Boredom doesn’t exist merely to annoy us. Boredom is your unconscious telling you it is intellectually hungry and you need to give it something deep to ponder. Curiosity, which is closely aligned with boredom, is your unconscious telling you what intellectual things you will find interesting and rewarding if you look deeper, if you spend more time with it.

However, there are lots of things the unconscious doesn’t care about, so if you do these instead, you will feel stress, not relaxation. The unconscious does not give a rat’s about the attractive girl behind you in line at the coffee shop, or how I sound when I make my order at a coffee shop. It wants to think about more interesting and complex things, not have us wasting time on silly stuff. For me, what is interesting is how the mind works, or physics, the nature of morality, or a play that I am interested in writing. Last night, when I ran on the treadmill at my gym, I spent the entire time thinking about a screenplay I want to write that is a sequel to the movie - Good Will Hunting - an idea that I have had for a long time. So I was thinking about the opening scene, the general plot lines, the characters, etc., all while I was running. I hardly noticed that I was running and so I was able to run longer and with less effort than usual.

Sometimes, I will sing when I run, which helps eliminate that noisy voice by focusing it on something relatively creative, and even better if I am making up lyrics as I run rather than trying to remember a song. My last workout I literally made up lyrics for over 35 minutes while I was running - in other words, I was constantly thinking in the moment and creatively. I was not thinking about what I had to do next, after I was done with my workout. I was not thinking about the pain I was in while running and how many more minutes I had to run. I was not thinking about what I had to do the next day or what I had done earlier in the day. I wasn’t replaying whatever silly thing I might have done or said that made me look foolish to someone. I was in the moment and I was relaxed.

When talking with others, we often have the thoughts we would actually say, if we were not concerned with what the person might think, and then we have another line of thought trying to gauge the person’s (or persons’) reactions, or potential reactions, and whether the social situation makes it appropriate for us to say what we really think or whether this will piss off our friend, boss, significant others, etc. So as we try to speak, we are trying to change our verbal expression to match the social appropriateness of the situation, which puts our conscious desires in conflict with what would naturally come out if we just let ourselves speak.

Often, we choose not speak at all because we are unsure whether we should, then we become frustrated at ourselves that we didn’t speak. The next time we might well react to our frustration by forcibly blurting out something. This might well be inappropriate because it was also forced, and less about our accurate thoughts, experienced in the moment, than about our prior frustration with ourselves over not speaking previously. So, we end up sounding angry, despite trying to be expressive due to the frustration from the prior inhibition. This is part of the learning process, and it highlights why we sometime experience a stumbling way of speaking.

My suggestion is you try some little experiments in your life. In situations that you know will not get you into much trouble, speak your mind without any rehearsing or filtering. Really, don’t rehearse - turn that shit off - just speak your thoughts out loud as they come to you; let the river flow. Also, don’t fear silence, particularly when you are with someone new. Often, that voice will pop up in these moments of silence and off it runs like a horse scared by a gunshot. Silence is find; let it be. You can start by doing this when you order things at restaurants or coffee shops. Hopefully, you can also do it with a friend or significant other. You might want to tell them what you are working on, so they know why you are being a little different than usual - and you will be different when you stop monitoring yourself.

What I have found, invariably, is that I am much more relaxed, interesting, and even funny, when I just let my thought stream come out as my voice without any filter or rehearsing. There is none of the tongue-tied stuff when your conscious mind and unconscious mind are not conflicted. But depending on how much you have been holding back, initially, there will be a kind of forced element to it until you learn to really speak what you are thinking without filtering/rehearsing it, without practicing first in your head, without putting on a persona when you speak...

My wife and I are now spending more time in the US (east coast) and she bought me a motorcycle as a present this summer (I know, she’s a keeper…) 

I’ve only done about a thousand miles on it in the last few months, but I am just not enjoying riding in the US at all. I’m getting really frustrated, because motorcycling was always my ‘me’ time, and an opportunity to escape the phone and the email, and maybe run an errand or get a coffee. I love the sense of freedom, and the greater interaction with my environment.

I’ve recently had the very sad realisation that I genuinely dislike riding in the US. Back in the UK there are advertisements on TV promoting bike safety, and the society generally acknowledges that bikers are much more vulnerable than car drivers, and therefore need to be given a little extra room and consideration. 

But the US is a totally different animal. The inability to filter (in my state) leaves you exposed to being rear ended. Vehicles follow so close you wonder if they are actually trying to run you over. When people see you are trying to change lanes, they close gap solely stop you ‘getting ahead’ as if we are all in the same queue - when it clearly makes no difference at all - but even worse as a biker if you don’t catch the (often very late) lunge to cut you off you can be seriously exposed to danger. 

Just yesterday I had a car driver leaning on the horn because I didn’t want to move forward into a junction until I could see the gap in oncoming traffic to make the left turn - something that seems to be obvious to me, but somehow no one seems to understand natural mitigation steps bikers should be taking. 

And all this is before we factor in the complete addiction to cell phones whilst driving, total lack of roadcraft, lane discipline, and freeway speed following distances that make me genuinely concerned (even when I’m in the car).

To be clear, there is a lot to love about the US. But I have always loved motorcycling - it has always been part of who I am - and I am at a loss as to how I can enjoy it here. 

This is a genuine appeal for advice. Has anyone been through the same transition? Do I need to ride differently? Currently seriously considering selling the bike, so hope I can get some help here. Any tips appreciated. ",99,1733604246.0,motorcycles,95,0.94,False

I used to live in Indiana, and now live in chicago. And I just so fustrated and tired of not really interacting with anyone in person than my doctors and my dog and my dad. I just been having a low mood it doesnt help I had a break up with a guy I dated for 3 years.

I am really craving spending social time and its hard since I moved in my dads back in august due to health reason since I needed physical therapy, I was not able to find a job that pay me enough to live in a studio by myself. My health condition got really point to I was not able to work ( I fell and hurt a disc). So much of my daily life is me spending time to myself. Me going to my doctor appointments, applying to jobs, taking care of my family pets, cooking for my dad, I do grocery shopping for my dad, and I help with projects around the home since my dad also moved here so he asked for help like builidng the dresser or something and ect. As much I am grateful for the rent free and him paying for my doctor treatment.

I just miss any social interactions or having a converstaion non related to my health. I do other things such as webinars about continuing education meeting for psychology since I am thinking of going to graduate school. Or I meet with people from the graduate school to talk about the program. WHich is good since it be harder if I had a job.

I tried reaching out to my friend who live near me who moved to the city to work here. THe issue comes often scheduling issues. SInce my friends do have jobs they just super busy. I do have hobbies but they all individual me being a lone since when I was at school I spend so much time with others like classes, work, my hobbies which is watching TV, knitting and painting and cooking would give me energy since I used to spend so much time with other socially or work related.

Now I just hate my hobbies. Like even going to the gym walking my dog, since its another taste being by myself.

I do some virtual work I am helping an nonprofit as a volunteer to create media for them. I just dread doing my hobbies or cleaning. Since I feel my daily thing is just being inside all the time. I know this sounds pathetic I just miss getting coffee with my friends. I miss talking about TV shows with someone.

I starting to hate listening to my music, or TV or doing the chores that I do. I sadly unfortuately look forward to my Therapy appointments or my physical therapy appointment since its the few times a week I can talk to someone.

1h91rk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h91rk4/aitah_for_not_helping_a_friend_during_a_medical/,"AITAH for not helping a friend during a ""medical emergency"""," Throwaway, I(30F) have a close group of 5 friends that was developed in college including my husband(32M). The group consists of 2 couples, and one single friend. We all live within 2 hours of each other and make an effort to see each other often. Ben(30M), our single friend has been dating Shelby(29F) for about a year and half and recently proposed. Shelby has never meshed with our group fully. She differs in opinion about politics, religion, food preferences, activities. Pretty much anything our group agrees on as a group, she disagrees with on. Its also not just that disagrees, she very disrespectfully disagrees. Our group enjoys engaging in debates and having conversions about topics we have different opinions on, but at the end of it we leave respecting each others views and not trying to change who they are. Shelby however is very very abrasive if you disagree about anything with her and it makes it hard to have a conversation with her. 

Recently Shelby has become very open about her struggle with depression and anxiety. She talks about it so frequently that sometimes it feels like she uses it as a weapon to get her way at opportune moments. She brings it up when we are doing activities she doesn't enjoy and insists Ben take her home, she says they have to go home early and can't meet us out at the bar because she got depressed all of sudden and Ben has to take her home, but whenever we are doing things she suggested she never has an issue.

So the issue arose we were all at a restaurant during a recent get together and they had a drink that we all enjoyed a lot at this old dive bar we frequented in college. The conversation turned to that bar and we tried to include her in conversation by explaining the bar, the drink, asking if she had a old haunt like that in college, etc. She proclaimed the bartender must have added an extra shot to her drink because she is feeling anxious and needs to leave. She also made sure to add it was probably added because of her nice ass. Ben suggested we go to a coffee shop so we could continue hanging out, she insisted they leave. Ben said ok, let me finish my drink and we can go. She all of sudden shot up out of her chair in tears and walked outside. We all looked around at each other and I asked Ben if she was ok, he said instead of asking to just go home when she doesn't want to be out anymore sometimes she has been blaming it on anxiety. I didn't say anything but it confirmed the thoughts I had had that maybe she had been milking it a bit. My other friend(30F) and I went outside to check on her and found her crying. We asked if she was ok, and she said she was having a panic attack and needed to be taken to the hospital. I would like to point out that I am a nurse and understand what a panic attack is and I did not believe she was having one. Her heart rate was not elevated(I checked it), she was not flushed or short of breath, or had chest pain. I had her sit down and told her that I thought she was having possibly an anxiety attack not a panic attack. She turned on me and yelled that how the hell would I know, she knows herself, if she said she is then she is and started yelling for Ben. He came running out and she screamed she was having a panic attack and needed to be taken to the ER. He looked at me and asked if she was ok, she screamed that I was ignoring her because I hated her and was not helping her and ran to the car. Ben followed and they drove off. He called a bit later and said the hospital said she was fine and it was maybe just an anxiety attack. He was upset and asked why I hadn't just come and gotten him as Shelby was really upset. I said that I knew she wasn't having a panic attack and he had just told us she sometimes does this for attention. He said she was really upset and doesn't want to hang out with us at all now. Our group is split, my other friend who was there said I handled it appropriately and its her insecurities that she has to get over. We have been nothing but kind to her and she constantly bullies us and is demeaning in how she speaks to us. The guys all think I should have just helped because she was clearly upset and needed help. I guess it wouldn't have hurt anything to help more but I'm a bit tired of getting pushed around by her. AITAH for not just helping even though I knew she was fine?

TLDR: Friends very insecure fiancé had a possible anxiety attack and claimed it was a panic attack. I'm a nurse and know it wasn't a panic attack and she claimed I'm an asshole for not helping with her medical emergency.

 Okay, can someone please help me understand this? so... We are invited to a birthday party from my son's daycare. And I RSVP'd and we went to the birthday party. (We are Indians) we got there and I think its the grandparents' house. And when we go there, they(parents) are greeting everybody who came, and they did not even say hi to us. They just did not even look in the eye they were just looking at my son and saying, good morning. And my son went and greeted their kid, happy birthday. And then the birthday boy's father just told, oh, say thank you. And then that's all. 

The hosts were talking to other parents who are all Americans( White, by the way). And she's even giving hugs to some of them. I understand maybe they are close friends or, you know, they got closer in the daycare journey and all of that. But she did greet a lot of people who came. Just warm, nice, hi, how are you? Thanks for coming and all of that. And they both did not speak a word to me and my husband. 
We were there for almost two hours. She was asking people to go have some coffee and help themselves with some snacks etc. She did not greet my kid, say something to my kid or ask us to have coffee or, anything she was asking other parents. Maybe not all o f them, but I was standing right there.

 She was going and making some conversations with, you know, the other parents. But even though I was just standing there and I was invited to her party with the kid, of course. They just did not speak anything to us. It was very awkward. Like, if you don't want or, you know, if you're not feeling very comfortable. Why even invite? So there are two more Indians in the class. Maybe they invited everybody, but they did not show up. we have been to another birthday party (white) a month before and it's almost the same case. That host also did not greet us or anything, but it was not in their house. They just had it at some play center. And she said, hi, that's all. They were not like talking to other people and not to us. So it did not feel that awkward. It just felt maybe, okay, it's not how they do it. 

But this, they had this at their grandparents' house. And their grandparents are even more I mean, even when you look at them and smile, they're not even smiling back. I don't know. So I'm just like I mean, we're all millennials, you know, around the same age group with same age group kids. And, you know, the kids get along really well. I really don't know why would someone behave that way? Especially she's nice and warm with other white people. 

There are a few other kids' parents they are nice. There are a few other moms who just came to me, introduced some of them. And some of them whom I met before just said hi. They were talking like a casual conversation. And I was surprised to see that the host did not do that.. I mean, doesn't hurt to look in the eye and say hi, right? And the reason for asking this is, next time when I get invite from, Americans do I go, not go? It was purely in the interest of my son. And he's excited to go to his friend's birthday party. And we took him. And somehow it did not make us feel comfortable at all. 

My husband says, you just have to ignore all of this and just go for him so that he can enjoy the birthday party. I agree. But I'm just worried that, you know, as he grows bigger, he might feel the same thing that he's not purely welcomed. If this is the way the parents behave, I'm just trying to understand what might be going on. Or like, you now, if any of you can feel or understand from their side, like, what is the problem? It's not like they're not behaving properly or something. It's just they're talking to everybody else, but not us.",1,1733604161.0,toddlers,3,0.67,False

Any kind of bag/container can't be left out because she’ll punch through it with her snout. I don't let her wander around without direct supervision because she always finds something to get into. 

Are all pigs like this? My friend has several house pigs and they seem less destructive. I've tried to train some of this behavior out of her but she is SO STUBBORN training is always a long process. She's five, I've hard her since she was like 8 weeks old, and she's still learning.

Hey guys, this is my first post on Reddit, sorry if it’s not great.

I would really appreciate some guidance on my migrating objectives.

First of all I’m 26, male, Mexican born and raised, with one degree in law and another one in accounting/administration. I speak Spanish and English fluently, and French you could say a level B2. 

As for my experience, I practiced tax law for 3 years in Mexico, as well as assisting the firm’s administration (because of my academic background) and 2 years of barista/bartender/manager of an intimate specialty coffee shop/restaurant/cocktail bar in Montréal. I also have some background in Human Resources and construction as well as other stuff, but they were only small jobs, nothing too crazy.
In general terms, I would like to know where are my best chances and paths in Europe (which country, what to study, what industry to find work in, or other), firstly on getting there, and also economically and for the chance of aspiring for a permanent status, and maybe some tips and suggestions on where to find more in depth info (programs, government, immigration firms, agencies, organizations, corporations, forums, etc).
I listed a couple of countries in the title in order to comply with the format, but any other alternatives in Europe are welcome.
The economy is not great in Mexico (even for my somewhat decent background) and it’s not necessary to say how it’s become more and more dangerous/deadly (at least my home state), as well as the politicians just surpassing themselves in how bad they can be, for me to consider having my life and future assets safe in here.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",1,1733603953.0,SubjectivePhysics,0,1.0,False

Here’s my thoughts and feel free to AMA! ,"First of all, it’s beautiful. We stayed in the F&F Sundeck Suite with our family of 4. Kids 12 and 17. It was perfect. The deck was EVERYTHING! We loved spending time on it. Watching the sunrise every morning with our coffee was a highlight. 

We ordered a ton of room service, my kids thought it was awesome it was 24 hours. Highly recommend the vegan ceviche and churros 🤤  it always came quicker than expected and perfectly hot or cold. 

Mini fridge was fully stocked with water, Gatorade, soda, chocolate milk and beer. 

The hotel was definitely still working on stuff, but nothing that got in the way of our vacation or was disruptive. It’s mostly the top floor suites that were getting the work done I believe. 

The first floor has all the bars, restaurants, shops and extra amenities. My kids did bowling and the race cars. It was maybe $10/20 bucks for each for those. They also had lazer tag, priced about the same. There was always some deal tho for those activities, like pay for 3 bowlers get the 4th free. I did not find it unreasonable, but also I went there knowing I would be paying extra for those. 

We ate at Copal. Black Iron, Veranda, Livo and Kita. 

Black Iron and Livo were phenomenal. With Livo being out absolute favorite. 

But, eveything was very good. My son has a nut allergy and they went above and beyond to take caution for him. Even when ordering room service. I was impressed honestly. 

At the pools/bay you order from your waiter using a QR code. And it was honestly some of the best poolside food I’ve had an AI. Highly recommend the sliders, wings and ceviche! 

The Bay is…nice but boring. I would say that my biggest complaint about this trip is that the water obstacle course wasn’t open the whole time and you can’t even swim in the deep part of the bay bc they just use it for kayaking and paddle boarding. We spend all our time at the family pool and it was lively! It did get kinda crowded as the afternoon went on but that’s to be expected. The south end of the property has an awesome adults only pool area. We weren’t able to spend time there as we were with our kids but I wish we could have. 

The beach is coming along beautifully! We loved walking the length of it every day. It was red flags the whole time so no ocean swimming but that’s not our jam anyways so no loss there. (Others ignored the flags and were swimming so it’s not enforced I don’t think) They work diligently to keep it clear tho, and it wasn’t seaweed ridden or gross in the least bit. 

Can’t really speak to the nightlife bc we spend our night after dinner on our deck. 

We did get messages and they were also wonderful. We had Blanca and Adela and they were so respectful and professional and I was definitely sad I didn’t get the 80 minute treatment! The spa is massive, it’s gorgeous and relaxing. My husband and son also loved the gym. Tons of equipment. 

All in all, we loved it. We will return simply for the proximity to the airport. Took us ten minutes once we got our transportation. And we didn’t need to leave the resort hours and hours before our flight home either bc it was so close. 

I wouldn’t let any of the earlier reviews deter anyone, they are finding their footing and this place is great. Let me know if I can answer any questions!

Hello everyone! 

I need a little but of help here interpreting this person. 

I'm a girl in her later twenties in college and theres this guy I fancy but he seems to be an introvert. At social gatherings he's always on the edge of the people circle and I rarely see him approach people/ be very loud or outgoing. 


For the past six months we've had this back and forth where we slowly kind of... talked to each other? 


Until now it's like this:

Gone out for a 1:1 coffee (albeit short because his schedule is packed) 

He's offered to help me with my thesis and chat about a topic of common interest 

He kinda blushed? And stopped to smalltalk with me, when he saw me in the hallway after I had attended a non mandatory project from his faculty 

He's said hello to me at parties even when I was just passing by and he was engaged with other people. 

I noticed him looking at me as I exit or enter shared spaces... 


The issue is he's not really... asked to do stuff one on one or come forwards to be like: hey wanna go for a walk or coffee again? 

Idk if he's interested or stringing me along or if I'm just misinterpreting his kindness... :') 

Idk if I should just make a move and if how? 
By telling him I have a crush or just keep engaging with him...

1h91l33,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h91l33/1175_boss_baby/,[1175] Boss Baby,"Oh, shit! You ready? I haven’t written in almost 3 weeks. In that time I’ve started a new job, gotten sick, my car shit the bed, I experienced what felt like a Craigslist “missed connection” at a comedy show in Chicago (Phil Hanley late Saturday show if you’re reading this, Sam!), and have already begun plotting on how to morph my new job role into something that isn’t tantamount to babysitting+.

Let’s start local. I got pink eye. I don’t think I’ve had pink eye since I was 4 years old. I’m a site director now for the YMCA. I’m around, by definition dirty, kids and the things they touch for at least 5 1/2 hours a day. No matter how much wood I’ve knocked in recalling how infrequently I get sick, they got me. This happened at the tail end of getting over a mild cold that decided to get worse just as I thought I had efficiently beat it. I wear contacts and don’t have backup glasses. My eye’s aren’t terrible, but driving has been *extra*.

While sick, I’m getting a handle on the true nature of my role and responsibilities. As with most organizations, they have a “mission” and “ethos” and “goals” which are on thousands of pages of wasted paper and policy, but no less inform how some of the most true-believers operate. I’m at a poorer school that no less has figured out how to raise enough funds to consistently engage its kids. I’ve found some people to click with, and found some people who it’s clearly not in their nature to click. Underneath that is the fundamental problem all companies seem to have with basic demonstrations of competence and communication.

I can’t pretend that my job is that complicated, especially given my experience just in my hobbies, let alone at DCS or in counseling. I try not to say it in a condescending way, but I have said it dozens of ways, that I’m a glorified babysitter. At least, that’s how the role was translating my first few days when it sunk in that the difference between a YMCA program and an actual daycare is, drum roll, the programming of activities. If you don’t have anyone concerned with implementing and consistently executing programs, you’re just babysitting. Hence, in spite of 9 people currently hired to oversee 30-ish kids at my site, they hired me to, you know, actually direct something.

At first, naive me was asking things like, “Why can’t the 9 adults do what I’m told needs to be done here?” Several more days of watching people respond to my questions with deer-in-the-headlights faces and pensive toe digs while trying to explain how they’re getting paid to essentially hang out, I got my answer. Also, everyone before me is to blame, as well as the broader chaos of the YMCA leadership.

I’ve done that thing where I have immediately found common ground with the most adult and introspective person and we’ve had quasi-therapy sessions in the mornings about how things are ran or what informs our perspectives. She will be vital in helping me get on committees and pushing reforms that hopefully flesh out that identity and values the YMCA professes. The takeaway is the same as elsewhere, you need to be the adult.

I’ve got some experience with children, but I’ve never been interested in raising them, am bored to tears after too much of doing whatever it is they want to do, and am generally ambivalent about people which informs how I engage with them professionally. A key thing about this is that I don’t seek to control or dominate. I don’t yell at kids. I don’t condescend. I, viscerally, remember what it was to be a child, and actively attempt to mitigate unconscious cultural norms that aren’t helpful in cultivating what you want.

Thus, I have to be the adult for both the kids and the adults I’m now responsible for directing who might feel licensed to get loud and lecture-y and disingenuous in their approach to a kindergartner. For me, who does not profess to be an expert in child-rearing, but who is informed by his experiences, developmental science, and in watching how others operate, I maintain a certain degree of confidence my kids will figure out how to operate along more structured and accountable lines. I’ll suggest something like, don’t reward and entertain the kid who is being performative in their crying. I’m pliable, but keep a decently strong opinion about the efficacy of certain types of intervention, for what age, and under what circumstances.

Some people deeply appreciate this approach, others get petty, aggrieved, and gossipy. You will, under every circumstances, become “the enemy” in one form or another by virtue of any whiff of change altogether, but more accountable change in particular. That’s baked into any leadership role. To me, this means even more not to try to be a dictator more than demonstrator. I speak to the kids like I want you to speak to them. I credit them when they do something right. I trade in time, so when they waste ours, they get theirs wasted while they’re itching for the gym or playground. It’s literally only been 3 days of mild implementation of “my” way, and I’m already seeing positive results.

It’s hard for me to not think about what my day-to-day looks like at scale. We’re now tasked with hoping and praying our way through the next Trump catastrophe, but that’s only to frame it as though we aren’t the fuck ups. That’s to again distance ourselves from our impact and ignorance and hate that dictates the ship. I’ve no less been listening to all my podcasts and reading about how people attempt to digest the zeitgeist. I can’t recommend enough listening to someone like Anthony Scaramucci and then the 5 vs 4 crowd back-to-back. Or the guests of Michael Moynihan and Bari Weiss and then up-in-arms Leftist academics on Michael Shermer. The nature of wanting/needing a story to supplement or replace personal responsibility beams brightly.

I don’t think there’s a room with or interaction between any two people that exists where there isn’t both an obligation and potential. The obligation would be to something like an imagined universal human value. You treat people a certain way or expect something even as simple as holding the door open for all of space and time. The potential is for that interaction to be dictated or mitigated by personal folly and ambivalence. “It is what it is” as though you have no conscious choice. As though “reason” doesn’t exist or isn’t defined by how it’s executed in good or bad ways.

Monday this week, at 4:45 AM when I tried to leave for work, I discovered my tire was flat. I live in the countriest of country. It’s pitch black, freezing, and recall, my job isn’t that hard or needing of me to actually be there in order for the kids to be kept basically safe and supervised. It’s already extremely wasteful the hour drive I make there and back every day. I’ve been sick. I’ve got the excuse to stay home and sleep in playing out brilliantly. My truck is at my friend’s house. I’m not sure if the new-old car has the equipment to change the tire, further complicated by being on a gravel driveway. I could have left it at that.

I informed my boss of what happened. I sat briefly with my coffee, and proceeded to get to work navigating the problem. The tire wasn’t just flat, but the car I’m driving is very old and 2 windows are taped to try and hold them up. The tape failed, so the car froze on the inside too. Gotta get that fixed. After 3 hand-cranked failed attempts to get the jack to balance, I get the boot on. I drive straight to a tire shop up the road from my job. It takes hours, I overdraft my account paying more for needed tires than the car cost, and navigate from the lobby trying to get money from an account I almost never use, forgetting the pin. In the waiting hours, I cross the highway to mail a package, get food, and make some other errand calls. I was at work for the after school shift.

That night, a flash frozen rain descended upon the area. Parents were over an hour late to pick up kids. Wrecks blocked traffic. I’m perpetually tired the last 3 weeks adjusting to my schedule, sick, and am trying not to ruminate on the irony of being more in debt after getting a job and in needing to get there than by just being broke and at home. I’m staring down the hour and a half minimum drive. I, too, have to navigate remote country roads at 5 mph so I don’t end up like the SUV I stopped for just before I reached home. A “let’s drag this day out even more” cherry on top.

This is either a story of one massive bitch-fest meant to draw sympathy or a basic story of adult accountability employing the tools and skills of perspective and resilience to meet obligations. Some people will view it defensively and try to engage in a pissing match about who has it worse. Some will be ambivalent because...yeah it’s just life and we all get flat tires and deal with the cold. It’s vitally important to me that we all understand most the moments of inflection and choice. I could have sat out the entire day, blamed circumstances, and lied about my ability to address any part of it. I think that’s precisely what we’re doing at less viscerally obvious moments every single day.

You are accountable to you first or you cannot claim to be accountable for anyone else. I would not deserve a leadership position if I were the type of person to pretend I don’t know how to begrudgingly change a tire in the dark, freezing, and on my gravel driveway. I do, I did, and I’m sure I’ll have to do it again some day. I’m sick, so even if it’s more debt and I can’t “really” afford it, I have my medicated $150 eye drops and Urgent Care bill, and began reflexively disinfecting everything I touched at work. I need to continue to watch myself not being an excuse-ridden piece of shit in the world in spite of my very real, very reasonably felt grievances for things I suffer each day.

I unironically bring up unionizing in every job I take. I get zero enthusiasm, feedback, or curiosity about it. Everyone is keen to complain about the pay, disorganization, conflicting feedback, etc., no one, ever, will even entertain the conversation about how to do it better. They also know that, on balance, they’re probably getting away with a certain kind of murder in how they’re making their money or conducting their role. A union is an attempt at a more formal accountability. We, as a species, instinctively and reflexively do not want that.

Don’t be a screaming ape or in denial about your inner insecure kindergartner. We live and die by what we are bringing into or seek to take away from how we engage with one another. I want patience. I want beat by beat reasoned understanding and reflection. I want an earnest investment towards positive changes and values that aren’t empty abstracted truisms eking out of ambivalent cliches masquerading as adults and leaders. Getting by or through each day on some egocentric story of your rights, victimization, or entitlements is not the same thing as demonstrating your understanding and embodiment of your value system. You might profess to be the boss of your own life, but you should be acting as a avatar of what the best version of that life could look like.",2,1733603686.0,self,0,1.0,False

Our first date was technically just a walk around a park, and we got coffee after which we paid on our own. 

The second date, two weeks later, he invited me to try his favorite restaurant which is about a 45-minute drive away from my place, but only a short (10-minute) Uber ride from his. I was under the impression that it would be his treat this time since the place is a bit upscale, it was his pick, and he knew it was a bit far from where I lived. I was a bit flustered when he immediately told the server to split the check at the end of the date, and I had to pay for a meal that was out of my budget range. I know it was my fault for not clarifying this with him beforehand, but it definitely ended the day on a bad note. 

The third “date” happened because during the second date, before the check incident happened, I mentioned I will have an event near where he lived in two weeks. He asked if I will be down to meet up afterwards, which I agreed to. Two days before the day, he texted me asking if I was still interested to hang out. I agreed, since I wanted to wait out the rush hour anyway after my event. So on the day, we had coffee and some snacks. I excused myself to head to the restroom and when I came back, the server was already handing out two checks. He asked to split the bill when I was in the washroom.

For a bit more context: The local custom where I am from is that men pay for the first few dates, or at least offer to pay and allow the lady to offer to pay for her share. But, I’m a local, and this guy is an American living and working here. He earns considerably more than I do, and he is well aware of it. Lastly, the conversations have been going well and we’re genuinely connecting. He wants to continue going on dates and getting to know each other—he even asked when I’ll be free again for a fourth date but I haven’t responded yet, at least not until I sort these concerns first.

I’m just not sure if there’s anything lost in translation here, or something I’m just not picking up, but I do feel it has been quite off. Is this something I should communicate to him early on? I would appreciate thoughts.",1,1733603399.0,dating_advice,11,0.56,False

I had a question. So, I'm 24F and I got my BA in Psychology in January of this year. I was referred by my mother to send my resume and interview at the company where she works as a HHA. She has been begging me to do this, as the jobs I've worked up until this point were menial/labor jobs, which I'm comfortable with, but she believes I need to ""move up in the world now"" and get a big girl job that I can put my degree to use in. 

However, my deep worry is that while I have intellectual UNDERSTANDINGS of psychology, and I am compassionate with people who fall under categories such as BPD, recovering addict, schizo-affective, etc (these are some of the groups I'd be assisting I was told), I truly have little to no experience with how to deal with these affected people. I interned at a hospital in NYC when I was 17, and the most patient interaction I had was running to heat up their coffee and whatnot. And when it came time for me to deal with individuals who were having meltdowns, exhibiting symptoms of their disorders, etc, I would always need someone to intervene because I just wasn't going about it the right way. I have never abused anyone or anything of that nature, I would just say the wrong things. Or always need little corrections. I lack a lot of confidence in my ability to help these affected people in the way they need. It pains me to no end, and makes me have anxiety breakdowns like once a day. Learning about BPD is one thing, but putting this into practice is very different. It makes me so sad, I could cry. And often do.

I know it is a learning curve, and I'll have a great staff to support me along the way (the company is on their P's & Q's, and they love my mother so they vowed to help me as much as I need), but I would love if someone who is also a Case Manager or has experience in the social work field can give me some advice on how to navigate, or a dose of reality (without being too harsh 😭💀). I just don't believe in myself to do this, quite frankly. It's hard for me to even help myself emotionally sometimes, and I have reason to believe that I may be on the Autism spectrum and am planning on asking my PCP if I could be referred to take the exam. And see a therapist. 

So, in summary, I'm shortly going to be working as a per diem Case Manager and I worry I don't have the experience to help. I haven't worked so closely with people like this in this field at all, although that's what I went to school for, and I question if I even want to deal with this stress. Or if I could ever be ready.

What do you think? Thank you.

Like a good hunter, I kept my distance. After all, a hunter never lets its prey know that we’re close. 

I watched you walk, smiling and giggling as you get closer to home. I kept a close distance. I could smell your perfume. I could find you in a sea of thousands.  

“What’s this? You’re taking a new side street? Alone?” Grinning from ear to ear. You are MINE for the taking. I walk faster, inching closer and closer to you. Closing the gap between us. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up. You notice my figure behind you. You speed up your pace. 

You will not get away. You are mine!I growl, as I use my body to push you. You gasp, as your chest hits the wall. I dig my nails into your back. You let out this deep moan. You whimper, “fuck” as your head falls back. My teeth embed into your neck; marking my prey. Your body quivers as I bite deeper into your skin. 

I grab your waist and toss you around to face me. Our eyes meet. Here’s your chance! You slap me, you scratch me. I smirk as you fight me. I grab a hold of your hands and force them above your head. I push my face against yours biting your cheek. You scream as my teeth sink into your cheek. 

I slide my hand under your skirt and tear off your panties. I rub your lips, feeling all your wetness. I push my fingers into your wet pussy. I finger fuck you, shoving you against the wall.

Your breathing becomes panting; primal. You’re ready.

I unbuckle my pants and let them fall to the ground.  Grabbing you under your thighs, I lift you against the wall. I thrust my strap inside you. Ravaging you; without mercy. Your nails tear into my shirt. I can feel your nails digging deeper into my skin, gripping me.

You groan louder as your body bounces up and down, ensuring to get every inch of my strap. The scratches on my face and neck burn as we swap sweat. How you fought me, only to be subdued. To be taken. To be owned.

You moan louder. Grabbing my neck. Grunting in your ear, “You’re getting close aren’t you?”  I bear hug you and thrust my hips harder, faster. Sending you into complete ecstasy. You grab my face and bite my lip, only fueling my viciousness. 

“Cum for me”. Gripping my neck tighter, you let out this cry. Your legs clasped tight around me, holding me in tight as you cum all over my strap and thighs. Your body shaking, your nails dug into my neck and throat. You take a deep sigh of relief.

Ok so coffee on planes is usually: Meh. Sometimes the FA will note that they're a coffee drinker and so just made a fresh pot, in which case it's ""ok"". I think perhaps in D1 one time recently there was some sort of French press type thing going on which was nice, but too strong. Same experience for 30 years...

Until this week. I flew coach Delta (credit card free companion ticket), two segments. Actually probably operated by Sky West. Coffee was fantastic. Really good. Smooth, rich, not bitter, just amazing. Both flights.

Was this a crazy fluke, or did someone in the Delta illuminati get the idea to start making decent coffee on flights?

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",2,1733602425.0,EBEs,0,1.0,False

I know most people would say, suck it up and do it, but I never see people telling the mother that. 

Here's the thing. Pee diapers? Throw up? I'll do every time. My wife gets frustrated because I cannot get through the poopy diapers. I have a bad gag reflex. I can't even get dental X-rays done in a timely manner. I've tried this coffee nose things, vaporub, masks, blankets, etc. I've had this gag reflex to bad smells my entire life. I've been told my entire life to just ""suck it up"", but I literally cannot. Even to the point of talking to my doctor about it, and nothing. 

I change 100 percent of the pee diapers when baby is with me. If I were alone with baby, I fight through and change the diaper, but it normally results in extended clean ups.
