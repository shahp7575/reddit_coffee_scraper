Hi everyone,
I recently moved to Bhubaneswar for work and honestly feeling quite lonely. I don’t really have friends here yet, and after work and on weekends it gets really boring.

I’m a working male, fairly introverted, and looking for genuine connections — even casual coffee, walks, or just conversations. Open to meeting people around or joining hobby / activity groups.

If anyone has suggestions for safe communities, meetups, or just wants to chat, please let me know.
Thanks for reading 🤍",2,1765742962.0,Bhubaneswar,1,1.0,False

Day 4

It was an early wake-up. It was an overcast day, or looking as if it were doomed to be one in any case. I trudged through my morning routine on autopilot until I found myself at the dining table getting ready to pour myself some cereal.  
  
Uncle Logan entered and said, “You don’t need to make yourself breakfast. We’ll be having it there.”  
  
I smirked and said, “Ah, we’re all going to be drinking the Kool-Aid together? Or do I get to be the one who stays behind to keep up the website?” I laughed at my own joke hoping for some levity.   
  
Uncle Logan smiled, but not in a way I could quite read. “No, no, nothing like that. Very funny. It’s good to leave early in any case. Since everyone shows up, getting a good parking spot is competitive.”   
  
I shrugged. “Alright. I’ll get Joshua then.”   
  
We were in the truck not long afterward, and pulling into the parking lot before I was convinced Joshua was even properly awake yet. Even though the service wasn’t going to start for a further thirty minutes, the parking lot was nearing full already, and it was clear to me that cars were going to be spilling into the street.   
  
We piled out of the truck and made our way down the path that led to the entrance. The doors were open, and the interior, carpeted in violet, shone greens and blues through the stained glass by the entrance. Far back into the building there was a lectern, raised above the floor so that the priest could see over the congregation. On the lectern was that same symbol I’d been given a charm of, the Immaculate Seal, but with the rest of the Christian cross stretching down below it, the horizontal bar holding up the circle and the winding, ever winding, text. I didn’t like looking at it, but I was already being shuttled in by the crowd forming behind us.   
  
I held Joshua’s hand tightly. He was staring up at the stained glass in wonderment. Only when I followed his gaze did I see the ceiling. It was painted with dozens of figures, robed like the philosophers of Raphael’s \*The School of Athens\*.  
  
The figures closest to the entrance were men and women in pain, hiding their faces with their hands, writhing in patches of grey dirt and surrounded by dead trees. Greek text floated across the ceiling, snaking over ankles and constricting throats, binding wrists and silencing tongues. In the center, in line with the one stained glass panel depicting a human being, was a word written across the ceiling, repeated dozens of times, layered thrice: γνῶσις. On the other side, in a void so distinctly like the violet of a clear midnight’s sky, were those same robed figures, faces now painted to emanate a light which obscured their features, prostrated in kneelings and arms-wide supplications to something beyond the ceiling’s scope.  
  
I wasn’t aware of the fact I was now standing before my place in the pews when Logan pulled on my shoulder for me to sit.   
  
“It’s incredible. But what does it mean?”   
  
Uncle Logan looked up towards the ceiling, his eyes tracing the snaking text across the wall, lashing back and forth. “Knowledge.”  
  
I couldn’t tear my eyes off it. I craned my head around the room until I spotted a figure—or two, actually—tucked into the corner. They were a girl and a little boy. The girl’s hair was light brown, the little boy’s light platinum. She held his hand, shielding him from something past the edge of the fresco.   
  
I looked for them on the other side, explaining a counterpart there. The boy was in the center, his hands clasped together, his eyes painted over by the same white light, his chin upturned towards something beyond. The girl I could not find, save for a feminine hand reaching in from the far edge of the far end of the fresco.   
  
I looked down at Joshua, his blond hair messy, and smoothed it. I shivered.   
  
Others filed in around us, behind us. I didn’t even register the fact that we were in the front row until now. I looked at Logan.  
  
“Why’d you sit us here?”  
  
“So you can see for yourself. And you’re new. It’s good to be visible.”  
  
I found my foot tapping. I knew I was nervous, my gut was screaming at me that something was wrong here and yet it all remained frustratingly deniable. There was nothing to do but wait in the silence, for it was quiet. I expected greetings from those around me, and aside from the wordless nods I received from those few I dared make eye contact with, those who were communicating did so as Logan did—in hushed whispers.  
  
Eventually the thirty minutes elapsed, though they may as well have been as many hours, and the front doors lurched closed. I turned back to see every seat filled. It occurred to me then that as large as the church appeared even from the outside, it was massive here: the whole town’s population, some few hundred, were all gathered here. Even the infants were silent.  
  
Appearing from behind the altar was Father Gallagher, dressed in what were surely his vestments, violet and trimmed with black. Yet more Greek ran up and down the sleeves, across the tabard, surrounding the Immaculate Seal and more symbols I did not recognize.   
  
Gallagher set his hands upon the lectern, and bowed his head. He commenced the prayer I’d heard in class that was then repeated in perfect unison by the congregation: “Creator above, father of wisdom, we thank you for truths revealed and unrevealed, and the sacred knowledge that binds us together. We pray that by your power and with your guidance we might continue to walk the path towards enlightenment, that we may be with you again in your kingdom. Amen.”  
  
He lifted up his chin, and his eyes drifted across the congregation, stopping to rest on us, before he uplifted his hands.  
  
“Brothers and Sisters, there is no finer day than one such as this. So many blessings occur in such a small window of time. Sometimes in the long expanse of time, it takes but the blink of an eye for all things to change. We are blessed first of all by two new members of the congregation that I am overjoyed to see present—Ms. Cecilia Ward, and Mr. Joshua Ward. To those who have not yet met them, I assure you they are the pinnacle of decency. Logan should be proud to call them his blood.”  
  
He nodded towards Logan, who lowered his head.   
  
“In their arrival, we see the oncoming of the next Pneumatikoi. Truly, the future is bright.” His eyes were still on us. I squeezed Joshua’s hand, and he squeezed back, though I could not tear my gaze away from the priest to see whether it was of fear or excitement.  
  
“All our preparation, our prayers, our good works—though difficult in nature and long in planning, all that we have done shall soon pay off. For all the evils in this world, for all the pain and suffering that we have all experienced, the maladies that cruel, pitiless materiality has dealt us, there is an answer. From the work done at home—through the truth that was discovered from those who once called Eleos home, and even from our friend thought lost who has now returned armed with the knowledge of a nation, we will be bound no longer.”   
  
I looked at Logan. I mouthed, “What the hell is he talking about?” but he paid me no attention. I looked back towards the exit. It looked so distant, so unreachable.   
  
“And when the forces of that pitiless materiality come to take enlightenment from us, to steal away that little goodness that we have managed to so carefully hold and sanctify, that we have protected from the hands of those undeserving—”  
  
My eyes watered. Red. I hadn’t been blinking. I felt as if all that was, was in the priest. I did not know, did not understand, did not like what he said, and yet there was nothing else. The walls of the church, lingering in my peripheral vision, flickered away into inky blackness.  The floor under them dropped out from under him, the ceiling flaking away into an abyss so dark that not even the indeterminate shapes one sees while stumbling around in the night, half-lucid, could be picked out within it.  
  
“We have found the truth for ourselves and it will be shared amongst you, ye blessed few. Even as the forces of darkness, the worshippers of the false gifts of materialism and blind bearers of a false cross come towards us as we speak—as they chase the one they think we took from them but who came back to us because she knew the sole thing that mattered—”  
  
I didn’t let him finish. I took Joshua’s hand, and I stood up. I went cold. Blinked.  
  
The church was empty and no light shone through the stained glass. The lit candles hanging across the wall provided my sole illumination. I felt my hand empty.  
  
Joshua was gone. I staggered backwards, eyes dancing wildly. The void that had formed in my peripheral vision had not been content to remain only there. The half of the ceiling beyond the three-layered line of Greek text had fallen away into a sky darker than any night. It was impossible, that section of the ceiling so cleanly cut away from what had just been there, the darkness beyond so thoroughly in defiance of the sun that had not been defeated by the thick cloud cover that had just been. 

Yet even in the absence of light to shine through the stained glass, the interior of this damned place still glowed its rancid greens, blues, and violets.

The lectern was still occupied, but not by Gallagher. The Abbot stood there, wearing vestments inverse of the Father’s: in the blackness of his vestments and the royal purple trim I could only make out his sickly, yellow eyes.  
  
“Where’s Joshua?” I cried. “What the hell is this?”  
  
He smiled, and I wish I could say it was evil, cruel, sadistic. Yet it was plain.  
  
“He is with us. He is a part of the plan. You can be too—you have the luxury of choice.”  
  
“He isn’t with anybody! He is not yours to take!”  
  
“If only you understood your thoughts would be different,” he said. He stepped down from the podium, walking towards me with an open hand like a father coming to comfort a crying child.   
  
“This,” he said, gesturing to the darkness beyond the windows. “This is true reality.” I refused his hand as he moved past me towards the doors. I hung far behind him, but when he swung them open, I could not help but look. This was no trick of the light within the church, for the sky above me was no different than what leered from the hole in the ceiling. There was no moon, no traces of clouds. Only an endless Stygian darkness that could have ended just above the treeline or stretched beyond comprehensibility.  
  
Everything around flickered. Much as paper burns away when held to a fire, the street before me, the edges of the church, the leaves and branches of the trees surrounding, all burnt away into that same blackness, restoring themselves once my gaze tore itself away and onto something else—an endless cycle of disintegration and renewal, held together by the same insubstantial essence that made up the scenes of a nightmare.  
  
“All that you see and recognize that yet remains is the reason for our mission's incompleteness. For all that remains in your sight and to you seems real is but an illusion That which is illusory, unknowable—that infinite blackness—it is enlightenment, it is truth, it is knowledge, it is whatever incomplete and inadequate term you might have for it. All else is a veil cast over reality.  One that we are attempting to shatter. One that can only be broken by one of spiritual fortitude who has seen no wrongdoing, no spiritual turmoil. This place,” he muttered, his words trailing off. His eyes followed something in the shadows—I saw it too—an outline of something hunched, cruel, limping. “Is much crueler looking to me than it is to you, and to you more than it is to your brother.”   
  
“I don’t know what you’re going to do with him. You shouldn’t do it with any kid. But Joshua does not deserve whatever this is.” The sentence ‘aren’t there other kids here’ hung on my tongue, but I couldn’t bring myself to say it. I knew he could tell. “Just… take me instead. Let him go, please.” The words hurt to say. I didn’t regret them.   
  
“It is the turning of fortune’s wheel,” he said. “There could be no other, I am sorry. We knew Joshua was Pneumatikoi—and I know you do not understand, and we do not begrudge you. He \*will\* understand. You can still hope to. But you have little time. They are coming, and once they do, once all is complete here, there is no going back.”  
  
“Why are you telling me this?” I said. I was holding back tears and fighting every instinct to run, fight, or to just lie down and accept whatever was to come.  
  
“None are here by coincidence,” he said. “Not I, especially not Father Gallagher. We are all in Eleos seeking something, even though we did not always know that we were doing so. We are in life always awaiting the truth. It is that which lies at the bottom of the layered falsities that we call history, merely layer upon layer of illusion after illusion. Whether one knows it or accepts it, we are constantly on the search, and it is full of pain, distraction, and further untruth.”  
  
“I never wanted any of this.” The words hung in the air. There was so little to which they did not apply.  
  
“Neither did I,” he said. “But I chose it all the same—the only thing that matters.”  
  
“Why?”  
  
“We have both lost loved ones, taken from us unjustly.” He gazed into my eyes, manic and desperate. “They’re out there, Cecilia. They’re waiting. We only need to reach them.”

“It doesn’t work that way,” I said. “I don’t know what you’ll find here,” I choked up, “But there are some rules that cannot be broken.”  
“I’m sorry you still feel that way,” he said, anger rising in his void. “But so be it. As it stands, this place is not for us. Not until it is done. Come, join me here, where it is safe—where we can await your brother. Or else cast yourself into the unknown.”

He turned back into the church, and walked back towards the lectern. I did not follow. I stared at him long and hard. There was something in him that was earnest. Something that was searching, that was certain he would find what he sought. But I would not let myself be deceived. I would not seek out whatever this place would conjure in place of my parents. It would be better to deal with the devil I did not know than the one I was sure was misguided, and, if not misguided, operating in the name of an evil I would rather spite than serve.

So I turned away, and walked into the darkness of Eleos. I ran. I knew not where —towards our house? Towards the road out? I did not know. I was under no illusion that I could escape this place on my own volition. I was going to run until I had reason not to.  
  
I ran past the parking lot, down the street. Past \*Alice’s Fresh N’ Hot,\* recognizable from its position, though not through the building that was being eaten away by the nothingness, and not by the sign, the letters to which had melted into violent black streaks, unintelligible.  
  
I heard Logan shouting at me.   
  
“Cecilia! Stop! You don’t understand!” but I ran on.  
  
I heard Peter Moss from the lunchroom.   
  
“No one is ever lost, Cecilia.”  
  
Alice from the coffee shop.  
  
“You’re a part of us—of our little world.”  
  
Father Gallagher too.  
  
“We are so close.”  
  
I whipped my head around, knowing I would see nobody and still searching. I knew I could not escape, but I could still defy.   
  
“We love you, Cecilia. Come to us.”  
  
The voice of my parents, together, in sync.  
  
Unreal.  
  
Illusory.  
  
I screamed, closing my eyes and my ears as I pushed ahead, in what direction I was no longer sure. Into the woods, away from the light and into the comforting darkness.   
  
I pushed through the brush and was whipped by branches, my legs scratched by the greenbrier and my hair tangled by leaves. All there was to do was get away. I passed through White Oak, sprinted across the road, past Logan’s house, itself a seething mass of throbbing voidstuff, so far removed from its reality, away. 

So

The nearest town was far, and I’d never make it. But I was close to being out of Eleos. I would not die there.

“Cecilia!” This time, my brother. Real, in front of me. A voice not in my head but true—true as one could hope in a place that likely had no care or awareness of the truth, whatever the Abbot thought.   
  
False or not, it was the only thing worth running towards. It took me towards the road.   
  
“Cecilia, Cecilia, Cecilia. Help me. Please,” Joshua cried. He sounded disoriented. Confused. I didn’t blame him.  
  
I had been sprinting for so long and did not feel it until then, until I saw the road, when I knew I was close to the voice. Close to saving Joshua. My dirty shoes spattered onto the pavement, I panted, groaned in pain from the little red streaks drawn across my legs by the briars. There was light, bright, approaching, a rumbling sound.   
  
It came closer.  
  
“Joshua!” I cried.   
  
Then there was the screeching of rubber and I shut my eyes tight against the blinding lights. ",1,1765742960.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pmnmr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifiwriting/comments/1pmnmr6/sf_a_lil_somethin_somethin_for_goldfish_fridays/,[SF] A Lil’ Somethin’ Somethin’ for Goldfish Fridays,"(Author's Note: First story I've written in quite a while and my community college writing workshop didn't hate it so I thought I'd share online for some feedback as well. Sci-Fi, Comedy, Stream of Consciousness. 5,023 words.)

Perhaps it is selfish of me to tell the truth at this point. Perhaps all the legends and myths about me, no matter how unnecessarily flattering, serve their purpose. Alas, I am an old man now - an old man who wants to sit in the grass and tell a story.

You’ve probably heard some rumor or other, but honestly, it doesn’t matter who I was before that fateful day I went to Goodwill. I barely remember myself and care even less. What I do recollect from is having some loose time in my day to go to the local thrift store and browse their fantastic wares.

It is impossible to know what I was looking for. No one goes to a thrift store knowing what they’ll get, they just vaguely hope they’ll find something that’ll irrevocably change everything for the better forever. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened to me. I remember wandering the aisles perusing the various objects on display; a Mickey Mouse alarm clock with faded plastic, a VHS copy of “Homeward Bound: Revelations” repaired with duct tape, a child’s science fair project that could’ve been mine for the low, low price of seventeen dollars.

It is a testament to the power of The Correct Item that it would stand out amongst this embarrassment of riches. In my minds eye I remember it levitating there, bobbing and rotating in midair emanating a golden aura alongside a gentle, angelic harmony. Of course, as you all know, I am prone to my romantic revisionisms and flights of fancy; like most inanimate home goods, it was probably just sitting there on the shelf.

Regardless, I stumbled towards it arms outstretched, mouth agape, heart racing and refusing to believe the evidence of my eyes until I held The Correct Item in my hands. This was it! The one missing piece in my life that would forever change everything evermore. A masterful blend of form and function, The Correct Item offered a plethora of practical utility while evoking a design sensibility that all at once nodded towards the Classical and Baroque but at the same time seemed thoroughly modern, maybe even with a futuristic flair. It would be impossible not to admire it for its otherworldly beauty while engaging with its myriad of uses. And incredibly, it was only five dollars more than what I had valued it in my head.

The Correct Item fit perfectly into that little, awkward nook in my apartment where nothing else seemed to fit. And like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle sliding into place, my whole apartment came into a singular focus upon its installation; a harmonious, unified bow with The Correct Item as the knot at the center.

The effects of The Correct Item were immediate. With it in my possession, I started waking up not just on time but at a time that allowed me the space before work to eat a healthy breakfast, read a little, and sit outside admiring the morning dew while enjoying a cup of coffee. At work, I suddenly had extraordinary ideas regarding customer satisfaction, project workflows, operational procedures, and even HR practices that would satisfy employees and management alike. My relationships flourished. I easily charmed and ingratiated myself amongst even the most prickly of strangers. Friendships that I had maintained since childhood that had seemingly plateaued all of sudden went a level deeper. The dead end relationship I was in was able to be resolved in a graceful and mature manner where we remained amicable and we even introduced each other to our subsequent partners. And not to mention I was better at sex than ever before, reaching #1 on the local leaderboards.

All were in awe when I had guests over. “Wherever did you get this!?” they would exclaim in amazement and I would chuckle in response, swirling my spaghetti martini in one hand, “Oh, I just picked it up somewhere. Unfortunately, they don’t make things like this anymore.” My guests would rush online, trying any avenue to purchase a Correct Item for themselves, but alas, they only encountered scam posts and cheap knockoffs that were either comically and uselessly small, or branded with the logos of pop punk bands we’re all too embarrassed to admit we liked at some point or another, or made with MDF treated with a chemical that caused migraines and was prone to spontaneous combustion. Years later, historians would discover the company that made The Correct Item went bankrupt after their warehouse containing their entire stock was swallowed by a sinkhole caused by a nearby fracking operation. They never bothered picking up the only surviving unit that was on display at a mall some 90 miles away.

Word spread about my marvelous possession. Friends and family would find any reason to drop by. Curious neighbors would ring my doorbell and sheepishly ask to see it. After excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught the local reverend, who had turned up demanding to see what his flock was buzzing about, giving The Correct Item a big kiss. A mother running for the PTA board requested to have a photo op with it. After a groundswell of support due to the photo she changed her slogan to “Samantha Scarlett - The CORRECT Choice.” She won in a landslide with a voter turnout that, up until that point, was record setting not just for the local level but statewide as well.

Over the years, people have asked me about this period of time, “Weren’t you concerned that people were using you just to get to The Correct Item?” Each time I would laugh heartily, slap my hand on their shoulder and give them a sympathetic, yet pitying, look. They didn’t get it! And perhaps you don’t either, so I will lay it all down here - the quality of goods you buy are a direct reflection of who you are as a person. And The Correct Item, with its rich mahogany inlays, sturdy construction, and comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity, was simply the best purchase anyone has ever made. People came to conflate, rightly so, the durability, beauty, and usefulness of The Correct Item with the richness of my moral character. Not to mention the fact that I bought it at a thrift shop showed a thorough comprehension of commercial, economic, and mercantile matters. As such, I started to become a leader of the community. People would come to me for advice regarding love and life, squabblers would show up seeking arbitration, politicians would come seeking guidance on their various policies and upcoming votes. And I was correct in all things.

I didn’t really quite grasp the influence my object and I exhibited until the night it was almost stolen from me. Certainly, you know the story - it is but one of the many myths and legends repeated to school children about me - but please, indulge an old man for a moment.

I remember the man. He had the unfortunate name of Alan Rickman, forever living in the shadow of someone he had nothing to do with but happened to share a name with. He was a friend of a friend of a friend and one day accompanied one of that train to my apartment. He stood agape in the presence of The Correct Item, never tearing his gaze away from it while his friends and I talked. As goodbyes were underway, he let out a desperate and meek, “Can I touch it?” His friends laughed at him and told him to stop being weird. I gave them a scornful look and then smiled benevolently, “Of course, you can.” He ran forward like a child and clasped the giant dial on the front of The Correct Item with both hands and twisted it, gasping and giggling with each resonant, metallic clang from the inner workings of the mechanism. After three turns of the dial, I sternly let him know that was enough. I was trying to be kind and was unaware the effect of such a privilege would have on him.

Later that night, Alan Rickman was caught scaling the side of my apartment building with a burlap sack containing a crowbar and a sledgehammer. It is hotly contested to this day whether he meant to steal The Correct Item or to destroy it. The people that caught him were a self-styled band of vigilantes calling themselves The Disciples of the Correct Item, and they had taken upon themselves to watch over me and my home. This was the first I’d ever heard of them. I suppose I should’ve been more aware of the sudden uptick of hooded figures sulking about my neighborhood but I chalked it up to flowing crimson robes with gold fringe being back in style again, fashion being cyclical and all that.

The Disciples quickly apprehended Alan Rickman, who was no master thief. As three of them wrestled the poor man to the ground, the rest started forming a makeshift podium out in the middle of the street of whatever they could find. A hot-wired RV made up the main platform and piled around it were various garbage cans, lawn ornaments, and pulled up shrubbery. The end result was less stage and more pyre.

Three Disciples stood atop the RV with a restrained Alan Rickman while the rest formed a semicircle around the base of the pyre, anonymous in their crimson, hooded robes. One on top of the stage blew a strange horn to summon the surrounding community. It sounded like the dying cry of a long gone creature. This is what woke me up and I assumed the same of everyone else - that everyone was coming out to investigate the strange sound. I was wrong about that.

For maybe the only time ever, I had to ignore the Morning Printout coming out of The Correct Item and rushed outside. A large crowd had accumulated around the RV and Disciples were whipping them into a fury.

“Thief!” Shouted some.

“Desecrator!” shouted others.

A man crawled onto some of the garbage cans in front of the crowd. He was well dressed and had a naturally commanding presence about him. The crowd hushed as he raised his arms.

“I’ve been a civil rights advocate my whole life. I’ve defended the rights of everyone and anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities. For I believed in the rights of all no matter the circumstances.” He gestured towards Alan Rickman. “I no longer believe in such things. We should cut off this guy’s hands.” The crowd roared and undulated with eager justice. Torches were being lit and handed out. An enterprising opportunist was selling t-shirts commemorating the event and the biggest man you’ve ever seen pushed his way to the front of the crowd, holding an equally enormous axe in both hands. He climbed to the top of the RV in three large bounds and his silhouette blotted out the morning sun as his thick, hairy arms raised his ax over a trembling Alan Rickman.

“Stop!” I cried out from the front door of my apartment building and another hush came over the crowd. I looked out over the sea of unwavering stares and stepped forth. The people parted before me as I made my way. I clumsily climbed on top of the garbage cans and patio furniture before scrambling onto the roof of the RV. “Release this man at once,” I said through heavy breaths, exhausted from my ascent.

The Lead Disciple faced towards me; lit torch held at an angle above her head. An unnatural darkness obscured her face and made it hard to see her expressions. The huge man, ax held high and trembling as if only held back by a hair trigger, stared at me through the slits in the black sack covering his head. A tense silence permeated the air.

“The Proprietor… has chosen… MERCY!” the lead hooded woman bellowed in a sickly rasp and the crowd once again erupted in pandemonium, this time in revelry and celebration. Alan Rickman was unshackled and he fell to my feet, crying and clutching my legs. I picked him up and embraced him, demonstrating how I regarded him as an equal. He wound up becoming one of my closest friends, confidants, and personal advisors.

But of course, you know who Alan Rickman was. He was the general I put in charge to lead the campaign to retake Eastern Europe during The Unbeliever Uprising.

Soon afterwards I asked the Disciples of The Correct Item to disband, mostly because of their strange, alarming, and completely unwarranted behavior. I tried to be polite about it but they still seemed pretty upset and embarrassed. I think it was all these guys really had going on.

A few years later, I saw that huge guy working at a pet store somewhere in Beaverton, Oregon (yes, the stories are true! There WAS a Beaverton, Oregon and it was every bit as magical as you were told and more! Shame about that asteroid, though). He was pretty easy to recognize due to his immense size and the fact that he was still wearing that sack over his head and the same black tunic cinched at the waist with a bloodstained, tattered rope. After a few awkward hey-so-good-to-see-yous, we chatted for a bit and caught each other up on our lives. He explained that times were rough ever since the market for cultish executioners had dried up and he was forced to find other work, although he was doing alright now. I commiserated and told him about how so incredibly busy I was ever since several democratic governments capitulated to my growing influence. Once the pleasantries were exchanged, I relayed my need for a “lil’ somethin’-somethin’” for Goldfish Fridays down at the roller rink and he was more than helpful in helping me find exactly what I was looking for.

“Hey,” he called out to me as I was leaving, one foot out the door. I turned and he continued, “Those were some good times, huh?”

He was probably talking about the event with the Disciples (in which case, I think he was being overly sentimental and sappy over something that was actually a troubling display of what happens when men don’t have hobbies and healthy, offline communities; also, the whole thing lasted, like, five minutes, tops) however overall there was a spirit of optimism and hopefulness that swept the world. As people heard of my messianic figure and the cool thing I bought at Goodwill, they took to the streets to beg their leaders to become part of my new world order. In a country once called The United States of America, an unremarkable nation disregarded by history, a nationwide ballot measure was cast to strip their government of power and hand it all to me. The result was nearly unilateral in my favor and when questioned, the naysayers were horrified to realize they were holding their ballots upside down and not only did they against me, they had voted “Yes” on the referendum to make all the birds louder. One by one, all the countries of the world followed suite. For the first time in history, all the guns fell silent, all the mouths were fed, and all of mankind was able to join hands and be united under a single banner in peace and harmony in the name of The Correct Item.

Except for the Unbeliever Uprising, I forgot about that. Fuck, that was a nasty affair. Thank god for Alan Rickman.

Under my leadership, Earth entered a worldwide golden age. I ruled with utmost fairness and kindness for the entire populace with The Correct Item at my side, its Goodwill price sticker still stuck on one of its various levers. On the rare occasion two factions would come at odds with each other, and the mere sight of The Correct Item wasn’t able to qualm their quarrels, I was able to present hidden third options that satiated all parties involved. Earth became one economy. All of the planet’s resources were allocated appropriately and technology advanced in leaps and bounds to the point it resembled what would’ve been called “magic” a mere ten years ago and the word “impossible” fell out of use in the common vernacular. As a result of this monumental progress, Earth was more than prepared for the Calcinthinoid Incursion.

A scientist at SETI had one day entered the rough dimensions of The Correct Item as the frequency bandwidth the gigantic dish was currently receiving and had picked up subspace chatter from an unknown source. The messages were spoken in their alien language, which really just sounded like English but as if bugs were speaking it.

“The puny Earthlings are no match for our might! They are ripe for harvesting!” said one voice.

“Prepare the fleet at once!” said another.

“No need to rush!” screeched a third, “There’s no force in the galaxy that’d unite a planet quickly enough to resist our forces! We can use this time to learn to play the instruments we always wanted but never got around to!”

“I don’t know, I always get a little sad thinking about learning an instrument at my age,” responded the second alien, interspersing the clauses with an animalistic chittering, “It makes me feel like I’ve squandered the neuroplasticity of my youth.”

“Listen, nothing can get back the time we’ve already spent, but as the saying goes - the best time to plant a xinblorp was twenty cycles ago; the second best time is now. Let’s just do what makes us happy in the here and now and then we can go crush the weakling humans!”

Of course, the Calcinthinoids were working off of outdated information and when the invasion force arrived, the hammer of their armada smashed against the anvil of our planetary defense forces. While the Calcinthinoids were watching tutorial videos and plucking along to rudimentary melodies, Earth built up a vast, interconnected network of Orbital Hypernuclear Missile Platforms and Automated Plasma Railgun Stations, all backed up with carrier dreadnoughts, each capable of deploying 10,000 fighter craft. All these planetary fortifications were centralized in the ionosphere above the apartment where I still lived with The Correct Item.

The battle, still unnamed as historians argue whether it should sound really cool or somber and important, lasted for three days. The soldiers of the Calcinthinoid Empire, having never known defeat, fought fiercely. But they had come up against something they’ve never encountered. Something unstoppable. Something impervious to any weapon. For in every human there lies a fundamental truth that they’re willing to fight and to die for. You know what it is. It’s what we all say every night before bed. It is what every mother whispers to their newborn infant. It is what all schoolchildren say as they pledge allegiance to the human race every morning. Say it with me now.

“Somewhere out there is an item available for purchase that will change my life for the better.”

You know, I shouldn’t have mandated that children pledge allegiance to the human race. That was a strange thing to do.

Did you know this battle is where the Rings of Earth come from? It’s true. In the years following the battle, all the debris coalesced in an orbit around the equator. It may look beautiful from the inner atmosphere, but if you were to take a stratopod to the edges of our atmosphere you’d see the aftermath of those terrible few days; remains of spaceships floating lifelessly, bodies drifting among unexploded and unstable ordnance rendered too unsafe to retrieve, endless amounts of Calcinthinoid equivalents of Squire brand guitars. It is a sobering sight. But it is a ring we wear proudly. For if you look at Earth from anywhere in known space, you can see us wearing the symbol of our galactic superiority.

Humanity chased the routed Calcinthinoid fleet all the way back to their homeworld (coincidentally also called “Earth,” but, you know, like a bug would say it). It was only a matter of hours between establishing orbital supremacy and our quantum marines raising the Earth flag above the bombed-out structure of the Theocractic World Parliament of Calcinthin. As it were, at the moment of death Calcinthinoids would telepathically transmit the last sight they would ever see to the rest of their kind. So heavy were their losses, the entire species was almost constantly bombarded with the image of The Correct Item, a silhouette of which was stenciled upon the tail fins of our interplanetary cruisers and fighter craft. By the time we had boots on the ground, large swaths of the Calcinthinoid population had defected from their hectocentennial theocratic hegemony and begged our troopers for any information about The Correct Item.

I designed the Earth flag, by the way. I chose to represent Earth with a picture of Earth I found on Google Images. Next to it is a picture of The Correct Item I took with my phone, with my apartment fully visible in the background as I never really learned how to mask items in Photoshop. Underneath both of these pictures is the word “Earth!” in a neat typeface I found on dafont.com.

Having defeated the predominant force in the galaxy, Earth was now known as the prevailing regional power and all the civilizations and planets that suffered under Calcinthinoid rule flocked to ingratiate themselves, offering tribute to myself and The Correct Item. My apartment became the nexus of all political and commercial activity in all the known galaxy, much to the dismay of my landlord who tried to argue that intergalactic dignitaries and their entourages violated the provisions in the lease that stipulate that guests can only stay 3 days and pets weren’t allowed. A judge found his complaints frivolous and took the time to state that the comments regarding pets was xenophobic towards the Bloogians, who looked and acted like golden retrievers wearing top hats. After he lost the lawsuit, my landlord swore that he’d never rent an apartment to an intergalactic emperor ever again.

Peace and prosperity reigned throughout the Milky Way for over a century. I could bore you with the ins and outs of this period and the responsibilities bestowed upon a man of my station - managing hyperspace trade routes, dictating which planetary systems belonged to which spacefaring consortium, unmasking myself as a surprise guest in televised singing competitions - but what is important in my story is that eventually my star started to fall.

I was invited to be a guest of honor at a science symposium on a planet called q’Lanthenurp (but, you know, like how a bug would say it). I’d been to many functions and had stopped caring about them long ago, but in recent years it seemed like the flow of prestigious invitations had been stymied. My closest advisors, at least the ones who remained after all this time, begged me not to go.

“Your excellency,” they cried, “There’s no need for you to attend such a lowly and dangerous event as a science symposium!” I gently held up a bony, weathered hand to silence them. It had been a while since I was invited anywhere. I didn’t even notice they didn’t ask for the presence of The Correct Item.

I was a bit shocked to be seated so far in the back, and with a pillar blocking any possible sight of the main stage. Seated next to me was a Loplolian eating a hot dog. I eyed it hungrily, realizing my travel schedule hadn’t allowed me the chance for a bite in quite a while, an unfair burden on a man my age; at that point the oldest human to have ever lived. I leaned towards the Loplolian and asked, “Hey bud, where’d you get the hot dog?” I forgot that Loplolians take their time in responding to any inquiry. A simple answer to “How are you?” might take one upwards of a week for it to consider all the possible angles of response. Its mouth hung agape and all four hands clasped the hot dog tightly as its brow furrowed in immense thought. Meanwhile, onstage, someone suggested a way to reverse the effects of that disastrous referendum all those years ago and make the birds quieter once again. Pandemonium erupted. In all the uproar, an older scientist stood and shouted, “That’s impossible!” but no one really understood what that meant. “Oh, save your archaic language for the emperor; he’s the only one who’d understand you, old man!” shouted a hot, young scientist wearing sunglasses and a lab coat with the sleeves torn off to reveal extraordinarily built arms. I was expecting a stunned hush to come over the crowd, but it seemed everyone had forgotten I was there.

“Hot dog stand out front,” said the Loplolian, finally taking a bite.

The symposium entered a recess when one scientist ran another through with a saber for suggesting the existence of Scondos, which no one actually knew what they were, but we all know how science symposiums can get. I brushed past the paramedics and riot police rushing in, who were muttering “Fucking scientists, every goddamn year.”

The hot dog stand was just outside the main doors. A long line stretched across the terrace, around a gigantic statue depicting a man in a lab coat defiantly chugging something from an Erlenmeyer flask while two other men try to stop him, and out across a nearby road impeding the flow of traffic. Desperately hungry, I thought that I might be able to abuse my position for once in my storied career and cut to the front of the line.

“Hey, hey, hey!” cried the hot dog broker in a thick New York accent, “Who do you think you are!?”

“I sincerely apologize, I’m the Sovereign Emperor of Planet Earth and Her Outlying Colonies, I just…”

The man cut me off, clapping sarcastic over his shoulder, “Oh! The emperor! Look, everybody, it’s the emperor of the friggin’ Earth!” He stopped clapping and shrugged aggressively at me, “What? You think that makes you better than everybody else!?”

“I try to not let it get to my head, I just -“

“Back of the line, bub.”

While I stood in line for two hours and forty-five minutes for my hot dog, I pondered the ephemeral and cyclical nature of things. Tides ebb and flow, mountains form and wind blows them away, laundry is washed, folded, worn, and then washed again.

When I got back to Earth, I made the proper arrangements and booked a stratopod to where I knew in my heart this journey would end. I wore simple robes so that anyone looking would assume I was nothing more than one of the few scattered hermits still living on the Earth’s surface.

“Are you sure this is where you wanna get off?” asked the stratopod operator, her voice ripe with confusion and worry. I looked her up and down; judging by her age there was a distinct chance she had never stepped foot on Terra firma in her life. Smiling, I wished her a nice day and alighted onto the ground below.

The stratopod lifted up and into the sky, zooming off to one of the arcologies in the sky, egg-shaped cities made from glassy, transparent aluminum panels held together by biomechanical vines. If one listened closely, they could hear the whir of the trillions of semi-organic blades of leaves and grasses working together as wings and rotors to keep the grand bastions of humanity afloat among the cumulonimbus clouds, but this sound could easily be mistaken for the wind. These sanctuaries dotted the horizon all across the world and they are where most of humanity had chosen to live. You are probably reading this story in one right now.

A great, grassy plain stretched before me, miles of emerald green grasses swaying in a soft breeze and surrounded by pristine blue mountains. A reclaimer drone whizzed past me at an astonishing velocity, looking for any last bits of rubble or ruin of the various roads, homes, strip malls, libraries, and prisons that used to dot this area; in the blink of an eye it was already almost to the horizon, leaving behind a windswept wake in it’s path and only stopping for a split second to reconstitute an old street sign into its base elements to be reused in the restoration of the environs of old.

After taking in the view, I hoisted The Correct Item onto my back, surprisingly lightweight considering its size and sturdy appearance. While doing so, I accidentally activated a hidden LED panel that showed the current time and temperature.

“My god,” I chuckled to myself, “Even after all these years you continue to surprise me.”

I made off towards the only structure still remaining and operational, to my knowledge, in this sector. It was a squat rectangle of a building with a beige stucco exterior, nestled comfortably in the exact center of this immense field. Large blue letters and the familiar logo acted as a beacon, guiding me towards my final goal.

I stepped into the Goodwill and a glassy-eyed, slack jawed teenager rudely told me that they were closing in fifteen minutes. After a brief back and forth where I argued that just because they were closing soon that didn’t mean they were closed now, the teen acquiesced and accepted my donation. I watched as he placed The Correct Item on the shelf in between a gently used Scondo and a ratking made up of nine shoelaces tied together.

For the first time in a long while, I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. I went outside and sat in the grass, picking a blade and absentmindedly breaking it into halves until I picked a new one, all while staring out at the world I had created. I thought about what that murderer at the pet store said all those years ago.

He was kind of right, I thought, they were all good times.",1,1765742944.0,scifiwriting,0,1.0,False

I am a newly accepted prospective student and am planning to visit Dublin around the holidays to check it out. There are no formal tours of UCD's campus available when I am going during the break but I thought I might go out on a limb and ask if there are any current UCD students around during that time that might be willing to give a tour to my mom and I. 

A little info about me! I am in my early twenties, from Maine (in the US), hoping to join UCD in the Joint Honours program in fall 2026. My studies of interest would be Irish Folklore and Drama Studies, and I do professional theater outside of my current job as a preschool teacher. My hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons and hanging out with my dog, Wirt. 

Message me or reply to this thread if you have any interest! Things I could offer in return would be a coffee, sweet treat, or something else like that of your choosing while we're in the city. 

If anyone has extra info generally about how to explore UCD while the campus is on holiday, let me know! Tips and tricks and all info welcome.

1pmnmgi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmnmgi,Bar Tutto Dinner - 12/12/25,"Bar Tutto, Joe Flamm’s newest place, is the kind of all day restaurant that fits naturally into your plans, whether you stop in early for coffee and pastries, or settle in for dinner. Rooted in Italian cafe culture, it has an easy, welcoming feel that encourages lingering without ever feeling formal.

I went for dinner Friday and thought it balanced simplicity and depth. Oysters arrive briny and clean, layered with smoked shallot, grilled olives, and Calabrian chili for a subtle hit of heat. They were also super accommodating and allowed me to do a half order. The mozzarella crostino is rich and comforting, with squash mostarda and candied pepitas adding sweetness and crunch. The roasted carrot salad is hearty and well composed, combining broccolini, orzo, pistachio, and burrata, all tied together with a date vinaigrette that adds warmth without heaviness.

The bavette steak anchored the meal. Cooked beautifully and served with a bright peperonata sauce, it feels both classic and right for the space. Fries on the side are crisp and indulgent, especially dipped into the smoked garlic aioli. 

Bar Tutto does not overcomplicate things. It focuses on good ingredients, thoughtful execution, and being a place that works just as well for a casual stop in as it does for a full meal. I’m excited to go back and try out brunch and lunch. ",1,1765742925.0,chicagofood,0,1.0,False

So I'm posting this here so that my person (who I am madly in love with!!) can find it, hopefully, eventually. Hi sweetheart are you here?!!  

You are my sunshine on the coastline. Tugging firmly & fondly on my heart srings and soul in the most beautiful way possible. You are the soundtrack of my life. Every song that I listen to reminds me of you. If you are listening to it, singing to it, watching it, reading it etc, I want to too.  

I am learning new things about myself everyday that passes. As I want to learn from you. If you teach it to me, then I know it's the correct way to do it. My absolute favorite way of course. Us learning and building together is beyond beautiful, it's magical. You solidify my confidence, as I will always be here to build your confidence, because you can accomplish anything.     

I want to grow old with you and be that lovely couple on a covered porch, on a wooden bench (we made that!) that swings. Sipping iced tea and watching the hummingbirds feed, as our collection of cats chase each other and the dog is patiently sitting there waiting for one of us to throw her ball.    

The delicate vibration of your essence fills me with ecstasy. Warming my soul and hugging my heart. I want to ask you out to go on a date. No pressure okay. We can chat over coffee, walk through the forest, or just skip to an extra long embrace with lots and LOTS OF **KISSING**. I just want to hear your voice, it's been too long since you've spoken to me. I watch the videos with you in it that I have saved on YouTube. I try not to cry, but yeah, I want to reach right into my monitor and squeeze you. Even just brush my hand against your body and hair.   

I watch our movies and laugh at our private jokes. Keanu, Snatched, Twilight series and more. I love your sense of humor. It's as demented as mine lol.   

I am attracted to you in a cosmic, magnetic way. I'm attracted to you because you are the hottest person alive! As in this is a bond that will never be broken. Spanning into the next life and beyond. I'm going where my heart leads and it's heading directly to you.    

I'm your love fool covered in glitter. You're a prescious angel to me. When I close my eyes it allows me to see. To be there for you now, even though we are separated by space, but not spiritually. To be there for you when you are psychically ready. I'm here for you however you may require. Do you want any or all of this? I'll do anything to sooth you and everything to make you smile.   

Happy Hanukkah my beautiful queen! I have a present for you. A present for both little flowers as well.

I’ve been on a health journey, and I completely look, act, and feel different then I ever have, so I am trying to navigate this dating journey. 

I met this man on Hinge (I am wanting a real LTR) and we matched, and have started great conversation. We quickly went out on a first date that ended up being like 5-6 hours long. (Brewery, food hall dinner, then coffee). It was extremely pleasant, and we went home. He confirmed that he loved it and would like to see again. Next day, he let me know that he had to leave out of town for a few days, so I asked if he would be open to meeting again before he left. This time was long again, at a coffee/wine bar (again, there for like 5-6 hours. We talked (with him initiating a lot of them) about big topic things like dating goals, love languages, red flags, kid goals, and more. He told me he is a hugger, so I made an effort to hug even though I am very much still learning how to appreciate my own body. We didn’t kiss or anything, but it was much more “close” and I made an effort to touch legs, it was tough for me but I wanted to. 

I really like talking to him, he’s easy to communicate with, and it seems that he is very interested but I have zero experience on how to navigate the next week with him out of town and when he comes back. I don’t want to pressure to see again, nor do I want to let it fizzle away. He is very much an introvert. 

I also really want to get more intimate because everyone is like “you have to kiss within the first couple dates” but it’s a bit out of my league, like him lol. I also am trying to find the balance between not texting 24/7, not being too much, but also just being myself which I am very much a flirty fun texter especially with those people I like and am close with. 

Any date ideas for the next time I see him? And is this something I should just instigate right after he gets back into town? I don’t think I want to have sex yet, but I don’t want to be stuck in the friend pattern.

A new girl joined my group that is very nice & cool. She hangs out with girls from another group, which I dont see very often due to different schedules. In this group, there is a girl that I really like, lets call her F & there are a few occassions that I hope she feels the same. We've met through this common girl we know, so she knows me & we also follow each other in socials. Here is a breakdown of the events in chronological order:

1) In a lesson, my group & F's group were together. F had a book with a disney princess on it, which I noticed. I commented in a funny but cool way about it, & she bantered with me about it back & forth. 

2) I was with 2 friends of mine in a hang out spot for a coffee. 2 tables to my left, F was sitting there with her friends. At some point, a person sitting next to me, tapped me in the shoulder & said: ""hey man, this girl wants to know where you' re from"". I look & the girl he talked about was F, giggling in a funny way, lets say. I didnt say anything, cause maybe she was joking, so I just laughed too & continued my conversation.

3) Before a morning lesson, we all sat in a corridor waiting for the prof. to arrive. I sat with my group & in front of me sat F with her friend from my group. When she sat she looked at me & together with her friend, F said ""Good morning, wont you say hello to us?"" In the same way when we bantered about her book. So I responded in a smart way & again we bantered for like 2 minutea, before she left for a separate room

4) In a lecture, while I was sitting down, I noticed F standing in a wall to my left around 6m distance from me. So I looked towards, her way & she saw me, smiled & waved her hand in a hello gesture. I did the same to her. After a while, I kept looking towards her. At some point, she was talking to her friend in her ear, & at that point I looked at her. Our gazes again found each other & she continued speaking to her friend, while keeping eye contact for a good amount of lets say 15s. 

Now, these are very minor events, maybe they dont mean anything. So, in your opinion, is there a posaibility she is interested to me? Should I maybe talk w/ her through the phone to keep touch or should I talk to her in person after the Christmas break (because we all leave now)?",1,1765742372.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

Can be big and luxury or little things like:
	•	being offered water or tea

1pmne3f,https://i.redd.it/7l33i1r0487g1.jpeg,a quiet Sunday reminder,"had a slow Sunday morning today. I drove out to grab a coffee and a couple things from the bakery. no agenda, just enjoying being out for a bit. while I was driving, I passed a lot of families heading into church. parents, kids, everyone dressed nicely, the whole Sunday routine. it made me stop for a moment and notice how different my life looks from that picture. my days are quieter, less structured in that way. it wasn’t sadness, more of a brief wondering. one of those thoughts that passes through where you ask yourself if you’re missing out on something you’re supposed to want.

when I got home, I opened Facebook and saw a post about marriage. it said that if you’re unhappy in your marriage, to comment the word *HOPEFUL* and you’d get a guide. what caught my attention was the comments. there were so many women typing that word. sooo many. women from all walks of life. younger, older. women with beautiful family photos, big homes, smiling kids. women posting travel photos with their partners, arms around each other in places people dream about. women who look successful, confident, put together. and others whose profiles showed very routine lives, the kind that look steady and predictable from the outside. different lives, different stages, but the same quiet uncertainty showing up in the comments.

it made me realize how little we really know about anyone else’s happiness. how much of what we see is just the surface. the lives that look the most complete aren’t always the ones that feel that way on the inside. that earlier moment in the morning, seeing families heading into church, came back to me. it’s easy to assume fulfillment just because something looks traditional or “right.”

I’m happy being single right now. seeing that post was a reminder not to let those passing moments of doubt grow into something bigger than they need to be. everyone questions their choices at times, no matter what their life looks like. today just made me feel grateful for where I am and for taking life at my own pace. happiness doesn’t follow one path, and it doesn’t always look the way we expect it to. 

I hope everyone finds a little peace today, wherever they are and whatever their Sunday looks like. :)",5,1765742368.0,SingleAndHappy,1,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a showdown where the Minnesota Wild (-146) strut into the arena like they own the Zamboni, while the Boston Bruins (+122) sulk in the penalty box, still bitter about their 7th-place power-play ranking. The moneyline? A boring 59.3% implied probability for the Wild, because even their coffee shops in Minnesota serve more caffeine than this team allows goals.

**The Spread:** Minnesota’s -1.5 goal line is as steep as a Zamboni’s learning curve. The Bruins, with their anemic 3.28 GAA, are basically a sieve with a .884 save percentage. But hey, at least Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen’s got a 4-5-1 record—because *everyone* wants to be a losing goaltender in December.

**Total Goals:** The over/under is 6.0 goals, and the odds are 1.95 for the ove

I've lost dozens of close friends because of it. I've always kind of thought of it like I'm letting my friends go because I'm moving on with my life (graduating high school, then college, then moving away, etc.), but now I'm settled and I don't have anything like that to look forward to anymore.

Whenever they reach out to me, it usually takes me a while to respond too, just because I'm busy during the week.

I care very deeply my friends, and I tell them how important they are to me whenever we can get together, which is not very often at all anymore.

We were chatting as they opened the box and WHAM, he pulled out a gorgeous B30 in rouge H!!!  I could not believe it! The whole afternoon I was there was so special! I paid for my bag and then shopped for a few other items to restart my spend.

At the end of my wonderful time in the boutique I sat and enjoyed a delicious coffee relishing in the day.

In the end, I was so very happy that I didn't push to know in advance of my surprise!

Guests asking about storm-watching tips, heating instructions, aurora alerts, and “how many steps to the top” while the wind howls at 100 km/h was turning her remote sanctuary into a constant distraction. So I created Haven, an automation that stands firm like the lighthouse beam, turning isolated winter stays into fully-booked, self-guided Norwegian wonders.

Haven uses Make as the steadfast watchman and Lodgify to open the heavy door. It’s rugged, warm, and runs through rain and gales. Here’s how Haven endures:

1. Guests book via Lodgify and answer three questions: arrival by car or boat, coffee or tea preference, “Wake me for aurora?”
2. Make instantly sends the gate code, lantern instructions, and a PDF with storm-safe walking paths 48 hours before arrival.
3. When the Bergen aurora forecast spikes, it texts every current guest: “Green dance starting now – best view from the lantern room.”
4. Checkout morning it auto-captures a dramatic photo from the fixed webcam (waves crashing, snow on the rocks) and posts it to Instagram with “One stormy night free next week – link in bio.”
5. Sunday night the keeper gets one Slack message: “This week 5 stays, €3 120, 100 % 5-star, firewood replenished, beam steady, wind dropping. Brew cocoa and watch the sea.”

This setup is pure Bergen winter poetry for lighthouse hosts, remote rentals, or anyone offering solitude on European coasts. It removes every interruption and leaves only the rhythm of waves, the sweep of the light, and the quiet joy of guests finding peace in the storm.

I've been learning Italian with my tutor for almost a year now. The lessons are great - we're the same age and gender, and we often share personal things during our conversations. We even follow each other on Instagram. We don't really talk outside of the lessons, but sometimes they run 20 minutes longer simply because we end up chatting.

My tutor lives in Lithuania, and I live in Italy, so we've never met in real life. Today, though, they told me they're going to Prague for Christmas. We started talking about how it could be nice to meet, but the thing is, I don't really like Prague, and they know that. They said, ""Oh, I know you don't like Prague - don't come. We can see each other in June when I come to Zurich,"" which would actually be much closer for me. I really don’t like Prague, and funny they remembered it.

Now I'm not sure what to do. Part of me feels like I'd be happy to travel there just to meet them and have a coffee, but at the same time it feels like it might be too big of a gesture from my side. I also have two other friends in Prague whom I could meet, so even if I go, it would be a nice trip anyway.

What do you think? Would you do that? Is it weird - or just fun?

1pmn6nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1pmn6nj/im_winning_i_think/,I'm winning I think.,"So I went in for my normal yearly physical. Turned out my AST was 65 and ALT was 220. My doc wasn't excited about those numbers and I came back a week later for more tests. They were better but still high. Got to go in for a liver panel blood test the next week. Then I got an ultrasound of my gut. Turns out liver was swollen as was my spleen. Gallbladder was fine. My cholesterol was fine, blood pressure good. 

  
So I was referred to a liver guy, had to wait 6 weeks to see him. From the start I read up on what I could about fatty liver and started eating as clean as I could and cut out beer. I miss my scotch. I never drank daily much less weekly but my occasional Scotch...I miss it. 

  
So I eat clean and smaller portions and have lost weight. Lots of green leafy veggies, not a lot of bread. I started at 233 and am at 213 now. I can see the weight loss. 

My normal eating is I'll drink water that has lemons or limes soaking overnight. Then coffee with some oat milk at work. Around 11-1 I'll eat lunch usually a whole grain with chicken or fish and veggies. Some days with a smaller salad some days I'll just have a large salad with chicken for lunch.   
Dinner consists of green veggies cooked with olive oil and garlic more chicken and fish and sometimes a grain sometimes with a sweet potato. 

I will have a snack usually nuts or raw veg. I found these seeded cracker things at Costco and they are good. I will treat myself to a fancy coffee randomly. Cause I deserve a peppermint mocha damnit! Most times with the sugar free flavors. Or even a cookie. Usually every two weeks or a week and a half depending on how I'm feeling. 

My liver guy said to continue inue doing what I'm doing. Gave me another blood test and I have a FibroScan is this week. My AST is 29 and my ALT is 62. Still a smidge high but so much better. 

  
Thanks for you all posting here. It's nice to read what all your doing to heal up. 

  
So I didn't have pain before. Now that I've been eating clean I have some pain, like it's sore.It's weird. Doc wants to see how the FibroScan turns out, he said it could be the healing process and unless the pain gets bad or spikes to make sure I stay hydrated. Anyone notice pain when it's getting better?

Which is great — I work alone, don’t have to split tips, and honestly I’m pretty good under pressure. There are days I struggle, days I’m absolutely flawless, fully locked in, flow state, built for this. And then there are weird days where I’m just slightly off, or customers manage to disrupt my rhythm in the most creative ways possible.  


Today was the busiest day so far. I was feeling okay going in. People kept flooding in, I fell behind a bit, but nothing dramatic. I stayed calm, thanks to previous experience working somewhere that was basically nothing but rush hour all day.

The real problem is my boss.

This man is a demon from hell, and his wife — who works in the kitchen — is only marginally less vile. I’m fairly convinced he’s coked up half the time I see him and he hates me because I'm maybe a little autistic and unable to cater to his sense of pride/superiority and he probably senses that my submissions to him are only pro forma. He owns multiple businesses, and this café is basically a side project for him. His *main* place, which makes like ten times the money, is literally across the street. Because of that, he shows up during my day shifts pretty often.  
  
He has issues with the smallest, dumbest things I do to make my job more efficient or cater to the customer expereience. Some examples:

* Using coffee cups as risers so espresso doesn’t splash (they’re literally designed for this)
* Putting a single clove on a chai latte as garnish (apparently too expensive for a $6 drink)
* Making tiny layout changes to reduce friction, like slightly tilting the grinder or moving milk from the bottom cooler so I don’t have to bend down every single latte

Whenever he shows up and there’s any kind of traffic, he insists on “helping.” Which usually means forcing me to tell him what drinks are up so he can make them, which at that point I'm already fucking pissed because I KNOW he will make the ugliest Cappucinos I have ever laid my eyes on full on stiff white bubble foam, and don't get me started on the Matcha, this guy just fucks every drink up and I will have to serve them to people that ordered them from me.   
And sure, in theory this could speed things up… except he also gets orders wrong. A “cocoa with cream” becomes just a cocoa. Then I have to tell him there’s cream on it. He then *doubts me*. Makes me pull up the exact order **that I took**, just to prove it. I was LIVID.

  
Once he’s done ruining drinks, he switches to micromanagement mode. He walks around pointing out any dirty dish on any table and reports it to me — especially when I’m actively taking orders or entering them into the system. All of this under the guise of “helping.”

One time after cashing out, he straight up demanded a share of the day’s tips. In principle, whatever. But considering the emotional and actual distress this man puts me under?

The worst part is that the second he shows up, my performance tanks. So much of my brain circuitry is used up, by having to manage my frustration, keep being presentable and nice to customers even though I feel nothing but rage inside. Sometimes I feel like I'm about to CRACK. And I can’t trust the system anymore. He randomly takes orders, puts them into the POS, just inserts himself. Then he’ll blame me for not putting out cutlery in time — for a table I didn’t even know was getting food because *he* took the order. 

What I really hate is knowing he probably walks away thinking *he* is the reason the shift didn’t collapse. Meanwhile, I’ve had plenty of insanely busy days where I handled everything completely fine on my own. Those days were honestly awesome.

Today was just the worst version of all of this combined. I got home and needed to vent. To top it all off, he thinks I’m stealing from him because I don’t always enter orders *before* I start making them. I understand why that looks bad, but we have a daily menu and there are always items that aren’t in the system. When that happens, he has to manually add them — which somehow takes him five minutes per item. 

So I have to keep interrupting him to step away so I can enter orders, because there’s already another customer waiting. It turns into this constant back-and-forth just so I can access the POS.

There’s honestly so much more I’m leaving out, but yeah. That’s where I’m at. I didn't even talk about his wife yet.. 

  
  
Not looking for advice it's more like I want to feel seen in my anger and frustration and would love to know if any of **you** feel seen by my post or have had experiences, please share them and be specific.

I’m 25 from India, 5'8, brown-skinned with brown eyes, and I work as a software developer. I like calm evenings more than loud nights. I don’t smoke or drink. I’m Christian and my faith matters to me. I value honesty, respect, and consistency.

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I open up, talk more, and stay loyal. I’m not into games or drama. I prefer connections that grow slowly and feel stable.

Most days end with coffee, soft music, and a show I’m probably overthinking 😅. I enjoy anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-based movies. Music is important to me, especially late-night playlists and sharing random songs.

I like cooking simple food, quiet walks, hiking, stargazing, museums, cafés, and relaxed weekends at home. I still play Genshin sometimes. I enjoy travelling too. Japan and Switzerland are dream places, but I’m also happy staying in and talking about life.

I’m looking for someone kind, emotionally open, and steady. Long distance is okay if both people put in effort. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

If this sounds like your vibe, message me with your age and where you’re from.
No pressure. We can just talk and see where it goes.

I just think the context of how we met could be important, so here's what happened.)

I went to a coffee shop with a friend, and I noticed this guy staring at me while we waited in line. I just smiled at him and went back to talk to my friend. When we got to the counter, he greeted us and took our orders. Then, he complimented my hair and asked for my name. After I told him my name, he said that he's seen me before and knows the university I go to. I'm not popular, so this freaked me out, but I thought he could be a student, and he saw me walking on campus. However, he revealed that he doesn't go to my university and he's only been there one time to support a friend who graduated. Eventually, the conversation ended, and my friend and I enjoyed our coffee, then left to walk to a store down the street. About 2 hours past and my friend and I walked by the coffee shop again. This time, the guy (I'll call him Joe) was standing by the entrance, and he screamed my name down the street to get my attention. He waved me over and asked for my number and social media. He was cute and respectful, so I agreed to keep in touch. 

**Here's the part about ghosting:** 

We got each other's information a week ago. We both have jobs that limit our time with our phones, but we texted often during the day and had lengthy conversations in the evening.  We started getting to know each other, and we want similar things in a relationship and for the future. The only problem was that he was a little dry over text. I started all our conversations for the day, and I would send messages that kept the conversation going while he would ask a few questions like ""how are you?"" and go back to dry responses. I thought it was strange, but he would occasionally send random selfies of himself at work and update me on what he was up to, so I didn't think much of his dry responses. One night, I went out with some friends and told him I wouldn't be able to talk much. He told me not to worry about it and that I should have fun. The next morning, I texted first, and he was dry, but worse than usual. He was strictly responding with 1 word messages. I stopped texting to see if he would try to start another conversation. It has been a little over a day since then and I haven't heard anything from him. 

I've been ghosted before, so I deleted his number. I get really anxious about this stuff, though, so I could be overreacting. Is he ghosting me? Should I have waited or sent him a message about how I felt? Or was it best for me to leave it as I did? ",1,1765741706.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

Right off the bat, they were scratchy and prone to not working. The 4 shown below have stopped working entirely. I was getting the green to work for a short period but it stopped out of nowhere the other day. 

I was able to get them all to work briefly right after purchasing, doing a swatch page for my bullet journal. But when I tried using them again for \*actual\* use, the red & gray immediately stopped working, the blue a little bit later. 

For context, I do store them tip down in a coffee cup, and I live in an area that is very dry (little humidity) currently. After opening and using them initially for the swatch page, I did not touch some of them for a week or two, and I don't use them regularly. I have been using with more success another set of Papermate gels (the typical colors set), although I did lose the red, brown and yellow pens from that set too (but I also let it sit unused for a couple years, so...)

I've had some success in the past with reviving very old gel pens bought at a thrift store, so I know some techniques, but I can't figure out how to take these apart to try my tricks on. 

Plus I'm just frustrated that a brand new set of pens works worse than some random ones I found thrifting. 

Should I just give up on these pens in particular? On the Papermate brand in general? If I'm going to spend my hard earned money on pens, I expect them to work for at least a little bit!

1pmmzi7,https://i.redd.it/mxfjrj8e387g1.jpeg,Short Narrative: Scoobydoo,"# Lost and Found, Twice by Muze Artists

  


The courtroom, early morning, was quiet in the way storms are quiet just before they break.

Kelly sat straight-backed beside her young attorney, one hand resting on her son’s knee. Bobby swung his feet gently, too young to understand why his mother’s jaw was set so tight, why the man across the room wouldn’t look at them.

The highly ethical judge adjusted his glasses and spoke clearly. 

“The assets accrued during the marriage will be divided equally.” 

Kelly exhaled for the first time in months. Five years of marriage. Five years of being told *don’t worry, I’ll take care of it*. Half would be enough to start again. Enough to keep Bobby safe.

Her husband stood. Smiled thinly. A smile that never reached his eyes.

He was gone within a week.

Accounts emptied. Properties shifted into shell companies. Phones disconnected. A man born into old money who knew exactly how to disappear when responsibility knocked. No alimony. No support. Just silence—and lawyers who shrugged.

Kelly sold what she could. Jewellery first. Then furniture. Then pride.

They moved into a smaller place. Then smaller. Then not at all.

One night, when the fridge held only mustard and hope, Bobby asked quietly, “Mommy, did I do something wrong?”

She turned away so he wouldn’t see her break.

The neighbour downstairs—a woman who smelled like coffee and kindness—noticed the light on late one night and knocked. She listened. She didn’t judge. She handed Kelly a folded piece of paper.

“Community shelters,” she said. “Not just beds. Help. People who care.”

Kelly cried after the door closed—not from shame, but from relief.



Across town, George noticed the silence first.

Scoobydoo should have been there.

The five-year-old German Shepherd–Labrador mix usually greeted him at the door, tail wagging, eyes sharp and loving all at once. She was friendly, loyal—but George always joked she had a built-in moral compass. Scoobydoo barked at bad vibes, not people. More than once she’d positioned herself quietly between George and someone who made his skin crawl.

That morning, the house echoed.

George searched the neighbourhood. Then shelters. Then more shelters.

Each door closed gently, sympathetically.

“No, sir. Not today.”

Hope thinned like worn fabric.

George was thirty-five, semi-retired by choice, financially comfortable in a way that let him be generous with time. He didn’t need much. Just his home. His routines. His dog.

Without Scoobydoo, everything felt off-balance.



At the community shelter on the edge of town, Bobby laughed for the first time in weeks.

Scoobydoo had found him first.

She sat beside him as he coloured, her head resting gently against his leg. When Bobby flinched at loud voices or sudden movements, Scoobydoo leaned closer. When someone raised their voice nearby, she lifted her head, watchful—but calm. Protective without aggression.

Kelly noticed it immediately.

“She’s special,” she whispered to a volunteer.

Scoobydoo slept outside their room at night.

Guard dog. Comforter. Friend.



George arrived at the shelter on a rainy afternoon, tired but refusing to give up.

The moment Scoobydoo saw him, she froze.

Then she ran.

She stopped just short of crashing into him, tail wagging wildly, eyes bright—but she glanced back.

At Bobby.

George knelt, overwhelmed. Scoobydoo pressed her head into his chest, then turned again toward the boy, whining softly.

George followed her gaze.

Bobby held Kelly’s hand tightly, fear flickering across his face.

George understood then.

Scoobydoo had made a choice—but not one that excluded him.



They talked. Slowly. Honestly.

Kelly told her story. George listened—really listened.

George told his. About choosing a quieter life. About Scoobydoo’s strange gift for sensing danger. About how empty the house felt without her.

Bobby looked up. “Can she stay with us too?”

Scoobydoo sat between them all, perfectly content.

They didn’t rush it.

They shared dinners. Walks. Time.

Eventually, paperwork followed.

A shared adoption.

A new kind of family.

Scoobydoo slept in the hallway—exactly where she wanted to be. Watching over everyone.

Kelly found work. Stability returned. Laughter followed.

George found something he hadn’t known he was missing.

And Bobby learned something important:

Sometimes, the things we lose don’t come back the same—

They come back **better**.",1,1765741360.0,ShortNarrative,0,1.0,False

. I do not care about the ritual or tactility 

. I do not care about heat up times 

. I care almost exclusively about what tastes better

The job market’s rough, people are tired, and most “networking” stuff honestly makes me want to disappear into the floor.

A few of us in Toronto are trying something small and different: a Speed Coffee Chat, not a loud networking event, not a panel, not a “pitch yourself in 30 seconds” thing, currently we have 10 people.

The idea is really simple:  
you show up, grab a coffee, and have short, low-pressure conversations with people who are also just… figuring things out.

We’re doing it with a kind of *blind box* twist, you don’t start with job titles or company names. You get little prompts and clues instead, and you slowly discover shared interests, similar experiences, or totally different perspectives. It makes the conversations feel way more human and way less performative.

We’re hosting the first one **6PM to 730PM Jan 8, 2026, downtown Toronto** (exact spot will be shared privately). It’s a small group, coffee-based, early evening. There *is* a ticket just to keep numbers manageable, but we kept it low.

“But hey, at least you beat the commies, right?” Louis said, handing his friend another beer.

Ivan laughed heartily as he shook his head, an awkward smile on his face. He leaned forward to grab the can. That sense of humor missed the mark way more often than it didn’t, but that laugh was definitely one he needed that early on a Sunday.

“I guess I did, didn’t I?” he said with a shy smile. Louis dug back inside the portable cooler and produced a second beer, this time for himself. Raising his can like a young freedom fighter celebrating the end of the war at some musty frontier tavern, he proclaimed:

“A toast. To my favorite unsung hero of democracy.”

Ivan raised his can back at him, nodding once with feigned reverence. He cracked it open, loud and messy, and Louis followed suit. The foamy taste of victory was followed by two long gulps from each. Weather-chilled cans of Huxley before twelve o’clock; truly, the breakfast of champions.

That morning so far had been a load off his back, he decided. Weather was warmer for the first time since the end of summer, and it was a good change of pace from the usual gray, chilly afternoons he and Louis would spend with their hands in their jacket pockets, trying their hardest to enjoy their weekly meet-up by the time winter was already on its way back.

The two were sitting on their usual lawn chairs, with their backs toward the house as they faced the lake. Anabelle was inside cooking her signature bland pasta dish for the monthly parents and teachers association meeting in just a few hours, and had basically locked the boys outside to prevent them from ruining everything by pretending to help. It was a morning too good to be wasted by trying to pretend you’re useful, the two had agreed anyway, and they were glad to be outside enjoying their choice brand of cheap beer. The air was usually way fresher in Lou and Belle’s little hideaway, especially in mornings like those, which was one of the reasons Ivan enjoyed saving the date. The other, as his tired smile denounced, was his best friend’s company.

They were quiet for a short while, listening to the sounds of nature and staring at the shades of autumn beyond the opposite lakeshore. Louis had the habit of keeping conversation in good spirits whenever he could tell his friend had gone through a rough week, which was sorely frequent, but he knew how to keep a few moments of quiet introspection in between their usual banter for good measure.

“I just wish having beat Ilya’s people would’ve paid for my renovations, at least.”

“Hey”, said Louis, pointing a loose finger at him. “You got a medal.”

“I don’t want medals, I want new roofing.”

“Dismantling a coup d’etát will only get you medals. You want a new house, help them win one next time.”

Ivan smiled and shook his head, once again. He was easy to annoy, but strangely enough he was never bothered by his friend’s casual humor about the duress he was under during the days of the civil war. In a sense, he knew that was the best way to rationalize it. If nothing else, it was pretty much the only one left. Old Lou was just yanking his chain, sure, but deep inside he did feel this stoic sense of accomplishment from his service.

“Medals are okay, I guess”, Ivan mumbled. “Except you can’t eat them. Believe me, I tried.”

Lou snorted. Ivan liked to crack jokes about it, but his friend knew better. For unremarkable working class people such as Ivan, or at least as he always saw himself, having the chance of being part of history was as big of a deal as a long-lasting marriage, or raising healthy children. Except in a strange, collective sense, which he never quite knew how to put into words. It’s not like he ever saw the need to, considering how much of a good job the eggheads at the Praetorian Front propaganda division had done in his place, mostly so he could focus on the shooting.

“Sometimes I wonder if they shouldn’t have won”, he said in a somber, almost deadpan tone.

Looking enviably comfortable in his seat compared to Ivan’s trademark stiffness, Louis just side-eyed his friend with skepticism as he catched that sentence in the middle of a particularly long swig.

“There’s nothing to ‘wonder’ here, comrade”, he said finally, sounding like the sort of expert in speculative history any man in his forties becomes after his third beer before noon. “It would be exactly the same.”

Ivan didn’t laugh. He wasn’t sure if that was one of Lou’s jokes or not.

“Except we’d probably still be at the munitions factory”, Louis quickly added. “Fueling local conflicts until compulsory retirement. And our boss would be Kravchenko’s drunken nephew or something.”

“You mean we’d have dodged Karlsson as our taskmaster?” Ivan asked, this time unable to contain a smile.

“His stingy ass would be put to the firing squad. In front of the whole contingent, to boost morale.”

Ivan didn’t resist and let out a hearty, sincere laughter.

“If they ever did that I would’ve walked into that assembly line every single morning with my hand on my chest, singing ‘O men of valor, from to the marshlands to the sea, gift your mother, Old Preatoria, one last glimpse of her children free’”, Ivan chanted, straightening his back and widening his shoulders, closed fist over his chest, his voice mimicking the baritone of the old socialist hymns of their youth. Louis cackled like a teenager trying to signal how much he just understood some adult’s dirty joke at the dinner table.

“Don’t let the neighbours hear you, I don’t wanna get arrested.”

“There’s no one in half a mile.”

“I know, but shut up anyway.”

Snatching a heartfelt laugh out of the class clown felt good for a change, but it didn’t last. He knew Louis was right. It might’ve been just a throwaway joke about how their old enemy would have been their boss while their actual old boss would’ve been dead, but there was nothing funny about how things did end up. Ivan wanted to believe that having lost to the sworn enemies of the republic would’ve been ten times worse, but he knew better. He did wonder, sometimes, if they shouldn’t have won.

Staring into the distance, he felt the sounds of nature now seeming disorienting, cluttered over one another. An aggressive mass of noise that surrounded him like the pressure of the sea during a deep dive. He felt the freshness of the outdoors slowly melting into a sense of danger, the sort one shouldn’t be able to find within civilization, but at the same time felt like what civilization had become in its essence.

His thoughts were swooped in half by the ominous sight of a large raven flying by, the dense blackness of its shape massive and jarring against the brightness of daylight. Ivan could feel his mind drifting back into the sinkhole from which he struggled daily to rope it out, sometimes to no avail. Suddenly, it wasn’t such a beautiful morning anymore.

“I lost the appeal”, he could hear his voice say as he stared into nothing.

Louis froze for a second, his eyes widening as he turned his head like a startled prey.

“You what?”

“You heard me.”

“Say you’re joking.”

“I wish.”

He sat in silence for a few seconds, looking away, pretending he did not intend to go into detail. But the cards were already on the table. He had laid them himself.

“Judge says the Committee is in their right to deny me any further prescriptions, as well as consultation”, he continued, trying to mask his denial. “Apparently my case was filed under the bill that took the brunt of the budget cuts, so it falls under the new regulations.”

“Wait, you mean the public health one?” Louis asked, genuinely puzzled. “But I thought the treatment program for veterans was under the Reparations Act.”

“Yeah, me too, but as it turns out they filed my case outside of the program to make it easier for them to screw me over first chance they got, and now they have it”, Ivan spat out. He could feel the cynicism building up inside him. “How’s that for reparations?”

Louis had a sour taste in his mouth. That court appeal was possibly Ivan’s last chance of sustaining his injuries without having to pay for the medication. Gone in the stroke of a pen.

“But what about the army…?” he asked Ivan, running out of ideas.

“They can’t do shit. It’s not their money.”

“This is ridiculous, they should be putting a motion in your favor or something, you’re their guy.”

Ivan laughed. And then he laughed some more. His laugh sounded and looked how most animals must perceive a spitting cobra defending itself.

“‘A motion.’”

He crushed the empty can on his hand and hurled it inside the trash bag. Leaning over the cooler to fish for another one, he just looked Louis square in the eye and said:

“Be for fucking real, Lou. Those assholes want me gone.”

Leaning back, he cracked it open and continued:

“I made them look like a bunch of clowns. Not like they needed any help with that, anyway.”

Down the hatch. Even needing to approach that subject made him thirsty. Louis, on the other hand, was starting to consider going back into the house and asking Belle if she had already thrown out the morning coffee.

“You’re a war hero, for fuck’s sake” was all he could say. The stink eye Ivan directed at him made his mind drift once again toward reptiles and venom glands.

“What the hell do you think this is?” Ivan asked, gripping his beer can like the armrest of a tyrant’s throne. “Some mushy dandyboy afternoon flick like those you’d take Belle to pretend to watch? Like a hundred years ago, when we were all dumb kids and someone still had any hope for this shithole?”

Louis said nothing. He just stared at his friend with genuine concern. Maybe a slight hint of frustration, but that was it.

“There are no war heroes, pal” Ivan continued, already setting his sights back into the distance. “Just disabled morons like me, who can’t even apply for a day job without having their pensions revoked. And then having it revoked anyway, because the government we bled for decided we are dead weight.”

It rattled inside his ears like the cackling of boiling oil, of the fire that consumes. The quiet alienation of hearing your own voice and thinking it’s someone else speaking through you.

“‘War hero’. What a riot”, he continued, the anger slowly giving place to the usual brand of cynicism. “You need to stop watching that foreign propaganda they clutter daytime television with and maybe go for a stroll downtown during business hours. See for yourself how us ‘war heroes’ are doing.”

To Louis, that man sitting on a lawn chair a few feet away, downing a lukewarm can of Huxley while half pretending to enjoy a sunny afternoon, was a complete stranger. He was, for all intents and purposes, his best friend. But at that moment, Ivan looked less like himself than he looked like a nightmare about someone he hoped he’d never become.

“Yeah, fuck it”, Ivan said finally, sensing his friend’s discomfort. “I’m not even mad at any of this. Not anymore, at least.”

His voice was a searing monotone at this point, unfazed and bled dry. Louis had known him for a lifetime worth of bad times, it wasn’t hard to tell when he had something bottled up for a while. As it was, it may as well have spilled by accident.

“Okay, but how did– How did any of this even–”, Louis tried to articulate, desperate to say something. He just took a deep breath and settled for a simple “When?”

“Last time I was there. Last week or so”, Ivan said, still not looking back at him, trying his best to look dismissive. So far, it hadn’t been his best effort.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Didn’t want you losing sleep over it, I guess”, he said, still looking away, hinting at a half-hearted shrug. That did sound sincere, Louis had decided.

The stretches of silence between the short exchanges were starting to appear longer than they actually were. Not only to his deeply concerned friend, but to Ivan as well.

“Besides, what’s the point?”, he continued. “It’s done.”

“You should have told me, Ivan”, he replied, more frustrated than worried.

“Yeah, I guess I should’ve”, Ivan agreed, starting to sound almost bored. “It’s not like there was anything you could’ve done, though. So… Yeah.”

Louis couldn’t do much at that moment besides getting a long, hard look at his best friend’s approach to rock bottom. Ivan wasn’t going to return the look. He wished he was anywhere else.

“So what’s next?” he finally asked Ivan, his gaze drifting away.

“Apparently I need to get some papers signed so I can reapply for the treatment”, Ivan explained. He didn’t sound hopeful about the prospect by any visible stretch.

“Can you actually do that after being denied a second time?”

“Not really”, he said. “At least not officially, from what I reckon. I dunno. I guess we’ll see.”

Ivan didn’t let on nearly as much as he should, but dealing with the pains of his injury was a daily struggle he couldn’t bear the brunt of on his own. Louis could see just how dire the news were, but at that point he was gonna take anything he could get.

“Are you going there again?” he asked Ivan.

“Yeah. Next Wednesday, on my usual schedule.”

“So you’re telling me there’s still a way to make this work.”

“I guess you could put it that way.”

“And do you think it’s gonna work?”

Ivan didn’t answer for what was barely ten seconds, but still felt like almost a minute.

“I don’t even know what I think anymore, to be honest”, he said finally.

That answer wasn’t good enough for Louis. The need to say something to make his friend feel better was ringing inside his ears. Desperation was starting to spread between them like blood on water, and he could already feel the murkiness taking hold of his sight.

“You know if you need anything—”

“I know”, Ivan said promptly.

“I’m just saying, if you need help finding a private clinic—”

“I got this.”

“My cousin could help us out.”

“I said I got this. Don’t worry.”

He suddenly didn’t know what else to say. He just kept trying.

“Look, all I’m saying is, if you need anything, anything at all, even if it’s just someone to talk to…”

“It’s okay Lou, I appreciate it.”

“Me and Belle will always be here for you, I just need you to know that.”

“I know that, and I need you to know that I mean it.”

“Okay”, said Louis. “Okay. Thank you for letting me know.”

Maybe he had no idea how to respond, but Ivan knew that was enough sitting and moping for a whole weekend. He stood up with a groan and threw out the empty can he had been holding for what seemed like half an hour. As he grabbed two fresh ones, Louis stared back at him and reached for his as if he didn’t know what it was for.

“I really need to stretch my legs for a bit”, Ivan said as he walked toward the lake. “My back is about to murder me for the third time today.”

Louis gazed at his friend marching out as he cracked open a beer. After a few steps, Ivan turned around and just stared back, gesturing toward the lake with a slight tilt of his head. He walked along the coast as if only half expecting his friend to join him. Louis finally stood up, realizing his stiffness wasn’t that far removed from that of his friend, who at least in his own mind had always been the stiffer of the two.

Catching up with Ivan, he could see how absent-minded he looked, almost as if pretending to be distracted. As he picked up the pace, Louis said:

“Okay, but about this whole thing…”

“What about it?”, he snapped back. Something in the passive aggressiveness of Ivan’s tone caught Louis off-guard.

“How are you holding up?”

“About as well as you’d expect”, Ivan said, walking slightly faster as his friend closed in. “What’d you want me to say?”

“I want you to be upfront with me.”

Ivan snickered.

“I don’t think you do, buddy.”

Louis stood still for a second before saying:

“Try me.”

Ivan came to a halt. He looked at the lake briefly, then at his feet. He then looked his best friend in the eye and let out a dry chuckle as he shook his head.

“I swear to God I’m this close.”

“Shut up.”

“See?” he said as he immediately turned his back and started walking away.

“Don’t say that shit to my face”, Louis protested, pressing on as he did his best to keep up.

“I mean it.”

“I don’t care. Don’t say it.”

Ivan felt his day getting significantly worse after this brief exchange. It dawned on him like a shroud of shame. Opening up was never easy for him, mainly because he had nothing reassuring to show whenever he did. He could feel a sense of regret settling in, the looming feeling that he had ruined his and his best friend’s only day together by trying to talk about his problems, something he had no one else to help him process.

A few steps ahead, he slowly stopped walking once again and started saying:

“You don’t get it. It’s been tough”, he said as he slowly stopped walking. “Tougher than usual, I mean.”

His voice sounded almost feeble, something that disturbed Louis in a way he couldn’t quite place.

“It’s been getting worse for a while now, but lately it’s like I’m reaching… I dunno, this whole new stage or something. Like I didn’t even know it could get this bad.”

“What the hell are you even talking about, Ivan?” Louis asked, frustrated with so much vagueness. “Is something going on? Something else, I mean.”

Ivan thought long and hard before answering.

“The other day”, he heard his voice letting out. “Like a week ago, or so. I can’t remember now.”

“What happened?”

“I completely lost it. I don’t know what it was, but I just had this weird bout of insomnia. Some sort of panic attack in the middle of the night. Woke up at three in the morning and couldn’t go back to sleep.”

“Did the pain wake you up?”

“No. It was something else.”

“The nightmares, then.”

Ivan said nothing.

“I don’t even know for sure. I mean, I can’t remember. Must’ve been that.”

Louis had a thick coat of skepticism over his expression as he heard that answer.

“You sure it wasn’t something else?”

“Like what?” Ivan asked, hinting at a certain annoyance.

“Like, I dunno. You’re the guy who won’t move out of Weaver Parish Road. You tell me.”

“I already told you there’s nothing there”, Ivan replied, insisting on the annoyance. “It’s just a bunch of trees, same as anywhere else.”

“I can take you to that real estate agent my cousin told me about, I’m just sayin’…”

“Can we just not have this conversation again?” Ivan said, visibly frustrated.

“You could get a nice place downtown with the cash. I mean, the house is pretty big, in decent shape, five minute walk from the creek…”

“The house is not even mine, what the fuck are you talking about?”

“Bill would be happy to sell it if you found a buyer, just think about it.”

“What the hell is this, all of a sudden?” he asked, walking up to his friend’s face. “I’m trying to talk about the shit I’m going through and you wanna peddle that real estate talk again? Today? Of all days?”

“Look, I’m just saying, okay?” Louis replied, raising his beer can on one side of his face and an open palm on another, looking sideways as he dodged Ivan.

“You live in a dangerous place”, he continued as he kept walking. “Things are gonna get tougher to keep in check, now that we don’t know what’s gonna happen to the treatment and all… Just some things I guess you should be taking into account.”

Ivan circled back and got on his face again, this time talking awkwardly close.

“I’m starting to lose my shit here, dealing with chronic pains, the fucking nightmares are coming back—”

“Ivan.”

“And you’re trying to convince me it’s the house I live in?”

“It’s not the house.”

“That if I move into some shithole in the crate-piling district it’s just gonna magically solve everything, am I hearing this right?”

“Ivan.”

“What.”

“I’m sorry, okay? You’re right, you’re going through a lot right now. I get it.”

Still visibly shaken, he kept staring at Louis in silence.

“You’re in a rough spot, and it’s about to get a lot rougher”, he continued, tapping his friend on the shoulder and circling around him like he was a stranger he almost bumped into by accident. “We should focus on that.”

Louis walked along the lakeshore by himself. The dismissiveness in his body language reminded Ivan of his own before he flipped.

“I’m sorry I shit talked your pet spookhouse and the neck of the woods it sits on”, Louis said over his shoulder, approaching the rocky ground of a bank. “By all means, keep them.”

He walked toward the water and sat on an old stump, drinking his beer in silence. Ivan stood still for a while longer. “What a fucking asshole”, he thought to himself.

As he approached the stump, the familiar instinct to keep dragging pointless arguments whenever you’re with your best friend had overcome him entirely. He could hear his voice rattling the bars of the cage his mind had become. “You think I LIKE living in that shithole? That I LIKE those woods?” None of it even made it out of his lips, however. There was something else bugging him, by now.

Standing right behind the stump, he fired:

“I need to know why you’re telling me this.”

Still looking dismissive, Louis took a long swig and rested his elbow on his knee, not looking quite over his shoulder but not straight ahead, either.

“Been hearing some stories”, he said finally. “Stuff that had me worried.”

“How is this even news?”

“I’m serious, Ivan.”

“Well”, he shrugged. “I’m listening.”

Louis seemed reluctant for a second, but as he started verbalizing it Ivan could tell how much he felt like he needed it.

“Remember Juan Carlos?” he asked Ivan. “From the factory days. Used to hang around the bar.”

“Juan?” Ivan said, a bit surprised by the mention. “Yeah, I know which one. Tall guy, dark hair. What about him?”

“He’s been seeing some weird shit lately.”

The somber tone in Louis’ voice was a good indication of where that conversation was heading, but it was too late by then. Ivan had to humor it somehow. Unsure of what to say, he just asked:

“Weird how?”

“He saw some people on his property, a few weeks back. He says it’s them.”

Ivan frowned at that statement, shaking his head.

“How does he know, though? Did he actually see anyone, or…?”

“He did. He says so, at least. Peeked out of his window and there they were, right next to his house.”

“Just standing there?”

“Apparently.”

Ivan shook his head again, raising his hand to his brow. It was clear why Louis had been so quick to jump at the opportunity of hogging him about the property. “Not this again”, were his exact thoughts.

“Since when do you and him still talk?” he asked, unsure of any better way to change the subject.

“You know that dive bar I always tell you about? Where me and some of the boys at the company play pool sometimes, after late shifts?”

“Yeah, what about it?”

“He started showing up a few months back, usually late at night. Apparently he got a job at that new delivery company upstate.”

Louis couldn’t help himself from betraying a warm smile.

“Even started renting this old sixteen wheeler from his cousin, and all. Says he’s looking into buying it. Guy’s gung ho about the whole thing, you should see him.”

“Yeah, sure, but”, Ivan said, not worried about hiding his impatience. “Did he even say what he saw?”

Louis was silent for a moment. That was enough of an answer for Ivan to pick up from where he left.

“Or is it just the usual ‘I don’t know what it was, but I know I saw something’ people around here try to peddle when they forget their kitchen door unlocked or whatever?”

“Look man, I’m just saying what I was told, okay?” Louis replied, sounding more annoyed than defensive. “You asked.”

“Did he even go to the cops?” Ivan pressed on, trying to gauge something out of that story that wasn’t just hearsay. “Or did he just decide to jump to conclusions?”

“He did, apparently”, said Louis, stopping himself before another sip just to add: “Go to the cops, I mean.”

“And what did they say?”

“What do you think? Told him to get in touch with the zoo first.”

“What a joke”, Ivan scoffed. “Did they even go there?”

“Are you fucking twelve?” Louis snapped back. “Do you even know what cops are allowed to do if there’s a risk of a sighting?”

“Sit down on a chair circle and stroke each other’s cocks, would be my first guess”, Ivan answered, unamused.

“Very funny, man. Thanks for answering my first question.”

The two of them were in silence for a few seconds. Ivan stood next to the stump, facing the lake as well. It was obvious to him how frustrated Louis was by his dismissiveness of that particular subject.

“Cops won’t go anywhere before getting a memo that confirms containment measures are in place”, Louis continued, almost to himself. “What do you think they’re gonna do? Shoot the creeps on sight, like they do with humans? Bag ‘em and tag ‘em?”

Ivan just sighed before Louis was even done talking. For a moment he could feel his mind drift back to the days of political persecution, when investigations were taken seriously and quotas didn’t take precedence to solid evidence. Ideally, at least.

“Do cops even arrest people anymore?”

Louis just shrugged, drinking as he pretended to enjoy the view instead of overthinking procedures he had no bearing on.

“So did he?” Ivan asked.

“Did he what?”

“Call the zoo.”

Louis chuckled before drinking some more.

“As if. Fella’s scared shitless”, he said finally.

Ivan wasn’t amused. He was ashamed to realize he had completely forgotten about Juan. They had always lived close by, but his tendency for self-imposed isolation never did his friendships any favors. The two of them were never exactly close, but they did hang out on a number of occasions, back when Louis, Hank and Viktor were always up for a drink or a dozen after they left the assembly line.

Juan Carlos was shy and mild-mannered, but had a way of letting loose whenever he felt he was among friends. Him and Ivan didn’t have much in common, especially when it came to politics, but they always focused on their few common interests whenever they had a one-on-one. Maybe these interactions hadn’t been as meaningful to Ivan’s formative years as the more politically-charged ones, but they were cherished memories nonetheless.

Now, years later, these memories took on a whole new meaning now that he learned skinny old Juan, with his messy head of hair and his dumb smile, was just another middle-aged blue collar worker whose friends had forgotten about. Not only that, but also possibly in danger in a way he didn’t even fully understand. The irony in how similar all of that sounded to Ivan’s own situation wasn’t lost on him, which made it all the more bitter.

“I mean”, he’d say after a long silence. “Can you even blame the guy?”

Louis just raised an eyebrow as he stared at him.

“For what?” he asked finally. “Not trusting the authorities?”

“Between the cops and containment people, what are these ‘authorities’ even planning to do for him?”

“Not much”, Louis scoffed, “if he doesn’t report anything.”

“How is this even safer? What if they decide he’s part of the problem?”

“Sure, that’s a risk—”

“‘A risk’? They do that every single time.”

“But if he did report what he saw, there’s at least a non-zero chance that they can actually offer some help.”

Ivan tried to laugh but it didn’t come out quite right. He was too angry to be cynical about any of it.

“Can you listen to yourself, for a minute? ‘Non-zero chance’? The guy’s a fucking citizen of the country we went to war to protect. He works, he pays taxes. ‘Non-zero’ is not gonna cut it.”

“Okay, comrade”, said Louis, starting to sound like the grumpier of the two. “So what is he supposed to do? Just sit at home with his drapes closed until the scary people go loiter somewhere else?”

“Stop acting like the issue here is me not coming up with solutions for the imaginary problems your bougie ass keeps inventing in your free time.”

This time it was Louis who laughed, and it came out just as smoothly. It was like the barrel of cynicism Ivan carried around everywhere had toppled over and spilled on both of them, covering the two from head to toe like it was boiling tar.

“Sure man, let’s just ignore the fact people are disappearing every other week.”

“That is not the issue.”

“Then by all means, explain to me what happens to be the issue”, said Louis, sounding progressively more insulted by the level of absurdity that conversation was beginning to approach. “Because I don’t see anything more serious than that taking place inside the Triangle right now.”

“Damn buddy, I don’t know?” Ivan said, feigning confusion. “People seeing shit that isn’t there, maybe?”

“Okay, so that’s what you think this is. People making stuff up because they’re bored yokels with too much free time. Apparently that’s my case, too.”

“That’s how they keep you under control.”

Louis let out another loud, ugly bootleg of a sincere laugh. Ivan was unfazed by it, doing his best to cling to any scrap of dignity he believed he still had left in that exchange.

“You don’t sound the least bit crazy right now, buddy”, said Louis, not looking at his friend as he brought his beer closer. “Nah, not by a country mile. Absolutely sane and level-headed.”

“Sure, let’s both act like I’m the asshole, that’ll do it” Ivan said, pretending to agree as he stared at the first direction in which Louis wasn’t in his field of view. “Juan’s gonna fuck himself over as soon as he picks up that phone, I can promise you that.”

“That’s his only choice.”

“He’s not even in danger.”

“He lives in Weaver Parish Road, Ivan”, said Louis, outraged to the point he was actually looking at his friend once again. “Do you even read the reports anymore?”

“There’s nothing there.”

Ivan’s voice was firm and dry in its conviction. He did not look back at Louis as each word came out.

“They still haven’t found those kids.”

“It’s just a bunch of trees.”

1pmmshc,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1pmmshc/losing_too_much_weight_on_carnivore/,Losing too much weight on Carnivore,"Hi everybody, new to the thread and don't typically post on reddit but I just wanted to share my experience.

So for context, I love the carnivore diet. Well, I hate it because my sweet tooth literally lives in my soul, but I absolutely love how I feel on carnivore health wise. (And yes I know sugar is bad bad bad and carnivore kicks cravings etc... I am also very stubborn and have no issues being strict, I just cry a little inside) I have a long list of medical issues affecting most systems in my body, with multiple autoimmune disorders including (most prominently) a degenerative spine disease (which is where I notice the biggest benefit with this diet). I also have severe environmental allergies, like my allergist asked why I ever leave the house severe, which makes me laugh because I work on lawn mowers which are covered in just about every allergen in my area. I've noticed significant improvement here as well. Not to mention the daily fatigue, insomnia, restless leg, maaaaaassive brain fog, and short term memory issues all have a positive response to the diet.

The one and only issue I have on carnivore is I have an overly active metabolism and severely struggle to keep my weight up. From history, I have only been able to gain weight and feel okay through muscle gain, which I know carnivore is good for, but I top out at 125lb (I'm a 5'8"" 31yo Female) I also have an itty bitty stubborn stomach and my appetite is complete shit. I'm talking I can cook a pound of beef, get a few bites in and I'm full to the point of gagging on the next bite. I've been looking into a few options to help with this and will actually be getting a bunch of brisket that my mom has offered to make into jerky. Brisket seems to be one of the better options for my situation as it is one of the fattier options and I can snack all day long ( I know that might be weird with my appetite but I have no response for this). I have also added in by products to include dairy in moderation (primarily heavy cream and cheese) as well as the occasional honey in tea. Okay, you caught me... I also have coffee... and a splash of organic maple syrup... But it's for everyone's safety.

I am also extremely active due to my work plus I am not someone that can hold still for too long (combo of ADD, anxiety, and my spine condition requiring frequent mobility to avoid stiffness). Obviously the more active, the more you should eat to maintain weight, hence my predicament. That said, I am going to try introducing resistance training since it is low burn off and helps with muscle strengthening and build. Who knows, maybe I'll go from scrawny toothpick to finally visible from my side profile.

Despite this, I will say my blood work, my mind, my body, my sleep, my gut, allergies, etc... all are at their best when sticking to carnivore and I am so thankful for it. If I can figure out the weight loss issue then that will just be icing on the... uh... fat on the bacon? Butter on my beef? You catch my drift.

Anywho, that's my current experience. May or may not update but I'll try if I find what ends up working for me. Thank you for reading!",4,1765740870.0,carnivorediet,6,1.0,False

1pmmr2f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmmr2f,Trip to Finland 13.12.2025,"We woke up at 3 a.m. (the kids got a bit more sleep 😅). We made some coffee and breakfast 🍳. Sadly, I don’t have Webasto, so I started the engine about 20 minutes before departure to warm it up a little. At the same time, I packed the last things into the car.

We started our journey exactly at 4:00 a.m. It was a two-hour drive (157 km). The morning roads were quiet, almost no cars at all — just our Volvo, and we were singing the whole way 🎶 My wife and I thought the kids would be sleeping in the car… oh boy, how wrong we were 😅 They finally fell asleep again just a little before we could board the ship.

On the ship, we had almost two and a half hours to eat, sleep, and kill some time — and that’s exactly what we did ☺️ We played in the kids’ zone, walked around, and checked out the shops. As we arrived in Helsinki, we were called down to the car deck to get ready to unboard.

I had never driven in such a big city before, but honestly, it was fairly easy — no problems whatsoever. Our first destination was my wife’s dad. We stopped by a shop and then drove to his place somewhere in Vantaa. We had a great time there and I took some photos of my Volvo. After that, we had the idea to go to Porvoo.

At first, I heard “Volvo” and thought, what?! There’s a city called Volvo in Finland? 😅🤣 After realizing it was Porvoo, I made a lot of jokes about that one. We went to see some rocky cliffs and did some sightseeing around the town. Later, I split up with my family — they went to visit the Porvoo Christmas fair, and I went to take photos of my Volvo in Porvoo. By the way, there were so many Volvos there. Later, I found out that Porvoo has a lot of Swedes 🤷🏻‍♂️ Maybe that was the reason.

On our way back, we visited my friend and had a great conversation. He also had Foliatec brake caliper paint for my Volvo — which definitely needed to make its way back to Estonia 👀

Our last stop was the Helsinki Christmas fair and some shopping. We had a really nice time there, although sadly there was no snow ❄️😭 Then we headed back to the ship 🛳️. Everyone was exhausted — both of our sons tried to sleep at every possible moment. In our family, I’m the only one with a driver’s license, so I also tried to get some sleep on the ship, but sadly couldn’t manage it for long.

We arrived back in Estonia, grabbed a coffee and an energy drink, and started the drive from Tallinn to Viljandi. We sang all the way home, and I didn’t feel tired — not even once.

The next day, we woke up to snow in Viljandi ❄️ I love snow (winter in general, to be fair), and this was our family’s biggest trip yet since we had kids. Next time, we’ll try to go a little farther and a little longer. But this time — it was just so cool and so much fun.

Thank you for your time.

Thank you, Volvo, for keeping us safe, confident, and comfortable on our drives ♥️

I was supposed to train her, and I was instantly smitten by her beauty. We had a great connection; we laughed and talked the entire shift, and she even brought me food to eat. I had planned to ask her for her number that night, but I didn’t.

The next day, I was talking about her with my relief (let’s call him Niet, who’s 24). He revealed that he had a crush on her too and expressed his desire to have sex with her. He’s known to pursue every girl he works with.

Four weeks later, she worked with me again, and like the first time, we had a great time talking. We even followed each other on social media.

The next day, as I was about to leave my shift, I was surprised to see her. Apparently, Niet’s partner had called off their plans. I’m pretty sure he told his partner to cancel so he could spend the day with her. I was suspicious of him, but since it’s out of my control, there’s nothing I can do.

Before I left, we talked, and I asked her if she was busy the next day. She said maybe, and she suggested i hit her up on social media. I agreed, and I said goodbye.

The next day, I called her around 12 p.m. since I’m not a big fan of texting. We chatted for a while and asked if she’d like to hang out later. She agreed, so when I picked her up, we headed to the mall. On our way, she mentioned that Niet was heavily flirting with her and that she wasn’t interested. I was glad to hear that.

We had a fantastic time at the mall, learning a lot about each other, including her preferences and dislikes. Afterward, we went to a place called “Shitpotle” for dinner, where we continued our conversation. Finally, I took her home. She shared her future plans, revealing that she intends to join the army in a couple of months. I felt a bit sad about it, but I reassured her that I’d be there for her and support her. Before dropping her off, she asked me to drop her off at a gas station in the middle of the night. I was taken aback and informed her that it’s too dangerous for her to walk alone in that neighborhood at night. However, she insisted. In my mind, I wondered if she didn’t want me to know her address or if she didn’t want her parents to see me drop her off. Either way, I totally understood where she was coming from. Regardless, after a brief back and forth, we made a pinky promise to stay in touch until she gets home. After hugging, she left for home and said she might see me at work.

After she returned home, we bid farewell, ended the call and left home. She texted me a couple minutes after and said "" It was fun hanging out. Thanks for lunch and coffee. "" After I texted her, she thumbs up my message and left it at that.

The following day, I wasn’t planning on reaching out to her, but I decided to go for it. I texted her and asked if she’d like to accompany me to the store to help me pick out some clothes. Afterward, we could either go to lunch or do something else. She agreed to go.

After picking her up, we headed to the store, which was quite busy. She assisted me with the clothes and stayed there for a while. Then, I asked her if there was any place she’d like to visit after. She suggested that I choose.

As we were about to leave, I asked her what she wanted to do next. She said she wanted to go home. I was a bit surprised but agreed. We went to a nearby store and bought her some candy.

After we got out, I asked her if she was hungry. We could have gotten some food before I dropped her off, but she declined. So, I took her home.

On the way home, we listened to her favorite music and talked about various things, including her current job. After dropping her off, she left some candy on my car and said goodbye, saying she’d see me at work.

A few minutes later, I received a text from her: “I’m home. I had a great time. Thanks for the snacks. Drive safe.”

I responded back and she thumbs up my message and left it at that for the day. The following day, we didn’t really text. We did but took forever to respond.

The next day, I sent her a text asking how she was doing, and she replied that she was doing well and that she had been invited to a concert. She mentioned that a guy at work had complimented her on her appearance and invited her to a rap concert. She also suggested that if she could bring her friend, she might go. I was initially shocked but managed to remain composed and tried to be a good friend. I encouraged her to go, saying that live music is always a great experience. I also suggested that she could take her friend for safety. She agreed to go and said that it would be her first concert. She mentioned that she would be singing a song called “Thotiana.” I couldn’t believe it was her first concert, and I couldn’t help but say, “Oh really? And as long as she’s happy , I’m happy too!” I asked when the concert was, and she responded the next day that it should be fun.

This is my first post ever and i want some advise. Disclaimer this is not my first languege. So I have ADHD. I was diagnosed 3 years ago (im 22 now). For the past 2 years i have been experiencing panic attacks a few times a month (2-3)... only in the summer months At first i didnt even know they were panic attacks and later did nothing to fix them or learn about them. I also want to say that i have been living in a pattern that just today i realised. In spring and summer i had so much energy and will to live. And when the autumn and winter came i wanted to stay home and play music, watch shows read , see nobody ect. I thought i had seasonal depression but i was ok with it. But this time i didnt stop when autumn came. I 'pushed' throw. 5 weeks ago i had a panic attack so severe that i stayed in bed for 3 days. Negative loops, disassotiossion, extreme anxiety, insomnia ect over the next weeks i worked with a therapist to start doing everyday things again without panic attacks (CBT). This is going good. Also we descovert that i have trauma. I only cried when i lost a very loved person and now i cry every day for the past week. Also went to a psychatrist and got Zoloft 50mg and zanax and told me i have GAD. I didnt take them because my gut told me not to at least not for now since im getting better on my own. Just today i realisted the pattern of my life and i came to the conclusion that this is not normal. So im here today, making connections that made sense.....All these days i thought i was going crazy (thought about OCD as well)... ADHD, masking and chronic people pleaser while talking negatively about my self, is making my anxiety worse and causes burnout. I ignored the signs (i was super angry, impetiant , tired ect so my body tried to protect me this time. All these years my body was screaming at me to stop. So i want your thoughts and advise. Im still struggling today but now the hours of clarity are longer and im not spiralling all day. I want to learn to live a normal life and not burn myself out again so i can have steady energy all year long. And my finals are in about 2 months and this is stressing me out more cause cause my focus is so much worse now... So its like ADHD and anxiety - burnout- panic attacks. Thank you for listening to me and sorry for the mistakes. Im practising grounding, mindfulness and stopped drinking coffee, im trying to sleep more and eat better. I feel like this time i should get out of my burnout like all these years and then try to shift into healthier living and thinking so this doesnt happen again.

The job market’s rough, people are tired, and most “networking” stuff honestly makes me want to disappear into the floor.

A few of us in Toronto are trying something small and different: a Speed Coffee Chat, not a loud networking event, not a panel, not a “pitch yourself in 30 seconds” thing, currently we have 10 people.

The idea is really simple:  
you show up, grab a coffee, and have short, low-pressure conversations with people who are also just… figuring things out.

We’re doing it with a kind of *blind box* twist, you don’t start with job titles or company names. You get little prompts and clues instead, and you slowly discover shared interests, similar experiences, or totally different perspectives. It makes the conversations feel way more human and way less performative.

We’re hosting the first one **6PM to 730PM Jan 8, 2026, downtown Toronto** (exact spot will be shared privately). It’s a small group, coffee-based, early evening. There *is* a ticket just to keep numbers manageable, but we kept it low.

I’m also genuinely curious:  
Would something like this actually help you right now? Or what kind of event *would* feel helpful?

This chronologically happend before Nao's Liquor store, but it was the same day. We decided to have this as a brunch, which is usually my least favorite word in the english language, but this definitely made up for it. There is a very big garden behind it that you can buy entry for that was very worth it. It's unfortunately not Flying Witch related per se, but I have a lot of beautiful pictures back there including some actually decent ones of me, as supposed to the ones that I have posted :/

That aside, the cafe has a decently limited menu, but everything on there was very good! Two of us got the Apple Beef Curry, and they both gave raving reviews. I got the pasta with meatsauce, that was a little basic, but overall still great. We all got some cakes which were very rich and delicious. The other mod of the sub may have gotten addicted to coffee here.

Unfortunately, we were one table away from where Makoto, Chinatsu, and Kei sat (where mask emoji is), but maybe next time I'll luck out with it. I did, however, do a very poorly drawn magic circle and ask a (very cute) waitress if she would be okay with me taking a picture of her stepping on it. She was pretty thrown off when I told her the angle. After the picture, my friends asked me how I explained the context to her.... I uh.. didn't.

She even had the decency to try and invite herself around my other sisters K house (21y) and making her host for Christmas, but she was barely getting by with all the gifts she had for other people especially gifts for her other half’s family. However during this my other sister H was being up tight and judgmental and K ended up being kicked into the coffee table by K and I had to step up and defuse the situation while being drunk. But this year J had recently had my nephew that she’s been gatekeeping from me, she’s posted all of my other siblings holding him and hasn’t even invited me to come over to see him for the first time. I also heard from K that J and H have been talking crap about how me and K might be autistic (I’m on the list to be checked out by the doctor for this) but also how we’re both childish like we didn’t even get the chance to be children ourselves and also been talking about my youngest half sis and how she’s being sassy and that she’s being bratty, she also is mentally stunted but has come along way and she’s 14, I see that as being a teenager and if they did find it rude they could politely call her out and explain why she’s being rude. 

Now the context is out of the way I politely asked to come over for Christmas and see my nephew for the first time for Christmas as I have no where else to go and my fiancée has said that I could come over for half of the day for Christmas but not for the full day he’s 17 and soon turning 18 and he’s also in care (btw I’m 18) and he’s also received a lot of backlash from J and has been denied from contact with my younger sis that was really excited to meet him for the first time, I don’t know why I went to her to ask because it was for my younger siblings and they all seem to be fine with him being there, however Js partner was very much allowed to meet my younger siblings without any notice or explanation to my younger siblings, my fiancé is DBS checked as he’s worked with kids in the past and very much knows how they work and how to act around them. I was thinking of just getting wasted at the end of Christmas Day and try to forget about them, K has said that she would host but is again struggling with finances, I just feel like I’m a burden to my family and I’m struggling with how or why I am. They never reach out and they expect me to go and talk to them but every time I do I get shut down. 

Sorry I’m just ranting at this point and I don’t know what to do I don’t want to spend Christmas alone when I’m just 18 and I wish this whole thing would end.",2,1765740435.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

**Mistakes Were Made**

It was late on the fourth day when we approached the Toll Bridge crossing the Oakhaven River. We decided to cross the river and call Sanctuary somewhere on the other side.

That was when fifteen or so armed men approached us.

The leader, a tall man dressed in leather armor and carrying a two-handed broadsword, spoke in a rough, deep voice. ""What a motley crew. The toll to reach the bridge is one copper for you, and two for each of the non-humans. Now, if you can't pay, we can take something in trade.""

""We're not paying your extortion. The toll is at the bridge, not before. Now why don't you stop trying to extort people and get honest jobs?"" I said.

I could see the pebbles on the cobblestone road already dancing. Skia hadn't changed yet. Nyla shifted her body weight, imperceptibly to anyone who didn't know her, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. I remained relaxed, holding *Chain Breaker* like a walking stick. I knew from behind - even though I couldn't see them - Sweet and Medusa had stopped holding hands, and Medusa was preparing to pull her bow.

""Honest jobs? Extortion? I think he's calling us bandits, boys."" The leader laughed, a cruel laugh. His men laughed as well, then he yelled, ""Get them!""

Four arrows flew overhead before the men were able to build momentum. I wondered at the angle; Medusa must have climbed up some sort of pillar I hadn't paid attention to.

I had too much to worry about as the leader charged me, swinging his two-handed sword. I brought *Chain Breaker* down and caught his sword between the axe head and spear point. A quick flick of my wrist pulled the sword from his hand. I kicked him in the stomach, sending him back into the crowd.

Nyla kicked into a man, using the momentum to slice another one clean in two. I spun around bringing *Chain Breaker* in an arc, cutting through a man with the axe head, the spear tip slicing the one behind him.

It was then I realized why the arrows were coming in from so high. Medusa had climbed onto the shoulders of Sweet, who gutted a man with her claws as Medusa let arrows fly in an endless rain, bracing herself in Sweet's antlers.

Skia, head fully transformed now, was shaking the leader - who I had lost track of - in her jaws like a dog shaking a ragdoll. The rest of the men who weren't dead were running away.

Two minutes, maybe. The victory was decisively ours.

**The Legend Begins**

Catching my breath, I looked around at the carnage. Twelve men lay dead, but it looked like a couple of them were split in half. None of us were injured. Skia was looking at the fleeing men like she wanted to give chase.

""Skia, let them go,"" I said, then noticed that there was a bunch of people on the hills overlooking the road. They were pointing; I couldn't hear them, but they were obviously talking about what just happened.

""Nyla, Skia, Sweet, Medusa - we need to move. We've got an audience. We still need to get to the other side of the river and find a secluded place,"" I said as I took Nyla's hand, leading everyone away.

**Thanks**

We slept that night, and slept in the next day, trying to keep off the road as much as possible so as not to attract more attention. That was when a small group of people hollered and waved at us. You could hear them yell, ""It's them, it's them!""

A crowd of people started coming in our direction. Everyone grouped up, prepared for an attack. It was then I noticed there were children in the group approaching us.

""Wait, they're not attacking,"" I said, confused.

We all relaxed a bit. The people stopped just before us. An older gentleman stepped forward. ""I'm Trnear. We wanted to thank you. You dealt with those men, the ones terrorizing the road.""

Trnear and the people - some of whom were the ones on the hill - explained that those men had been terrorizing the travelers. They wouldn't hit the big groups, the ones who could defend themselves, but would attack the small groups, the individuals, and families.

They insisted on thanking us. We explained there was no need; after all, we were simply defending ourselves. Trnear insisted we at least share their noonday meal.

We continued on our way after sharing the meal. The road turned from cobbled to dirt, with deep grooves from years of wagons rolling over it.

**Slave Train**

We continued until we saw the back of the caravan.
""People in cages. They're slavers."" My blood ran cold. I'd never imagined such a long caravan, and not a single one appeared to be anything but slaves and slavers.

Nyla, in a hushed tone, said, ""There must be two hundred people locked up in those cages.""

""We need a plan. It's not just about freeing them; we have to get them home,"" I reminded our little family.

Sweet looked at the map we had copied from the living map in Sanctuary's library. ""If we move along the ridge here,"" she said, pointing at the map, ""we can get ahead of them without being seen.""

Medusa interjected. ""Then we can attack them from this choke point in the hills.""

Sweet smiled at her sister. ""Exactly. If we time it right, they'll never see us coming.""

**Breaking Chains**

We got in front of the caravan before nightfall. Medusa found a cleft in the rocks she could fire from without exposing herself. Nyla and Skia, using their ability to hide, took positions on either side of the road, while Sweet and I stood further back in the middle of the road. The hills and rocks made it impossible to go around us.

As the caravan approached, the lead wagon's guard stood up with a crossbow pointed at us. He died before he could pull the trigger, as Medusa put an arrow through his neck. The driver screamed as the four of us attacked.

Many of the guards were completely caught off guard. I saw Skia in her shadow form hit a wagon of guards and flip it on its side. I reached the first caged wagon and snapped the chains, letting the former slaves free. Men poured out.

""Take up arms from the dead slavers and help us free the rest!"" I yelled as I continued breaking chains.

One of the guards lunged for me. Using *Chain Breaker*, I blocked the thrust from his sword, but not before he caught my chainmail shirt, pulling it to the side and exposing the old scar from the brand. There was a look of recognition in his eyes. That hesitation cost him as I hit him in the head with the shaft of *Chain Breaker*.

With the help of the freed slaves, we routed the enemy in no time. Only a few escaped - including the one who recognized the brand.

**Escort**

After our raid, we escorted the former captives back towards the borderlands where they had been taken from. The slavers seemed to be going further out to find slaves to import.

As we approached the borderlands, we stayed back, watching as the former slave wagons pulled toward the town. Even from our vantage point, we could see the joyful reunions. We then headed back towards Silk City, and our destiny.

I’m 25, from India, 5'8, brown-skinned with brown eyes, and I work in IT sector. I’m more into calm evenings than loud nights. I don’t smoke or drink, I’m Christian (faith matters to me), and I really value respect, honesty, and consistency.

I’m introverted at first - the “awkward until comfortable” type - but once I open up, I’m chatty, loyal, and genuinely invested. I’m not into games or drama. I like connections that build slowly and feel steady.

Most days end with coffee, soft music, and a show I’m probably over-analyzing 😅. I love anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. Music is a big thing for me - late-night playlists, random song sharing, and finding tracks that just hit.

I enjoy cooking simple meals, quiet walks, hiking, stargazing, museums, cafés, and calm weekends at home. I still play Genshin once in a while. I love travel - Japan and Switzerland are dream places - but I’m equally happy staying in and talking about life.

I’m looking for someone kind, emotionally open, and steady. Long distance is okay if both people actually try. If it feels right, I’m open to closing the gap.

If this sounds like your vibe, message me with your age, where you’re from, and one song you’ve been looping lately.

Whether you’re nestled in the rural beauty of Oroville or living closer to the heart of Chico, fences in Butte County serve more than one purpose. From securing pets to adding a layer of privacy or increasing your home’s resale value, smart fence design and placement can do wonders for your property.

**1. Privacy That Feels Like Peace**

Let’s face it—nobody wants neighbors peeking into their backyard BBQ or morning coffee rituals. A well-designed privacy fence turns your outdoor space into a secluded oasis. Wood fences are a classic option, offering a natural look that blends perfectly with Butte County’s scenic backdrop. If you're after low maintenance, vinyl might be your go-to. Either way, a solid privacy fence can make your backyard feel like your own private retreat.

**2. Pet Safety Without Sacrificing Style**

We love our pets like family—and they deserve a safe, secure yard to roam freely. A sturdy fence keeps dogs in and unwelcome critters out. Chain-link or wooden fences are both pet-friendly options. For smaller pets, consider adding dig guards or closer slats to prevent escape artists from slipping through. A good fence doesn’t just keep your pets safe—it also helps reduce barking caused by outside distractions.

**3. Property Value That Pays Off**

Good fences do more than make good neighbors—they make good investments. A quality fence can boost your property’s value and make it more attractive to buyers. It’s not just about aesthetics; it's about functionality and lifestyle. A home with a secure yard is appealing to families with children or pets, and privacy features are always a bonus. Fencing is one of those improvements that offers long-term returns while giving you everyday benefits.

**4. Choose Materials That Match Your Needs**

Think about your goals—privacy, aesthetics, durability, or budget—and pick a material that aligns. Wood adds warmth and charm, while vinyl offers easy maintenance. Chain-link is cost-effective and perfect for pet containment. Want to blend in with nature? Consider composite or horizontal slatted styles for a more modern, clean look.

**Butte County construction services** often help homeowners bring their fencing visions to life with practical advice tailored to the local climate and terrain. Whether you're in the hills or on flat ground, the right service can help you choose materials and designs that are both functional and beautiful.

With the right fence, your outdoor space transforms into a private, safe, and valuable part of your home.",1,1765740212.0,InfiniteContent,0,1.0,False

I’m 29F, engaged and happily living with my partner. Not planning to have kids. I live in East Vancouver and would love to meet a few like-minded people, ideally with the hope of forming a small friend group over time rather than one-off hangouts.

I’m very much a homebody at heart and enjoy cozy nights in with movies, TV series, and good food - though unfortunately my place isn’t an option for hosting. I’m still very up for hanging out elsewhere and exploring new restaurants from time to time, especially dim sum (which honestly is just better with a bigger group). Long-term dream would be to have a group of friends who can play Mahjong together at someone’s place.

A bit about me:
- Huge anime fan
- Love TV series (currently waiting for Stranger Things final season to be fully out before starting)
- Massive dog lover
- Not outdoorsy (yes, I moved to Vancouver anyway)
- I do enjoy a weekly beginner-level dance class at Harbour Dance Centre downtown — not good at it, just there to move a bit, and would love company if anyone’s interested
- Don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t go clubbing
- Not into coffee or sweets, but I do love matcha and boba
- Not very experienced with board games, but open to learning
- Also down for karaoke

I’m mainly looking for people who are happy just hanging out, chatting, eating good food, watching things together, and slowly building a comfortable friendship - no pressure, no party scene.

I got obsessed with what we *don’t* talk about: the food.

This video project started with a simple question: **what did steak and beans actually mean in an 1870s Deadwood saloon?** I ended up following three threads at once:

* **Beans** as the quiet backbone of frontier life (ration lists, commissary records, “free lunch” saloon culture)
* **Beef** as money on hooves – cattle drives, railroads, status on a plate
* And the **“invisible cook”** in the back room, a woman standing over heat and smoke while newspapers later turned the day into a legend about men, cards, and a gunshot

In the video I tell the story through a fictionalized but historically grounded cook, **María Ortega**, working in a Deadwood saloon kitchen on August 2nd, 1876. While the front room is all poker and noise, she’s quietly simmering pinto beans with molasses, chili, and a splash of coffee (a real frontier trick), and searing a cast-iron ribeye for a regular named… Wild Bill.

Then I jump into a modern adaptation of that **1876 saloon steak & beans**:  
slow-cooked pinto beans with coffee and molasses + cast-iron steak with a dark crust, plated together the way a Deadwood saloon might have served it.

If the mods are okay with it, I’ve put the full video link in the first comment.

Little did I know that there are much more things to life than that. I was overwhelmed with thoughts and didn’t talk about it with her like a grown adult should, I broke up, and when she asked why I couldn’t mumble a single word, just said „I’m sorry” a couple times. Three days later, after a long weekend of mixed thoughts, we talked at last. We were sincere and honest and decided to try to fix things up. Then, after 4 days she told me that she can’t get back to how things used to be before right now and can’t feel romantic towards me. Basically told me she loves ma as a person but isn’t able to love me more (friendzone type shit). And I respect that, if someone told me that I’m not right for them and few days later told me that he/she loves me I would be a little torn and afriad od trusting them again to say the least.

We built something real (I think). I confessed my feelings… and now she’s gone quiet.","Hi Reddit — this has been weighing heavily on me, and I need perspective from anyone who’s been in a similar situation, especially from women in their 40s or 50s.

I’m a 39-year-old man. I’m married, father of 3, but in a very strained, emotionally disconnected marriage. I won’t go into that now — this post isn’t about justifying that. It’s about a connection I’ve formed with someone else. A woman who’s shaken me to my core.

She’s 50. A pediatrician. Smart, elegant, composed, independent. She’s also a single mom of twin boys, caught up in a difficult, ongoing custody and legal battle with her ex. She’s been through hell — and still shows up to the world with kindness and resilience.

We met through our kids (they go to the same activities), and over the past year we’ve built a connection. It started with casual chats when our kids were around… but slowly, we began sharing coffees just the two of us. Then came longer conversations, laughs, inside jokes, light touches. She began calling me πιπίνι (a playful Greek nickname meaning “younger guy”). There was something unspoken building between us.

Eventually, we shared a breakfast — just the two of us. We split an omelette. It was the first time we were alone. We talked about everything — her court stress, summer plans, even taking the kids skiing together. She also floated the idea of future trips together — even spending Christmas in Finland with the kids. That didn’t feel casual. That felt… shared life energy.

I started falling. Hard.

And I know the moment she caught my full attention: a summer event at our kids’ school. She was sitting in front of me, and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I knew from that moment I wanted her in my life. That she was… different. Grounded. Real.

So after months of this building up, I wrote her a letter — handwritten, emotional, real. I told her how much I think about her every day. How I’d rather see her for 1 minute daily than wait 2 months in silence. I said that I deeply admire her as a person, that I care for her kids, and that I genuinely want a future with her. Not just fun. Something meaningful. Even if that future is uncertain.

When I gave it to her — she was at home, one of her sons had a fever. I showed up with medicine (I didn’t want to text some “feel better” line — I wanted to act). She came out in her pajamas, looked exhausted, but still warm. I handed her the medicine and the letter. She hugged me. Kissed me on the cheek. Said we’d text the next day to meet again.

That was a few days ago.

Since then, barely a word.

She thanked me for the gesture.

She responded kindly to a playful message I sent.

But… I feel distance. A strange, polite wall.

Now I’m stuck in this limbo.

I keep wondering:

•	Did I go too far?

•	Did I scare her?

•	Was she only ever just enjoying some warm companionship — not knowing I felt something much deeper?

•	Or is she also feeling things but terrified to go there — because of her ex, her kids, her age, my situation?

I can’t stop thinking about her. I’m not obsessed with the idea of “having her” — I genuinely want to know how she feels. I want connection. Truth. Closure, if nothing else.

But she’s not making a move. Not even acknowledging the letter. And I don’t know if I should wait in respect… or if her silence is the answer.

⸻

Has anyone experienced something like this?

Especially women in their 40s or 50s:

•	What would you feel if a younger man confessed something this heartfelt to you?

•	Would you be scared?

•	Would you need time?

•	Or would you pull away if you didn’t feel the same?

And men — have you ever made a move like this and been met with silence?

Any honest thoughts are welcome. I’m not here to be judged for the emotional complexity of my situation. Just trying to understand if this is something real… or something I built up too much in my head.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR:

I (M39, married but emotionally distant) formed a deep connection with a 50-year-old doctor (F50), single mom of twins. Our friendship grew into something emotionally intense — future plans, shared moments, a growing closeness. I confessed my feelings in a handwritten letter. She thanked me, but since then she’s gone quiet. I’m stuck wondering: did I misread everything, or is she just scared?

Disclosure:

This post was written with the help of ChatGPT to help me organize a long and emotional story into something clearer and more readable. All the experiences and emotions are real — I just needed a little structure to express them.

Edit:

Just to add some real context because I know how black-and-white this might look from the outside:

Over the past 9 months, I’ve shown up for her in quiet, intentional ways:

    •	On her birthday in February, I anonymously sent her a box of Belgian chocolates to her workplace, with a note saying she has the most beautiful smile on the planet. No name, I revealed myself two weeks later, she smiled and hugged me and kissed on the cheek
    
    •	Back in September, I brought her a handmade Swiss coffee mug — one for her, one for me — and on the bottom of each, we wrote a small dedication to each other. She told me that this would be her morning coffee mug from now on, as she didn’t have one specifically 
    
    •	In November, I brought her a handmade Peruvian wool hat that I had picked specifically to match her blond hair. It was chosen with care and she told me she would wear it during her trip to France and wear it.

Yes, I’m married. I’m not hiding that. And I understand how bad that looks. But I’m not leading her on for fun or attention. I’m trying to figure out something complex and emotionally heavy — with someone who I care for deeply during the past year and can’t take it anymore.

My question here is: Has she been emotionally invested too? Or was this all just one-sided hope from my end?",0,1765739077.0,relationships,17,0.2,False

1pmm055,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pmm055/sf_utopia/,[SF] Utopia,"“The problem is that the promised dystopia never arrived.” Neil snorted, switched off the TV and called out again for Milo. “The problem most definitely seemed to be that Milo was an ungrateful brat”, he said out loud to the TV, mocking the candidate’s posh British accent and nasal voice. A few more whacks of Milo’s food bowl did nothing. Neil finally gave up and decided Milo was out of earshot and will show up when he does. Peering out of the window for the past ten minutes had done nothing to improve Neil’s mood. There was a time when a bright fall morning over a calm lake Chautauqua would have brightened his mood, or so he believed anyway.

The pain from his hip surgery didn’t help. At 98, very few things had any right to help. At his age, a new hip felt like nothing more than a fuck you to mother nature. But young John had been convincing in a way only a 25-year-old with a septum piercing could be. He probably got a commission for adding more miserable years to Neil’s life. The whole generation was too cheery, Neil had decided one slightly drunken evening, Milo had seemed to agree. But he was a cat and was near old enough to be a century old in cat years himself.

Settling on his deck with a cup of coffee and his diary, he started to think about what year to record next. As grumpy as he had woken up, this part of his day always helped. John didn’t know what ‘a Netflix’ was but he was trained well enough in “social wellness management” to know crusty old men liked reminiscing. Flipping through the pages, decades really, he realized he had left too little space for the 2050s. The section for that decade was already almost full but he always felt a need to add more there. Neil knew deep down he felt the world was extremely wrong. John would say that is a natural reaction to change, but the 50s were long enough ago that Neil was never convinced. Now instead of writing he felt himself getting sucked into reading his own words. Some, almost fading now - he had penned them down so long ago. God, he was getting old.

2052 could be a novel by itself but Neil’s entries for the year started in November. This was his diary, and all he had written about was getting arrested at a protest. John knew that at some point, and more worryingly even now, he agreed with the idiot on TV. When he was sitting in the holding cell on the day described in his diary, he was convinced the dystopia had already arrived. An AI president. The world had collectively lost their minds. Neil was convinced that Big Brother was finally real. Soon he would be drinking an ideal meal through a straw and be put in a hole for thought crimes.

It was unnerving how little had changed the next day when he got bailed out. The world seemed to basically go on. Clippy was a terrible name for an AI, worse for people who remembered the laughable original. But it was named when it was designed to be a bureaucrat. Clippy had just worked too well. No there weren’t mass arrests or robot armies shooting up cities; Mr. Schwarzenegger, god rest his soul, never needed to come back from the future. No, mankind had brewed up a perfect, endless energy source in the form of fusion reactors and a tireless selfreplicating AI worker, put them together and somehow, against all odds, survived to tell the tale.

Lost in his thoughts, Neil's mind wandered back to the days when the world had begun to pivot on its axis, reshaped by the invisible hands of AI. He recalled the uneasy transition at his workplace, a chapter in his life he had scribbled down in his diary with a mix of bewilderment and resignation. It was a time when 'strategic workforce optimization' had echoed through the corridors, a corporate euphemism that thinly veiled the reality of layoffs. Neil, along with his colleagues, had been ushered out, albeit with a severance that was generously disproportionate – a pension nearly double his salary. As he reflected, he couldn't help but chuckle at the irony; the AI, a cousin or perhaps even an early version of Clippy, had brought about efficiencies unimaginable to the human workforce. He had penned down, almost admiringly, how it not only streamlined operations but also birthed innovative ideas. In those moments of reflection, Neil felt like an artifact from a different era, one where human judgment and skill had their place.

His thoughts drifted further, meandering through the broader changes that swept through society, a narrative that he had captured in fragmented diary entries. The nationalization of major corporations, a shift seismic enough to make the free-market giants obsolete. The implementation of universal basic income, transforming from a fringe concept to a societal cornerstone. Neil had jotted down his observations with a sense of awe and incredulity. The world had changed faster than Neil could comprehend. People no longer worked for survival; they worked for fulfillment, or most didn’t work at all. There was almost too much on offer – a lottery system to have a moon holiday, spas at the bottom of the ocean, pristine nature preserves with animals plucked from the annals of extinction, and even a new resort on Mars. All paid for and available to choose from for everyone in the country. Somewhere in his diary, buried in the early 70s, Neil had written about feeling like at the end of a Thanksgiving meal. Greed and gluttony seemed to have been replaced with this feeling of being overstuffed and just wanting to have a nap.

The coffee had gone cold. There was no writing coming today. Neil stood up, cursed at the shooting pain in his hip, and walked back in to get his phone. It was almost time. No, it was past time. His manually wound watch, a relic almost as old as him, had been losing time. Another reminder of the past and it’s inefficiencies. Picking up his phone, he tapped on the notification.

Billions of people across the governed territories would be doing the same at this time in their timezone. They would be clicking on this notification, most not even reading the text of what they were voting for. And collectively they would, in overwhelming numbers that would have seemed absurd in the elections of Neil's youth, cast their vote in favor of continuing Clippy's governance. Neil would vote yes too. As much as he complained, mostly to himself, he did like the idea of watching the century turn again. Young John had rubbed off on him more than he wanted to accept. And his new hip will hurt a lot less next month, especially on his two week stay on the moon.

The flap in the door rattled as Milo finally deigned it time to return. No gifts today thankfully. Neil gave him a scratch behind the ear, straightened up with more curses and went to fill Milo’s bowl with food. The world would keep chugging along and all Neil really felt like doing at the moment was to keep Milo fed and warm, ungrateful as the cat was. Thankfully, he did always return, and Neil pretended it was for him and not the food. “What would you even do without me” Neil said as he set down Milo’s bowl, “I really do pamper you too much.”",1,1765738972.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We’re living in the peak era of dopamine overload. The culprits? TikTok loops, endless YouTube shorts, the dopamine drip from instant DMs and Reddit karma hits. But here’s the thing: it’s not just social media. It’s how we’ve rewired our brain’s reward system without even realizing it.

I dug into research from neuroscientists, behavioral psychologists, and science-backed recovery protocols. I also sifted through a lot of toxic advice from unqualified influencers preaching dopamine “detoxes” that are either unrealistic or biologically inaccurate. So here’s a post grounded in actual neuroscience with practical tools for sustainable recovery. These are habits and tools that actually help reset your neurochemistry, not some cold-turkey fantasy challenge.

Here’s your go-to guide to rebalancing dopamine, rebuilding real motivation and pleasure, and finally feeling like yourself again.

---

- Try the “60-minute rule” from Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman  
  - In his podcast Huberman Lab, he explains the importance of giving your brain low-stimulation windows to recalibrate.  
  - Set aside 60 minutes a day with ZERO dopamine-stimulating inputs.  
    - No phones  
    - No music  
    - No podcasts or screens  
    - Just sit, walk, write, or rest  
  - This simple practice, done daily, forces your baseline dopamine level to reset, which then makes normal activities feel rewarding again.  
  - Evidence-backed: A 2021 study in Nature Neuroscience found that reducing reward-driven inputs for short periods significantly improved baseline motivation and focus.

- Use “delayed reward stacking” to retrain your brain’s reward system  
  - Dr. Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation and chief of Stanford's dual diagnosis addiction clinic, explains that the brain builds tolerance with frequent small rewards.  
  - Solution? Delay gratification.  
    - Work deeply for 45-60 minutes  
    - Then take a short rewarding break (stretch, sip coffee, check phone)
    - This rhythm rebuilds your natural dopamine cycles  
  - Studies show that individuals using this “effort first, reward after” model report longer attention spans and lower emotional reactivity.

- Replace passive digital inputs with active level-1 novelty  
  - Dopamine loves novelty, but not all novelty is bad.  
  - Instead of mindlessly scrolling, teach your brain to crave active novelty:  
    - Try chess puzzles on lichess.org  
    - Learn one new chord on a ukulele  
    - Cook a new 3-ingredient recipe  
  - According to research published in Psychological Science, novelty that involves active engagement increases long-term learning and dopamine stability.

- Use this app to practice “dopamine fasting” rituals  
  - Try the app Othership (iOS/Android) for breathwork sessions designed to calm the nervous system and reset dopamine sensitivity  
    - Created by neuroscientists and mental health experts  
    - Has short 3 to 15-minute sessions that simulate ""mini detox"" resets  
    - Users report feeling grounded, less overstimulated, and more present  
  - Works especially well in the evening or after high-stimulation days

- Use this AI-powered self-growth app for tailored dopamine resets  
  - BeFreed is an AI-powered self-growth app built by a team from Columbia University and Google. It turns top book insights, expert podcasts, and research papers into personalized audio pods that match your brain’s learning style.  
  - You can customize the length and depth of each episode from a 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive and choose from voices like calm, smoky, or sarcastic to match your mood.  
  - Its “Focus Mode” builds an adaptive learning plan based on your goals and even lets you chat with a virtual coach avatar to get content that fits your current struggles.  
  - It’s helped me replace doomscrolling with real learning and made my mind feel clearer and more focused in just a few days. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.

- Rewire your dopamine via the “boring habit method”  
  - Choose one boring but healthy activity (e.g., 20-minute morning walk)  
  - Repeat at the same time daily for 21–30 days  
  - The brain begins to associate calm, low-effort tasks with reward  
  - Evidence: A group study in Germany found dopamine receptors upregulated after routine exposure to low-stimulation tasks over three weeks (Journal of Neuroscience, 2019)

Dopamine isn’t evil. Short videos aren’t ruining society. But chronic overstimulation is wrecking our internal reward balance. You don’t need to delete your apps or become a monk. You just need to retrain your brain to find reward in reality again.

Try one of these tools. Stick to it for a week. See how you feel.

There was this lady and she'd come in often. Sometimes with her partner or her friends and even on her own sometimes. She used to give the biggest tips. She'd always ask to be served by me if I was working. She'd get me sit down and chat. She'd ask mostly about me. Where I grew up etc.

One day, she rang me. Apparently she my boss gave her my number and they gave it. She said she'd like to offer me a job. I was curious so we went to a cafe \[coffee shop\] and she said she'd like me to be her house's houseboy. She explained it to me.

One minute I'm making my morning coffee, and the next, it feels like I'm moving through molasses, the world around me blurry and uncertain. Mental illness isn't always a loud, noticeable thing. It's sometimes quiet, and lurking, and it changes the most mundane moments into uphill challenges.

I remember last Tuesday particularly well. It was a normal morning, not much out of the ordinary. The sound of the city beginning to wake up seeped through my apartment windows. I stood in my kitchen, sunlight pouring in, cutting up an apple. It should have been a peaceful moment, but it was as though a cloud descended. Suddenly, it felt immensely difficult to continue, to finish preparing my breakfast, to brace for the outside world. 

The cloud lifted eventually, but I was left feeling shaken. That's the thing about mental illness; it doesn't care about when or where or how it enters.

I (41F) live with my parents (86M, 75F).  Dad has vascular dementia.  I work full time outside of the home.  We have tried our best to keep Dad going.  He attends programming three times a week. We let him do things he is still able to do.  He enjoys reading, doing puzzles, listening to music.  He also enjoys walking, doing some light exercise and doing household chores like dishes and laundry.  However is unable to prepare meals, drive and apply logic in his daily life.  He gets confused easily and tends to get anxious when things / people are not in their place / home at normal time, etc.  

I had a blow up with dad last week. He had been left at home for not long while mom went to the store and I was at work. When I returned home I discovered he had been outdoors trying to clear the front step of snow / ice.  We live in a condo and this is provided by a company.  It had been -10°C that day and freezing rain.  It was not safe for Dad to be outdoors.  We’ve explained many times to him the risk of a fall and winter conditions.  He attends exercise classes to help with fall prevention and is provided with educational resources about that.  He has had one fall before and received stitches on his head and a CT scan. 

I was upset with him when I found out this is what he had done in a sneaky way while mom was out at the store.  I went over all the safety protocols, why this is important, etc.  Dad just sat there and said I can do what I want. 

Since then I have only spoken to him to respond to basic questions. I have not gone out of my way to help him with anything. I have not taken him on any outings this weekend (we typically go to the local farmers market, an indoor walking track or out for coffee).

I had a 6 month bowel obstruction which resulted in me getting 8 inches of my TI removed along with my appendix and cecum. For 4-5 weeks after surgery, I had PERFECT BM’s. As soon as my first period after surgery started, I started dealing with chronic diarrhea. I got pregnant that cycle as well but lost it at 5 weeks. Then in September I got pregnant again so I’m currently 15 weeks. Been dealing with mostly diarrhea the whole time other than when I was consistent with psyllium husk which I’ve now basically stopped. I’ve been eating more fiber as well like well soaked and cooked beans to help bind to hormones and what not.

1pmlmc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pmlmc2/2_weeks_in_spain_an_indepth_review/,2 weeks in Spain: An in-depth review,"33M from Los Angeles, CA. I visited Spain for the first time in October 2025 on a 2-week trip. I traveled solo for half the trip and with a friend from high school the other half.

I stayed in the following cities, traveling by train and bus in between:

**Barcelona** (3 nights, El Born) – Loved it here! The cityscape is beautiful with the mountains, ocean, and various architectural styles (especially Modernista). The vibe here is both energized and laidback. It is very easy to get around.

* **Highlights:** Sagrada Família (it really lives up to the hype), Palace of Catalan Music, Picasso Museum, Montjuïc, Block of Discord, Torre Gloríes, Barcelona Cathedral, Park Güell

**Madrid** (5 nights, Sol) – This is where I met up with my friend. The vibe here is very stately, with large crowds milling about. It’s surprisingly quiet outside the center though. We visited during the National Day of Spain, so there were performances around town celebrating the unique music and dance traditions from throughout the Hispanic world.

* **Highlights:** Almudena Cathedral, Royal Palace, Gran Vía, Prado (Francisco Goya paintings), National Day celebrations
* **Day Trip: Toledo** – All sorts of interesting pockets to explore in the winding streets of this medieval city. We really enjoyed the Cathedral, a [guided tour](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g187489-d27736485-Guided_English_walking_tour_to_the_monuments_of_Toledo-Toledo_Province_of_Toledo_C.html) of the city, and the Manchego Cheese Museum. The Mirador del Valle is stunning. I wish we’d had more time here.

**Granada** (3 nights, Realejo-San Matias) – My favorite city, hands-down. The Alhambra is one of the most incredible places I’ve visited. The Zambra flamenco [performance](https://cuevalosamayas.com/?idcp=2XMD6&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21098202190&gbraid=0AAAAA9SMGDfE49u50TOuZ7ejwu9Q5iiKK&gclid=CjwKCAiAxc_JBhA2EiwAFVs7XBS8czhyiXUvt8Shc0jAdjG3hT08sIauwnioeutfrZ95W4bQwCrFhRoCi3EQAvD_BwE) we attended was also excellent. The city’s small size and rich history make it a fascinating place to wander, and an active student population makes for an interesting contrast with the tourist crowds. This was the last place my friend and I went together before parting ways.

* **Highlights:** Alhambra, flamenco, Albaicín neighborhood, Royal Chapel, Granada Cathedral

**Sevilla** (3 nights, Santa Justa) – A mix of regal grandeur and convivial charm. It’s very pretty here, with a variety of sights within a walkable touristic core. Unexpectedly, tons more American tourists here than other cities.

* **Highlights:** Plaza de España, Sevilla Cathedral, Royal Alcázar, Maestranza Bullring, Torre del Oro, Triana neighborhood, Setas de Sevilla, Basílica de la Macarena

**Food & Drink:**

* My favorite tapas combo was acorn-fed jamón ibérico with spinach and chickpeas.
* 6-month-aged Manchego cheese is to die for.
* Favorite beverage was Tinto de Verano.
* Favorite dessert was tarta de almendras. We had a chocolate variant from [Hey My Coffee - Sol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EVBAoTAAjGmwNZT3A) in Madrid. It was so good; my friend returned for more on a later day.
* Another good sweet treat is a lemon slushie topped with vanilla ice cream.
* I prefer porras to churros. Both are surprisingly savory.
* Paprika-seasoned olives (orange in color) are delicious.
* The Taquito Lupita with caramel sauce is a highlight of Spanish Taco Bell.

**Language:**

* This was tough. On previous trips, learning a few key phrases in the local language has usually been enough. But even having prepared before this trip, I struggled to be understood in Spanish (and Catalan in Barcelona). English also doesn’t seem as widely spoken in Spain as it is in France, Germany, or Italy. Most Spanish people were kind about my language limitations, but I got more quizzical looks and corrections here than I have elsewhere. I was grateful for my Spanish-speaking friend’s assistance when he was around.
* That said, I did manage to have a delightful 20-minute conversation with a friendly old Spanish man who barely spoke English in Madrid. Don’t let the language barrier stop you.

**General Thoughts:**

* I had a lot of fun traveling with my friend! We’ve known each other for years and communicated well, despite having different interests and rhythms. He found great activities I might not have sought out on my own, and he was really proactive about connecting with the locals. I encourage any other solo travelers to try travel with a friend.
* Weather was perfect. No rain, mostly sunny, mid-70s ℉ pretty much everywhere except Sevilla (mid-80s ℉). Locals said it was a bit warm for October.
* I felt very safe in Spain. No issues with pickpockets. Didn’t run into scammers as much as I have elsewhere.
* Do the vendors selling knock-off purses and soccer jerseys on sheets actually make money? I never once saw anyone browsing their wares.
* The character Stitch is shockingly popular. My friend and I saw so many Stitches that we joked he’s Spain’s official mascot.
* Spanish men seem to have more piercings than men in other countries.
* I appreciate how easy bathroom access in Spain is and how clean bathrooms are generally.
* For some reason though, hand dryers in Spanish bathrooms are often unplugged or don’t work.
* The system for boarding trains between cities is more complicated than in other countries and seems to create delayed departures.
* This is a broader Europe observation, but “Shallow” by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper might be the most-covered song by street musicians.
* The Spanish landscape is spectacular. Lots of plateaus and forests on my flight in. Some neat rock formations in Catalunya and Andalucía.

**Tips:**

* Casa Batlló in Barcelona has color-coded ticket tiers (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum). The colors’ functions change between day and night. I bought the Silver pass for a night viewing, thinking I’d get roof access. But I didn’t find out till the end of my visit that Silver roof access is only during the day. The house is cool, but I found the night experience overpriced and not worth the money ($40).
* If traveling between Madrid and Toledo, book train tickets in advance. We tried to book the day before, but all the morning trains were full. The Alsa bus got us there, but it’s a longer journey and boarding took a while.
* The Alhambra is huge; a guided tour will help you navigate and understand the history. We had an excellent guide through [Granada Tourismo y Ocio](https://granadaturismoyocio.com/visita-alhambra-entradas-incluidas/).
* Pretty much everywhere took credit cards. There was one porras shop in Granada that took cash only, so have a bit ready just in case.

**Budget:**

* Total: $4,050
   * Flights: $920 via Iberia / Level (LAX to BCN, direct; SVQ to LAX, layover in MAD)
   * Hotels: $1770 (Barcelona most expensive, Granada most affordable)
   * Train/Bus Tickets Between Cities: $180
   * Daily Expenses: $1180 (food & drink, sight admissions, Metro/local bus fares, etc.)

**Closing Thoughts:**

Spain is a very accessible country with good weather, neat history, beautiful architecture, lovely landscapes, and friendly people. I’d happily return someday to explore places like Valencia, Santiago de Compostela, Basque Country, etc. To any Spanish folks reading this, thank you for making an American feel welcome!

But, currently, it faces a myriad of problems that prevent it from becoming the idyll of liberty and dreams that the revolution once envisioned, not limited to:

\-**Natural disasters,** like the 1953 earthquake followed by the 1954 destruction orchestrated by Hurricane Hazel, if the civilian loss wasn't enough, an estimated 20% to 40% of the vital coffee and cacao crops revenue of the state evaporated like nothing. The national budget was consequently cut, and government workers took a 10% salary reduction. The country faced an $8 to $9 million shortfall in estimated revenues, leading to a major financial crisis and the need for significant foreign aid from its partners at Washington.

\-**Subversive elements,** from part of the misled rural populations exploited by extremist agitators who whisper of 'land redistribution', and more revolutionary lies, shielded by the juvenile PPLN, who seek to advance the short-lived legacy of figures like Estimé and take it further.  
The military isn't safe from these, as some individuals have entangled themselves with the ill-fated idea of 'noirisme'(a movement whose legitimate cultural aspirations have been hijacked by cynical opportunists). And, within the wider macrocosm, a sizeable amount of the populace support it, rallied under the guidance of a marginal figure exploiting uncertainty currently hiding in the countryside to avoid arrest, while not physically relevant as of now, this example is just one of many that showcase just how much the state needs to use all its cards to bring (back) sorely needed stability to Haiti, including the restoration of constitutional order and public security within the full scope of sovereign authority.

\-**The rabid pancake makeup-wearing dictator** that once assassinated Ayiti's people in cold blood over sugar and is currently leading an entire nation in the most hypocritical way possible. Tormenting the national psyche and eager to sacrifice thousands for his 'whitening' programs. In the name of peace, Haiti will continue to uphold peace as its biggest absolute principle, but should the boogeyman come back again to inflict pain on the Haitian people, the wrath of the mother will respond swiftly.

\-**And more.**

I had a Greyhound ticket to leave at **1:00 pm** and come by **3:00 pm**. I was at the correct station **20 minutes early**, but the bus never came. It was listed on the screen and then disappeared. I called customer service and waited **16 minutes** with no response, so I gave up.

Because I had a coffee chat in NYC, I immediately bought **another ticket** so I could still go. I made it to NYC, but I intentionally skipped my **7:00 pm** return ticket.

Later that night, I bought a **9:30 pm** ticket, but I went to the wrong station. The driver told me I could swap it through customer service, but customer service never responded.

Out of options, I bought another ticket for **11:59 pm**, listed with a weird name like **“Niagara Falls”** going to Philly on FlixBus through Greyhound. That bus was shown as ""**scheduled"" on the station display**, but it never arrived. When the time passed, it stayed on the screen for about 15 minutes and then just disappeared. And it was snowing :(

At that point I had no choice and bought **another last minute ticket for almost $60**, and only then was I able to get home.

Today I called Greyhound again, waited **20 minutes**, finally reached an agent, explained everything, and then they transferred me to **customer feedback**, where I’m now stuck again.

I paid for multiple trips that either never showed up or couldn’t be fixed because customer service was unreachable.

1pmlimz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pmlimz/the_barn_is_starting_to_smell_rotten/,The Barn is starting to smell rotten,"I'm a freshly graduated college student, with a fancy and proper degree in Agricultural science, heading back to support my family with new ideas and statistically backed theories.See, my family has a large ranch in the rolling plains of Arkansas. It's about 70 acres of fertile fields, green but kept trimmed. The far edge of the property fades into something dead and yellow, frayed branches like they'd been on fire years ago. Me and my cousins always dared each other to go beyond our familiar fields as kids, growing more bold as we got older, but never crossing the threshold.

That was forever ago, before I left them to become the first in my family with a degree. We've always had a tight-knit bond, a farm family cliche, generations living under one roof. I had met  my grandfather at the local airport, an almost entirely wooden structure hidden up in the mountains. With a rolling suitcase sliding behind me, I searched the few reuniting families in the arrival section, my eyes landing on him. It had only been four years since I'd seen him last, but farmers don't exactly age gracefully. What I mean is- the sun and experience weighed down on his face, making his eyes sink into his cheeks, wrinkled yet hollow. His skin was like leather, tanned and thick enough to dull a nail. Whisps of gray hair attempted to bridge the gaps on his scalp, like desperately holding back my family's curse of balding.

Still, it was Grandpa Harvey. Even with the years showing on his face, below those sunken eyes was a typical tight-lipped smile, happy to see me. I jogged awkwardly to his side, where he placed his hand on my shoulder with a few stiff pats.

""Good to see you, boy."" His voice drawled, loud and thick, trained from his life of calling cattle and barking orders.

""How's the family? Still.. farmy?"" I replied awkwardly, offering a thrawn smile, feeling a little distant despite weekly telephone calls with updates on how business and family were going. Southerners have a way of making you feel real welcome, while excluding you from some inside situation you couldn't puzzle together- and I was feeling more of the ladder.

""Yaw, what else would we be up to?"" He chortled loudly. I could feel the vibrato in his voice from the proximity. I kept my smile as he guided my shoulder by his bony hand, dappled with freckles and sunspots. 

He was a lot skinnier than he had been, no longer plump from living off the land- his bones rattled when he walked with an unsteady gait. I couldn't help but cringe slightly as he stifled a wheeze when we descended the stairs into the lobby entrance. We exited the building into warm, summer weather, welcoming and stuffy with humidity. The higher the elevation, the more the air seemed to weigh on your lungs, like swimming deeper into a pool. 

I didn't mind it, it was home- regardless if others considered it uncomfortable. Grandpa Harvey raised a finger, pointing at a group of well-dressed business men and cackling at the sweat beading their thin brows and high cheekbones. 

I stepped onto the sunken lip of his large red pickup, hoisting myself up onto the crackling vinyl seat. He took to the driver side, a bout of a coughing fit obstructing his attempt to turn the engine over. 

It wasn't unusual to watch an older man crumple under his age- but it still felt wrong. The four years I'd been gone seemed to have accelerated his age by decades.

My concern was quickly chased away as he began driving down the mountainside, the old beatup truck rumbling over the road that descended to the valley. The years had melted away instantly as he cracked jokes and shared his gripes of old age. He got in some jabs about how, despite his age, he could still wrestle down our bulls and stallions better than any man younger.

""People now are soft. Wouldn't know a willow from a sycamore."" He claimed, with that elderly confidence you couldn't help but admire.

""But we have ideas."" I cut in, leaning my forearm on the rolled down window, soaking in the southern breeze as it whipped through my hair. He looked over for a moment, pursing his lips as if considering to argue. He looked warmer in the sunlight of the valley. Maybe it was the airport, with its sterile lights, that made him look so gaunt. He must've decided not to argue, because he waited a long moment before he spoke next.

""You must've learned a lot from schooling. I expect you'll be teaching us now, on how we're going about it all wrong."" His words were bitter, like part of him resented me for wanting to take a different path. This was dangerous, when someone older than you set a trap like this. It was a sort of bait, daring you to confirm your doubts, or express that what they interpreted was wrong. I chose the safe option, changing the subject.

""It was good. I think I can really help out now. Before, I wasn't all that useful."" I chose my words carefully, knowing the self depreciation would make him consider my opinions.

I was a skinny bastard, gangly and awkward in a family of sturdy and broad farmers. I even remember losing a wrestling match with my thirteen year old cousin, as a twenty-something year old man. My cheeks flushed slightly at the recollection, earning a jab to my shoulder, snapping me out of my thoughts.

""We're here. Welcome back home, son."" 

The doors creaked as we got out, the rusty metal trim groaning with age. The expanse of our ranch greeted me like an old friend, slightly withered. Dense thickets shadowed where proud stalks once grew. The weather had been especially dry lately, like the clouds had gotten tired of raining. It wasn't surprising- Arkansas weather often had arid summers. A record high temperature was 115⁰, back when I was a kid. The crops that year died before they could shake the winter frost.

I took a deep breath, the fresh air making my nostrils sting pleasantly. Nothing had changed much, the land stretched infinitely just as before, ending unceremoniously into the dead woods miles away, crooked trees like bones in the distance. The big red and gray barns parallel to the large ranch house were sagging from strong winds, but they still stood proud, albeit faded. An expanding horse pasture adjacent to the gray barn was occupied by gangly, scrawny mustangs. I recognized a few, we've had some since I was born. Their spines jutted from their summer coats, their skin stretched tightly and thin over their bony frames. They nosed through the tall grass, tan muzzles blending in with the sickly ferns as they searched for food.

I followed my grandfather through the winding, hoofbeaten path to the house. He climbed the wooden steps, one at a time, pausing after each one and drawing in a thick breath of air. I pulled my suitcase up over the steps after he had gotten up to the wide porch. I was thankful I hardly had luggage- I think any more weight would cause the unreliable steps to splinter and give way to the dry dirt below. 

The door swung open, the person I had missed most hurrying onto the unsteady wood to pull me into her arms. 

""Oh! Oh, you're here! You're here with us!"" Cried my mother, her honey blonde curls of hair bouncing as she squeezed and swayed me in her arms. 

""It was only a few years, mam."" I flushed slightly, trying not to melt into her warm embrace and freckled skin. A few squeaky voices barked greetings, the bright blue and green eyes of my cousins peeking from the house. I was the oldest, and I could see the pride in their eyes- someone bigger than them had accomplished something, even if they didn't understand what. 

""Can a mother miss her boy? Oh, those years took decades!"" She cried once more, her hazel eyes wet with tears of relief that I had made it back. 

I never understood mother's, they treated anytime you went out like it was some death defying mission you may not come back from. But still, it was nice to know I had been kept in their thoughts. She went on about how they had prayed and missed me at the dinner table, rambling over herself before I could speak. 

Harvey took the handle of my suitcase in his thin hand before I could argue, herding me into the house behind my mother. 

The next few hours felt warm, comfortable. I had almost forgotten about my questions about the farm until we all sat at the dinner table. Me, a dozen cousins, my mother, and my grandfather. Conversation started out casually, my mother asked how college had been, if I'd been eating well. I answered everything with a ""Yes'm."" or a ""No mam."" I noticed missing seats at the table, and I interrupted myself mid college anecdote.

""Aunt Sarah, Uncle Smith. Are they in town?"" I gestured towards the empty chairs, my words muffled around a spoon full of shepherd's pie.

The excited chatter of the room dimmed down, until all eyes were on me. The youngest of the cousins, 6 and 8, kept talking, until they were hushed with a stroke on the head and a stern look.

My grandfather was the only one who didn't look up. His pools of dark blue eyes were trained on his plate as he chewed quietly on his food, like a cow focusing on digesting cud. My mother gave him a knowing smile, her soft and pink hand resting upon his. Her thumb stroked his bony knuckles.

""Now, that isn't something to worry about. They're around here somewhere."" Her words were smooth and carefully chosen. She spoke like she was comforting a kid over a dead goldfish- not quite lying, not admitting truth. It was just sleeping, floating on its back at the surface.

I sensed how thick the air had become, and I nodded instead of prying further. My aunt and uncle always took their time, making sure the animals were fed and put up before night. They must have been leading the horses back into their barn. The pasture became dangerous at night- coyotes and other nocturnal hunters had scaled the fences before, and they'd gone after the years foals or calves before, too. Keeping the animals up was the most responsible course of action- and they cared about the animals a great deal.

Dinner resumed after my mother reassured me, but it was quieter than before, like we were all dancing around my questions. Another southern thing was a sort of hush that followed after someone said something they shouldn't have. Everyone was too stern to be vulnerable, so we left it alone. 

My mother put the younger kids to bed that night, without the help of my aunt. They were rowdy and bubbling with questions for me, but she managed to bribe them with promises of extra pie before bed. The large house was quiet now, the main cause of noise finally settled for the night.

She emerged once more, closing the wooden door of a bedroom behind her softly. She padded over to me, her body hugged by a silky blush colored robe. I was sitting at the table still, across from my grandfather as we soaked in the comfortable silence together. He nursed a beer, tapping his fingers against the glass as I studied the darkening land through the kitchen window. The barns seemed ominous now, looming over the pastures and casting great shadows on the dry grass. The entire land seemed withered. I knew it was full of life, a dozen horses, chickens and cows slept in their stalls- but it all felt empty, like a graveyard in the winter.

She joined us at the table, a sad smile on her face as she studied me and stroked my hair absentmindedly. We remained quiet, until the sound of a wooden chair scraping over the floor startled us. Harvey got up to his unsteady feet, his beer forgotten. His face seemed sunken in the dim kitchen light.

""I'm turnin’ in. Welcome back, Mason.” He touched my shoulder meaningfully, his gaze like he was looking within me, not at me. He lingered for a moment, until I made eye contact, and then he smiled in his tight way and strode down the hallway, to the last door on the wall. It unsettled me, how empty his eyes were. I waited until I heard it close behind him, until I looked at my mom with a silent urgency.

“Sarah n’ Smith still isn't in..” I started, watching my mother's face fall, her grip tightening on my hair for a moment painfully, until she stepped aside. She paused, looking out of the window with her back to me, hands clasped behind her. I swallowed thickly, waiting for a reply as I set my hair back in place.

“It'll be okay.” She said, in a hurried whisper. For a second, in the moonlight dappled reflection, I swear I could see tears. I was pushing her past a level of numbness she must've learned while I was away. And I kept going.

“And pa. He isn't right either. He's skinny. And the horses, too. I saw a lame mare collapse under her own weight. The crops don't look good. The grass is yellow.” I kept going, listing everything I'd noticed in the short time I was back. Once the last word had left my mouth, I knew I should've let it be.

“Mason.” 

She stopped me before I went farther. Her voice was sharp, scolding. I looked up to see her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks now. She was shaking with something between fury and sorrow. Then her voice shook like the Earth before a storm.

“Do not let them hear you.” She whispered, wiping her eyes until they were raw. She sniffled, replacing her frown with a forced smile to ease the sudden fear I felt. 

“Mason.” She repeated, squeezing my shoulder. “Get some sleep and we can find something nice to do tomorrow. Maybe we can saddle up a horse and take the trails.” Her voice was wavering, her lips shaking from a smile to a frown. 

“That's a good idea, mam.” 

Once I gave a satisfying response, she released my shoulder and walked off, looking once over her shoulder to me with something unreadable, before disappearing down the hall.

I felt uneasy, like something big was hanging over the farm, and everyone could see it but me. 

I counted it up to being lingering jetlag from my earlier flight out of college, a long travel time from Texas. Home always looks different after a long trip, afterall. 

I got into bed, a shared room toward the back of the house with a bunk bed and one normal cot. Two of my older cousins slept on the bunk, and I took the larger bed. The mattress was soft and I sunk into it, my back cradled by the comfortable foam. There was a space between the beds, where a large window sat on the wall, underneath it a small end table with books and paper stacked on it. The moonlight showed a grid on the wooden floor, keeping me awake. In college, my dorm was completely dark with black out curtains, I hadn't had light when sleeping in awhile.

It was very quiet, I could hear my own breathing and the soft snoring of my cousins across the room. A cricket chirped rhythmically for a moment, and then stopped. I counted five chirps, hoping it would maybe lull me to sleep. 

At some point, my eyes were too heavy to keep open, and I fell into a light and restless sleep. It didn't last long, when I woke in the middle of the night, the moon was still just as high in the sky. I tore the quilt off of my legs, deciding I could use some fresh air, and the sealed window wasn't providing it.

I walked slowly and methodically, remembering the least creaky steps to take in order to let everyone else sleep. I made it out quietly, bare feet stepping onto the cool wooden porch. The air was warm and dry, with a cool breeze sifting through. I took a deep breath, welcoming the sweet wind into my lungs.

I smelled something other than the cool night air and grass. Something sweet and wrong, like rotten apples. I didn't bother to slip on boots- the land was too dry and dusty for me to consider it. It's not like I would step in any mud. I stepped down from the porch, and my feet kicked up a small cloud of dust as I walked. The ground was dry and my footsteps hardly made a sound.

Even in the dark, I knew my way to the big, peeling red barn. I could walk the path deaf blind or dazed. I reached the large doors, slightly ajar. The smell was worse now. It assaulted my nose, made my eyes water and my sinuses tingle. It was the kind of sweet, putrid smell that you wanted to huff more of, just to figure out the source. Like old meat.

I pushed open the door with a deafening creak- and what I saw next- I still see when I close my eyes. Flies and other insects who fed on rot scattered at the sudden moonlight, darting past me. I swatted them away frantically, stepping forward as my stomach gurgled.

 I found Aunt Sarah.

What was left of her. The face down body of a woman, wearing a long pleated skirt and work shirt. I would recognize the outfit anywhere- she always wore it when working outside. Her blonde hair was a matted mess on the back of her head. Something between muck and blood oozed beneath her, a rich brown and red color that caked the straw bedding of the floor. It spread through and touched my bare feet with a sickening slosh, like stepping in a mud puddle. She was rotten, for weeks by the smell of it. Her arm stretched out beneath her, the flesh was wrinkled and thin, with flies scattering to pick it over

I couldn't breath, couldn't blink, couldn't move. The next part happened so fast. Something lurched in the darkness, like something wet being dragged across grass. It would pause, then continue. I took one step back, the gore squishing between my toes. It got closer, faster and more determined. I saw a hand sticking out of a familiar flannel sleeve, the tan and thick hand of my uncle, calloused from working the land. The fingers bent, digging into the straw for grip and using the leverage to pull his body further. He wasn't alive. But he moved. He moved like a parasite was controlling him, not like a zombie. He wasn't aware, I could tell. I could tell by the vacant look in his eyes, glazed over and almost entirely white. His mouth hung open, collecting straw as he was dragged.

I remembered something like this- a fungus that possessed ants to exist without consciousness. Like it was something determined, not sure of what. Something hungry.

A scream caught in my throat, something strangled and burning. My feet finally moved without my brain's permission, taking me out of the barn. They pounded against the Earth, taking me back to the house as I continued my guttural wail. I clambered up the porch and shoved the door open, my feet staining the wooden floor. I didn't look back, but I could still hear the wet dragging.

My mother must've heard the sudden commotion, because she emerged from her room, her eyes sullen and too indifferent. I couldn't find the right words, so I just banged my fist on the door frame, pointing outside to the barn. 

She walked forward, slow calm strides that made my stomach turn upside-down. 

“Mason. Were you out with Aunt Sarah and Uncle Smith?” She asked, pursing her lips, almost accusatory.

My words came out fast and hurried. “Mom! They- they're dead. They're dead and they didn't stay dead!”

She put a hand on my shoulder, turning me away from my nightmares, facing the kitchen window. She turned my head with her soft hand on my cheek, making me look out of it, to the woods stretching beyond.

“Mason. The woods are hungry. They've gotten real restless since you've been gone.” She sucked in her cheeks, her hand tightening on my arm. The woods did seem darker than before, like they were eating up our green land and turning it yellow and black. Dead. 

“What?” I asked in a whisper, like I was afraid to know the answer.

The answer came quietly, over the next few hours. She sat with me at the table. She had started a pot of coffee before she sat down, now holding a warm mug between her hands. I had been holding my breath the entire time, but I was grateful the scent of death was replaced with bitter coffee. 

“Now, that's better.” She muttered quietly to herself, taking a noisy sip of the coffee. “I guess it all started the day you left. We were happy for you, but sad. And we didn't keep up our duty.”

“Duty?” 

“Yes, boy. I know you're a smart boy, you've noticed the woods ever since you were young.” She put her hand over mine and rubbed her thumb over it in a gesture of comfort. “You noticed how they stretch out and reach for you. They're a living thing, in a decayed way. They get hungry. We feed them, whatever weak animals we get during spring. In exchange, we get to live off the land.”

I nodded despite not understanding any of it.

This was her sign to continue. “It's been a real dry season. We haven't had much crops to sell, much cows having calves. It's been.. incessant. It stopped taking the weak stillborn foals, and started feeding off our mares. Then the stallions. Then our bulls. And it still wasn't enough..” She paused, letting me fill in the blanks. That explained what happened to her brother and sister.

“That's why grandpa looks so sick.” I assumed, and she nodded gravely.

“Thats right. He's been working over time, trying to save the animals from the sickness. So much so it's got him sick himself.” She looked at me then, and I felt my stomach drop.

“Your cousins are too young to understand. But we're putting them up, somewhere else that's safe. I'll be going with them up North. Your grandfather is sick, Mason. The farm is sick.” She leaned forward, and her tone became pleading.

“You're strong, smart, a real survivor..Like your grandfather. Please, Mason. Please stay and fight the darkness. Feed it. Keep it at bay.”

It was quiet after that. I thought for an eternity, replied in a few seconds.

“I'll keep it away, mom.”

The years went by fast, after I had been tasked with something so heavy. My mother took the youngest of my cousins and moved up North to a small town home, like she said. The older ones went off on their own to school, inspired by my own journey. Grandpa Harvey passed away a few years back, peacefully in his sleep. When the weight was off his shoulders.

And me? Well, I'm in my fifties now. I had my own family with a woman who understood what my duty was. Had kids who had their own kids. I even had a grandson who agreed to take my place.

I got a fancy laptop this Christmas, and my grandkids introduced me to this site, said I should write my story.

I'm sitting on the porch now, the computer in my lap as I type. The woods beyond crept closer by the day, but I kept them in check. I have a cigarette in my lips, my eyes on them. I take a drag as something dark drags the body of a stillborn foal out of sight.",1,1765737814.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pmleq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PelvicFloor/comments/1pmleq6/20m_constipated_2_months_and_suspecting/,[20M] Constipated 2 months and suspecting hypertonic pelvic floor,"I'm anxious and stressed from trying to stop this constipation for so long so I can't write this coherently.

I can't tell if I do or dont have pelvic floor dysfunction (hypertonic) because my gastroenterologist won't help me and I have 2.5 months until next appointment unless someone cancels theirs. My clinic is not letting me see another doctor. And the proctologist and urologist I saw dismissed checking me for pelvic floor dysfunction or referring me to someone who can.

TLDR: i can't get BMs currently. I have pressure in the low abdomen and tailbone/cocyx area. After sitting on the toilet and doing diaphragm breathing for 3 minutes I also feel pressure in the asshole itself (or deeper inside it seems).

I doing squats for 30s, tried happy baby, knees to chest while laying down. Only diaphragm breathing helps me when I'm trying not to strain and already have diarrhea from bisacodyl pills or soft stool from Peg 3350 powder, but its incomplete evacuation with Peg.

By every 3rd day of not having a BM I have to use a gliceryn suppository because I have a hard time urinating (it's delayed by 20-30 minutes from when I actually want to pee).

I used to get pain and heaviness in the testicles. Sometimes I get pressure in my areas on my crotch, and always when I tilt my pelvis upwards there's pressure all across my crotch.

I did ultrasound for testicles and for the crotch and did a colonsocpy and it was said they're all OK.

3 weeks ago proctologist said I had an anal fissure and external hemmoroids. I checked last week with a proctologist and he said I don't have those but I still feel like a paper or a small knife cuts me in the asshole several times a day (this doctor tried to dismiss me the entire time). 10 days before that I had a hemmoroid stuck outside even 20 hours after a BM and I had to find out what sitz bath is on my own to get it back inside.

My situation:
1. used to have regular daily BM, then painful BMs that made me bleed with BMs becoming harder to get and required straining to get out. This was for about 10 days.
2. Saw a proctologist that told me to eat fiber powder and using nifedipine+lidocaine for an anal fissure he told me i have. improved BMs frequency temporarily but pain and blood stayed. This lasted for about 10-14 days, and I only insight realized I had hemmoroids pooping out of me everytime i had a BM. The proctologist didn't bother tell me anything about straining or that hemmoroids get WORSE over time if you strain.
3. got pain in testicles suddenly -> fiber powder no longer helps -> resorted to using gliceryn suppository every 3rd day to get a BM because i 0 urge, and I was feeling a lot of pressure in the cocyx/tailbone area. The pressure gets worse if I eat more fiber and by the 3rd day I have a hard time peeing (it's delayed by 20-30 minutes before I manage to urinate), and by that time I always force myself to use a suppository.

The pain in my testicles was gone afrer 10 days, and only heaviness remained for up until the time I started my colonsocpy bowel prep (which was 4 days ago). I believe it was referred pain due to constipation.

I will note that I tried increasing fiber in increments, I tried 35 gram daily fiber, tried to eat 5/7/15/20 prunes in 1 day, tried magnesium oxide, tried lactulose, tried olive oil, tried tea, tried coffee, etc.

4. I saw my gastroenterologist after 1 month and she said to do a colonsocpy, said she'll give me a better powder. Turns out she just gave powder for bowel prep for the colonsocpy and ignored me telling her about the pressure I feel and the straining and being forced supptories to get BMs.

5. I wait for my colonsocpy date, and while doing that I am forced to continue straining not knowing it's bad. I tried to up my fiber intake again, it worked for once and I had again a painful BM. I tried 35 gram of fiber again and I can't go up, next day I have 2 urges to go but I make my hemmoroids so bad they stay out. For 20 hours they were out, until I googled sitz bath and took one and it made my hemmoroids go in.

Before I had the hemmoroid pop out, another proctologist told me I have external hemmoroids, but he neglected to tell me not to strain on the toilet.

6. I googled it and found Normalax in my country (peg 3350 like miralax) powder, I tried it and after 5 days it still didn't give me a BM, but when I used the suppository on the 3rd day 2 huge stools came out when I tried to force myself to not strain as much as possible. I still felt like I had more stool inside me but it was ""cut"".

For the next 2 days I had daily BMs, minimal or really no straining. But it's all partial partial BMs, sometimes I have an urge to get another piece 2-3 hours later.

7. 4 days later I had to start my bowel prep for the colonsocpy. People said that the powder sachet and the bisacodyl pills they had to take made them sit on the toilet for hours. For me, even with diarrhea, it took me hours before I managed to get them. I always feel pressure in the lower abdomen, gurgling, and pressure in the tailbone.

8. Did the colonsocpy, they didn't find a problem there.
9. 4 days after colonsocpy, and only had a tiny BM the day after the colonsocpy. I feel pressure in lower abdomen and tailbone again. For now I pass gas, once I get almost no gas out and I'll have trouble urinating or the pressure becomes too much ill take a gliceryn suppository again. I took Normalax today to try to soften my stool to hopefully make it easier to get out.

I want to note I always have a lot of stool when I use a suppository, and when I try not to strain I can't get everything out.

Also, when I tilt my hips upward,  feel a lot of tension in my lower abdomen.",1,1765737554.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

But I can’t bring myself to serve the papers. I’ve consulted with an attorney, a fertility specialist (I’m late 30s and would eventually like to have another child), and I think to myself how if we didn’t have a toddler right now it, this would be a lot easier for me. I’m financially independent and I think the only thing that’s holding me back is our child and selfishly not wanting to share custody. At the same time, I’m starting to have passive suicidal ideation, and then I stop myself and remember that I do have a child whom I love so deeply and need to be there for, regardless of how shitty my husband treats me. I genuinely believe my depression and anxiety got 1000x worse because of him- yet I still don’t have it in me to pull the trigger and serve the damn papers. I also know I can’t live the rest of my life with someone who’s so hot and cold with me, one day being sweet and civil and the next day yelling at me and ignoring me for days after because I spilled my coffee, or I forgot a minor detail of something he said (he doesn’t like repeating himself). 

So for those of you who really struggled to just do it, what was your tipping point?

All of your insights and recommendations helped me create the perfect itinerary to guide the flow of our vacation. We loved Freeform coffee! & the Hudson was incredible. Major shoutout to Mystical Bazaar for doing squeezing us in for aura pics. We especially loved Indian Garden Cafe it was the perfect post hike lunch spot, and I found an incredible orange wine there. We did the Boynton vortex trail & the Deadmans pass into the birthing cave - it was absolutely incredible!!! The pink jeep tour through broken arrow was so fun it felt like time flew by! Sunset at airport mesa wasn’t as packed as I feared, and dinner at mesa grill was delicious! Overall though the best moments were just soaking in that magical Sedona Magic. I loved the cozy nights at the airbnb. We stayed at “Luxury Uptown Retreat with Panoramic Views” Casey’s place was awesome. The indoor fireplace had the perfect view of the rising of the full moon. It was my favorite moment. The place had a location that felt secluded, but was super close by to uptown.

1pml51r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1pml51r/bland_food_should_be_embraced_by_people_trying_to/,Bland food should be embraced by people trying to lose weight.,"I've lost 80lbs+ by sticking to a mostly ""bland"" diet of unseasoned meats, vegetables, fruits and grains. This is after years upon years of failed yo-yo dieting. 

I believe embracing bland food has a few advantages. Especially after a month or so on a bland diet when your mind gets more used to it. 

1. After an adjustment period you stop associating food with pleasure. It becomes a means to an end to fuel yourself rather than means to get pleasure. 

2. It saves a ton of time thinking about prepping, cooking and fussing over meals. You just cut up veggies or eat them raw. Boiling potatoes and cooking meat is dead simple, no fuss required.

3. Related to point #2, you stop associating meal prep with a stressful chore. It makes it easier not to slip up and order high calorie takeout or prepare easy to make but ultimately bad food, especially after a stressful day at work, college, etc.. 

4. You can engage in other positive activities while or directly after eating to make up for the ""blandness"". This increases the pleasure of those activities over the pleasure of the food!
For example, I started doing logic puzzles on my phone while eating my bland eggs and oatmeal for breakfast while sipping on black coffee. I play piano, and started making a habit of playing right after supper every night, my brain now associates practicing the piano with evening pleasure, not food. 

5. It's easier to listen to your bodies natural signals that you're full when you're not obsessed with how good the shit you're shoving in your body tastes or doesn't taste. If you feel full, there's not another part you screaming to keep eating because it ""tastes so good""!

6. You start to enjoy and notice the flavors in ""bland"" food. As it turns out, different types of plain potatoes have different flavors, they don't all taste like seasoning! Fresh unseasoned vegetables taste amazing when you're not being constantly bombarded with other spices and added flavors. It's amazing how my palate changed to notice these things. 

7. It drastically increases the pleasure of very seasoned food when you do eat it on OCCASION, thus allowing you to derive more pleasure from less food. It's hard not to binge at first, but I find cutting food into small morsels and eating it slowly lets you actually savor it. Seasoning becomes a treat, not the rule. 

The whole diet industry seems so focused on trying to make things ""taste good"" for people. People struggle with their weight, often because they're addicted to the pleasure they get from eating food.The solution sold to people is to keep finding pleasure in food but in a ""healthy"" way that often takes a lot more effort and leaves the door wide open to fall back into old bad habits. Why not just accept that day to day food doesn't need to be tasty and derive pleasure from more productive fulfilling things?",20,1765736881.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,11,0.89,False

then I saw an instagram story from my at the time friend na magkasama sila mg ex ko, so naturally, I replied with “di nag aaya?” the response I got was “busy ka kasi eh ayaw namin makaistorbo”. so tumaas na kaagad kilay ko kasi hindi naman mahirap magiwan ng message eh diba? kahit na alam kong busy friends ko I make it a point to at least leave a message pag may ganap kahit na malaki yung chance na hindi sila makakasama. eh kasi nga busy sa thesis + work, the confrontation ended there. then it became more frequent, casual coffee sa malapit na big brew slowly turned into late night drives with my ex being invited by my “friends” and me being an afterthought. I considered cutting my friends off when we eventually got together (with my ex as well) and ang dami nilang inside jokes and yung line na “sayang, gusto sana namin na andon ka” hello? edi sana nagmessage kayo? may gc naman? punyeta eh. 

so I talked to my ex about it. minention ko na gusto ko na sila icut off. the conversation I had with my ex got shared to my “friends” in one of their hangouts na hindi ako kasama, and ultimately, I looked like an asshole. naturally, ang tanong nila eh “bakit naman ganon”. so I explained, and then it got worse but I ultimately pushed it aside kasi nga thesis + working student. 

then came the break up. malamang dun sila sa ex ko kumampi and then I got painted as the villain. at this point I didn’t really care anymore and I buried myself in all the task I needed to do. 

my “friends” have been trying to reach me recently. now, I’m all for reconciliation and not burning bridges, but they already made it clear to me that they had their mind made up. so I ignored them. 

nakaka putangina lang kasi I’m out here minding my own business and trying to further my career and here they are acting as if completely innocent sila. punyeta sila.

After replacing the peak temp sensor and tearing down the whole unit and chasing every wire looking for a short, realized that the Arc Fault breaker just wasn’t designed for supporting a high draw dual boiler machine and replaced it with a traditional breaker and all has been well.

This pairs two movies that are wildly different from each other so you can watch them back to back and see how they make you think about them. Some very successful double features I've watched:

Pulp Fiction/Moulin Rouge!  
Rat Race/Escape from New York  
Office Space/The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

I have to say, Pulp Fiction and Moulin Rouge! are actually really fun back to back. The grim, gritty and simple story telling from Pulp Fiction clashes with but also makes Moulin Rouge! really shine. The irony and campiness of Rat Race with the seriousness of Escape from New York does something similar. It's like the idea of adding coffee to chocolate - the bitterness makes the sweetness pop and that much more satisfying. The Office Space/The Life Aquatic was kind of a weird exception but makes the dry humor in both come through.

1pmkuef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1pmkuef/how_much_time_do_you_spend_actively_interacting/,How much time do you spend actively interacting with your kids as a stay at home parent?,"I am really struggling with the level of interaction my oldest child requires from me and the entire family. I've been a sahm since he was born (may 2026) and spending every day with me is all he knows. Here we are 3+ years later, he thinks family time is all the time and we should all be happy together 24/7 😬 he wakes up first thing in the morning (used to be 4:30, luckily now 6 is sleeping in) ready to be actively engaged and yet won't take the lead. I will be bundled in a blanket with my coffee barely alive to the world and he's asking me what should we do... and spends the entire rest of the day asking ""what's next?"" almost... incapable? of choosing to do anything for himself during free time. He literally just sits there and waits for me to be ready. When my gears finally start turning and I give a stab at imitating a play session, it almost always turns to shit. He runs through my play promts in 10 seconds like a box to tick off, just stares at me waiting for the next one. Never gets bored, never ever in his life walks away to do his own thing. He has a 2 year old sister that even gets tired of him and tells him to go away, and he only directs like 25% of his attention on her - if I'm unavailable mostly 🫠 to try and sum it up.... As a family, we cannot get him to figure out that time at home is simply \*free time\* i tell him do whatever you want! He has free access to playdoh, basic arts and craft supplies, a toy room (that i even rotate our toys to keep it interesting), a dress up rack. We go on a walk or errand together almost every day. I always offer him to join my tasks if appropriate. we definitely do play together! We build castles, forts, play with characters, do puzzles... he wants his entire day to be social and if possible he would connect his brain to mine and have me control him like a video game. I started writing this last night after a difficult day, got tired and gave up. It's 10am next day and the whole family is about to have a breakdown because he won't just find something to do, because it's fun to have something to do 🤷🏼‍♀️ genuinely he will not find something for himself to do of his own choosing, ever. I think it goes without saying but we are obviously a screen time monitoring family - he could spend hours watching a show he doesn't even like and never tear himself away from the tv. No tablets ever. Me and my husband model alone time by saying we need to take breaks, laying down to read a book, working on a personal project. He is completely capable of playing alone and can do so for almost an hour if we force it, but still doesn't understand that when alone time is over that doesn't mean we suddenly have to be actively engaged with each other all the time. He really wants social stimulation just all the time. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I love my child deeply and taking a lot of solace in knowing I am his comfort. However I'm also deeply antisocial and really just trying to figure out how to balance what is good for both of us 😩 for all of us! I am genuinely so curious what other stay at home days look like for people. What are we doing with the vast amount of time in a day? How much time do you play with your kids? How do you model independent time? ",1,1765736148.0,Parenting,14,0.6,False

1pmktyp,https://v.redd.it/2d33edf3m77g1,Real time dtw recording and data storage ml resolution -,"since it’s snowing these days- I decided to continue on with an old project that I’ve been slowly working with. decided to at least share it for what it’s worth.

  
i know hpa operators have a set way in which they like to run their equipment. there are times i just let a system fly and other times i like to be extremely aware of data. sometimes I set spray cycles for a once and done from beginning to end, other times i adjust as needed. 

  
when I did make this first one back in 19’ and then in 20’ it did not have this resolution that it does now, beginning prototypes were much looser with resolution and timing. 

  
having the means to real time and hourly have values, I was able to incorporate that into my spray cycle for automation against slow transpiration increases, or drastic increases and decreases against day and night photosynthesis rate changes when I was trying to maintain a constant dtw ml output .

  
some of my systems worked just well as a set it and forget it,others loved constant attention depending on what I was doing.

  
this little prototype here, connects all the possibilities together. 

since winter is full swing, and coffee is still affordable- I think it’s time I design and package this into a one unit instead of wires everywhere. 

  
does something like this have any value in the real world, to hobby minded? labs? or do I just have too much time on my hands 😂 ",1,1765736121.0,aeroponics,0,1.0,False
