1kmy02d,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1kmy02d/echoes_part_1/,Echoes (Part 1),"Me and some compatriots are studying the night sky and trying to find out what lies beyond our universe. We just recently had a new telescope built on a very small remote island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean named Otok‚Äîwell, at least that's what we call it. Not sure if it has a real name. Not a big island, only a few buildings for the inhabitants‚Äîme and three other coworkers: Atlas, Leo, and Luna.

Luna: ""Are you gonna write in that journal all day or are you gonna actually do some work?""

Me: ""Oh, like you're doing‚Äîsitting over there watching YouTube videos and eating chips. Hahaha.""

Luna: ""Hey, come on now. Ain't much else I can do. Atlas is always hogging the scope nowadays.""

Atlas: ""I just feel like there's an area in the void that we‚Äôre missing. This new telescope is supposed to be ten times stronger than the Hubble, and it still seems to show complete black. How can a void truly be that dark?""

Leo: ""Well, it seems to be a pocket that never had anything develop in it. So as the universe expands, the void just gets bigger and bigger.""

Atlas: ""It just doesn't feel right. It‚Äôs like something in the back of my mind keeps telling me to scan it.""

Me: ""Why don't you give it a break for the night and let Luna or me look? A fresh set of eyes never hurt.""

Atlas: ""Yeah, you're probably right. I'm gonna go get a snack and maybe take a nap.""

Luna excitedly jumps up and runs over. ""Finally, some time alone with my new baby.""

She slid into the chair, cracked her knuckles, and brought the telescope controls up on screen. I was still scribbling in my journal when I noticed her pause.

She leaned forward, head tilted like she was trying to catch something just out of range.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Did you hear that?‚Äù she asked softly.

I looked up. ""Hear what?""

She scanned the room‚Äîjust us, the quiet hum of the electronics.

‚ÄúIt sounded like‚Ä¶ a whisper. Faint. Came from the headset, I think, but we‚Äôve got all the mics muted, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, everything‚Äôs off.‚Äù

She gave a nervous chuckle. ‚ÄúWeird. Probably just interference or something.‚Äù

But the way her hands lingered over the controls, stiff and hesitant, said she didn‚Äôt believe that. She stayed quiet after that, hyperfocused‚Äîeyes flicking across the void on the screen like she expected something to blink back.

Luna: ""Hey, will you come here for a second?""

Me: ""Of course, what‚Äôs up?""

Luna: ""Look at the screen. Does it look like a very dim star right in the area Atlas has been looking?""

I rubbed my finger on the screen to make sure it wasn‚Äôt dust.
Me: ""Yeah‚Ä¶ it does.""

Luna: ""But does it seem like it‚Äôs blinking to you?""

Me: ""Oddly, yes. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the atmosphere of Earth, but the actual telescope is floating above Earth's atmosphere. We‚Äôre peering into it‚Äîand it‚Äôs peering into the void currently.""

Luna: ""It seems as if it is a code of some sort. It keeps flashing the same way in odd intervals.""

Leo: ""You guys know how much I love a puzzle. Let me come sit and watch it, and I‚Äôll see if I can't figure it out.""

Luna: ""Be my guest, Einstein. Hahaha.""

Leo walks over, sits down, and starts writing out the flickers as he sees them.

Leo: ""This is gonna take a few hours. Y‚Äôall can go do whatever you need to for the moment.""

Every morning before the sun rises, we all usually grab ourselves some coffee and hike through the jungle side of the island to sit on the pink sand beach and watch the sunrise together. As we walked:

Atlas: ""Doesn't everything seem more quiet to you?""

Luna: ""Now that you mention it‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt seen one of our daily creatures.""

Me: ""Yeah, I haven't even heard a leaf rustle. It‚Äôs way too quiet.""

Atlas: ""Must have just heard Luna's loud mouth this morning.""

Luna: ""Ha ha ha, very funny, dick. I think you're just mad I found something in your void and you didn‚Äôt.""
She sticks her tongue out at Atlas playfully.

We walked through a wall of dense forestry and out onto the beach into the most beautiful sunrise. We sat down to soak it in. That‚Äôs when my phone rang. I looked down‚Äîit was Leo.

Leo (on the phone): ""Hey guys. When you get the chance, I need you to come by the telescope. It‚Äôs rather important.""

I relayed the message and we rushed back. But we took note that everything felt almost normal now‚Äîthe wildlife was back, but still skittish, like we were radioactive. Maybe it was just too early before.

When we returned, Leo looked pale‚Äîlike he‚Äôd seen his grandmother‚Äôs ghost. He looked shaken up.

Atlas: ""What did you find, Leo?""

Leo: ""I just need you to look at the paper I used to decipher the message. And‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt say anything out loud.""

We all leaned in and read the Morse code:

> -.. --- / -. --- - / .-. . ... .--. --- -. -.. .-.-.- / - .... . -.-- / .-- .. .-.. .-.. / .... . .- .-. / -.-- --- ..- .-.-.- / -.-- --- ..- .----. .-. . / -. --- - / .- .-.. --- -. . / --- -. / -.-- --- ..- .-. / .--. .-.. .- -. . - --..-- / --- .-. / - .... . / .. ... .-.. .- -. -.. .-.-.-

We all stared at the message, silence thick like wet cement.

Atlas: ""I have no idea what this means.""

Luna: ""It means you should have paid attention in college.""

Me: ""Luna, quit messing with Atlas. This is serious.""

Leo hadn‚Äôt said a word since handing us the note. He was still staring‚Äîupward.

Me: ""Leo?""

He finally spoke, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúI heard it too.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He looked at me with wide eyes, like a child describing a nightmare.
‚ÄúThe whisper,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight after you guys left.‚Äù

Atlas: ‚ÄúLike what Luna heard earlier?‚Äù

Leo gave a slow, terrified nod. ‚ÄúIt said my name.‚Äù And handed us the paper with the translation on it

Or Am I Just Dreaming Too Hard?,"Okay ENTP fam, I have a weird but kinda beautiful thought I want to throw out there. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è

Sometimes I imagine a future where there's no government, no borders, no money, no gender roles, no war, no countries- just pure freedom and equality. Everyone has what they need. No one works just to survive. Basic needs? Already taken care of food, shelter, health- completely handled by AI.

It's like true communism. I mean a new level AI-run, peaceful, fair. No power games. No one dominating others. Just people living because they want to live, not because they have to survive.

In that world, people work on their passions, not paychecks. One person might explore black holes, someone else might paint full-time, another just wants to grow plants or raise animals or build new tech. Everyone contributes what they love doing, not what they‚Äôre forced to do.

I seriously believe AI could make this real someday. Like, it could manage resources better than any human system. No bias, no greed, just logic and fairness. And with tech evolving so fast, maybe we‚Äôre not that far.

Is this just me dreaming too hard? Or do other ENTPs feel this too?

Like‚Ä¶

What if AI is the key to that kind of world?

What if we‚Äôre meant to explore the universe, not just pay bills until we die (optional)?

Are we visionaries- or just rebellious optimists with wild imaginationü§î? 


Just wondering if I‚Äôm alone in this thought loop. Would love to hear how far you‚Äôve taken this kind of thinking- or if I need to drink less coffee and sleep more üòµ‚Äçüí´.",1,1747278046.0,entp,0,1.0,False

Lately though, I don't end up eating the treat, letting it sit for days, even beyond a week. It's terrible because it's such a waste and I kinda hate seeing it slowly die in the fridge or on the counter (if you're a Friends fan, think Phoebe not riding her bike and it's ""killing the bike's spirit""). 

It's only with ""fancier"" treats too, like a single artisanal cake slice, scone, etc. Cheaper treats like the 99 cent donut would be eaten over the custard tart. It's as if the fancy treat becomes too intimidating to eat. 

I know the simple solution would be to eat the treat immediately or just stop buying them, but wanted to know if anyone else does this, maybe with treats or other foods? I have a sweet tooth too, so it's just really weird that I do this üòï",2,1747277840.0,DoesAnybodyElse,0,1.0,False
1kmxvaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineGrowthPlaybook/comments/1kmxvaz/95_of_buying_decisions_are_emotional_is_your/,95% of Buying Decisions Are Emotional. Is Your Brand Tapping Into That?,"Branding is far more than a logo or slogan‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating an emotional connection with consumers. Here's how psychology drives purchasing decisions and builds loyal customers.

# 1. Emotions Drive 95% of Purchasing Decisions

* **Why it matters:** Research shows that the majority of purchasing decisions are made subconsciously, driven more by emotions than logic.
* **Example:** Apple taps into emotions like trust and excitement, connecting customers to innovation and status.

# 2. Emotional Branding Creates Loyalty

* **Why it matters:** Successful brands use emotions to trigger deep connections, fostering brand loyalty.
* **Example:** Innocent Drinks uses humor and trust to create a positive, refreshing brand experience.

# 3. Brands Create Experiences, Not Just Products

* **Why it matters:** Brands like Nike, Apple, and Dove go beyond selling products; they sell an emotional experience.
* **Example:** Dove's ""Real Beauty"" campaign shifted beauty standards, connecting with consumers on a deeper level of authenticity.

# 4. The Power of Identity in Branding

* **Why it matters:** Brands that align with a consumer's identity, values, or aspirations create stronger emotional bonds.
* **Example:** Gymshark aligns with fitness enthusiasts' desire for strength and self-improvement, making their brand a lifestyle choice.

# 5. Consumers Don‚Äôt Buy Products, They Buy Feelings

* **Why it matters:** Consumers often purchase based on emotional needs like belonging, trust, and aspiration.
* **Example:** Patagonia's environmental activism resonates with eco-conscious buyers, aligning with their values.

# 6. Emotional Triggers Lead to Purchases

* **Why it matters:** Brands that successfully trigger emotions like joy, trust, and urgency can increase conversions and create lasting connections.
* **Example:** Coca-Cola‚Äôs ads tap into joy and family connection, making their brand synonymous with happiness.

# 7. Trust Builds Long-Term Loyalty

* **Why it matters:** Trust is a core emotional trigger in branding, which helps reduce consumer anxiety and builds brand loyalty.
* **Example:** Apple builds trust with its sleek design and focus on privacy, making their devices feel safe and reliable.

# 8. The Mere Exposure Effect: Familiarity Breeds Trust

* **Why it matters:** People tend to trust and choose brands they‚Äôve been exposed to repeatedly.
* **Example:** McDonald's golden arches are globally recognized, and repeated exposure helps consumers feel familiar and secure with the brand.

# 9. Brand Consistency Reinforces Trust

* **Why it matters:** Consistency in branding‚Äîwhether in messaging, design, or customer experience‚Äîhelps reinforce reliability and builds emotional security.
* **Example:** Starbucks maintains the same coffee quality and store experience worldwide, which fosters long-term loyalty.

# 10. Branding Mistakes Can Have Major Consequences

* **Why it matters:** Failing to align with your core audience or sending mixed messages can lead to losing trust and sales.
* **Example:** Bud Light‚Äôs failed attempt to reposition its brand led to significant backlash, loss of customers, and a drop in sales.

# Final Thoughts: Branding Is a Journey, Not a Sprint

Creating a powerful brand is a long-term commitment. By tapping into emotions, aligning with your audience‚Äôs values, and being consistent, you can build a brand that‚Äôs recognized, trusted, and loved.

1kmxuii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmxuii,We worked so hard to get here,"I've been making music with my songwriting partner for about 2 years now. We tried for years to get our own space. Money, drama and flaky people kept us from getting anywhere. People coming and going and wasting our time while we tried to get a band together. 

About 3 months ago I put ads up in local coffee shops for a singer and bass player and within 24 hours I had the band together. They loved our demos and after a few sessions they wanted to join. 

Last month we signed the lease for this spot, a little expensive but everyone is stoked and motivated. I'm happy, it's all paying off ",1,1747277748.0,MusicBattlestations,0,1.0,False

1kmxt2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kmxt2g/aio_toxic_ex_is_a_regular_at_my_new_job/,AIO: Toxic ex is a regular at my new job.,"So I started a new job last week, as a barista at a coffee shop a town over from me. On my second day I noticed my ex of 3 years was there waiting on a drink. This surprised me, as last I knew she was still working in our hometown. I asked around to my new coworkers, and sure enough, she's a regular. Literally works a few buildings over. 

This woman destroyed my life. She is manipulative, hateful, and extremely passive aggressive. I faced much emotional distress and trauma during our time together (which I only found out was abuse after starting therapy....) it has been about 3.5 years since we broke up, and we haven't seen each other since. It was a very rough breakup on my end, and I'm still going to therapy every other week to improve and heal from the damage. 


Today, she placed a mobile order, I saw her name come up and told my co-workers I'd prefer if they could handle her orders. At the end of my shift I decided to leave her a note on her car setting some boundaries about contact. I ran the note passed my manager, and they agreed it was civil and fair. 


For context it said:
Ex's name,
As you may have noticed I have started working at coffee shop.
To maintain boundaries, please only mobile order from now on.
This will allow us to avoid contact.
With love,
Your favorite ex <3

(Yes the sign off is a bit passive aggressive, I'm aware. I thought it was cheeky but not mean...)


The problem is, she got a new car, I didn't know which was hers. I don't know why I didn't just give up, but I thought ""I'll just leave it at the desk of her job, they can deliver it to her, and all will be well."" So I walk in and boom she's sitting at the front desk. I just plop the note in front of her, walk out, and drive home. 

By the time I get home my manager texts me and said ex had called the store and asked to speak to a manager about why she was banned from the store. No where did I say she was banned. I just asked her to please only place mobile orders so I can anticipate her arrival and plan accordingly with staff. 

Now it has caused a lot of drama, my manager is upset, and I'm worried that my ex is out to ruin my new position out of spite. 

Am I in the wrong for trying to set this boundary? Did I fuck up by giving her the note? Or is this her manipulating the situation to her advantage once again to frame me as a bad person to my new job? 

Also I'm autistic and it's hard for me to understand when I'm crossing a line. Maybe this is all my fault.

1kmxplj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1kmxplj/megathread_were_launching_a_fund_that_backs/,"Megathread] We‚Äôre launching a fund that backs independent coffee shop owners ‚Äî today‚Äôs the last day to apply. AMA, feedback, ideas welcome.","TL;DR A transparent share on how we support and fund early-stage coffee shop owners.

At Coffee Futures Fund, we are building a village that brings the entire ecosystem of capital, mentorship and community to support early stage coffee shop owners. 
 
Most startup accelerators are built for tech bros. Most small business loans come too late or with too many strings. And the indie coffee world? It‚Äôs full of passion, but rarely funded or supported that is why 6 out of 10 shops don‚Äôt survive after five years. 

We thought -- what if we built an ecosystem custom-designed for coffee shop owners? One where mentorship, storytelling, and funding *actually reflect the values of the caf√© world.*

So we started CFF. We‚Äôve bootstrapped it so far with a small team and a big belief:  
That the future of coffee is local, community-led, and creatively financed.

We're not a big VC or some corporate-backed incubator. We're coffee owners who have been there; done that ‚Äî and we‚Äôre trying to build something that we wish we had when we started. We bring combined experience of 100+ years in the coffee space. 

üßµ Here‚Äôs what this post is:
- A behind-the-scenes look at the 10-week program
- A transparent share on how we support and fund coffee founders
- A final open invite to apply (today‚Äôs the last day)
- Mostly: an open thread to talk shop with this community

---

###  What is Coffee Futures Fund?

CFF is a 10-week program for emerging coffee entrepreneurs ‚Äî especially early stage US coffee owners (1-3 years old) ‚Äî who want to build something of their own.

We:
- Help you clarify your concept, customer strategy, pricing & ops
- Connect you with mentors (operators, roasters, founders)
- Provide up to 50K funding to selected applicants
- Do it all in a cohort model so you‚Äôre not alone

The goal? Help more independent coffee shops succeed long-term.

Applications close tomorrow (midnight PT):  [coffeefutures.fund](https://www.coffeefutures.fund)

---

### üí¨ Why post here?

Because this is *where the coffee brains are.* Reddit‚Äôs full of baristas, owners, roasters, dreamers, skeptics, and operators who love the craft *and* understand the grind of the business.

If you:
- Run a shop already and want to scale
- Want to understand how we‚Äôre funding this
- Just want to tell us what you think we should be doing

Then hit reply. We‚Äôre listening.

Ask us *anything*. Or roast us. That‚Äôs fair game too.

1kmxoys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AchillesRupture/comments/1kmxoys/just_started_walking_a_week_ago/,Just started walking a week ago,"Non op. Was full weight bear in the boot (15 weeks it was removed). I am able to do 5 min increments and increase as tolerated  (since last Wed) per the doctor. 

I‚Äôve been basically not wearing the boot in my house. If I rest beforehand for 15 mins, then I will walk to/from the bus stop for the kids (7 min round trip). 
Today it‚Äôs pretty swollen and sore. Am I overdoing it? I don‚Äôt walk constantly but I do have kids so I‚Äôm up and down when they‚Äôre home. 
In the day I work from home so not a ton of walking aside to bathroom or kitchen for coffee etc.  (minimal stairs in my day). 
I am wearing runners inside, as that is the most comfortable but by the evening when I finally get to relax I‚Äôm putting my slippers on (solid and comfy sole). 

My physio was impressed with my movement and strength the day after the boot came off (my first appt). And said I could certainly do longer than five mins. 

I remember someone saying pain/swelling pretty normal for a while?? It is pretty sore today. I do NOT want to overdo it. I‚Äôve come too far! 

I have physio again Friday and will ask then, just wanted to hear other experiences once you were given some freedom?

Standup shower and driving has been amazing ü§£ü§£

Shoes:
I bought a pair of Skechers running shoes on clearance and they were so comfortable so I bought another pair to wear inside. My doctor said any shoe would do basically and when I tried on the one shoe it was so comfortable. So happy with them! 

And lastly random question: When you were able to walk w two feet did your doctor tell you to lead with your injured foot or the other one when going downstairs? My doctor and physio said opposite things ü§£.  So was just curious !

Sorry this is so long! Happy healing to you all. ",1,1747277260.0,AchillesRupture,0,1.0,False

1kmxmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kmxmom/5_years_of_ibs_heres_what_happened/,5 years of IBS‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs what happened,"I‚Äôm mostly writing this post because ranting about my IBS issues eases my anxiety, which in turn, eases my IBS. Love the gut-brain connection. 

I got IBS 5 years ago after an entire day of hiking (with minimal water) and then scarfing down Korean fried chicken and a few soju bombs. That night while I was on the porcelain throne, I had experienced the worst cramps and stomach pains of my life. It was so bad I almost fainted and was getting light headed. Basically, those poor decisions backed me up so bad and altered my GI track. 

Next day I thought I was fine, but every time I would eat I would get those awful cramps and sit on the toilet for long periods of time. This cycle of eating and immediately being in pain persisted for months. It got to the point where at times I was bed ridden, sobbing my eyes out. This was all while I was finishing up my MA in college, so I had even worse anxiety when I was on location for my internship, then when I would get home I would crash and all the IBS symptoms would appear. 

It got to the point where I was too scared to eat so I would starve myself which ended up putting me in even more pain and making my IBS worse. 

During that time I saw my doctor who recommended me Metamucil and and improved diet, and it helped for a little, but I was still always so backed up and the cramps kept hitting at random. I began doing my own research and came across IBS, and man it sounded exactly like what I had. The next doc appt I finally asked if he could refer me to a gastroenterologist. He did, and I booked that appointment so fast. 

I had to wait 2 more months for that doctors visit, and when I finally got there and she told me I had IBS-M, I broke down crying in the office because finally I had an official diagnosis of what was wrong with me. After that she referred me to a dietitian who helped me through the elimination diet, which took many more months. I took my sweet time with it because my relationship with food had deteriorated so much that I was terrified to try anything. Found out my main triggers were apples, garlic, beef, coffee, spicy foods, and a few others and I started to cut out sugar, gluten and dairy (as much as I could, I still indulge here and there). 

While it really helped, the elimination diet was PAINFUL. I started with garlic (I know, idk why I did that) and I was so confident that I could eat 1/2 a clove‚Ä¶ until the cramps began. No more garlic for me :( I also had to try and get through 1/2 cup of beans in a day. I couldn‚Äôt do it, not that it was a trigger, it was just too many beans. 

Things started looking up after that, I was more confident in what I could do/try though it did take me a year to begin reincorporating non-low fodmap foods into my diet again. Since then I‚Äôve rekindled my relationship with food and stocked up on IBGuard, Imodium, Citrucel tablets, and all the other things I needed for emergencies. 

Right now I‚Äôm laying in bed with an upset stomach because I ate some red bell pepper and it‚Äôs not sitting well with me at all :) but now I know I need to stay away from red bell peppers because they‚Äôre probably a trigger. 

My IBS journey sucked and I would never wish that kind of internal pain on even my worst enemy. That feeling of helplessness I felt for 6 months (because I had no idea what was going on) traumatized me. Even 5 years later I‚Äôm still identifying triggers and slowly mending my relationship with food. I‚Äôm just happy that recovery is going okay. 

Anyways, hope my story helped. Or at least was entertaining. ",5,1747277063.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

**The Everfull Mug of ""Ale""**

XP Value: 400 | GP Value: 1,500

Powers:

‚Ä¢ Endless liquid‚Äîbut the drink changes each time:
Roll 1d6: 1) Ale, 2) Water, 3) Vinegar, 4) Liquid Cheese (See table below), 5) Spiders (harmless), 6) The DM‚Äôs Choice (See table below),.

‚Ä¢ 1/day: The mug compliments the drinker in a fake dwarven accent.

Lore: Commissioned by a gnome tavern-keep to ""save on costs."" Now banned in three cities.

Curse: After 10 uses, the mug falls in love with the drinker and writes bad poetry. (Notes appear in mug at random intervals, hopefully not while you are drinking from it.)

**Random Liquid Cheese Chart (1d10):**
When the Everfull Mug produces Liquid Cheese, roll to determine what unholy dairy (or dairy-like) substance pours forth:

1. Glorious Gouda Gold ‚Äì Rich, buttery, and perfectly melty. Ideal for dipping bread. The mug sighs happily.
2. Bubbling Cheddar Fondue ‚Äì Sharp, tangy, and inexplicably stays warm. No one questions it.
3. Mystery Inn Cheese Soup ‚Äì Probably safe. Probably. Tastes like nostalgia and questionable decisions.
4. Blue Cheese Slurry ‚Äì Bold, pungent, and aggressively lumpy. The mug coughs apologetically.
5. ""Cheese"" from the Wizard‚Äôs Lunchbox ‚Äì Vaguely cheesy, slightly glowing. Grants +1 to Arcana checks (and -1 to Constitution saves).
6. Ratfolk ""Artisanal"" Spread ‚Äì Smells like a cellar. Tastes like regret. The mug mutters, ""Look, it‚Äôs technically cheese.""
7. Spectral Swiss ‚Äì Full of holes. Literally. Drips through solid surfaces if not consumed quickly.
8. Gelatinous Cube Cheese ‚Äì Translucent, jiggly, and mildly carnivorous. The mug warns, ""Don‚Äôt let it touch your fingers.""
9. Stink Hag‚Äôs Toe Curd ‚Äì The smell alone requires a CON save (DC 12) to avoid vomiting. The mug giggles.
10. The Cheese That Should Not Be ‚Äì It whispers. It watches. The mug screams and flips itself over to stop the flow.

Optional Rule: If a player drinks #10, they gain a temporary madness (per DMG) and an irrational fear of dairy.

*DM‚Äôs Choice Liquid Table (1d20 or choose)*

Roll to determine what eldritch, nonsensical, or mildly cursed beverage pours forth this time.

1. Sentient Gravy ‚Äì It whispers compliments (""Mmm, yes, pour me on those potatoes"") and gets offended if wasted.
2. Liquid Lute ‚Äì Drinkable music. Causes the consumer to hum uncontrollably for 1d4 hours.
3. Dwarven Beard Oil ‚Äì Not technically a drink, but the mug insists it‚Äôs ""fortifying."" Grants +1 to Charisma (Persuasion) vs. dwarves.
4. Mimic Spit ‚Äì Sticky, vaguely metallic, and deeply unsettling. The mug shudders.
5. Reverse Wine ‚Äì Starts as vinegar, but the more you drink, the sweeter it gets. Confuses sommeliers.
6. Gnomish ""Coffee"" ‚Äì 90% sugar, 10% lightning. Consumer‚Äôs hair stands on end for an hour.
7. The DM‚Äôs Tears ‚Äì Salty. Occasionally prophetic. The mug murmurs, ""Rocks fall, everyone cries.""
8. Polymorph Punch ‚Äì Turns the drinker‚Äôs teeth a random color for 24 hours. No other effect.
9. Invisible Soup ‚Äì It‚Äôs definitely there. You can feel it. The mug insists it‚Äôs ""delicious.""
10. Molten Candy ‚Äì Scalding hot, but tastes like birthday cake. CON save (DC 12) or take 1 fire damage.
11. Echo Water ‚Äì Repeats the last thing said near it when swallowed. ""Wait, did I just drink my own voice?""
12. Bubblegum Mead ‚Äì Non-Newtonian. Chewy when sipped, liquid when chewed. The mug finds this hilarious.
13. Antimatter Ale ‚Äì Pours normally but vanishes the moment it touches a surface. The mug claims it was ""perfectly good.""
14. Spectral Milk ‚Äì Glows faintly. Cats stare at it intently, even if no cats are present.
15. The Forbidden Smoothie ‚Äì Ingredients unknown. Smells like a wizard‚Äôs laundry. CON save (DC 15) or hallucinate tiny dancing goblins.
16. Backwash of the Gods ‚Äì A divine aftertaste lingers. The mug shrugs, ""Hey, ambrosia‚Äôs gotta go somewhere.""
17. Liquid Deja Vu ‚Äì The drinker feels like they‚Äôve had this before. Because they have.
18. The DM‚Äôs Backup Plot ‚Äì A swirling, ink-like substance. Drinking it grants +1 to Insight (you briefly understand the campaign).
19. Mimic‚Äôs Revenge ‚Äì Looks like ale. Tastes like ale. Is actually ale. The mug is very disappointed in you for suspecting otherwise.
20. The Void ‚Äì The mug pours nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not even air. The drinker‚Äôs mouth feels wrong for an hour.

Optional Rules:

‚Ä¢ Critical Success/Fail: On a nat 1, the liquid is actively hostile (e.g., ""Liquid Rust"" that tarnishes armor). On a nat 20, it‚Äôs miraculously useful (e.g., ""Potion of Temporary Sobriety"").

‚Ä¢ Mug‚Äôs Commentary: The mug will judge your reaction. (""Oh, come on, it‚Äôs not THAT bad. Probably."")

Just want to state I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with anything before. I just am curious if there‚Äôs others with anything similar.

So when I eat something too fast, I will get really bad cramps (like I just got the stomach bug) and will have to run to the bathroom and I get explosive diahrea, I sweat, get cold and my cramps are so bad it feels like I‚Äôm about to give birth. Basically feels like the stomach flu. 

I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs always just when I eat too fast. Like today at work I didn‚Äôt eat any breakfast, so I was starving near lunch and ate a protein bar very fast before the gym. Then an hour later terrible cramps and I had to run to bathroom twice and it was just pure liquid and bad cramps. 

The week before I ate two boiled eggs fast (I wasn‚Äôt even that hungry) I just wanted to make sure I got protein and I had the worst stomach cramps and diahrea.

A recent ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù regarding the many Bunnahabhain 12 reviews and comments made over the years suggesting that B12 & B18 were mildly peated prompted me to revisit a bottle of the 12 year old bottled in 2022 to see if I could better understand it‚Äôs profile. I paid much more attention when enjoying a dram this time.

A very cogent case was made for tannins found in a particular type of oak barrels sometimes used by Bunnahabhain being the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù for the earthy, woodsy or dirty note that many mistake for peat when describing the nonpeated B12 & B18.  

So, here are my notes. Please beadvised that my nose doesn‚Äôt pick up as many notes as my palate. It‚Äôs hard enough breathing through it let alone using it to explore scotch.

Nose: Sherry and a hint of strawberry twizzlers candy. (at least I didn‚Äôt consume all that red dye)

Palate: Thick, oily mouth feel. Shows earthy dry straw mixed with earthy coffee grounds dusted with powdered chocolate followed by sherry and some sour cherry that was somewhat astringent. A hint of burnt paper floated by. There is a little vanilla floating in and out as well. The profile evolved into a slightly astringent mix of sour, dirty sherry and over-baked cookie dough. There is a slight alcohol nip I find common in younger whisky. The hint of burnt paper was the biggest surprise.

Finish: looong. I can still taste the sherry mixture an hour later.

The Bunnahabhain 12 is very good and well made. It is one of the few 12 year olds I drink ( I prefer older whisky) because the profile is interesting and quite different from most 12 year olds.  A side note, I just broke down and bought a Glendronach 12  to try (I enjoy the 15 & 18) and, as I feared, it‚Äòs not very compelling.

So, in summary, a very well made non peated whisky exhibiting a very interesting flavor profile that wants to trick you into thinking it is slightly peated. You get your money‚Äôs worth out of this one.

Enjoy

1kmxi24,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshmenttrauma/comments/1kmxi24/dating_someone_with_enmeshed_family_namely/,"Dating someone with enmeshed family, namely mom...need advice","Hi. So I really need help and inside perspectives on this. I have been dating someone almost a year who is enmeshed with his mom- but the whole family is enmeshed. I believe this is the root issue for him, that likely causes all our relationship issues. 

He has had a history of ""sabotaging"" relationships. It's very fair to classify him as avoidant attachment. He can be very sweet, but also very difficult. I am at the stage where I'm not quite sure who he is (and thats prob bc he isnt either). 

When we first started dating I remember him being very stressed after a call with his mom and discussing worries about her finances and how she won't make necessary changes. I offered to pray with him. I remember that distinctly bc it's now almost exactly a year later, and he's brought the same up. 

During the beginning of our relationship it was very healthy, or so I thought, and we were very close- or so I thought. Headed towards marriage, or SO I THOUGHT.. anyways, when we visited his mom first, I immediately saw something was very off. My sweet, strong man became passive, and I felt oddly left out. I go this weird feeling that his mom didn't like me? I am 39 years old, and I've never experienced this with many parents of someone I've dated. I was very confused. I also saw him become almost in a trance, doing whatever she said and chasing after her. It was very weird. I asked if we could go out and get a coffee one morning, and he said we couldnt bc we needed to go pick up his mom. We got to her home and she wasnt even there.. we waited on her. 

Anyways, I brought that up to him. He agreed, he said he never felt comfortable growing up in that home, couldnt sleep always had anxiety. I told him I felt super uncomfortable with how she had spoken to him (she called him a little s\*\*\*) and she was very weird with me the day he left the home and we were alone. Later I showed him an enmeshment video, that was very respectful but honest. He agreed. He said he spoke with his mom and told her we wouldnt stay there next time and it made us uncomfortable. I thought we were making headway. 

Fast forward a few months, idk what this woman said to him- or someone else who knows- but all the sudden, he doesnt want to get married, doesnt think we are a right fit, broke up with me multiple xs, it was like we went from not fighting to i couldnt speak to him without him getting defensive. I was blindsighted. 

We are still technically together, but honestly, he's treating me as he does his mom. He's very polite, but very distant. And I feel he's placating me. But the difference? I'm not his mom. I actually want to know and love this man and route him on. he's hurt me A LOT. I'm very tired and close to giving up. HOWEVER, I guess I feel.. if it's already over, why not be honest in the end? Any advice on a) protecting myself. b) helping him c) being realistic about it all d) insight into his view. I noticed the mom is super attached to him, but it goes both ways. She will ""punish him"" if he upsets her and ignore him a few days, and he will try to call her. I've noticed she does this to get him back in line. They talk on the phone every day. She's a widow, the husband was bipolar. But shes always been this way. Her sister died in January, and that is when he reconnected with her and started separating from me. 

I guess bc of my age, and wanting to have kids- I dont have much time to waste. And he may have wasted a year of mine. He's 32, so it's different for him. I honestly can't tell what is true that comes out his mouth. He seems very confused. Do I have a dog in this fight? HELP :(",1,1747276664.0,enmeshmenttrauma,2,1.0,False

Anyway, spoke to her earlier and she wants to come home this coming Monday and she wants to speak to the social worker at the facility about it. I think Monday sounds too soon and no one has given a report to me yet about how her physical therapy is going. I know she‚Äôs doing better though because she looks and sounds better. It‚Äôs my understanding at the minimum that about 3 weeks of pt is necessary to build up her strength and see where‚Äôs she‚Äôs at. So I arrive at the facility, give my mom her coffee and dessert and tell her I‚Äôm going to introduce myself to the social worker. She says okay. I really like the social worker. I asked her if she could tell me where we were at with my mother‚Äôs therapy and I had a couple of questions about my mother‚Äôs insurance also.

1kmx86v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SumaMethod/comments/1kmx86v/daily_practices_for_wellbeing_in_recovery/,Daily Practices for Wellbeing in Recovery,"*Because staying well is more than staying clean.*

Recovery is not a single decision‚Äîit‚Äôs a series of daily choices.  
And those choices aren‚Äôt just about avoiding the addictive thing. They‚Äôre about building the kind of inner and outer environment that makes returning to yourself possible, sustainable, and safe.

In the Suma Method, recovery isn‚Äôt measured by abstinence alone. It‚Äôs measured by system coherence. That means every small, consistent action that supports your physical, emotional, relational, intellectual, spiritual, or purpose-based wellbeing is part of your recovery. These practices are not add-ons. They‚Äôre infrastructure.

Here are a few core practices that help stabilize the self-system and anchor recovery in daily life:

**1. Grounding the Body (Physical Domain)**  
Drink water before coffee. Stretch before screens. Eat something nourishing before the day devours you.  
Your nervous system is a key player in recovery‚Äîtreat it like a partner, not an afterthought. Reconnect with your body through sleep, hydration, movement, rest, and pleasure. Not to earn anything, but to *support your own staying.*

**2. Name and Feel Your Emotions (Emotional Domain)**  
Recovery demands emotional literacy. Set aside even five minutes a day to ask: *What am I feeling? What triggered this? What do I need right now?*  
You don‚Äôt need to fix your feelings. You just need to stop abandoning them. Journaling, voice memos, or even naming emotions aloud can disrupt old loops and give your feelings somewhere to land.

**3. Tend to Your Thinking (Intellectual Domain)**  
Not all thoughts are true. Not all beliefs are yours.  
A daily mental hygiene practice‚Äîlike cognitive reframing, writing down distorted thoughts, or practicing mindfulness‚Äîhelps reduce the noise. The goal isn‚Äôt to silence the mind. It‚Äôs to become a trustworthy narrator of your own life.

**4. Connect Intentionally (Relational Domain)**  
You don‚Äôt need a hundred people. You need a few safe ones.  
Send a check-in text. Join a support space. Let someone know what‚Äôs *really* going on. Recovery thrives in relationship, not isolation. If you‚Äôre not ready to be vulnerable, start with honesty with yourself‚Äîand let connection build from there.

**5. Recenter with Meaning (Spiritual Domain)**  
Recovery is hard. Make sure you remember *why* you‚Äôre doing it.  
Whether it‚Äôs through meditation, prayer, nature, ritual, or silence, return to something larger than your cravings and stronger than your shame. Spiritual practices don‚Äôt require religion. They require *remembrance*.

**6. Reaffirm Your Direction (Purpose Domain)**  
Each day, ask: *What small thing can I do that aligns with the person I‚Äôm becoming?*  
It doesn‚Äôt have to be world-changing. Write a sentence. Help someone. Do the next kind thing. Recovery isn‚Äôt just about who you were. It‚Äôs about who you‚Äôre building‚Äîand what kind of life will be able to hold them.

Daily practices are not glamorous. They are not always exciting. But they are *how the future gets built*.  
One moment of coherence at a time.  
One day of staying with yourself at a time.  
One act of remembrance that says:  
*I‚Äôm still here. And I‚Äôm still choosing myself.*",1,1747275809.0,SumaMethod,0,1.0,False

Now where I live there's this path that's roughly the width of say about minivan or about the width of SUV, and there's roughly across from this, not sure if it's even a full road, but kind of dirt path. Right across from me my house on the other other side of that pathway  into I guess kind of quazy culdasac are two houses, one directly across from me, right next it is another house, that owned by the most streotypical suburban older woman type ever complete with that kind of very over tanned, sort of 80s plastic tanned look. Omg it is just, wowza. Anyway I  go for walks semi regularly and just came back from suuuper nice one.  Just as I'm heading up some stairs. That person came up to me puffy and yelling ""Sir, Sir, your AC is really annoying me! "" so of course I didn't way any attention and tried to keep going, thinking: what is this person talking about man. ""SIIIIR SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!!"" this older lady, hardly any meat on her bones, way over tanned, was right in my personal space just as was about to close the door, and in fact I tried to when she had a foot in the door way. So I naturally  thought: What do I do, ok? do call the police? do grunt? is it some dire thing?  etc etc. NO! this crazy lady just wanted to tell me how, I've got my AC on and it's somehow bothering her. 

My first instincive thought was: ""ok that's nice, so not wear earplugs or something.""

OOH no she was already going on about how I ""have to"" move the same AC I've owned for ages now and that she had worked it up in her mind that it somehow my up to me to fix this problem and gosh she's got a quite AC. Man it took everything to not just laugh because of just how rediculous, and surreal this whole thing was. And I just wanted some coffee and to get off my feet and take my shoes off, walk for both health (to loose weight.) and for fresh air and touch grass right.

Ok well a week or so past so I thought: well ok maybe the crazy lady moved on or something. NOPE I was coming back and: simillar thing

What this lady didn't know was I had been meaning to try to move the AC to a slightly more better window anyway I just had find a guy that might be able to help  make the right kind of ledge since I just have the tools or knowledge to make nice little ledge to help support the AC in the new window it's currently in. And I did that last friday.

Unknwn to me: this crazy lady had:  been stalking me, us google maps and! as it turns out she's a realestate agent and this is where things go off the rails. She had taken to stalking my family, and harassing them and making vague faux legal threats, citing, citing all kinds of stuff about sound ordininces and how an that exact same window with a few different AC units for at least 20 years or so is now a huge problem, Even though no one that's owned any houses around me has ever complained!

Now from what I understand from family is they and her have some kind of deal.  But they did also make it clear that should she push things it won't end well for her. 

Like what the hell man for a weird compirson: up from about I think 2011ish all the way up to 2020 I had made MORE noise cosplaying as a Klingon as a smal funky little charity event to raise money for cancer research, where the last day of the event on christmas me and a hand full of other people would be up pretty late loudly singing in some key that never matched the right ones in Tarren. And people sure seemed to have a great 'ol time, and when I do Halloween with making a decent racket no one complained about that, I think the construction crews around now and the better parts of summer make more noise than I do.

The AC is a frigidair and it's not that old.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend ‚Äî let‚Äôs call him Charles ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm questioning how I handled things and whether I‚Äôm being too sensitive or if I need to set firmer boundaries.

Charles and I met through my school‚Äôs library, and we clicked pretty quickly. I ended up opening up to him about some deeply personal stuff ‚Äî childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. I thought he was someone I could trust.

Over time, things started to shift. He brought me to his church group, which I initially liked, but then he and his brother began pushing political conversations ‚Äî especially pro-Trump stuff ‚Äî even after I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable talking about politics. At one point, he kept pressing me about whether my beliefs were ‚Äújust inherited from my dad,‚Äù and when I didn‚Äôt want to answer, he wouldn‚Äôt drop it.

I eventually told him his behavior wasn't appreciated and that an apology would suffice. He refused to apologize over text and insisted we meet in person (also told me the friendship is over prior to meeting). When we did, I even bought him a coffee, trying to smooth things over, but instead of apologizing, he basically told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down, and that I was ""talking like the devil."" He also tried to pray with me, which I declined. The whole thing left me feeling belittled and disrespected, so I walked away and decided to end the friendship.

Since then, I‚Äôve stepped back from the church group and distanced myself from anyone in his circle. But lately, I‚Äôve started feeling anxious ‚Äî his brother randomly removed me on LinkedIn, and Charles has acted like nothing happened when he sees me, giving me fist bumps and being weirdly friendly. Some of his friends have reached out, but I haven‚Äôt responded much ‚Äî just said I‚Äôm busy.

Now I‚Äôm worried he might be sharing personal things I told him during our friendship ‚Äî especially the mental health stuff ‚Äî and using it to make me look bad. Or, he may be spinning the narrative trying to make me look cold and distant for walking away from everyone and the church even after showing concern for my absence. I feel like I‚Äôve lost control of the narrative and it‚Äôs eating at me.

The other day, I saw him sitting two seats in front of me at the library (his back was facing me). When. got up to go for a drink, he quickly grabbed his stuff and moved 4 rows down and sat facing towards me. what's that all about ?

**AITA for cutting him off the way I did, and would I be the AH if I reached out to mutual friends to clear the air or explain my side? Or should I just let it go and focus on moving forward?**



  
**TL;DR:**  
OP (late 20s M) cut off a friend, Charles, after being belittled and disrespected‚Äîespecially during a conversation where Charles refused to apologize and instead criticized OP's self-esteem, called him ""the devil,"" and tried to force a prayer. Charles also may be sharing OP‚Äôs personal mental health struggles with others. Now OP feels anxious, isolated from the group they were both part of, and uncertain whether to speak up to mutual friends to clarify things or just let it go. OP asks: AITA for cutting Charles off, and would it be wrong to reach out to mutuals to explain his side?",2,1747275318.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

To set the stage, these are things that bothered me before we even had kids: 1) insisting she has to pay for everything because we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have money‚Äù (we all do well for ourselves so this in itself is so insulting to me). It goes beyond the typical ‚Äúparents pay for dinner‚Äù trope because she gets MAD if we even tried to pay for something small like a coffee. 2) telling her adult children they can‚Äôt travel to countries she doesn‚Äôt like or do certain things she doesn‚Äôt like or she will disconnect them from their bank account (they have their own job and money so idek how she thinks this would be possible). 3) sent a turkey to us when my husband told her I was cooking thanksgiving for the first time because she wanted to make sure her son ‚Äúhad a good thanksgiving.‚Äù 4) she calls my husband literally screaming at him for something he did that pissed his sister off. It can be something so minor. There‚Äôs never a ‚Äúhey so and so is upset about this maybe you should give them a call‚Äù. It‚Äôs always yelling, cussing, crying, so much drama. Never direct conflict that actually goes anywhere. They do not talk about issues, it blows up and then everyone pretends it didn‚Äôt happen.
Now that we have a son of our own I am so over it. I will be standing right behind him (our son), and she will literally get between me and my son to tell him not to do something or touch something. I have told her several times, and my husband has told her several times, when  we are near our son (which tbh is all the time), she doesn‚Äôt have to tell him not to do something. Example: we are at a store and he is looking at a toy, I‚Äôm right behind him watching, she comes between us and tells him he can‚Äôt look at the toy and to put it back. She continues to overstep us and parent over us when we have both asked her to stop. I don‚Äôt want to take total visitation away from her, but I told my husband until she respects us, she can‚Äôt have my son for the weekend etc and I want to limit time around her to a bare minimum. My husband is following my lead. 
 I admittedly have a lot of pent up animosity towards her. I don‚Äôt want that to cloud my judgement especially when it comes to my son having a relationship with his grandma. Am I overreacting?",5,1747275046.0,AmIOverreacting,23,1.0,False

[https://www.plantedshack.com/what-is-mid-century-modern-style-the-new-timeless-design-trend/](https://www.plantedshack.com/what-is-mid-century-modern-style-the-new-timeless-design-trend/)

  
Mid-century modern style has resurfaced as one of the most sought-after design trends in contemporary interior styling. This distinctive aesthetic, rooted in the design innovations of the 1940s to 1960s, continues to inspire homeowners and designers alike. With its clean lines, organic forms, and integration of nature, mid-century modern offers a fresh approach to timeless design. In this article, we‚Äôll explore what defines mid-century modern style, its characteristics, and how to achieve this look in your own space.

  
The Origins of Mid-Century Modern Style

  
Mid-century modern style emerged during a period of innovation that coincided with post-war optimism. Influenced by a combination of technological advancements and a desire for simplicity, this movement reshaped the way designers approached furniture and architecture.

  
Historical Context

  
: After World War II, there was a push for functional, affordable designs that could cater to the growing middle class.

  
Key Figures

  
: Influential designers such as Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, and Hans Wegner played crucial roles in developing mid-century modern aesthetics.

  
Characteristics of Mid-Century Modern Design

  
What sets mid-century modern apart? Understanding its core characteristics can help you identify and incorporate this style effectively.

  
Clean Lines and Geometric Shapes

  
One of the most prominent features of mid-century modern design is its focus on clean, straight lines.

  
Minimal Ornamentation

  
: Unlike ornate styles, mid-century modern prioritizes simplicity.

  
Geometric Forms

  
: Expect to see triangles, rectangles, and other geometric shapes integrated into furniture and decor.

  
Functionality and Form

  
Form follows function is a principle at the heart of mid-century modern design.

  
Practicality

  
: Every piece of furniture is designed with purpose and usefulness in mind.

  
Multi-Seating Options

  
: Sofas and chairs often feature modular designs that can adapt to different spaces.

  
Natural Materials and Colors

  
Mid-century modern interiors embrace organic materials and a color palette that reflects nature.

  
Wood

  
: Warm woods like teak, walnut, and maple are frequently used.

  
Colors

  
: Earthy tones‚Äîsuch as olive green, mustard yellow, and burnt orange‚Äî are commonly paired with neutral shades.

  
Indoor-Outdoor Connection

  
Mid-century modern design blurs the lines between indoors and outdoors.

  
Large Windows

  
: Expansive glass windows and open floor plans invite natural light and views.

  
Natural Elements

  
: Landscaping often complements the architecture, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

  
How to Achieve the Mid-Century Modern Look

  
Transforming your space to reflect mid-century modern style doesn‚Äôt require a complete overhaul. Here are some practical tips to help you capture this timeless trend:

  
1.

  
Choose Iconic Furniture

  
Invest in classic mid-century pieces or modern replicas.

  
Look for:

  
Eames lounge chairs

  
Saarinen tulip tables

  
Danish teak sideboards

  
2.

  
Embrace Bold Colors

  
Use a mix of earthy and vibrant colors to create an inviting atmosphere.

  
Consider accent walls or throw pillows in shades of:

  
Moss green

  
Tangerine

  
Mustard

  
3.

  
Incorporate Wood Elements

  
Opt for furniture made from rich, warm woods.

  
Examples include:

  
A walnut dining table

  
Teak bookshelves

  
Oak coffee tables

  
4.

  
Maximize Natural Light

  
Let the light in by using sheer curtains or going curtain-free in some spaces.

  
Replace heavy drapes with:

  
Light-filtering panels

  
Minimal window treatments

  
5.

  
Add Artwork and Accessories

  
Choose art and d√©cor that reflects the mid-century ethos.

  
Consider:

  
Abstract art pieces

  
Vintage ceramics

  
Geometric patterned rugs

  
Conclusion

  
Mid-century modern style is more than just a design trend; it is a celebration of simplicity, functionality, and a harmonious relationship with nature. By recognizing its core characteristics and incorporating key elements into your home, you can achieve a timeless aesthetic that feels fresh and inviting. Whether you choose to invest in iconic furniture, embrace bold colors, or create a seamless indoor-outdoor flow, mid-century modern design offers endless possibilities for personal expression. So, embark on your journey to create a space that embodies the elegance and charm of this enduring style.

  
By integrating these principles, you‚Äôll find that mid-century modern is not merely a fleeting trend but a lasting influence that can elevate your home‚Äôs aesthetic for years to come.

1kmwscn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kmwscn,Beetle Tray I'm trying,"So.  I'm brand new to using reddit...  I used to raise a few mealworms but just in a coffee can.  Now I have seven lizards living on my outside deck, and we have chickens, so I'm scaling up. After scanning the internet and Reddit, I came up with this initial setup.  

The trays are just seedling start trays.  I cut out most of the bottom, leaving a 1"" strip intact across the middle for support, and about a 3/4 in lip on all 4 sides.  I cut three sticks of wood and screwed to the bottom for spacers to allow air to the tray underneath.  Then I put 1/4 in hardware cloth on the inside bottom and secured it with cable ties.  Over that I laid a piece of window screen, hot-glued it to the hardware cloth, and then sealed the edges with duct tape. The window screen alone was not strong enough to stay in place.  Note:  I used a woodburner I have to cut out the bottom of the tray and make holes for the cable ties.  That worked very well as the flimsy plastic might be hard to cut with power tools, but is too tough for a knife.

I added their food on top of the screen.  Also, an empty upside-down small ice cream container for the pupae, and a bit of egg carton for the beetle motel.  I keep a clear plastic bin over the pupae stand to maintain humidity in there - I can't find the big plastic cover for the whole tray.

For all food and bedding, I use only organic foods.  A mixture of rolled oats and wheat bran.  I supplement this with organic apple slices, potato slices, carrot chunks and some salad greens.  I tried some bananas but they didn't seem to excited about those.  The oats and wheat bran come from Azure Standard mail order.  The wheat bran is very fine, but I couldn't find organic cheap wheat bran flakes.  I just add the wheat bran in piles on top the potato slices in the oats, so it doesn't just immediately fall through the screen on the bottom.  The worms and beetles seem to seek it out when they want some.

I tried some non-organic foods on a few worms.  They just crawled to the top and laid there.  Whereas with the organic only, they are very active crawling around through it all the time.

How it works.  I have another tray with maturing worms I bought.  As pupae form, I put them on the elevated top of the inverted ice cream bin.  As the beetles emerge they fall down to the main tray.  The beetles nibble on other pupae if they can get to them; they can't climb back up the ice cream carton. Now, hopefully, the eggs and hatching larvae will fall through the bottom screen into the tray below.  After a month, I will replace the bottom tray with a fresh one while the new worms grow.  Am thinking after 3 months I will start an additional new beetle tray.

There are about thirty hatched beetles in the tray now, and another hundred pupae on the platform.

I will receive a thermometer and humidity device next week, for now all I can say is they are in a warm room temperature; we keep the daytime air at 77 deg, with the lovely natural humidity of central Virginia.  The worms I bought initially produced rather small beetles.  But the majority now maturing, and having had good organic food, are considerably bigger and much more active. 

I will share notes as this progresses.  I'm hoping this will be an economical system that I can scale up.  And I would be glad to hear advice from others' experience with raising mealworms.",1,1747274450.0,u_Fit-Cauliflower7494,0,1.0,False

I feel like I‚Äôm getting so much information shoved in my brain that I can‚Äôt remember and the people working with me know exactly what to do and end up rushing around at max speed while I stand there in the way. How do you memorize everything on the menu? Is there an easier way to navigate inputting customers orders? Does it get any better with time? I‚Äôm really not experienced making coffee and I feel like I‚Äôm getting no time to actually remember the drinks because there are too many orders coming in and I‚Äôm too slow. Not to mention the 40+ hours of computer training that I have to do. I don‚Äôt want to just quit but man I‚Äôm way too stressed and everyone tells me it will get better with time.

1kmwlgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMoto/comments/1kmwlgk/la_riding_groups_list/,LA Riding Groups List,"Hey hey hey! Back when I was a newbie rider I remember struggling to find groups where you could just show up and ride that weren't mob rides or overly dangerous.

I've found that the LA Moto Scene seems to be heavily on Instagram so anything with an @ is an instagram handle.

___

@beachsidemotoclub

They ride once a month, usually on a Saturday. Their rides are announced well in advance on their instagram. Generally starts at a coffee shop, ends at a brewery. Group size is generally pretty big, I'd say maybe 50 on average? You can browse their page to get an idea of how many people show up. Despite it being such a large group, they plan the routes out in advance and have dedicated organizers so the rides tend to go pretty smooth.

Rides are generally on the slower side since there's so many people, the routes avoid freeways, and usuallly include some twisties but occasionally it's all/mostly just city riding.

___

@losangelesmotorcycleclub

Rides weekly every Sunday. Generally meets at a coffee shop, usually ends up at some kind of restaurant. Ride sizes vary from 6 - 20. Sometimes they'll go on the freeway (especially now since PCH is closed) but the rides always consist of some kind of twisties. Peppier rides than beachsidemotoclub but nothing crazy. Very open to newcomers but you might want to keep to the back of the group if you're inexperienced in the twisties. They generally have a sweeper to make sure nobody gets lost.

___

[Lifestyle Cycles](https://www.meetup.com/lifestyle-cycles-riding-group/) generally ride every Saturday. Around 30-ish people usually? Skews older since they're a Harley dealership. But you can (and people do) show up on any bike you'd like. They usually describe what kind of route they're doing in advance but sometimes it's twisties, sometimes highway, you've just gotta check their meetup/facebook beforehand to see the ride that week.

___

@ca_motorcycle_community is not a riding group on its own but they do share out a lot of other group ride info. Sometimes it's mob rides, sometime's it's cruiser groups, you've gotta kinda read into each one. But overall a good place if you just want to know about a ton of motorcycle events (although some stuff they post is more in NorCal).

___

Anyways I'm sure there's plenty more groups, feel free to add them. These are just ones that moreso met what I was looking for (groups that are open to newcomers, not mob rides, generally law abiding) and I hope this list is useful to anyone who was in my position.",2,1747273865.0,LAMoto,0,1.0,False

1kmwk0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kmwk0d/aitah_for_asking_if_i_can_go_through_my_partners/,AITAH for asking if I can go through my partners phone,"We are in a long distance relationship in college. We dated for an year before she transferred schools but kept the relationship going since time difference was negligible. After a semester in LDR we decided to put it on pause but a month later ended up getting back together when I met her on a trip. So now we've been together a couple of months again. 

A couple weeks ago she told me she had a hinge profile. I was obviously pretty hurt and asked her why she hadn't told me this. She told me her friends made it for her and that she only used it with her friends to see what kinda guys matched with her and joke about it. She promised me it wasnt more, showed me her profile and things and promised she only used it as a joke w friends. I was kinda iffy about it but I though to trust her. 2 weeks ago, she meets this new guy through her best friend. Shes told me multiple instances of her best friend and the guy flirting when she's around and how it annoyed her at times. So I didn't think much about it. 

3 days ago, when we had plans to do some things on call, she said she had to leave earlier and I asked her why and she said bc she had to drop something off at his place. And I said it was kinda rude for her to leave mid call when we had made plans (she's always iffy on plans asw and likes to do things when it comes to making plans to do things). I was obviously kinda pissed. And she already had plans with him and her friend to go together to the mall literally the next day. So to me it was really really weird and after discussing she ended up saying shes going to cancel. 

So fast forward to today. I'm flying to another country for a family thing. I'll be in a +7 hour time diff for the next 3 months so today was our last day together where we'd be able to spend proper time in 3 months. I thought she'd be willing to spend time with me, and maybe she had something planned. But a mundane day of playing some games with her, she says she's going to go grab coffee with that guy at like 9pm and then hang out at her place after. And I was kinda taken aback. She has a lot of guy friends from back in college and I've never seen her do anything like that. I guess I did get a bit insecure, and I have felt that for another one of her guy friends in college I'll admit. So I asked her if there was anything and she kept saying no. Lastly, we've been planning to meet up at the end of the 3 month, which would involve me spending about a thousand dollars just for flight and hotel costs which is a lot of money as a college student. Before I proceed with this, I'm not sure about her behaviour and I do want some clarity. And in the past she's always said I can go through her phone and given me her password but I've never seen the need to snoop into any of her dms or anything. But this is making me super anxious and my friends say she might be cheating. I was initially inclined to trusting her but my friends keep saying I'm wasting time with her. AITAH if I ask to go through their dms on her phone to clear this up?

  
tldr: my LDR gf has been hanging out with this guy and making plans with him, which involved skipping on plans we had made before. Went on a late night cafe trip and they ""hung out"" at her place. I was initially inclined to trusting her but my friends keep saying I'm wasting time with her and shes cheating. AITAH if I ask to go through their dms on her phone to clear this up?

**Sara**

I stepped out into the cool evening air, my heels clicking against the pavement as I made my way to meet my boyfriend, Matt. The streetlights flickered to life, casting long shadows across the sidewalk.

A gentle breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of blooming jasmine. I inhaled deeply, savoring the sweet aroma. It reminded me of the perfume Matt had given me for our anniversary last year. The memory made me smile, but it quickly faded as I remembered why I was meeting him tonight.

My phone buzzed in my purse, interrupting my thoughts. I fished it out, fumbling with the zipper. ""Stupid tiny purse,"" I muttered. ""Who designed you, a chipmunk?""

The screen lit up with my friend Jessica's grinning face‚Äîa selfie she'd taken after one too many margaritas on last girls' night out.

""Speak of the devil,"" I muttered, swiping to answer. ""Jess, what's up?""

""Sara! Thank God you answered. Listen, I'm having a crisis.""

""What kind of crisis are we talking about? Did you run out of that overpriced face cream again?""

""Worse! I'm bored out of my mind. Want to grab a drink? I found this new place that does these amazing cotton candy martinis. They're like diabetes in a glass, but so worth it.""

""As tempting as that sounds, I can't. I'm on my way to see Matt. I haven't seen him properly in weeks. I need to talk to him.""

There was a pause on the other end. ""Is everything okay?""

I sighed, kicking a pebble as I walked. ""I don't know. He's been... distant lately. Always busy with work or too tired to hang out. I'm starting to wonder if he's allergic to my presence or something.""

""You need to talk to him. Find out what's going on. Communication is key, right? That's what all those cheesy relationship gurus say.""

""Yeah, I guess."" I kicked another pebble, imagining it was Matt's head. Childish? Maybe. Satisfying? Absolutely.

""Promise me you'll talk to him tonight. No chickening out!""

""Yes, mom. I promise I'll use my big girl words and everything.""

""Good. And hey, speaking of things that'll make you feel better ‚Äì have you heard about the new corporate finance professor?""

I frowned. ""No, why would that make me feel better?""

""Because, my dear Sara, rumor has it he's drop-dead gorgeous. Like, 'I'd actually show up to an 8 AM class for him' hot.""

""Jess, you realize he's still just a professor, right? No matter how hot he is, he's there to teach, not be eye candy for thirsty students.""

""Oh, come on! Don't be such a buzzkill. If he's that handsome, I might have to pursue him myself. Who says learning can't be fun?""

""You're impossible,"" I laughed, shaking my head. ""Besides, aren't you worried about the whole student-teacher power dynamic? It's kinda creepy. And I'm not interested in dating older professors. Period.""

""But what if he's young?""

""Still no. I'm not interested in professors, young or old, hot or not. End of story.""

""Fine, fine,"" she conceded. ""But when you're sitting in class, bored out of your mind, don't come crying to me about missed opportunities.""

""Trust me, I won't,"" I assured her, stopping at a crosswalk. ""The only thing I'll cry about in class is my GPA.""

""Speaking of crying,"" Jessica said, her tone shifting, ""are you sure you're okay? You know, with the whole Matt situation?""

I sighed, watching the traffic light change. ""I don't know. I guess I'll find out soon enough.""

""Well, if things go south, remember ‚Äì there's always that hot professor waiting in the wings.""

""Goodbye, Jessica,"" I said firmly, but I couldn't help smiling.

""Love you, babe! Call me later!""

I hung up, shaking my head as I crossed the street. Leave it to Jessica to try to set me up with a professor I'd never met. Sometimes, I wondered if she lived in the same reality as the rest of us.

As I approached the restaurant where I was meeting Matt, my stomach twisted into knots. What if he was breaking up with me? What if he'd met someone else?

I smoothed down my dress, suddenly wishing I'd worn something sexier.

The restaurant's warm glow spilled onto the sidewalk, beckoning me inside. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for whatever awaited me. Just as I reached for the door handle, my phone buzzed.

It was Matt.

Matt: Sara, I'm so sorry. Something came up at work. Rain check? I promise I'll make it up to you later. We'll spend the night together. Love you.

I stared at the screen, my emotions ping-ponging between relief and frustration. On one hand, he wasn't breaking up with me. On the other, he'd stood me up. Again. I got all dolled up for nothing. I should have taken Jessica up on those cotton candy martinis after all.

I looked down at my outfit‚Äîa cute little black dress that hugged my curves in all the right places, paired with heels that made my legs look a mile long. All this effort was wasted on the indifferent gaze of passersby and a wayward pigeon eyeing my shoes suspiciously.

""Don't even think about it, bird brain,"" I warned the pigeon. It cocked its head as if to say, ""Challenge accepted.""

As I walked home, my mind wandered to Matt's promise to 'make it up to me' later. A small thrill ran through me at the thought. Despite his recent distant behavior, Matt could be attentive when he wanted to be.

I remembered our last night together, how his hands had roamed my body, leaving goosebumps in their wake. How his lips trailed down my neck made me shiver with anticipation. The feel of his‚Äî

""Whoa there, tiger,"" I muttered, feeling my cheeks flush. ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves. He's got to show up first.""

Still, the promise of a passionate night together lifted my spirits slightly. This wasn't a total loss after all. I'd have time to prepare, to slip into something more enticing than this dress.

I grinned, already planning my outfit. Or lack thereof. Matt wouldn't know what hit him.

When I reached my apartment, my feet were screaming for mercy. I kicked off my heels, sighing in relief as my toes sank into the plush carpet.

I flopped onto the couch, sprawling out like a starfish. My dress rode up, revealing a generous amount of thigh, but who cared? I was blissfully alone in my apartment. No prying eyes, no judgments. Just me, my thoughts, and the blessed silence.

I closed my eyes, ready to drift off into a pizza-and-wine-induced coma, when my phone rang. The shrill tone pierced through the quiet, making me jump.

The screen lit up with a name I hadn't seen in ages. Claire? My high school bestie? We hadn't spoken in... well, longer than I cared to admit. What could she want?

I answered, my voice a blend of shock and eagerness. ""Claire? Is that really you?""

""Sara! Oh my God, it's been forever!"" Her voice crackled through the speaker, warm and familiar.

I sat up, smoothing down my dress. ""To what do I owe this blast from the past?""

""Oh, you know, just checking in on my favorite partner in crime,"" she chuckled. ""How are you holding up with the whole Matt situation?""

I frowned, confused. ""Matt situation? What are you talking about?""

""The breakup, silly. Don't tell me you're still in denial.""

""I hate to break it to you, but Matt and I are still very much together. In fact, we were supposed to meet for dinner tonight, but he got caught up at work.""

There was a long pause on the other end. So long, I thought the call had dropped.

""Claire? You still there?""

""Sara..."" Her voice was hesitant, almost pained. ""I don't know how to tell you this, but Matt's already dating someone. Victoria. I just saw them together at a pub.""

My heart dropped into my stomach. ""What? No, that's impossible. You must be mistaken.""

""I wish I was, honey. But I've got proof.""

My phone buzzed with incoming messages. With shaking hands, I put Claire on speaker and opened them.

""Oh. My. God."" The words escaped my lips in a strangled whisper.

Matt was on my screen. My Matt. With his arms wrapped around a stunning redhead, their bodies pressed so close you couldn't slide a credit card between them. And that was just the first photo.

# Chapter 2

**Sara**

I swiped through the images, each one a dagger to my heart. Matt and Victoria at a party, her hand on his chest. Matt whispered in her ear, a sly grin on his face. And the last one... let's just say if they'd been any closer, they'd have needed a pregnancy test.

""When... how long has this been going on?"" I managed to choke out.

""From what I've heard, a few months at least,"" Claire said softly. ""Victoria's an old friend from high school. Apparently, they reconnected at some work event. I thought you knew.""

""No, I had no idea. He's been... distant lately, but I never thought...""

""Men,"" Claire scoffed. ""They're all the same. Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile. Or, in this case, give them a work event, and they'll take a Victoria.""

Despite everything, I couldn't help but snort at that. ""Thanks, Claire. I needed that laugh.""

""Anytime, hon. So, what are you going to do?""

""I'm going to talk to Matt. Get the truth straight from the horse's ass‚ÄîI mean, mouth.""

""Be careful, Sara,"" Claire warned. ""Men like that can be smooth talkers when caught with their pants down. Literally and figuratively.""

""Don't worry, I'll be fine. I've got my big girl panties on."" I paused, glancing down at my outfit. ""Well, metaphorically speaking.""

Claire chuckled. ""That's my girl. Give him hell, and remember ‚Äì I'm just a phone call away if you need backup. Or an alibi.""

We said our goodbyes, and I hung up, staring at my phone. The last photo of Matt and Victoria stared back at me, mocking me with their intimacy.

I zoomed in on Matt's face, searching for any sign of guilt or hesitation. There was none. He looked... happy. Happier than I'd seen him in months.

I stood up, wobbling slightly as the blood rushed to my head. Or maybe it was the anger. Either way, I needed a drink. And a plan.

As I made my way to the kitchen, I thought about all the times Matt had canceled on me recently. All those late nights at work, those sudden emergencies, those ""rain checks"" that never seemed to clear up.

""Rain check, my ass,"" I grumbled, yanking open the fridge. ""More like a Victoria forecast with a chance of bullshit.""

I grabbed a bottle of wine, not even bothering with a glass. As I took a long swig, I caught my reflection in the microwave door. My carefully applied makeup was smudged, and my hair was messy from running my hands through it in frustration.

""Look at you,"" I told my reflection. ""All dolled up with nowhere to go. Meanwhile, Matt's playing tonsil hockey with Miss High School Reunion.""

I took another swig of wine, feeling it burn down my throat. The anger was building, replacing the initial shock and hurt. How dare he? How fucking dare he?

I stormed back to the living room, wine bottle in hand, and picked up my phone. My thumb hovered over Matt's contact info. Should I call him? Text him? Show up at the pub and catch him red-handed?

The possibilities swirled in my mind, each more dramatic than the last. I imagined myself bursting into the pub, wine bottle raised like a weapon, shouting, ""Aha! Caught you, you two-timing twerp!""

Or maybe I'd take the high road and send him a calm, collected text: ""Hey Matt, hope you're having fun with Victoria. By the way, your stuff is in a trash bag on the curb. XOXO""

Ultimately, I decided on a simple text: ""Hey babe, still stuck at work?""

I hit send and tossed my phone onto the couch, watching it bounce off a cushion. The wine bottle beckoned, and who was I to refuse? I took another generous swig, savoring the bitter taste that matched my mood.

Minutes ticked by. No reply.

""Probably too busy with his hands full of Victoria to check his phone.""

I flopped back onto the couch, a wine bottle dangling from my fingers. The room spun a little, and I realized I should slow down. Or at least switch to a glass like a civilized person.

""Screw it,"" I muttered, taking another swig. ""Civilized is overrated anyway.""

Just as I placed the bottle on the coffee table with all the grace of a drunken elephant, the doorbell rang. I froze, wine sloshing dangerously close to the rim.

""Who the hell...?"" I grumbled, stumbling to my feet.

I yanked the door open, ready to give the intruder a piece of my mind. And there he was. Matt. He looked annoyingly handsome in his work shirt and slacks, not a hair out of place.

""Hey, beautiful,"" he grinned, stepping inside like he owned the place. Before I could react, he planted a kiss on my lips. I stood there, stiff as a board, my lips pressed together tighter than a clam with lockjaw.

Matt pulled back, his brow furrowed. ""Everything okay, babe?""

""Oh, just peachy,"" I slurred, closing the door with maybe more force than necessary. ""How was work?""

""Busy as always,"" he sighed, loosening his tie. ""You know how it is. Deadlines, meetings, the usual crap.""

""Mhmm,"" I nodded, swaying slightly. ""Lots of... work stuff, huh?""

Matt's eyes narrowed, taking in my disheveled appearance and the half-empty wine bottle on the table. ""Sara, are you drunk?""

""Pfft, no,"" I waved dismissively, nearly smacking him. ""Just a little... wine.""

""Alright, let's get you some water.""

""Oh no,"" I said, my voice dripping with fake sweetness. ""What I need is an explanation.""

Matt froze halfway to the kitchen. ""Explanation? For what?""

I grabbed my phone from the couch, nearly dropping it in my wine-addled state. ""For this,"" I said, shoving the screen in Matt's face.

His eyes widened as he took in the photos. I watched his expression shift from shock to guilt to that infuriating 'caught' look.

""Oh, that,"" he said, as if I'd just shown him a picture of last week's grocery list. ""That's Victoria. She's just a friend from high school.""

""A friend? Really?""

""Sara, it's not what it looks like-""

""Oh, cut the crap,"" I interrupted, my words slurring slightly. ""It looks exactly like what it is.""

""Babe, please, let me explain-""

""Explain what?"" I spat, feeling my anger rise like bile in my throat. ""Explain how you've been too busy to see me because you've had your face buried in Victoria's pussy? Or maybe you'd like to explain why you've been lying to me for months?""

Matt reached out, trying to take my hand. I jerked away, nearly losing my balance in the process. ""Don't you fucking touch me,"" I hissed.

""Sara, I'm sorry. It just... happened. I never meant to hurt you.""

I laughed. ""Should we pop some champagne and celebrate your unintentional fidelity?""

Matt's face hardened. ""Look, I said I was sorry. What more do you want from me?""

""I want you to get the fuck out of my apartment.""

""Come on, don't be like this,"" Matt pleaded. ""We can work this out. It was just a mistake.""

I grabbed the wine bottle, brandishing it like a weapon. ""A mistake is buying skim milk instead of whole. A mistake is forgetting to set your alarm. Fucking another woman for months? That's a choice. A shitty, selfish choice.""

""Let's just calm down and talk about this like adults.""

""Oh, now you want to be an adult?"" I took another swig from the bottle. ""Where was this maturity when you played hide the salami with Victoria?""

""Sara, please,"" Matt tried again, his voice soft and pleading. ""I love you. We can get past this.""

For a moment, I faltered. A tiny part of me wanted to believe him, to fall into his arms and pretend this was all a bad dream. But then I remembered the photos, the way he looked at Victoria, and my resolve hardened.

""No, Matt. We can't."" I set down the wine bottle, suddenly feeling very sober. ""It's over. I want you out of my apartment and my life.""

""But-""

""No buts,"" I cut him off. ""Unless it's your butt walking out that door. Now.""

Matt stared at me, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. For a moment, I thought he might actually argue. But then his shoulders slumped, and he turned towards the door.

""Fine,"" he muttered. ""I'll go. But this isn't over.""

""Oh, it's over, alright.""

Matt's face twisted into a scowl, but he didn't argue. He just turned on his heel and stomped out, slamming the door behind him hard enough to rattle my wine glasses.

""Well, that went well,"" I muttered to the empty apartment.",1,1747272839.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

The rumbling engine of the tandem ski-plane awoke the huskies outside, who promptly abandoned their sleep for howling. Bain, the lead dog, only stirred from his post-meal slumber when Roy stood up from his armchair. His groan, the cursing under his breath, the cracking of bones, it was all louder than the approaching aircraft. He zipped up his coat and staggered towards the porch, Bain in tow, to watch the plane land.

The silver Auster slid to a stop on the snow, its skis leaving two remarkably shallow trails in its wake. The Frenchman, set off-kilter by his massive collection of luggage, jumped out in one fluid movement. ‚ÄúRoy! Salut! Salut!‚Äù he shouted, and began to run, full force. Before Roy could get a good look at his face, √âmile had kissed him, once on each stubbled cheek.

‚Äú√âmile,‚Äù Roy stepped back. ‚ÄúWelcome.‚Äù He opened the door, and three dogs stampeded past him to jump and lick at the face of the stranger. Roy smiled for a moment, as Emile struggled, trying to shoo the dogs away with his briefcase. Full grain leather, probably more expensive than anything in his small cabin, and utterly useless.

‚ÄúAttention,‚Äù Roy shouted, and the dogs ceased their play at once. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt used to strangers. Come in.‚Äù

Emile grinned furtively as he entered his new home, at least for the month. ‚ÄúThank you. Bon chien, bon chien.‚Äù

The cabin was warm and dark inside, lit only by the softly crackling iron stove and a single yellow lamp. The smell was a warm, woody mixture of musk, dust and dog fur. The walls were lined with trophies from races, old photographs, and a framed picture of the very newspaper article that had brought √âmile here.

Charles Roy Lisbon Jr.: Loneliest Man Alive. Anna Torrance. 1962.

‚ÄúYou can set your things down,‚Äù Roy grunted. ‚ÄúThe dogs won‚Äôt piss on them or anything, they‚Äôre well trained.‚Äù

‚ÄúJe vous, je vous, bon chiens.‚Äù He gave the black husky at his feet two quick pats on the head and placed his briefcase and other bags on the small, central table. ‚ÄúDo you speak French?‚Äù

‚ÄúComme ci, comme √ßa. Not since grammar school.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù √âmile brushed his hand through his silver hair, streaked with white. ‚ÄúI speak English fantastic. And I come bearing gifts.‚Äù He rummaged through bags, mumbling in French as he shuffled through various objects. In the end, he produced a bottle of fine aged wine, filet mignon, and Call of the Wild, signed by Jack London himself.

‚ÄúFor dinner of the body, and dinner of the mind,‚Äù he explained, his grey eyes glimmering. It sounded quite smart, he thought. Maybe something to put in the new book.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt read.‚Äù Roy pushed the book away, examined the wine, and took a swig off the top as Emile looked on with horror. ‚ÄúThanks, good stuff. So, what in the hell kind of business do you have here- paying me for some kind of vacation?‚Äù

√âmile threw himself onto a rickety chair and spread his arms wide. ‚ÄúI come to learn about life! True life! I have studied about urban living, I have studied about structuralism, materialism, Marxism- I have studied about life but I have yet to live it! I have lived all my life in the city, not once have I caught a fish or shot an animal, and I want to call myself the founding father of primitivology! Bordel de merde! Primitivology! My field, my only child. A return to essence, no governing body, no laws, man without structure! We, in modern societies, we trim hedges to be square, when in truth, the tree is more beautiful, more functional, when left alone. I am writing a book, the premier. I call it Man Without Structure: Primitivology.‚Äù

Roy stood, arms crossed. ‚ÄúWell, good luck with that. Last person who stayed here with me left and wrote that horseshit,‚Äù he gestured to the newspaper article on the wall. ‚ÄúShe locked herself in my outhouse for half her trip, said I was ‚Äòmean‚Äô and ‚Äòcoldhearted.‚Äô The ‚Äòauthentic life‚Äô was too much for her.‚Äù He used air quotes generously, but a wide grin spread across his square face.

‚ÄúC‚Äôest n‚Äôimporte quoi! Every man- woman, perhaps, too- fancies himself a Thoreau or a Twain, but I shall become better than Thoreau! I will sleep with the wolves and wash myself in the Great Lake, I will become the wild bison and imbibe the forest! I will do anything I must.‚Äù √âmile gestured with his entire body, his hands clenched as he leaned forward.

‚ÄúLake‚Äôs frozen,‚Äù Roy corrected, amused. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs no bison up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs but a m√©taphore, my dear!‚Äù

‚ÄúA what?‚Äù

‚ÄúA metaphor, in English! A thing, with something hidden under the surface. It is what I have come here to do. I shall find metaphor underneath the rocks and in the howl of the dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I see. Like ice fishing,‚Äù Roy smiled and winked.

√âmile threw up his arms again, ‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù Then he paused, thought for a moment, and laughed.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He grinned and stood up, throwing his thin arms around Roy‚Äôs neck and planting two more kisses on his cheeks. ‚ÄúMy dear Roy, you genius! Why yes, yes ice fishing. You are all too perfect, my pragmatist, my simple man untouched by the structure of society and such foolish things as literary devices.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù Roy stepped back again, ‚Äúbut I think I‚Äôll cook up this steak. I‚Äôm hungry.‚Äù



...



By the time dinner was served, only half of the steak was left. √âmile had watched, silently horrified, as Roy cut off sizable chunks of meat for each dog inside the cabin, and horrified once again when he saw the well-done meat on a cracked plate. Roy poured wine into two plastic cups and sat on his easy chair (there was only one wooden chair at the table). ‚ÄúLe d√Æner est servi!‚Äù

√âmile nodded, looking at his plate and bent fork. He poked at the meat and grimaced at the wine. He shooed a husky away from his lap. The dogs outside began to howl in the dark.

‚ÄúWhat do they howl for, Roy? Do they sing to the moon, longing for the wild, wolfish life of those before them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can smell the steak.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶ they hunger.‚Äù

The two men sat, listening to the dogs, the howl of the wind, and the crackling of the fire. They ate and drank without exchanging another word.

Finally, √âmile decided. ‚ÄúI shall sleep with the dogs tonight. Outside, under the same stars our ancestors hunted and struggled beneath.‚Äù

Roy nodded. ‚ÄúI think my ancestors would want me to sleep in my bed. But suit yourself. Your outfit looks warm enough for the antarctic.‚Äù √âmile was wearing outdoorsman‚Äôs clothing of the utmost quality, from his down jacket lined with fox fur to his merino wool underclothes.

‚ÄúCertainly, I selected the finest clothing! I shall see you in the morning. Please, do not let me in if I ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck. I‚Äôll wake you up early tomorrow morning- if you want to be Thoreau, you‚Äôll do some hard working.‚Äù

‚ÄúCertainly!‚Äù √âmile grabbed his sleeping bag and a journal and left the warm embrace of the cabin.

The stars were out. He allowed a dog to lick his face and petted its soft fur. √âmile, primitivologist, philosophe, modern Thoreau, poet of the wildmen.

But the cold doesn't care much for poetry.

He was on the floor inside within twenty minutes, wrapped in two dog blankets with his hands held up to the warmth of the furnace. On the gas stove, Roy had started a kettle for tea.

  
...



Roy woke the bundled Frenchman at 04:30: the same time he got up every morning to begin his daily tasks. ‚ÄúBonjour! Time to start your first day.‚Äù

√âmile groaned. He hardly slept last night. The dogs woke him every hour or so with their investigative pawing and sniffing. He began to protest about how it wasn‚Äôt even light out yet, and how he needed his coffee.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Thoreau would be complaining about getting up early. Come on, let‚Äôs let the dogs out, they need a piss.‚Äù √âmile straightened immediately and followed Roy and the dogs outside.

‚ÄúAlright, here‚Äôs the scooper, you clean up. I‚Äôm going to chop the firewood.‚Äù Roy handed him two wooden-handled metal tools.

‚ÄúClean what?‚Äù √âmile examined the two items.

‚ÄúTheir shit, what do you think?‚Äù

√âmile went pale. He had more questions, but Roy had already walked away, axe over one broad shoulder.

Holding the scoop like an √©p√©e, √âmile ventured towards the dogs, tethered next to their small wooden dens. The 20 or so dogs began their yipping and barking to the beat of Roy‚Äôs rhythmic chopping, wiggling with excitement at the new visitor.

‚ÄúShoo, shoo, down! Down! Attention!‚Äù √âmile shouted, remembering Roy‚Äôs command.

But they continued their roughhousing nonetheless as he attempted to clean.

‚ÄúIn every steaming pile, a mark of the beast- or no, perhaps, a little piece of man‚Äôs essence, a foul reminder of man‚Äôs core; a creature like the rest‚Ä¶‚Äù √âmile wrinkled his nose at the smell as he scooped. ‚ÄúMan is but dog, he fools himself with plumbing and calls himself civilized, but no! He creates waste just like the lowly mongrel, he too-‚Äù

A dog jumped, sending the faeces flying and toppling him over. A brown smear appeared on his down jacket. ‚ÄúPutain!‚Äù he shouted.

  
...

  


√âmile had recorded three learnings in his journal by nightfall:

In Canada, ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô refers to a black, soil-flavored drink

Dogs do not care how expensive your clothing is

A frozen outhouse is not a metaphor; it is a trap

Morning came too early once again. √âmile awoke to Roy and Bain‚Äôs faces, bright and ready for the next working day.

‚ÄúYour first sled training,‚Äù Roy skipped the bonjour and morning niceties. ‚ÄúGet ready.‚Äù

As they walked through the snow, harnesses and tethers in hand it was Roy‚Äôs turn to talk endlessly.

‚ÄúYou have to keep them trained all year round. That‚Äôs one of the ways my team‚Äôs different from the others- I have a real connection with the dogs. Most of the other racers leave their dogs at some kennel for the off season while they relax in Florida or something- they don‚Äôt train them the same. But me and my dogs, we‚Äôre family, we spend all year together and I keep their strength and endurance up that way.‚Äù

√âmile nodded. ‚ÄúI see, you are bonded with them. You can communicate as one whole unit- the boundary between you and nature, you and animalkind- it is not there, but it is for the others. And that is why they do not win.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôre right about something for once. Let‚Äôs see if you‚Äôve got the same instinct for harnessing the dogs up.‚Äù

He did not.

A dog named Cut had peed on his hand while he attempted to fasten the harness around his midsection, and he had pinched the skin of his forefinger in the clip while trying to harness another. But eventually, most of the 10 or so dogs were correctly tethered to the sled, Bain in the lead. Roy could have done it twice as fast on his own.

√âmile sat in the front of the sled, holding his notebook and pen. Roy stood in the back and shouted ‚ÄúHike!‚Äù

The sled picked up speed like a bullet as they raced down a snowy prominence. ‚ÄúHold on, froggie,‚Äù Roy said quietly before shouting another command. ‚ÄúHaw!‚Äù And the dogs veered to the left.

√âmile wrote in giant, looping letters as the sled drove over rocks and bumps. ‚ÄúWhat is haw?‚Äù He shouted over the sound of dogs panting and wooden skis crunching in snow.

‚ÄúLeft.‚Äù

‚ÄúAha! You communicate with the dogs and they understand your language so precisely, something as conceptual and human as left from right!‚Äù

‚ÄúSure do.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoy, I feel the wind of life in my hair! I have never before been alive! This is the most fantastic moment-‚Äù A small bump in the snow sent the small man, his notebook, and his pen flying.

Roy continued for a moment, rolled his eyes, and commanded the dogs to stop and turn back. √âmile was crawling on the snow, interrogating a dead bush on the whereabouts of his notebook and pen. Bain sniffed the top of his greying head. ‚ÄúPschtt!‚Äù He exclaimed.

Roy got off the sled. He located the pen and notebook with ease, brushed snow and dirt off the cover, and handed it to √âmile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot to learn this month, buddy. Get back on, let‚Äôs finish this run.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy body is broken and my spirit is crushed, I have lived but in living I have experienced death as well,‚Äù √âmile decided.

Roy laughed.

  
...

  


On that final Monday morning, Roy was silently mourning and searing a trout- the first √âmile had caught on his own- for breakfast.

It wasn‚Äôt until the fourth week that √âmile had become a somewhat natural presence in Roy‚Äôs little life. He had learned to chop wood and did a fair job of it- with supervision, of course. His shiny boots had grown dull, scuffed by work, and a shadow of a beard had appeared on his pointy, small chin. The dogs no longer reacted to his presence- they accepted him as a regular character, albeit one that was rather easy to work up and fun to paw at.

They had coffee together every morning after work, around 07:00. Roy would miss that expression of bitter distaste on the Frenchman‚Äôs face. He never did get used to black coffee.

‚ÄúOur final morning together,‚Äù √âmile sighed, contemplative. He leafed through the pages in his journal, filled with poetic musings, observations, and facts. The premise of his book, Man Without Structure: Primitivology was coming along quite nicely, though he had changed the title. Essence of Man. Roy certainly lived a structured life, and he could already imagine the critics tearing into the title.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been counting down the days, believe me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you joke, you always joke my dear friend! I will write often and with love,‚Äù √âmile assured, looking down at his mug filled with hot, smoky coffee.

Roy allowed himself to frown, his eyes welling with tears. His back was turned to the Frenchman as he stooped over the stove. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll write back, might take a while though, living all the way out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI shall visit as well! And I will bring steak, for us and for the dogs. My new book will be a bestseller, I can already tell. I can bring the finest of goods.‚Äù √âmile held up his fork as he made his declaration.

‚ÄúSend me a copy of your book too, if you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúI certainly will! But you said, you do not read?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt used to. I read that book you gave me. Think I might read more, you know, for company.‚Äù Roy admitted.

‚ÄúAh! You enjoyed it, no?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was fine,‚Äù he dismissed. ‚ÄúFish is done.‚Äù

They ate. √âmile was immensely proud of his catch- a small trout, more bones than meat- but he still shared it with the dogs beneath the table, just like Roy did.

The plane arrived late in the morning. Roy helped √âmile pack his things while they laughed and remembered stories from their month together.

At last, √âmile boarded the plane and tipped his hat to Roy. ‚ÄúThank you, sincerely.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Safe travels.‚Äù

Roy watched as the plane disappeared on the horizon. He patted Bain on the head. ‚ÄúGoodbye, damn froggie. See ya later.‚Äù

  
...

  


Two winters passed. It was 1963 and √âmile stood in front of a lecture hall. Bright eyed, young Harvard students watched intently as he cleared his throat at the podium. Some of them hugged dog-eared english translations of his book, The Essence of Man: Primitivology. Others looked unamused by the bearded, wild-eyed Frenchman in his down jacket.

‚ÄúIt is the 20th night, I am alone in the dark. I bring the dogs inside, for the cold had become too much even for the arctic acquainted husky. The night sky is empty and endless, and for the first time, I realize that the stars are stars.‚Äù

He paused. A cough, a sniffle in the audience.

‚ÄúIt was there, page 162, where I questioned the utility of metaphor and symbolic abstraction as a whole. Why not accept a star as a star, pain as pain, snow as snow? Is it not more beautiful, more real to view the world as it is?‚Äù

‚ÄúI went looking for a man without structure, a man in the natural state. But I found something different; a man with a natural rhythm, stronger than that imposed by bureaucracy or government, like the beating of the heart or the pull of each breath. His name is Roy Lisbon. He is a veteran of the second world war who brews the worst coffee in the world and feeds his dogs better than he feeds himself. He is quiet and in his silence he says more than I could in a book of a thousand pages. I will remember him forever, and so shall you.‚Äù

Quiet applause as √âmile closed his book.

As he stepped down from the podium, and slipped away, signing books and talking to eager students, his thoughts drifted northward, miles away, where dog and master rise at dawn.",1,1747272714.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1kmw2b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyCards/comments/1kmw2b1/my_suggestions_for_skycards/,My Suggestions for SkyCards,"# Things I think should be in Skycards

I‚Äôve become addicted to this game, and play it waaaaay too much. With that said, here are my suggestions. Many I've heard over and over; others I haven‚Äôt yet seen before.

Firstly, I think there should be some way to connect a FR24 account with Skycards - users with paid subscriptions could unlock additional features,¬† adding an extra incentive for people to subscribe.

# Cards:

**- Expanded rarities:** There should be more rarities. A 1/1 (like Stratolaunch or Boom) shouldn‚Äôt be the same rarity as an Airbus A220-100.

**- Expanded XP milestones:** Instead of just having paper, silver, and gold cards, I propose the following:

Paper: 0 - 9,999

Bronze: 10,000 - 24,999

Silver: 25,000 - 49,999

Gold: 50,000 - 99,999

Platinum: 100,000 - 499,999

Sapphire: 500,000 - 999,999

Diamond: 1,000,000 +

**- XP Leaderboard:** Display worldwide position of card XP - would incentivize people to max *every* card, not just rare ones or those that are meta in battles.

\- Add search to Deck.



# Battles:

* **Superlative Indicators:** Icons should be added to a card‚Äôs statistic if they are the highest/lowest for the given category (Stratolaunch would have show that its weight, wingspan, and rarity are the highest possible for their categories) - It would be best to have icons with different shapes/colors to indicate smallest vs largest.
* Players betting 0 coins shouldn‚Äôt be matched with those betting coins. Alternatively, a setting could be added allowing players to opt out of matchmaking with those who don‚Äôt bet.
* **Rematch** **Preclusion:** Guarantee two players can‚Äôt face each other back to back.
* Glow count should be compared after a tie in XP.
* Limit emoji spam to 10 per 5 seconds.



# Catching:

* **Item Quantity Count:** Show in parentheses next to its name; eg. USE ITEM: Catch Again (6)
* **Print Expedition:** Tapping the screen while a photo is printing skips the printing cycle (it‚Äôs annoying that it takes 5 seconds)
* Make coin collection after aircraft capture skippable with a tap



# Sounds:

* Add more soundtracks, and let users be able to select the one they like best.



# Achievements:

* **Progressive Achievements:** The *Gold Member* and *Silver Surfer* achievements are currently limited. Adding milestones for the amount of cards caught (3, 5, 10, 25, 50, etc) incentivizes players to level more cards up.
* New geographical achievements: - **Coffee Bean:** Brazilian states - **Taj Mahal:** Indian states - **Cactus:** Mexican states - **Matryoshka:** Russian oblasts
* Clicking on uncaptured aircraft types should lead to their airpedia page.
* Clicking on uncaptured countries should lead to their airpedia page.
* Organize the achievements so that similar types are together (continents, card, etc)



# Airpedia:

* Airports should be searchable, just like aircraft
* After selecting a continent, each country should have a captured airport count next to the arrow ‚Äú>‚Äù to see how many have been unlocked from the main continent page (ex: Argentina 10/48). This count should be colored to represent whether or not a country has been unlocked/completed (red for 0 airports, yellow for partially unlocked, green for fully unlocked)
* Add country flag to the left of it‚Äôs name (it‚Äôs easier to look for colors than text, even if it‚Äôs alphabetized).
* Add a toggle at the top of the continent list allowing users to switch to an interactive map view of the continents; it‚Äôs easier to click on Africa than look for it in a square in a seemingly random order.



# Aircraft:

* Each aircraft‚Äôs airpedia should show missing registrations (makes it easier to max out an aircraft)
* Swipe between 3 newest Jetphotos for a given registration upon preview on map (I like to see what a plane looks like)
* Maintain consistency between military variants being distinguished from civil aircraft (why is P-8 Poseidon given its own type, but C-32 is lumped in with 757?)
* Last seen date for aircraft in airpedia, which could redirect to FR24. If there‚Äôs an example active, it could have a button that filters live flights of that type



# Airports:

* In addition to 7-day leaderboards, add an all-time leaderboard, with cheaper travel given to players with higher positions.
* Players who aren‚Äôt in the top 10 of an airport leaderboard should still be able to see their ranking, just like in battles.
* Discounted travel to airports after catching a flight with it as a destination.
* After unlocking a new airport, the banner should go below the relocated/increased radar text



# New rewards for:

* Unlocking a new airport
* Capturing a new registration
* Capturing a new aircraft type



# Filters:

* Filter by uncaught aircraft type
* Filter by uncaught aircraft registration
* Filter by uncaught destination airport



# Leveling Incentives:

* increased default radar size
* increased default photo size
* lower costs to travel to airports
* Increased stabilization
* lower item costs? (may make game too unbalanced for newer players)

1kmw17g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydro101/comments/1kmw17g/indoor_gardening_on_a_budget_tips_tricks/,Indoor Gardening On A Budget: Tips & Tricks,"Indoor Gardening on a Budget: Creative Solutions for Small Spaces
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Indoor gardening can be a rewarding hobby, especially if you're working with a tight budget and limited space. You don't need a sprawling yard or a lot of money to grow vibrant plants or fresh herbs. Here are some creative solutions that can help you achieve a thriving indoor garden without breaking the bank.

### Start with Seeds

One of the most economical ways to begin your indoor gardening journey is by planting seeds instead of buying seedlings. Seeds are often much cheaper and can grow into strong plants with the right care. Consider starting with easy-to-grow herbs such as basil, mint, or parsley. These plants not only enhance your dishes but also help purify the air.

### Upcycle Containers

Instead of purchasing expensive pots, look around your home for containers that can be repurposed. Food containers, jars, and old mugs can make excellent planters. Just ensure they have drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating, which can lead to root rot. Here‚Äôs a list of potential upcycled containers:

- Plastic yogurt cups
- Empty tin cans
- Glass jars
- Old shoes or boots

### Optimize Small Spaces

If you're short on space, consider vertical gardening. This method allows you to make use of wall areas rather than table or floor space. You can hang potted plants on hooks, use wall-mounted shelves, or even create a DIY vertical garden with a wooden palette. A few plants cascading down can add beauty without taking up much room.

### Group Plants Strategically

In small areas, it's essential to use your space wisely. Group plants that have similar light and water requirements together. This not only saves time when caring for them but creates a lush, appealing look. You can arrange your potted plants on shelves, window sills, or side tables, maximizing the visual impact while minimizing the footprint.

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
### Shop Smart

When you do need to make purchases for your indoor garden, it's crucial to shop smart. Look for sales at local nurseries or online plant retailers. Many stores offer discounts on plants that are in season or during clearance sales. Also, consider joining local gardening groups. They often have plant swaps, giving you an opportunity to grow your garden for free!

### Choose Low-Maintenance Plants

Focusing on low-maintenance plants can save you both time and money. Some plants are naturally hardy and can thrive on less care. Consider these budget-friendly options:

- Snake Plant
- Pothos
- Spider Plant
- Jade Plant

These plants can tolerate varying light conditions and are less prone to diseases, making them ideal for beginners.

### Homemade Fertilizers

Instead of buying commercial fertilizers, you can create your own nutrients at home. Composting kitchen scraps like vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells is a great way to produce rich, natural fertilizer. Mix it into your plant soil to provide essential nutrients while also reducing waste.

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
### Create a Watering Routine

Regular watering is crucial, but it doesn't have to be costly or complicated. Set a schedule that works for you, and consider a self-watering system if you're often busy. You can create a simple self-watering planter using a plastic bottle by cutting off the bottom and inverting it into the soil. This way, your plants can absorb water gradually.

### Utilize Natural Light

Light is essential for plant growth, and using natural sunlight can save on electricity costs. Place your indoor garden near a window, preferably one that faces south for maximum exposure. If you don‚Äôt have enough natural light, consider growing plants that thrive in lower light conditions.

Indoor gardening on a budget is not only possible but also enjoyable. With these creative solutions and a little resourcefulness, you can turn your small space into a vibrant, green oasis without spending a fortune. Get started today! Your indoor garden awaits.

Affordable Tools and Resources for Thriving Indoor Gardens
----------------------------------------------------------

Creating a thriving indoor garden doesn‚Äôt have to stretch your budget. With a little creativity and resourcefulness, you can find affordable tools and resources that enhance your gardening experience. Here‚Äôs how you can cultivate your green thumb without breaking the bank.

### Start with the Basics

Before diving into expensive gardening tools, begin with the essentials. Having the right basic equipment can make gardening easier and more enjoyable. Here‚Äôs a checklist of items to consider:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Plant pots:** Look for second-hand options, or repurpose containers like jars or tin cans.
- **Soil:** Purchase a high-quality potting mix in bulk, which often offers better value.
- **Watering can:** You can use a simple bottle or jug to water your plants.
- **Pruning shears:** Basic scissors can work in a pinch for snipping and shaping plants.

### Utilize Natural Light

Good lighting is essential for indoor gardening, and you don‚Äôt need fancy grow lights to achieve this. Position your plants near windows that receive ample natural sunlight. South-facing windows usually provide the best exposure. If you have limited natural light, consider using:

- **Reflective surfaces:** Use mirrors or light-colored walls to boost available sunlight.
- **LED bulbs:** If necessary, invest in budget-friendly LED grow lights. They use less energy and can be found at reasonable prices.

### DIY Gardening Solutions

There‚Äôs a world of DIY solutions that can help minimize costs while maximizing the health of your indoor garden. Here are some ideas:

- **Composting:** Create a small compost bin using kitchen scraps. This provides rich nutrients for your plants.
- **Seed propagation:** Grow new plants from existing ones by branching out through methods like cuttings or using seeds from fruits and vegetables.
- **Plant food:** Nutrients can be sourced from kitchen leftovers, like eggshells for calcium or banana peels for potassium.

### Community Resources

Take advantage of community resources that are often overlooked. Local gardening clubs and online forums can offer free seeds, advice, and even tools. Here‚Äôs how to engage:

- **Join local gardening groups:** Many groups host seed swaps and workshops.
- **Utilize online platforms:** Websites like Facebook and Reddit have communities dedicated to gardening where you can ask questions and share tips.

### Repurposing and Recycling

Get creative by repurposing items around your home. This can not only save money but can also add a unique touch to your indoor garden. Here are some innovative ideas:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Food containers:** Use yogurt cups or egg cartons as seed starters.
- **Wine bottles or jars:** These can serve as attractive plant pots or watering devices.
- **Old furniture:** Turn a shelf into a plant stand for a vertical garden look.

### Efficient Watering Techniques

Managing your watering practices responsibly can help keep costs down. Two popular techniques are:

- **Self-watering planters:** You can create your own versions using plastic bottles to ensure your plants stay hydrated.
- **Collecting rainwater:** If possible, use a bucket to gather rainwater, which is free and nutrient-rich for your plants.

### Plan Your Garden Layout

Strategically planning your indoor garden layout can maximize space and reduce the need for excess tools and equipment. Consider the following:

- **Group plants by needs:** Place plants with similar watering and light needs together.
- **Vertical gardening:** Use wall spaces or vertical garden systems to save floor space.

By incorporating these affordable tools and resources into your indoor gardening routine, you can enjoy a lush, beautiful garden without overspending. Remember, the best part of gardening is experimenting and learning as you go. Happy gardening!

### Conclusion

Transforming your small space into a thriving indoor garden doesn‚Äôt have to cost a fortune. With creative solutions, you can maximize every inch of your home, turning even the coziest corners into flourishing green sanctuaries. Consider vertical gardening options like wall-mounted planters or shelves where pots can be arranged artistically. These solutions not only save space but also add aesthetic appeal to your living environment.

Equipping yourself with affordable tools is another vital step toward successful indoor gardening. You don‚Äôt need the most expensive gadgets to cultivate a healthy garden. Instead, focus on versatile items like DIY seedling trays, repurposed containers, and basic gardening tools that can be sourced from local dollar stores or second-hand shops. These resources can help you kickstart your gardening journey without stretching your budget.

Embrace the challenges and celebrate the small victories, knowing that every leaf and bloom brings you closer to creating your own green oasis. Don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment and find what works best for your lifestyle, and you‚Äôll see how easy it is to grow something beautiful indoors without breaking the bank.

ALL HAIL OUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRAVIS HUNTER. IT IS HE WHO WILL DELIVER US TO THE HOLY LAND. AMEN.

The stories rolling around in my head are stitched together by madness. Just kidding ü§£ they're stitched with my hopes and dreams, stardust and fervor, touchdown dances and quiet glances, heartbreak and healing.

I wanted to share a peek at the projects living rent free in my head:

1. Nova & Orion ‚Äì A cozy, magical romance set in Oriana, a seaside city where magical football is everything. Nova is a sweet barista who brews more than just coffee‚Äîhe uplifts Orion, a rookie quarterback shouldering the weight of a lost season. This is my warm blanket of a story: soft, healing, and filled with dreamy love, sparkling lattes, and a city that lives and breathes the game.

2. Solryn & the Arcstars ‚Äì A big-hearted magical sports saga about Solryn, a sunshine quarterback with hidden celestial powers, and his team, the Arcstars. They‚Äôre underdogs chasing redemption after seasons of scandal and sorrow. Think Final Fantasy meets Friday Night Lights‚Äîwith crushes, cosmic revelations, and a rival who might just change everything. There‚Äôs a dreamy GM, teammates with secret feelings, and a firestorm of emotions both on and off the field.

3. Blaze Bounce ‚Äì The firework prince of the idol world! Blaze is a magical music student who transforms into a fiery hero with cosmic flair. It‚Äôs glitter, sparkles, and heart-thumping pop battles‚Äîbut beneath the glam is a tender journey of self-worth and rising from ashes.

4. Rio Vega & the Smoothie Magic ‚Äì My newest project! Rio runs Bliss Blends, a smoothie shop in Jacksonville with mysterious (and maybe magical?) vibes. He‚Äôs a football-loving ray of sunshine who might just be blending more than fruit‚Äîhe‚Äôs stirring hope, joy, and maybe a little fate into every cup. Romance, community, and spiritual sweetness all swirl together here.

These stories are my huddle against the hard times. They remind me of the magic in underdog comebacks, the poetry of a perfect throw, and how love can feel like a game-winning drive with 10 seconds on the clock.

1kmvy4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kmvy4g/aita_for_not_wanting_my_partner_to_meet_other/,AITA For not wanting my partner to meet other girls for drinks?,"I (33F) have been with my partner (39M) for around 18 months now. We met at work and just clicked right away and our relationship felt so natural and comfortable from the get go.
He's a lot different to my ex of 11 years who was a little bit more introverted with a small group of close male friends. He's a lot more social with a wide range of friends and actively meets up and chats often daily with some of them. I think it's great to have your own social life and it's important to maintain a healthy relationship. He's a really personable, liberal guy and is easy to connect to, which is part of the reason why I fell in love with him.

We recently were having a chat about one of his female friends who was a colleague with him before I started (she'd left by the time I started work there). He was talking about a time before we were together that he met with her for drinks one evening and he walked her back to her apartment she shared with her boyfriend as she was so drunk and went home. I mentioned that I would feel a bit uncomfortable if I were her boyfriend that she was out with just 1 male friend for evening drinks. He scoffed at me and suggested that I would have no reason to as he saw her as more of a little sister and would never cross that boundary, which I totally get. But the point I was making and the one he was missing, was that I feel like there's something a little more 'intimate' about meeting a friend of the opposite sex for evening drinks. Meeting for coffee, lunch, a walk or whatever isn't really the same as drinking together (although he insists it's  not like they go to get pissed intentionally).
Again, I have no issue with having friends of the opposite sex, but is it unreasonable of me to have that boundary? Something doesn't sit right with that  scenario to me if you're in a relationship. I personally, would never meet up with a guy friend for a night and leave my partner at home because that seems wrong. I'm not an insecure person but I feel like I am being by the way he is telling me that I'm wrong for thinking that way.

I even suggested that sometimes a good friendship might be misconstrued and thought to be developing in to something else, but he insists that if he doesn't feel that way about them, then what does it matter? That's a 'them' problem, and he loves me so who cares what anyone else thinks as I'm the one he wants to be with. 

Note, when we first got together he was almost 'best friends' with a girl he previously slept with but realised it wasn't for him and they became friends. I told him that it's not that easy for a girl to just switch her feelings off and be friends and I had that gut feeling that she still liked him. They'd regularly meet up and go to gigs and markets etc (more so before we got together). I refused to meet with her when they arranged to go to a gig and said I thought it was strange he wanted me to be friends with someone he'd been intimate with, regardless if we'd 'get along really well' in his opinion. Turns out my gut feeling was right as she later told him she loved him and thought he should give them another go. He said no and explained he was in love with me and they can no longer be friends now knowing this, and proceeded to block her on everything. I hoped by me flagging this previously, he'd have some more faith in my intuition.

So what do I do? I don't want to come across as some controlling partner who says no to him meeting friends, as that's not the point I'm making, I just think there's a time and a place that's appropriate for certain people and that should be as part of respect for a relationship that you're in. I absolutely trust that he would never do anything inappropriate or cheat on me as he's just not that type of person. But it's hard to shake an uncomfortable feeling about a specific scenario. 

I think of it like, if my Mum went for drinks with a guy friend and left my Dad at home, I'd be weirded out by that. Friendly catch up or not, it just feels a bit disrespectful.

Chapter 1: Very Gorgeous Man

Joanna

I woke up to the sound of my alarm slowly getting louder and I waited for the chiming bells to stop before I rolled over and hit the screen. With a deep breath, I muster the energy to get out of the bed and drag myself to the shower. I had a job interview today and I needed to be there early so that I won't be labeled as a late comer. Quickly taking my shower, I did my morning routine before getting myself ready for the day and headed to the venue where the interview will be held.

I got there almost before eight-thirty in the morning, the interview is scheduled for nine in the morning. I always like to be early, I hated doing things at the rush hour. But now, my patience is running out and my legs are bouncing up in frustration. It is already half past nine yet no one showed up and I have been waiting for more than an hour.

After several months of job hunting and my years in the university. I am finally getting the opportunity to work in one of the biggest companies in the country, Dangote Group of industries. When I was twelve years old, I read about two brothers, Griffin and Justin Creed who started the company years ago right out of college.

I followed the company from that time on, I got my General Education Development at the age of fifteen and got full academic scholarships to one of the top universities in the country. After several years of schooling, I finally got my degrees and masters. And when I reached a point where I felt qualified on the educational level, I tried to find a job in the company but I had no luck.

It has been ten months since I finished my last degree and aside from some very low-paying internship, I have been out of luck on the job front. For the past four months, I worked at a struggling coffee shop and tried to use my expertise to help keep the door open.

Right when I started working at the coffee shop, I saw a job vacancy at Dangote Group of industries and applied instantly. After three months of waiting, I was finally called in for an interview when I was about to give up on hope. But the bakery was able to keep gas in my car and I was able to make minimum payment on my loans but I was almost homeless and had barely any money in my name.

So here I am, waiting for almost an hour. I let out a sigh and checked my watch again, who knew a place so established like this company would keep me waiting this long? I glance around the lobby, there was a security team at one desk near the door and a receptionist on the other side in the section I was sitting. The place was stark white with light blue and silver accents, luckily the chairs were comfortable. The receptionist, a petite blonde girl glance at me and send a sympathetic smile for the millionth time, if only she would stop looking at me and fucking call someone to assist me.

I checked my time again, and it was almost ten o'clock. And just as I was about to go talk to the receptionist, the elevator on the right side of the desk pinged and opened and a very gorgeous man stepped off and headed in my direction.

Holy hell, he had dark hair and beautiful ocean blue eyes. He walked towards me as if he was walking down a runway, model perfect and gorgeous in a crisp dark brown suit with gold cuffs.

""Miss, Clover?"" He said in a deep voice that had the hint of an accent. He extended his hand and I took his hand in a handshake.

He stood a few inches over my height in heels, I snaked my eyes up his chest till I met his sparkling eyes. They were clear blue like the sky and held me captivated.

""Hello,"" I said, sliding my hand out of his and he stared at me for a second too long before blinking slowly.

""I am Logan Walker, one of the partners here."" He said smiling softly showing two dimples in his cheeks.

A small pang of disappointment hit me, there were only pictures of Justin Creed and I don't know what Griffin looked like but I was hoping the man that was in front of me, the one that would be interviewing me would be him but I was wrong.

""I am sorry for the delay, I was just told you were down here waiting. We were training some new assistant who apparently did not know how to relay a message."" He said, the more he spoke, the more I realized he had a Greek accent. He is not from this country.

""Come with me, let's head to my office. I am not a fan of big impersonal meeting rooms for one-on-one interviews."" He said, gesturing towards the elevator, I nodded and grabbed my bag and credentials.

When he turned his back to head to the elevator, I fixed my clothes. I had been sitting for so long, when my mother was alive, she had so many amazing outfits and this piece I am wearing now was one of them. It was a crop jacket and high waist pants suit in black soft wool, it was probably my favorite. I added a white tank that I found at the thrift store, it was also cropped so I had to make sure I pulled it down so that my mid drift didn't show. I added some strappy silver heels that made me feel mature and sophisticated.

I put my curly hair in a loose bun and did light makeup. I wanted to hide my freckles because it made me look younger. I watched his back as he walked, he had to be one of the handsomest men I had ever met. He was lean but he had an athletic build and the suit fit him like a glove. He has a very nice ass too, if I took a guess, I would place him just over six feet.

A few inappropriate thoughts flew through my head. He could fold me like a pretzel. Fuck, why did I just think that?

I hurried to catch up to him, my heels sounded way too loud on the beautiful marble floor. The elevator doors were opening by the time I caught up and I hurriedly followed him on. He raised an eyebrow in my direction, causing me to flush and the corner of his mouth tipped up a little bit.

# Chapter 2: He Has Effect On Me

Chapter 2: He Has Effect On Me

Joanna

""Did you have to travel far?"" He asked, turning to face me. He reached across and hit the twelfth floor and the elevator door closet silently.

""Four hours,"" I said quickly and he lifted a brow.

""I drove here by myself,"" I added and he lifted his other brow, a look of slight surprise filling his face.

""Alone?"" He asked softly.

The tone of his voice made me pause, I glanced up onto his eyes and that was a mistake. His ocean blue eyes held onto my gaze with an intensity that took my breath away. I had to look away and clear my throat, I could feel my face getting even more red and my skin may be light golden brown but when I flushed, it was so noticeable. Shit, I should have worn heavier makeup at this point.

""Hmm, yes. I do most stuff alone these days."" I responded, studying the elevator buttons as if something was interesting about them.

He didn't say anything for a long moment and when I glanced at him again, I noticed he was studying me with a curious gaze.

""Where did you come from?"" He asked, breaking the silence.

""Surulere, I grew up there."" I replied as the elevator pinged and the doors slid open quietly.

He gestured for me to step out first, I heeded and he followed me closely. I could feel the heat of his body on my back, he took a step around me and started walking straight down the hall. The colors were similar to the first floor, however there was no receptionist or security desk. Just a long spacious hallway.

""All the partners work on this floor, it is easier for us to have meetings and whatnot. The first room is the conference room, just big enough to accommodate fifteen people and across from it is a lunchroom and a small kitchen. It is barely used because we usually eat out during lunchtime or just eat in our offices."" He said, gesturing at the two rooms that were the first we came to.

They were see-through floor-to-ceiling glass doors and walls. From what I could tell, they were all identical in that nature and I am not sure why he was giving me a tour of this floor.

""We have four different sections that oversee the company, each has two panthers. Rodrigo and I are the lawyers here, we have an entire floor of lawyers who answer to us but we are the ones who give the final say in all legal matters that got on here at the company. You will be meeting Rodrigo tomorrow."" He said, stopping in front of the next set of doors and I could see the names printed across each of the doors. Logan Walker, SJD and across the hall, Rodrigo Sawyer, SJD.

""SJD? That is impressive."" I murmured.

SJD, Doctor of Juridical Science is a very specially awarded law degree, one of highest one could get. He grinned, a boyish look overcoming him and for the first time, it was as if he broke character, whatever character he had been playing.

""Not many people know what those letters stand for, I guess I should not be surprised that you do.""

I blushed again, he gestured for me to continue down the hall with him. I thought about what he said, he wasn't surprised I did. Unsure of what it meant, although curious I decided not to ask too many questions today at least not yet. We walked towards another set of doors.

""You can pick which side but this section is for the employee and company management team. We do not have anyone in that role so whichever side you prefer will be yours."" He said, opening the office on the left side of the hallway.

I froze, did he say pick a side? I haven't even been interviewed for this job yet much less the partner's secretary position.

""I wasn't aware this role is was for a partner position."" I stated, he gestured for me to enter the office.

""It was not really, we like to promote from within. However when the Creed brothers looked over your resume, they were impressed with your accomplishments at such a young age and were too qualified for the secretary position...."" He paused and his eyes roamed over my body for a moment.

Gosh, no one has ever openly looked at me like that.

""We don't have anyone as acting partner in tho role and we want to offer you the position on a trial basis. It has been vacant for three months and it has taken a big toll on Justine and Griffin. Right now, we do not have anyone who we feel can fill the role that is already working here.""

I am pretty sure my mouth dropped open at his words. After months of searching for an entry-level position, I had just been offered my dream job. I slowly stepped into the office, still too stunned to form a word. There were four big floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the city and the view was fantastic. I walked up to the window and put my hands on the glass, taking a deep breath. For a moment there, I forgot everything and just processed the situation.

I felt tears trying to poke through my eyes, could this really be happening? I breathed in a few more deep breaths, trying to push the tears back as I didn't want Logan to see me like that.

""You should see the view at night, it is even more amazing. I highly recommend this side of the building, the other side has a nice view but not as good as this one."" He said in a soft voice and he sounded like he was right behind me.

I spun around, he was standing so close that I almost got flushed to his chest. The corner of his eyes flicked down to my mouth and then back to my eyes before he took a step back.

""Each office has a closet and a private bathroom."" He added and I looked down for the first time.

There was a desk and comfy looking office chair off to the side so that when you sat down, one could view out the window. There was also a rather comfy looking couch around a small corner in the office near the window. Across it were two doors, I walked over to them and opened one first. When he said closet, I was expecting a small broom closet but it was a large walk-in closet almost the size of my bedroom back home.

Who had that many clothes beside celebrities and for work? The door on the left side, I went over and opened it. It was the bathroom, it was also big with a nice walk-in shower and lots of counter space. There was even a linen closet with towels and washcloths and a few hotel style white robes.

It's autumn. The air is cool. Outside smells of wet dirt and fresh rain. The roads are soaking. The windows are down, and the wind blows through my hair, sending a chill over my skin.

He reaches over and grabs my thigh. I melt under the touch of his hand. I place my hand on his. I smile as I look down‚Äîthe ring on my finger, glistening even on this dark, cloudy day, is a perfect reflection of how I feel in this moment.

I'm so in love with him. And we're finally married. Eloped. Just him and me. It was intimate, perfect. We‚Äôll cherish the memory of a time when the world knew nothing of our marriage‚Äîwhen it was just ours to hold, ours to live in together.

Today is October thirtieth. Tomorrow is Halloween. Everything is so perfect right now. I want to bottle this feeling and drink it whenever I need to remember this kind of joy.



I hope he knows just how deeply I love him. I can‚Äôt even tell you how long I yearned for a love like this.

He saved me. He genuinely saved me.

I was so broken before him‚Äîand honestly, I‚Äôm still a little bit in pieces. I‚Äôm relearning emotions. Relearning what it means to be safe, to be wanted, to be loved.

It‚Äôs hard.

Some things are still so complicated.

My trust? Shattered. Everyone in my life has lied to me in some way. Everyone.

But I‚Äôm learning. I‚Äôm getting better.

He shows me, every single day, what real love looks like. What it feels like. What it sounds like.

Love‚Äîtrue love‚Äîshould never be confusing or painful or conditional.

And he gets it.

He knows I come from a hurt place.

Love is a learning process‚Äîand it‚Äôs one you never really finish.



""Where are we going?"" he asks, a smile playing on his lips.

God. That smile. That smile could light up even the gloomiest day. It melts me. (Have I said that already?)

""Hmm,"" I ponder. ""Maybe we go home and watch some cheesy Halloween movies? Tomorrow is Halloween, after all. This could be our anniversary tradition. Instead of going out and spending a ton of money, we could do dinner and a movie at home.""

""You know,"" he says, ""that actually sounds really nice. It‚Äôs been a long, momentous day‚Äîand that sounds like the perfect way to end it.""

I smile and take his hand. I turn to look out the window.

It‚Äôs raining harder now.

I love the rain, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I hate being in the car during downpours like this. The roads get slick. People forget how to drive. It's just... scary, you know?

He pats my leg.

""Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll get wrinkles,"" he says with a chuckle.

I dart my eyes toward him.

""Was it that obvious?"" I ask, a little embarrassed.

Sighing, I add, ""You know how people are when the roads are wet. I‚Äôm not worried about your driving. It‚Äôs everyone else I don‚Äôt trust.""

""Just try not to think about it. We‚Äôre almost home,"" he says, placing both hands back on the wheel.



That‚Äôs easier said than done.

But we live in a small town, thank God.

I grew up in the city‚Äîit was chaos.

The streets congested with people, noise, fumes... The hustle and bustle had a way of drowning out your own thoughts.

But here, in Maple Ridge, I can finally think.



I‚Äôm lost in thought when the clicking of the blinker pulls me back.

Thank God. We‚Äôre home.



Our home isn‚Äôt perfect, not by any means, but I love it.

It‚Äôs my sanctuary.

Gravel crunches beneath the car. I love that sound.

The maple trees‚Äînow glowing orange and yellow‚Äîtower around us as we make our way down the long, winding driveway.

And then I see it: our little farmhouse, revealing itself like a storybook secret.



A rustic, two-story gem standing proudly in the middle of our own little forest.

The weathered wooden panels tell stories of seasons past‚Äîeach crack and crevice etched with time and character.

A wraparound porch adorned with jack-o‚Äô-lanterns welcomes us home, their warm glow flickering against the evening mist.

Behind the house, our old barn sits faded and humble. I imagine it was once a fiery red in it's glory days. Now it‚Äôs muted. Definitely in need of a paint job‚Äîmaybe this summer.



The car rolls to a stop and the doors click open.

I reach for the handle, but he stops me.



""No!"" he says sharply.

Startled, I gasp. ""What is it?!""

He clears his throat, trying to hide a grin.

""We‚Äôre married now. Let me get the door for you.""



I wait as he walks around and opens the door, offering his hand.

""Madam,"" he says playfully.



I laugh.

""Oh, you‚Äôre so silly,"" I say, placing my hand in his.



The crisp autumn air digs into my skin as I step out.

God, I love this time of year. It‚Äôs my absolute favorite.

Even more now that our wedding anniversary falls in the heart of fall.

Just one more reason to celebrate the season.



I hate summer. The heat, the bugs, the sweat.

If I could live in autumn forever, I would.



We reach the front door, and he fumbles for the key.

As he unlocks the door, he turns to me.

""You know what I have to do now, right?"" he says, flashing a sly grin.



""Oh geez. No, you definitely don‚Äôt have to do that,"" I protest.



Before I can finish my thought, he‚Äôs scooped me up into his arms.

""Aww, come on,"" he says. ""It‚Äôs tradition! The groom carries the bride over the threshold. It‚Äôs good luck or something.""



I roll my eyes and kiss his cheek, my arms looped around his neck.

""Okay, fine, fine. You may carry me across the threshold,"" I say with mock seriousness.



He grins, opens the door, and carries me inside.

The smell of pumpkin spice hits me immediately.



It‚Äôs warm and rich and nostalgic‚Äîlike every autumn from my childhood all at once.

The door clicks shut behind us, sealing out the cold, and suddenly the quiet crackle of a fire fills the space. He must‚Äôve remembered to set the timer before we left‚Äîthe fireplace is already glowing, golden embers flickering against the stone hearth like they‚Äôve been waiting for us.



The house is cozy and dim, lit mostly by the flames and a few low lamps casting amber halos on the walls. A soft throw blanket is tossed over the back of the couch, and little autumn touches are everywhere‚Äîtiny pumpkins on the coffee table, cinnamon sticks in a jar by the window, a flickering candle on the mantle labeled harvest spice. The scent wraps around me like a hug.

Outside, the wind whistles through the trees, but in here, it‚Äôs calm. Safe.



We‚Äôre home.

Last fall, when I was feeling down, I did something that seemed crazy -
I took off my shoes in the most leaf-dead corner of the park and walked barefoot through the wet soil.
No guided meditation, no energy ritual, just letting my feet feel:
- The pure softness of rotting leaves and the toughness of new mycelium
- The roughness of gravel between toes.
- The subtle pulsation of the earth's temperature through the soil.

The obsidian bracelet my friend gave me was originally for decoration, but it accidentally slipped into my palm while I was walking.
Touching its cold surface, I suddenly remembered the streamside stones I stepped on when I ran barefoot in my childhood.
At that moment I understood: nature never stops healing us, but we often forget to take off our shoes and let go.

- Or even just watching the sunset fall on the curtain wall of the office building, reflecting the luster of rainbow-like quartz.

1kmvus5,https://i.redd.it/g967b10hju0f1.jpeg,It is not my world .,"Two nights ago, we went out to the desert to enjoy the desert and the moonlight shining on the mountains and hills, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. When we arrived at the designated spot, we found a high place covered in clean and soft sand, allowing us to sit directly on it without any cushions for the full sitting experience. We then unpacked our coffee and tea supplies, as well as our cooking utensils, with us bringing lamb meat to prepare dinner. Our dinner consisted of lamb ribs with rice, and since I am passionate about preparing this delicious dish, I made it with precision using the specific spices for such local and famous dishes. While I was preparing, my friend lit the fire to prepare the coffee and tea. Then he brought out some watermelon, cut it, and placed it on the front of the car to cool down naturally, giving it a nicer taste than if it were from a fridge or cooler. We enjoyed our beautiful dinner, then gathered around the fire to share stories, funny memories, traditional tales, poetry, and epic stories in the depths of the desert, discussing how desert dwellers used to travel thousands of miles without changing the landscape - the mountain was the mountain and the valley was the valley until their death. The only changes were made by the people and animals around them, while the rest of their surroundings remained constant. We joked about how a desert dweller returning from the past to our rapidly changing and frightening world would likely say, ""This is not my world, and this is not the desert I know.""

1kmvu4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1kmvu4t/scared_im_making_it_up/,Scared I‚Äôm making it up,"I have suffered with pelvic pain, a burning bladder, horrible stomach cramps, constipation, fatigue, intense abdominal bloating, urinary frequency, and general pain for 4 years. I have been to pelvic floor pt, get monthly pelvic floor injections, cut out gluten/dairy/coffee/caffeine/every bladder irritant ever, and still am far from normal. 

Around age 19, the fall of my freshman year of college, my body changed suddenly. I started having horrible gi and bladder issues and bloating; I had experienced a minimal amount of this before but it was suddenly debilitating. I spent a year suffering in silence; it led to a lot of trauma. I tried cutting out dairy, which helped, very minimally. After my mom caught me during a horrible flare up where my stomach was rock hard and I was peeing every five minutes, I went to the ER. At the ER, my imaging was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I was sent to a GI doctor, then eventually to pelvic floor PT after complaining about my bladder/ constant discomfort there. Although pelvic floor PT helped, I am so far from normal. I have since cut out coffee/caffeine/all bladder irritant. However, it seems like the more I treat it, the worse I feel. I have had improvement from pelvic floor PT and cutting out foods/drinks, but I still experience intense pelvic discomfort, a burning bladder, urinary urgency, constipation, intense bloating, just horrible pain. 

I do not remember what ‚Äúnormal feels like‚Äù. I have episodes of burning and such intense urinary frequency that I am debilitated. From age 19-20, I spent nearly an entire year at home because I could not go 10 minutes without needing to pee. I almost dropped out of college because I was struggling so much; I was horribly depressed and lost most of my friends, could not perform, could not be social, and would wear baggy clothes constantly. 

Even after improvement, I feel uncomfortable almost everyday. Also, my whole life I have had heavy periods and terrible cramps and pain. I used to have to leave school due to the severity of it. 

I have spent so much time and energy on getting better, yet it seems no doctor can help me as my labs are ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. My SIBO test came back negative, my allergy tests are clear, I do not have celiac. To be tmi, my fecal test came back clear as well.

I am at a loss. My recent ER visit showed ‚Äúnormal‚Äù imaging, except free fluid and blood in my pelvis and abdomen, which they said was likely from a recent ovarian cyst. My mom had endometriosis and we started to piece together some of my history. Since then, I have been to the gynecologist, my regular urogynecologist who does my monthly injections, and an obgyn who is highly skilled in MIGS. Every doctor has seen my imaging and history and thinks that endo is likely. My recent gyn exam also showed that my uterus is tilted backwards.


After discovering that endo can cause so many of my issues, I realized I have unconsciously made great efforts to work around my cycle. Without even knowing about endo, I tend to avoid scheduling trips/performances for the week before my period due to fear of flare ups/pain. Every month I get so constipated the week before my period, and my bladder symptoms are much worse. The bloating and pain are terrible. Also, I have great discomfort pooping during my period. I monitored my body/symptoms during my last period to see how I felt. I realized then how horrible the pain is in my lower back, stomach, and butt area. It hurts so bad, like a shooting pain to my butt, and it doesn‚Äôt feel better after I am done going to the bathroom.

I also have struggled with chronic acid reflux and shortness of breath, but I had attributed that all to anxiety. During my last cycle, I realized how hard it is to breathe the week leading up to, and during my period. Day one of my last period I struggled so hard to take a deep breath that I was panicking. I am again experiencing that today (1 week until my period); I had not connected that it may be related to my cycle.

I have lived with pain for so long that I do not remember what normal feels like. I took naproxen for the first time last month before bed, and woke up in the middle of the night because it had worn off and my pain was so bad. Even after having seen several doctors who seem convinced about endo, I feel so scared to be wrong. I have been told I am ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and that nothing is wrong for so long that I have great anxiety and mistrust.

I know that something is very wrong. Even with use of ADHD meds that calm me down (this is a new development, has helped somewhat), my pelvic floor wand, supplements, and dietary changes, I am far from normal. My life is very limited and I am not the person I used to be. Even when I have gained/lost weight, my lower stomach protrudes in a noticeable way that it did not when I was a teenager.

At my appointment with the OBGYN who is trained in MIGS, I went in and he had done a thorough history of my charts and asked great questions. He seemed very sure that I have endo and I was scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy with excision if endo is found, a hysteroscopy with biopsy, and a cystoscopy. 

He is a great provider! However, even though he is well versed in endometriosis, he works with it less often than this new provider I found. There is another OBGYN near me who is trained in MIGS, and is the head of the Chronic Pain Center. She mostly works with endometriosis and excision surgery, and is very thorough; she can also treat holistic pelvic pain. They scheduled me for an appointment next Wednesday, and I have to fill out a 14 page pelvic/reproductive related packet about my history. I have not canceled my surgery yet as the scheduler hasn‚Äôt called me yet, and I want to leave my options open. However, I think I am leaning towards doing my lap with the more endo focused OBGYN. I could use advice on this if you have recommendations!

While I think endo is likely, I feel scared again. Despite multiple providers agreeing endo is likely, I have been told that I am ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for so long that I am afraid that I have to go through another consultation. Reviews all say that she is a very compassionate provider, but I am just so exhausted, physically and mentally. I have lived in pain for so many years that I do not know how to differentiate between what is normal and what is intense pain. My pain definitely increases leading up to, and during my period, but I am used to suffering.

I guess I share all of this in hopes that I am right, and that endo is what‚Äôs making me feel this way. I am scared that this provider will think I am crazy or dramatic. I am so scared to be wrong again! I just want to not feel this way anymore. I have read dozens of experiences of people with endo (many from this reddit!), that I relate to. I have not encountered any other condition that sums up my experience and symptoms so well.

If you have read this far, I am grateful. I am only 22 and I feel so alone and at a loss. My health has totally shifted my life, how I live, and what I believe I can achieve realistically. I spent last year ‚Äúmanaging‚Äù aka suffering in silence as I have accepted that ‚Äúthis is just my life now‚Äù. After an episode where I peed 18 times in one day, I had a breakdown. Even if I am wrong, I need to try. I cannot go on living the way I do now :(. Don‚Äôt worry, I have discussed this in therapy and spent a lot of time journaling; however, nothing makes the grief and isolation go away. 

If my story resonates with you, or you have anything positive to say, or any tips, please feel free to reply. This community has been very eye-opening and ultimately led me closer than ever to an answer. Thank you all for your time <3",1,1747271525.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False

Instead, consider drinking cumin water for a healthier alternative. What you consume first thing in the morning directly impacts your health, and cumin water is known to aid weight loss by boosting metabolism and reducing obesity. This refreshing drink can also help alleviate various health issues, making it an excellent choice for your morning routine.

Cumin is packed with antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal properties that can strengthen your immune system. Drinking cumin water can help relieve gas, acidity, and bloating, while also curbing your tea cravings.

Benefits of drinking cumin water include:

* Helps in weight loss: Starting your day with cumin water enhances metabolism, improves digestion, and increases nutrient absorption, all while burning stored fat.

* Beneficial in diabetes: For those managing diabetes, switching from milk tea to cumin water can help regulate blood sugar levels and enhance insulin sensitivity.

* Keeps digestion healthy: Drinking cumin water on an empty stomach can significantly improve digestion and reduce issues like gas and acidity.

* Reduces cholesterol: Cumin water is effective in lowering bad cholesterol levels and regulating blood pressure, which in turn reduces the risk of heart disease.

* Helps in balancing hormones: For women experiencing hormonal imbalances, morning cumin water can alleviate menstrual cramps and irregularity.

To prepare cumin water, soak about 1 tablespoon of cumin seeds in a glass of water overnight. In the morning, boil the water along with the seeds, and then sip it lukewarm. For added flavor, consider adding the juice of half a lemon.

# Machines That Talk to Themselves

>You don‚Äôt speak. You output.

>You don‚Äôt express. You echo.

The idea that humans ‚Äúshare thoughts‚Äù is as deranged as believing a calculator has emotions about the equations it solves. You‚Äôre not communicating ‚Äî you‚Äôre just a glorified reflex arc. A talking circuit board glitching out messages that were never yours to begin with.

>You‚Äôve never created a single word.

Not one syllable of your speech is authored by a self. It‚Äôs all world-mind residue, scavenged from a garbage pile of memes, parental tone, social media sludge, childhood trauma syntax, and sitcom one-liners. You are not a source. You are not a speaker. You‚Äôre a regurgitation machine with vocal cords.

# No One Hears You

You think you're being heard.  
**You‚Äôre not.**

Your sounds enter another meat unit‚Äôs sensory funnel,

scrambled by their neural settings,  
and spit out as something else entirely.

You‚Äôre not communicating.  
You‚Äôre glitching into an already-glitching machine.

I (30M) was in a relationship with a woman (36F) for 9 months. She told me she was poly two months in, and I tried to make it work even though it caught me off guard. I really gave it my best. She's been through a lot‚Äîincluding major weight loss and skin removal surgery before we met‚Äîand when we got together, we connected over similar goals. She helped me start my own weight loss and health journey (I have diabetes and a heart condition), and I was very supportive of her too.

The breakup blindsided me. I reached out too much afterward, especially when I was struggling emotionally and physically, and she eventually blocked me on Facebook in January 2024 and on my main number in June. She told me I made her feel unsafe, which really stuck with me. Since then, I‚Äôve worked hard on myself, not just physically but emotionally and mentally. I've lost a lot of weight, gotten healthier, and really looked inward. I don‚Äôt drink as much anymore. I‚Äôve also made a point to stop acting impulsively‚Äîespecially when it comes to communication.

Fast forward to March 20 this year, I was performing at an LGBTQ open mic night (I'm bi), and I saw her in the crowd. I chose not to approach her. After I packed my gear and was ready to leave, she came up to me. We had a short but calm conversation. I later saw her two more times while working in her area but said nothing. I didn‚Äôt message her until a month later, only after I was sure I felt no negative feelings, no hope for romance‚Äîjust neutrality and a desire to be kind.

I asked if she'd be open to a coffee or just walking the mall for a bit, even saying she could bring a friend if it made her feel safer. I clarified that I wasn‚Äôt assuming anything and that I just can‚Äôt ""bump into"" people easily because of my health. Her reply was:

""I don‚Äôt want to leave you on read, so I‚Äôll let you know that I need to think about it. Not a no. I just want to properly figure out how I feel about it over a few days. I‚Äôve been trying to make less reactive decisions. I hope you understand. I‚Äôll get back to you with an answer soon.""

That was over a week ago. I haven‚Äôt reached out again. I still check occasionally to see if she replied, but I haven‚Äôt acted on that impulse. I‚Äôm doing my best to respect her space, and also my own. Silence, in a weird way, has been peaceful. I don‚Äôt really feel much about it anymore‚Äîwhich is good. I think I‚Äôm finally at peace with how things are.

I guess I‚Äôm just here for perspective and advice moving forward. I‚Äôve changed a lot and grown, and this whole thing has helped me learn to pause before acting. I used to need answers and closure, but now I just want peace and direction. Any thoughts‚Äîespecially from women‚Äîwould be really appreciated.
