A well-fitted flannel that’s soft from years of washes, its cuffs rolled just so to show a wristwatch with a scratched face (a gift from your dad). A pair of chinos in that shade of navy that goes with everything, but you’ve hemmed them yourself because “perfect length” matters more than the tag. A jacket that’s seen rainstorms and coffee runs, its pockets holding a pen, a lint roller, and a mint—because looking put-together and being prepared? That’s the combo. At r/FriendlyStylishGuyA, we believe fashion should hug you as tightly as your favorite hoodie: comfortable, confident, and unapologetically *you*.This is where “stylish” doesn’t mean “stiff.” Share your “effortless elevate” moments: “I wear a lot of plain tees, so I started tucking just the front into my jeans—suddenly, it’s not ‘lazy’ anymore. Add a leather bracelet my sister made, and I went from ‘grocery run’ to ‘let’s grab coffee’ ready in 10 seconds. No fancy stuff, just a tweak that makes me feel good.” Celebrate “wardrobe workhorses with personality”: “That gray blazer? I’ve had it since college. It’s got a tiny stain on the elbow (thanks, ketchup incident of 2020), but I love it. Wear it over a band tee and jeans to a concert, or with a button-down to a job interview—same jacket, totally different energy. It’s like a chameleon, but friendlier.”Gush over “small details that shout ‘hello’”: “I swap out my shoelaces. Basic black sneakers? Throw on red laces, and suddenly they’re smiling. Brown boots? Cream laces make them feel cozier, like they want to high-five your socks. People notice—‘Nice shoes!’—and it starts a conversation. Who knew strings could be social icebreakers?” Swap “kindness in the closet” hacks: “I keep a spare scarf in my jacket pocket. Last week, a guy at the bus stop was shivering, so I lent it to him. He returned it the next day with a coffee. Turns out, looking good and doing good? They go together like a well-matched pair of socks.”This isn’t about keeping up with trends. It’s about keeping up with *you*. The guy who wears a vintage band shirt because the music shaped him, not because a magazine said so. The one who irons his shirts but leaves the sleeves a little rumpled—“too perfect feels like lying.” Here, “Can I pull off pastels?” gets a “Absolutely. Try a light blue henley with dark jeans. It’s soft, not loud, and it makes your smile look brighter. Trust me.” “Is this outfit ‘too casual’?” sparks “Casual doesn’t mean careless. A clean shirt, pants that fit, and shoes that aren’t caked in mud? That’s respect—for yourself and the people around you. And respect looks good on everyone.”So bring your “I thrifted this and it’s my new favorite” finds, your “how to dress for a date *and* a hike” dilemmas, and your “style is just being nice to yourself” philosophies. r/FriendlyStylishGuyA is where we prove that great style isn’t about having a closet full of clothes—it’s about having a closet full of *you*.

She's got long, fine hair, the kind that doesn't really come out for anything but her own tongue.  I have always combed her a few times a week, but I switched to night shift at work in april and cut back on the brushing while I adjusted.  A couple of days ago I discovered a matt about the size of the bottom of a coffee mug on her belly, right behind her front legs.  My girl hates me messing with her stomach, but she hates strangers even more.  Aside from when I take her to the vet's office and give her no choice, I'm the only person allowed to touch her.

Should I keep slowly working at the spots with my comb and some cornstarch or just bite the bullet and take her to the groomer?  She doesn't seem to be in any pain and she doesn't fight me when I flip her over, but I have about sixty seconds to work on it before the struggles begin.  I have some clippers I used to use to trim the fur out of my dog's paw pads and my horse's bridle path, etc, but I'm not confident in my own abilities to use them on such a small area.

Three years of marriage, and all I got was his betrayal.

He fell for my student.

To win her over, he humiliated me again and again.

But to her, he was gentle, caring, and full of affection.

I used to think a wealthy heir like him truly loved me deeply.

But his love only lasted three years.

But he started hurting himself like crazy, begging me to forgive him.

\#####Chapter 1

 

One of Celeste Adams’s students hadn’t turned in a single assignment all semester. So she docked her participation grade.That afternoon, her desk was refused by a group of people.

 

 

 

Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she’d stayed up grading.

 

Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.

 

She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke—but just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.

 

Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. “Don’t cry. I’ve already settled the socre for you. As long as I’m around, no one’s going to lay a finger on you.”

 

Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. “Thank you, Mr. Sullivan… If it weren’t for you, I’d be eaten alive at school. I don’t even know how to repay you.”

 

Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. “Then repay me with a kiss. Deal?”

 

Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.

 

“This is just a thank-you… It doesn’t mean I’m saying yes to you.” She whispered. “You’re married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.”

 

Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. “Okay. I’ll wait.”

 

Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.

 

...

 

She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, “Celeste, I’ll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.”

 

And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of “forever”?

 

Once Vanessa was gone—back to her dorm—Celeste finally walked up to Lucian’s car, her face pale.

 

Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.

 

When he saw her, he clearly froze. “Celeste?”

 

“Lucian Sullivan.” Her voice shook. “You and her… how long has this been going on?”

 

Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a puff ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes—eyes designed to break tickers.

 

“Well, since you’ve found out, I won’t bother hiding it.” His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. “You only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime—the party's over.""

 

“I do love you, Celeste. But don’t expect me to love only you. That gets boring.”

 

“Vanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I’m intrigued. Don’t worry, I’m not planning to divorce you. When I’m done having fun, I’ll come back to you.”

 

Celeste felt her ticker twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. “I can’t accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.”

 

A frown snapped onto Lucian’s face, his voice turning icy. “Stop overreacting. I’ve made myself clear. I’ll spend most of the rest of my life with you—as long as you…”

 

He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. “Behave. And stop bothering my girl.”

 

With that, he let go and walked away.

 

Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.

 

She’d heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy—men playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.

 

But she’d never thought Lucian would become one of them.

 

Because he had once loved her so deeply.

 

So deeply he’d insisted on marrying her—a nobody teacher’s daughter—even against the Sullivan family’s objections. So deeply he’d stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days…

 

On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.

 

Turns out, “the rest of his life” ended way sooner than she expected.

 

Celeste didn’t even remember how she got home.

 

She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.

 

When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her thorax.

 

Her eyes flew open—she was suspended inside a massive glass tank, and the water level was steadily rising.

 

Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.

 

The firelight danced on his handsome profile—but none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.

 

“Lucian…!” she struggled, water splashing everywhere. “What are you doing?!”

 

“You went to Vanessa,” he said coldly. “Told her to stay away from me.”

 

The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. “So she deleted all my contacts.”

 

“This is your punishment. Remember this lesson.”

 

“I didn’t!” Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. “I never even saw her after I went home!”

 

“Still lying?” Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. “Increase the water.”

 

The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.

 

Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.

 

Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. “I told you—I love you. Just give me ten years, and I’ll come back.”

 

“But first, stop going after Vanessa.”

 

And with that, he turned and left.

 

“Lucian! Lucian—!”

 

Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.

 

The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.

 

On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes—

 

That school trip years ago, when she’d fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.

 

The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.

 

The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached…

 

But now, it had all gone up in puff.

 

By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn’t even stand.

 

She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.

 

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up—

 

Vanessa had updated her social feed.

 

“First time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~”

 

The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.

 

Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed—while tears fell onto the screen.

 

She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.

 

Lucian didn’t return until that night.

 

Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. “Let’s grab dinner. I’ll make it up to you, okay?”

 

He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. “It’s over now. I’m just gonna be with her for ten years. Don’t go looking for trouble again.”

 

Celeste looked up, calm. “Fine. But you need to sign something.”

 

She handed him a document. “A contract promising you’ll come back to the family after ten years.”

 

Lucian didn’t even glance at it before signing.

 

“Happy now?” He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.

 

Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. “Yeah. I’m happy.”

 

She was happy.

 

Because he hadn’t realized—what he signed wasn’t a promise to return.

 

It was a divorce agreement...

 

\#####Chapter 2

 

Just as Lucian Sullivan finished signing his name, his phone rang.

 

His assistant, Connor’s voice came through the phone speaker. “Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Clarke twisted her ankle. She’s in a lot of pain and can’t walk…”

 

Lucian’s expression shifted slightly. “I’ll be right there.”

 

He put the phone away and looked at Celeste. “Vanessa got hurt. I need to go check on her. Rain check on dinner.”

 

“Don’t bother.” Celeste clenched the divorce papers in her hand. “I don’t need you to keep me company anymore.”

 

Lucian frowned like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned and left.

 

Celeste headed straight to a law office. The attorney flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. “It’s valid. The divorce will be finalized after the mandatory 30-day waiting period..”

 

“Thank you.”

 

Leaving the firm, Celeste went back to Ashbourne University. In the Dean’s office, she handed in her resignation letter.

 

“Celeste?” Dean Walker looked up in surprise. “You’re one of our best instructors. Why are you suddenly quitting?”

 

“I’m getting divorced,” Celeste replied calmly. “I want to leave this city.”

 

Dean Walker sighed. “Alright… finish the last few classes this semester, then you can go.”

 

“Thank you.”

 

Celeste stepped out of the office and took a deep breath.

 

For her final class, she pulled herself together and walked into the lecture hall—only to spot Lucian and Vanessa sitting in the back corner.

 

Lucian, dressed in a crisp suit, lounged in the last row. Vanessa leaned against his shoulder. The two of them whispered and giggled, fingers entwined.

 

Celeste felt a sharp pain in her thorax.

 

Lucian used to be a complete workaholic—he had cut their honeymoon short after just three days to rush back to the office. And now, he was skipping billion-dollar deals just to sit in on a random elective class with Vanessa?

 

She took another breath, walked to the front of the class, and began. “Today we’re reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets…”

 

Throughout the entire lecture, laughter kept floating from the back row.

 

Lucian’s low chuckles. Vanessa’s coquettish replies. Each sound stabbed Celeste like a knife.

 

The second the class ended, she practically bolted out of the classroom.

 

In the restroom, she splashed cold water on her face. She was just about to leave when she heard Vanessa’s voice coming from one of the stalls.

 

“Lucian gave up a billion-dollar contract just to chase after me—and even sat through class with me!” she bragged on the phone. “You should’ve seen the way he was looking at me—like he wanted to devour me.”

 

A girl on the other end asked, “If he likes you that much, why haven’t you said yes yet?”

 

“Are you dumb?” Vanessa scoffed. “Guys like him? They’re surrounded by women. The only way to keep them hooked is to string them along—hot and cold.”

 

She lowered her voice. “I’m not looking to be some kept woman. I want to be Mrs. Sullivan.”

 

Celeste stood rooted in place, nails digging into her palm.

 

Expressionless, she walked out of the restroom and passed right by Vanessa.

 

“Professor Adams!” Vanessa scrambled to hang up and rushed after her, grabbing her arm. “What did you hear?”

 

“Nothing.” Celeste scumbaged her hand away. “Whatever it is, it’s none of my business.”

 

Vanessa still wanted to follow up, but out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lucian approaching.

 

Her eyes flickered, and without warning, she grabbed Celeste’s wrist and slapped herself—hard.

 

Smack!

 

The sharp crack of a slap echoed harshly down the hallway.

 

“Professor…” Vanessa covered her face, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice trembling with grievance. “I swear I’ll stay far away from Mr. Sullivan from now on… Please don’t be mad at me…”

 

Lucian stormed over, his face thunderous. “Celeste! You signed the darn agreement! Why are you still bullying Vanessa?!”

 

“I didn’t.” Celeste looked at him calmly. “She slapped herself.”

 

“Mr. Sullivan…” Vanessa whimpered, shrinking into his arms. “Maybe… maybe you should stop pursuing me. Professor Adams is so angry. I’m scared…”

 

Lucian immediately pulled her into his arms. “Don’t be. She doesn’t get to decide what I do.”

 

Vanessa’s eyes were red and watery as she whispered, “But she’s still your wife. She forced me to stay away from you… and she slapped me…”

 

Her voice broke, “I’ve never been treated like this before…”

 

Lucian’s eyes darkened. He gently touched her cheek where it had turned red, his voice soft.

“Don’t be upset. I'll let you get back at her tenfold, okay?”

 

\#####Chapter 3

 

Vanessa feigned panic. “I… I really shouldn’t. She’s your wife. And she’s my professor… How could I ever hit my teacher?”

 

“Then let the bodyguards do it.” Lucian’s voice remained gentle—while saying the cruelest words. “That way you won’t have to get your hands dirty.”

 

Celeste’s pupils contracted, staring in disbelief at the man who once shielded her from the world. “Lucian… do you even hear yourself right now?”

 

Lucian didn’t even spare her a glance. He raised his hand and gave the order. “Do it.”

 

Two towering bodyguards stepped forward and slammed her against the wall, pinning her in place.

 

Smack!

 

The first slap exploded against her cheek. A sharp ringing filled Celeste’s ears.

 

In a daze, she saw a memory from years ago—a stormy night when Lucian had once stood in front of her like a shield, growling, “Touch her and I’ll make you wish you were dead.”

 

Smack!

 

The second slap shattered the memory. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, staining her pale lips red.

 

Through the haze, she saw Lucian gently covering Vanessa’s eyes, whispering softly in her ear.

Vanessa let out a playful little squeal and lightly punched his thorax.

 

…

 

By the tenth slap, Celeste could no longer feel the pain. Her body gave out, collapsing to the ground as stifled gasps of horror rippled through the students nearby.

 

Through blurry vision, she saw Lucian say gently to Vanessa, “Come on, let’s go get sushi at that place you love.”

 

Students in the hallway whispered behind cupped hands, “God… poor Professor Adams…”

 

“How could Mr. Sullivan do that to her?”

 

“That girl is disgusting. She slapped herself!”

 

Celeste propped herself up against the wall and slowly stood.

 

Her face throbbed, each step like a blade slicing into her skin.

 

But what was this pain compared to the gaping wound in her ticker—raw, bleeding, torn open like someone had clawed through it.

 

She had thought… even if Lucian no longer loved her, he’d at least show some shred of compassion for the past they shared.

 

But he actually had her slapped ten times in front of the crowd, all for Vanessa.

 

As she stepped out the school gates, the autumn wind stung her bruised face. She gasped in pain.

 

Back at home, she stood before the mirror and stared at her wretched reflection. 

And suddenly—she laughed.

 

Laughed until fat tears spilled down her cheeks.

 

It took her three days to heal the wounds on her face before she could go back to school like nothing had happened.

 

As soon as she stepped into her office, her phone rang. Dean Walker’s voice came through.

“Celeste, Vanessa Clarke skipped several midterm exams. As her academic advisor, you need to follow up with her.”

 

Celeste opened Vanessa’s social feed.

 

The latest post showed her at an auction, a priceless diamond necklace draped around her neck, with the caption: Mr. Sullivan said this necklace suits me perfectly\~

 

Scrolling further, it was all pictures of her and Lucian out at lavish venues: private yachts, Michelin-starred restaurants, equestrian clubs…

 

Celeste dialed Vanessa’s number.

 

The background music was loud. Vanessa’s cheerful voice answered, “Hello? Professor?”

 

“You missed your midterm exams,” Celeste said matter-of-factly. “Dean Walker asked me to check in with you..”

 

“Oh, that,” Vanessa giggled. “It’s just a few exams. You’re close with the Dean—can’t you just enter some grades for me?”

 

She paused, then added smugly, “If that’s too much trouble, I’ll have Mr. Sullivan donate a few buildings. Problem solved, right?”

 

Lucian’s low laughter echoed from the background. “Having fun?”

 

“Mm-hmm\~” Vanessa cooed back. Then she added to Celeste, “Professor, if it’s nothing urgent, don’t call again. We’re busy enjoying ourselves.”

 

Click. The call ended.

 

Celeste gave a bitter laugh and set her phone down. She didn’t bother following up.

 

That evening, as she headed home, she spotted Lucian in the front yard of the mansion, personally teaching Vanessa how to drive.

 

“Relax your grip on the wheel. Don’t be nervous.” He stood beside the driver's seat, leaning down close to Vanessa, his voice impossibly soft. “Don’t be afraid. I’m right here.”

 

The scene pierced through Celeste like a blade.

 

Once, he had taught her to drive exactly like this.

 

When she fumbled and nearly hit a guardrail, he had only laughed and pinched her cheek. “What’s there to be afraid of? I’m right here.”

 

Now he was saying the exact same words to another girl.

 

“Try it on your own,” Lucian said, stepping back.

 

Vanessa bit her lip. “I—I’m scared I’ll hit someone…”

 

“It’s okay,” Lucian said, gently ruffling her hair. “I’m here.”

 

Reassured, Vanessa pressed the accelerator.

 

And then—she suddenly swerved straight at Celeste.

 

BAM!

 

Celeste was thrown into the air and slammed to the ground.

 

Blood spread beneath her, soaking the pavement.

 

Through the pain, she saw Lucian rushing toward her.

 

But the first thing he did was pull the panicked Vanessa into his arms. “Are you okay? Did it scare you?”

 

Celeste lay in a pool of blood, her vision darkening.

 

…

 

When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed.

 

“You’re awake?” Lucian stood at her bedside, face calm. “The doctor said you’ve fractured a few ribs. Don’t go back to work. Just rest.”

 

Celeste opened her mouth, but the pain in her thorax silenced her. She could only glare at him with bloodshot eyes.

 

“Vanessa didn’t mean to hit you,” Lucian continued. “She just started learning. She panicked.”

 

“She… did it... on purpose…” Through the pain, Celeste forced each word between through gritted teeth. “I was nowhere near her…”

 

Lucian’s brows knit together, his tone turning impatient. “Celeste, what exactly do you want?”",1,1752732991.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I tried really hard to land a summer internship this year by networking, applying, and reaching out, but nothing worked out. Instead, I went back to school for two months to catch up on some courses, and ever since, I’ve been feeling pretty down, especially when I see my peers posting about their internships offer or firms announcing their summer analyst classes.

Now I have about a month and a half before school starts again, and honestly, everything just feels stuck. Most days, I wake up and get straight into job-related tasks: I send out LinkedIn invites to alumni and professionals, write tailored cold emails, and apply to fall internships. Every now and then, I get a coffee chat from my cold outreach, approximately once every two weeks, and I do my best to prepare for those.

Acting is a passion of mine, so I apply to casting calls, reach out to people, and check Facebook groups and casting sites, but most of the time I either get rejected or hear nothing back. When I’m not doing that, I apply to scholarships, conferences, and jobs, and I go for walks or bike rides to get some fresh air. I used to go to the gym, but I’ve lost interest because it no longer feels fun.

I’m ready to work, I’m ready to contribute, and ready to play, but I’m not getting any opportunities. It’s hard not to compare myself to others because I’m 21 and this is supposed to be the prime years of my life, yet instead I keep failing. 

All my friends  are traveling, in relationships, landing great jobs, and having fun, while I feel stuck. Same thing on social media all my female classmate are just living life while I’m applying for so many internship for the fall term. 

I have about $5,000. I have thought about using some of it to travel and reset, but I’m nervous I’ll need it for school expenses. I also think it not right to used the money as I failed to get an internship and I feel like a piece of shit for going 4 months without work. Since I can’t get an interview for shit in this competitive market. 

Right now, I just feel lost. I’ve been keeping up this routine for the past three weeks, and it’s exhausting without showing any progress. I don’t know what to do for the next one and a half months before school starts or hopefully a Co-op placement (since I failed twice in getting a work op placement)

Here are some non-negotiable boundaries that I have for first dates. I would like an honest opinion to know if I am reasonable. 

1. I must chat with you on the phone first (preferably FaceTime, but a phone call is ok) before we meet in person. We don't necessarily have to exchange phone numbers; we can call on any platform. This is for me to get a quick vibe check to rule out people who I do not have a good connection with right off the bat.

2. I do not do dinner on the first date. I prefer something simple like coffee, walking around the park, or a drink at a bar. This is because in the case I know that this is not a match, I do not want to be stuck for 1-2 hours at dinner with someone I do not like or he does not like me. 

3. I will not let my date pick me up, I will always drive myself. Not only because I will not share my address with a stranger, but also because if I felt unsafe and wanted to leave, I'm not stuck with someone because I need a ride home. If my date does not have a ride, I will happily offer to pick them up.

4. Nobody owes me anything, and I do not owe anyone anything. If we meet and I feel catfished (different person, heavy filters, very old pictures where you look obviously different), I interpret that as you lying about who you really are, so I will politely apologize and say that I will be going back home. 

5. If I feel like this is not a match, I will end the date at the 30 minute mark. I will not be wasting my time and my date's time by stretching the date if I know that I do not want to see this person again. 

These boundaries are for people that I meet on dating apps. Not all of them apply for people that I meet in real life. ",1,1752732442.0,askgaybros,2,1.0,False

Spent a couple nights with her back in 2020, the whole time she was dominant, everything I could’ve asked for, beautiful, impressive abs, muscular to where she’s fit but clearly wasn’t juicing like an IBF bodybuilder, just a casual looking woman who looks like she can do 10+ pull ups with weights, 

It was both of our first time, the night I met up with her we did things to make sure we were comfortable, next morning I bought her breakfast, and coffee, then lunch, unimportant stuff, then we went to a sex shop it was super awkward for me and quite embarrassing actually, but she had me pick out the one I was comfortable with and of course I paid for it and some cuffs to try out, 

The first time she pegged me that night she really enjoyed it, I could tell she loved it, and was very very satisfied, happy, pleased afterwards, she also took pics and videos and I still have a couple of them to this day, 

But it was when she did it the next morning that had me hooked, she woke me up to it, full on surprised I had no idea she was planning on doing it, but I felt her lube me up and slide in and I miss that feeling more than anything, i could tell she was in love with this as much as I was, after awhile she let me lick the position, she didn’t like e one I picked where im on my back on the edge of the bed, but she slid in me anyways, her facial expression, her muscles tensing up, how hard she was my pounding me, of course I was as stiff as a statue, she told me to jerk myself off so I did, and she started fucking me even harder, I felt the biggest most intense buildup I’ve ever felt it took over my entire body, I didn’t care about my facial expressions or noises, she started fucking me even harder and faster and then I came, my legs were shaking I had zero control over them, she wouldn’t stop pounding me until I stopped shaking, 

I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at her I felt in love like I’d do anything for this woman, she wishes we had done it again before I left that day, and again when we both had alone time a few months after, 

But after that experience, I’d randomly buy her breakfast, lunch, dinner, give her gas money, if she was out with her friends she knew she could text me to send her money for drinks and of course I would always make sure I sent enough, at some pints I did feel bad but at the same time she still had a lot of control over me, I still reminisce that feeling and time with her, I would still send she money honestly but I knew it got to a point to where I had to stop it, even if I didn’t want too, 

I’ve tried sending with other women but it just didn’t feel the same after her,I also have never been dominated since her either, although there have been opportunities she set a really really really high bar that I’ve only met one person (this my friend) that comes close to that bar she has set, and somehow me turning into her paying has helped me not enjoy being a paying for just any woman, 

She genuinrly has to be a woman who genuinely just wants to dominant and that to me is a fair exchange but sadly I have yet to find another woman like this, one who is naturally dominant for the love of it but me being her paying is just a plus and honestly I don’t think I want to find another woman like her, just a normal healthy dynamic D/s dynamic,

Apologies in advance if I ruffle any connoisseur feathers, but I genuinely struggle to pick up all those fancy tasting notes often described on coffee bags.

I’ve experimented with different brewing methods—pour-over, Chemex, espresso, moka pot—but only a few coffees have stood out in terms of distinct flavors. Interestingly, light to medium roasts brewed as pour-overs seem to bring out the most noticeable and enjoyable notes for me.

As for espresso, bitterness aside, most taste quite similar to my palate, often with malty, earthy tones and a slightly sweet aftertaste. That said, when espresso is paired with milk, the individual flavor differences become a lot more pronounced and enjoyable.

Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there’s a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I’m mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I’m just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn’t too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn’t much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn’t the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy’s face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family’s home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle’s bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they’d seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn’t have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn’t explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn’t much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn’t supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn’t meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I’ve never been the same since.",1,1752732092.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Good news for coffee lovers! Your morning black coffee isn’t just allowed during fasting windows—it can actually *enhance* your results. 



✅ Zero Calories – Pure black coffee (no sugar, milk, or cream) won’t break your fast, keeping you in fat-burning mode.

✅ Boosts Energy & Focus – The caffeine kick helps combat fasting fatigue and keeps you sharp.

✅ Appetite Suppressant – Coffee can help curb hunger pangs, making your fasting window easier to manage.

✅ May Enhance Fat Burning – Studies suggest caffeine can increase metabolism and support ketosis.



⚠️ But Watch Out!

* Too much can cause jitters or disrupt sleep (stick to 1-3 cups max).
* Avoid additives—even a splash of cream can spike insulin for some.



🔥 Pro Tip: Try a pinch of cinnamon or salt to reduce bitterness without breaking your fast!

i am a 1st year psychology student who loves doing digital art. i've been doing art commissions for the past six months supposedly to save up for college since ayan naman talaga goal ko. my friends were doing the same thing, and we shared the same struggles and celebrated each other's wins every time isa samin nagkakaclient. over the past few months, i got a lot of commissions from international clients and actually managed to save up—i even had a few returning clients which was really unexpected on my end. i almost hit my first ever five digits pa nga, kaya lang i have this really bad habit of impulse buying kasi ngayon ko lang talaga naspospoil sarili ko. minsan pangload lang for myself para hindi na mamoblema tatay ko.

last week, tinry kong magcashout ng ₱300 at our canteen since gcash lang ang hawak ko sa ngayon, kabado bente pa nga si bakla kasi nagtanong-tanong pako. and i SWEAR i've never felt so happy holding money that i earned. i immediately bought stuff i’ve always wanted to try, mostly food i’ve been eyeing for a while like the mini corndogs na tig-₱5 lang, 'yung coffee jelly nila, tas 'yung sundae pa nila. marami. marami parin akong gustong matikman na pagkain sa campus namin. foodie yorn?

nakokonsensya ako sa pamasahe na binibigay sakin ng tatay ko, kahit may sumobra pa sa barya, mapasakin man 'yan at ipapambili ko lang ng candy naguguilty ako. i have been trying to control myself for the past few weeks kaso naalala ko may pera pa pala akong naipon para sa sarili ko, bakit hindi nalang 'yan 'yung ipanggastos ko for food and other necessities na need ko inside or outside the school? nakita ko kasi kaklase ko nagpacashout nung nakaraan kasi need nya bumili ng dept. shirt, i was like ""hmm, try ko nga rin?""

I know for all us it did but in a matter of 3 months I went from making nearly 20k a month to 4k, having a break up, and moving home with my parents, both who had cancer.

I went from being the guy who was arrogant because he owned multiple properties to the guy who was negative cash flow of at least $4,000 a month and having multiple tenants say ""I know my rights"".

I lost the vast majority of my social circle and found myself running to hospitals, doctors appointments, felt isolated, and nearly lost my mind.

The only 2 people who really believed in me were my parents. I got orange pilled through twitter. I thought I would be rich in 2021. My portfolio went down 75%. I doubled down at 20k during FTX.

I hung out at coffee shop where the owner was very kind to me. He never judged me for my bitcoin insanity. In fact, he actually bought some. 

My parents believed in me. they even bought bitcoin. But they bought it for me-they were in their 70s. they didn't need the $, and any moeny they wanted the kids to have. It was their way of saying we are with you.

In 2022 my dad died. The loss feels like you have your legs cut out from under you. Later on, the owner of the coffee shop said ""your dad said Joe has to have huge balls to do what he is doing"" (Joe is not my real name). That was really cool of my dad.

There were a few times where my parents helped me pay my mortgage. But it's not the financial support. It was the emotional support. I was being battered by life, and they were going through cancer.

I have to say when I talk to a lot of my old friends and compare them to my parents, I'm appalled at how really weak people are. Today modern people  are massive complainers, and honestly have no stamina. Weak ass people.

Yes, today, and even though I have chosen to sell a few btc along the way (and of course regret it) when I need cash, I feel vindicated. And I have my parents to thank.

I was laughed at, made fun of, told to shut up, and mocked by many people I used to consider friends. I feel like I made the right choice to but btc and also redo my social circle.

But-i couldn't have done it without my dad and mom. I simply could not.

It was fucking brutal.

But, we all need to walk through the fires of hell.

Not just surface-level friends, but the kind that talk every day, who share little updates and bad jokes, who know how the other person takes their coffee and how they cope with bad dreams. She wants to be best friends first because then, falling in love wouldn’t be hard at all.

But that’s when the stakes get higher. Because then it’s not just a matter of losing the love of her life, it’s the fear of losing her best friend too. And somehow, that part hurts more.

Let’s say they don’t break up.Let’s imagine they actually make it.( I really hope they do)

Still, she’s the kind of person who struggles to open up, even when she knows the other person is safe. She carries things quietly. She aches in silence. People around her have no idea what she's going through.

There are thoughts she can't share like what she’s afraid of, what keeps her up at night, the parts of herself that feel too heavy or too much. And while maybe it’s not necessary to share everything in a relationship... to her, it is.

Because she wants someone who gives her all of himself — the highs, the lows, the joy, the despair. She wants to be there. Maybe not always at his highs, but always at his lows. To sit beside him when the world gets loud. To remind him he’s not alone.

She realises that someone people needs space but wants to be his space. His safe space. Someone with whom he never has to pretend.

But the thing is... she doesn't think she can give the same in return. Not because she doesn’t want to, but because something in her freezes when it's her turn to speak.

She wants all of him. But she’s not sure she can give all of herself. And if she can’t do that... Then it wouldn’t be fair, would it?

1m1zmtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m1zmtq/chapter_17_we_meet_again/,Chapter 17- We meet again,"The humid Los Angeles air, thick with the scent of opportunity and exhaust fumes, enveloped Ela, Tanya, and Mitch as they stepped off the train at Union Station. The grand, Spanish-colonial architecture of the terminal loomed above them, a stark contrast to the familiar red brick of Stoke-On-Trent. Ela gaped, her head thrown back, taking it all in.

“Alright, ladies, big moment,” Mitch announced, grinning, pulling his backpack higher on his shoulder. “I want to introduce you to one of my best mates, Alex. He’s great, you’re gonna love him.”

Ela exchanged a quick glance with Tanya. “We met an Alex already,” she said, a hint of amusement in her voice. “I guess we’re meeting another Alex.”

Mitch paused, a slight frown creasing his brow. “Oh, really? Where’s this Alex live?”

“Woodland Hills,” Tanya supplied, already heading towards the Metro Red Line entrance.

Mitch’s eyes widened. “No way! What a coincidence, *this* Alex also lives in Woodland Hills.” He chuckled, shaking his head. “Small world, huh?”

They descended into the coolness of the Metro station. Ela’s eyes, accustomed to the quaint English countryside, were wide with fascination. The hum of the invisible trains, the rush of air, the diverse faces around them – it was all so vibrant. “We have nothing cool like this in Stoke-On-Trent,” she exclaimed, her voice echoing slightly in the tunnel. “All we have is the lame bus that goes 20 kmph at most.”

Tanya nodded in fervent agreement. “Exactly! LA is way more exciting than Newcastle-Upon-Lyme. The buses there are practically horse-drawn carriages compared to this.”

A distant rumble grew louder, and then the sleek, silver train glided into the station. The doors hissed open, and everyone piled on. As the train began to move, a soft, melodic chime sounded, announcing the next station. Ela leaned against the window, watching the blur of the tunnel walls. In that moment, she truly loved LA. The sheer scale and energy of it were intoxicating.

“You see,” Mitch said, turning to them, “Dallas has nothing exciting like this. It’s just a boring yellow light rail there that is lame.”

They rode the train, the subterranean journey feeling like an adventure. When the train plunged deep through the mountains, the sensation of being so far underground, yet moving so fast, was exhilarating. Ela found herself imagining a life here, waking up to sunshine, hopping on this very train. Tanya, beside her, seemed lost in similar thoughts, a wistful smile playing on her lips.

They eventually pulled into North Hollywood Station. After disembarking, Mitch gestured towards a line of long, articulated buses. “Alright, next up, the Orange Line Bus.”

Tanya squinted. “This is a bus?”

“Yes, it has its dedicated road, so it’s like a train but on wheels,” Mitch explained patiently as they joined the queue. Ela was once again fascinated, watching the bus pull away on what indeed looked like its own set of tracks, weaving through the urban landscape.

They boarded the bus, found seats, and continued their journey. The dedicated busway felt surprisingly smooth, like a private highway for public transport. They rode for a few more stops, getting off at Sherman Way Station.

And there he was. A tall guy with a friendly smile, waiting just outside the station exit.

“Alex!” Mitch called out, waving.

Ela felt a jolt. This wasn't *another* Alex. This was *the* Alex. She turned to Mitch, her eyes wide. “Mitch,” she began, a grin spreading across her face, “this is the same Alex me and Tanya met.”

Mitch’s jaw dropped. He looked from Ela to Alex, then back again, his mouth slightly agape. “Wow,” he finally managed, shaking his head in disbelief. “What a small world.”

Alex, too, looked utterly shocked. His smile morphed into an incredulous stare. “Ela and Tanya? No way! I never thought I would see both of you again!”

Mitch, still reeling from the coincidence, added, “We met on the metrolink earlier.”

Alex nodded, still dazed. “Anyway, since you’re here, want to chill at my house? We can catch up properly.”

“Yes!” everyone chorused, the excitement of the unexpected reunion bubbling up. They all piled into Alex’s car, Mitch squeezing into the backseat with the girls, and headed for his house.

At Alex’s house, nestled amidst lush greenery, the initial awkwardness of the unexpected reunion quickly dissolved into easy conversation. The backyard was a haven, and soon, discussions flowed freely.

“You know, I saw this crazy thing on the news,” Alex began, sipping from a glass of iced tea. “Remember that Billy the Bumble Bee book? Apparently, Billy has some friends that could use tips on how to manage their anger. They’re calling them ‘buzzing bullies’ and the book’s showing them how to stop stinging.” He chuckled. “Speaking of which, that bumblebee out there,” he pointed to a large, industrious bee still diligently working on a vibrant sunflower plant near the fence, “he has been on it since yesterday, through all the rain, and he is still going at it, dude.”

Tanya nodded. “It’s like they have their own little ecosystem of drama.”

Mitch then piped up, “Oh, you know what else I remembered? When Westfield Topanga first opened after the remodel in 2006, they had some good quick-service options, like Häagen-Dazs and Coral Tree Cafe. I miss that. Now it’s all… upscale.”

“Yeah, well, speaking of official things,” Ela added, remembering something she’d seen online, “the California Department of Toxic Substances Control is proactively seeking public input through a new annual community survey. They want to hear from people about environmental concerns.”

“And get this,” Alex interjected, his eyes gleaming. “Upscale furniture store Arhaus will open its new location at the former Sears building in Canoga Park. Total transformation, right?”

The conversation then drifted, as conversations often do. Mitch leaned forward, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Guess what, Alex? These two, Ela and Tanya, were actually talking about visiting DFW.”

Alex considered this, a thoughtful expression on his face. “You know, I’m not opposed to it. In fact, I’ve been to DFW. I actually liked it. The people there were really warm and kind.”

Mitch dramatically shook his head, looking disgusted. “Ugh, no,” he declared, pushing away an imaginary plate. “I hated that place. Seriously, don’t do it. It’s boring, and the traffic is terrible.”

Ela, however, had spent the day absorbing the LA vibe. “You know what?” she mused, looking out at the abundant greenery. “I think I might just want to stay in LA. I love California already.”

Alex’s face lit up. He turned to her, a genuine smile spreading across his face. “California *is* wonderful. I will never leave.”

Mitch nodded emphatically. “Me neither. Committed to staying forever. This place just has everything.” He then grimaced. “It’s nothing like DFW. You heard about Andy? He lives there, and he hates it.”

Ela raised an eyebrow. “Andy? You mean… Andy from Alex's bad friend box?”

“Yes, me and Alex know him,” Mitch confirmed, his voice instantly colder. “He is a terrible person. We don’t associate with him anymore.”

Alex’s easygoing demeanor hardened slightly. “Yeah, I told Mitch my story about Andy. It was bad.”

“Now I want to meet this Andy you talk about,” Ela declared, her curiosity piqued.

“No, you don’t,” Alex stated firmly, his expression grim. “Trust me. He is mean, abusive, doesn’t respect anyone, will bombard your phone up with messages, and he is just not a good person.”

But Ela, with her big heart, felt a pang of sympathy. She began to think aloud, “Maybe… maybe he does those things because he’s hurting inside? And doesn't have any good friends or anyone who loves him?”

Tanya nodded, her gaze thoughtful. “Yeah, I agree. Sometimes people behave that way because they feel hurt and pain themselves.”

Alex, however, remained resolute. “No. I will never forgive Andy, ever. And I never want him to contact me ever again.”

Mitch agreed vehemently. “Absolutely. Ela, I advise you to never contact Andy. Seriously, cancel those plane tickets to DFW.”

Ela sighed, caught between her newfound love for California and an unexpected spark of empathy. “I might,” she said, “but I’ll think about it.”

Just then, Mitch announced he needed to use the restroom. Alex, ever the gracious host, offered to start cooking something up for lunch. Ela and Tanya remained in the living room, settling back into the comfortable couches. Alex, in his haste, had left his phone on the coffee table.

A moment later, the screen lit up. An incoming call. The name displayed clearly: *Andy*.

“Ela, what are you doing?” Tanya whispered, seeing Ela reach for the phone.

“I’m curious,” Ela whispered back, her eyes fixed on the vibrating device. “I want to contact Andy now.”

“No, no, no!” Tanya hissed, grabbing Ela’s arm. “This Andy person might be bad news. Mitch and Alex both said so!”

But Ela, with her unwavering heart, was already picturing Andy, alone and hurting, perhaps misunderstood. She wanted to try to help him, to get to know him beyond the severe warnings. She took a picture of the phone number that showed on the screen with a Dallas area code.

Just as the thought solidified, Alex returned, wiping his hands on a kitchen towel. “Alright, what kind of music are we listening to? Who’s everyone’s favorite singer?”

Ela, startled, pulled her hand back from the phone. “Oh! Olivia Rodrigo,” she blurted out.

Alex’s jaw dropped, then a wide smile spread across his face. “No way! I love Olivia Rodrigo too! My dad and I want to play some of her songs in the garage on our instruments.” He walked over to the coffee table to grab his phone, humming a tune from ""drivers license.""

His smile faded slightly as he saw the missed call notification. He frowned. “Whoops,” he muttered, tapping the screen. “I never want to hear from this guy ever again.” He realized he’d forgotten to put Andy back on block after getting a new phone. “Now I have to let Sharla know to let Andy know to never, ever contact me ever again. I also have to let Galen know too.”

Mitch, emerging from the hallway, nodded his approval. “Good idea. Just cut him off completely.”

Alex quickly navigated the settings on his phone, network blocking Andy’s number so he could never reach him again. The tension from the Andy discussion dissipated somewhat, replaced by the excited chatter about music. Soon, everyone made their way to Alex’s garage. Alex, Mitch, Alex’s father, and Alex’s cousin were already setting up their instruments. And soon, the garage was filled with the joyful sound of guitars, drums, and enthusiastic voices, echoing with the pop melodies of Olivia Rodrigo.

Since last week, I have stopped drinking coffee, started taking a 30-minute walk every day, and aim to finish dinner before 8 pm, allowing a two-hour gap between dinner and bedtime.

The Boston area is known for innovation — and this includes the hard-working sandwich artists improving on what’s already the perfect food. There’s a masterpiece around every corner — classic Italian subs stacked with imported meat and cheese, exquisitely crunchy bánh mì, meatloaf slathered in cheese and slapped between bread for healing after a night on the town. The sandos on The Boston Globe’s Best of the Best list are made with such care that they must be savored, but so good you’ll probably end up scarfing them down.

Dr. Ray Godfrey opened his eyes to be met with an oppressive darkness that weighed on him—the artificial shadow of a spacecraft interior, dimly lit by the cold glow of status monitors. 
His breath came slow and controlled, though his mind was sluggish—emerging from the sedatives used for long-duration cryosleep.
He flexed his fingers. Stiff, but expected. Even now, a full year out from Earth, the body revolted against its own survival. But Erebus-1 had been designed for this. So had he.
Just then, a soft chime rang through the cabin:

“Cryosleep cycle completed. Core systems nominal. Life support stabilizing.”

The words scrolled across the HUD of the cryopod’s roof, and his eyes flicked over the data feeds:

• CO2 scrubbers functional.
• Radiation shielding holding at 98.3% efficiency.
• Fusion reactor output stable.

No anomalies. No surprises.
He reached for the harness securing him to the cryopod, wincing as blood rushed sluggishly through his limbs. His body felt alien, caught between stasis and now. 

With a practiced motion, he released the restraints and floated up out of the cryopod.
Instinctively, he checked the windows:

Beyond the reinforced portholes, there was nothing. No planets. No moons. Not even the distant pinpricks of ships. 

Floating away, Ray keyed into the console located a bit away from the cryopod in the ship’s hull, sending a brief update to HQ. “Erebus-1, reporting wake cycle complete. Crew is to be accounted for. Resuming research on Origin Point Theta.”

A response would take days. He moved on.

Location: Interstellar Void, Sector JX-914, 0.3 LY from Origin Point Theta

	“Telemetry remains nominal. No gravitational anomalies detected. Pulse periodicity remains fixed at 1.46 seconds, originating from sector JX-914. No observable mass displacement, no heat signatures, no electromagnetic interference, though the raw energy this anomaly produces has seemingly only gotten more intense.

Conclusion: The source of the phenomenon remains unaccounted for. Continuing analysis.”

Personal Note: The disappearance of Monroe still haunts me; it has also prompted me to take her worries more seriously…I wish I had. I miss her.



New London, 2122—Before Departure

The electric lamps hummed softly as their light flickered across the walls. Papers sprawled across the mahogany desk, their edges curling with static ink. 

A holographic interface hovered beside them, equations blinking in pale blue, half-solved, though not abandoned.

In his study, Ray muttered, half-speaking, half-thinking aloud:

“No, no…a rounding error—ah, but the coefficient resists—” he swiped at the interface, dismissing a failed derivation. Rubbing his face, he let out a sharp sigh. “Damn it. Again.”

His gaze flickered across the data streams, hands tapping against his arm.

“Two-point-nine-seven times ten to the eighth…constant, unwavering. And yet—” he frowned, eyes narrowing. “All things decay, save light itself. But why?”

His hand tightened around his somewhat rugged stylus.

“A foolish thought. The universe does not yield so easily.”

And yet, the thought lingered, like an itch—
“Ray?” A woman’s voice called from behind him.

He didn’t turn at first.

“Ray, love, it’s past noon.” The voice was soft and patient.

He let out another sigh, turning left to look at the door.

There stood Thomason in the doorway, her hands folded neatly, and her bright green eyes watching him with the kind of knowing gaze that came from years of marriage.

“Just a moment,” muttered Ray.

“No, now. You’ve been at this since morning,” she retorted. “Come along, before the soup gets cold.”

Ray lingered and took one last glance at the data stream—but she was waiting.

And so, reluctantly, he dismissed the projection. 
He turned to her with a soft smile.
Thomason smiled back, warm and gentle, and linked her arm with his.

“I swear, one of these days, I’ll have to lock you out this room.”



They walked the carpeted hall—Ray with a confident stride, and Thomason with a smooth glide—and down the staircase together, their steps soft against the old flooring. 

Beyond the window, the city’s artificial sky pulsed with the faint shimmer of the weather dome, a vast Chronos Corp. Biosphere filtering the midday light over the high-rises of New London. The Chronos logo, subtle but omnipresent, gleamed on the surfaces of the tallest towers.

“The reports say the fighting in the East has worsened,” she murmured, her thumb rubbing against her fingers—an interesting trait inherited from her mother—“more deployments.”

Yet after a pause, her tone lightened. “I wonder how mother fares these days.”

Ray glanced down at her restless hands, then clasped one gently.

“No cause for worry, dear; you know she’s tough.”

Thomason looked from her hand to Ray, and smiled softly. “Yeah…you’re right.”

With that, they entered the kitchen:

The space had never been about appearances. No polished marble countertops, no sleek, modern features—that by now were seen as essential for comfortable living—save the induction stove and a few upgraded appliances. Just warm wooden cabinets, a sturdy farmhouse sink, and the old chipped ceramic mugs Thomason had sworn had “character.” 

The scent of simmering broth drifted through the kitchen as Thomason moved with ease, ladling a portion into a ceramic bowl. 

From the far right side of the kitchen, the kettle chimed softly.

Ray took his seat at the kitchen table, its surface worn by years of absentminded tapping. He adjusted his sleeves as he settled in.

Thomason placed the bowl before him, followed by a cup of freshly brewed tea, which Ray wasted no time in draining. 

Folding her arms, Thomason watched as he drank. A smile ghosted over her lips, though a faint crease lined her brow.

“You could’ve asked me for a cup earlier, you know.”

Ray set the empty cup down with a quiet clink, exhaling contentedly.

“Indeed, I could have.”

Thomason shook her head, half amused.
“You’d starve up there if I let you.”

She placed a spoon beside his bowl and took her seat. “Eat.”

Ray obliged, though his mind, ever restless, still lingered in the study, somewhere among the numbers.

Thomason set down her spoon, fingers resting lightly against the rim of her bowl. “I know your work is important,” she said. “Your…science group—”

“The Astronomical Standards Authority,” Ray corrected with a matter-of-fact tone.

She waved a hand. “Yes, yes, that. But I swear, you vanish into that study for days, chasing something invisible. Even at night, I hear you pacing.”

Ray leaned back, setting his spoon down as well. 

“There are problems in this world—problems that do not yield easily. But yield they must.” He glanced at the window, where the light beamed. “If a question presents itself, it is my duty to answer it.”

Thomason held his gaze for a moment before sighing, shaking her head with a tired smile. “And what of questions that have no answer?”

Ray’s lips quirked, just slightly. “All things yield, eventually.”


Morning light crept through the curtains of their bedroom, casting soft shadows across the polished wooden floor. 

Ray stood before the mirror, adjusting his suit jacket and smoothing his shirt with practiced precision. 

On his bedside terminal, the message delivered by the ASA in the late hours of the previous night remained displayed in crisp text:


	“Dr. Ray Godfrey, your immediate presence is requested at the Astronomical Standards Authority headquarters. A new intern has been assigned to your division. As the preeminent expert in our station, your guidance is indispensable. Report forthwith.

—Dr. James Albright”


A subtle thrill sparked in Ray as he tapped the screen, scrolling through the message once more as if to commit every word to memory.

With his tie now knotted, Ray moved to the window, his gaze lingering on the controlled bustle of the domed city. 

Then, with a flickering glance at the meticulously arranged room, his eyes landed on what was his only non-technological object: resting upon the shelf mounted to the left wall of their bedroom was a small wooden elk. His chest tightened, and with that, he gathered his belongings and descended the stairs.

In the kitchen, the aroma of bacon mingled with freshly brewed tea filled his nose. 

Thomason, moving from the kitchen table and to the living room, set down a plate of food onto a small wooden coffee table in the middle of said living room. “Are you off now?” she asked, as she sat down on the couch.

Ray took his seat on the couch beside Thomason. 

“Yes—a new intern has been assigned to my division. I am to provide guidance,” he replied as he sipped his tea, then began to eat.

Thomason nodded as she picked up the TV remote and put on “Are You a Cook, Or Crook?”, resting her head lightly on her hand. 

“Remember that not everyone can hold a conversation like some over-the-top genius.”

“Indeed, though you never know—maybe they might just surprise me,” Ray remarked with a slight wry smile, then resumed his meal.

After a pause, Thomason murmured, almost absentmindedly, “Lately, I've had the strangest feeling in my stomach.”

Ray looked up. “What do you mean?”

“I don’t know exactly—but it’s a vague feeling; I guess it’s like when you feel anxious,” she said, hesitating.

Ray set his plate aside and looked for a reason. 

“Maybe…a minor fluctuation in ambient pressure,” Ray offered. “The dome’s regulation is efficient, yet not entirely flawless.”

Thomason exhaled softly, looking down at the table for a moment. “You always have an explanation ready.”

Ray offered a faint smile, then rose from the couch. “Well, I must be off now. Love you, dear.” 

He leaned in to kiss her.

Thomason returned the kiss and squeezed his hand gently. “Don’t be out too long.”

Dusting himself off, Ray stepped toward the front door, then turned back to Thomason, adding, “I shall return before you miss me—give or take a year.”

With that, he opened the door and departed.

               “Telemetry remains nominal. Vessel trajectory stable; all onboard systems functioning within expected parameters. Pulse periodicity—previously unwavering at 1.46 seconds—ceased entirely for a duration of exactly two hours before resuming without explanation. No detectable external interference. No gravitational shifts, no anomalies in reactor output or shielding integrity. And yet, for two hours, it was gone.

Conclusion: The source remains unaccounted for.

Personal Note: The instruments recorded nothing unusual during the silence. No deviations, no disruptions—only absence. And yet, I felt it. A gap where something should have been. A space carved out of time itself. And now that it has returned, it feels… different, as though it has noticed me in turn. It does not press upon the hull, nor stir the vacuum, yet in the pit of my stomach, I sense it growing.
I shall increase biometric monitoring.”

My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small Minnesota town with a population of 1,400 people.
 We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.
It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted. 
As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.
“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 
“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied
“It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 
“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 
“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My brother said he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”
“Okay, but your brother is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 
As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 
“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  
They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 
“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 
“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 
“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled
I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 
I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 
“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically
“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 
I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 
“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 
“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 
“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 
“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 
“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.
I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 



TWO.
That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after, we named it the MidwestGhostHunters. We have been on a dozen hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 
The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.
I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 



THREE.
I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.
“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 
“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded
“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 
“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 
“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously
“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 
I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 
“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.
I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 
Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 
Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.
“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 
“What's that?” I asked 
“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down in Oklahoma. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 
“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  
“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 
Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 
“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 



FOUR.
It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first “Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” 
I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 
I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 
Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 
“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked
“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”
“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 
Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 
“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 
“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked
As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 
“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan
“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 
Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.
The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 
“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 
“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded
“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked
“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated
“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 
“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said
“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated
I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video. Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend, there are so many terrifying stories about this place, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 
I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 
“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally
“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 
“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 
“Yes please” I said dejectedly 
To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 
The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 
I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.
Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 
We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 
I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 
“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”
“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 
“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated
“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 
“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 
When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 
Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 
“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied
“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 
Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 
“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room
“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 
“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room
“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”
Knock,Knock,Knock
He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 
I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 
I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 
“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 
I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 
Knock,Knock,Knock
“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 
“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said
“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.
 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 
“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked
We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 
I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence. In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.
We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  
Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.
“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 
“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”
We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.





FIVE
The high school appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.
Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 
“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 
“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated
Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.
“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 
“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly
“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked
We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  
I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 

We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 

We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 
We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”
Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”
Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 
“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 
“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 
Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 



SIX.
The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 
“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” 
They paused to look around, Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 
Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 
“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  
They just shrugged and continued exploring.  

As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 
“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered
“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 
We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.
 I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 
I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 
“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.
We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 
She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 
Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.
“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 
I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.
“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 
I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.
We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 

We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 
“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.
“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.
“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd
Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 
“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded
“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 
“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 

We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying “LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.” She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 
We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 



SEVEN.
It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 
Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 
His message made me curious so I agreed.
“Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 
Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?
“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”
Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 
I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.
I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 
Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 
“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 
Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.
There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 
I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 



EIGHT.
I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 
Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 
 	We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 
Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  
We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 

Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 
The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.
I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 
The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”
The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 



NINE.
By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 
She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 
Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  
That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now. 
Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon

We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 
So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you

1m1zijo,https://www.reddit.com/r/skinwalkers/comments/1m1zijo/navajo_mountain_skinwalker/,Navajo Mountain Skinwalker,"My father and uncle have a story of living as outsiders (non-native, caucasian) young people on the reservation. Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there’s a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I’m mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I’m just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn’t too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn’t much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn’t the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy’s face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family’s home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle’s bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they’d seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn’t have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn’t explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn’t much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn’t supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn’t meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I’ve never been the same since.",1,1752731079.0,skinwalkers,0,0.67,False

1m1zbzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsettlingStories/comments/1m1zbzk/devil_in_the_dishwater/,Devil in the Dishwater,"A devil lives in the dirty dishes of my kitchen sink.



Let me explain.



I think it’s always lived there in the sludge-thick dishwater, between dirty spoons and rusty knives, but like many things, I didn’t notice. I’m not very good at doing the dishes or cooking meals.



Or doing anything, really.



I don’t know when it got there. Maybe after I went to the hospital, it moved into the dishes sitting neglected in the sink. Maybe it got in there one afternoon while I was at work, struggling to hear customers sex-phoning in their barely audible orders. Regardless, I didn’t know it was there until I was trying to wash the dishes one night after a ten-hour shift and cut my finger.



Disappointingly, the devil didn’t appear in a puff of sulfurous smoke to accept the blood sacrifice. Blood didn’t pour from the faucets. The water didn’t burn with black flames.



I just cried, threw the kitchen knife across the room, and went to bed to have a tantrum that didn’t even take the edge off my frustration, sobbing into my pillow that I needed help. Any help. I couldn’t do my dishes. I couldn’t keep my doctor appointments straight. I ran out of my favorite cup noodles, and when I tried to eat other food, my throat closed; it sat uncomfortably on my tongue, and my stomach turned off. I sucked the blood from my cut finger and pressed it hard until it stopped oozing before going to bed.



I woke up to the smell of coffee.



I promise I’m not stupid. I checked my windows and my front door. They were all locked, and there was dust on the windowsill undisturbed. I checked the coffee pot—just coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on the grounds. Sitting nearby was my favorite owl-shaped mug and the blueberry syrup I hadn’t gotten out in four months, with creamer still cold nearby. I don’t think I even owned creamer.



I should have thrown it out.



Instead, I made a cup of coffee with my treats, sat down, and drank it. I hadn’t made a cup of coffee in months.



I got dressed, went to work, and when I got home, everything was normal. No food waiting for me. No coffee. Just my cluttered apartment, my frozen dinner, and the unwashed dishes in the sink. I washed a fork, ignored my finger, and stared at the leftover mug between bites of food.



I could have ignored it all. The coffee pot was empty. No creamer in the fridge. My blueberry syrup was up in the cupboards. The owl mug, however, sat on the table with dregs of blueberry-scented coffee. I threw away my half-finished food to go to bed but couldn’t.



Instead, I walked to the sink, thanked nothing, and opened the scab on my finger. I squeezed it until several drops of blood fell onto the plates, then went to sleep. The next morning, another pot of coffee was waiting for me and a cheap breakfast sandwich.



So, I kept bleeding into my sink.



Every morning there was a breakfast sandwich and coffee. Every night I found a packet of ramen noodles with my preferred fixings. On rough days, it would be cooking for me with a clean bowl.



The dishes never changed. It didn’t matter how many dishes I cleaned; the pile seemed to remain the same. The only changes were what it gave me. On the days I found reality slipping away, there were energy drinks to jolt me back to reality. The days I couldn’t eat, it produced meal supplement shakes. When I sobbed in the shower over my inability to clean, I found my clothes clean, my bed made, and the floor vacuumed.



I had learned not to ask for help, yet with some blood? I had help.



It told me that it could help more if I gave more. I bled heavier into the sink. I bought mice from the store and left their cages beside the sink. I can’t stand to kill them, but I don’t need to. By morning, the cages are empty.



My meals are better, and my apartment is tidier. When my medication runs out, it’s somehow full. It’s not a million dollars, but it gives me breathing room.



I need that so terribly.



I still have bad days, and one day sent me home early from work. I let myself in and walked to the sink to talk while I cut open my finger—to tell it about my day; about how much I need it. I barely noticed the stranger watching me from around the hall’s corner. When he stepped closer, I was so startled that I was completely unprepared.



I remember hot blood on my hands, then his hands around my throat, my head on the wall, and everything went fuzzy. I hit the ground. He stood over me. Something reached out of the sink and grabbed his arm with hands like broken china and slick rot.



Everything went gray then.



I woke up to a cold tongue lapping the blood from my head.



He has a body now. He still drinks my blood, sometimes more than I can give. He makes up for it by cooking, cleaning, and making my life easier. So much easier that I decided to pay him back by going on a date tonight.



I made a profile on an app, made sure to include DTF, and after being assaulted by more faceless Johnsons than I’d ever wanted to see, I picked the most insistent one and gave them my address. I said I wanted a quiet night in.



Now we’re waiting. He’s shown me how to cut under the armpit, and that he’ll take care of the rest. He said it will be enough for our contract for another month. He says there will be nothing left, and I believe him. Why wouldn’t I?

I did ask the author via discord if I could use their story as a premise with some tweaks. This is also the second draft; I made the first one and posted it like a year and a half ago, which admittedly wasn’t very good. So here I am again, hoping you enjoy it!

Couldn’t post the entire story in one go, so I guess this is the first half (or maybe 1/3).

———————— • ———————-


Chapter 1:

High Strategos Miz, 7th seat of the Pact Council.

They came from the edge, the forgotten dark corner of our galaxy, that thin layer of stars clinging to the spiral arm’s end.

A neglected cradle of filth and iron, untouched by conquest simply because no one thought anything of value could crawl out of it.

We do not know their origin. Only the direction. A place we had long dismissed.

An unclaimed, unscanned, and unneeded section. A backwater beyond the margins of conquest.

The first contact was a minor incident. A planet ceased transmission at the edge of one of our Empires. Then a trade route fell silent. 

At first, we assumed pirate incursions, nothing major. Then more systems started going dark. Perhaps it was insurgent remnants. It was beneath our concern.

We spanned millions of stars. Our fleets blot out constellations. Our machines grind moons into metal. We enslaved or destroyed any species we came across. To us, war was not a contest. It was routine.

So when the unknown ships began carving paths through our outer systems, we responded as we always had: with overwhelming force.

I remember the first great engagement. Ten thousand fleets with dreadnoughts the size of continents. We expected to extinguish them with ease.

But when the humans came… something felt wrong.

Their ships were ugly. Things that moved just like ours. Weapon profiles, power signatures, tactical formations all frighteningly familiar. It was as if someone had taken our own designs and… Twisted them through some alien logic. Less refined, less elegant. 

But they were faster; more brutal.

They knew our moves before we even made them.

Our multi-layered defense formation collapsed in twenty three minutes. The Burtan war-kings, whose ancestors made suns into weapons, retreated. They had not retreated in two thousand years.

We lost. And worse of all, we didn’t understand why.

We captured some of their wreckage and tore it apart. Every circuit, every alloy, it was wrong. As if built by minds that thought in ways we couldn’t trace or even begin to understand.

The only constant we found was the symbol: Humanity.

A name now spoken in hushed tones across our worlds.

Who are they? How did they rise in the void without us noticing? How do they know our tactics, our technologies, our weaknesses? Are they the remnants of some forgotten failed empire? A discarded experiment? Something older?

None of us have answers.

So, in our fear, we formed the Pact.

We, the cruel, the invincible, the apex civilizations, who warred across millennia, who enslaved each other’s kin, who poisoned worlds just to keep them from our rivals now kneel side by side. Not in loyalty, this was a move made in desperation. In shared dread of an enemy we still don’t understand and the fear of extinction.

We have amassed our greatest fleets, our most potent minds, our last dreadnoughts and even weapons we never thought we would one day need. And we just threw them at the humans.

But it’s still futile, because it seems they just get stronger with each battle.

Even as I leave this recording to you, deep within the Core Systems, a transmission pings across twenty subspace layers:

Another system has fallen.

We thought ourselves Gods.
Now, we are prey.

Chapter 2:

Location: The Hall of Accord, Pact Council Citadel, Core World

There were eight of them. Each a legend, each representing a civilization whose reach spanned sectors beyond counting.

They were not accustomed to the fear they felt today.

High Strategos Miz of the Kheth Dominion sat coiled in his seat, his armored tendrils twitching as holograms of burning systems flickered before him. To his left, Archmind Veil of the Biem Ascendancy hovered silently, its color dull with exhaustion. The Morix Hive-Queen floated in a nutrient cloud, silent but humming a low, anxious tremor that could be felt through the floor.

The air itself buzzed with thick tension. The humans were pushing further inward every second.

In just twenty galactic years, they had broken through five core defense rings. Seventeen major worlds were gone… Not even conquered, they didn’t even bother with the resources. They were just destroyed. 

Their tactics defied every projection and algorithm. The humans weren’t simply aggressive, this war seemed personal. 

They were always using precise force, always where the Pact was weakest.

“We must abandon the outer lines,” spat Lord Xayun of the Minlu Empire. “Every ship holding those sectors is just being wasted.”

“And let them slice deeper?” hissed the Hive-Queen through her voice-chamber. “You would feed them our marrow.”

“They’re already at our marrow,” Miz growled. “We lose thirty systems a week. Every projection ends in collapse. We are not winning, we are barely surviving.”

“You call this survival?” Archmind Viel said in a raised voice, gesturing to the projection of a ruptured world. “We bleed our worlds to the last grain and gain nothing. Their numbers are finite, but their knowledge… it is as if they anticipate every outcome before it unfolds.”

The council erupted into argument- accusations, denials, ancient grudges resurfacing. Old rivalries flared, barely contained behind the curtain of alliance.

Then the doors slammed open.

A messenger stumbled in. It was a lean, pale being from the Scyris race, clutching a datacore with shaking claws and an expression none of them had seen in months.

Hope.

“A prisoner,” he gasped. “From the mining Ambush, a human.” He takes another breath “We extracted data from its implants before it… died. We believe-”

He smiled, wild and desperate.

“-we found their system of origin!”

The chamber fell silent.

No one spoke. Even the Hive-Queen’s drones froze in their orbit. Viel’s tentacles rembled.

“You’re certain?” Miz asked, his voice very low but still holding the aura of command.

“As certain as we can be. The signal matches their jump-point histories. All traces converge on a single system. It’s a remote location, near the galactic edge. A small, young star, circled by eight worlds.”

No name. No maps. Just direction. But it was more than they’d ever had.

For a long moment, no one moved.

Then Archmind Viel said, “If we strike it, we buy time. Perhaps even… end this war.”

“It is a gamble,” muttered another. “If we are wrong-”

“If we do nothing,” Miz cut in, “we die.”

He stood.

“Summon the fleets.”

“You mean-”

“All of them.”

The air trembled with this declaration. They were going all in on a gamble; leaving everything else unprotected. But at this point, they were out of options.

Every eye and sensory organ turned to the massive display that now bloomed above them: over 13 million dreadnoughts, and billions of smaller ships red-lit and ready, converging on a single destination.

If they could strike the humans at their root, perhaps the galaxy could breathe again.

Perhaps.

They called the system nothing.

At the edge of the galaxy a system awaited them, and around it, the world of humans.

Chapter 3:

Designation: Sub-Command Executor Thalen-Ru of the Ikaros Spire
Ship: Scourged Grace, 9th Reserve Invasion Fleet

They told him command was an honor.

Thalen-Ru stood before the view-slit of his new ship, hands clasped behind his back in what he hoped was a dignified posture. The war priests had intoned his name with ceremony. The medals still clinked faintly on his shoulders. 

He had graduated from the Horan War Academies two years early, top of his class, personally praised by a Hive-lord for his simulated flanking strategy.

He was ready to write his legacy in fire and victory.

But no one told him the Scourged Grace was falling apart.

It had once been a proper vessel, a subjugation barge used to crush planetary insurrections during the Chutari Uprisings. It was designed for planetary orbiting, glassing, troop drops, and high-capacity transit. In theory, it was a warship.

In practice, it had been cannibalized so many times that the original hull plating had long since been replaced with industrial alloys. Half the weapons banks were now storage containers. The targeting systems were two generations out of date. The ship’s spine groaned constantly, one of the engineers had referred to it as a “dying crawler dragging itself across the stars.”

Inside, it was packed solid.

Twenty-five million soldiers.
Roughly divided between five species, basically a small army of each species that wasn’t hive-minded was on the ship. Each crammed into reconfigured cargo bays, sleeping in shifts, surrounded by drones, walkers, grav-tanks, skirmish pods, and small fighters. The entire interior stank of oil, chemical food paste, and fear.

“Command Executor,” his adjutant; a four-eyed Straxilite named Reek, floated beside him, spindly and efficient. “Fleet position confirmed. We are slotted as rear-guard for primary phase landing. Current orders are to hold until Fleet Admiral Berno’s formation, clears orbital space and secures an insertion window.”

In other words: wait until the real war was done.

Thalen-Ru nodded, hiding his disappointment.

He had dreamed of glory. Leading a firestorm down through the skies of the human homeworld and personally accepting the surrender of their leaders. He had hopes of stepping across their broken relics and declaring the rise of a new galactic age.

Instead, he was to be a glorified janitor, mopping up the leftovers.

Still, he reminded himself, victory is a staircase. Every step counted.

“Any projections on resistance?” he asked.

Reek’s skin flushed a concerned green. “Low to moderate. Based on predictive modeling, once their orbital defense grid is shattered, humans will likely deploy ground assets in decentralized cells. Scattered resistance, sabotage battalions, anti-air weapons. Our job will be to sweep, secure, and neutralize these forces.”

“Not glamorous,” Thalen-Ru muttered.

“But essential,” Reek replied.

They watched the holo-feed of the fleet. A staggering wall of war. Billions of ships, all pointed toward a single star.

This was the largest military formation in the galaxy’s recorded history. You could burn even the most fortified planet a trillion times over with this kind of firepower. And at the rear of it all, drifting like a rusted cargo hauler, was the Scourged Grace.

Thalen-Ru’s command, bloated with infantry and expectation.

He turned from the view, letting the steel cool his ambition.

He would prove himself. He would make his mark in the war chronicles. Even if he was handed a poor excuse of a ship held together with tape and prayer.

Because no matter how old the vessel, no matter how thankless the mission, he would be the one to land boots on the human homeworld.

And that, he thought, was history.

Chapter 4:

Location: Unidentified System, Aboard the Scourged Grace*

They entered slip-space at precisely the designated moment. Twenty-three seconds behind the Fleet Admiral’s flagship, within the rear quarter of Formation Line Zeta. Sensors were alive with fleet chatter. Navigation relays blinked.

The slip-space transition was violent.

The Scourged Grace shook violently. Lights burst. In the troop holds, soldiers slammed into each other and the bulkheads, screaming in confusion. For a heartbeat, the Scourged Grace seemed to fold in on itself.

Thalen-Ru snapped upright in his command chair. “Report!”

Reek was already at the station, limbs moving in a blur. “Slip-space turbulence, possibly harmonic interference. Recalibrating vectors- wait-”

Then, with a deep, sickening lurch, the ship tore free from the void and slammed back into normal space.

The silence that followed was immediate and heavy.

Thalen-Ru clutched his hands, knuckles pale beneath. “Status?”

Reek was already sifting through garbled diagnostics, his many limbs moving with practiced urgency. “We… are no longer in fleet formation.”

Thalen-Ru blinked. “What?”

The main screen lit up. A gas giant loomed in the distance, marbled with browns and oranges, ringed by thin bands. A cold star hung nearby, casting pale light on the distant system. No other ships in sight. No comms traffic. No subspace chatter. Just… emptiness.

“We lost the fleet,” Reek said with a tight voice.

“Impossible. We were deep in the jump corridor. Surrounded by ships on every side.”

Reek shook his head. “Not anymore. Scans show no friendly drives, no fleet signatures. Just… this system.”

Thalen-Ru’s mandibles tightened. “Then we were knocked off vector. Most likely a slingshot effect by so many ships jumping at the same time. damned ship’s a relic.” He turned toward his engineers. “How bad is it?”

The slip-space technician didn’t meet his eyes. “Drive core’s intact, but stabilizers are ruptured. Quantum meter is cracked along four anchor points. We’re lucky the ship didn’t tear itself apart.”

“Can it be repaired?”

“Not without dock facilities. Or… raw materials….” The tech hesitated. “We also… don’t have mining drones on this ship anymore.”

Thalen-Ru exhaled slowly. He remembered the pre-launch refits. Scourged Grace had been stripped for parts a dozen times over. It wasn’t really much of a warship anymore, just a glorified troop hauler duct-taped into usefulness by desperation and time.

“How long can we hold?”

“Fuel reserves: stable. Structural integrity: declining slowly so it’s manageable. But food stores…” Reek pulled up a number. “We have less than one standard galactic year of preserved rations. With current numbers…” Reek pulls the screen showing 25.3 million troops “…We’ll run out in nine months unless rationing is enforced.”

So they were stranded, under-supplied, and armed with an entire invasion force.

“Any signs of civilization?” Thalen-Ru asked.

Reek pointed to a signal marker pulsing on the edge of the display. “Third planet from the star. Breathable atmosphere. Moderate biosignatures. And… something else.”

He expanded the readout.

“Artificial transmissions.“

Thalen-Ru leaned in, intrigued. “Tech level?”

“Primitive,” Reek confirmed. “Wide-band analog. Open. Unsecured. Easily intercepted. Late atmospheric age. No indication of FTL or orbital defense.”

A planet full of resources. Organic biomass. Possibly metals, fuel stock, water. Primitive defense. And no hope of counterattack.

“A pre-FTL world,” he said. “Unaligned. No contact. No protection.”

He paused for a second. Then a thin smile could be seen across his face.

“They have resources. Materials. Perhaps even something else we can use… slaves. This world is wide open. Lazy even.”

He stared at the glowing signal. He had come expecting the crucible of history- the battle for the human homeworld. Instead, he found an unknown world with tools from another age and a weak bond barely holding onto civilization.

But it was alive, and it could sustain them.

He straightened, drawing the eyes of the bridge crew.

“We have no choice. No allies and no time. We cannot wait for rescue here. We take that world, strip it for resources and establish a forward base. Repair the slip-drive if possible or transmit a distress signal and wait it out until rescue finds us.”

He looked out at the void, jaw tight.

“This may not be the glory I trained for… But if we claim a world alone, with no fleet, no reinforcements… that is worth a legacy.”

He turned back to his crew.

“Set trajectory. Manual burns only, we can’t risk destroying this thing. Estimated arrival?”

“Three standard galactic months,” Reek answered. “Four and a half of their planetary months.”

“Begin atmospheric infiltration planning. Three galactic months until arrival. Plenty of time to prepare for a full planetary subjugation.” Thalen-Ru then nodded. “Then let’s begin. Ready the troops. Let them know: conquest begins early.”

Perhaps, he thought, if this backwater was notable enough, his name would still echo in the war chronicles. Not as a failure, but as the first to conquer this planet, and best of all, alone. Even if the planet was primitive.

Chapter 5:

Location: Table Mountain Observatory, California
Subject: Charles H. Wexler, NASA Intern – Astrophysics Division

Charles had dreamed of this for years.

The observatory dome whispered as it rotated, aligning its ancient bones with the heavens above. Quiet, methodical, elegant. Machines built to watch the infinite, to listen when the cosmos said nothing.

It was beautiful up here; far from the cities, far from the constant thrum of civilization. Just wind, rock, and sky. The stars felt closer.

He was only three weeks into his internship at NASA, yet they had already shipped him off to the Table Mountain Facility. Most of the team was preparing for a much-needed vacation in Las Vegas, some government-sponsored morale event. 

He wasn’t going, he had the sky to keep him company.

Charles exhaled softly and adjusted the scope again, nudging the instruments toward Europa. The pale moon hovered like a ghost behind Jupiter’s looming shadow, its icy shell shimmering faintly against the backdrop of space.

He smiled.

Then he saw it. A flicker.

A glint? No it was movement.

It was subtle, but unmistakable. Something behind Europa, just at the edge of visibility. Too brief to analyze. A sliver of shadow where there shouldn’t have been one.

Charles froze.

Was it a satellite? A glitch in the monitor? A passing cloud caught in the upper atmosphere refracting light? The Earth’s spin did strange things to perception at this magnification.

Charles blinked, leaned in, rewound the feed, but he found nothing. Whatever it was, it was gone. No trail, no distortion. Just clean, quiet space.

He sat back, rubbing his eyes.

“Okay, Wexler,” he muttered to himself. “Too much coffee. Too little sleep.”

Still… he couldn’t shake the feeling.

The next day, he checked the logs. Hours of footage from that quadrant. Europa and the void around it. All clean. All unremarkable. The data said nothing had happened.

But his gut disagreed.

By day three, he was obsessed with this.

While his colleagues were drinking overpriced cocktails and losing their paychecks at blackjack tables, Charles was staring through long-range optics, pouring over light patterns, manually scrubbing footage frame by frame. He tuned out messages from his supervisor. Ignored his inbox. Barely ate.

Always looking at Europa.

He didn’t know why he was so drawn to it now. The logical part of his mind knew this was probably just a sunspot or cosmic dust, some fleeting phenomenon magnified by fatigue. But the feeling wouldn’t go away.

It wasn’t fear nor curiosity, it was something between the two.

That night, just past 2 AM, it happened again.

Not just a flicker. He now saw a shape.

Dark and distinctly artificial. It hovered just past Europa’s curvature, for only a second, but it was there. The moon’s light warped faintly as something massive slipped across its edge.

Charles jerked back from the terminal, his pulse pounding.

It wasn’t a natural object. It wasn’t ice. It wasn’t shadow and it was not his mind playing tricks on him.

Something had moved behind Europa. Something big. And now he was terrified.

Not in the paranoid, government-conspiracy sort of way. No. This was something more primal.

He stared at the screen, nothing remained but his instincts screamed.

Charles stood, stepped back from the console. His heart was hammering. He reached for his notepad, hands trembling, and jotted down everything; time, coordinates, scope angle. 

Tomorrow, he’d begin proper tracking protocols. Calibrate the observatory for deep-field capture, and record everything.

He didn’t know what he’d seen.

But whatever it was… it wasn’t natural.

And he would be damned if he let the sky hide it from him again.

Chapter 6:

Location: Uncharted System (Later Identified as Sol), Aboard the Scourged Grace*

Two days had passed since the jump. The violent lurch through slip-space that had ripped them away from the fleet, from the war, from the future.

And in that time, the mood aboard the Scourged Grace had undergone a complete transformation.

What had begun as confusion and dread had evolved into something else. It was exhilaration.

“Commander,” Reek said, limbs jittering with an energy, “we’ve confirmed it. This system is the one the humans came from. Their homeworld… is real. And we’re here.”

Thalen-Ru stood before the command deck’s main display as the holographic model of the planet rotated slowly in midair. Blue seas, green landmasses, scattered urban heat signatures. Earth.

Kind of ironic they would name their planet dirt when it’s mostly water.

“We’ve triangulated its identity through the radio emissions,” Reek continued. “They keep broadcasting it. In music, in signals, in primitive language. Earth, they call it.”

Thalen-Ru narrowed his eyes, studying the projection. No orbital defenses. No satellite weapon grids. No tactical stations on the planet’s single moon. Nothing on the surrounding worlds. Just a mess of analog noise and fractured global chatter.

No united front. No warning. No war machine.

He turned away from the display, voice low but filled with awe.

“This… is humanity. Before they became monsters.”

The revelation had stunned the crew. At first, the idea was unthinkable. 
Time travel? But the pieces fit too perfectly to deny: the dated star maps, the ancient radio tech, the infant state of human society.

They hadn’t missed the human system.

They had arrived before it mattered.

Thalen-Ru had spent hours poring over the intercepted transmissions. Petty arguments about territorial lines. War threats between neighboring tribes. Even visual media, crude digital projections of stories; entertainment from a simpler age. No coordination. No shared purpose. A fractured, chaotic species still ruled by emotion and flesh-bound politics.

He smiled again, it seemed like he was always smiling these past couple days.

If the humans of this era were anything like the ones he’d studied, there would be no peace, no chance for negotiation. And that meant…

Justification.

A clean invasion. No Pact tribunals. No accusations of stepping out of line. If anything, this would be seen as a preemptive strike. A galaxy-saving blow delivered before humanity’s rise.

He would not return home as the officer who missed the war.

He would return as the one who ended it before it began.

Around him, the bridge buzzed with life. Officers moved briskly, relaying commands. Systems checked and rechecked. Schedules prepared. The Scourged Grace might be slow, might be outdated. But now it carried history in its hold.

“Morale report?” Thalen-Ru asked.

Reek twitched all of his limbs in what passed for a grin. “High, Commander. Exceptionally high. Word has spread. Everyone knows. We’re not fighting the humans, we’re conquering proto-humans. It’s going to be a harvest.”

Thalen-Ru gave a satisfied nod.

Reek leaned in closer, antennae twitching with excitement.

“Between you and me,” he said, voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “I just hope I get assigned to civilian containment detail. Have you seen the images they transmit of their females? Bipedal, symmetrical, soft features~ Gods, I’d do unspeakable things for a few days on the surface.”

He trembled visibly. “I have a thing for smooth-skinned species. Fewer limbs than me, it’s just-” He shuddered again. “Delicious.”

Thalen-Ru stared at him flatly for a moment.

“Just don’t break anything we might need for later.”

Reek laughed. “No promises.”

The commander turned back to the holo-display, watching Earth spin slowly on its axis. Their target. Their salvation. Their ticket home.

It was still months away. Three standard galactic months, by their estimates. The ship’s primary engines had to be stretched to the limit, pushing their massive weight planet by planet, burning fuel they barely had.

But spirits were high.

Weapons were being prepped.

Assault plans were drafted.

History was waiting.

And Thalen-Ru would carve his name into the stars; not as the last soldier in the war against humanity… but the first.

Chapter 7:

Location: Table Mountain Observatory → Earth at large
Subject: Charles H. Wexler – NASA Intern

At first, it was just a flicker.

Now, it was a conversation the world couldn’t stop having.

Two days after Charles had first seen the strange, angular shadow blink into visibility behind Jupiter’s moon, Europa, the governments of Earth were already whispering.

Charles wasn’t the only one who noticed. Civilian astronomers across the world had begun reporting odd movement near the gas giant. A shimmer. A distortion. Something not right. Most of them assumed it was a classified satellite or an unannounced asteroid under observation.

But when the calls started going out from nation to nation, each asking the other “Is this yours?” the answer was the same.

No.

The United States didn’t claim it.
Russia didn’t claim it.
China, Europe, India, Israel, even North Korea. They all denied ownership.

That left… something else.

The object was still too far to be confirmed publicly, but every space agency had their eyes on it now. Quiet orders were passed: observe, analyze, contain. And do not tell the public. Not yet. Not until they knew what it was.

Charles couldn’t sleep.

The anxiety had sunk deep into his gut. The object wasn’t drifting aimlessly, it was moving toward Earth. Its trajectory was undeniable. Its speed, its momentum, it was no rock caught in gravity’s pull.

It was coming straight for us.

They’d estimated impact, no, arrival in four months.

To distract himself, Charles opened Reddit on his phone. Maybe someone else out there was seeing it too. He scrolled. One post caught his eye on the r/Astronomy thread.

[What’s this?!]

A blurry telescope photo. Faint. Far away. A speck, barely more than noise.

The top comments laughed it off.

“Weird rock maybe?”
“Elon testing something again probably.”
“Aliens LMAO.”

But others were less casual.

“That’s not an asteroid. Look at the symmetry.”
“Are these aliens?”
“It’s too smooth.”

He scrolled for hours. Posts. Theories. Jokes. Panic. He didn’t know what he wanted, confirmation? Denial? All he knew was that something was out there, and no one could explain it.

Eventually, exhaustion took him. Charles collapsed onto his cot at the observatory and passed out just past midnight.

When he woke, the world had changed.

The object was everywhere.

On the news. On social media. On the radio. Trending hashtags clogged every feed.

#TheVisitor
#NotAnAsteroid
#AlienContact
#Don’tLookUp

Everyone had an opinion. Enthusiasts posted telescope images. Grainy videos flooded in from stargazers, backyard observatories, old enthusiasts with gear decades out of date; but they all showed the same thing:

It was real, and it was coming.

News anchors laughed nervously as they replayed footage from Armageddon. Others aired Don’t Look Up in morbid irony. People joked, “At least we’ll get closure on the Fermi Paradox.”

Others didn’t laugh.

Extremist groups declared it divine judgment. Apocalyptic preachers filled the streets. Protesters chanted in front of government buildings. Online markets were stripped clean. Blackouts in major cities. Explosions in downtown areas. The world was unraveling under the weight of a truth no one had prepared for.

And Charles?

He posted the truth.

A blurry image of the object captured from the facility’s monitor. Not an asteroid. Not a satellite. Not a natural body.

A ship.

Its silhouette, now undeniably artificial.

He uploaded it to every platform he could.

“These are aliens!! Omfg!!”

It went viral in under two hours.

Months passed. The world refused to return to normal.

Global leaders gave joint addresses. The President of the United States stood before a shaken press corps and confirmed it plainly:

“This object is not human in origin. We do not believe it is from Earth. This may be the first contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence in the history of mankind.”

There was no turning back now.

NASA confirmed it. ESA confirmed it. China, Russia, everyone. The object had altered course several times to maintain a direct path to Earth. It was piloted.

But its signals… were silent.

Despite the combined efforts of every communications agency on the planet, no message had been received. No reply, no response. It simply kept drifting toward Earth, slowing gradually.

Not falling, nor crashing. It was Arriving.


Charles left the city a week before the expected arrival, but the ship was basically already there by the time he made up his mind.

The chaos was too much, sirens every few minutes, military lockdowns, roaming blackouts. 

He couldn’t work, couldn’t think, he just wanted to see his sister. To be home.

He sat for hours in traffic on Highway 138, surrounded by thousands of other Americans trying to escape. A procession of fear, stretching across the desert.

And there, in the open sky, it floated.

The ship.

So close now it could be seen with the naked eye.

It hung like a second moon; immense, silent, too structured to be mistaken for anything else. A silhouette against the stars, its hull alien and unknowable. No visible lights or sounds. Just its sheer presence, suffocating and absolute.

A massive shadow, just outside the atmosphere. Parked over Earth’s front lawn.

Still, the governments tried to reach it.

They sent messages on every band. Radio, visual, digital, subspace. If they could think of it, they tried it.

No answer.

No welcome, no threat, just silence.

And all the while, the world watched. holding its breath beneath an indifferent machine of metal and silence.

⸻

Chapter 8:

Location: Southern California Highway / Global Orbit / Table Mountain Observatory Feed
Subject: Charles H. Wexler – NASA Intern, Eyewitness to First Contact

The message came when the ship was practically overhead.

For days, governments around the world had flooded every channel with diplomatic messages. Radio, microwave, lasers, encrypted bands, open broadcasts, even old Morse code.

Desperate to establish contact. And finally, it answered.

The sound came through deep-space listening stations first. A low, guttural growl of syllables twisted around an alien rhythm. Untranslatable. Harsh. Aggressive.

Across war rooms and science hubs, people leaned in. Analysts recorded it. Linguists stared blankly. AI transcription models failed within seconds.

Every major agency sent the same reply:
“We do not understand you. Please respond in a known language.”

The response came less than thirty seconds later.

A harsh screech could be heard, and then, in clear, flawless English:

“Die, humans. For we are the Pact. And you are the plague of the galaxy.”

The words echoed across the control rooms of Earth, silencing generals, presidents, prime ministers, scientists.

It was not a declaration, it was a sentence.

Then, from the massive ship overhead, a soft purple light began to pulse.

⸻

Charles sat frozen in his car, traffic gridlocked across every lane of the highway, the world around him buzzing with the faint whine of incoming messages and people screaming into phones.

He looked out his window.

And saw the light.

It shimmered down like a curtain of purple fire, stretching across the sky in rhythmic pulses. At first beautiful. Almost hypnotic. But it kept growing, brighter, wider, faster.

Then… it ignited.

A sun was born in the upper atmosphere.

The blast was soundless at first, just a violent white light so intense it erased all shadows in an instant. Charles had time to blink, to gasp-

And then everything turned to chaos.

A second sun roared across the sky, traveling at ten percent the speed of light, slamming into Earth’s magnetic field. The ionization wave that followed was like nothing humanity had ever faced.

Skies turned to flame.

Satellites fried instantly. Communications blacked out. The ISS—if it still existed—was vaporized before anyone could see it.

The only thing saving Earth from total annihilation was the planet’s magnetic field, absorbing and redirecting just enough of the blast to prevent surface vaporization. But it wasn’t enough to shield the world from the shockwave….

Charles awoke upside down.

His car was a crushed shell of twisted metal, half-buried in the remnants of the freeway and around him, fire flickered. The cncrete had been torn apart by the blast’s pressure. Other cars were piled in mangled mountains. Some were simply gone.

He couldn’t hear anything.

Only a ringing.

His vision swam, one eye left nearly blind from a glass shard that hit him just above his eyebrow. His hands trembled as he touched his own face, fingers coming away sticky with blood.

He screamed- but no sound came out, and so his Instinct took over.

He clawed at the car door, kicking it open with what little strength he had, stumbling onto the shattered highway. 

His lungs burned. The air was wrong, it felt metallic, burning, full of ash.

And then he looked up.

The ship.
Still floating, silent, and pulsing.

Only now… it had opened.

From its underbelly spilled dozens of smaller ships—angular, dart-like things with violet contrails and spinning limbs. They descended in coordinated formations, gliding down across cities and military bases, other ships flying towards the ocean and beyond.

Some of Earth’s jets scrambled to intercept.

Charles saw two streak upward into the sky, blazing contrails behind them.

One was shot down within seconds.

He could see the second getting smaller and smaller, and never return.

He finally started to hear again, and around him, the world screamed.

Sirens, gunfire, a pulse sound, not quite sonic, not quite solid. It was the alien weapons discharging. He could hear automatic rifles in the distance, the desperate sounds of police and National Guard opening fire.

And then he saw them, the creatures.

Silhouettes in the haze. Multi-limbed figures darting between streets, armored and fast. Others skittered, dragging glowing equipment, hissing commands in their foreign tongue.

They moved with purpose.

And they were not here to talk.

Charles ran.

He didn’t know where. Just away. Blood streamed from his scalp, soaking his shirt. Every joint screamed. His legs were heavy. His vision flickered. But he still ran.

The sky looked wrong. Like the northern lights had descended on California. 

Ribbons of plasma danced in the atmosphere, distorting colors. 

Trees were burning, cars exploded, people ran, screamed, died everywhere.

He coughed blood. He couldn’t breathe, but he couldn’t stop.

He ran until his body collapsed beneath him, knees giving out, his skin scorched, and his eyes barely able to focus.

In the far distance, something exploded.

In the sky above, the ship remained; like a Deity watching from Olympus.

Charles’s world dimmed. Darkness started to take his vision. All he could hear was the faint whisper of wind, and the distant scream of a dying city.

1m1z9zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m1z9zb/i_keep_getting_told_i_look_like_different_people/,I Keep Getting Told I Look Like Different People [Part 2],"I've been feeling more irritable lately. I don't know if it's because of the lack of success in my job hunt, no sleep, or the stress beating me into the ground.

  
It's been a few weeks since I [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/s/bbgqnvtHvw) about this. Trying to make sense of it all.



Now, this is a good way to recount what's happening so I don't forget. I’m starting to take a mental note of every strange event that happens and how often.



Everything is just pissing me off lately. My mood swings are getting a little out of hand, and I'm starting to see things. Or my imagination is playing tricks on me. Who knows.



At this point, I feel like something’s very wrong, but I don’t want to admit it to myself.



Small chunks of time have gone missing. So this is a good way for me to keep track.



At first, it was nothing, I'd space out for a few moments and forget what I was doing. Nothing new. Just seemed like an ordinary problem that many people had.



Now, it's getting more gradual. Thirty minutes to an hour goes missing, and I wouldn't know how I got there or what I was doing.



Which is so fucking dangerous considering I have to watch over my seven-year-old. I don’t want another potential blackout to somehow put her in danger.



I explained the tunnel vision I had last time, how my line of sight faded into the center of my gaze. Well, that's still happening, and more frequently.



If that wasn’t bad enough, I'm also starting to notice some creepy shit.



Last week, I was at the park with Zoey when I noticed someone staring in my direction. They were an older man that possessed the most menacing, and coldest scowl that peered through my soul.



His face appeared to be swelling like that of a corpse dumped in a lake, and his eyes were sinking into his puffy flesh.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was an imposter. His eyes were fake.



Not only that, they were glowing an unnatural, pale yellow that was pulsing. A low-pitched hum accompanied with a vibration became present within my skull.



It almost looked like his arms were growing, and his head was turning clockwise more and more. I couldn’t break this staring contest.



Zoey excitedly yelled, ""Daddy, look at me!"" as she went down the slide, and my attention shifted back to her. I look back at the man, and he's completely normal.



I reverted back to my initial thought that I was just seeing things, and repressed it. Nothing I could do.



I started my day off today with a cup of black coffee to fully stimulate my mind. My mom was working at her business and Zoey was in school so I had the place to myself.



Once I was mentally awake, I couldn’t help but think about my life lately. It truly felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.



So, I did the same thing I usually do as part of a variety of ways I like to cope with stress. The house looked messy, so I started to manically deep clean everything.



I picked up every piece of trash and used bowl or cup I could find around the place, wiped down counters, did the dishes, put laundry through, and my anxiety lessened the deeper I got in the process. Clean house, clean mind.



I was vacuuming in the living room with my headphones blaring screaming metal. Seems kind of contradictory to blast metal when I’m high-strung, but I’m weird like that.



I was coming around the corner of the sectional couch with the vacuum when I briefly noticed something in my peripheral vision. Down the dark hallway, for a split second, a shadow was roaming.



Then it was gone, sucked back into the void. Like noticing caused it to immediately scurry away.



Whispering approached me again. Vague at first, then growing but still distant. I tried really hard this time to pay attention to what I was hearing.



I thought I could make out chanting.



Then it stopped. I lied to myself again, believing it was nothing.



I can’t tell if I’m losing my grip on reality, or something more sinister is at play here.



After I cleaned the whole place, I decided to go to Safeway to pick up some groceries for the week. I was walking from my car to the doors when I saw a group of teenagers hanging out at the outside tables to the right.



One of them was staring at me.



He had a smirk on his face. Not in the way a rowdy teenager would, this was different.



His lips were contorted, twisting upward on one side to reach lifeless eyes that were three times as tall as they should’ve been.



As I met his stare, his irises flared a sickly pale yellow, like dying embers. A low hum started to shake the inside of my skull, so sharp and cold.



I looked away, my heart pounding, as his eyes continued to fixate on me. A vignette had started around the edges of my perception, but faded soon after.



Soon after, I had everything loaded into my shopping cart and I was ready to go. At the checkout line, the cashier was scanning my items.



We were sharing some small talk, and I was just about to pay when I looked down and there was a large kitchen knife in my hand.



“You know, this is crazy, but you look a lot like the guy from that *Man of Steel* movie, I forget his name though…” She said to me.



I didn’t question where the knife had come from. Without a second thought, I snapped and drove the blade *into her neck.*



She stumbled backward and hopelessly clenched the giant gash that I put there. Eyes draining of life, she started panicking and flailing backward.



Screams erupted and people ran away as they noticed her gurgling and reaching towards them, hoping someone could save her from the nightmare that took her just now.



I slowly followed behind in anticipation as she collapsed to the floor. I stood over her like an aggressive menace while she stared into my eyes with a pleading look as her life was being snuffed out.



All she could get out was, *“Why?”* as blood pooled around her.



I said nothing. I just stood there and smiled.



And then—



—she was standing in front of me, holding out my receipt.



“Have a great day,” she told me.



Did I even respond to what she had said prior? I can’t recall.



She gave me an awkward smile. Probably because I just stood there looking like an idiot. The knife was gone.



I left the store and got back to my car, obsessively checking my hands for blood or any sharp objects.



I fumbled around my jacket pockets and found a note. It was from Zoey. It said “I love you!”



But the handwriting was too neat. Not the best, but a solid step up from a child’s writing.



I swear I saw this note earlier and it looked just like her normal handwriting.



I broke down in tears, my head hanging over the steering wheel. Tunnel vision began to set in again as I was sniffling and wiping the tears from my eyes. I blacked out.



I awoke in my car, in the same place. Fuck, I totally lost track of time. How long have I just been sitting here for?



I looked at the clock in my car. It was nearly time to go get Zoey from school.



The pickup line always gets packed when school gets out so I was definitely gonna be a few minutes late. Hope she wasn’t too upset about it.



When she was walking up to my car, I couldn’t tell if my disoriented eyes were playing tricks on me, but I couldn’t make out all the details of her face. As she got closer, I realized that was just an illusion my mind displayed.



She got in and did indeed look upset. I got her ice cream though, so we’re cool now.



The rest of the day went normal, nothing notable to speak of. Me and her were just watching more TV as I typed away on my laptop.



Later tonight, I was at the pub with my friend Danny, one of the friends from high school. I noticed Jennifer wasn't there. We'd still been talking, and things were still good with us.



One positive out of all the weird fucked up shit happening lately.



Danny and I were playing a game of pool on a Friday night; the place was packed. The typical pub that would turn into a party on weekend nights.



We were chatting about some new games we've been playing lately. I was telling him how many hours I stacked in the Oblivion remake.



The overhead lights flickered from the usual warm, cozy tint to a cool, bright one that resembled a holding cell.



I was about to take my shot with the pool cue when my concentration was broken. I noticed a group of friends drinking together at the end of the bar.



One was hunched over the bar, staring at me through his eyebrows with his head hunched under his shoulders and arms extending to the end of the bar.



His hands clenched the edge of the bartop. His mouth was gaped open while he did this.



The ambient noise of the bar, conversations, laughs, and glasses clinking all seemed to fade into obscurity as he controlled me with his stare.



I shuddered. Danny slapped my chest with the back of his hand. ""Yo, you payin' attention, bro?""



""Yeah… sorry, man,"" I responded.



We continued our conversation and game, and for a brief second, I glanced back at the guy. He was sitting upright with his beer and wasn't even paying attention to me.



He was so caught up with his buddies that there was no way he could've even noticed me.



""I've been pretty into the new Death Stranding game. I know the gameplay isn't for everybody, but I really enjoy the grind."" Danny said to me.



""Yeah, I mean more power to you, man, but it's not my thing. I do like the main actor from that game, though. Boondock Saints is one of my all-time favorite movies."" I said in return.



""You know, that's funny because you actually kinda *look* like that guy."" He said with a casual chuckle.



I shot a look at him so quickly that he probably would've thought I was pissed off for a second if I didn’t quickly regain my composure.



I didn't tell him how nobody close to me has been saying things like this, not like how everyone else was telling me. I was frustrated, but I hid it well.



I just said, ""Oh, that's crazy… I guess I never thought about that."" I quickly tried redirecting the conversation elsewhere. So, the night continued on.



Afterwards, we left the bar and went our separate ways.



I was driving home when I glanced in the rearview mirror. That same guy from the bar was in my backseat, slumped over again.



His gaping mouth stretched far beyond what I could see in the reflection. He was pointing at me.



The low hum returned in my head, followed by a voice that said, “It’s almost time.”



I was so petrified that I couldn’t even get a scream out. And just before I knew it, gone. Again.



Faint whispering came to me again, this time from the radio. I swear I never turned it on.

Here it goes: I (25 F) have been dating my boyfriend (27 M) for almost 5 years. We have lived together for the past 3 years. Our most recent fight happened around his birthday. I asked him what he wanted for a present and he said he wanted tickets to a concert and an ice cream cake. I then searched multiple places the day before his birthday for a cake. I went to 3 different places and finally found one. I unfortunately had to work on his birthday so we went out to dinner the day after. He already knew about the cake I bought him and that I bought candles and everything to make it special. On the way home after dinner he asked if we could stop to get ice cream I told him I got him that cake but he kept insisting we get ice cream instead. I decided to cave in and we stopped to get ice cream. I told him I was annoyed since I went searching for a cake and put a lot of effort in it. We then got into a huge fight when we got home. He then threw his ice cream across the room then picked up a pillow from the coach and threw that as well and broke one of my candles. He did throw either of them towards me but that candle shattered next to me. I then froze and left the room crying. He apologized and started cleaning up. After I gathered myself in the bathroom I told him to leave and he refused. Saying it was late and he had a few drinks at dinner and couldn’t drive to a hotel. He slept on the couch. The next day I didn’t even want to be around him so I left to clear my head by going on a hike and to a coffee shop. When I got home he asked if we could talk. He told me he would make changes snd doing better with his anger. Such as going to the gym to help with the stress and seeing a therapist. In the past 2 months he done neither. I feel like we just moved past it but I don’t feel like anything was resolved. 

It’s been months since that incident and everything seems to be going great. But a part of me feels like I’m just waiting for another outburst. He seems to always make these promises but doesn’t stick with them for more than a week or two. I don’t know what to do. I love him and want to be with him but I don’t know if I can move past these concerning situations. Please help.",6,1752730017.0,TwoHotTakes,6,1.0,False

1. Replace the default company with the Colonial company (tobacco, coffee, sugar), then give monopoly rights to all three. No need to add the industry charter on Tea because there are no tea plantations in the USA. The company will steal the cash crops from the aristocrats and turn them over to the capitalists.

2. DO NOT enact dedicated police. You might be tempted to transition from local police because it gives 25% political power, however, local police has a -5% militancy effect on the Pro-Slavery movement, which is very important in keeping them from triggering the civil war.

3. Make sure that more than 50% of your barracks and naval bases are in Dixie homelands. This means creating new armies (which you need for the manifest destiny anyway) in these states, and dismantling one of the navies so you can create another in Dixie. Having less than 50% of these in Dixie homelands provide a massive militancy increase for the Pro-Slavery movement

4. Bolster the Abolitionist movement and Suppress the Pro-Slavery, this will reduce their political power, but not militancy. However, it will help you enact Slavery Banned a lot faster

5. When you start, make sure to increase taxes to the highest level, this will almost ensures that the Whig party will win the upcoming elections. This will put the abolitionists into power, allowing you to start enacting Slavery Banned. BUT, make sure that the president is NOT abolitionist, because that will give 10% militancy. 

6. Once the whig party wins the elections, reduce the taxes to the lowest level. This will heighten support for the Whig party, and at the same time reduce radicals and increase loyalists - this is very important because radicals increase militancy, and loyalists reduce militancy of the Pro-Slavery movement

7. Typical tech opening for me is Nationalism -> Pharmaceuticals -> Quinine so I can trigger manifest destiny, oregon dispute, and alaska purchase really early. After Quinine I beeline the entire company tech tree. I focus on agricultural companies and Lee and Wilson. This will further reduce aristocratic power.

If you do these correctly, the revolution will hover between 90-97% while the law is being debated on. I tried this three times and succeeded every single time. I hate triggering the civil war because of the bugged (or at least badly designed) reconstruction process.

I'm dealing with it a lot better, I don't feel like I'm constantly on the verge of tears, the thought of going on a date with someone else  doesn't make me want to vomit (ok maybe still a little bit), but I still miss him

A few weeks ago I reached out after he wanted no contact (I know, I should respect no contact but he broke up with me and I was in a weak moment of missing him)

I told him I would be in his area and would like to catch up for a coffee to talk some things over. We broke up because he wanted kids and I didn't. When he dropped the news on me, his mind was already made up and didn't leave room for discussion which felt unfair because I don't think that it is such an open/shut conversation.

There's a lot reasons why I don't but it mainly boils down to how terrible my father was and how I didn't want to traumatise my own.

I have been doing a lot of reflecting, I could potentially have a child with him because I know he would actually step up and be a good dad, but needed to speak to him about it.

So I asked to catch up for coffee and chat, no pressure, but I just wanted to share my thoughts and discuss it with him because I feel like what we had/have is worth fighting for.

.... He left me on read. It confirms it's over and makes me wonder if there was another reason why we broke up. I even asked when we broke up and he said it was only the kid thing and he didn't want to ""waste my time"".

I'm struggling the most with just ending things, no contact, with someone who you spent all your time thinking about and wanting to be around. Losing my best friend, it's just so extremely heart breaking to go from all to nothing.

Can I have a perspective on why he wouldn't want to work through it, if I'm willing to consider the idea of having a kid, if that was the only reason he ended it ?",1,1752729906.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain.

 We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.
It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted. 
As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.
“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 
“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied
“It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 
“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 
“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My brother said he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”
“Okay, but your brother is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 
As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 
“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  
They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 
“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 
“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 
“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled
I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 
I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 
“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically
“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 
I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 
“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 
“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 
“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 
“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 
“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.
I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 



TWO.
That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after, we named it the MidwestGhostHunters. We have been on a dozen hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 
The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.
I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 



THREE.
I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.
“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 
“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded
“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 
“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 
“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously
“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 
I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 
“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.
I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 
Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 
Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.
“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 
“What's that?” I asked 
“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down in Oklahoma. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 
“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  
“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 
Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 
“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 



FOUR.
It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first “Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” 
I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 
I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 
Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 
“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked
“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”
“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 
Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 
“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 
“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked
As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 
“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan
“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 
Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.
The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 
“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 
“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded
“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked
“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated
“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 
“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said
“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated
I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video. Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend, there are so many terrifying stories about this place, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 
I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 
“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally
“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 
“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 
“Yes please” I said dejectedly 
To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 
The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 
I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.
Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 
We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 
I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 
“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”
“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 
“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated
“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 
“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 
When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 
Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 
“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied
“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 
Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 
“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room
“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 
“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room
“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”
Knock,Knock,Knock
He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 
I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 
I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 
“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 
I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 
Knock,Knock,Knock
“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 
“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said
“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.
 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 
“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked
We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 
I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence. In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.
We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  
Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.
“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 
“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”
We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.





FIVE
The high school appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.
Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 
“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 
“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated
Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.
“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 
“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly
“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked
We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  
I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 

We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 

We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 
We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”
Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”
Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 
“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 
“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 
Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 



SIX.
The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 
“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” 
They paused to look around, Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 
Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 
“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  
They just shrugged and continued exploring.  

As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 
“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered
“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 
We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.
 I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 
I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 
“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.
We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 
She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 
Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.
“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 
I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.
“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 
I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.
We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 

We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 
“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.
“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.
“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd
Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 
“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded
“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 
“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 

We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying “LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.” She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 
We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 



SEVEN.
It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 
Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 
His message made me curious so I agreed.
“Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 
Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?
“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”
Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 
I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.
I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 
Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 
“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 
Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.
There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 
I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 



EIGHT.
I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 
Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 
 	We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 
Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  
We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 

Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 
The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.
I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 
The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”
The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 



NINE.
By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 
She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 
Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  
That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now. 
Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon

We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 
So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you

I am very new to this and have been researching as much as I can. I currently used a pre-ground coffee as I do not have a grinder yet. Was looking for opinions on how much first pull came out?! I added some brown sugar and milk and it tasted good! I was only able to measure about 14g of grounds? It seemed like I could not get any more to fit into the portafilter at all. Would this mean I may need to get a finer ground? All and any feedback is appreciated!,5,1752729740.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

I'm using medium toasted coffee beans from Ethiopia and when i grind them below 30 I notice clean water leaking between the portafilter and the machine.

The Dedica struggles to extract the coffee and after doing some tests I thought I could have broken something. With the original pressurized filter and commercial coffee I don't notice any problems.

# Chapter 1: Penny

The studio lights buzz overhead, sharp and cold like everything else in this place. The mirrors lining the walls catch every flaw, every flicker of doubt, every step that lands even a half-second too late. I’m already sweating, the back of my neck damp, my hands clammy inside the pink satin of my pointe shoes.

I launch into the jeté and land wrong.

Not disastrously. But enough.

“Again,” Madame Loretto says, her voice as sharp as the tap of her cane against the floor.

I snap back into position. My heart is already hammering too fast. I feel every pair of eyes in the room shift toward me—subtle glances, sidelong smirks, the way you look when someone else is bleeding and you’re just glad it isn’t you.

I move again.

And miss again.

Not by much. A stutter in the landing. A fraction of a beat behind the music. A mistake no one would see—except Madame Loretto.

The piano cuts off with a sharp, discordant sound as she turns on her heel.

“Penelope Vale.” Her tone is exhausted. “Are you new here?”

I press my heels together, chin lifted, shoulders square. “No, Madame.”

“Are you injured?”

“No, Madame.”

“Then you must be lazy.” She clicks her tongue. “That’s disappointing.”

The silence stretches. My ears ring from the effort of keeping my breathing quiet.

“I’ve been teaching you for three years,” she says, pacing slowly in front of the mirrors, her reflection trailing behind her like a ghost. “Three years. You were what, sixteen when you came here? And now nineteen, still here, still lucky to be in this studio. You are the youngest girl in this class by a full four years. Do you understand how rare that is? How fortunate you are to even be dancing in this room?”

“Yes, Madame.”

“Then why are you wasting it?” Her voice lifts, not in volume, but in sharpness. “You’ve been dancing since you were two. Seventeen years of training and you still land like you don’t understand gravity. The Spring Gala trials are next week, and you’re dancing like you’ve already lost.”

My throat is tight. My spine feels like it might snap from how hard I’m holding myself up.

“You want the solo?” she says. “Then act like someone who deserves it. Otherwise, I’ll give it to someone with half your talent and twice your discipline.”

A long silence. She turns to the pianist.

“Take five minutes. Everyone. Penelope, sit.”

I drop to the floor, pressing my palms to the cool marley to hide the way they shake.

Mila is beside me a second later, her knees bent up to her chest, her voice soft. “Okay, what was that?”

I don’t look at her. Just stare straight ahead at the mirror, where my face looks too pale and too tight.

“You don’t mess that up,” she says. “Ever. You literally did it in your sleep at that overnight lock-in last fall. What’s going on?”

I exhale. Slow. Controlled. “Ty forgot to pick me up after class.”

She blinks. “Tyler?”

I nod. “I waited for like twenty minutes, but he was helping some girl study and forgot. I had to run six blocks and changed in the hallway just to get here on time.”

Mila’s mouth twists. “That’s, what, the fourth time?”

“Fifth.”

She doesn’t say dump him, but it’s written all over her face.

“He said he was sorry,” I add, even though I don’t really know why. “He just... spaced.”

“Spaced?” Mila says. “During your Gala trial week?”

I shake my head, pulling my knees to my chest. “It’s fine. I’m just off. I’ll fix it.”

She doesn’t say anything for a second, then bumps her shoulder into mine. “You’d better. Amanda’s already mentally rehearsing her acceptance speech.”

I groan, laughing under my breath.

But the tightness in my chest doesn’t fade.

When Madame Loretto steps back into the studio, she doesn’t even look at me. Just says, “From the top.”

I stand.

I turn to face the mirror again, and for a moment, I just breathe. I look at myself—the hard lines of my cheekbones, the tension in my jaw, the muscle twitching beneath the pale fabric of my leotard.

I know this dance. I’ve lived in it.

This is mine.

The music starts.

I move.

Everything fades away—the class, the ache in my back, the sting of Madame’s words. My legs extend cleanly, arms carving through the air like water. My spine is long, core locked tight, fingers soft and alive. I feel the flow of the music in every inch of me.

I turn. I land. I breathe through it.

Jeté. Pirouette. Relevé.

Perfect.

My shadow stretches beside me in the mirror, precise and sharp, but I don’t look at her. I’m in the movement. I’m not hoping it’s right—I know it is. Every count. Every flick of my wrist. My face remains still, unreadable. But inside, I am blazing.

The final movement sweeps me to center, a slow, deliberate drop from arabesque into the last position. I stop, balanced. Poised. Weightless.

I exhale.

And then… silence.

Madame Loretto stands at the edge of the room, unreadable.

I wait for something—criticism, a correction, even more silence.

Instead, she gives one, single, tight nod.

That’s it.

No applause. No compliment. But I feel it like thunder.

My chest blooms with heat, and a grin breaks across my face before I can stop it.

That nod means I did it. That nod means it was enough.

I sit down again, slower this time, the adrenaline still pulsing through my limbs.

Mila grins at me. “Okay. That was scary good.”

“Yeah?” I say, pretending to drink water, even though my hands are shaking a little.

“You looked like a different person. Like… someone out of a movie. You crushed it.”

I smile wider. “I know.”

It’s not arrogance. It’s not even relief.

It’s something quieter.

Something earned.

For a few seconds, I’m not thinking about Tyler or being nineteen or how hard I had to run to get here. I’m just thinking about that last note of music, and how I hit it with my whole body still humming.

I don’t need the praise.

I don’t need the applause.

I just need the dance. Chapter 2: Penny

The first breath outside the studio always feels like a small kind of freedom. The air’s warmer than it’s been in months, the sharpness of winter finally fading into something that smells like dirt and early grass. I roll my shoulders as I walk, wincing when the right one catches. Too many hours under Madame Loretto’s glare.

Mila falls in beside me, pulling her sweatshirt tighter around her waist. “I don’t know about you,” she says, “but I feel like I just got hit by a truck made of ballet shoes.”

I huff a laugh. “You and me both.”

“My quads are actively planning their escape.”

“My soul already left my body in the second round of adagios.”

Mila groans. “I’m glad I’m not trying for the Spring Gala. I’d actually have to care.”

I glance over at her. “I still don’t get it. You should try out.”

She gives me a look—dry, unbothered. “Did you see me today? I almost wiped out during barre. And I wasn’t even moving.”

“You weren’t that bad.”

“I was. It’s okay. I’ve made peace with being average.”

I slow my pace a little, adjusting my bag strap. “You’re not average. You’re solid. You just don’t push yourself.”

“I know,” she says, not offended. “That’s why it works. No pressure, no breakdowns.”

I massage my shoulder again, letting the silence settle between us for a second.

Mila glances at me. “You, though. Even when you were messing up earlier? You were still better than the rest of us.”

I shake my head. “That’s generous.”

“It’s not. You just—move differently. You make the floor look like it belongs to you.”

I don’t know what to say to that. Compliments always land strange. Too soft. Like I don’t know what to do with them once they’re in my hands.

I shrug. “Madame didn’t think so.”

“She did by the end.”

“Only after emotionally dismantling me in front of the entire room.”

Mila tilts her head, thoughtful. “She’s rough. But she only does that with people she thinks might actually have a shot.”

I glance up at the sky. It’s that pale, late-afternoon shade of blue, still cool at the edges. The sidewalks are patchy with melted snow and uneven sunshine, but it smells like spring is fighting its way in. Everything’s still ugly—but softer. Lighter.

We stop at the curb. The walk sign blinks red.

“I was off today,” I say, quietly. “I could feel it.”

“Because of Tyler?”

I pause. “Yeah.”

“You want to talk about it?”

“He forgot to pick me up. Again. After class.”

She exhales, long and slow. “Did he apologize?”

“Said he was helping someone study.”

Mila raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything.

“It’s not like I expect him to rearrange his life,” I add, even though I don’t owe her an explanation.

“No,” she says. “But maybe remembering yours would be nice.”

We cross the street. I don’t look at her.

“He means well,” I say after a moment. “He’s just... scattered.”

“He’s not in the room with you when you’re bleeding into your shoes, Pen. He doesn’t know what it takes.”

“I don’t need him to understand ballet.”

“I know. But maybe you need him to understand you.”

I don’t answer. The silence stretches out again as we walk past the coffee shop and the florist whose windows are still full of fake snow. I exhale, slow and steady, trying to shake off the weight pressing behind my ribs.

“I nailed it, though,” I say eventually.

Mila looks over. “You did.”

“That last run-through felt... right. For the first time in a while.”

“I could tell. You looked like yourself again.”

The corner bakery is just ahead, and Mila points toward it. “Come on. We earned something soft and full of carbs.”

The smell hits us before the door opens—vanilla, sugar, butter. Warmth.

We order without thinking. She gets her usual cinnamon roll. I grab the chocolate cupcake with the thick frosting swirl. It looks ridiculous. I want it anyway.

We sit by the window, quiet again. People move past outside—rushed, distracted, loud. It’s all so far away in here.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” I say finally, low enough that only Mila can hear.

She doesn’t flinch. “You’re not broken.”

“I just feel... like I’m trying to stay on top of something that keeps shifting under my feet.”

“You’re exhausted.”

“Everyone’s exhausted.”

“Yeah,” she says. “But not everyone’s trying to carry the weight of perfection at the same time.”

I break off a piece of cupcake and roll it between my fingers. “I feel like if I let it go for even a second, I’ll fall behind.”

“You won’t.”

“How do you know?”

She looks at me like it’s obvious. “Because you’re already ahead.”

That silences me for a minute.

We finish our pastries slowly. There’s no rush. Just soreness and sugar and the strange relief of having survived another class, another day.

When we finally head back out, the sun’s dipped lower, the gold turning cooler, but it still feels warmer than it has in weeks. I breathe it in like something earned.

My body aches in every direction. My shoulder throbs. My thighs are already threatening tomorrow’s pain. But I walk steady.

Today, I landed it.

And maybe that’s enough.

Mila splits off toward her block with a sleepy wave, muttering something about ramen and a bath and how if she doesn’t text me later, I should assume she’s been swallowed whole by her mattress. I smile as I keep walking.

I pull out my phone for the first time since before class and instantly get hit with a flood of notifications.

Twelve texts from Tyler.

**Ty (4:52 PM):** I’m so sorry

**Ty (4:54 PM):** I literally suck

**Ty (4:55 PM):** I completely spaced—Zoe needed help with some chem thing and it just

**Ty (4:55 PM):** Happened

**Ty (5:00 PM):** I’m an idiot

**Ty (5:03 PM):** Please let me make it up to you

**Ty (5:04 PM):** You’re probably in class now

**Ty (5:08 PM):** I swear I’ll never forget again

**Ty (5:09 PM):** Please don’t hate me

**Ty (5:15 PM):** I love you

**Ty (5:15 PM):** So much

I stop walking. My heart does this stupid soft flip in my chest, and I press my fingers lightly to the screen. He forgot. Yeah. But he cares. He always does. Even when he messes up.

Tyler’s never been perfect, but he’s never made me feel anything less than loved.

And honestly? I don't care that I had to run today. I’d still take this over anyone else.

When I turn the corner onto my street, I freeze.

He’s sitting on the porch.

My porch.

His hoodie is pulled low over his eyes, and there’s a paper bag in his lap. He’s scrolling through his phone, probably checking for the hundredth time if I’ve texted back yet.

I smile before I can stop myself.

“Hey,” I say.

His head jerks up fast, and he practically jumps to his feet. “Pen.”

He rushes toward me, holding the bag in one hand, his face wrecked with apology. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to—I got caught up helping Zoe and totally lost track and then when I looked at the time I—God, I felt sick.”

“Ty—”

“I should’ve been there. I had it on my calendar. I even set a reminder and then ignored it like a complete idiot—”

I laugh and wrap my arms around his waist, hugging him tight. “Ty. It’s okay.”

He pulls back just enough to look at me. “Are you sure?”

“Yeah. It’s okay. You’re here now.”

He holds out the bag. “I got you that sandwich you like. The weird healthy one? With the avocado and... sprouts or whatever?”

I peek inside. It’s definitely not the one I would’ve picked, but he remembered I liked it once, a long time ago. It’s sweet. It’s him.

“This is perfect,” I say.

He exhales like I just handed him a second chance, then kisses me—quick, soft, familiar.

“Text me when you wake up?” he says.

“Of course.”

He squeezes my hand once before heading down the steps. I watch him walk down the street and into his house—just three doors down from mine.

I hold the sandwich to my chest and grin.

Because I love him.

Earlier this year, I found out that I had pretty much all of the prolapses, my bladder, uterus, vaginal walls, rectum, intussusception, you name it, I had it. This meant major surgery and I followed my doctor's recommendation to have a total hysterectomy. But no matter how sure I was with my decision medically, I felt a tremendous amount of grief and sorrow that I would lose my uterus. 

I am an SA victim and it has taken me a long time to come to love my body and all parts of it. I just couldn't get over the idea that surgeons would remove my uterus and then dispose of it as trash. I don't want any part of my body being treated as waste and be tossed aside. So I decided to advocate for myself and request that all tissue that is removed will be returned to me after pathology has done their tests.

It took a lot of research to figure out how to process my uterus and I thank the awesome people in the /askamortician and /askfuneraldirectors who helped me think this through. My idea was to turn it into plant fertilizer and that's exactly what I did. In short, I used a food dehydrator and a coffee grinder to do this. It was weird, it was hard, it was healing, it was a lot of things. 

I wrote a little report on it (with pictures so beware) in case anyone else feels like this is something they'd like to pursue. For me, it helped to come to terms with it all. If you would like the report, write me a chat message with your email address and I will try to mail it to you.

**🚮 Republic Services Strike Affects Renton Residents**  
A strike by Republic Services workers has caused garbage to accumulate across Renton, Kent, Bellevue, Covington, Sammamish, and other cities leading to overflowing dumpsters, frustration and concerns. Republic Services is prioritizing some locations (businesses/multifamily areas?) and plans double pickups once service resumes. It is unknown when servic will resume or when the strike will end as this has become a national issue. An email about the next negotiation date has some people speculating that the strike will last at least until July 30 but we cannot be certain of anything.

**🚨 No Felony Charges for Men Who Shot at Renton Transit Center**  
Prosecutors declined felony charges against two men who shot a man attacking their group with a PVC pipe at Renton Transit Center, citing self-defense after reviewing video evidence. Renton Police disagree with the decision, arguing the shooting was excessive, but prosecutors maintain the burden to disprove self-defense wasn’t met.

1m1yyii,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1m1yyii/struggling_to_break_into_sydneys_finance_job/,Struggling to break into Sydney's finance job market — would appreciate any honest advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently based in Sydney and have been actively job hunting over the past few months. Despite my experience, I’ve found it surprisingly challenging to land interviews, especially in front-office finance roles — so I’m turning to this community to seek some honest insights and advice.

Here’s a bit about me:
- 6+ years of experience in finance, including roles at UBS and a Hong Kong-based asset management firm
- Focused on investment banking, capital markets, and client-facing investment roles across Asia-Pacific
- Currently completed my MBA at UNSW (AGSM), with exchanges at Oxford (Said) and Kellogg (Northwestern)
- Two master degrees in data science and business from top universities 
- Fully work-authorized in Australia (PR holder), fluent in English and Mandarin

I’ve been applying to roles in investment banking, institutional sales, and asset management — tailoring my applications and networking actively — but with limited results so far. I’m wondering:
- Is local experience more critical than I thought?
- Are front-office finance roles in Sydney mostly filled through internal networks?
- Is there something in my background or approach that may be holding me back?


Would truly appreciate any feedback, even if it’s blunt. And if anyone in the finance community is open to a casual coffee chat, I’d love to connect and learn more about the local landscape. Feel free to DM me — I’m all ears and genuinely looking to improve.

Thanks in advance!",0,1752729124.0,AskAnAustralian,8,0.5,False

Years later, I got a message on Yahoo Messenger…","It took us 12 years to write it - and alot of pain to recall it all but we did it. Here is the Prologue: 

Prologue: The Ping

He hadn’t touched Yahoo Messenger in well over a year.

His laptop screen glowed in the dark room, casting pale light across the carpet and the half-empty coffee cup on the floor beside him.

Shawn had logged in out of an old habit more than anything - just checking, maybe looking for an old message from someone long gone.

Then it happened.

hello

Just one word. A new message. No context.

He stared at it, confused. The screen name wasn’t unfamiliar… but it wasn’t possible.

nahrain\_dreams2003

His chest tightened.

No. It couldn’t be. Some scammer maybe? Or a cruel joke. Someone using her handle.

He typed quickly, fingers hitting the keys harder than necessary.

shawn.taylor\_82: Who is this?

shawn.taylor\_82: This account belonged to someone who died. Who do you think you are, using it?

He stood up, pacing.

Anger flared in his chest - sharp and familiar.

Just like the day they told him she was gone.

Her vehicle had been hit. Ambushed outside the wire. Right after his unit rotated out.

No survivors.

That’s what they said.

But first - they took his M16. They asked him to hand it over, calm-like. He hadn’t even known why yet.

“We just need to hold onto this for a while, Sergeant Taylor.”

They didn’t want him doing something stupid.

Didn’t want him grabbing gear and storming out for revenge.

Gave him time to get his head straight - time he never asked for.

The fury that rose then - it hadn’t left. He’d just buried it under years of silence.

His hands shook.

nahrain\_dreams2003: Taylor… wait. Please. Just listen.

Taylor. No one else ever called him that.

He froze, mid-step.

shawn.taylor\_82: Stop this. This isn’t funny.

nahrain\_dreams2003: It’s really me. Open the camera. Just… open it.

He hesitated.

His heart thudded in his ears.

Open the camera?

He moved his cursor – hovering just over the icon.

Every part of him said not to. It couldn’t be.

He’d buried her. In his mind. In his past.

In the part of him that never really came home.

But his fingers moved anyway.

Click.

The camera flickered to life.

And there she was.

Alive.

Not a dream. Not a ghost.

Just Nahrain.

Older. Damaged.

A curtain of dark hair swept across one side of her face - hiding what the war had taken.

One eye full of tears. The other… gone.

Breathing. Real.

“Hey, Taylor,” she said softly.

He sat down hard, unable to speak.

The room tilted, and all the years between that moment and the last time he saw her collapsed into nothing.

Tears flowed down their faces.

Neither one could talk for a moment - their emotions too high, too raw, too real.

The silence between them said everything.

They were both still here. Somehow.

**Chapter One:** 

	Silence. All that could be heard in the town of Burbank was silence. Street lights flickered on and off as they struggled for power, and bugs scuttled along the cold concrete of the streets. Old houses lined the streets, and old automobiles sat amongst them, slowly succumbing to their age. The age of the ‘Old World’ had passed a long time ago, and since then some places had been forgotten and left to rot. The commodities of the ‘New World’ were foreign within them, almost futuristic. 

Some stayed here because of the expenses of the new towns, others wanted to keep a simple living. Some saw the new technology as strange and wrong to them. One of those people now sat in his home resting after a long day's work. The man, Rocko, had lived in this town since he was born. He lived in it even with the innovation of new technology and the ‘New World’ existing. He remembered how his preacher had deemed them ungodly and sent straight from the devil just because the technology was so advanced and strange to them it seemed like witchcraft.

The night was still silent as Rocko slept in his old and worn down home in his old and worn down bed, in his old and worn down room where the wall paper was ripped and slowly peeling. His dreams filled with visions of a raise and a new position at his office job, only to have them dissolve into nothingness upon the sound of shattering glass downstairs. He shot up and looked around the dark. He sat there for a second processing what just happened before he threw his legs over his bed and hopped off it.

He ran to his bed-side table and opened the drawer, grabbing a small handgun he kept with him while he slept. He loaded it and slowly descended down his old and worn down staircase, flipping the light switch as he did. Each step creaked and it made him wince a little, as whoever it was down here could hear him approaching. After the longest descent Rocko ever had on a staircase, he reached his kitchen and living room. He looked around the dark and reached for the light switch near the entrance to the staircase.

The lights flicked on. He looked around, searching for where the noise came from, first his living room. In it was his old reclining chair sat next to a small end table with an ash tray and lamp on it. An old record player sat collecting dust on an even older looking end table and the floor beneath his feet was a rugged and stained shag carpet. Next he checked the kitchen.

In it he saw the window next to his backdoor had been shattered completely, and the tile around it was littered with glass shards of all sizes. He kneeled down to look at the damage, not seeing the figure approaching him from under his counter. Rocko stood up only to have himself kicked in the back, and sent forward into the glass, knocking his gun from his hands, and landing face first. He screamed in agony and rolled over injecting more of the shards into his arms and back. He looked at the man in front of him. His hands were wrapped around a shotgun, and a large dark trench coat covered most of his body. His face wasn’t any different, with a large hat sat upon his head and cloaked it in shadow.

He aimed the shotgun at Rocko and slowly got closer to him till the barrel was pressed up against his skull. Rocko winced, his eyes shutting tight as he clenched his teeth in fear.

“Tyler Rocko Vincant?” the man said. Rocko nodded, his teeth still clenched.

“Harvester for Mercury?” Rocko nodded again and tears started to pour from his eyes as he mouthed the word, “Yes.” The man was silent for a moment and Rocko could feel his heart beating a hundred miles an hour.

“You’ve been found to have taken some of our supply for yourself to sell to a third party. How do you plead to such an accusation?” He kept the gun at Rocko’s head and Rocko couldn’t help but choke back a sob before speaking.

“I-I had to man my bills, they-they needed to be paid some-somehow.” 

The man then slowly took the muzzle away from Rocko’s head, and as Rocko sat up a bit the man asked, “Do you plead guilty?”

Rocko looked at the man and said, “Yes,” There wasn’t any way he could lie now, if Mercury already sent an interrogator then he was already caught. The man looked at Rocko once again and turned the rifle backwards, then slammed the butt of the shotgun into his skull, knocking him unconscious. The man, or interrogator as his profession was called, grabbed Rocko’s hand and dragged him out of the glass, and toward the front door. 

He slammed his foot into the door and knocked it from its hinges onto the front lawn. He walked down the street, the flickering lights illuminating him as he went, before finally reaching his car. He threw Rocko in the trunk, locked it, and threw his shotgun in the passenger seat in the back. Then he shut the driver side door, turned the key, and turned the car to drive before setting off into the night with Rocko in toe.

\* 	\* 	\*

The night air was cold in detective Marsh’s office. It was located in a large and dilapidated apartment building in Burbank, and it just so happened to be where he lived as well. The old windowed wooden door may have been closed but the cracks in the walls and beneath it were still there to chill Marsh to the bone. He laid in his old cot and pulled his sheets over him for some bit of extra warmth in the night. Right in front of the cot’s side was his old wood desk, his chair, and wastebasket. 

He couldn’t even afford any appliances, the only ones he had were a small rusted stove that sat in the corner and his toilet, things that came with the apartment. Marsh could finally feel sleep falling over him when his phone rang. He groaned in frustration and slowly crawled out of his cot to his desk. He pulled out his chair, sat down, and picked up the phone.

“Hello?” He yawned as he spoke.

“Good evening Mr. Marsh, would this be a bad time?”

“No, no it’s not, what can I help you with?”

“We just got a call about a local disturbance that happened a couple of minutes ago, we’d like you to come down to take a look with the department.”

“Sure thing, I’ll be down there in a few minutes, tell officer Collin to wait on me, always been a jackrabbit that man.”

“Will do.” Then the call came to a stop and Marsh put the phone back. He walked to his bathroom where a non-functioning shower now sat as his closet. He pulled a button up shirt off it, some long black work pants, and a tie. He walked out of the bathroom, went to the coat rack, pulled his trench coat off it and slid it on.

Then he grabbed his hat and plopped it on his head, then almost walked out the door before realizing he forgot his revolver and went to grab it and the holster from his desk drawer. Then he actually walked out the door and locked it behind him. He made his way to the old lift in the old dusty hallway and called for it. It took about a minute for it to come up and as he stepped into the old rusted box, he watched the grated metal doors shut, and his floor disappear.

He got out at the bottom floor and walked out into the cold night air toward the station a few blocks down the street. He could hear his footsteps echo off the concrete in the dim light, the faint buzzing of the flickering street lights. The station was a large building that seemed to be better maintained than any other place in Burbank. Its paint job was chipped only a bit and large parts of the building weren’t missing. Marsh walked till he made it over to where a police car was sitting and hopped into it. He slid into the back and found officer Collin in the front alongside another officer he didn’t know very well.

He thought Hill was his name, or maybe it was Ford. He might’ve been new. He couldn’t remember in his tired state.

“‘Bout time you got here, I was about to floor it out of here.” Collin looked in the back at Marsh.

“Always eager I see,” Marsh said.

“Hey, ya never know when you’ll get a call. Maybe you need to take some notes Marsh.”

“Hard when you forget your notepad and sleep on a cot.”

“They're still not paying ya well are they?” A bit of sympathy crept into Collin’s voice.

“Not really, but hey maybe this time they will.” Collin sighed a bit and turned the car to drive. Soon enough they were off into the night. All the while Hill or Vincent or what’s his face stayed quiet, staring off into space. Marsh started to doze off, his eyes growing heavy, and his vision splotches of obscuring ink meant to put him to sleep. It wasn’t until about twenty minutes of driving Marsh felt the car jerk to a stop. He felt his head hit the seat in front of him and he cursed a bit under his breath. He looked out the window at where they were. There was an old dilapidated house where a couple other police cars sat and the front door was knocked down onto the front lawn. He could see the lights on through the cracked and smudged windows and shadows walking about inside.

“Not too different from our usual forte,” Collin said. He switched the car off and got out of the car with what's his face and Marsh in toe. He could already see an officer searching the lawn.

Marsh watched as he passed the broken down door, seeing the imprint of a boot print spread out across its surface, and small cracks. What’s his face nudged Collin and glanced over at it to show him. He stopped and looked, nodding a bit as he did. As Marsh cleared the door’s threshold he looked around the house’s interior. On his left was what looked like a living room, in the middle sat a staircase, and on the right sat a kitchen where a couple officers sat looking at a pile on the floor with an object next to it. 

Collin led them over to the group, “So, what's it looking like?” It took a bit for Marsh to realize the floor was covered in glass and bits of blood, and a handgun an officer was putting in a bag with gloves.

“Uh, a break in by the looks of it Collin, and a struggle.” one of the officers said.

“I see, the source of the glass is from that shattered window I’d presume.”

“What's it look like?” Another officer said in a snarky manner. Collin brushed off the jab and looked over toward the entrance again.

“Have you sent anybody up to check the upstairs yet?” He asked.

“A couple guys, you and Hill should look up there,” Then the officer looked at Marsh.

“You know your job.” He said. Marsh watched as Collin and Hill made their way up the stairs, and turned to walk back to the open front door. He walked onto the front lawn past the broken down door, then past the lawn onto the sidewalk and toward the house next door. He looked around the dark street, only seeing the flickering street lights, the old cars of years past, telephone poles and power lines that were leaning or sat straight up, and the decayed town around him, one from an age before his time. An age he didn’t know.

He walked up to the closest house nearby. Its lawn was filled with yellowing grass, and two flower beds where everything had died out. Before the door was a porch where old lawn furniture sat, seemingly unused. Marsh walked down the sidewalk to the door and made his way up onto the old porch, his footsteps making the wood creak and squeak like a rodent. He took a second to adjust his tie and the hat on his head before he knocked on the old door in front of him. No one answered for a second, then Marsh saw lights turn on in the fogged and smudged windows of the house and could hear the muttering of someone. Then the door knob moved as the door swung open.

Before Marsh was an old man in a bluish colored bathrobe with a pair of slippers slid across his feet. Any hair left on his scalp was in strips that poked out on the sides of his head. He also perpetually had a frown etched across his old wrinkled face as if it were carved there by someone.

“What is it damn it, can’t you see I was trying to sleep?” His voice was shrill and cold.

“Sir, I’m here to ask you if you happen to know anything about your neighbor.” Marsh said.

“The one making that racket earlier?”

“Yes, one of your other neighbors reported the sounds of a break in,” The old man's expression didn’t seem to change a bit.

“And you're asking me, why not the person who reported it?” Marsh felt a bit of embarrassment as he realized the old man was right but tried to play it off as intentional. 

“Well, I figured you’d happen to know something about him since you were his neighbor.” The old man somehow seemed to give Marsh an even harsher look by squinting his eyes tight and contorting his mouth to frown more.

“Look, all I know about that kid next door is that he’s into some bad stuff and that his name is Rocko. Now, if you’d excuse me I’m going back to bed!” He then slammed the door in Marsh’s face.

“Old bastard.” Marsh cursed under his breath. However, Marsh was able to pick up one thing besides the kids name. He was into ‘bad stuff’ as the old man put it. That could mean a lot of things but that was something at least. But he needed more than that at least, and someone who'd actually speak with him instead of an old grouch. He made his way back down the sidewalk that led to the porch and walked down the street, passed Rocko’s house, and toward his other neighbor, the one who most likely called, at least he hoped so he could save himself from more embarrassment.

The house next to Rocko’s was an equally old and torn up house. Its paint was a now fading blue with round shingles that looked like they were made of a now scorched wood. Through the smudged windows Marsh could see the lights were on in the house. As he made his way through the front yard, he walked up a set of stone steps; there wasn’t a porch like the last house. He knocked on the old door, its surface cold and hard like iron and heard quick footsteps as if the person knew they were gonna have someone show up. The footsteps came to the door and opened it for Marsh, revealing an older looking woman.

“Excuse me ma’am, I’d like to ask you a couple questions about your neighbor,”

“Is this over the break in?” she asked.

“Not just that ma’am it appears he’s gone missing from his home as well.”

She was silent for a long moment before opening the door wider to allow Marsh into the house, and as he walked in he noticed a fireplace and photos of people who seemed to be her grandkids. There were plush and old chairs that seemed to look at the fireplace.

“Please take a seat, I’ll fix you some coffee sir,”

“You don’t have to do that ma’am, I drink too much anyways.” That last bit was muttered under his breath. The old woman nodded and walked over to the plush chairs with Marsh and sat down. There was an awkward silence for a moment before Marsh broke it with his first of many questions.

“I suppose you were the one who called about a break in at your neighbor's house, yes?”

“Yes, I could hear screaming shattering glass, and before I knew it I heard a loud slam.” She made a fist with her hand and smacked her open hand to show what she meant.

“What's your neighbor's name ma’am?”

“Rocko that's what he liked to be called, I think his real name might’ve been Tony…no, Tyler that was it, barely mentioned his real name. He's quite a boy let me tell you, really sweet when you get to know ‘em.”

“I was told by one of your other neighbors that he was into ‘bad stuff’ would you agree with that?”

The old woman went silent, and twiddled her thumbs a bit before speaking, “From what I know about him he’s always been around a bad crowd. Drug dealers, criminals, those sorts of people.”

“Has he ever harmed you?”

“Oh, never, he’s always been quiet, I always chat with him in the morning over a cup of coffee before he goes to work. He’s a good kid at heart, I just think people get a bad impression of him.”

“I see, would you happen to have any contact with his family by chance?”

“I’m afraid not, I only knew him, not anyone related to him. From what he’s told me he hasn’t had a good relationship with them recently.”

“It's because of his criminal activity and association with criminals, yes?”

The old woman sighed, “Yes, I wish he could live better, really I tried to convince him to leave it. He just gave me a sad look and told me he couldn’t.” Marsh shook his head a slight bit out of sadness for the kid.

“It’s a bad place, the criminal underworld, it's a place of deception, bloodshed, drugs, and weapons dealing. Maybe he couldn’t or else he’d get…” Marsh stopped and put his finger across his neck and made a slicing motion to which the old woman nodded, and Marsh thought he could see her eyes filling with tears.

She sniffled a bit and rubbed her eyes. She asked with a shaky voice, “Do you think they came for him?” Marsh was silent for a long time. He met the old woman's eyes and saw the sorrow in her eyes.

“They might have, they very well might have.” With that Marsh got up from the chair he was sitting in. “Ma’am if I could have the number for your home phone, just so I can stay in contact with you.” She nodded and choked back a sob as she went to another room of the house before returning with a piece of paper with her number written on it.

“I’ll try to update you on anything I find ma’am, I promise.” Marsh gave her a reassuring glance as he walked toward the front door. She didn’t seem to look as she seemed to stumble her way back to her chair and put her head in her hands and cried. Marsh closed the door as he left and looked at the number on the paper. He could only hope Rocko was still alive.",1,1752729106.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Ever wonder why your leftover spaghetti tastes different after microwaving? IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE EATING FOOD FROM ANOTHER TIME DIMENSION!  
  
I cracked the code last weekend when I heated up Mom's pasta and suddenly my socks felt like they'd been sunbathing in July. The spinning plate isn't just reheating your food - it's creating a TIME VORTEX that transports your snacks through the space-time continuum!  
  
🔥 PROOF THAT MICROWAVES ARE TIME MACHINES:  
\- That grumpy wizard humming sound (especially loud on Saturdays)  
\- Dogs barking at fridges (they can sense the future escaping!)  
\- Leftover pizza that tastes like last week's party  
\- The mysterious warmth that spreads beyond just your food  
  
⚡ HOW TO OPERATE YOUR MICROWAVE TIME MACHINE:  
✅ Use leftover pizza as your secret key to unlock time travel  
✅ NEVER put bananas in (unless you want pure chaos)  
✅ Always stand back when it dings - that's the timeline snapping back to reality  
  
The timer isn't just counting down seconds... it's the actual HEARTBEAT of the time vortex! And that final beep? That's when your future snack teleports directly into our present timeline.  
  
Grownups will try to tell you it ""just heats up food"" but we know the REAL truth. Why settle for boring reheated dinner when you could be eating a meal that's traveled through time itself?

Lately, I’ve been really worried that she’s dealing with insomnia. I don’t think she’d ever call it that herself, she escaped Somalia during the civil war in the 90s to America so she always downplayed and ridiculed people with mental issues but I can see the signs.

Ever since she stopped working and became a full time housewife now that my dad was promoted with his job.She’s often up really late — I’ll go to bed and she’ll still be awake, sometimes just lying there in the dark or quietly moving around the house. Then she’s up again really early, like 4 or 5 a.m reading her books and never goes back to sleep. It feels like she’s never getting proper rest.

During the day, she looks so tired — I can see it in her face and how she moves. She seems more forgetful, more irritable, and sometimes just… emotionally distant, like she’s not all there. She drinks tea and coffee on the phone in the kitchen cooking food alone or in the garden with her cat all afternoon trying to stay awake and she used to always stay indoors and avoid too much sunlight growing up so it’s very unusual to see her there out in the porch every day

It hurts seeing her like this. She’s done everything for me my whole life, and now that I’m older in college. I want to support her too. But I don’t know how to bring it up without making her feel like I’m overstepping. I don’t want her to feel embarrassed or like I’m pointing fingers — I just want her to feel better, to rest, to feel like herself again.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, either as a parent or as someone trying to help one — I’d really appreciate your advice.  Any suggestions to help her sleep better?

    Prolog
As Cloe lies alone in the pitch black darkness, pondering how the heck they got this beat up old volkswagen van in this gymnasium she was straddled underneath. She was supposed to be a zombie, the living dead, trying to get unsuspecting passerby to become her next meal. 
 Cloe saw a shadow behind the black out curtains that was behind the van. She supposed it was the two want to be scary clowns that was roaming around the place trying to frighten guests in line awaiting their demise. 
 But it wasn't. It was a much more tall slender figure that stood behind the curtain then vanished as soon as she turned her head to look at it.
She got up off of the rug she was laying on from under the van to investigate. 
As she headed towards the back to the curtain where her shadow friend was, she heard a noise. Then saw a blurry face. As it got closer she recognized it. 
Aaron!! He made it. She had asked him to come, that they would have fun scaring people but she didn't know if he could get off work in time. He just got a job as a farm hand and they were keeping him busy. Which she guessed was a good thing. He had to provide for his daughter that he just got full custody of. 
She hugged him and noticed he was in his black graduation gown. She guessed he was going for a grim rapper vibe. Cloe point towards the makeup and dress up area in the back of the gymnasium to go find a scarey mask if he wanted one. She didn't want him to go and wanted him to spook with me in my area but she wanted him to have fun, she let him go on his way but not before she thanked him for coming and gave him a long kiss. We were just about to get to the I love you stage in our relationship. He hadn't said it yet but she felt it in the way he held her when we kissed. 
Cloe was significantly shorter than him so she had to stand on my tip toes to kiss him, which he thought was cute. We were perfect together. We were kind of high school sweet hearts want to bes.
 Although he had his girlfriend who he had his daughter with and I had my boyfriend. We had a class together and slacked off and just hung out together. We got to be best friends and there was a little flirting. 
He left going toward the area I pointed out but not before giving me one last smooch before. After he left she went back under the van to resume my position. 


                          Chapter 1
Cloe has been waiting for her junior year to go to a co op class. Her school partnered with a bigger school to offered to take elective classes for juniors that did not offer in our high school. They offered CNA classes, early childhood classes, mechanical classes. She wanted to take their graphic arts class. 
We would have a school bus take us from our school to the bigger school, a city school at 1:30 in the afternoon and have them drop us back off when the school day was over. 
First day of junior year my classes were boring in the anticipation for my 6th period to get over. Finally the time came and she went to my locker to gather all her things because the school would be locked up by the time we came back. She had all her books and paper she would need to do tonights homework then she was headed towards the door when she bumped into her math teacher Mrs. Neamore.
 She wanted to talk to her about the entry exam that we have to take to see what we remembered from the last year. She bombed it and she knew it. Mrs. Neamore wanted her to come back to her class room to discuss it. She knew she was going to get the"" i know you could do better"" speech but she saw the bus already out there and said she had class and she needed to go. Mrs Neamore reluctantly understood and let me go. 
Finally she was out the door stepping on to the bus when she looked up and saw my grandma sitting in the driver's seat. She drove a school bus for the district but she didn't know she drove this bus. She knew I was going to be in this program this year. She didnt know why she didnt mention it. She said hello and I went back to sit with one of my friends who was taking the CNA class. We had some small talk between us  then I stared out the window for the rest of the trip thinking about what the class was going to be like. 

The trip took about twenty five minutes to get there and when we did there was a significant line of buses ahead of us that we had to wait for to unload.

Finally we did. She got off the bus and headed to the door with the crowd of other kids that were filing into the building. It was a huge campus. Luckily all the program classes were in one wing of the building so it was easy enough to find. 

When she stepped through the door and into the room it had high ceilings and it was a big open room. It look like a typical art class room.. There was shelves that went up all the way to the ceiling with different shaped bottles of paint. Paint was splattere on the walls and it smelled of saw dust. 

There was a computer station with three computers at it which at the time two of them were occupied. There was something that looked like the octopus ride that would be at a carnival. I later found out that was a shirt ink press. 
  
The teacher got up from his desk in the center of the room and told us to sit down at the tables. There was only four tables in the room so she found one with an open seat and sat down. 

There were three other people at the table, two girls and one boy. One of the girl who was a little bigger was wearing a My Chemical Romance shirt and heavy makup and had a silver ball nose ring. The other girl was a petite little thing with dark brown stringy hair and was doodling in a sketch pad. The boy at the end of the table was wearing black jeans with holes in them and a black sweat shirt that was zipped up and he had his hood up so I couldn't make out his face. He was slumped over his chair with his arms crossed. Not the most approachable person in the room.
 

   
                           Chapter 2
The teacher introduced himself as Mr. Thord. He did his introductions and showed us all the stations and how they worked. He split us into teams according to which table we were at and sent us to different stations. All four of us went to our  station in silence. 
The room was split in half by a shelf stacked high with miscellaneous art supplies. We ended up going into the other part of the room. It looked like a storage room. It had stacks with folded t-shirts and other types of appearl, stacks of different types of office supplies and papers.

 The boy seemed to know where he was going so we followed him. We walked over to a big metal contraption. He pulled some levers, push some buttons and the machine came roaring to life. He open a latch and checked to see if there was paper in it. 

Before I knew it it was spitting out papers from the other side. Before long there was a stack of orange papers at the end of machine. He gave each of us a stack and told us to fold it in thirds. I'm supposing to make pamflits. 

When we were about done I finally broke the silence and interrupted myself, hi my name is Cloe. I looked a the bigger girl first. She said her name was Angie. Promptly after that the petite girl said her name was Beth. The boy looked over at us to acknowledge us but went back to work after that. 

Days went by like this. He would have things for us to do but would never communicate with us. Finally one day I went over to the machine he was working by and introduced myself. He looked at me like I asked a question he couldn't answer. 

After a minute of him just looking at me, I gave him a eye roll and headed back to the desks we were sitting at. Suddenly I heard   "" I'm Aaron"" I half turned around and cracked a smile and nodded my head at him.
 Before long he came over and joined us at the desks and introduced himself to the other two girls. We started small talk, what's your name, where are you from. Things like that.

 I found out Angie was from this school and Beth is from Sherman which is the next town down from mine. We found out Aaron is from this school too. He was a senior and was in this class all four years. Which explains why he knew what he was doing. 
 
Day after day we came in and he started explaining how the equipment in the back worked. We had the chopper which would slice large piles of paper clean. The machine that he was working on was called a printing press. He explained that they use to print news papers off of this.   "" Now we just print off things for the teachers."" he said. He was working on business cards for one of the teachers.

As the year went on students started to drop out of class gradually. First Angie then eventually Beth did too. Before I knew it it was just Aaron and I which was better because we both got into a routine where we knew what we were doing that day. 

On slow days where we didn't really have any tasks to do, we would just sit down and talk about homework, family and life in general. He told me he had two sisters and a kid brother. He lived with his mom and his dad left when he was young.

One day Mr. Thord must have stocked something over night because there were empty boxes everywhere. We started to clear out an area and stack the boxes and Aaron got the bright idea that we should make a fort out of the boxes. So he began stacking the boxes in a square shape and I joined in. To roof it off we used a flat pallet board. 

I never had a tree house or club house growing up so I guess here it is a little too late. We would hide in it when there wasn't much to do. We built it behind the wall in the corner that separates the room so know one even knew it was there unless you knew it was there. 

We would spend some time back there  just talking or venting about our day. We got pretty close to one another. He became my best friend. I could tell him anything and he wouldnt judge. Some things I couldn't even tell my girl friends  


                       Chapter 3

Here came time for our field trip. It was an all day trip to Chicago so that ment i got to skip home room. We have to be in the school parking lot at six am that morning and it was a thirdy minute drive from my house. So I had to get up extra early which wasn't my strong suit. I had dressed up nice, with my new pink blouse I had just bought, daisy duke shorts and my Chucks. I was wearing a high pony tail which will probably give me a headache by the end of the day but it was cute.
 When we pulled up there were a bunch of kids piling onto charter buses. Mr. Thord taught three periods of graphic arts so there was alot of kids. I found Aaron. He was over talking to some other boys so I just let him be. I didn't want to be to clingy and I didn't want someone to get the wrong idea about us when they saw us hanging around. 
I got in line and filed onto a bus and sat down mid way back on the right hand side at a window seat. Prime real estate for a three hour trip. It was a fancier bus then I've been in before. I look around me and there was a little bathroom in the back. We stopped by the Casey's in town to get coffee and doughnuts so maybe that was a good thing. The seats were very comfortable with padded armrests so i could probably take a nap on the way there. 

Once everyone was on the buses and acounted for we took off. I never been on a field trip this long. We were headed for a screen printing convention. They would be demonstrations there of the big machines they use to make actual newspapers. Mr. Thord gave us a worksheet that was more like a scavenger hunt. We had to ask about they're printers.
After he did that he went up to the front to back seat drive giving the bus driver directions. 

The seat was empty next to me so I spread out my legs and took a cat nap. When I woke up the life on the bus was thriving. I got up onto the headrest of my seat and looked to the back. Boys playing trading card games, girls leaning over the aisle holding up there head to they're friends ear gossiping. To the front I saw pretty much the same thing. Except I saw Aaron up a few seats ahead of me. 

His eyes hit mine and he nodded at me with a smile. It sent a flutter though my heart. His area on the bus was full and he was talking to his guy friends so I let him be. I'm more of a people watcher than a participator so I sat there listening in on the conversations around me. 

When we finally got to Chicago we slowed down for the morning traffic. I saw passenger trains going every which way, industrial yards with old brick buildings. Finally after what seemed like a long time we got to the high rise building. They were massive, row after row of them. Finally we pull into a semi circle drive way to let the bus drop us off at the door. 

We all filed back out of the bases and stood at the corner of the doors for instruction. We all together were about 60 students so it took awhile for us to gather anywhere. Once we did Mr. Thord gave us instructions how to fill out the worksheets and split us up into teams. He let us choice so I chose to go with Aaron and his friends.  I don't think he minded. He put his arm on my shoulder and smiled at me as we ran into the building. Eventually?

Once we entered the big building there were huge displays of printing presses and other big gadgets. We made our way around the whole building. Looking at the new technology and the massive machinery. Slowly we filed out our worksheet and went to the front of the building where we entered. Mr. Thord told us to meet here at one. 

When he finally walked up to the group he told us that the buses will be back here at six to pick us up and be back here by then. Did I here him right. He's letting us lose in Chicago? He putting a lot of faith on a hoard of teenagers. Aaron and I gave eachother a little smirk then hurried out the door. 

The conversation center was right in the middle of the city. There were alot of things to do. Luckily I had been saving up my allowance and my mom gave me a little bit of money.

 There was horse drawn carriage rides next store that I wanted to go on but Aaron and his friends didn't want to go. So we headed pass just down the street a few blocks away there was a big seven story mall. We went in there it was massive.

 It had stores facing the outside of the building so you could see all the way up from the middle of the mall. I wanted to go window shopping but all of a sudden my group started to run up the escalator chasing eachother.

I didn't want to loose them so I started to run too. The escalators were set up like fire escape stair, right next to eachother, dodging other customers going up. I was apologizing as I chased after them. Before long we got to the top. At the top they had a wide viewing window  that we looked out for awhile then chased eachother back down. 
 
When we were done there we went down the street. There was a twelve foot tall eye ball sculpture. The group thought it was funny. Down aways there was a huge silver mirred jelly bean. The boys chased eachother around that. 

Mr. Thord told us to be on our best behavior or else future classes wouldn't be able to come back. I don't think the group i was in got the memo. Boys will be boys I guess, with even how old they are. 
 
Once it was about time to go we headed back to the convention center to meet up with our group. When we got back most of our group was already there. The buses came around that time too. We filed back in the buses and headed out of the city.

I was exhausted by the time we got on the bus. My shoulders and feet hurt from walking and running. Once we got on the bus and going i relaxed and put my feet up again. 

On the way I figured I would be socal and make small talk to the people around me.  There were the three girls behind me they were talking to some boys. I inserted myself in they're conversation and introduced myself. I they talking about today and what they did with their time. I found most of them were in Mr. Thord's third period class. 


                          Chapter 4

After awhile talking to them one of the boys who name was joe noticed that I was in pain and he offered to give me a should massage. I guess it was his pickup line but I hurt so much that I took him up on his offer and moved to his seat and he started. 

He noticed that I had a lot of knots in my back and tried to relieve them. He was actually kind of good at it. He said he was on the track team did this a lot. I started talking to him I started to notice we had a lot in common. We ended up talking all the way back to the high school. I enjoyed the time we had together. I guess he did to because he asked for my number before we got off of the bus. I had butterflies in my stomach by the time my mom pulled in to pick me up. 

As soon as I got in my mom asked how my day was. I told her the convention was cool but then I told her about all the other things we did and she side eyed me. I giggled. She asked if I spent time with Aaron. I did for a little bit I told her. She's heard me talking about him before. She knew I secretly liked him but that he had a girlfriend. Then I told her about Joe. She looked interested.  Does he have a girlfriend she asked. I said no. I made sure and asked about that. 

On our way home I told her about everything that happened that day. She didn't like that Mr. Thord let us go wild around the city as she called it. I told her that I was with a bunch of boys and they thought of me as a sister and wouldn't let anything happen to me. She kind of felt relieved after that.  
 
I didn't tell her too much about Joel. I didn't even know if he was going to call me. I didn't tell her that I gave him my number. She still believes in stranger danger and would flip if she knew. 

We went home and I resumed my day to day routine, school,  get on the bus and 
going to the city school. Until one day my mom and I went grocery shopping and as I was in the frozen section when my flip phone started to ring. It was a number I didn't recognize. I answered it and to my surprise it was Joel! 

He sounded enthusiastic as if I gave him the wrong number on purpose. He asked me how my day was and other small talk. Like he was building up the courage to ask me on a date. Of course when he did I said yes. 
 
I didnt drive yet so he had to come pick me up which him awhile to find my house because it was out in a raul town outside of the city. He picked me up in a souped up GT car. He took me to a really nice restaurant for our first date. I was impressed. He was such a gentlemen. Opening doors and pulling out my chair for me. 

We had a good time and he asked me if I would like to do it again. Oh course I said yes. We began going on date and texting eachother. A few week after our first date he asked me if I wanted to go to one of him track meets. I said yes again so he picked me up. He was in his track uniform. I liked way it showed off his arm muscles. 

We finally got to the field where they were having their track meet. As soon as I got out his team mates started asking me if I was Joel's girlfriend? I didn't know if we were to that point or not. I wasn't going to ask. He obviously told everyone something that I didn't know. 

Before the events started took me on a walk and asked me to be his girlfriend. It was sweet. I've never had a boyfriend before. So I didn't quite know etiquette for this situation but I said yes. He signaled to his friends across the field by raising his fists and yelling yes. His friends started cheering. 


                            Chapter 5

We were together for some time. The flirting seemed to disapate after Aaron found out about Joel and I.  I still wanted to be friends. Joel came down to  wing. We would quickly chat about our day before the bell rang for the next class. I think he personally made himself late for his class everyday just so that he could see me. It was sweet. 

As the year went on and homecoming came around he went to mine. I went in a black and red dress and he went in a black tux with a nice red button up shirt for my school colors. He looked very sharp. Everybody was looking at us. He was quite attractive so he definitely caught the eye of all the girls, even ones with dates. Which gave me a little confidence boost to know that I brought him as my date. 

I also went to his homecoming. It was fun. I wore a nice light brown dress and him in a  black tux. He seemed happy when he introduced me to all the rest of his friends. 
We danced the night away after that. I saw Aaron over in the corner and tried to go over and say hi but Joel dragged me away to go dance with his friends. 

After all that was over we went back to the old routine. Aaron was less chatty. You could tell that he did not like Joel. I didn't know if it was that I was dating him or what. I tried to keep the topic off of him. For the rest of the year Aaron and I kept our talking down to a minimum and I felt sad that that was so. 

The last day of junior year rolled around and I wanted to ask Aaron for his phone number to keep in contact. He was a senior so he wouldn't be coming back next year. I was afraid that he would say no so I didn't ask.

 He left class early saying good bye to all the rest of his friends and then gave me a sad look and I ran up to hug him. It was a brief hug but got the point across. I would miss him. Then he slipped out the back which was an old delivery dock. It led out to the parking lot. Without even looking back he got into his beat up Crown Vic and drove off.

I was mad at myself for not even saying anything. He was after all my best friend in this school. I had to push that thought out of my head. At least I had Joel. Until two weeks after school ended. I get a call from him. He wanted to take a break from our relationship. What... I asked him why. I thought it was going fine.

 We were still in the honeymoon stage of our relationship. He said he was going into the Marines. I was scared for him because he wanted to go into the infiltrate. After 9/11 they were sending troops right out of basic training into the field which scared me more. It was ultimately his choice and I couldn't make it for him. So I let him go. Completely now.

I went up to my room and cried myself to sleep that night. I've lost not only my boyfriend but my best friend also. I felt conflicted because I had no one to talk too. My girl friends wouldn't understand what im going through right now.  I just was  alone with my thoughts. Which could be dangerous. 
 
A few days later one of Joel's and I mutual acquaintances made fun of me saying he'd rather go into the marines than be with me. He was mean spirited and I ran out to the classroom and into the girls bathroom to cry. I dropped out of that class the day after. I felt hopeless, like know one wanted me. I started acting up and got even worse  grades than before. I graduated with just a 2.5.
 

    
                             Chapter 6
    Three years later. I was going to a local community college close to where I lived. I worked at a pizza place and a gas station being a hostess. I want to quit but I had tuition and other bills to worry about. 
   
      I was on MySpace one day on my break and was just scrolling through profiles and I found one that sparked my interest. I clicked on it and yes indeed it was Aaron! 
   
     We both were too apprehensive of the repercussions to ask for eachothers phone number. Now I can contact him though MySpace messenger and I did. It took me a while to figure out what to say. He wasn't very formal so i guess ""Hey, long time no see"" would have to work. 
    
    He didn't answer me right away. A few hours later he did. It was like no time had passed. We were teenagers again. He told me he had a little girl, she was four. We told eachother about our lives since high school. I loved to reminisce with him. This went on for a week or so.  Before long we decided we want to see eachother.  He wanted me to come to Harrison where he lived. So I made the journey about fifteen minutes away from my apartment to see him. 

     I was nervous to meet for the first time in so long. Would he recognize me. Would I recognize him. I wouldn't think there would be that much charged in only three years. I was anxious with anticipation. Finally I pulled up to the address he gave me. He came running out of him to meet me. It felt like a flash of lightning went through me. To see him now, grown up. He was tall and scrony and now he's filled in in all the right places.  His face had changed a bit matured in a way. His facial hair had grown in nicely instead of the soul patch he had before. 

    His little girl Kalie came out to greet me. Aaron introduced me as his friend to her and then sent her inside. His mom came to usher her inside the house. I thought maybe we could walk he said. I agreed. We started walking past and down the block. He put his arm around me and told me he's glad I found him. I was too.

We talked about what we had been doing since we last seen each other. I told about my schooling. He said after high-school his ex had gotten pregnant with Kalie. He has full custody of her now. She was a cutie. She looked just like him, his eyes, his mouth and his dark brown hair. 

     When the time came and the street lights came on I knew our time together has ended for tonight. We headed back and said our goodbyes. He hugged me more like a strong embrace for what seem like forever. I could tell he missed me. I waved to him one last time before I got in my car and that was it. 
 
     We haven't seen eachother in so long but it seemed like no time has past. He called me back a few days later and asked me if I would like to go to the local zoo with him and Kalie. I said, yes of course. 

     The day came and I made sure I was well rested. Got ready and headed out the door. When I got to the zoo I parked and rode the tram to the front entrance. Aaron and Kalie were waiting right there. I hugged him and we entered. Kalie's favorite animal was the unicorn. Mine was too I said. Look there is a striped unicorn. She laughed and said no, that a zebra. I admitted that I was wrong and it was a zebra. We walk and I had her tell me what all the animals were. She was very smart. 
 
Towards the end of the zoo visit we had to go through the gift shop to exit the zoo. Kalie instantly eyed the big stuffed giraffe and ran over to hug it. Her dad waved her over to some smaller things. She grabbed a little flexible sand filled zebra. Aw... that's cute I said to her. She looked at me and ran to the register. Aaron bought it for her. On our way out he gave me the same zebra as Kalie had. This one is for you he said. Oh my I said thank you! 

   We walked in the parking lot until we had to part ways. He embraced me the way I've never been held by a man. I looked up at him still having to stand on my tip toes. He kissed me. It was short but to the point. I'm starting to have feelings for him again and I can act on them now.

     It wasn't long until we were seeing each other on a weekly basises. I would go over to his house on Friday and he would come to my apartment Saturday's and Sundays. Fall was coming upon us and it was getting colder out. We took Kalie to a carnival and a pumpkin patch. 

   

                            Chapter 7

     I was apart of a group that put on a haunted houses every year. The haunted junkyard is what they called it this year. I invited Aaron to the orientation of the production. They let us walk through it with the lights on so we would know how to navigate it in the dark. They showed us all the hiding spots and places to slip into to disappear. 

    Aaron seemed to be having fun with the two others guys that were going to be spooking as clowns. We all got to pick out our spots and what we will dress up as. Aaron said he had a costume at home.  I wanted him to be in my area. I went along to try and find a spot.

     There was a spot with a van and a tall wood tree stump that would be perfect for us. I began looking for Aaron and finally found him in the concession stand sitting down at a table. I went to sit next to him and asked him if anything was bothering him. He said no to don't worry about it and he smiled back at me. 

     We both got up and went to return to the group. The director of the haunted house told all of us to gather here so we did. He gave us a pep talk and showed us all the emergency procedures if anything should happen. They will turn on the lights in case of an emergency and everyone gather in this area as he pointed to the ground beside him. 

     After that everyone went out to celebrate the upcoming haunting. Aaron had to go home to put Kalie to bed. So I gave him a big hug and kiss. I didn't want to let him go but I did and watch him walk out of the gymnasium. 

     The haunted house opened in September. The opening night i car pooled  with a friend. We got hyped up with caffeine. It would be a long night. We got there a hour before the haunted house soft opening. We got our costumes on and makeup and fake blood done. I ragged pants and shirt. I was supposed to be a zombie. I had dark bags under my eyes and covered in blood. Aaron hadn't showed up yet when we opened up. We weren't supposed to have our phones on us.  So I didn't get a chance to call him. 

     Finally he showed up about a half hour after  we opened. Better late than never I guess.  He tried to spook and surprise me when he did show up behind the blackout curtain. It didn't work but I pretended to be surprised by him. I hoping he was coming. He was in his black graduation gown. You need a mask I said.  So he headed towards the dress up area. I thought he would come back. I bet hes running around with those clowns. 

      About two and a half hours from when it opened suddenly the lights came on. Uh, oh!  One of the guests must have passed out out or something.  I saw the two clowns running around.  They were supposed to be scaring the people in line. Then my one of my friends came to get me in a hurry and took me to the concession stand. I asked her why the lights were turned on but she didn't answer. 

     I saw everyone escorting guests out of the building. I was so confused. Suddenly a red ambulance came through the loading dock and into the gymnasium. I still thought it was a guest falling or something.  When my mom came in. She had a sad expression on her face and  tears rolling down her face. I was worried at this point.  She hardly ever crys. What happened still confused even more. 

    She sat down in the seat next to me and held my hand.  Honey, she paused for a second to gather herself.  Honey something happened to Aaron.  What....? What happened. No one will tell me anything.  Did you know that Aaron was epileptic? No i didn't know that. Did he have 
Seizure or something? Is that why the ambulance is here, to take him to the hospital.  She said yes honey  something happened to him. No... what happened i said. I started tearing up.  My worst thoughts came rushing in. What happened to him? 

     She hugged me and told me he passed away.  I screamed as soon as she told me that. Tear came flooding out now. No... No... No.... it couldn't be i thought.  She hugged me again tighter this time. I was hysterical by this point. I saw a body bag carried out by a stretcher. That was him.

     I found out that guests were just walking by him as he was dieing thinking he was a prop. When my mom found out she tried to give him CPR but it was too late. I just sat there sobbing. Not knowing what to do. 

      Once everything was over and done with, the ambulance pulled out headed to our local morgue. They found his phone in the back with a picture from the zoo. Luckily he had a ICE phone number.  The cops were there by this point and they talked to his mother. She was yelling and sobbing you could hear from the room. I've met his mother once just by passing.  Never really introduced.  We were really to that stage in our relationship.  I only found him on MySpace two weeks ago. 

They closed down the haunted house for the night wanting to clean it up. Apparently there were a lot of body fluids a the scene. 
I was scared to go back where he was and infact I quit the haunted house all together after that night. No one could blame me. Someone had to drive me home because I was so hysterical. But I didn't want to go home, that mean I would have to go to sleep. I didn't want to know the dreams I would have. 

      I took off work for a few days.  The second day after my mom and I went to pay our respects to his family. We brought a  casserole I made the night before.  I cook when im stressed.  One of his sisters opened the door. She looked me up and down. You must be Cloe? I nodded my head as she hugged me. Not the response I thought. He told us a lot about you. Come in as she took the casserole. I could see a lot of other people payed their respects judging by the food on their kitchen counter. 

    As I walked in Kalie ran up to me and gave me a big hug.  Daddy gone away she said. I looked at his sister with a grim look. I don't know what they told her and wasn't going to say anything.  She introduced me to mother and his brother and other sister. I said hello and introduce myself. It was awkward because everyone was crying especially me. 

    When my mom and I got home I went up stairs to my room. I noticed I had a voice mail on my phone. I just thought it was a relative giving their condolences. Did think anything about it until I recognized the number. It was Aaron! I hesitated listening to it.  

     Finally I got the courage to listen to it.  "" Hey babe, still at work. But will be there pretty soon love you."" I check the time stamp and it was an hour before he got there. Probably the last call he made. I cried some more. I cried myself to sleep for the next few weeks.  I couldn't get him off my mind. Thinking if I was with him I could have helped and he maybe could have survived. 

    When something tragic like this happens you blame yourself. If I hadn't invited him he would still be alive. It was my fault. If I had known he was epileptic I would have changed my mind and told him not to go. But he loved me and wanted to make me happy and have fun. Now I have a little girl without a father for the rest of her life. I had that on my chest now too. 

     His sister called me out of the blue a couple days later and asked me if I would like to come to Aaron's funeral? I thought about it for a second and then replied yes I would.  The day came and my mom dropped me off at the church. I was in a black button down dress that went all the way down to my ankles. I didn't have much black formal wear so i had to go to the mall to get it. 

     I walked in saw a few of his friends but the rest I think was family. It was open casket. I wasn't sure if I could go up and see him. I was too scared but I gathered my courage eventually and went up see him. The thing about funeral homes is that never quite get their resemblance right. He didn't really look like himself. Kinda sunken eyes. Some people say they just look like their sleeping.  He didn't. He looked rightfully dead. 

     I was crying by that point. As soon as I looked at him. At that moment Kalie saw me and ran up to hug me. Daddy flew away she said with no sign of remorse.  I'm happy she doesn't understand death yet or this would be much harder. I distracted Kalie in the other room while the funeral was going on. Before long the funeral was over and we were all loading into limos to take us to the cemetery. 

When we got there we walk over to where he was going to be buried. There was a tent with chairs under it. I stood baby. I'm not his family. Kalie ran right up before anyone could get there and looked in the hole. She was curious. Daddy's gonna be here she said? I didn't answer. 

    The burial went fine. The sun was out but not too hot with a nice breeze. I got to throw dirt on his casket. That gave me a little bit of clarity. After the funeral was done we went to his favorite pizza place Papa Franks. We ate there and told stories about him. That was like therapy for me. I got to know him better and I liked that. He was gone too soon. I would have loved it if he could tell me these stories but there comes a time when they call you back and you never know when it is.


The moral to my story is treasure who you can when you can. Because they could be gone in a blink of an eye.

This was the first guy I ever met in person for marriage. It was an arranged marriage setup. My family is thankfully open-minded enough to let me meet the guy alone to get to know him better.

We met at Starbucks my first time at a Starbucks, mind you, because I'm not a big coffee person. I’m a full-on chai girl, always have been. So when I told him I had no clue what to order because I’d never been there before, he looked at me like I’d just told him I live under a rock. Anyway, we ended up ordering tea (ironically lol) and started talking.

Early into the convo, he tells me about his past relationship didn’t work out because of caste issues. Fine, I get it. I’ve had a somewhat similar experience too, so no judgments there.

Then he goes on to talk about his current situation: his dad is bankrupt (which I already knew and STILL chose to meet him despite my dad literally being against it). He said he takes care of both his parents and himself, pays rent for two houses, covers all his personal expenses and is basically looking for someone understanding and supportive.

I told him I knew all of this and still said yes to the meet. That should’ve meant something.

But nope, he wasn’t done. He started venting about how “difficult it is to find girls these days” and said he’s on dating apps, which… hello, RED FLAG. But guess what my dumbass did? Nodded and said, “I understand.""

He then casually added, “I want my future wife to be okay living with my parents once they shift here.”
And I was like that’s literally a bare minimum expectation, why say it like it’s some life-altering sacrifice? I said yeah, that’s completely fine by me.

So let’s pause here.
At this point in the conversation:
✅ I didn’t judge his past
✅ I accepted the financial situation
✅ I was okay with living with his parents
✅ I sat through the dating app confession
✅ I even drank overpriced Starbucks tea ffs

And what does this man say?
“I want to meet more options, but I’d like to meet you again.”

Like sir, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? Beyoncé in a saree?

This was on a Saturday.

Come Tuesday…
I get a message that basically said he doesn't thinks we’re a match and look into options.

I’m taking a science-related course and hoping to be a doctor someday. Still figuring things out, but I try to stay open and adaptable with where life leads.

I’m not here for flings or surface-level stuff. I’m looking for something grounded, slow but intentional, and built on honesty and mutual effort.

**A little about me:**  
I enjoy sketching, reading, and watching movies or anime. I’m more of a homebody than a party-goer. I like quiet, meaningful convos over small talk, and I appreciate people who bring calm energy.

**Love language:**  
I appreciate all types, but I naturally lean toward quality time. I’m not into material gift-giving. I’d rather show care through being present, spending time, and sharing small moments that matter.

**Turn-off:**  
Not a fan of someone who’s constantly on TikTok or social media all day, unless it’s work or for a brand. I value presence and intentionality, especially when spending time with someone.

**Spirituality:**  
I was raised Roman Catholic, but I now consider myself an agnostic theist. I believe values and character are more important than strict religious beliefs. Hopefully, we can find common ground in things like science, logic, and how we view life.

**Physical attraction matters too:**  
I want us to be physically and mentally attracted to each other. I’m open to exchanging photos early on. I want to like your face and your mind, and I’d want the same from you.

**What I value in a connection:**  
I believe in emotional safety, clear communication, and mutual respect. I don’t play games, and I’m not here to chase or impress anyone. If we vibe, I’ll be consistent and genuine. I’m also the type who’ll check in, listen well, and make an effort in small but thoughtful ways.

**How I take care of my well-being:**  
• Physical – I try to keep a balanced lifestyle through rest, food, and movement  
• Mental – I reflect a lot, and I’m always learning or unlearning something  
• Emotional – I value openness, directness, and kindness  
• Social – I recharge alone but appreciate quality time with the right people  
• Spiritual – I try to live with gratitude and personal integrity more than just labels

**What I hope in you:**  
Someone calm, grounded, and values her health, from keeping a normal BMI to aiming for a healthier lifestyle. You’re self-aware, emotionally stable, and intentional with how you spend your time and energy. I admire women who know their worth and show up with clarity and kindness.

**From Cavite here**  
It would be great if you're also from CALABARZON or NCR, since I’d really want to spend time in person eventually. Coffee, museums, chill lakads, or even quiet calls, simple things, done with the right person, are more than enough.

If anything here sounds like your kind of vibe, feel free to message me. I’d love to get to know you better \^\^",0,1752728381.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.5,False
1m1yqfj,https://i.redd.it/7899e1vb9ddf1.jpeg,Matching the camp costs to cost of living for food prices.,"Hey planters,

Just wanted to open a discussion on something that’s been hitting a lot of kitchen crews and camp managers hard lately — food prices.

A lot of camps are still working with a budget of around $16/day per planter, a number that used to work. But in 2025? Not so much. Prices have gone up across the board — especially in BC and Alberta — and sticking to that budget is starting to feel like trying to plant 4,000 on a slash block in 30° heat.

To put it in perspective, here’s a rough snapshot of the food I’m serving vs. what actually fits into a $16/day budget:

My current menu (~$23–$25/day per person):

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes with real syrup, sausages, fruit, coffee
Lunch: Full sandwich bar (multiple breads, meats, cheeses, condiments), many planters taking 4–6 sandwiches each, 2 large boxes of fruit, and 200 pieces of homemade block treats (like bars or squares) — 
Dinner: Hearty mains like roast chicken or chili, with mashed potatoes or rice, vegetables, salad, and bread. (If pork is offered, Muslim friendly other protein needs to be an option)
Vegetarians: Proper protein options (tofu, legumes, veggie burgers, etc.)
A $16/day menu, realistically:

Breakfast: Oatmeal or toast with peanut butter, maybe eggs once or twice a week
Lunch: 1–2 basic sandwiches (deli meat or PB&J), 1 apple, no sides, no extra fruit, 1-2 treats.
Dinner: Pasta or rice-based meals with limited protein, canned/frozen veg, no salad, no bread


It’s a huge difference. Feeding a hard-working crew of 60+ people means fueling their bodies and minds — and the budget just isn’t stretching like it used to.

So — should camp costs be adjusted to reflect rising food prices?
If not, what corners do we cut — and who feels that the most?

Would love to hear how other camps are handling it. Cooks, crew bosses, planters — what’s the situation where you are?

Dear \[agent\],

Stella’s not a typical business analyst intern; she’s a demon. But when you’re stuck in a cubicle alongside other chumps, that’s splitting hairs. Her newbie task? Recommend ways to improve morale. Her less official assignment? Sow some destruction. Even without her powers it shouldn’t be hard—the IT department’s a complete mess, mismanaged by beings too human for Stella’s comfort. Like the one that hangs over her cubicle wall. His sloppy smile gives her a nasty, melting feeling.

She’s developed a *crush,* according to her talkative new bestie. Developing feelings is a sure way to get banished, and Stella would rather thaw bodies for a living in frozen-hell than remain with the weak-willed mortals. She just wants to pass the practical and graduate from Botis-Belphegor, then land a job at a gate of burning-hell. Then she’ll sit all day, waving the footdraggers through, and work on her inferno-fantasy novel. However, she’d been sowing destructive recommendations at the stakeholder meetings for weeks, but reaping only praise. Now she’s craving it the way she craves her morning coffee, or sometimes *him.* If that red-eyed hellhound posing as the head of IT catches her basking in it, she’s cooked.

Her bigger problem? Zenisure’s employees now have beer breaks and nap rooms because of her. Yet they’re still able to function, while she can barely keep her eyes open enough to work the keyboard. If she fails she’ll have to settle for gig-work transporting wailers to destination spots. Unless she’s banished first—then she may have to embrace cubicle life, with its strange and debilitating human pleasures.

1m1yo3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m1yo3a/my_username_sucks/,My Username Sucks,"Years ago when I first started using Reddit, my wife was worried I’d start talking to other women on here. This compounded with me looking at an nfsw post one afternoon when she surprised me coming home from work. Porn made her feel betrayed and she felt I betrayed her; she’s reminded me of it continuously ever since and each time I’ve apologized. In response, I elected to stop looking at any graphic content. I set up my Reddit account with the sfw filter and I chose a username I knew would make her feel secure. Flash forward nearly a decade. She lost nearly 200lbs with gastric bypass and has had multiple plastic surgeries since we’ve had children and is physically stunning. We’ve had a rough couple of years because she voluntarily travels for work in excess of 2 weeks a month and has trouble with boundaries with other men. I worried with her lack of boundaries how this would play out and about 3 weeks ago, I found out. We were coming back from my grandfather’s funeral and she had been extremely distant in an otherwise extremely loving marriage (I thought). I asked her what was going on and she became angry that I was asking. I asked to see her phone (a boundary we’ve always honored) and find multiple sexually explicit text messages in her deleted folder to what I believe is a woman coworker of hers. I confront her about these texts to “A” and she tells me “no it’s from a smut book I’m sending to friend ‘B’”. So I look up the contact by name and the name A appears twice. She had changed the name of a male coworker to be her female work friend in her phone so I wouldn’t notice any texts. I asked her “is this the man you’ve been traveling with for work” she insists no it is not. After a big fight, I agree to work things out the next day under the condition she messages him that they are done and she’s working through things with me. She agrees and I see his picture in the process: it’s the guy she’s travelled with for work. She reluctantly admits but still insists nothing happens beyond these sexts and a couple nudes exchanged. We’ve been together 11 years so I believe her and accept working through this together as she insists it’s a mistake. My counselor agreed “work through it there’s so much to lose here it’s worth seeing through”. I’m not perfect and she tells me a lot of behaviors I’ve been doing that made her feel “unseen”, “unappreciated” and “unloved”. In response, I’ve dedicated the last 3 weeks to firing on every love language: making her coffee in bed, packing her lunch every day, writing her notes, writing her poetry, rubbing her feet, arms, back every single free moment we have. I clean from the time I get up until bed because she told me I wasn’t contributing enough before. I make the bed and buy her flowers every day trying to show her how much I care. I take the kids almost every day and give her time to herself, I have not had time to myself in years, I have them every day. I change every single diaper and wipe every butt during this three weeks. Tonight she is traveling for work and I feel something is off, I check our phone records and she’s been texting him this whole time, every single day since telling me she had blocked him and was focused on us. She insisted it was just for work, she insisted they weren’t talking about anything personal and she slipped up and said she was worried she was losing her friend in him and that she had nearly ruined her marriage. During this three weeks she’s been standoffish. She has been cold at times and loving at others. She spent the night begging me to come back. She spent the night begging me to feel the connection she has and telling me I’m the one for her. I’m so fucking broken. I’m so crushed and betrayed. I have to get our three kids to school and focus on work in 5 hours and all I can think is “what was ever real”. And to make

No and yes. Let me explain...💁🏾‍♀️

🍁 Musk No. 3 is walking outside in early fall on a random midweek afternoon. The smell of crinkled leaves, damp dirt, the soft smell of acorns and earthy spiced berries all wind bending against creaking trees. I had this scent moment in a bottle for close to a year and we parted ways - Random really, it just went left scent wise outta the blue. 

🌇  Sunwashed Santal, that's my boo! There is something soothing and gritty about Sunwashed Santal - It'll take you on a calm walk while you're trying to figure some sh¡t out. The setting is absolutely flexible because Sunwashed Santal isn't a season or place, it's a feeling - Like you're levitating between the Horizon line, in the middle of Dusk and Twilight - Something very Liminal about Sunwashed Santal and I dig it!

🕍 Book Loft picks up where Musk No. 3 and Sunwashed Santal left off - After the long walk and the settling of a restless mind, Book Loft is the close of an evening. Que the multi dog-eared book with the faultlined spine and coffee stained pages. This is what intentional calmness feels like, chill with a purpose.

💡My Guess about the Riddle...
Not triplets, not sisters but definitely first cousins who get along really well together and even hang out. They all bring a different tone of Chill, providing a wonderful mood reset. The use of Santal and Citrus against soft woods is quintessential to the mellow flavor of all three. Very cool scents that fit in any occasion which is rare.

*As experienced and narrated by Werner Herzog*

I stood before the great glass facade of **The Strong Museum of Play**, a cathedral erected not for gods, but for the ghosts of childhood. Children streamed in, laughing, tripping over their own velocity. Parents followed with coffee and resignation. The building pulsed with color — not organic color, but curated, synthetic tones designed to simulate wonder.

Inside, it was louder than a war zone — not in violence, but in stimulation. Lights blinked, cartoon voices looped endlessly, speakers whispered slogans about imagination and joy. There were exhibits on video games, dolls, superheroes. Icons trapped behind glass. Memory frozen, like insects preserved in amber.

# The Architecture of Nostalgia

Each hallway was an homage to the past — but the past was flattened. Pac-Man, Barbie, LEGO, Tickle Me Elmo — they stood like fossilized idols in a theme park church. This was not play. This was **worship** of consumerism under the guise of innocence.

The deeper I went, the more it felt like a mausoleum. Not of death, but of joy—dissected, labeled, and archived. Play, once spontaneous and feral, was now indexed, sanitized, and given corporate sponsors.

The arcade machines chirped with artificial mirth. A small boy stared at the joystick, unblinking. Nearby, a mechanical Big Bird sang in an endless loop, its voice cracked with age. This was not delight. It was repetition. Behavioral programming. A laboratory of dopamine.

# The Children

There were children running, yes. But look closely. Not all were laughing. Some clung to devices, others wandered from exhibit to exhibit with deadened eyes, already numbed by a world that asks them to perform happiness rather than feel it.

A toddler in the “Sesame Street” section reached out to touch Oscar the Grouch’s trash can. His hand was met with plexiglass. He cried. His father looked at his phone.

# The Adults

The adults wandered like pilgrims through an amusement necropolis, their expressions strained between nostalgia and dread. They pointed out toys from their youth, forcing smiles, hoping their children would care — but the past is not transferrable. It is a private haunt.

What is sold here is not play. It is the illusion of continuity. The pretense that if we preserve the trinkets of our childhood, we preserve ourselves.

# My Reflection

The Strong Museum of Play is a monument not to joy, but to its **replication**. It simulates childhood in the way a wax museum simulates life — impressive, yes, but cold and unmoving. Here, every corner is curated, every giggle anticipated, every memory monetized.

I left with the sound of a malfunctioning animatronic echoing behind me. Its smile was frozen, its eyes blinking too slowly. Outside, a child threw a tantrum in the parking lot. It was the most honest moment of the day.

There is no true play in a world where every moment is branded. There is only the performance of play — a shadow of the wild, unsupervised magic we once knew, now packaged for tourists and parents desperate to feel something.

Perhaps we cannot reclaim wonder. We can only **visit its museum**.",0,1752727599.0,Rochester,1,0.2,False

1m1yhq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1m1yhq9/my_take_on_12_stepaa_groups_the_program/,"My take on 12 Step/AA groups, the program","I got so burned out on AA. l did it for 3-4 years. I have so many problems with the paradigm of AA/12 step groups. I am not a mental health professional I just want to vent a bit here. My opinions definitely go against the grain of AA/12 step groups.

I am fairly convinced AA sets people up to relapse. I guess my root problem with AA is that it misdiagnoses a complicated set of circumstances as one thing and then treats that one thing with faith healing a one size fits all way. I don't believe that is effective for something that varies so much. In other words, they attach a lot of really unneccessary and counterproductive ideas to sobriety which can over time cause you to just be miserable. Even with the best intentions people in AA overstep their bounds contributing to a toxic culture though on the surface it may not appear that way.

I think it can be helpful to just go and make coffee and be social but they are so fucking dogmatic about the program. Like you have to do sobriety Bill Wilson's way or you will relapse and die. If someone stays sober its because of the program. If someone doesnt stay sober they didnt work enough of a program. I don't even think the program is effective at treating what it claims to treat. After doing that shit for years it feels like chiropractic, at best placebo based on some guy who talked to ghosts.

So much groupthink, so much grouptalk, I see AA as a religion or a cult or something. They say so much heavy handed shit in those meetings. I dont even think they are helping the newcomer by throwing AA at them. None of them are acting as clinical professionals.

So like I don't want to discourage someone from doing AA if its helpful to them, seriously it was helpful and just what I had to do a few years... but I hate the worldview AA gives people. I am convinced that it causes people to be worse off. If youre unhappy, its because you aren't doing enough of a program. If you're happy you better do more program because you are about to relapse.

It always felt like the blind leading the blind. I realized the people I met with long term sobriety who had what I wanted were sober but not doing ""the program.""

If someone wants to be sober enough theyll do anything, including AA, I think they have a high likelihood of getting sober anyways. Most of the people who go to AA don't get or stay sober at all. I am not convinced its as effective as the members claim it is. 

The entire nature of  the programs philosophy that ""you can't get sober on self knowledge or self will"" seems really really contradictory to me. Even if AA is working the way they say it does, someone had to choose to stop to even do the steps. Someone had to choose to walk into an AA meeting. I think learning to change your behaviors is a great part of life, AA is about doing more AA and tying it up with recovery. 

My only point here is you can be happy and sober without constantly stressing about what step youre on, even the most hardcore addicts ive met got and stayed sober years with no AA.

I tried AA again for a few months and just got so burned out on it. Met some lifetime best friends in AA truly, the best part of it is the ""fellowship"". I also met some of the worst human beings I have ever encountered in AA, people who are so shitty and toxic, I am glad I am not around it. 

I am glad theres such a big group of people getting sober around the world but I am so depressed it has like all the same things going on in it as a cult or high demand religion.

I liked the people and all the elements that werent the 12 steps or the program. 

I feel like my definition of sobriety is ""not getting inebriated"". So no booze, weed, drugs. Thats what works best for me. In AA if you don't do Bill Wilsons 12 steps youre just a dry drunk headed for a relapse.

People internalize all this shit. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. So much happier not going to any of those meetings at all.

That being said, just my experience. I still have many close friends really into AA and it seems to be mostly positive for them. So I get it not everyones going to experience what I did. We are all just seeing a different part of the same elephant. Theres a positive side to AA for sure but the negatives outweighed the benefits when I got on my feet again for a while.

My procedure was booked for Wednesday 5pm.
I was given Eziclen (Sudaprep in the US I think) as a prep solution.

Instructions were:
On the day before the procedure, avoid fruit, veg and fibre (literally that's all, no instructions to fast etc).
For prep, on the day of the procedure, take the 1st dose at 7am diluted in 500ml water, then drink another litre of water.
At 1pm take the 2nd dose in exactly the same way.

On the day before, I had a yoghurt for breakfast and then munched on some white bread throughout the morning. Last couple of bites of bread were at 2pm, then I just had liquids from then on, including coffee, ice tea and Sprite. 

On the day, in between prep doses I had a sports drink as well as the water.

The prep went well, I had to be within 5 metres of the toilet. I went very frequently after each dose, but it tapered off around 3 to 3.5 hours after finishing the dose. I still wanted to go at like 4:10pm, right before I got in the car, and then again just before 5pm at the clinic, which made me a bit anxious as I thought the bathroom trips would have stopped by then.

The procedure itself was unexpectedly smooth and quick. There was an anesthesiologist there as well as a nurse. I got an IV canula and gas (or oxygen?). I was told it would be sedation, so I expected to be half awake for it, but as far as I am concerned I went out like a light and woke up when it was all done! I couldn't remember a thing, just like general anaesthesia.

There was no irritation afterwards, just a bit of bloating or tummy ache. I still had to go to the bathroom a couple of times, before finally getting to dinner! 

All in all, if you have a bathroom nearby and the journey to the clinic/hospital isn't too long, it's all good. Highly recommended for anyone with any issues or family history of issues in that part of the body.

My husband is about to turn 40 and I am really struggling thinking of a nice gift for him! He is definitely one of those people where if he wants something, he will buy it himself. He loves snowboarding, motorcycles & choppers, mountain-biking, expensive sunglasses, clothes, and music – But he is quite particular about these things, and I wouldn’t want to buy the wrong thing, and I think he prefers to choose these things himself.

The usual recommendations are not so helpful to me. I should mention that he works overseas on a 28 day off / 28 day on roster, so planning experiences in advance can be quite difficult (We also have just come back from holiday already and we have another booked). He also would not be interested in any cooking classes etc or a custom pen, or any sort of booze, his best friend got him a custom knife set last year, he has just spent $10k on his first watch, and he owns multiple sets of red wing boots already, among others.

Some previous gifts I’ve given him –
Vinyl player,
Speaker system,
Smokai BBQ smoker,
Coffee machine,
Nice oilskin jacket,
Vinyls – He like metal music + outlaw country.. Think Black Sabbath, The Shrine, Orchid, Windhand, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings.
Signed Natural Child T shirt,
I hand make him a card every year along with a handwritten letter.


This year, I have already got him a Born Free Motorcycle Festival book and a repress of Orchids Mouths of Madness vinyl album, but I would like to get him something really cool for his main present. I have thought about an Ooni pizza oven, but I am unsure if he will think that’s as cool as I do (he does love pizza), or whether that’s even a suitable gift for a 40th. What are some great ideas? Is there something I’m not thinking of?? My budget is around $1,000.00. Any help is appreciated!!

1m1yew9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m1yew9/aitah_for_getting_rid_of_a_friendship/,AITAH for getting rid of a friendship?,"so some context… I (21F) used to live in a small town and I met “S” (20F) after being introduced from a mutual. I moved after my first year of college due to narcissistic mother issues. Me and this girl (we’ll call her S) were friends for 3 1/2 almost 4 years. The past two years I’ve been trying to get my shit together because I’ve been struggling with my narcissistic mother and school and finding a job. I ultimately had to drop out of college to figure shit out. During the time I was figuring my life out I stopped talking to my support back home because I was afraid they’d judge me in some way. The friend group back home consisted of me, “S” and a few other girls. The moment I moved majority of them stopped speaking to me (honestly people start acting weird once you move and I had to learn that the hard way)…. anyways, not the point but it adds a bit of perspective. So during the time I wasn’t speaking with “S” I was hanging out with one of my other friends (we’ll call her “M”). Now “M” (20F) goes to the same college as “S” does. ANYWAYS… (I’m sorry for bringing this in multiple directions I have autism and have a hard time staying on track) 

Fast forward to December of last year. My ex boyfriend broke up with me so “S” takes me out to go clubbing, we have a bunch of fun and whatnot. I stay over at her dorm for the night and we go out separate ways in the morning. A couple weeks go by and I haven’t talked or messaged “S”. Mind you she doesn’t text first any of the times that I’ve reached out and try to make plans for her to come see me in the state that I live in as it’s different from my hometown. “S” never comes and goes to hang out with the girls we used to talk shit about, the girls that used to talk shit about us and so on and so forth. Of course I get upset but never say anything. 

Now fast forward to early January of this year. I texted “S” on multiple occasions asking her if we could meet up for coffee so I can explain to her why I haven’t been speaking to her or really anyone from home. She never pulls through and basically proves her point from years ago about how I’m an inconvenience. Which doesn’t feel great. 

I start hanging out with “M” more and her roommate and her good friend “R” (20F) which is my now boyfriend’s (21M) good friend’s little sister. I go basically every weekend up until this situation happens. Me, “M” , “R” and “M’s” Roommate all go to this on campus party at the college. It was a party specifically for sophomore’s of the college (remember that). (“S” is an incoming senior in college so it was a little weird to see her there with her friend group.) The 4 of us get there, have fun, play beer pong, and dance it up a bit while getting lit…yk your normal college party. 20-25 minutes into the function, “S” arrives with her friend group 🤨. I specifically turn my back from the group and “S” as I didn’t want to start any problems, and as an autistic adult; I hate confrontation. So “M” sees that they come in and I tell “M” that we should skedaddle before drama starts happening. I make my way to the door while ducking my head so “S” doesn’t see me. Well…surprise! She saw me. “S” puts her hands on both “M” and her roommate while storming out into the hall to start some shit. “S” calls me all these names, tells me how weird I am, tells me how she had to “convince everyone to be friends with me because they all thought I was weird.” (WORD FOR WORD I TELL YOU) She then steps forward like she’s about to swing on me, but her now ex boyfriend had to hold her back so she wouldn’t (oh how i wish she did, i would’ve quite literally pressed charges and had her kicked out of her school.) “S” goes back inside and “M” “R” and the roommate all come out and ask wth happened. They all told me that “S” put her hands on the two of the girls to shove them out of the way to get to me. 

A couple days go by and I let it marinate. I feel extremely shitty from that interaction and it made me rethink of who my friends really were, and how I  felt that they were truly better off without me. So I message “S” on instagram this: “hey “s”, i’m really hurt by this but honestly i don’t think you care. honestly “m” responded to me whenever you didn’t and put the effort time and time again to see me. whether it be in hometown or at college. I wanted to explain to you everything that’s been going on in person as i don’t feel text justifies any sort of apology but now that you’ve made this decision hell it sucks but good luck in life i guess. to throw away a friendship over me hanging out with someone else is honestly absurd and seriously petty for no reason and just shows the projection of you being fake. as my friend you were supposed to defend me like i have you countless of times. getting told by you people called me fake and you giving into it shows that you are no friend at all. good luck in life “s” cause this perspective will get you nowhere.”

Anyways, AITAH? I don’t know what to do and I’m feeling hurt by it to this day (July 17th)

(he wasn’t being serious) Now if im going back and looking at my moms ex relationship she paid for everything and was married to a lazy man who sat on the couch everyday while she worked two jobs. In my mind when my bf asked me that i was thinking to myself about how i don’t wanna turn out like my mom so i said no. All the sudden he got offended and was really annoyed with me saying no. he said he isn’t paying for anything for me anymore. I understand his perspective and why he would say that because it must of felt bad for him when i said no. But on my end i feel like im just trying to protect myself from opening a door to being treated how my mom was. i explained this to him and he says he understands but he won’t pay for anything anymore. Even though i do buy him coffee and drinks just like he does for me, and his birthday was a month ago and i spent like 600 on getting him stuff.

I know it’s subjective but how many hours a day of practice is typical when starting out? So far I’ve had 8 lessons, my teacher gives me 6 different assignments to work on between lessons. It seems like that’s about 3 hours a day minimum? Does that seem about right? When I studied classical I did about 2, some days more, some days less. I’m finding it very challenging and maybe overwhelming, to the point I’m wondering if I have the stamina and mental concentration/focus.

Did I overreact?,"I recently worked under someone who initially seemed professional but slowly started saying things that made me feel deeply uncomfortable.

I’m a female engineer and recently started working in a company where I was told I’d be in a technical role. But once I joined, I was placed in a sales-related position instead, with the promise that my engineering work would come “after 2–3 months.” One day, my boss and I were visiting a client location. It started raining, and without waiting for my consent, he took me for coffee. I didn’t say yes or no, and just went along because it was hard to say anything in that situation. During the coffee, he started talking about chakras, saying he practices meditation, and then went into details about the first chakra being related to s**. He continued to say that “most people are attached to the first chakra.” Hearing this from my boss in a casual setting made me really uncomfortable. Later, he also said that his company is ""his and mine child,” and referred to me as part of it which, again, didn’t sit well with me. The next day, he casually told me I should look more like a model to attract young guys supposedly to help in sales. I didn’t feel comfortable at all with that comment, especially coming from someone in a position of authority. I stepped away from the job after just a few days. I wasn’t feeling safe, respected, or aligned with the environment.

When I finally tried to express my discomfort in a respectful way, he dismissed it under the idea of a “family work culture,” and later, in chats, he told me I was “like a daughter” to him, and when I expressed discomfort about previous comments, he even said he could “talk to my father”. I’m an adult professional, and this kind of response felt inappropriate and controlling.Now, he’s saying I’ve “blamed” him unfairly, and that he’s “learned a lesson after 45 years,” making it feel like I’ve done something wrong just by setting boundaries. 

Now I find myself wondering:
Was I too sensitive? Did I overreact? Or was I right to step away before things got worse?

It’s hard when you’re just starting your career. I didn’t want to burn a bridge, but I also didn’t want to stay silent in an environment that didn’t feel okay.

Now D and me have had a very strange relationship he has known me since I was born and from what I heard I was always his favorite. We were separated for a while due to family issues but in the last year or so D reached out to me wanting to catch up so I said yes of course.We went out for coffee and it went great and over the year we hung out more and more. I've started to notice lately that D likes to pull pranks he thinks is funny but I don't think it is for a person his age. Now for context I really love pranks when they are actually funny. His favorite prank he does consists of him walking in front of me or his mom or friends while they are sitting on the couch bending over and farting loudly right in whomevers face while they are eating.he also comes out of his room after a shower and tells whomever is in the room to look and when they do he drops his towel and shakes his naked butt at everyone in the room or he will take fart spray and spray it everywhere whether it's in a store,restaurant or at home and run out and lock doors so your stuck in the room with the smell. The prank that finally drove me over the edge was what I believe was crossing a line. I recently had a friend who committed suicide and I found him in his bathroom with a cut throat it was very traumatic and I told my cousin this in confidence.so the other day my cousin came to pick me up and he was laying in his car holding his throat with blood coming out from it and pretended to pass out so I freaked out and tried to call 911 and when I was about to ask for a ambulance he sits up and starts laughing showing me the blood was from him having a mole removed earlier that day I looked at him in anger and said you need to act your damn age and I went back inside and texted him to tell him I don't want to see him ever again.now he calling everyone in the family telling them that I blocked him over a silly prank meanwhile his mom and friends and his son are all on my side saying he takes things to far.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: LG Twins vs. Lotte Giants (2025 KBO, July 17)**  
*Where pitching perfection meets offensive fireworks—and maybe a few misplaced shoelaces.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The LG Twins (2nd in KBO) and Lotte Giants (3rd) are statistical mirror matches with contrasting strengths. The Twins boast a **3.82 ERA**, the league’s stingiest pitching staff, while the Giants lead the league in batting average (**.280**) and have a rising star in Al Gamboa (6-1, 2.11 ERA). But here’s the twist: Twins ace **Son Ju-young** has a personal vendetta against the Giants, holding them to **0 runs in 13 innings this season**. That’s like a goalie who’s never let a goal in during a rival team’s visits—*if goalies drank coffee to stay awake and baseball had more drama*.

**Implied Probabilities (from DraftKings):**

* **Lotte Giants ML (-115):** 52.4% chance to win.
* **LG Twins ML (-115):** 47.6% chance to win.
* **Under 7.5 Runs (-115):** 52.4% chance.
* **Lotte -1.5 Runs (-150):** 60% implied probability (Giants are favored by 1.5 runs).

The spread and totals suggest a low-scoring, pitcher’s duel, but the Giants’ offense could have other plans.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, MVPs, and a Former Circus Acrobat

* **LG Twins:** Son Ju-young is on a **27-inning scoreless streak** against the Giants. If he keeps this up, he’ll need a new nickname—maybe “The Wall” or “That Guy Who Never Lets the Giants Score.”
* **Lotte Giants:** Al Gamboa, their June MVP, is a rookie phenom with a 2.11 ERA. He’s like a human spreadsheet, calculating strikeouts before the pitch leaves the mound. Also, the Giants’ offense is a **.280 BA machine**, which is roughly the batting average of a squirrel trying to crack a nut with a baseball bat.

No major injuries reported, but the Giants’ return of FA An Chi-hong adds firepower. Imagine a team with a **.280 BA and a 4.79 ERA**—it’s like having a Ferrari engine in a miniv

I made instant Starbucks stick coffee for years, then someone gave me an old used B40 about 6 years ago, and it finally just died! None of the YouTube fixes worked, so I decided to go looking for one. 

I just found two used B40s machines in pristine shape at a local thrift store, one was $13, the other one was $11.  They are heavy weight, have a metal plate on the bottom, and yeah, they are loud. I don’t care! Back in business. I found these at the same store a few days apart, they don’t even have scratches around the buttons, no scale, my machine we used so much the picture of the cup scratched completely away so that there is only a blue light on the button we use, and it has been like this for years. So I know these machines haven’t been used much.

I brewed a half gallon of vinegar through each (many cycles) out in the garage for good measure. I bought the extra one since I have a feeling that next time one dies I might not be able to find another one. 

The old B40s on ebay are more like $40 to $50 with shipping and it’s harder to tell what shape they’re in from the pics, but also an idea though.

I’ve done the same with kitchen appliances, I got some vintage machines that don’t wear out like the newer ones.

I take it at 6:30 every morning, and I'm seeing such improvement! My executive dysfunction is way less strong, my impulsivity is under control, and I'm finally able to stick to my calorie deficit with ease.

However, since upping my dose, I've started crashing in the afternoon. I'm so productive it's almost superhuman until about 3 o’clock, and then I get sleepy and lose all motivation to do ANYTHING. If I take a nap, it just leaves me groggy. If I have cup of coffee, then I can't sleep at night. I'm still trying to find a fix for it.

Is this common? Is it a temporary side effect that will go away? Can I do anything to fix it? I thought about asking my doc to split my dose into a twice daily thing but I'm afraid that will affect my sleep…

(I dont think it's dehydration or an electrolyte imbalance cause I'm drinking over a gallon of water daily and taking vitamins and electrolytes throughout the day.)

My husband and I are thinking about launching a mobile coffee cart (kind of a dream we’ve had for a while), but we’re total newbies to the business side of things. We’ve heard that an LLC is a good idea for protection, but we have zero clue how to actually get one set up in Georgia.

Is the paperwork something two people can manage on their own, or is it worth paying someone to do it for us? Also, any Georgia specific quirks or fees we should know about before diving in? 

Would love to hear from anyone who’s started an LLC here recently, especially if you were as clueless as we are! Appreciate any advice!",2,1752726066.0,llc_life,0,1.0,False
