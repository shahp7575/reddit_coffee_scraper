I've been working on the Gengar to unlock BFS at 50 for help on OGPP I could put all of the candies into it to either hit 50 or 49ish I can't remember which. What I'm undecided on is whether I'd be better off doing that, or if I'd be better using the candies to raise one or multiple others to 30 (such as charjabug and Bewear) or just focus on something else in general. 

I'm not exactly being prevented from making meals by lack of corn, but it does take up a space most of the day if I'm making a corn meal 3x right now. I can't get enough coffee yet, but that's not a huge deal since I can't consistently make the new coffee meals until I can get around to buying a fire stone for Flareon. I'm really interested in getting this Dedenne maxed out, and that might honestly benefit me the most at this point since I tend to focus more on making high level meals now than just running berries. I could also rush Primeape to 50 for the bfs/HB combo, but I don't know that that's urgent. I already have a great Golduck and an Espeon that's technically better than the Amphy, so I think that's probably last in line. 

I guess my main goals would be maxing out a Dedenne, working towards 60 on the double leeks Quaquaval because leek production does actively limit my meals, or taking Gengar/Shuppet to 50 for OGPP although I already have a 52 Raichu and a 50 Spookychu both with BFS.

1gka5h7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gka5h7,[DOW1] My Favorite Skirmish Map,"As a super duper noob of 40K DOW for two decades, I have a favorite map for skirmish matches. It's called 'Quatra', a map for 4 players. It's quite simple and unique map with only one passage while the other ones have two or three entrances for your main base.


The road towards each bases are kinda narrow and there are a lot of grounds for cover, making any units to proceed slowly.


What I usually do on this map is to send my first worker squad toward the entrance of enemy's base. Meanwhile my HQ will be producing workers and they will be constructing an armory and two power plants.


When my first power plant starts to produce resources, my first worker squad will arrive to the destination. Since I can't beat their scout army or hero with my worker squad, I don't engage with them. I build a turret instead.


When the first turret is complete, I am halfway there. Two turrets will make you stronger. More than three of them will make you invincible, stopping any troops to get past my turrets. At this point the enemy will suffer from low income.


I produce one to two basic infantries in case their sneaky scouts who I missed in the early game are capturing the requisition points inbetween my HQ and their HQ. I let one infantry squad to start capturing the req points while the other one has to look for their scout.


If the enemy has the longer ranged armies than mine, I should pay attention to my frontline of turret field. Otherwise it would be no more than just a turret defense, regardless of the difficulty.


When I realize that there are no workers or armies inbetween us, it becomes nothing more than just an experimental match. I can make a cup of coffee while my factory is producing some relic units. Or I can just win the game by preparing only a few infantries.

A few months a go I was inspired by side story: Rize to write a scenario preceding the events of TG chapter 1 (focusing on Kaneki's growing interest in Rize).  What was supposed to be a fun little one shot turned into a fan novel project (adapting manga to novel format) which I'm currently working on. 

Here is a portion of the first chapter: 

""An avid reader, you frequent your local coffee shop for the atmosphere and traditional bitter drink. Not only do you find the aroma enticing, you find it the perfect companion with which to read the latest book you've become enamored with.

Not many things interrupt the endeavors beset in your beloved literary landscapes, but taking notice of the beautiful girl across the room usurps your attention. Her beauty might have been a transitory distraction, but as you note the title of the book she's holding ransom - your favorite author's latest work in her clutches - your thoughts begin to fixate on her.""

I then proceeded to go around my entire kitchen taste testing every little thing I had seen but not eaten out of fear/anxiety. And the next thing I knew the eh had begun and stayed for a welcomed 4 month vacation, which inevitably led to me making an incredible amount of progress in my recovery

I've been drunk 5 times in the past 3 weeks which is heavy drinking for me.

What scared me is *I began to like it*. In all my relapses I have never liked the idea of being able to drink when I reflected on my actions sober. The negatives of drinking always outweighed the good. I had a routine down. I would wake up the next morning after drinking sick as a dog chug a water bottle, sleep in as long as I could, doordash a ridiculous meal, and watch Youtube drama videos and let my brain rot until I felt better around 6pm then I would get a coffee. 

Today I woke up after doing the normal embarrassing drinking stuff (texting people I haven't spoken to in years posting ridiculous things on social media) and felt like the negatives' are finally outweighing the positives. My hangover routine is not working and more than anything I just wish that I did not drink last night. I am just sulking thinking about my actions and feeling like shit.

I have about 70 dollars worth of beer and seltzers I am going to throw out as I cannot have it around or I will drink it.

Hey folks, I thought I‚Äôd share my experience with eHarmony in case anyone is on the fence about online dating. I signed up about six months ago, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I‚Äôm Matt, a 32-year-old guy who‚Äôs had his fair share of dating ups and downs, but here I am now, happily in a relationship with a fantastic woman named Julia, all thanks to eHarmony.

When I first registered, I was a bit overwhelmed by the length of the questionnaire. Seriously, it took me a good hour to complete! But looking back, I really appreciate the effort they put into it. The questions were deep and thorough, covering everything from my lifestyle to my beliefs and values. I felt like they took the time to really get to know me, which I think is why I ended up matching with Julia, who shares so many of my core values.

eHarmony's matchmaking algorithm is what drew me in; it promised to connect me with people who actually had the potential for a long-term relationship rather than just casual flings. After the exhaustive questionnaire, I was presented with a list of matches based on compatibility scores. I spent a lot of time checking profiles and sending messages. It felt way more personal than other dating apps I‚Äôd tried.

In terms of cost, I opted for the six-month subscription, which came to about $60/month. So, around $360 total. To be honest, at first, I hesitated a little about spending that much. But the quality of the matches and the depth of the connections I made justified the price. It‚Äôs not cheap, but if you‚Äôre serious about finding a partner, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the investment.

As for Julia, we matched about a month into my subscription. Her profile caught my eye immediately, and I was drawn to her love of hiking and cooking‚Äîtwo of my passions as well. We had some great conversations, and after a few weeks of chatting, we decided to meet up for a coffee. Honestly, I felt nervous but also super excited. From that first date, it was clear we had a connection, and it blossomed from there.

I know dating apps can be hit or miss, but I truly believe eHarmony sets itself apart. If you‚Äôre looking for something serious, I would recommend giving it a try. Just be prepared for a commitment‚Äînot just in terms of money but also in terms of being open and honest with yourself about what you want.

In short, [eHarmony ](https://www.eharmony.com/)helped me meet Julia, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. We‚Äôre now planning future adventures together, and I genuinely think it‚Äôs a journey worth starting. Good luck out there, everyone!

Notes on the ones I have:

* I've mentioned Beware before, and her vanillas somehow go weird on me. It's unfortunate, because I really wanted to love Beware (the tea, cardamom and black pepper are so good).
* Ophelia - like lemon cake that stays lemon cake on me! some cake notes go balsawood on me so this is extra lovely.
* Oops... - this smells so goddamn decadent in the bottle, so if her vanillas work for you and you like this kind of sweetness, get you some. I just wish the vanillas didn't go weirdly waxy on me.
* Moondust will cover you - I'm not sure how I feel about this because I have one that has listed notes, and this iteration she doesn't have notes listed....so I might even have to get this one for comparison and science. (I like the one I have...but feel weird possibly spoiling the notes because she wants you to have the experience? I don't know.)
* Trip to the Moon - I do like this one, and I guess vanilla crystal is okay on me? sorry that I don't have better notes on this for whatever reason.
* Velvet Heart - this is a pretty floral but personally isn't for me.
* Violet Pumpkin Tea - I like violet and I like pumpkin, so I needed this. I never would have paired violet and pumpkin together, but glad that I got to experience it. Also oddly the vanilla in this one behaved for the most part. I do get a touch of waxiness in the dry down but it's not as prominent like in Beware or Oops.

If I do end up getting this iteration's Moondust Will Cover You, I'll probably also get Spookshow. I haven't tried Dirt, but I do like her dirt note (I love dirt paired with sweet/gourmand notes).

1gk9s59,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gk9s59/datv_act_3_spoilers_dav_all_spoilers_laments_on/,[DATV ACT 3 SPOILERS] [DAV ALL SPOILERS] Laments on Lucanis Romance,"I feel like I need to get this off my chest. I want to start with my dislikes of the romance first and then talk about what I loved and what I think would have made it better if it was just one or two little things.

  
One of my biggest problems is something I see from others: the pacing. I feel like Acts 2 and 3 just have little redeeming conversations where the heart dialogue options make any sense for the romance. It just feels like you're being overlooked when you say any of the romantic dialogue to him and he avoids even acknowledging it and changes the topic. Acts 1 and the ending feel extremely disconnected from the middle Acts. 

  
Another issue is the Neve dialogue and being locked out from the romance if you choose Minrathous. My first playthrough I chose Treviso and did not know you could get locked out if you chose the other. It is also very strange it doesn't lock you out from a hardened Neve, though. I got lucky with the dialogue between Neve and Lucanis also, though. I did not pair them up very often and they did not have many conversations together in my Lighthouse. There were a couple comments I felt weird about `them talking about coffee`, but I feel like it came off more friendly since I was already decently further into the romance and didn't think twice about it. I think if I saw them blatantly flirting while I was trying to romance him I would have been more jaded about Neve, especially if I felt my advances were not being reciprocated.

  
I was also bothered by the scene in Act 2 where he just leaves Rook hanging and walks off. I have no problem with that at all, but why is there no follow-up to that? We aren't going to talk about it at all? If there was a conversation they could have after I think it would have truly made the romance better. Even just a ""there is so much going on and I don't want you to get hurt because of me"" would have changed the whole mood of the romance.

  
The last issue I have is that it seems like he should be a complex character based on his upbringing, abuse, and possession, but it just feels like his personality is being a Crow, coffee, and never truly opening up. I feel like a lot of his reactions to situations are just so calm and dismissive of situations he's in or the people around him. One scene that bothered me was in Act 3 when you're talking in his room with him and it feels like Rook is about to tell him her feelings and he just says ""Don't"". Rook walks away all flustered saying it's not like that was on their mind all day or anything.

  
Now on to the things I loved about the romance. First, the coffee scene is great. That was what got me dead set on the romance. Perfect mix of flirty and desire. It left me wanting more and to know more about him. The fact he says he will keep in mind Rook's favorite drink is so thoughtful behind a character they were building up to be brooding with a dark background.

  
The second part I loved was the look that Lucanis and Rook share after Inner Demons is just so sweet. And even that Viago and Teia notice there's something going on between them is cute. I feel like after this quest should have been their first kiss, though.

  
The romance scenes after A Cage for the Gods is honestly so sweet. I wish he had acted more like that prior to this point. Being terrified of losing Rook after everything else that has been lost in his life. It was like a final push for him to embrace his feelings and stop being afraid to allow himself to feel. I also like that when they are laying together, he asks Rook just to talk to him because it's comforting to him. That's probably one of the first times in life he has had a genuine connection with someone and truly felt love and not like a pawn. In some ways, this scene reminds me of the nuances of the Astarion romance. A very complex set of feelings and realizing it's okay to want to be loved and not used. I just wish there was more build up that allowed me to feel like this type of relationship was forming prior to this point. I also enjoy how loving and protective of Rook he is. Telling Rook he's their dagger and will always protect them is adorable.

  
I think that if things were changed just slightly it would have made all of this just better. It doesn't even need to be big changes. I think that if he was going to be conflicted about his feelings and left Rook hanging after almost kissing, then they needed to add a follow-up conversation. I wish there were more personal conversations between Rook and Lucanis in Acts 2 and 3 that just allowed him to open up just a little more to Rook, even if it is about trauma so that we can see it is hard for him to allow himself to feel, especially as a Crow. The Neve flirting needs to not happen if you're romancing Lucanis. That just genuinely makes it worse for people who feel like they aren't being reciprocated in Acts 2 and 3. I also think their first kiss needed to be in Act 3. Even if it was just a kiss on the cheek as a thank you for all of Rook's help, that's a start. Jumping straight in to first kiss and sex right after A Cage from the Gods was a bit jarring. I didn't hate it, but it felt rushed at that point.

  
These are my feelings and I felt like I just had to get them out to someone... *Anyone*. Thanks for reading.",5,1730821784.0,dragonage,1,1.0,False

In today‚Äôs epistle we hear the apostle Paul‚Äôs works to the Christians at Corinth. His warning to them is a simple one that requires our attention every so often. Often as we read the Scriptures and the New Testament we are reminded of things that we might take for granted or ways that we may have become complacent in our own lives, and attitudes.

Listen to these words: ‚ÄúBrethren, I appeal to you, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissension among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. For it has been reported to me by Chloe‚Äôs people that there is quarreling among you, my brethren. What I mean is that each one of you says, ‚ÄúI belong to Paul,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI belong to Apollos,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI belong to Cephas,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI belong to Christ.‚Äù Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispos and Gaius; lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name. (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)‚Äù

For St. Paul, the greatest tragedy would be a church that is not united. He had spent his life in serious study and prayer, looking for the truth and trying to know God more fully. He was zealous for the ways of his teachers and fathers and this zeal, although misguided, had enflamed the apostle with a desire to see the truth spread and the false teachings stamped out everywhere. This is why he led attacks on Christians and threw many into prisons. Because his zeal was misguided and ill-informed. One day, by the will and the grace of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ revealed Himself to St. Paul on the road to Damascus and this set off a chain of events that have rippled through time and completely changed the course of history. Paul became the apostle to the gentiles and spread the gospel of Jesus Christ far and wide. He had a new focus for all of his earlier zeal and love for God. Rather, God came into focus more clearly for him. Through the encounter with the risen Lord Jesus, Paul‚Äôs world was turned upside down. His life was now fully dedicated to teaching others about Christ and helping others encounter and know this messiah, this Son of God who could save mankind from their sins.

With all of this as a background, we see St. Paul undertaking major missionary journeys all over the known world and the Roman empire. He gave the rest of his life to this daunting and joyful task of bringing the news of what God had done for humanity through His Son Jesus to the whole world. He set up communities and spent time with them, loved them, prayed with them and encouraged them. He would then pick up and move to the next area to start the work again in a new place, to bring new souls to Christ. St. Paul would often hear news from these communities that he had started, some good, some not so good. And what St. Paul understood clearly was that there were a few things that could hurt, if not destroy a church community.

First, false teachings. Second, immorality. Third, dissension or division over smaller issues. This is the one that St. Paul is focused on in today‚Äôs reading. What was the issue that began to cause division for the Christians at Corinth? It was their baptismal lineage. Who had been baptized by whom? Some claimed their baptism was better because it was at the hands of Apollos, some at the hands of Cephas (Peter), some at the hands of Paul. And this rather trivial matter became a big issue that divided the people.

In our world there are always things that will divide us if we let them. Today we divide over political affiliation, the use of vaccines, the wearing of masks and who serves the most delicious cheeseburger. But we are reminded that to divide over trivial matters isn‚Äôt just bad manners, it is a serious sin. It is tearing the fabric of the body of Christ in two. Shredding a lovely, single garment made by the hands of God, into pieces. It is a sign of a deficiency in love towards Christ and His Church and towards those for whom Christ gave His life upon the tree of the cross.

My brothers and sisters, it should not be so. We should not be like the world around us, uncivil, ill-mannered, ill-tempered, easily provoked, easily offended. As Christians we are called to see Christ in every person and to love every member of the church with a godly love. The things that unite us in Christ are much greater than the trivial and childish things that cause us to separate from one another. And if we find that perhaps our opinions are too strong, too offensive, too harsh and polarizing, we can choose the path of humility instead of the path of prideful resistance. We can choose to be peacemakers. I believe that our Lord said something important about being peacemakers. Being the man or woman who works for peace with their fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, is more important than feeling right or justified in my opinions.

It should go without saying, that this is true even during coffee hour or when we are on social media. Not everyone does a good job of showing restraint and thinking about how their comments and opinions might serve to alienate or push away their fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. That we don‚Äôt think about others makes us more than negligent, it makes us selfish and self-centered. So we are all called to restrain ourselves and to think of others. That is how we love actively. That is how we honor Jesus Christ.

St. John of Kronstadt writes, ‚ÄúAs the Holy Trinity, our God is One Being, although Three Persons, so, likewise, we ourselves must be one. As our God is indivisible, we also must be indivisible, as though we were one man, one mind, one will, one heart, one goodness, without the smallest (mingling) of malice ‚Äì in a word, one pure love, as God is Love. ‚ÄúThat they may be one, even as We are One‚Äù (John 17:22).‚Äù He writes in another place ‚ÄúA Christian must always be kind, gracious, and wise in order to conquer evil by good.‚Äù Sometimes we are the ones being offended. Even then we are not let off the hook. We are commanded to forgive everyone so that we also might be forgiven.

My friends, let us work diligently for the salvation of our fellow brothers and sisters, every minute of every day, especially when we are here with this great extended family. Let us love and be ambassadors of Christ‚Äôs love just as the Lord first loved us and sacrificed Himself on our behalf. Let us not push others away carelessly, instead let us draw them further into Christ‚Äôs Church with the net of mercy and compassion, for this makes us shine with the radiance of the All- Merciful and compassionate God, the Lover of mankind. AMEN.

Spotify reports that in 2022 - 275,000 artists were added to editorial playlists. This number is close to the reporting revenue numbers from Spotify for 2022.

* Total creators sharing content: 10+ million
* Active artists (generated at least 10 monthly listeners): \~5 million
* Artists generating 95% of monthly streams: \~300,000

300.000 artist make 95% of the money. 275,000 make these high follow playlists. While this does not guarantee success, it does make an interesting argument for making one of the lists can help launch an artist in to a financially successful career.

Understand, nothing is a magic success bullet. You want to be in as many places as you can to get exposure to people who might like your music. If you can manages to get multiple exposures to those people your chances of gaining a fan increases.

The time spent building a full marketing plan and deployment calendar will pay off when you are planning new releases, because you'll understand better what worked for you and what didn't.

Understand that if you choose to only do digital marketing for your release you are competing with many different distractions that you do not control. Finding a captive audience minimizes the distractions - play lists give a higher captive audience percentage then any social media advertisement would - as those ads are outside of the current focus of the viewer at that time.

I really missed just being around other people, so I started working from coffee shops and other public spaces, which helped tremendously with my productivity and happiness. But finding good spots was always a challenge (we all know the frustration of setting up only to discover terrible wifi or no outlets). After lots of trial and error finding places that actually work for a solid morning session, I decided to build a platform to help find great places to work out of. Just wanted to share in case anyone else is feeling that WFH isolation or has the same challenges of finding good public places. Would love to hear your experiences too!

He was on his way home to me after we both had very long work weeks with overtime. We were texting up until the moment he decided to head home from the coffee shop he visited after work. He was almost home when the woman made the turn and hit him. 

He died at the scene, so I know it happened quickly, but I keep having these thoughts of him being absolutely terrified and heartbroken that he was going to die.

Yawning deeply, Jake rolled over. Opening his eyes felt like twisting the cap off a thing of superglue.

‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶ but it felt wrong ‚Äì like I wasn‚Äôt helping enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù Emmie said, encouraging the baby to latch in lieu of a bottle. ‚ÄúBut you must try. We can‚Äôt both be up all night every night‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll go mad!‚Äù

Jake smiled.

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù he yawned again, causing Emmie to yawn too.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs infectious!‚Äù she laughed quietly, stroking the baby‚Äôs head.

Pulling on a dressing gown, Jake stumbled down the stairs in his underpants.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù he yelped, pulling the parted gown together.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù she asked wryly.

*‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù*

She chuckled, an eyebrow raised, unable to tell whether he was joking or not. ‚ÄúYou and your sense of humour‚Ä¶ Coffee?‚Äù

She passed him a mug. Then another.

‚ÄúGo rest,‚Äù she smiled warmly. ‚ÄúTake that up.‚Äù

Back in the room, Jake passed Emmie her coffee. ‚ÄúWhen did my parents arrive?‚Äù he quizzed.

‚ÄúYesterday? The day before? Everything is‚Ä¶*blurry*,‚Äù she said, shrugging her shoulders.

‚ÄúWe should try to rest,‚Äù Jake said, trying not to sound concerned as he stared at the baby absentmindedly.

But every time he was about to drift off, the baby would fuss, gripe or bawl uncontrollably.

‚ÄúTeething‚Ä¶‚Äù Emmie groaned.

‚ÄúI need to do some work anyway,‚Äù Jake sighed.

This pattern went on for days. *Weeks*. Working from home was initially a blessing, but after a while it meant no respite from either world ‚Äì baby or meetings.

Nighttime was the worst. He began to actively dread it. The sun going down was a real trigger, as it meant another sleepless night was only hours away. He would become irascible. Difficult.

*‚ÄúMum!!‚Äù* He called one night, desperate for help.

‚ÄúShe left‚Ä¶days ago,‚Äù Emmie yawned, still half asleep.

He shook his head angrily, bouncing the baby up and down, up and down‚Ä¶

And then it was morning.

He panicked. His last memory was of holding the baby.

But worse. *There was blood on the covers,* in the space between him and Emmie.

*Nonononononono‚Ä¶*

He felt nauseous. Shaking violently, he delicately lifted the quilt up, where there was blood still pooling in black spots.

There, on the sheet, was a tangle of feathers and blood ‚Äì the visceral remains of a bird‚Ä¶ *But it was still moving.*

*How‚Ä¶?*

Hearing a flutter of wings, he pulled the sheet all the way off, revealing a baby bird that was pulling eagerly at the unfurled bowels of the bigger, dead bird ‚Äì and it squawked at him violently as Emmie came in, cradling nothing in her arms.

‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs up!‚Äù she fussed, bouncing and swaying as though she was holding something. The sound of overspilling bath water roared in the background.

‚ÄúBath time now.‚Äù

Then there's monkfruit chocolate like [brooklyn born](https://store.brooklynbornchocolate.com/Products/Keto-Dark-Chocolate-Lemon-Coffee-Bar\_\_LCKB.aspx) that's also 10% net carbs. I've heard tapioca starch can be an issue, though.

Or sugar-alcohol (erythritol) and inulin (chicory root) chocolate like [Lily's milk chocolate](https://www.lilys.com/products/lilys-creamy-milk-chocolate-style-bar-3-oz.html) at 13% net carbs, [Lily's extra dark](https://www.lilys.com/products/lilys-extra-dark-chocolate-style-bar-2-8-oz.html) at 8% net carbs, and [chocoperfection](https://www.chocoperfection.com/dark-chocolate-gift-box-p/7171.htm) which claims 4% net carbs.

I am mostly happy with the living room, I am not sure to do with the gym stuff hidden behind the sofa. Some crates and boxes maybe? I was also thinking of an Ivar unit against that wall, it looks nice when stained a darker colour

I think we have enough storage, but more wouldn't go amiss. I also like having the walls bare because the texture of the limewash is nice

In an ideal world I would have wood floors but I can't afford that and the furniture is in now so that's not coming out haha! Serendipitously the carpet works well with the furniture, I hated the carpet when I moved in. (Last photo)

The carpet is quite low pile, I was thinking about a burnt orange/salmon rug for the sofa/coffee table

The hallway we are planning on painting the same limewash colour for a start. The hallway opens directly at the bathroom which I don't like, but can't really do much beyond closing the door. Or maybe a curtain in front of it too to hide the door?

Would love to hear some outside influences!

","So, the worst of the triggers is the CSA which i will spoiler for safety. But the post will talk about physical assault aswell both historical and more recent. 

Honestly, its like i've been thrown through a loop recently. I've been doing well to process traumas with a therapist over 60hours worth of therapy sessions at least 40 of them around regulation/trauma processing etc the rest just keeping things going and learning how to safeguard against winter mood changes as i also have bipolar with seasonal affect. 

About 7 weeks ago i was grabbed by the neck by a patient and they also trapped me in a corner and aimed to punch me in the face. I did get out the room though i don't really remember how right now but i did. 

I have since had about 4 panic attacks at work due to feeling like things have gone wrong  being triggered by something someone has said i.e. one patient explained in detail how he was assaulted as a kid (11 yrs old). I was around a similar age when the most traumatic epiosde of CSA happened. 

My therapist asked me last week if i knew why the attack had set off these symptoms recently and i do know but i can't voice it, she knows vaguly what happened but not details and i just can't explain it verbally. I tend to go non-verbal when this triggered. But i can write things down to get things out and it helps somewhat. 

Detail is spoilered below. 

>!so i remember being pinned to a wall being assaulted around 10yrs old, felt a hand on the back of my neck, i remember the feeling of my head being held down and being forced to give oral (this appears to have happened multiple times at this age and later at 13/14  but i don't know how many as most of this is body memories, one was a boyfriend when i was around 13/14, i remember being scared and him forcing me to touch him and hold my head down by my neck!<

There is also something when i was around 21 i was living with a friend we both the same sex (female) and she became abusive and she used to hit me in the face for sleeping, once that i remember she tried to strangle me and then kicked me in the ribs as i was on the floor and she was enraged. 

Around the time i was 29 i went out for a coffee date with someone from work (worked on the same hospital site) we ended up at his flat in which he assaulted me and locked me in his flat with him, again i don't really remember all of it. 

Barely anyone really knows any of this apart from the thing that happened at work as it was witnessed by collegues.

I absoutely hate people touching my neck, i can't have it, my therapist also thinks i'm autistic which could be part of the issue aswell. 

I can't seem to ground, stop the flashbacks or panic attacks so i have been to my doctors to adjust my medications to see if this helps and i'm working with my therapist about the new symptoms i'm struggling with, i am practicing self care as much as i can. 

But i'm really questioning why i'm reacting so badly, if its all really worth it if i'm going to feel this bad forever. It feels like two years ago again where i was first diagnosed and its hard to go back there. I keep telling myself that we are in a better position now but its hard to believe it when i can feel everything happening to my body all over again and its affect sleep/eating/work. 

If anyone has any advise i would be greatful. Sorry for the long post i'm really struggling with everything.

1gk8r99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1gk8r99/how_we_can_get_a_alien_refresh/,How we can get a Alien refresh ,"Okay so this is going to be *massive* copium from me but stick with me. 

Aliens, Mermaids, plant sims, and (until recently) Ghosts just seemed so lame compared to the occults with skill trees. Cause they were. But now that Ghosts have a tree I‚Äôve started think about ways we could get refreshes for other occult sims. 

I think the most plausible answer is Aliens. Get to Work is the oldest sims 4 expansion, and it really shows its age. Outdated clothes, lack luster gameplay, really only 1 worthy active career, and a very boring occult. But that can be fixed with these simple steps. 

1. Add aliens to base game. It doesn‚Äôt have to include abductions, alien babies, Sixam, or even a bunch of alien items. Just a few clothing pieces and how the aliens are currently. 

2. Alien game pack. Release a gameplay pack that includes the expanded alien occult (skill tree, cas and bb items, maybe a new world). Make sure that these features don‚Äôt overlap with the get to work alien features, this should easy because there‚Äôs not much. Maybe even introduce a different alien type. Like you have sixam aliens and sevenam aliens; they hate each other and have different abilities. 

3. Get to work alien refresh. This part is important, because EA wants to ensure people will continue to buy the older packs. Add new alien bb or cas items, maybe throw in an update to sixam, and other minor fixes. Also add abilities or interaction that can only happen if you have both packs. Nothing crazy like with my first pet and Cats and Dogs where it‚Äôs literally unplayable without the other pack but something small like a sixam alien unlocking an ability to teleport to the sixam planet, which they can only do if they have the Get to Work pack. An update to sixam would be necessary, again it doesn‚Äôt have to be much! Put a merchant, new collectible, alien fight ring, literally any reason to want to visit it repeatedly. 

4. Okay this part is important, upon release *put Get to Work on sale*. In economics they teach us about the concept of ‚Äúwillingness to pay‚Äù. Everyone has a certain threshold they are willing to spend money on a product (for example a lot of are willing to $3 for a coffee but less of us would be less willing to pay $10 for the same coffee). They can have fun with this, like putting Get to Work on sale for 51%. ‚ÄúBut won‚Äôt they be losing money?‚Äù Honestly probably not. Let‚Äôs assume they put a stuff pack worth of updated content into Get to Work (a pack that has been on the market for almost 10 years). If they sell the pack for $20 they are still making back almost double they would be getting if they sold it separately. Plus the pack is so old they‚Äôve likely made back all their money and more off of it. So they‚Äôll only need to make back the money that went into making the updates, not the money that went into making the whole pack. 

The really important part is that they *have* to make buying the game pack alone worth it. The addition of owning Get to Work should enhance the experience, not make it unplayable without it! This will encourage people who don‚Äôt own it to buy it, rewarding those who already own it. 

Now do I *really* think EA would actually do this? Probably not. I think the disaster of Cats and Dogs and My First Pet Stuff has scared them away from releasing anything that would expand upon stuff in another pack. More importantly it relies on them giving back one of the few things people still buy Get to Work for. They could still do this if they want to just release a pack that introduces a new alien group that‚Äôs separate from the sixam aliens and better in every way, and if you have Get to Work you can also get the skill tree of this new alien group.

I was meant to have a second interview today. To not stress myself out I basically get in the area the interview is and sit and have coffee, I got there for 9, interview was at 1pm.

This isn't an issue because it was nice getting out the house and I use my phone to apply for jobs.

I get a phone call at 12, ""sorry they filled the job"". I would've been leaving by then to get there. 

I go home. I call a friend. They tell me I'm not trying and they managed to get a job? I was made redundant about a week ago.  I got a good pay out so I'm not worried about how quickly I get it (within reason). They've never been made redundant.

I complained about the wasted travel time, costs and cancelling last minute.

The call lasted about 30 minutes then they hung up on me. But it  was 30 minutes of ""you aren't trying and i managed to do this better than you despite not having a university degree"". I have another interview somewhere else tomorrow and friday. That shows i am trying.

I was expecting a 30 second ""aw that sucks, youll sort something"" then a normal conversation.

And now because I'm too autistic to read social cues I'm replaying the conversation in my head because I think I've done something wrong but I think my friends just infantalise me and think that I'm expecting a job to fall in my lap or for things to be sorted for me and im incapable of doing anything.

Another friend has just stopped responding to me, so maybe ive been going on about the job search too much, which i understand as i am treating it like a full time job at the moment. 

I don't know. I feel pretty lonely at the moment because I'm not around my coworkers and these are all my social interactions at the moment. And I'm in a city so I even tried to talk to the person at the checkout in asda and they just complained I wasn't using the self service. Even the cafe they kind of just grunted.

I start therapy next week but I've lost my routine, my friends are being mean and i dont feel ok spending money going out

# Chapter 09 ‚Äì Land

The cafeteria buzzed with energy as the crew of the Peregrina gathered around the long metal tables. The aroma of synthesized coffee and freshly prepared nutrient packs filled the air, mingling with the sound of laughter and lively conversations. It was Sunday, and everyone was celebrating their day off. Though I was still adjusting to feeling part of the group, I found myself easily sliding into the seat next to Gulliver, who was playfully recounting his latest training session.

‚Äú...and when I told the instructor he needed to apply more torque, he just looked at me like I was crazy!‚Äù Gulliver laughed, slapping his palm on the table. The others joined in the laughter, but it faded when Cirakari entered. Taking Sunday off required Cirakari's formal approval, and until we heard from her, the day‚Äôs plans were up in the air.

‚ÄúAlright, everyone, calm down,‚Äù she said, her voice firm and clear. ‚ÄúI have news.‚Äù

Everyone leaned in, eager to hear what the rest of the day would be like.

‚ÄúAs I mentioned before, I‚Äôve managed to secure a resupply mission to Vielovento,‚Äù she announced, with a hint of pride in her voice.

T√†i and I cheered, while Gulliver huffed. ‚ÄúHow can you celebrate work on a Sunday?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen the alternative is being stuck on a ship with drunks and stoners, a little outing on Sunday doesn‚Äôt sound so bad,‚Äù T√†i justified.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been frozen for 150 years to start colonizing Vielovento. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the surface is like,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúWhere are we landing?‚Äù Gulliver tried to share in the excitement.

‚ÄúZhynka, in Sucron,‚Äù Cirakari replied, sitting down with us and starting her meal.

‚ÄúLucky you, Fred,‚Äù T√†i continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right in the twilight zone, pleasant climate, well-developed and cosmopolitan city.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs if you‚Äôll be able to see any of those things, right?‚Äù Gulliver said, waving his fork dismissively. ‚ÄúWe will be working, not visiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do we need to land a military ship for a resupply run after all?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe have shuttles and haulers to do the heavy lifting. But we can use the lower deck to carry munitions and other dense materials. It is not efficient at all, but we are in need to get the Broodmother ready as soon as possible‚Äù Cirakari explained.

‚ÄúThis is like using a battle tank as a supply truck‚Äù I mocked.

Cirakari cleared her throat, cutting through the jovial atmosphere. ‚ÄúBefore we make our departure, we have work to do. We need to prepare the Peregrina for atmospheric flight. This means we need to place thermal blankets on the exposed tanks, retract the LANTR engine assembly, and store the radiator panels. Since this can only be done from the outside, get ready to spend a good few hours in a vacuum suit.‚Äù

Despite the light mood, two things were still bothering me. ‚ÄúDo you know anything about Alice and Dr. Xuefeng?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been released. Dr. Xuefeng is preparing to leave on the next shuttle. Alice is also likely getting ready to depart, as the Virgo is refueling with the last of Broodmother‚Äôs hydrogen,‚Äù Cirakari explained.

I got up from the table, leaving my plate half-finished. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to say goodbye to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember what I told you, Fred,‚Äù Cirakari said, raising her index finger like a tutor training a dog.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, Fred. It‚Äôs easier not to get attached to crews from other ships,‚Äù T√†i added. ‚ÄúEspecially after all this sabotage mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I just want to say goodbye,‚Äù I agreed. ‚ÄúDo you know their dorm addresses?‚Äù

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

The first person I looked for was Dr. Xuefeng. I searched the first dormitory, workshop, storeroom, reading room, and every corner I could think of. Unsuccessful, I decided to visit Alice next.

Navigating through the corridors of the Peregrina, I changed my speech at every turn. I had gone through more revisions and rehearsals of the dialogue than I could count.

I reached her door, hesitating for a moment. Taking a deep breath, I knocked. After a brief second, the door slid open, and there was Alice, looking as radiant as ever.

‚ÄúFred,‚Äù she said, seemingly surprised by my visit. ‚ÄúWhat brings you here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to talk,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMay I come in?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh,‚Äù she hesitated, shrugging. ‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

Her quarters were, unsurprisingly, almost identical to mine. The small space was cluttered with equipment, personal items, and tools, yet it was cozy.

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù she asked, crossing her arms, a hint of suspicion in her tone.

‚ÄúAbout everything,‚Äù I began, already veering off the script I‚Äôd created seconds ago. ‚ÄúThis little uncommitted flirting game of ours and the mess I got you into with this whole sabotage story.‚Äù

Alice‚Äôs brow furrowed, and she let out a soft sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Fred. Talking to a guy from the past had its charm at first,‚Äù she admitted, blushing slightly. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre in a military environment, we can‚Äôt act like teenagers.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou thought I was charming?‚Äù I said with a mischievous smile, trying to make a joke.

‚ÄúYeah, why else would I be flirting with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, you‚Äôre right. The reason I came here is to say goodbye.‚Äù

She looked away for a moment, puffing her cheeks as if she were about to burst. ‚ÄúDamn it, Fred,‚Äù she finally said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe for us to be close right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôve only known each other for a few days. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what my life will be like from now on. And to add to that, there‚Äôs this whole thing with the Overseers,‚Äù I said, moving a bit closer. ‚ÄúWhen this all blows over, let‚Äôs start over, the right way. What do you think?‚Äù

She leaned in and pressed her lips against mine. The kiss was gentle, hesitant, a fragile mix of confusion and longing as if, for just a moment, we could forget the world outside. Time held its breath, letting everything else‚Äîwar, chaos, uncertainty‚Äîfade into silence. A part of me wished it could last forever. But just as quickly, reality hit back. She pulled away from me, both of us blushing and awkward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good idea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I pulled her back to me, this time the kiss was the opposite of the first. Warm, long, and intense. ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd met you under better circumstances,‚Äù I said, regret in my voice.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she interrupted, stepping back as if the distance could somehow protect us from what we‚Äôd just shared.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just... keep our focus on the mission from now on.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúWe should get back to work. The crew will be waiting for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

We exchanged one last look, a shared understanding that this moment would remain just ours. With a heavy heart, I turned and left her quarters, knowing this fragile connection would have to remain unspoken.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

Back at the Broodmother‚Äôs anchorage, the crew was already immersed in preparing the Peregrina for landing. Cirakari directed operations with the sharp efficiency of a commander who had done this a thousand times before.

‚ÄúFred, you‚Äôre late,‚Äù she said, leaving no room for excuses. ‚ÄúYou and Gulliver will be responsible for the thermal blankets.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù I replied, hurrying to the suit storage area.

‚ÄúSo, did you find Dr. Xuefeng and Alice?‚Äù Gulliver asked as he helped me with the suit‚Äôs seals.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt find Dr. Xuefeng. I‚Äôve turned this ship upside-down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Alice?‚Äù His grin was visible even as he sealed his face behind the helmet.

I secured my own helmet, continuing the conversation through the radio. ‚ÄúYes, I did find her. I don‚Äôt want to talk about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs voice cut in, making me jump inside my suit. ‚ÄúBecause you are on an open channel and I‚Äôm expecting you to focus on your job.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry commander,‚Äù I replied.

We stepped out into the void, methodically anchoring lifelines from ring to ring until we reached the Peregrina‚Äôs tanks. Together, we worked to secure the thermal blankets over the exposed fuel tanks. The Peregrina‚Äôs armor could handle reentry with subsurface cooling, but the tanks needed reflective layers to keep the cryogenic contents stable. The catch was that this reflective surface would melt faster than ice in a furnace during atmospheric reentry. That‚Äôs where the blankets came in‚Äîdesigned as ablative shielding, they would sacrifice themselves layer by layer, carrying away the deadly heat.

‚ÄúMake sure to double-check those straps,‚Äù Gulliver instructed.

‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù I replied through the radio. The thick gloves were definitely a pain in the ass, but at least it was much better than the monstrosity I was used to back in the GIX. I knew this procedure from countless hours studying the Virgo‚Äôs manuals, but this was my first time putting theory into practice. ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù I announced finally.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done as well,‚Äù Gulliver echoed.

‚ÄúNice work guys,‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs voice carried approval. ‚ÄúFred, I need you to dismantle the laser reflector turrets. Gulliver, help me retract the LANTR engine cluster.‚Äù

Despite my expertise with engines making me the most qualified for that task, retracting the engines was mostly about pressing buttons and watching actuators do their thing. My assignment, however, was a different story. Loosening bolts, dismantling complex components, handling extremely sensitive fiberglass and mirrors‚Äîall while having to watch for floating nuts in zero-g. The job took longer than I‚Äôd like to admit, but eventually, both turrets were safely disassembled and stored.

‚ÄúWell done, Fred!‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs praise crackled through the radio.

‚ÄúCan I ask for a raise now?‚Äù I joked, flexing my tired fingers.

‚ÄúMaybe if you manage to finish the job before I turn into a grandma next time,‚Äù Cirakari shot back.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

With preparations complete, we assembled in the Peregrina‚Äôs control deck. Cirakari took her position at the helm. ‚ÄúBroodmother, this is Commander Cirakari from the Peregrina. I‚Äôll be handling the ship and therefore I‚Äôm entitling First Lieutenant Gulliver to speak on the Peregrina‚Äôs behalf, do you acknowledge?‚Äù

‚ÄúAcknowledged, Peregrina,‚Äù the Broodmother‚Äôs operator replied.

‚ÄúWe are ready to initiate undocking procedures. Requesting confirmation of authorization for separation,‚Äù Gulliver communicated as Cirakari‚Äôs hands moved over the maneuver controls.

‚ÄúUnderstood. Authorization granted. Confirm manual disengagement mode is activated.‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirmed. Manual disengagement mode activated. We will initiate lateral thrusters for controlled distancing to minimum safe distance,‚Äù Gulliver replied.

‚ÄúCopied, Peregrina. Move to 250 meters, then proceed with deorbit burn at your discretion. Atmospheric entry window for Zhynka‚Äôs landing pad opens in 22 minutes. Gravitational assist vectors will be sent in 5 seconds.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrajectory data received. Executing final vector alignment checks. Peregrina‚Äôs navigation and orientation systems are all green,‚Äù T√†i confirmed.

‚ÄúHeat exchangers prepared and nominal pressure. Radiators ready for retraction sequence,‚Äù I reported, fighting the knot in my throat and wiping my sweaty palms on my suit. I‚Äôd performed de-orbital flights before, but never in a military-grade armored brick powered by bomb-grade uranium for engines.

‚ÄúConfirming lateral separation in progress. Separation speed maintained at one-tenth meters per second,‚Äù Cirakari announced.

‚ÄúSeparation at one-tenth meters per second confirmed. Maintain clear lateral thrusters until reaching 150 meters.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopied, Broodmother. Moving to 150 meters, speed maintained,‚Äù Gulliver acknowledged.

‚ÄúT√†i, confirm portside frontal thruster vector is stable?‚Äù Cirakari requested.

‚ÄúConfirmed. Thrust is stable, monitoring residual vibrations,‚Äù T√†i responded.

‚ÄúSeparation verification at 150 meters... complete separation. Reorienting for deorbit trajectory,‚Äù Cirakari reported.

‚ÄúSeparation at 150 meters confirmed, good separation, Peregrina. Safe travels, and we‚Äôll see you soon,‚Äù Broodmother control concluded.

‚ÄúThank you, Broodmother. Initiating rotation for deorbit burn alignment,‚Äù Cirakari replied.

‚ÄúBroodmother clear, systems green. Aligned with Zhynka entry vector, confirming angle at -5.3 degrees,‚Äù T√†i reported, his voice steady despite the mounting tension.

‚ÄúExecuting deorbit burn in 5... 4... 3... 2... ignition,‚Äù Cirakari counted down.

The ship shuddered as the engines roared to life. ‚ÄúMain engine at eighty-five percent power. Heat levels within expected range, thermal shields stable,‚Äù I reported, frantically darting between the cooling system monitors.

‚ÄúAltitude at 210 kilometers,‚Äù Cirakari announced, her voice cutting through the engine‚Äôs rumble.

‚ÄúVelocity vector confirmed, 2.1 kilometers per second and decreasing,‚Äù T√†i said.

‚ÄúBurn complete,‚Äù Cirakari confirmed.

A knot formed on my throat as an alert flashed across my screen. ‚ÄúCommander, there was an anomaly on the heat-sink,‚Äù I reported, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúIts efficiency is three percent lower than expected.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we continue? It‚Äôs your call Fred,‚Äù Cirakari said.

*‚ÄúIn normal conditions, this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem,‚Äù*¬†I tried to reason.¬†*‚ÄúBut with the recent sabotage on the Virgo, could this also be a sabotage attempt?‚Äù*¬†The go-nogo window was closing fast‚Äîthere was no time for debate. ‚ÄúYes, we can continue.‚Äù

The external cameras displayed a mesmerizing, almost deadly layer of plasma wrapping around the ship as we plunged into the atmosphere. Less mesmerizing were the temperature gauges climbing at an alarming rate as the heat-sink‚Äôs efficiency continued to deteriorate.

‚ÄúCommander, we may have to use active cooling,‚Äù I announced, already fiddling with the emergency controls. ‚ÄúThe issue with the heat-sink is becoming a real problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúProceed, Fred.‚Äù

I activated the emergency protocols, and the external surfaces began weeping coolant fluid like a metal giant sweating in a furnace. We were losing all our fluids, yes, but the droplets would create a buffer separation layer between the ship‚Äôs surface and the plasma, turning to steam and carrying away the deadly heat.

‚ÄúIonization layer detected. Surface control communications may drop soon,‚Äù T√†i warned.

‚ÄúUnderstood. Everyone in position, prepare for peak G-forces,‚Äù Cirakari instructed.

The ship‚Äôs vibrations intensified, rattling every bolt and panel around us. Through the external cameras, we could see the hull glowing cherry-red as rivers of plasma carved their way around our reinforced shields.

‚ÄúHull temperature at 1350 degrees Celsius. Remaining within limits,‚Äù I reported, darting between multiple sensor displays. ‚ÄúG-force currently at 3.1 and rising.‚Äù The force pushed us deeper into our seats, making every movement feel like lifting weights.

‚ÄúSpeed reducing‚Äî3.8 kilometers per second,‚Äù T√†i announced.

As we pushed through the atmosphere‚Äôs denser layers, the ship groaned and shuddered like a living thing. ‚ÄúThermal load is decreasing. We‚Äôre out of the critical layer,‚Äù I informed, relief flooding through me as the readings began to stabilize. The violent vibrations gradually subsided to a more manageable rumble, though the constant force of deceleration still pressed us firmly into our seats.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

‚ÄúAltitude at 12 kilometers. Approaching final descent,‚Äù T√†i announced, his fingers moving across his console with renewed confidence.

‚ÄúActivating landing thrusters... now,‚Äù Cirakari declared. ‚ÄúSwitching from main engines to vertical descent profile.‚Äù

The Peregrina‚Äôs fission thrusters came to life with a controlled roar, providing the final kick to our landing burn. The timing had to be perfect‚Äîwe needed to activate the LANTR engines at the last possible moment to ensure their radioactive plume would be safely contained by the radiation bunker beneath the landing pad.

‚ÄúLanding hooks deployed, tower is ‚Äúgo‚Äù for catch. Power flow nominal,‚Äù T√†i informed.

With a grace that belied its massive bulk, the Peregrina settled onto the tower. The hooks were grabbed by the tower as a giant hug with a satisfying thud. For a moment, nobody spoke. We sat in our seats, the weight of planetary gravity settling over us like a heavy blanket.

Through the camera feeds, I could see the first hints of Zhynka‚Äôs skyline in the distance, a testament to humanity‚Äôs determination to build a home among the stars. The eternal twilight of Vielovento‚Äôs terminator zone painted everything in perpetual sunset colors, creating an alien yet somehow familiar landscape. After 150 years of frozen sleep, I had finally arrived at my destination‚Äîthough in a way I never could have imagined.",0,1730818116.0,redditserials,1,0.5,False

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù she asked, crossing her arms, a hint of suspicion in her tone.

‚ÄúAbout everything,‚Äù I began, already veering off the script I‚Äôd created seconds ago. ‚ÄúThis little uncommitted flirting game of ours and the mess I got you into with this whole sabotage story.‚Äù

Alice‚Äôs brow furrowed, and she let out a soft sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Fred. Talking to a guy from the past had its charm at first,‚Äù she admitted, blushing slightly. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre in a military environment, we can‚Äôt act like teenagers.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou thought I was charming?‚Äù I said with a mischievous smile, trying to make a joke.

‚ÄúYeah, why else would I be flirting with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, you‚Äôre right. The reason I came here is to say goodbye.‚Äù

She looked away for a moment, puffing her cheeks as if she were about to burst. ‚ÄúDamn it, Fred,‚Äù she finally said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe for us to be close right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôve only known each other for a few days. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what my life will be like from now on. And to add to that, there‚Äôs this whole thing with the Overseers,‚Äù I said, moving a bit closer. ‚ÄúWhen this all blows over, let‚Äôs start over, the right way. What do you think?‚Äù

She leaned in and pressed her lips against mine. The kiss was gentle, hesitant, a fragile mix of confusion and longing as if, for just a moment, we could forget the world outside. Time held its breath, letting everything else‚Äîwar, chaos, uncertainty‚Äîfade into silence. A part of me wished it could last forever. But just as quickly, reality hit back. She pulled away from me, both of us blushing and awkward. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good idea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I pulled her back to me, this time the kiss was the opposite of the first. Warm, long, and intense. ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd met you under better circumstances,‚Äù I said, regret in my voice.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she interrupted, stepping back as if the distance could somehow protect us from what we‚Äôd just shared.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just... keep our focus on the mission from now on.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúWe should get back to work. The crew will be waiting for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

We exchanged one last look, a shared understanding that this moment would remain just ours. With a heavy heart, I turned and left her quarters, knowing this fragile connection would have to remain unspoken.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

Back at the Broodmother‚Äôs anchorage, the crew was already immersed in preparing the Peregrina for landing. Cirakari directed operations with the sharp efficiency of a commander who had done this a thousand times before.

‚ÄúFred, you‚Äôre late,‚Äù she said, leaving no room for excuses. ‚ÄúYou and Gulliver will be responsible for the thermal blankets.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù I replied, hurrying to the suit storage area.

‚ÄúSo, did you find Dr. Xuefeng and Alice?‚Äù Gulliver asked as he helped me with the suit‚Äôs seals.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt find Dr. Xuefeng. I‚Äôve turned this ship upside-down.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Alice?‚Äù His grin was visible even as he sealed his face behind the helmet.

I secured my own helmet, continuing the conversation through the radio. ‚ÄúYes, I did find her. I don‚Äôt want to talk about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs voice cut in, making me jump inside my suit. ‚ÄúBecause you are on an open channel and I‚Äôm expecting you to focus on your job.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry commander,‚Äù I replied.

We stepped out into the void, methodically anchoring lifelines from ring to ring until we reached the Peregrina‚Äôs tanks. Together, we worked to secure the thermal blankets over the exposed fuel tanks. The Peregrina‚Äôs armor could handle reentry with subsurface cooling, but the tanks needed reflective layers to keep the cryogenic contents stable. The catch was that this reflective surface would melt faster than ice in a furnace during atmospheric reentry. That‚Äôs where the blankets came in‚Äîdesigned as ablative shielding, they would sacrifice themselves layer by layer, carrying away the deadly heat.

‚ÄúMake sure to double-check those straps,‚Äù Gulliver instructed.

‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù I replied through the radio. The thick gloves were definitely a pain in the ass, but at least it was much better than the monstrosity I was used to back in the GIX. I knew this procedure from countless hours studying the Virgo‚Äôs manuals, but this was my first time putting theory into practice. ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù I announced finally.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done as well,‚Äù Gulliver echoed.

‚ÄúNice work guys,‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs voice carried approval. ‚ÄúFred, I need you to dismantle the laser reflector turrets. Gulliver, help me retract the LANTR engine cluster.‚Äù

Despite my expertise with engines making me the most qualified for that task, retracting the engines was mostly about pressing buttons and watching actuators do their thing. My assignment, however, was a different story. Loosening bolts, dismantling complex components, handling extremely sensitive fiberglass and mirrors‚Äîall while having to watch for floating nuts in zero-g. The job took longer than I‚Äôd like to admit, but eventually, both turrets were safely disassembled and stored.

‚ÄúWell done, Fred!‚Äù Cirakari‚Äôs praise crackled through the radio.

‚ÄúCan I ask for a raise now?‚Äù I joked, flexing my tired fingers.

‚ÄúMaybe if you manage to finish the job before I turn into a grandma next time,‚Äù Cirakari shot back.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

With preparations complete, we assembled in the Peregrina‚Äôs control deck. Cirakari took her position at the helm. ‚ÄúBroodmother, this is Commander Cirakari from the Peregrina. I‚Äôll be handling the ship and therefore I‚Äôm entitling First Lieutenant Gulliver to speak on the Peregrina‚Äôs behalf, do you acknowledge?‚Äù

‚ÄúAcknowledged, Peregrina,‚Äù the Broodmother‚Äôs operator replied.

‚ÄúWe are ready to initiate undocking procedures. Requesting confirmation of authorization for separation,‚Äù Gulliver communicated as Cirakari‚Äôs hands moved over the maneuver controls.

‚ÄúUnderstood. Authorization granted. Confirm manual disengagement mode is activated.‚Äù

‚ÄúConfirmed. Manual disengagement mode activated. We will initiate lateral thrusters for controlled distancing to minimum safe distance,‚Äù Gulliver replied.

‚ÄúCopied, Peregrina. Move to 250 meters, then proceed with deorbit burn at your discretion. Atmospheric entry window for Zhynka‚Äôs landing pad opens in 22 minutes. Gravitational assist vectors will be sent in 5 seconds.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrajectory data received. Executing final vector alignment checks. Peregrina‚Äôs navigation and orientation systems are all green,‚Äù T√†i confirmed.

‚ÄúHeat exchangers prepared and nominal pressure. Radiators ready for retraction sequence,‚Äù I reported, fighting the knot in my throat and wiping my sweaty palms on my suit. I‚Äôd performed de-orbital flights before, but never in a military-grade armored brick powered by bomb-grade uranium for engines.

‚ÄúConfirming lateral separation in progress. Separation speed maintained at one-tenth meters per second,‚Äù Cirakari announced.

‚ÄúSeparation at one-tenth meters per second confirmed. Maintain clear lateral thrusters until reaching 150 meters.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopied, Broodmother. Moving to 150 meters, speed maintained,‚Äù Gulliver acknowledged.

‚ÄúT√†i, confirm portside frontal thruster vector is stable?‚Äù Cirakari requested.

‚ÄúConfirmed. Thrust is stable, monitoring residual vibrations,‚Äù T√†i responded.

‚ÄúSeparation verification at 150 meters... complete separation. Reorienting for deorbit trajectory,‚Äù Cirakari reported.

‚ÄúSeparation at 150 meters confirmed, good separation, Peregrina. Safe travels, and we‚Äôll see you soon,‚Äù Broodmother control concluded.

‚ÄúThank you, Broodmother. Initiating rotation for deorbit burn alignment,‚Äù Cirakari replied.

‚ÄúBroodmother clear, systems green. Aligned with Zhynka entry vector, confirming angle at -5.3 degrees,‚Äù T√†i reported, his voice steady despite the mounting tension.

‚ÄúExecuting deorbit burn in 5... 4... 3... 2... ignition,‚Äù Cirakari counted down.

The ship shuddered as the engines roared to life. ‚ÄúMain engine at eighty-five percent power. Heat levels within expected range, thermal shields stable,‚Äù I reported, frantically darting between the cooling system monitors.

‚ÄúAltitude at 210 kilometers,‚Äù Cirakari announced, her voice cutting through the engine‚Äôs rumble.

‚ÄúVelocity vector confirmed, 2.1 kilometers per second and decreasing,‚Äù T√†i said.

‚ÄúBurn complete,‚Äù Cirakari confirmed.

A knot formed on my throat as an alert flashed across my screen. ‚ÄúCommander, there was an anomaly on the heat-sink,‚Äù I reported, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúIts efficiency is three percent lower than expected.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we continue? It‚Äôs your call Fred,‚Äù Cirakari said.

*‚ÄúIn normal conditions, this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem,‚Äù* I tried to reason. *‚ÄúBut with the recent sabotage on the Virgo, could this also be a sabotage attempt?‚Äù* The go-nogo window was closing fast‚Äîthere was no time for debate. ‚ÄúYes, we can continue.‚Äù

The external cameras displayed a mesmerizing, almost deadly layer of plasma wrapping around the ship as we plunged into the atmosphere. Less mesmerizing were the temperature gauges climbing at an alarming rate as the heat-sink‚Äôs efficiency continued to deteriorate.

‚ÄúCommander, we may have to use active cooling,‚Äù I announced, already fiddling with the emergency controls. ‚ÄúThe issue with the heat-sink is becoming a real problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúProceed, Fred.‚Äù

I activated the emergency protocols, and the external surfaces began weeping coolant fluid like a metal giant sweating in a furnace. We were losing all our fluids, yes, but the droplets would create a buffer separation layer between the ship‚Äôs surface and the plasma, turning to steam and carrying away the deadly heat.

‚ÄúIonization layer detected. Surface control communications may drop soon,‚Äù T√†i warned.

‚ÄúUnderstood. Everyone in position, prepare for peak G-forces,‚Äù Cirakari instructed.

The ship‚Äôs vibrations intensified, rattling every bolt and panel around us. Through the external cameras, we could see the hull glowing cherry-red as rivers of plasma carved their way around our reinforced shields.

‚ÄúHull temperature at 1350 degrees Celsius. Remaining within limits,‚Äù I reported, darting between multiple sensor displays. ‚ÄúG-force currently at 3.1 and rising.‚Äù The force pushed us deeper into our seats, making every movement feel like lifting weights.

‚ÄúSpeed reducing‚Äî3.8 kilometers per second,‚Äù T√†i announced.

As we pushed through the atmosphere‚Äôs denser layers, the ship groaned and shuddered like a living thing. ‚ÄúThermal load is decreasing. We‚Äôre out of the critical layer,‚Äù I informed, relief flooding through me as the readings began to stabilize. The violent vibrations gradually subsided to a more manageable rumble, though the constant force of deceleration still pressed us firmly into our seats.

‚úπ‚ú∏‚ú∂‚ú∏‚úπ

‚ÄúAltitude at 12 kilometers. Approaching final descent,‚Äù T√†i announced, his fingers moving across his console with renewed confidence.

‚ÄúActivating landing thrusters... now,‚Äù Cirakari declared. ‚ÄúSwitching from main engines to vertical descent profile.‚Äù

The Peregrina‚Äôs fission thrusters came to life with a controlled roar, providing the final kick to our landing burn. The timing had to be perfect‚Äîwe needed to activate the LANTR engines at the last possible moment to ensure their radioactive plume would be safely contained by the radiation bunker beneath the landing pad.

‚ÄúLanding hooks deployed, tower is ‚Äúgo‚Äù for catch. Power flow nominal,‚Äù T√†i informed.

With a grace that belied its massive bulk, the Peregrina settled onto the tower. The hooks were grabbed by the tower as a giant hug with a satisfying thud. For a moment, nobody spoke. We sat in our seats, the weight of planetary gravity settling over us like a heavy blanket.

Through the camera feeds, I could see the first hints of Zhynka‚Äôs skyline in the distance, a testament to humanity‚Äôs determination to build a home among the stars. The eternal twilight of Vielovento‚Äôs terminator zone painted everything in perpetual sunset colors, creating an alien yet somehow familiar landscape.

1gk8851,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gk8851/my_couch_is_breathing/,My couch is breathing ,"I promise you, I‚Äôm not crazy. I‚Äôve seen it with my own two eyes - my living room couch is breathing. The cushions pulsate rhythmically, expanding and contracting as if a pair of unseen lungs lie just beneath the fabric. I sat there staring at it for 3 hours this morning, trying to convince myself it was just a trick of the light, a quirk in my vision, anything other than what it seemed. I got up and made myself a fresh, piping hot cup of coffee, but by the time I took my first sip, it‚Äôd gone stone cold, as if hours had slipped by in mere seconds. My eyeballs felt as if they were on fire. I had to force myself to blink, alleviating the stinging. For what seemed to be the 100th time, I rubbed my eyes. Didn‚Äôt work. My goddamn couch was still breathing.

How could a couch be breathing? It's just a piece of furniture‚Äîan auburn lump stained with the remnants of last month's dinner. I knelt down to the level of the couch, my knees hitting the floor with a soft thud. Putting my hand on the surface, I almost expected it to feel warm, alive, almost. But of course not. It‚Äôs a couch. The leathery surface was cool to the touch, but unmistakably throbbing. My couch is breathing.

I wrote an email to the furniture company that day. *I know it‚Äôs been 4 years since I bought it*, I said. *But I‚Äôd like a refund. The couch is breathing.* I never did hear back from them. I made up my mind to give them a 1 star rating on their website.

I got up from my desk, softly shutting my laptop. Venturing over to my kitchen for a cup of coffee, I stop dead in my tracks as I pass the living room. My couch looked odd. It almost looked as though it was‚Ä¶breathing?

I stepped closer. Yep, it was *definitely* breathing. It made no sense. It was a couch, how could it be breathing? If I strained my ears, I could almost hear it, too - soft, wheezing breaths. It made no sense. Nothing makes much sense to me lately. I need coffee. Where did my coffee go? I was just drinking it.

I woke up this morning with a start, 2 hours before my alarm went off. I have these nightmares, you see. Terrible nightmares. Horrifying ones. Ones in which I‚Äôve committed crimes so heinous, it makes me disgusted to think my brain could come up with stuff like that. I was sweating, and my head was throbbing. Coffee would fix this. I should make myself some coffee. I really love coffee.

I stood there in my living room, steaming mug of coffee in my hand, which was strange because I didn‚Äôt remember making it, and I don‚Äôt like coffee that much anyways. My eyes flickered back to the couch in my living room. It was still brown. Still stained. Still breathing. I took a sip of the disgusting coffee, only to spit the mouthful back into the cup, because the coffee was now ice cold. I placed the mug on a table, and walked over to the couch. Plopping down on the worn out, brown leather, I let my body sway up and down, gently, with the breathing of the couch. There was a red stain. It seemed bigger than it was the last time I saw it. It was growing. And the couch was breathing.

My phone buzzed with a notification. It was the furniture company. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received your complaint,"" it read, the words cold and clinical. Strange. I don‚Äôt remember making any complaints.

But that wasn‚Äôt the disturbing part. Beneath the message was an image‚Äîa photo of me, sitting on the couch, staring blankly ahead with my hand pressed to the cushion. The angle was odd, slightly off, like it was taken from the corner of the room. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone. No one had been here. I was sure of it. It was just me and this couch. It was just us.

My pulse quickened. I glanced around the room, half-expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows, watching me. But it was just me‚Äîand the couch. Me and the couch. The couch and I. Just us.

Slowly, I looked back at the couch. The red stain had spread, darkening, seeping further into the fabric. I reached out, half dazed, and touched the stain. My fingers came away damp, and I stood up with a start, wiping my hand on my jeans. It felt sticky, almost warm. I shook my head, trying to clear the fog, but the details kept slipping, as if my mind was fighting to keep things in place.

I think I just need some coffee to clear my head.

In the kitchen, I hear my phone ring in my pocket. The water boiled on in the kettle, and I picked up the call on the 3rd ring. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. \[Me\], this is Detective \[Detective\] from the police department. We'd like you to come down to the station for a few questions regarding an ongoing investigation. It‚Äôs important we speak with you as soon as possible.‚Äù

That‚Äôs funny. Why was the furniture company calling me?

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ yes, of course,‚Äù I stammered, trying to clear my throat, my mind still muddled. ‚ÄúDid you say‚Ä¶ the police department?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mr. \[Me\]. The station‚Äôs address is in the email we sent you. We expect you here in the next hour,‚Äù the voice said, with an odd, almost mechanical precision. There was a pause, and then, in a quieter tone, the detective added, ‚ÄúAnd please, don‚Äôt try to clean anything.‚Äù

The line went dead.

I poured the boiling water from the kettle into a mug. I took a sip, grimacing as I realized it tasted metallic, and thicker than it should. Don‚Äôt try to clean anything?

I walked back into the living room. My head was spinning, and I wanted nothing more than to take a nap on my couch that is definitely not breathing and not blood-stained and not alive and ready for me to nap on.

Huh. Is my couch‚Ä¶breathing?

There‚Äôs a red stain on it I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. I don‚Äôt know how I never noticed it, because not only does it take up half the couch, it‚Äôs also still damp. A fresh wave of nausea rolled over me. I don‚Äôt remember spilling anything. I don‚Äôt remember anything that would leave a stain like that. And yet, here it was, spreading, like a living thing, taking over the fabric inch by inch.

Gingerly, hands shaking, I reach out for the zipper on the cushion cover. Pulling it backwards, I reveal an eyeball. It blinks, and I can hear knocking on my front door, but I can‚Äôt get myself to go open it because the more I unzip, the more of the face I uncover. It blinks. Morse code. Since when do I understand morse code?

.. - --- .-.. -.. -.-- --- ..- -. --- - - --- - .-. -.-- - --- -.-. .-.. . .- -. .- -. -.-- - .... .. -. --. ¬∑-¬∑-¬∑-

*I told you not to try to clean anything*, the eye says, silently.

The knocking at the door turned into pounding, and I could hear a muffled voice calling my name. I tried to call out, but my throat closed up, as if something was squeezing it from the inside. The eye slowly turned bloodshot. I was vaguely aware of the red stain growing onto my jeans.

‚ÄúMr. Me!‚Äù came a muffled voice from the door‚Äîa different voice now, deeper, angrier, as if whoever was outside was about to break the door down. ‚ÄúWe need to talk to you about your couch's extended warranty!‚Äù

God, my head hurts. I need some coffee. I wish my wife was still around. She made the best coffee. Too bad she‚Äôs couch. I mean, dead. Too bad she‚Äôs dead.

I open the door. Its a policeman standing there, but I can tell he‚Äôs really from the furniture police. His clothes don‚Äôt fool me.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I plead, turning my mug over and letting the coffee spill down at his feet. ‚ÄúMy couch is breathing. You have to help me.‚Äù

The furniture couch police man tilted his head, studying me with a strange, detached look. I caught a glimpse of his badge. It didn‚Äôt say *Police Department*. Instead, it read *Customer Compliance*. Beneath it, in smaller print, was the company‚Äôs name: *Furniture Solutions, Inc.* I felt a cold sweat break over me.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù he said, his voice calm and measured, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve received several reports of unusual maintenance issues. Now, if you‚Äôll just let me in, I‚Äôll have a look at the couch.‚Äù

I wanted to protest, to tell him that this wasn‚Äôt a maintenance issue, that I needed real help‚Äînot a corporate lackey. But when I opened my mouth, the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Instead, I just stepped back, allowing him in.

He walked over to the couch and ran his fingers over the cushions, tracing the lines where the stain had spread. He leaned in close, inspecting it, and then‚Äîhe pressed his ear to the fabric. My stomach lurched as he nodded, as if he could hear something I couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs breathing all right,‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúClassic case. You should‚Äôve called us sooner.‚Äù

‚ÄúClassic case?‚Äù I repeated, my voice cracking.

‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù he said, straightening up. ‚ÄúSay, you don‚Äôt suppose I could have a cup of coffee while I‚Äôm here, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI..‚Äù I looked up at him. It hurt to swallow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any coffee, sorry. Never buy it, don‚Äôt like the stuff.‚Äù

Looking visibly disappointed, he reached into his jacket and pulled out a scalpel. With a practiced motion, he began to cut along the edge of the cushion. The fabric peeled away, revealing something soft and pink and disturbingly alive beneath.

‚ÄúHoney?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt feel the words in my throat, but the voice saying them was unmistakably mine. ‚ÄúOh *darling*, I missed you so much.‚Äù

I knelt down to peel the strip of black duct tape off of her lips. I noticed her wrists were raw from the rope that bound them together. I loved her so much. I almost felt as if her wrists were mine, I felt my own wrists being bound together now. That‚Äôs how strong our bond was.

Her eyes were still closed. Taking a nap, I presumed. After all, it was a very comfortable couch.

I‚Äôm gonna make her a cup of coffee for when she wakes up. Then, I can tell her all about how I was so tired this morning, I almost thought the couch was breathing.",4,1730817686.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

I've tried to add images but it won't let me :( You can see the same review with pictures over at Head-fi: [https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-moca.27680/reviews#review-36091](https://www.head-fi.org/showcase/moondrop-moca.27680/reviews#review-36091)  
  
**YouTube Review Link & Methodology Summary:**

[**https://youtu.be/Q8\_2NCNSAlc**](https://youtu.be/Q8_2NCNSAlc)  
  
If you recognise me from this sub or more YouTube, you'll know that all of my reviews contain binaural sound and ANC samples, as well as frequency response measurements. These review elements, I hope, add a layer of objectivity to the key aspects of the review alongside my own subjective thoughts. 

**INTRO**

Until now, Moondrop haven't quite yet been able to emulate their success in the IEM market into their TWS offerings, with their high-profile releases, including the Space Travel and Ultrasonic, showing both their strengths and weaknesses in a product and price segment that has recently been dominated by tech manufacturers branching away from their core business of mobile phones (Realme, Oppo, OnePlus, etc) or those original wireless players that have churned out dozens more releases and have perhaps had more opportunity to hone their craft, notably SoundPEATS, Soundcore and QCY.  
  
Despite the Space Travel being an unprecedented success, with textbook tuning brought to a sub $25 set, more discerning buyers lamented their low maximum volume, connectivity issues, weak ANC, disappointing battery life and difficulty disconnecting from devices, not to mention the open charge case that divided opinion and ropey app support that disappeared as quickly as it arrived.  
  
2024 has been a prolific year for Moondrop, with the Golden Ages, Block and Ultrasonic all arriving over the last few months, all demonstrating gradual signs of improvement, but none have been able to address the issue of bringing strong, hybrid ANC without compromising audio integrity. Their latest attempt, the Moca, doesn't just set out to do that, it also brings some really nice innovations you don't always see at this price ($50), including photo-sensors for both wear detection and automatic transparency mode upon single earbud removal, a modified duct design to lessen the impact of wind, wireless charging, customisable controls and support for LE audio courtesy of the LC3 codec, not to mention the promise of great audio with the same drivers used here as those in the Aria 2.

**Design, Fit and Comfort**  
Moondrop seem to have a very set design brief, with the earbuds and case both looking very familiar alongside their brothers and sisters! The case, while somewhat Soviet-bloc inspired in its aesthetics, now includes a proper lid with good hinge friction, though those with larger fingers might find bud extraction slightly cramped.

  
The case has a handy 'Quick disconnect' via button on the bottom, which compensates to a degree for the lack of multipoint connectivity - a notable omission and possibly a deal-breaker for some users. It is charged either wirelessly or via a USB-C port located alongside the red button.

The Moca maintains Moondrop's typical stem-based design, with an almost-identical stem length to the Block and Ultrasonic before it. It looks and feels a bit bulky and cumbersome compared to the sleeker, more slimline offerings from the likes of OnePlus, Soundpeats and QCY.  
The slightly oval-shaped tips should provide a satisfactory seal for most users, though some adjustment may be needed periodically for optimal fit. Stability testing showed excellent results, passing the 100 jumping jacks test easily. However, running performance was mixed, with occasional popping sounds in my left ear, due to the size of my ear canal on that ear being slightly too small for the Medium tips, but slightly too big for the Small size. The standardized nozzle size does at least allow for third-party tip compatibility (unlike the oversized nozzles on the likes of Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, for example) but I haven't found any yet that improve upon the stock.  
  
**ANC & Transparency**  
  
The Moca features improved hybrid ANC using both feed-forward and feedback microphones, plus an acoustic duct for better wind noise handling. It definitely shows, with the Moca working well in both commuting and every-day busy indoor environments. Subjectively, it is very quickly evident that they've souped up the ANC strength, and obectively, testing showed over 30% improvement in noise reduction compared to the Ultrasonic, placing it in the top 10 of sub-$100 ANC performance.

It performs particularly well in lower frequencies, and whilst mid-range performance is slightly behind competitors like the Earfun Air 2 NC or Air Pro 4, it was better than I expected and still very credible.  
  
I tested the ANC along with a few competitor products, using binaural simulated ears in a busy coffee shop, and recorded the following average noise reduction figures:  
  
KZ Xtra - 36dB  
**Moondrop Moca - 31dB**  
Earfun Air 2NC - 31 dB  
QCY MeloBuds Pro - 30dB  
KZ Carol - 29dB  
Moondrop Ultrasonic/Space Travel - 24dB  
  
You've got some control over ANC in the app, although not a lot. You can modify the order through which modes are toggled, removing ANC off if you'd rather just keep ANC on and Transparency. There's no strength settings or mode customization, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're usage is fairly routine. There's no adaptive mode, which is a shame.  
  
Transparency mode, while natural-sounding, struggles with detailed reproduction of nearby conversations compared to some competitors, and the lack of obvious venting means you don't get that automatic open feeling that the likes of Apple's Airpod Pro 2 is so majestic at achieving,  
  
**Sound**  
  
The Moca uses the same 10mm ceramic dome diaphragm dynamic drivers as the Aria 2, and it delivers a balanced and musical presentation that not only improves upon the Space Travel, but is amongst the most enjoyable of the 80+ sub $100 sets I've tested over the last five years.

Key audio characteristics include:  


* Less emphasis on bass compared to typical budget TWS
* Fast, punchy, and detailed bass texture
* Clean mid-range with minimal bass bleed. Good detail and resonance to instruments.
* Natural vocal presentation, although deeper male vocals could have more body
* Good soundstage width - improvement over both MST and Ultrasonic
* Low distortion throughout the frequency range
* Smooth but detailed treble that offers enough texture to percussion without fatigue
* Slight EQ shift with ANC off, adding energy to vocals

Overall, it's an enjoyable listen with a balanced profile and natural tonality, but if you're used to budget TWS then you might find the bass lacking a little authority. Don't fear - the app includes bass presets (Ultra Bass and Solis Bass) that should satisfy those wanting more low-end emphasis, without detracting too much from the tonal balance that the Moca sets out. Sadly, there's no custom EQ, but all of the presets are usable.

In the budget TWS segment, the Moca ranks as one of the best-performing single-driver options, not too far short of the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE. You can see my full league table, including scoring, in the YouTube review.

  
**vs Moondrop Space Travel**

The Moca are a marked improvement over the Space Travel in both soundstage and imaging, with more precise instrument placement and separation. Technically, the driver performance is better too, with lower distortion, particularly in the lower frequencies. The bass is faster and transients through the frequency range are clean. The Space Travel were a great set for the price, and some users might still find their dynamics preferable to the more reference-sounding approach of the default Moca tuning. The Solis Bass preset gets very close, without detracting from the improved driver performance.  
  
**vs Ultrasonic**

The Ultrasonic sits between Space Travel's warmth and Moca's neutral reference sound. Ultrasonic offers more shimmery percussion, due to its balanced armature driver, while maintaining good tonality. The Ultrasonic edges out slightly in technical capability, and it's tangible with instruments such as pianos where the strikes are more palpable, but the Moca are a bit more versatile, sounding less congested with lower-mid-centric genres.  
  
**Controls & Wear Detection**

The control system offers some customization through the app, though the implementation is somewhat counterintuitive, applying 'gestures to actions' rather than the more common approach of 'actions to gestures'. Notable omission is the inability to control volume through touch controls.

The novel inclusion of photo sensors enables wear detection, automatically pausing playback and activating transparency mode when a bud is removed. While generally effective, it occasionally defaults to ANC off instead of transparency when no audio is playing, and doesn't automatically reactivate ANC when reinserting the bud. I did also have the odd issue where the bud forgets the EQ preset or last-selected ANC status after replacing and then removing from the case. Some additional customisation over wear detection in the app, as opposed to just 'on' or 'off', would have been welcome.  
  
**Battery Life**  
  
With the AAC codec, ANC on and making several calls, I got just short of 5.5 hours playtime, and around 6.5 hours with ANC off. However, having since noticed the bug that means removing one bud with no music playing seems to switch ANC off rather than initiating transparency, I may have to re-test this to make sure that figure is accurate, but either way, it's a significant improvement over the Space Travel, which delivered, at times, as low as 3 hours.  
  
The case offers an additional 2-2.5 full charges and takes around 2 hours, a bit longer using the wireless charging feature. There's an LED on the case that denotes charging progress and status, which is handy. The lack of quick charge, however, is a bit of a shame, especially since many cheaper buds offer this convenient feature.  
  
**Call Quality**  
  
Call performance remains a weakness, typical of budget TWS. Like all of those that don't use bone conduction mics for your voice (such as those used by Samsung and Huawei in their flagship models), the MEMS mic and AI ENC algorithm setup struggles to distinguish your own voice from environmental noise, particularly evident in busy scenes, resulting in muffled voice transmission while still allowing some background noise through. Whilst the Moca did well enough in the 'daily commute' test that you can hear in the YouTube review, it struggled in the coffee shop and outdoor market scenes, for the reasons outlined above.  
  
**Other Features**

* High/low gain options for volume adjustment - very welcome. It means I can now hear every word of even poorly recorded podcasts while commuting, something you couldn't always do with the Space Travel.
* \~200ms real-world latency (with Gaming Mode selected) is suitable for video but not for any sort of competitive gaming
* The Moondrop companion app support is welcome, and it does the basics well with potential for future firmware releases.

**Headline Potential Drawbacks/Deal-Breakers**

* Transparency mode could be cleaner and clearer
* No multipoint connectivity
* Limited and confusing control customization
* No quick charge capability
* I didn't test LC3, but if it is the same as the Ultrasonic then avoid it. Couldn't get the mic to work consistently using this mode, and the implementation is weird
* No certified IPX rating

**Summary**  
  
You've got to give Moondrop some credit for clearly reading and listening to feedback on their previous releases, and addressing them quickly with the Moca. It successfully delivers powerful ANC and maintains Moondrop's reputation for acoustic performance, and at a competitive price. The higher volume, wear detection and wireless charging were all noted as shortcomings on previous releases and have all been added into this competitively-priced release, which also gives solid battery performance and a case lid that many users were pining for!

Some may lament the absence of multipoint, inability to adjust volume using the touch controls, mediocre call performance and latency, not to mention the unoriginal and dull design, but if these aspects aren't important to you and you're in the market for a sub $50 set, the Moca stand toe-to-toe, and even stand out from an audio perspective, against the other most impressive performers - the likes of QCY MeloBuds Pro, Earfun Air 2NC, SoundPEATS Air4 Pro and FIIL Key Pro.  


*This is not a paid or brand-affiliated review. I do this as a hobby and buy the overwhelming majority of sets I review both on Headfi and on YouTube. Moondrop did send me the Moca (and Ultrasonic) for free, but there was no creative input into this review, no payment in exchange for the review and no terms imposed upon me, and like all of the other brands I've reviewed over the years, I've bought many of their products out of my own pocket, including the Space Travel, Chu, Chu 2 and Aria 2 and continue to buy product even though I could get it for free, partly to support the brands and do my bit towards encouraging innovation and partly to reinforce perceptions of my objectivity. Transparency is very important to me as a reviewer, if you don't have ethics you have nothing.*

""Were it not God's Will, we would not have given over Moscow.""

""Huh? Why the paysage, Michael?"" I'll tell you. We'll spend some time discussing some more conceptual and historical topics related to speculation over Keith's memes before we get into the options data and technicals. You can skip down to that stuff as usual if the symbolic discussion isn't your cup of tea.

Now. On with the show.

**Preamble**

Once again I see a lot of hype about November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, Keith's meme tin foil, and V for Vendetta. I saw a lot of this last week as well and I specifically cautioned not to get too wrapped up in this euphoria. Could something happen today? Sure, something \*could\* happen in this respect. Something \*can\* always happen, if we're talking about an unforeseen externality that disrupts our complex system equilibrium and causes hedging algorithms to dogpile calls and pump the price.

But that's not an operative question or, at least, not a maximally operative question. The correct questions, given the nature of risk by definition, are questions of probability. Is it \*probable\* that some major event with respect to the Stonk occurs today?

If we're using the same internal logic (pattern discernment and extension formula) with respect to Keith's V for Vendetta memes, then we ought to pay attention \*closely\* before running away with euphoric 'MOASS TODAY' interpretations. Many have pointed to the 'Overture' scene from V for Vendetta. You know, this one:

https://preview.redd.it/7sqpwhmyy2zd1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3d22c44f069a69fecfff1768a9ec8e355c86ad3

In this scene, shortly before an explosion and fireworks, Hugo Weaving begins to conduct an 'Overture.' Except, Natalie Portman can't hear anything...

[This is how she should have looked when Hayden Christiansen busted out that 'Sand' line in Attack of the Clones](https://preview.redd.it/ozmb1gi7z2zd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32fec330aa8d3edf2c371e3e22b53ffde59fb571)

Only after a significant interlude of silence does the final sequence of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture start blasting over the loudspeakers and thereafter do things start exploding. Even within this scene is there another layer of symbolism to the choice of music.

Yes, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture is often played during American fireworks displays. But the actual piece was commissioned the Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Savior in 1880 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Battle of Borodino (1812), the largest battle in recorded history up to that point fought between the Russian Imperial Army and Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e on the outskirts of Moscow during Napoleon's ill-fated Russian campaign of 1812-1813.

Yeah, Borodino! Fireworks and celebration for the Russians, right?

Lol yeah.... except, no. Napoleon won the Battle of Borodino. Perhaps not as much as KsiƒÖdz J√≥zef Poniatowski, Marshall and Commander of Napoleon's Polish Legions and the entire Left Flank at the battle, would have liked, but nonetheless the Grande Arm√©e drove the Russian army from the field and Napoleon occupied Moscow where, either strategically or accidentally, the city was engulfed in flames and burned to the ground.

[Oh...](https://preview.redd.it/w76rwoai13zd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2062a7739fddaca967bb9ee96954e94381a4e54)

There, Napoleon waited for Tsar Alexander I to send emissaries accepting terms of surrender just like he had forced on the Austrians in 1797 at Klagenfurt, on the Russians and Austrians in 1806 at Austerlitz, and on the Prussians in 1807 at Jena. He waited... and waited....

... and waited...

Until it became clear to him that Alexander would send no emissary from St. Petersburg and, with Moscow burned to ground and eaten out of all of its food in three months by Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e he would need to beat a hasty retreat back across Russia to the friendly Duchy of Warsaw in order to avoid starvation, encirclement, and capture by a regrouped, reformed, and well-fed Russian army the following Spring. The retreat back across Russia and Belarus that Autumn - beginning on 19 October, but remembered for the 'winter' blizzard on 6 November that resulted the death of nearly the entirety of the Grande Arm√©e - saw the death of a majority of the veterans of Napoleon's two decades of campaigns dating all the way back to his first investment of the British naval garrison of Toulon castle-prison. The campaign cost Napoleon nearly half a million soldiers. Losses unheard of in the history of the pre-industrial world.

The battle, although a tactical victory for Napoleon was a strategic victory for Russia and the Allies, who later met Napoleon at Leipzig the following year and soundly destroyed a new Grande Arm√©e at the Battle of the Nations, condemning Napoleon to his fate at Elba.

Yes, all of that was commemorated in Tchaikovsky 1812 Overture.

So what does this have to do with Keith's memes?

Well, maybe it lines up perfectly with that whole Kansas City Shuffle business. Napoleon's victory at Borodino ended up being the Kansas City Shuffle that crucially turned the tide against *l'Empereur*. Or maybe Keith didn't think about the harmony of that symbolism with the stuff he already posted, despite how apropos of his body of work the historical parallel seems to be.

The point is this: no matter how deep into tinfoil you get here, if something is brewing I'm seeing nothing on any of these layers of symbolic hints that say TODAY the price will explode.

Now. Let's see what our data says.

**Price Movement Recap**

[Trading Day 11\/4 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ut06xjq7r2zd1.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=9445a701ee60f330a50d9461ba03552a9f591d44)

So, yes. Today's story was consolidation at $22, as I called out in yesterday's post. Institutions walked us up to $22.50 - the lowest net positive gamma point in our proximal trading range - and then allowed traders to shoot the price down to test $22, On a 'fake-out' breach of $22, the price reversed hard back up above $22.50 to set an intraweek high of $22.65, before reversing back down sub VWAP and then getting pinned to the convergence of VWAP, the 50min SMA, and the 200min SMA into the close. Options volume was light with a slight bearish imbalance (and a decent number of MID trades), total shares traded trended down again to 4.3mil on the day, and IV ground lower to a low spot value of 85.7% at close.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

With such low options volume on the day it is unsurprising that we not see any changes to Max Pain, which remains constant for this week at $21.

[11\/8 OI Changes 11\/4-11\/5](https://preview.redd.it/85fykccwx2zd1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=0176bc6a2fe151a1196ef783575889d3d4348e8c)

New Call OI for this week was decent  for this week throughout our proximal trading range and up the chain toward $25. $23, $24, and $25 were our standout strikes for traders - unsurprising given their excellent liquidity and close BID/ASK spreads. Directional sentiment was more or less balanced, though skewed mildly toward the ASK on the $25c. New Put OI was modest and didn't insert itself below $21.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/4-11\/5](https://preview.redd.it/jgyayjso63zd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b91f238365451dbb4cc95b12a3ea3de39db2a84)

New OI for Nov OPEX was our only other options chain of significantly new OI. The same pattern emerges - new mixed sentiment Call OI at $23 and $25 (and $30) stands out, new Put OI is low. Total volume still comparatively low to last week's excitement. This all projects to do little to affect our current trading stability.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/qmb12dhav2zd1.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dbee5b9edb834a3638970c464f79146225cf4ae

And, sure enough, as we look at our gamma exposure landscape, that's exactly what we see - continued stability and oppositional volatility suppression at each of our whole dollar strikes from $20 up to $25. This more or less projects we stay trading in a measured fashion throughout the week using the lower Call GEX 'grooves' as intraday trading territory.

As long as our volume stays low - around 4mil-5mil shares - and we don't see any interventive shorting (risky given our current technical context as we have seen and will see below) we are likely going to remain stably consolidating in the $22-$23 with the bigger intraweek reversal trades coming off of $22 and $23, like we saw yesterday, Friday 11/1, and Thursday 10/31.

Now, one thing to pay attention to:

We've seen institutions take advantage of dense Call Gamma concentrations and GME's unusual IV dynamics to set-off mini $1-$2 Gamma squeezes on Fridays especially when intraweek IV values are at their lowest, the price is at the bottom of a prospective gamma ramp, and the Charm effect (delta decay over time) has hedging algorithms as light on weekly long shares hedges as they could be.

Why do they love this pump? Simple:

1. The day before the pump, you buy up calls during the afternoon trading session for cheap as retail or other external traders have their premiums drained by IV crush. When you pump the algorithms, these contracts have their values pump on IV pump alone, let alone on the $1-$2 price spike.
2. You can look at the GEX and see exactly where momentum will die out (a gamma neutral half-dollar strike) and where you have BIG time upside hedging resistance ($25). You can exit your calls on retail hype and euphoria while simultaneously selling OTM calls naked with an extremely short time to expiry. Charm will help you with that in the second half of the Friday anyway.

Maybe on the excuse of the election or JPOW, they walk the price down to the bottom of the ramp after enticing buyers to fill in some of the half-dollar strikes over the next couple days, before setting off another Friday Pump. It's took early to know whether this is coming into position at this point, but the potential is there. I'll be monitoring this as our trading unfolds this week.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/zeyehdllr2zd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=267a3e635e1783ed6f2c1fd4a5f57f1efed217bb)

So, yup, still consolidating and homing in on the 50-day SMA, which might signal one day this week we get a little bit of slip below $22 later on in the week - \*might\*. We definitely don't have to cruise on down RIGHT to the 50-day SMA for it serve as a general guide-rail for the price on the daily chart (TA is not mechanically causal; it is navigational with respect to human pathfinding psychology).

[10\/23-11\/4 4-hour Aggregation Actual w\/ Short Term Technical Inquiry Marks](https://preview.redd.it/0ihxignbt2zd1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7e207c3de9c6935dc897a860585b83ec6701ddf)

If you're into triangles and chart mark-ups, you might consider this plausible scenario on the 180-day chart. We have a 50-hr SMA test approaching today or Wednesday, given our return to RSI neutral (=50) after our big oversold signal last week around Cat Day. If we Zoom out a bit on the chart, we can see the degree to which RSI signals have been meaningfully predictive of reversals (Nikkeimageddon somewhat tenuously excepted):

[4hr Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/r15kcfo2b3zd1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f6ad3fad1f4e56c138766f3f181729ee8e9d828)

We'll have to watch here to see if the market ends up caring about this, as in the tend with TA, that's what matters - namely 'does the market care about this navigational marker on this stock, at this time, and in this context?' Let's see.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/uclc23alq2zd1.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2ac966a3aba4f699203c02243bfbe3bafad1f34

Returning to late August lows pre-Q2 earnings pump as we return to pre-Q2 earnings price levels. The lower we go at a supported price level, the more long whales will be enticed to set up positions to propel our momentum up to new levels capable of higher and higher consolidation. If we don't get any events this week, I'd expect to start to see low 80s.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

More consolidation around our $22-$23 range is probably what we're looking at. Maybe we see another probational dip a bit below $22 given the position of the 50-day SMA at $21.59 currently. Maybe institutions make the moves necessary over the next three days to build out and then set off another gamma ramp that retraces our steps from the 10/29 CATalyst. We will have to continue to the monitor the data to see.

Additionally, as far as Keith's symbolic memery, I would say it's possible the overture is currently being conducted, that the Battle of Borodino is already being fought. We might not hear it yet, so it might not yet be time for the cannons (and fireworks to go off), but that doesn't mean it isn't playing. I'm keeping this in mind for myself both with respect to measuring my expectations, my excitement, but also my vigilance as well.

Cheers and good luck out there!

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They‚Äôre usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I‚Äôve been doing them during coffee breaks‚Äîit‚Äôs a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ‚òïüí∏

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration ü§®**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I‚Äôd like. But hey, if you like gaming, it‚Äôs another way to earn while having fun. üéÆüïπÔ∏è

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! üéÅ**  
If you‚Äôre consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ‚òï Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks üìà**  
There‚Äôs a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I‚Äôll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! üëëüòÇ

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys üéâ**  
If you use my link, you‚Äôll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It‚Äôs a win-win for both of us. üéâ

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed üòÖ**  
There‚Äôs also a leaderboard, but I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit intense. I haven‚Äôt made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I‚Äôll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points üí≥**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It‚Äôs a fun way to treat yourself with what you‚Äôve earned!

If you‚Äôre looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I‚Äôve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up. Like they say, ‚Äúlittle drops make a mighty ocean‚Äù! Give it a try and let‚Äôs start earning!",1,1730816154.0,MakeMoneyOnlinefree,1,1.0,False
1gk7nkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1gk7nkg/little_things_to_help/,Little things to help,"What are some little things you do to help your tirz either work better, have less side effects etc?

  
For me its water intake, and protein.   
For water I have a 40 oz owala. in the morning I fill with water, 2 scoops of clear protein powder, and a packet of my caffeine powder (coffee makes me horribly sick). Thats 44g protein and I sip on that till about 1pm when I am down to about 1/4 and I refill it about halfway. I do this again later in the evening as well. So i get about 80 oz of water a day plus the protein. 

I also swear by trader joes high protein tofu. its super compressed so the whole block is smaller and has 70g of protein. 

I obviously eat and drink other things, but these have been really helpful so far <3 ",1,1730816104.0,tirzepatidecompound,5,0.67,False

Specifically looking for 
1. Places with comfy seats and plugs for laptop
2. Public wifi (but I can hotspot if needed) 
3. Universities that have areas open to the public. I'm also a remote grad student (the school is out of state) and miss studying in a uni library etc. 

Thanks!

1gk7mu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1gk7mu3/4th_retrieval_help_understanding/,4th retrieval help understanding,"Background: My wife (41) and I (36) just had our 4th retrieval. We retrieved 8 eggs with 7 being mature. My wife has never had such a good success rate before. She was at her best in terms of stress levels, and on top of all her supplements. 

The problem is with our fertilisation rate. So we did both zymot and icsi. We actually used 3 of my fresh sperm and 4 from a donor (we had a pgt positive with this guy in the past but had a miscarriage at 5 weeks). On this current cycle, we only were able to fertilize one egg with the donor sperm but the other eggs were poorly fertilised.

I have some male factor stuff going on with a dna frag of 20 percent. Not the best SA either but that‚Äôs due to health history beyond my control. Practiced good daily habits: 0 alcohol with the occasional coffee and daily cardio. I did daily ejaculation up to the day of retrieval as well. We did get 2 day 3‚Äôs with my sperm on our last cycle.

We are on day 3 now of our most current cycle, so we are praying our one and only fertilised egg has success. The lab is trying to assist mature the 8th egg. 

We‚Äôve never really had a lot of mature eggs in previous cycles. At most 2-3. Usually 1-2 fertilise . We are just so confused and disheartened as to why when we got the most number of mature eggs (7) of which the majority of them didn‚Äôt fertilize even with the donor sperm (who has a way better SA than mine). Also, the fact that we got a PGT-A with this guy before.

Any insights? Still waiting for the embryologist to touch base with our RA.
