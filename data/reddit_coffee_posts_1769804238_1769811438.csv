First off thank you for your suggestions on my previous post. I've decided to get my Manager some roasted Coffee beans as a small Gift as a token of my appreciation. She loves coffee and has a big fancy thing at home as she's a coffee addict.

My update was more around the businesses response as I have received a package in the mail from Angel Deliveries only to find that My Manager and 2x GMs have sent me a care package with a full meal

  
In today's society which is full of division and chaos, it's nice to see these gestures of kindness., hence why i thought to share.

I'm just a 2IC in a business with many cogs. I certainly did not expect a response from two General Managers.

1qrjpyd,https://i.redd.it/fjr9o9ww7kgg1.jpeg,Things to know before booking a wedding venue near Lake Wylie in 2026-2027 🤍,"One thing we hear a lot from couples touring venues near Lake Wylie is, *“We didn’t realize how many places were just nearby, not actually on the water.”* 

We’re The Grand, a restored timber-frame wedding venue opening just across the North Carolina line in York, South Carolina, about 40 minutes from Charlotte and minutes from Lake Wylie. 

As more couples look into the Lake Wylie area for 2026–2027 dates, we put together a planning guide based on the questions that usually come up once venue tours begin. It walks through what to pay attention to when comparing Lake Wylie wedding venues, including ceremony and reception flow, guest count, what’s typically included, vendor flexibility, indoor backup plans, and how different seasons affect availability and pricing. 

Our guide also covers wedding trends we’re seeing around Lake Wylie and the Charlotte area, plus ideas for turning the celebration into a full wedding weekend. We included suggestions for where guests like to stay, eat, grab coffee, explore breweries, and enjoy the area, along with a FAQ section that answers common early planning questions. 

Our venue sits on ten private acres and includes its own on-site lake, which means couples get a *true* lakeside ceremony without sharing the view with public traffic or other events. 

The Grand is being built right on the property right now, and we’re doing hard-hat tours so couples can walk the space, ask questions, and picture how the day will come together. We also share build updates and little behind-the-scenes moments on Instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/thegrand\_venue\_/](https://www.instagram.com/thegrand_venue_/)) if you want to follow along. 🤍

1qrjpb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1qrjpb2/military_couple_finally_retired_and_wanting_to/,Military couple finally retired and wanting to settle in WNC,"Hello all! Here for some advice on the Western North Carolina area. Husband was in the military for 20 years and just retired September of last year. We are excited to finally get to choose where we want to live vs being told where to go by the government. We have been talking about WNC for years as we feel it would be a perfect place for us. Neither of us has ever been there though and most likely when we move it will be without having visited first. That may sound crazy to some, but we are used to this way of life having been a military family - this was always the way. 

A little about us - we are both in our early mid 40s and empty nesters as of this year. I’m mostly a homebody who loves a good tv show or a good book. I love to clean and am into interior design so love decor. I love nature but more so in taking a long walk or sitting on my front porch and drinking coffee while I admire it sort of way. I love Fall, it is my most favorite time of year. I love the colors and the changing weather. My husband and I are both big foodies. He loves nature in the sense that he wants to be outdoors doing things - hiking, biking, kayaking, exploring. He also has a photography hobby and loves taking landscape and nature photos. He is into sports and has his teams he roots for, loves to grill and smoke meats. Loves to golf as well. 

We both want a smaller town vibe, 4 seasons (milder Winters and color changing Fall seasons), less crowded areas and less traffic, beautiful nature and outdoor activities around us. Mountains or beaches nearby a plus. Friendly people also is a priority. A home that is not on top of other homes - we don’t mind having neighbors but don’t want a track home where you can reach out your window and touch your neighbors house. Don’t need to live close to major amenities but would like to be able to drive to some within 30-60 minutes. 

We also want to live closer to his family in NY so that it is easier to drive there vs flying across the country. We have two pets: a cat and a dog, the dog can be aggressive with some people and other dogs so boarding him is not an option which has limited us on travel the last few years. We either have to take him with us to places within driving distance or only one of us can fly somewhere and the other has to stay behind. So that is why one, we want to live closer to his family and two, why visiting before moving isn’t really an option. 

My husband works in the aviation maintenance field but is open to other areas as well. We have enough income between his disability and retirement to live off of but he would like to work for extra income and to keep busy. I do not work and would like to keep it that way if possible. 

Places we have lived:

Southern California (where I’m from and where we met)

Upstate NY (where my husband is from and I’ve visited) 

Arizona (where we have been for 3 years) 

Wisconsin 

Nebraska 

Utah

Delaware

Missouri

Right now we live in Arizona and we absolutely hate it. It has been a rough few years for sure. Each passing month I feel a little piece of my soul dying and know that when I see my first Fall season I will probably cry tears of joy. My husband can’t wait to mow a lawn again lol. Between the heat 7-9 months of the year, the traffic/crowds and rude people, the scorpions as well as the desert landscape of brown and dead things with no trees or grass we are beyond ready to leave. If I never see another cactus again in my life it will be too soon. 

We plan to move at the end of April and we are going rent for a year while we decide what area is best for us to buy. 

We are looking in Hendersonville, Brevard, Waynesville, and Black Mountain areas so any advice for those areas would be so helpful! 

**TLDR**: newly retired military couple in mid 40s looking to settle in the WNC area looking for advice and general info. Currently in Arizona and hate it, moving in April. ",2,1769810913.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,1.0,False

1qrjkn8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qrjkn8,Foreign Ration Friday - Swedish Wet 8,"Felicitations on this frigid fucking Friday. After running errands I wanted something hot and filling that was instant noodles. So I reached into my old sack and found this Swedish Wet 8. These 24 hour rations are huge and a bit more thought out than a US FSR. It has snacks but the bulk of the nutrition is in the mains. I have pics of the front/back of the bag because they're the coolest outer packaging. It has a ruler and motivational quotes such as 7 and 100, oh and 108. You might find yourself on shit detail. The mains are crunchy granola with milk and coconut, chicken massaman with potatoes and chicken meatballs with spicy tomato. I also included the FRH and it's pretty cool with a zip top bag and 2 heaters for the 2 mains. You also get some energy bars, crackers, loads of coffee, vanilla protein shake and a few other items. I'll have pics of it as I eat it. The only thing it needed was a jam of some sort. I love a good jam. For late lunch I chose the chicken meatballs, sesame crackers, fruit cubes and black current isotonic drink. I haven't had that flavor yet, nor the strawberry one. Not the undrinkable strawberry mint one from France. Yeah I'm still salty about that one. 

I heated the main in boiling water for probably 12 minutes or so to insure that it was piping hot and boy howdy I achieved it. It's a hefty main so I put it in the bowl. It smelled amazing out of the pouch. The sauce wasn't a deep red but had a tomato sauce with some cream added despite not having any according to the ingredients list. Loads of pasta and more meatballs than I thought would be there. I was just missing a bit of parm or pecorino. Overall this was pretty damn good. It reminded me of chef boyardee but way better. I give it an 8.5/10 and would happily eat it anytime. 

I'm going to go a bit in depth on the main now. The pasta was plentiful but a bit overcooked. It wasn't mush but not al dente either. I'm still convinced that many mains are soft for ease of eating and speed of eating. The softer it is, the less you need to chew. That's just my opinion. The meatballs were well seasoned and plentiful. But they were on the tough side. Still easy to eat but not very moist. It's a minor thing with the pasta and meatballs but it knocked it down a bit. Now the sauce was rich and tomato-y. It tasted like it had cheese and a bit of cream in it but it's not listed. What is listed is yeast extract which might account for it. What the sauce definitely wasn't was spicy. It has jalapeños listed but no spice. You don't want to give the troops gastrointestinal issues during maneuvers but if you're going to say spicy then have a kick. Maybe this is spicy to the Swedes. This minor issues kept this from being a phenomenal main. Hopefully the massaman doesn't suffer from that. 

The sesame crackers reminded me of wheat thins but not as good. By themselves they were fine but they could have benefited from something to put on them like jam, nut spread or a pâté. I wish they would perfect a retort pouch pâté. I know they make tubes and some pouches but a squeezable pâté...woooooo boy. France you have a chance to redeem yourself from the atrocious fruit mint isotonic drinks. Would I eat these again...sure. Would I enjoy it... possibly. 6/10 for me. 

The black current isotonic drink was a first for me. It called for 250mL of water but I did like 300mL to cut back on the sweetness and it was perfect. We don't get much currant flavored items here in the US and it was banned for many decades because it carries a fungus that's harmful to white pine. This is why Skittles are grape here and not black currant. It's no longer banned federally but is regulated by the States. It dissolved fine but was a bit cloudy and it tasted fine. It had a pleasant black currant flavor that's reminiscent of Vimto (which contains black currant) with a violet undertone. Yes I mean the flower and yes they're edible here in North America. 9/10 for me. You could make homemade Vimto if you had some sparkling grape juice. 

For dessert I grabbed the fruit cubes. They look like jujubes candy but taste way better. It's a mixed fruit that was mostly blueberry and strawberry. It also had papaya, lychee and apple. It didn't list it but there was one that tasted like pineapple and had the ripe golden color. They had a soft texture with strong fruit flavors. I could eat these on the regular with no complaints. 10/10 for me. If you want a more fruit based candy instead of an artificially flavored one this is it. 

So far this has been an excellent ration. If you see these grab them. You get lots of delicious, filling vittles. Thanks for stopping by and stay, safe, stay warm and be nice to each other. ",1,1769810617.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

I found out when I came home early from work and saw her standing in my bedroom holding the empty jewelry box my mom left me. The one with the note inside the lid that said ""wear these and think of me."" She actually smiled when she saw me and said she'd ""tidied up"" my dresser.

I asked where the jewelry was. She waved her hand toward the kitchen and said she put it with the trash for pickup. My heart stopped. I ran to the garage and the bins were already on the curb. I tore through three bags of garbage in my work clothes, crying and covered in coffee grounds and rotting food, while she stood in the doorway telling me I was being dramatic.

I found six pieces. My mom's engagement ring was gone. Her grandmother's locket was gone. The pearl earrings she wore to my wedding were gone.

My husband wasn't even home. His mother has a key because she watches our dog sometimes. She let herself in, went through my personal belongings, and decided my jewelry box was ugly. That's what she told me. ""That ratty old box clashed with the nice bedroom set we bought you.""

We didn't ask for the bedroom set. She insisted on buying it and now apparently she thinks that gives her decorator rights to my entire house.

I lost it. I screamed at her that those were the only things I had left of my mom. She died four years ago and I don't have siblings. No aunts or uncles. That jewelry was it. She said I should be grateful she left the box so I ""still have the sentimental part"" and that I was being ungrateful and materialistic.

I told her to get out. She refused. She said she wasn't leaving until my husband came home because I was being hysterical and someone needed to talk sense into me. I called my husband seventeen times. He was in a meeting. I called the non-emergency police line and asked how to remove someone from my home who wouldn't leave.

She started crying and yelling that I was insane. That she was trying to help. That she drove forty minutes to do me a favor by organizing while I was at work.

The officer who showed up was a woman about my age. She saw my hands still covered in garbage and asked what happened. My mother-in-law tried to explain that this was a family misunderstanding but I interrupted and said ""she threw away my dead mother's jewelry without asking and now she won't leave my house.""

The officer asked my mother-in-law to step outside. I don't know what was said but she left. Before she got in her car she shouted that I'd regret this and that I was keeping her son from his family.

My husband came home an hour later. He saw the garbage bags torn open in the garage and me sitting on the floor still crying. I told him everything. He tried to say his mom didn't mean it. That she probably didn't realize how important the jewelry was.

I asked him how someone doesn't realize that jewelry in a special box on someone's dresser might be important. He said she's just trying to be helpful and has boundary issues but her heart is in the right place.

I gave him a choice. He could explain to his mother that she's not welcome in our home anymore and we're changing the locks, or he could go live with her.

He said I was being extreme. I reminded him that his mother threw away his dead mother-in-law's jewelry and called the police on me in my own home when I asked her to leave. He said she didn't call the police, I did. Like that was the problem.

We fought for two days. He kept saying I'd regret ruining his relationship with his mom over ""stuff."" I told him if he called my mother's jewelry ""stuff"" one more time he could pack a bag.

He finally agreed to talk to her. She called me a manipulative witch who turned her son against her. She said she was going to sue me for emotional distress. My husband told her that was insane and hung up.

But he still thinks I should apologize for calling the police. He said it humiliated her and now his whole family knows and they're taking her side. His sister sent me a text calling me a spoiled brat. His dad said I clearly never learned respect.

I changed the locks anyway. My husband has a key. His mother does not. He's barely speaking to me. His family is blowing up my phone saying I'm tearing the family apart.

I spent four hundred dollars on therapy last week talking about my mom. The earrings are still gone. The ring is still gone. The locket is still gone.

AITA?

I’d rather build a little more connection first and then plan something when it feels natural.” I’m okay with that right anyways I do exactly just that for the next 3 days but she keeps saying things like this “It’s so much to planning honestly I can’t talk about it all in a message with limited characters haha so I can share more about that in person one day!!” “I can definitely see that in you! You’re very mature for your age which is why I asked you the other day if you were actually 24 😭pero I would identify the same. I’m probably the most open person at this point in my life, ugh that’s a conversation that is so broad and we could dive deeper in person for sure because it’s a lottttt which has brought me to who I am today. I’m not an extremist to say this is what I believe and no one can move me from here. No. I love hearing other peoples perspectives based on their own experiences and it always allows me to question so many things. I’m a very curious and intense person in the sense that everything I find interest in becomes almost a passion to learn more from or become better in.” So I haven’t brought it up at all but she started like 2 days later I believe that she keeps mentioning that this conversation would definitely be a in person or in person that. I guess what I’m trying to say what’s going on? It’s day 4 since she said that soft yes. Does she want me to ask her out on a low stake date for example a walk or a coffee date? Or is she trying to mentally get ready? Or does she literally mean this topic is better in person? Im trying to respect her wishes, but it’s like bothering me that she keeps mentioning it like does she want me to ask her out now? What do you all think? I believe she has mentioned in person like 4-7 times ballpark.",1,1769810220.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Remember the first time your child picked up a crayon and *really* focused? The way they furrowed their little brows, completely lost in a swirl of color? It’s a rare kind of magic — that calm, screen-free silence where creativity takes over.  

In a world overflowing with notifications and noise, coloring still feels like one of the purest forms of mindfulness — especially for kids. They don’t just fill pages; they express emotions, develop focus, and build confidence in tiny, colorful strokes.  

That’s exactly why I put together a **Kids Coloring Ebook** filled with joyful scenes, easy outlines, and playful details. It’s made for little hands — and for parents who crave a few quiet minutes to sip coffee while their kids dive into creativity.  

Here’s what I’ve learned (and lived) along the way:  
• Coloring helps kids *self-regulate* emotions better than most calming techniques.  
• Simple shapes and happy themes boost attention span (naturally).  
• Creative time > screen time — every single day.  

💡Real parents have told me this little routine has transformed bedtime calm, homeschool breaks, and after-school unwinding. And that’s why I want every family here to experience it too.

I recently covered the International Tournament hosted by Samuel Rachmann in my posts on 1915 & 1916, but I wanted to do up a singular post that detailed the whole tournament. 

 
**Main Characters**

 
Samuel Rachmann – Theater promoter from Europe, with some wild plans for his first attempts at promoting a wrestling event.

 
The “Masked Marvel” – Lower card wrestler who is about to be thrust into the biggest opportunity of his career.

 
Jack Curley – New York based promoter with aspirations to become the biggest wrestling promoter in the country.

 
Alex Aberg – Standout mat grappler who wrestles exclusively under Greco-Roman rules, and maintains a dubious claim of being the Greco-Roman world champion.
 

Ed “Strangler” Lewis – Top wrestler in the country, coming off a loss to world champion Joe Stecher.

 
Wladek Zbyszko – Younger brother of former world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko, building up his name value on the West coast.

 
Joe Stecher – World heavyweight champion who is building mass appeal across the country.

 
As always, we do this in chronological order, and we start in twilight of 1915, with the pro wrestling scene in a tumultuous time…

 
**1915**

 
By the Winter of 1915, pro wrestling's world heavyweight champion was the undefeated **Joe Stecher**, who was beginning to gain national appeal as a pro wrestler. As **Stecher reigned with the world title**, primarily defending in the mid-west, the pro wrestling scene in New York was in dire need of a shakeup.

 
Boxing exploded in popularity, with the implementation of the Frawley Law and the undefeated championship reign of Jack Johnson, which lasted over two thousand days, leaving pro wrestling with very little popularity or growth. It wasn’t until the first World War started that things would change for the pro wrestling scene. By late 1915, a score of top-flight foreign wrestlers who had fled to America during the early days of the War, were ready to make a splash in the American market. They just needed a promoter who could see the potential. 

 
**Samuel Rachmann’s Tournament**

 
That promoter, would be former actor-turned-theatre promoter, **Samuel Rachmann***. Samuel Rachmann is a name most wrestling fans will have never heard of, but almost every wrestling fan has felt the influence he left on the business. **In late-1915, Rachmann would host a wrestling tournament in New York, featuring an all-star cast of world wide talent**, and he planned for it to be grander and more ambitious than any tournament the city had ever seen before.

 
Rachmann, having successfully promoted theatre’s and concerts in Europe, wanted to bring that grand flavor to the States for this event, and planned twelve consecutive weeks of nightly wrestling shows at the 3000+ seat theatre, the Manhattan Opera House. In early November 1915, Rachmann was quoted in the New York Times, hyping up the event, “Swedes, Finns, Turks, Greeks, Poles, Huns, Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, French, Germans, Swiss, Danes, English and Americans will compete!” Rachmann even promised each performer a weekly salary, something unheard of at the time. Although the starting salary was only $100 per week, with the top guys earning a percentage of the gate.

 
If you read my reports of the early 1900s, you may be remembering how Frank Gotch got over as the American hero besting the foreign menace George Hackenschmidt, and now you may be wondering why Rachmann would go all in on an international tournament. It’s worth considering that between 1900 and 1914, more than thirteen million people arrived to the country, with a large portion finding home in New York, and this influx of people continued for over a decade and only doubled and tripled at the start of the first World War. America, and New York in general, was filled with folks from all over Europe at this point. 

 
Its also worth noting that Rachmann teamed with a local promoter in New York, the legendary **Jack Curley**. Curley made a name for himself promoting events in Illinois and Missouri, but recently came to New York with hopes of establishing himself as the top promoter in the territory. Details on their partnership here aren’t well known, but we do know that Curley had a hand in promoting nearly every event alongside Rachmann.

 
**The Rules**

 
Its important to note that pro wrestling matches had a couple different options, in terms of the rules of engagement for any particular match. The most popular rules were Collar & Elbow, Greco-Roman, and Catch-As-Catch-Can style.

 
**Collar-and-elbow** was originally introduced by Irish immigrants in Vermont, usually demonstrated for fun in taverns and town halls. The contest was simple: opponents would begin standing facing one another, with one hand on their opponents collar bone, and the other hand on their elbow. A fall was called when one contestant was tripped, thrown or in anyway knocked off their feet.

 
The popularity of collar-and-elbow would be followed up by a new form of wrestling, introduced originally in Europe, called **Greco-Roman** wrestling. Though it was never practiced in Greece or Rome, the name lent some panache and a sense of history, even if the concept wasn’t that old. 
 

Greco-Roman wrestling saw two competitors face off similar to collar-and-elbow, though the skirmish would continue even after the men brought each other down to the ground. A fall was called when one man held the other with some combination of a wrestlers body parts – both shoulders and a hip, or both hips and a shoulder – touching the mat at the same time. 

 
It could be an exhausting endeavor with some bouts lasting several hours long. And for audiences the action and maneuvering for position would be obscured when both men began rolling on the ground or mat. This is where we got our first glimpse into what pro wrestling would become. The more experienced and clever participants would learn to read the audience and control the pacing of the bout to convey suspense and uncertainty. It wouldn’t be unrealistic to see several near falls and throws following a long stretch of maneuvering on the ground. Sometimes if two guys were following a bout that lasted an hour, they would ensure theirs ends in minutes. 

 
Over the last decade the United States was starting to see a new style of wrestling overtake the Greco-Roman flavor. A fresh style of wrestling that was admittedly more violent than the standard Greco-Roman wrestling that had become popular. This new style was known as **catch-as-catch-can**.

 
Catch wrestling, as catch-as-catch-can came to be known, originated back in Lancashire, England, and was seemingly brought to the States by the men who travelled overseas to find fame and fortune in America. Catch was more free and faster than any other form of wrestling, allowing for holds to be applied anywhere on the body. Catch saw submission finishes much more frequently than previous forms of wrestling and encouraged technique and skill over brute force, which was the primary factor in previous forms of wrestling. Billy Robinson’s book spoke on the history more specifically and I need to re-read that one. American audiences, drawn by the quick and violent action, quickly claimed catch as their own, and it almost immediately made Greco-Roman look more ponderous and antiquated than it already was. 
 

For Samuel Rachmann’s International Tournament, **he would employ the older Greco-Roman style of matches, and it seems the tournament would operate under a round robin point system**, as opposed to a single-elimination system. Honestly though the specifics seems to be lost to time, with most historians thinking it was a point system because the tournament was ran daily for three months straight, reusing everyone involved multiple times over.

 
**The Prize**

 
Perhaps a reason Samuel Rachmann choose to utilize the Greco-Roman style of wrestling, was because of the reward he was able to arrange for the winner of his tournament. On top of a cash payout, the tournament winner would also receive a championship match against **Alex Aberg**, who held the dubious claim or being the Greco-Roman world champion. 
 

Alex Aberg was a thirty-five-year-old from Kolga, Estonia who had been wrestling throughout the world for the past fifteen years, and by all accounts, he was described by his peers as one of the very best mat grapplers in the world. Standing at six feet tall and over two hundred and thirty pounds, Aberg was a well-respected and legitimate shooter. **Aberg has held the claim of Greco-Roman world champion for several years, stating that he won the belt back in 1903**, and had been defending it against all comers in the New York area for years. Its not a really a claim worth tracing though, because several different wrestlers all over the world claimed to be the Greco-Roman world champion through the previous decade.
 

**Vince McMahon Junior’s Flavor of Ice Cream**
 

Rachmann seemed poised to win over the theatre going crowd in New York with **Ed “Strangler” Lewis**, who preformed in the tournament, recalling that “it seemed to be a show conducted by an artist, with artists, for artists.” Top wrestling contender **Wladek Zbyszko** would also join Lewis in the tournament, with a serious style that seemed to contrast what Rachmann was planning. Rachmann seemed to be creating a card that would better resemble something Vince McMahon Jr would later be known for. Rachmann judged his performers based on their ability to excite a crowd and arranged each evenings card in a way that gave it variety, mixing the more serious matches on the same show that also featured **matches designed 100% around comedy**. Some **wrestlers would chase each other around the ring** and fight into the wings of the opera house, others would **stamp their feet out of frustration** when they lost a bout, and it seemed like more so than what came before, this show resembled what we see today. The goal of each wrestler in the tournament seemed to be sports entertainment-infused. Here are several examples of wrestlers in the tournament.
 

**The Freaks**

 
 - Sulo Hevonpaa was a twenty-four-year-old wrestler who would drape his elegant robe over a chair at ringside, before his opponents would wipe their boots off on it. 
 


 - La Colosse was a near-four hundred pound French wrestler who **made broad pleas to the referee in his over exaggerated accent, as the audience laughed at his inability to **communicate. 
 


 - “Farmer” George Bailey was a twenty-three-year-old wrestler from Vermont, and had a gimmick that would make Jim Cornette’s head explode. **Bailey claimed he could hypnotize his opponents and did just that on one match, convincing his opponent to run around the stage like a maniac**. 



 - Dimitrios Tofalos was a Greece-born twenty-one-year-old former Olympic weightlifter, who would **come to the ring dressed in a tuxedo, where he would sing opera before changing into his wrestling gear.**
 

Years later, promoter Jack Pfefer would base his later career around booking oddities and side-show wrestlers who he genuinely referred to as **“Freaks.”** I like to think that Pfefer based a lot of that philosophy on the success of this tournament, especially within New York.
 

This wasn’t just a tournament filled with comedy wrestlers though, as Samuel Rachmann made sure to book all the top wrestlers in the country as well. The list of names within the tournament who were considered first-class wrestlers across the counter, included…
 

**The Draws**
 

 - Ed “Strangler” Lewis was a twenty-four-year-old standout wrestler from Wisconsin, who has been making waves across the country since he joined forces with promoter/ manager Billy Sandow. Lewis stands 5’10” but weighed over 260 pounds of muscle and mass. He was known for his devastating headlock finisher, which is why he was called, the “Strangler.”



 - Charles Cutler was a thirty-one-year-old wrestler from Michigan, who recently had a brief as the world heavyweight champion. He previous only wrestled as Charlie “Kid” Cutler until revamping his image in the early 1910s, leading to his brief reign as world champion before he dropped it to Joe Stecher.



 - Wladek Zbyszko was a twenty-four-year-old Polish strongman-turned-wrestler who was brought to America by his older brother, former world heavyweight champion Stanislaus Zbyszko. Stanislaus was currently enlisted in the First World War, where he would he captured by Russia and spend half-a-decade as a prisoner of war. Wladek was ten years younger and opted to stay in America, to build up his wrestling career.
 


 - Alex Aberg was a thirty-four-year-old Russian-born wrestler who specialized in the old-school Greco-Roman style of pro wrestling, which this tournament would be fought under. Aberg made the disputed claim of being the Greco-Roman world champion for the previous decade and was usually recorded defending such a title in matches. It’s a claim that many wrestlers made and is impossible to verify, unfortunately.
 


 - Dr Benjamin Roller was a forty-year-old wrestler from Illinois, who spent years as a legitimate practicing surgeon before turning to pro wrestling after the traumatic death of a young patient. At the time of the tournament, Roller was recognized as the reigning American heavyweight champion.
 
 
**The Tournament**

 
Samuel Rachmann’s tournament **officially kicked off on November 8th, 1915**, showcasing a six match card that saw Charles Cutler defeat Fritz Mohl, in nine minutes. The event also saw Dr Ben Roller give a speech putting over the tournament. Ill point out here that all tournament events took place at the Manhattan Opera House.

 
Dr Ben Roller also registered a win over Fritz Mohl in the next nights tournament show. Roller won the main event in under five minutes on a card that featured six other matches, including Cutler gaining another win over Charles Olsen.
 

The tournament held nightly events for three months straight, with names like Wladek Zbyszko joining the tournament on the November 11th show, in a match that saw him defeat The Great Daro in just forty-nine seconds. The seven match card also saw Alex Aberg defeat Fritz Wagner in just four minutes. These cards all featured quick match times compared to what was usually happening in pro wrestling at the time. 

 
**Sports Entertainment**
 

Just like the wrestlers, the matchers were also prone to hijinks and silliness. **One show ended when the curtains above the ring fell mid-match and onto two wrestlers who refused to break their holds.** As the theatre staff extinguished the lights and the patrons filed out of the building, they could still hear the two wrestlers groaning in the dark, seemingly still holding onto one another. The Brooklyn Times Union’s John Fleeson would wrote about these shows, saying “It would be impossible to describe what occurs every night. Still, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that there is more genuine comedy and laughter in this tournament than in many play now running.”

 
Personal note: I’ve never been a big fan of comedy in wrestling and usually hate it to be honest, but I didn’t realize silly shit like this was happening as far back as 1915. Next time I argue against the use of comedy (for my mind isn’t changed) I will at least not cite old school wrestling as being above this silliness. 

 
Unfortunately though, and has been my argument against comedy in wrestling, Rachmann’s tournament struggled to fill seats as the weeks went on. Because comedy isn’t sustainable as a long-term solution for filling seats, by the second month, in December, Rachman was reportedly facing thousands of dollars in debt. Ever the showman, Rachmann would gamble even further before admitting defeat, by getting *serious*.

 
**The Masked Marvel**
 

Rachmann kept the tournament going and debuted a new name, and unknown man wearing a black hood with holes cut out for his eyes. This new masked man, was called the **Masked Marvel** by reporters and became an immediate hit as an unbeatable force in the tournament. **The Masked Marvel would make short work of the four hundred pound La Colosse**, the roar of the crowd, and another time when his opponent tried to flee the venue, the Masked Marvel dragged him back to the ring so he could pin him.

 
The Masked Marvel never stayed long after his win, always quickly heading to the back, which only added to his mystique and aura. **The boys in the back didn’t even know who he was**, as the Masked Marvel would always leave immediately after his matches. When the Marvel did mingle with the crowd, he was a pro who always knew what to say and put himself over. One time when asked what his name was, he told the fans, “Call me Desdichado,” referencing the legend of Ivanhoe. He would assure the fans that he has a very good reason for concealing his identity and promised it would all be revealed eventually, though that was all a bluff.

 
The Masked Marvel’s popularity and impact on the tournament cannot be understated, as seats filled up significantly on nights he wrestled, with Rachmann noticing that **on the nights Marvel competed, nearly half the seats would be filled with women**. Seeing that many women in the stands was unheard for pro wrestling so of course Rachmann started to capitalize on the new found interest. Rachmann adopted a new slogan for the tournament: “Don’t cheat your wife, bring her along!”

 
**Success**

 
Zoe Beckley was a writer for the Washington Post when she was assigned the task of covering the tournament, with her writing “Every third person in the audience was a woman. I went to stay five minutes and remained there for three hours and a quarter, being then pried, reluctantly, from my seat. **Don’t ask me what it was all about. The funny part is that you don’t have to understand it to enjoy it.”** I absolutely love this quote, as it sums up how a non-fan can become immediately indoctrinated by the spectacle of pro wrestling.

 
Worth noting is that The Masked Marvel was not the first masked wrestler in recorded pro wrestling history. The first one was actually all the way back in 1867, in Paris, France, where he got over for a short period besting many of the most well known wrestlers at the time. Many assume that Rachmann must have gotten the idea for the Masked Marvel from that first masked star, nearly fifty years prior. In fact, in the contract Marvel signed for the tournament, it gave Rachmann sole credit for the idea of the Masked Marvel.

 
Also worth noting in the same vein, would be Ben Atwood, who newspapers claim was the original visionary behind the Masked Marvel. Though Ben would later clarify and say the idea was given to him by Mark Leuscher. Leuscher was a theatre producer who had a hit of his own, years prior with a masked dancer in the Zeigfield Follies, whom he called “La Domino Rouge.” **Credit for choosing the wrestler to be under the mask, apparently goes to promoter Jack Curley**, who had a relationship with Rachmann that was “vague at best” with Curley supposedly helping fund some of the tournament.

 
The man under the mask was Mort Henderson, a no-name wrestler from Altoona, Pennsylvania, who despite being pegged for such a significant role, **was still being paid the bare minimum $100 per week**.

 
Ed “Strangler” Lewis was presented very strongly through the exhausting three month long tournament. When the “Strangler” wasn’t winning, he was wrestling to draws in several long matches. Lewis registered three draws with Wladek Zbyszko over the course of the tournament and another draw with Alex Aberg, which was memorable because it **lasted until real-life police officers stopped the match after the time of the match went past one in the morning**. Adding to this would be another draw Lewis registered in a bout with Charles Cutler on December 9th, 1915.
 

**Betrayal**
 

The Masked Marvel’s popularity was exploding with each passing show, and unfortunately for Rachmann, this would be noticed by another opportunistic promoter in New York, our very own Jack Curley. It seems **Curley got in Mort Henderson’s ear and convinced him to quit the tournament** and come work exclusively for Curley. Once it became clear to Samuel Rachmann that he was about to lose his star attraction, he did what most every other promoter/ booker would do in similar situations throughout wrestling history. 
 

Promoter/ booker Samuel Rachmann had **Ed “Strangler” Lewis squash the Masked Marvel** in their tournament match on December 20th, 1915. According to newspapers from that week, the two men met at the Manhattan Opera House in a match that lasted just a couple of minutes, with Lewis going over in dominant fashion. 
 

Before we close out the year its worth pointing out that without the Masked Marvel, Ed “Strangler” Lewis became the biggest star in the tournament. **The only loss Lewis sustained through the whole tournament, would be against Alex Aberg** on December 29th, and it was a match fought under old-school Greco-Roman rules.

 
**1916**
 

Samuel Rachmann’s international tournament had been holding daily events at the Manhattan Opera House for the past two months, and without question, the breakout star of the tournament was Mort “The Masked Marvel” Henderson, who became a must-see attraction for Rachmann. As a reminder, the tournament operated on a point system, and not a single elimination style matchups. Also, the tournament was contested under the more constricting Greco-Roman rules, as opposed to the catch-as-catch-can style of rules which had become very popular in America in the past decade.

 
**The Unmasked Marvel**

 
The January 3rd, 1916 edition of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle printed a picture of Mort Henderson, with the caption that read, **“The Masked Marvel without his hood.”** While its possible that Jack Curley had something to do with this, it would also hamper his plans to feature the Masked Marvel, so I doubt that. Considering how popular the tournament was in New York, I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that photographers were trying to snap a picture of him for several weeks at this point. My bet is that some lucky photographer got a good payoff that day.
 

Despite the set-backs, Samuel Rachmann’s tournament continued with a tournament match between Ed “Strangler” Lewis and Wladek Zbyszko from January 7th, 1916. The match would be called a draw as the two men wrestled past curfew, according to newspapers. A few days later, on January 10th, Wladek Zbyszko met the Masked Marvel in a tournament match which also went to a draw, after two-and-a-half-hours of grappling. 
 

**Curley’s Efforts**
 

Its worth noting that Curley was still promoting a big New York show set for the end of the month, and in mid-January **he announced a world heavyweight championship match** for the big show, set to headline Madison Square Garden on January 27th, 1916. Although I cant be clear about this, it sounds like Curley was promoting the event as Joe Stecher defending his title against the winner of an upcoming tournament match between “Strangler” Lewis and Wladek Zbyszko.
 

Another tournament match would see Ed “Strangler” Lewis defeat Dr Benjamin Roller in New York on January 15th, 1916, and while Roller was the American heavyweight champion, this appears to have been a non-title bout.

 
After weeks of negotiations, **the breakout star of the tournament, Mort “The Maske Marvel” Henderson, abruptly quit the tournament** altogether and informed Rachmann that Jack Curley had offered him more than ten times his weekly salary for one big match at Madison Square Garden at the end of the month. For anyone impressed by this, its important to remember that Henderson was an unknown wrestler who was being paid a paltry $100 per week. Despite being under contract, Henderson stopped showing up for his tournament matches and eventually Rachmann hit Henderson with an injunction, just two days before he was scheduled for Jack Curley’s big Garden show.

 
**Tournament Finals**
 

Samuel Rachmann’s tournament would wrap up by the end of January, after nearly twelve weeks of nightly matches. Worth noting, would be that **Ed “Strangler” Lewis dropped out of the tournament** after exchanging a win and loss in back-to-back matches with Wladek Zbyszko. **The tournament finals would be fought on January 24th, 1916, between Wladek Zbyszko and Alex Aberg,** who claimed to be the Greco-Roman champion at the time.  
 
Alex Aberg and Wladek Zbyszko met in the Samuel Rachmann tournament finals on January 24th, 1916, with **Aberg being declared the winner** after a controversial finish. About twenty-five minutes into the match, Aberg tossed Zbyszko out of the ring where he reportedly crashed hard into the back of the stage. After calling a doctor, Zbyszko determined that he was hurt and unable to continue the match, as fans screamed at him, calling Zbyszko a “quitter” and a “fake.” Although the doctor said Zbyszko was fit to continue, Zbyszko refused, insisting that he was hurt. After nearly an hour of deliberations, the referee of the bout, George Bothner announced Alex Aberg as the winner.
 

**Curley’s Madison Square Garden Show**
 

Since I spent so long talking about it, I figured I should detail Jack Curley’s Madison Square Garden event. Remember how Curley announced that world champion Joe Stecher would defend his belt against the winner of a matchup between Wladek Zbyszko and Ed “Strangler” Lewis? Well since then, Zbyszko and Lewis wrestled twice and both registered a win over the other, and while the general public would be more interested in a potential Lewis-Stecher rematch, Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow already left town to tour with their made-up world title claim. Wladek would make sense, but he just lost a high-profile match to Alex Aberg, so Curley didn’t want to match up Stecher with someone who the public just witnessed lose a big bout, leaving Curley with little options.
 

I’m sure most of you are already wondering why Alex Aberg wouldn’t be selected for this world title opportunity, and that will be because Alex Aberg specifically wrestles his matches under Greco-Roman rules, whereas most modern (for 1916) matches at the time were fought under the less constricting Catch-As-Catch-Can style of rules. Catch wrestling was freer and faster compared to Greco-Roman, and Aberg had little interest in expanding his skill-set, so Curley needed to find an alternative. That left only one real option for Curley to match up **Joe Stecher, against the breakout star of Rachmann’s tournament, the Masked Marvel**, Mort Henderson. Remember, Rachmann had already tried to oppose this by **filing an injunction that specifically named the Masked Marvel and “Strangler” Lewis as being unable to leave the tournament in favor of Curley’s promoted events** in New York. Curley didn’t take this lightly and fought the injections, leading to a suit between the two promoters.
 

**Curley-Rachmann**

 
Just like Jack Curley and Ole Marsh exposed the business in Seattle, five years prior, the resulting suit, which was reported on by all major New York papers, also exposed the business. The suit named Henderson as the Marvel and revealed that his contract with Rachmann called for Henderson to win and lose matches as directed. Luckily for Curley, who faced the prospect of replacing his main attraction on two days notice, **both he and Rachmann were able to come to terms and the injunction was dropped.** No details are given beyond the fact that Curley and Rachmann spent hours deliberating with their lawyers until some agreement was made between the two promoters that allowed Curley to use Henderson in his show, even advertising him as the Masked Marvel.

 
On January 27th, 1916, Curley’s Madison Square Garden show went as planned, with thousands in attendance for the main event that pitted the Masked Marvel Mort Henderson against the current world champion from Nebraska, Joe Stecher. **Stetcher would dominate the best two of three falls contest, pinning Henderson in back-to-back falls in less than fifteen minutes.** With this show a success, **Jack Curley had firmly established his own foothold in Manhattan**, making the city his new base of operations going forward.

 
**The Prize**

 
With Samuel Rachman’s tournament wrapped up, the **tournament winner Alex Aberg officially accepted a $5,000 check on January 29th, 1916.** Considering he won the tournament, the proze of facing him for the title basically went out the window. The end of the tournament would signal the end of any interest in Greco-Roman style wrestling matches, and the end of Samuel Rachmann’s promotional career in pro wrestling. Rachmann, seemingly having enough of pro wrestling, never attempted to get back into the wrestling business. Though he only spent long enough in the business to have a cup of coffee, his influence on the product going forward cannot be overstated. Judging by what we have covered, Rachmann would have fit right in with a lot modern performers.
 

**And that’s about all there is to write on Rachmann’s Tournament**, with Alex Aberg being declared the winner, and Jack Curley firmly establishing himself as a top promoter in New York.
 

Ill be back next week with my next entry in the History of Pro Wrestling, detailing the year 1917, and the remainder of Joe Stecher’s world title reign. Ill also have Nattie Neidhart’s book, and Ill probably post my reports in the Hart Family as well, since I haven’t done that yet on this subreddit.

I only turned 18 a bit over a month ago now and after that everything just seemed to go downhill. People who shouldn’t have died, died. People I loved with my heart body and soul just stopped loving me back. I put so much energy into everything I do and after the OD I just feel weak, frail and useless.

I’ve always wanted to live in ignorance to the things I know will hurt me, some of the highlights of my life come from me not knowing the truth of a situation and although stupid, it’s brought me most of the happiness I know.

Killing myself over the past seems pathetic but it’s the only way I feel I’ll ever bring myself and the people around me peace. I know it would be selfish to the people that care but quite literally nothing has ever helped stop the hurt I feel and have always felt. 

I don’t blame the people in my life I just blame the experiences around them. I still love people I should hate. I don’t think I’ll ever stop.

But my great-great grandfather was a guard at the Nuremberg trials, so I started to reach out to him for guidance, considering the current state of the world

I use dice to communicate with him, because he continuously refuses to use Tarot cards. There was a brief period where I tried to show him how, but after maybe an hour of that, he started to repeatedly hit 'no' 'no' 'no' 'no,' on the dice, and I got the sense he was done with that.

Today though, I asked my grandma, his daughter, if my Grandad had a favorite drink that she knew of, because I wanted to start making it whenever I reached out to him again, and she said he used to drink black coffee all day everyday. 

I usually update him on events, and he'll usually hit me with messages like, ""Be careful,"" ""Stay safe,"" and ""Keep doing what you're doing,"" because I record and document everything. 

I do genuinely get the feeling that he is guiding me, as I do everything I can at the moment.

My grandma, today, told me, ""You would have loved him. He was a great guy, and he loved all his grandkids a lot,"" and I know she's right because I feel it everytime I call to him. He passed when I was 4 years old, but I feel like I know him. ",4,1769809373.0,pagan,0,1.0,False

Yes if you go to my account you'll see the context behind my stories and no this didn't happen to me. It happened to a friend of mine who told me to share it. There are other things she wanted me to tell you but hats for the end. Also, if I forget punctuation pls don't mind idc for stuff like that (sorry if I sound rude). Also, pls don't mind if I misspell stuff anyways Ty and continue!  (Will be speaking in 1st person and I will swear)

Ok so lemme cut to the chase. My whole life, my parents never treated me like a human. There was no golden child, no cousin grabbing their attention and no step siblings. Just me and my shitty excuse for parents. So ever since I was like 13, it became apparent to me that I NEEDED TO GET THE FUCK OUT.	 so I busted my ass before upgrading jobs when I turned 16. Obviously, I never told my parents. I don't know if it was their alcoholic selves, or just them not caring, but they never checked on me. The beating actually weren't as bad when I got a job so thank fuck. Anyways, the second I was 18 I BOOKED IT. Crashed on my friends sofa, continued to bust my ass and I ghosted my parents.

Ok next paragraph coz the story is shifting, I was like 3 hours away from them and tbh I was only like 18 like hours after crashing at my friends. Obviously, I got a new phone but still stalked their insta, like a creep. They filed me missing 3 WEEKS yes you heard that right, THREE WEEKS after I left. And Their insta wasn't large so you probs haven't seen it, but I'd say most the neighbours ect were worried. Leaving bs comments like 'stay strong!' and those exaggerated emojis on their fake posts. It got old so I blocked them and moved on. I pulled my way through community college and landed a full time job. There's no need for y'all to know coz the only reason we 'reunited' was coz of my side gig. I worked (still work) with this amazing lady my boss. And she's encouraging ect ect so like when I turn 21 n stuff so I can legally drink, I let her post about it. 

So we just posted we were going to a bar and celebrations would still go on in the cafe. That's all, she put our cafe address on it incase anyone wants to say congrats and move on. So, this is TOTALLY necessary but at that bar, I met Martin and he was amazing. I got drunk and since he was my bosses (Emily's) nephew, we talked and he took me home when I was wasted. We texted and dated and now are engaged but, let's rewind to when we were only talking. A few days after, he just dropped of roses for me to spark a convo which is cheesy. As we're laughing on this sow Tuesday, guess who walks through that damn door... MY SHITTY PARENTS. Yes, yes ik you guessed it probs so no suprise there. But I had a fucking heart attack, they dressed nicer, didn't have bloodshot eyes and seemed UNBOTHERED that they had a missing daughter. I had a panic attack and went on early break and went round the back. Coz Martin is Emily's nephew, she didn't mind him following me. He talked me through being strong and showing them I had an amazing life without them. He motivated me to put on a plastic smile and get myself back in there, literally and emotionally.

I servered them and GOSH they were hell. They teared up and asked for my number. Then they had the AUDACITY to ask why I left. They knew I didn't get kidnapped which makes them smart, but the fact they knew their own kid would run away made me sick.I gave them a vague, I needed to stretch my wings bs. I thought in my stupid little head, yes they might've changed, although this sounds rlly fucking fake they just might've. So I got their number and served them and I was polite. But after I physically threw up. So weeks after I guess they remembered they had to act like parents, they asked if I could 'meet the family'. Which is weird because for the 18 years they raised me, my parents sides of the family never met me.

Anways, I say no for like 4 weeks straight before agreeing. So I'm js sitting down at the rectangle table, aunties and uncles fussing over me and my parents not even paying attention. They asked the same questions, so I gave the same answers. It was really just force smiles and happiness, so I guess I told myself ""give it time"" like a delulu idiot. Like I'd say 3 years later, (yes nothing interesting rlly happened) I feel comfortable and not happy but accepted. Me and my parents meet once a month for coffee and I see the family twice a month. It's really all good, but for the past year, my parents brought up how 'complete' we were but since I'm not a pushover, I didn't take their lies and said they abused me. No one believed me, so I gave up. So ye we're at that occasional Sunday dinner (yes you probably hate that 2 words in the same sentence by now🫩), the one my family has every few months. So my parents have just about pushed the buttons and I made it this thing to bring Martin.

Now this is where shit gets real. My parents are commenting on everything and I've had enough so I talk to Martin but just use inside jokes. My parents ask what they mean and I reply it's an inside joke. And idk if they were crazy, but they idk  'remorsed' that I was gone for 4 years. Which is bs. So I deny it just like them. I'm sorry to forget but every time they used one special phrase to deny their abuse to me. So I hit them with the same 'in what world dear' they hit me with. Obviously, my mum's a narcissistic hypocrite so she cries saying she's 'doesnt deserve this' my sad cradles this like 41 yr old (yes I'm 24 and my mum gave birth at 17) like she's only 4. He kisses his teeth at me and makes it this big show to tell me 'im petty' and he leaves. Not shortly after, I leave to with Martin.

So we haven't met for coffee yet it's been a few days since we were meant to. I skipped, and guessing by them not texting, they did to. So idk what this means or how life will go, but I'll keep you posted!

My friend said that to all the abused kids (teen also), they shouldn't reconnect. Her mental health was just healing and them already set her back A YEAR. Her progress has been slowler, and so has her rising self esteem. With a wedding to plan, she just says maybe cut them off so they don't need to be included in your boat of problems. Byee👾👾

My uncle passed away in December of 2020 due to a massive heart attack. My uncle was the type to guy to take the shirt off his back to anyone. He was one of the sweetest and the kindest man you would ever meet. He was basically every younger person's uncle. Anyway, It was January of 2021 a whole month after he died. Me and my sister were showering at his house since no one lived there at the time and we had the run his water and flush the toilets so basically all the basic household needs.

Me and my sister were sitting on the couch talking about how all the memories and how we can't come here when renters come etc. Well all of a sudden, we hear a fly. Like a normal black fly that is harmless. It's January in the coldest state ever. The active fly rates are super low. So, hearing a fly and seeing a fly is RARE. So this is where things get crazy. Me and my sister are still just going down nostalgia lane and all of a sudden, the fly lands on my leg. I look at the fly and think the same thing everyone else was thinking ""HOW THE HECK WAS THERE A FLY IN THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY?

So, as a joke not actually expecting anything to happen, I start talking to the fly saying stuff like ""If you're my uncle and you love me fly up."" HE FLEW UP IM DEAD SERIOUS IT LISTENED LIKE IT WAS A DOG! Then I was like maybe it's a coincidence so I said ""If your my uncle land on my thigh."" IT LANDED ON MY THIGH RIGHT AFTER I SAID THAT. Me still being in disbelief I said ""If your my uncle land on the coffee table."" HE FREAKING LANDED ON THE TABLE! IT WAS LIKE I TRAINED THIS DAMN FLY TO LISTEN TO MY EVERY COMMAND LIKE NO HESITATION JUST LISTENED! THE FLY WAS DOING COMMANDS LIKE LANDING ON MY HAND AND SHOULDER AND TABLES!!

Me and my sister were sitting there in disbelief this all happened because 1st of all how did the fly just listen to me and 2nd of all I COULD TOUCH THE FLY! LIKE PET IT AND IT NEVER MOVED IT JUST LET ME TOUCH IT AND MOVE IT! FLYS ARE THE JUMPIEST THINGS EVER IF YOU JUST MAKE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT NEAR THEM, THEY FREAK OUT! When we left that night, we said ""goodbye uncle D we love you.""

Every other week when we went to the house. We looked up and down for the damn fly but suddenly there was no flies ever found. That's how I believe it had to be him because where did the fly go?! Then we told our mom. She believed us. But everyone else we told said we were just sad and delusional, but I genuinely think it was my uncle saying goodbye to me and my sister.",7,1769808976.0,conspiracy,4,0.89,False

1. SAFETY IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE! We anticipate this to be a peaceful event, but please read the following prior to heading downtown: https://www.hrc.org/.../tips-for-preparedness-peaceful...

2. NO GUNS OR OTHER WEAPONS! Under Alabama Code Section 13A-11-59, carrying firearms at a protest is, and has been, illegal here for a long time. (NOTE: Alex Peretti was NOT at a protest and was legally carrying a firearm when he was murdered.)

3. POLICE OFFICERS ARE NOT ICE! Please follow their directions and be kind. They are there to keep you safe. ICE agents work for the Department of Homeland Security, whereas police work for local, county, or state jurisdictions.

4. DRESS APPROPRIATELY! The high is 23 and the low is 16, but if Minnesota can do it in the winter, we can, too!

5. WARMING STATION AVAILABLE! Look for our warming station near the intersection of Governor's Drive and Gallatin. If we cannot get a spot there, we will update this feed about where we land. We will be playing music and offering FREE coffee, tea, and hot chocolate while supplies last.

6. BRING ITEMS TO KEEP PEOPLE WARM! Time to clean out that closet! Stop by our warming station to donate extra Hot Hands or other items (blankets, gloves, scarves, coats etc.) for general use. Any unused items will be donated to local advocacy programs for the unhoused.

7. SIGN-MAKING STATION AVAILABLE! We will have FREE posterboards and markers available while supplies last. The station will be located near our warming station.

8. COUNTER-PROTESTERS: You may encounter counter-protesters. Remember that they are also exercising their Constitutional rights. If they are willing to engage in productive conversation, please do so. If they only make statements meant to be inflammatory, ignore them and move on. Be the bigger person! 

9.THANK YOUR VOLUNTEERS! This is a group effort that was organized by Indivisible - 5th District North Alabama. There will be other groups with like-minded values there. Give those folks a high five!

I am looking for new friends as well as a romantic relationship, ideally both! A lot of the post is curated toward the relationship aspect as that's my main goal here but I wouldn't mind making some interesting new friends as well.

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are (this only matters if you're interested in a potential relationship with me!)...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1769808686.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

steps:

1. brew your coffee, preferably a stronger drip, espresso, or lungo. if you like a milder coffee, go for americano.
2. use honey as a sweetener, as it helps elevate, pop, and bring out the best flavors of the coffee.

* use half a teaspoon just to bring out the innate flavors in the coffee.
* use 1 teaspoon, if you want a sweet, and floral taste.
* and use 1.5 teaspoons if you want a sweet, and almost syrupy taste, and want the honey to be a key contributor to the flavor, but this much may start breaking the innate flavors of the coffee.

ensure to add the honey while the coffee is still very hot.

3. next, add a bit of cream, or milk (optional, but HIGHLY recommended).

* add 0.5 tsp of cream, to break the intensity, and help make it well rounded
* add 1tsp, to help enhance the flavor, and help make it creamy.
* add 1.5 tsp, if you like a milder, fattier, and thicker coffee, but BE CAREFUL.
* add 2 tsp, if you are crazy.
* add milk to taste, if you dont like the cream.

1. you can also add some whipped cream on top, for a latte. (i am personally not a fan.)

1qrinhs,https://i.redd.it/kjanpgai1kgg1.jpeg,Refresher Update,"Back with the energy craze, except this time it’s to the original refreshers. Coming spring, refreshers will have the option of being decaf, regular caffeine, or having extra. The caffeine still coming from green coffee extract will exist as a pump that standard is included in the refresher build, but will allow it to be removed for those looking for a decaf option along with more for those looking for that caffeine boost.

Also announced was the addition of mango syrup to our core line, with one of the featured drinks being a mango chai.

Last thing I’ll add, while it is unconfirmed and 100% my own speculation, there appears to be a third refresher in the picture they presented. Could it be Valencia Orange making a return?

1qring5,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1qring5/20260130_dull_after_the_heart_attack/,2026/01/30 dull after the heart attack,"i woke up this morning again around 7:30 but lay there just appreciating the quiet and warmth until about 8:30.  i don't think i had any really disturbing dreams since shark week is almost over and they usually coincide.  i got up and ate my [oat slop](https://imgur.com/PsixgHy) and had a [coffee](https://imgur.com/pn7JYTd).  again, just sat and really appreciated the quiet and calm and warmth of the house.  it's close to minus twenty degrees out today, so it's days like these in weather like this where i have a special appreciation for the house.  

i'm still barely on my phone or the computer right now because i don't want to see or hear anything.  all i can take is real life.  what i am doing online is job searching every day.  i'm still working on ODSP and have to make an appointment with my doctor soon.  there's an ODSP package that's supposed to be coming in the mail that i keep waiting for and checking on every day like i sent away for x-ray specks.  in the mean time, i have food, i have meds, i have shelter, i'm basic like that.  is there a chance i'll get hired any time soon?  probably not but there's no harm in trying.  again, going to check out that harvest place tomorrow and see if they want me as a volunteer for free food. 

went for the dog's noon [walk](https://imgur.com/nL9CKpj) which is short so i took my own walk afterwards.  it really is cold out today, i even turned on my [heated gloves](https://imgur.com/09iWA12), which i very rarely do because i'm not sure where to buy more batteries for them.  

if you're at walmart and you think i'm following you, i probably am.  'hey, what's up i'm not doing anything, what are you doing?  oh, you're at walmart thinking of buying a phone?  that's cool.'  also took a visit over to the [shit zoo](https://imgur.com/drzdr3L) while i was there.  didn't buy this fish, i have enough fish and i think this one was probably like $30 because petsmart sells them for crazy prices like that.  this is the type of fish i would buy for a boy.  

[lunch](https://imgur.com/wnbHszK) was asparagus on toast and an iced coffee.  i had apples sitting around that i just for whatever reason haven't been eating lately and they passed the point of being what i would consider a good eating apple so i used them for an [apple cake](https://imgur.com/Y25sd6z) since i don't do food waste.  that can be a special breakfast one day or even maybe a dessert at some point but i am working on weight loss here since it's about all i have the capacity to control right now.  it doesn't look like anything special but this is a delicious cake.  i remember the first time i made it, i'd eaten at least a quarter before it even cooled down but that's not what i'm doing today. 

i started '[house of small shadows](https://imgur.com/3r0w5Xp)' which i've read before and remember it being amazing.  adam nevill does this sort of satanic horror *so* well.  this one is a house full of taxidermy animals that are being appraised for sale because the artist who made them is renowned and long deceased but they're also incredibly creepy and infused with an almost satanic energy.  if i remember, a lot of them are rats.  they sort of run the house, which becomes its own sort of universe and you really would have to read it to understand just how incredible it is.  great premise and excellent execution.  adam nevill's other standout work, for me, is 'last days'.  another satanic horror that just hits every note.  a couple of his books have been adapted to movies but i don't think they were done justice.  i've read and seen 'the ritual' and '[no one gets out alive](https://imgur.com/pvABwXD)' and neither are his best books or were particularly good, standout movies.

what's left of the day is the evening dog walk and [dinner](https://imgur.com/ipnE1Dh), which will be soup and toast.             ",1,1769808560.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

1qrikxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qrikxq/my_house_is_haunted_by_a_bitch_ass_ghost_that/,My House Is Haunted By a Bitch Ass Ghost That Loves Dragon Ball Z,"

My name is Masie Cobb. My hair is brown and my eyes are gray. I have one hundred and forty three freckles on my nose and my cheeks and eight of them are on the tops of my lips. I am also the most unlikable, miserable sack of shit you will ever meet in your life, and yes, my house really is haunted by a bitch ass ghost that loves Dragon Ball Z. 

It wasn't always this way. Until a few years ago I was actually rather popular. I would go to the movies with my friends and we would laugh and talk in hushed tones about who was pretty and who was mean and who put on too much makeup too incorrectly. I was even favored by boys my age every now and then. They would try to make me laugh and pretend to like the music of every band that I ever wore on my shirt.

I was happy then. I showered. I was kind. 

And now there is dirt under my chipped fingernails. My lips are chapped and I let them crack and bleed, and when someone looks at or talks to me it is only because they absolutely have to do it. I haven't said a nice thing to anyone in two years, just as no one has said a nice thing to me. I am well and truly hated, and I am unrelentingly alone.

I'll tell you what happened. I *am* ashamed of it, but shame is my constant nosy companion, squeezing its way rudely into every human interaction I have, so I hardly care if I spill some of it all over my keyboard for the whole internet to see.

Ready?

Two years ago I took a brainmelting amount of LSD and ended up well and truly naked in a Chucky Cheese ball pit, doing unspeakable things to myself for everyone to see. 

You can laugh. It's a joke alright. But it's not a joke that I am playing on you, dear reader. It's a joke that the universe played on me, and it isnt all that fucking funny, is it?

Now everyone thinks I'm a… you know. 

I don't even want to say it, the thought of it is sickening to me. And I'm not. I feel like I have to say that I'm not because everyone in my fuckass shitty town knows me and thinks that I am and I can't leave.

 I am so alone. I am hated, so I spend my days hating back. I am a bitch to everyone I meet just for the small fraction of security that I get from being the first of two inevitable aggressors in any given conversation. I don't hold doors for old women. I don't say thank you, I don't tip, and If you have eaten at the Mcdonalds in Exeter, New Hampshire, you have eaten my spit.

That's why I was more annoyed than anything when I found out my house was actually haunted. Because if ghosts are real, then heaven and hell are real too, right? You could probably guess that I'm not one of those heaven girls. Maybe I could have wormed my way in there before my little incident, but now I'm sure there's a special place for me in the inferno. 

Listen, I know what you're thinking, what you wish you could tell me; “Masie! The christian God is very forgiving so why don't you just change your ways and be a sweet, nice girl so that you can go to heaven when you die?” You're probably thinking something like that, right?

No.

No way.

You couldn't understand the betrayal I feel. *Everyone* knows me and *everyone* treats me like trash. I won't be nice to them just to get into some fruity ass, self righteous, gated community in the clouds full of people who treat me like garbage. I'm going to treat everyone just how they treat me, and if that lifestyle drags me down to hell, then I'll go, kicking and screaming and spitting in big macs all the while. 

And yes the bitch ass ghost is one of those christian ghosts. I know because crosses drive him fucking nuts. Took me forever to figure that out though.

You see, after that unspeakable incident at Chucky Cheese, my decrepit father was so repulsed by me that he refused to live with me all together. He had some money stashed away from a life insurance policy on my mom and used it to buy me a ramshackle house on the other side of town. No doubt he would have sent me farther away if he could find a different place for so cheap, but the house was (and is) falling apart. How it has heat and electricity in its state is a marvel. There are entire human sized holes connecting the top floor to the bottom and absurd splatters of blood still on the floral wall paper. Which brings me to the other reason why this house was so cheap.  It was on one of those, “an entire family got brutally axe murdered here” discounts. 

They were called the Stevens. A picture of the four of them still hangs up in the living room simply because I feel like it looks kind of cool, and Im too lazy and miserable to be fucked putting up other decorations. Anyways, the story goes that one night, Mr Stevens gambled away all of his family's money and was so ashamed of it all that he decided to kill them with an axe when he went home and then shoot himself in the head for good measure. Complete pussy if you ask me. He should have just lived with it. You don't see me axe murdering my entire family just because I messed up. That type of thing is just immature to be honest with you.

 Judging from the picture on the wall, they were a nice family. It's one of those blindingly caucasian photos taken on some beach in the vineyard. Four blondies with massive, obnoxious smiles, lips peeling back from their white teeth to show off their giant gums. A little boy and a little girl and a dog and of course their dog was a golden retriever and of course they got him to look at the camera somehow. A family so perfect that it's almost obvious that they would axe murder each other. The universe craves balance, I think.

One of them is still in my fucking house.

	It took me a while to notice it. When I first moved in things would raddle, doors would slam, and the microwave would turn on for no reason, but I assumed that was just the house settling or whatever. The weird thing was that stuff like this would only ever happen when I was upstairs. Say I was upstairs in my bed. I would undeniably hear the microwave turn on, or the tv, and sprint down stairs to check it out, only for it to be off like normal when I got down there. Can you imagine how frustrating this was? Imagine *you're* upstairs in *your* bed and you swear up and down that you hear *your* tv turn on, so you run downstairs to check it and it's not. You would think you're going insane. I thought I was going insane. I thought so for a while. It seemed like the only logical next step in my life. I became a public outcast and everyone hated me, and then I began to spend all my time alone in an axe murderer's house that was falling apart. At some point I thought that becoming well and truly insane seemed like it fit logically in the downward spiral of my loser ass existence, so It wasn't long before I made peace with going nuts. Like I said, it seemed natural.

 But after my bearded dragon committed suicide I knew something was up.

I loved that thing. I remember I got him at Petco when he was just a little baby. I named him Hammy and I'm not ashamed to admit that I thought about him constantly throughout the day. I fed him lettuce and grasshoppers and the last tiny little drop of love that still floated around in my black heart, I gave to him. He was the only thing in the entire world that loved my company, that craved my touch. I would take him out of his tank and lay him on my chest and pet him and share popcorn with him while I watched romcoms and I swear he liked it.

A few times a week I would wake up in the middle of the night, scared with no real rationality, that something might have happened to him. I would stumble down stairs to check on him and adjust his heat lamp or give him a snack. More than once when I did this I would find him levitating in his tank, only for him to resume his relationship with gravity the moment I saw him. As you can imagine, I thought this was just a normal part of going insane. He seemed completely fine whenever this happened, and I liked to believe Hammy was too mature to believe in childish things like ghosts so I didn't ask him about it.

And then one day I got home from work and he was dead on the floor, with a little blood trail leading from his tank to the TV remote, where he lay dead in a poignant pool of himself. I cried all night. Loud and ugly I cried. I screamed, I bit the skin on my hand to release the pressure of it all until I tasted my own blood then I went to my kitchen and threw plates on the floor until I got too tired to stand. 

In my bed, with the lights off, I held Hammy’s limp body close to my chest and pet his head, and in the corner of my room, where the darkest shadows converged and blended together, the silhouette of a boy looked down at me.

 I looked back.

I was scared. Even If I was going insane, it's scary to see the silhouette of a shadowman in a busted ass murder house.

“Hello?” I asked softly. 

At that my bedroom door flew open and the boyish shadow slipped out into the hallway and slammed the door hard behind him.

The door had slammed. 

I saw it.

This wasn't the vague sound of the TV playing from downstairs or the absurd image of hammy floating on the teetering edge for my sub par vision. That door really slammed itself shut, My heart was still beating hard, offended by the sound of it.

Maybe my house really was haunted.

And if my house was haunted, whoever haunted it was fucking pussy. Only doing haunted shit when it thought I wasn't looking, Picking up *my* bearded dragon and putting him down right when I got there, making me think I'm insane.

What a bitch ass ghost. What was he scared of? Hes the fucking ghost. I'm just a girl, and he’s got the nerve to secretly haunt all my shit when I'm not looking, not even scaring me like he's supposed to, and then he decides to go and murder my bearded dragon?

Oh dear reader, whoever you are. I cannot explain to you everything that I felt that night, only that I sat in my bed and stewed in it all until the sun came up, and when it did, I kicked on my shoes and walked right out of the door with no coffee or anything, I didn't even put down Hammy as I went. Instead, I placed him gingerly in my hoodie pocket. I wasn't going to leave the body of my only worldly companion alone with that bitch ass ghost.

Some time later I pulled into Micheals craft store and got my hands on glue, double sided tape, and a bunch of popsicle sticks. The jowly lady at the cash register recognised me as I put my things down. I waited to see if she had the nuts to say anything, she did.

“Pervert.” she muttered softly as she looked down to finish scanning the things that I bought. I could tell she had been psyching herself up to say it.

“Thats nice, why dont you go fuck yourself?”

“Uh!” she gasped, gelatinous jowls flopping about as she jerked her head back in surprise.

“That will be twenty five ninety nine, would you like to round up one cent to charity?”

“No.”



\*\*\*

Some time later, I pulled back into my house, parked haphazardly in the driveway and stalked through the rain into my house, that was mine, and absolutely not a ghost’s if I had anything to say about it. I went up to my room, sat on my bed, threw my thin blanket over myself so that no ghosts could see what I was doing, and got to work. A few hours later I had fifty or so crosses made from popsicle sticks. I laid Hammy’s little body gently down on my bed as I stood up and began sticking those little crosses on all of the walls in my room, slowly making my way through all of the rooms upstairs and then down. 

At first, the ghost acted like nothing was happening. But as I got downstairs, things started to go haywire. Lights flickered on and off, chairs fell down, and the curtains shook harder with every new cross I stuck to the walls. The more I put up, the more everything began to bug the fuck out. If I put enough crosses up in a room, the poltergeist would move into the next room, like I had forced it out. When I made it into the kitchen, the gas stove turned on, and broken shards of porcelain dishes flew at me from the ground where I had shattered them the night before. Not hard enough to kill me mind you, but a few cut my arms and my forehead.

It really was a bitch ass ghost.

It wasn't long before I began shouting.

“How about that? You bitch ass ghost. Im got gonna stop putting these up until you get the fuck out of my house and leave me alone.”

Soon enough, I had a crosses in every room but the bathroom, and three crosses left in my hand. The bathroom door had slammed closed and the light was flickering on and off from the crack in the door. I met some resistance at the door like someone was holding it shut. So I put my crosses and tape in my pockets, wrapped both hands around the door knob, put one foot up on the wall, and with my whole body I ripped the door open easily. When I looked in the bathroom mirror, I saw why it was so easy. Standing behind my reflection, crying, was a little boy.

The boy in the family portrait. He looked the same as he did on that beach, except for a massive gaping wound in his left temple. I could see a sliver his pulsating brain. like a ball of masticated fruit gushers.

“Please stop.”

“You killed my bearded dragon.”

He was sobbing, but he kept looking at me. I guess he was sort of brave for that. He didn't look older than nine or ten.

“I know. I thought… I'm so sorry I thought that I could… I'm really so sorry, I didn't mean for him to die.”

“You thought what?”

As I said it, I waved my handful of popsicle stick crosses behind me, and in the mirror I saw him cower and shrink as they passed by him.”

“I thought that If I possessed him and made him use the tv remote, you would just think that maybe he wanted to watch tv sometimes.” he said through disgusting wet sobs.

“That doesn't make sense.”

“I know, I'm sorry, okay? I loved Hammy, just like you.”

“You killed him though.”

This made him cry even harder. His face was soaking wet with it.

“I know, I'm sorry. I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself.”

“Why didn't you just turn on the tv yourself?” I asked the little ghost in the mirror.

“B-because I thought tha-that you-you-you would exorcize me if you knew I was-s here.” 

Snot was leaking from his nose now. For a while I listened to the sounds of him cry mix with the rainstorm outside.

The silence became too much for him before it became too much for me and so he continued to let his ghostly heart bubble and froth over me through his wet little sobs.

“The truth is, I don't wanna d-die until I f-finish watching Dragonball.”

I was shocked. “Dragonball?” 

“Y-yeah. I love Vegeta so much. He's so powerful and I love it so much when he shoots his big power blast.” He was crying even harder now. “I love Vegeta so damn much. I wish I was more like him and not so scared of everything. I hate myself.”

“I-I have crunchyroll.”

He looked up at me and mopped up his tears with a bloody sweater sleeve.

“What's crunchyroll?”

Some time later, when I had taken down all the crosses from my house and thrown them outside, and Hammy was buried lovingly in the dirt outside my window with a little popsicle stick headstone, I put on my pajamas and sat on the couch. I could still hear the rain battering my flimsy wooden house as I crawled under a blanket and put on episode 86 of Dragon Ball Z. Colors and flashes barfed out of my screen as I watched stupidly. After a few episodes I felt a pressure on my shoulder, which tumbled slowly into my lap. I heard soft snoring coming from that empty void between my thighs and my chin.

Nobody had touched me on purpose for two years. I had forgotten how warm people are. How your body tingles when someone breathes on you.

 My bottom lip quivered as tears rolled down my chin and landed in mid air, on that nothing that snored in my lap.

Use with **Flux.2 Klein 9b distilled**, works as T2I (trained on 9b base as text to image) but also with editing (not something the model can't do already).

I've added some labels to the images to show comparisons between model base and with LORA to make it clear what you're looking at. I've also added the prompt at the bottom (transform prompts are used with the edit model).

Use `ch_visual_style, stick figure character` as the trigger word. Optional add more keywords to guide the style: ""flat vector art, minimalist lineart"".

P.S. If you make something cool or funny consider sharing it, I love seeing what other people make. This one has great meme potential.

We got close after we ended up in a similar after school sport and then in college we attended the same university and the same sorority. Somewhere through college we got really close but then quickly things began to fall apart. I don’t know what but it felt when we hung out she was annoyed. Or I’d ask her if she didn’t wanna do our current activity and she’d finally say yea. So I saidjust tell me we can always change plans. It’s like we didn’t communicate and things got really weird.

It’s almost like there was a feeling of competition between us. More things than just one thing but she got really close with some people in the sorority but then dropped it. And she transferred to another college some point after her and I stopped being friends: I just stopped reaching out frequently, was going through my own thing. But every time I pickedup the phone to text her, 1 month, 3 months.. etc passed by. I got the courage to write a text but the message was turning green before I even sent it (on I phone) so I figured she blocked me.

A few years post grad we connected via this local facebook group. We met up and had a lunch and coffee  and I’ve reconnected with friends before but we always kept up after. Her and I didn’t. I just got the same feeling of nerves trying to message her so I just didn’t. It’s been 2 years since that… I don’t have her socials and her number I think it’s either dead or she still has me blocked because I texted but it didn’t go through. My friend has her socials though

TLDR; 

We did everything together and I miss the good memories. I listed the stuff that went wrong but truly a lot of our friendship felt like sisterhood. Friends in childhood-high school-college. Things got weird in college and then I stopped reaching out. We rekindled briefly but didn’t keep up.",1,1769808183.0,makemychoice,4,1.0,False

He knows how to play independently but sometimes I catch myself not knowing what to talk to him about or be creative about play. I have no idea how to use my imagination and I fear this will be an issue for me when he grows up. I have never been surrounded with children and I've never generally been ""good"" with them like other people so I have no idea how to come up with games, make stuff more fun, just use my imagination in general. I love him so, so much but I'm sometimes just really awkward at this whole thing. I don't know how to make meals, play and other stuff fun and ""kid-friendly"" like other people. Some moms are so good at being moms.. does anyone have any advice for me? How can I make days more enjoyable for me and my son, since my husband works day and night and it's mostly just us two alone. How do I include him in day to day tasks? He doesn't crawl well nor walk yet so I just ride him around in his highchair if I need him close.

I know independent play is very important for them but I would really like both of us to feel like I'm more included and present in a creative, imaginative way. We have a very secure bond, I always tend to his needs right away, he's still breastfeeding, we go on walks morning and evening, we nap and sleep together, we cuddle all the time but I constantly have this feeling like I'm not doing enough and that if I leave him to play on his own while I have a cup of coffee I'm neglecting him or something. Typing this I realize it might be a little deeper 🤣😅 sorry for the little rant.

So, the other night, I (M20) was on Tinder when I matched with a girl (F19) nearby. I've been using the app for a while, and never before has meeting someone resulted in anything more than a fairly bland conversation and a little sorta coffee date once or twice. However, this girl I met last night was VERY motivated, made it clear she was very much DTF, and we ended up meeting up at her place that same night (I brought protection, don't worry). Anyways, I was super exited but also super nervous and, though she tried some wonderful things, I couldn't really keep it up or come to orgasm. This was my first time, but her third or fourth I think. I was having a great time, but my nerves were absolutely killing me, even after I'd drunk a little bit (also not in the USA, so legal). She offered me some weed, but I knew I couldn't stay the whole night and I don't smoke much so I declined that. Anyways, I still had a great time and so did she, and she was eventually able to finish just from me using my fingers inside her and she seemed to really enjoy things, even though I think she felt kinda bad for me since I was literally shaking at times with anxiety, even though I also did really enjoy it and it was a huge step for me. I've never been a very sexual person, and never hardly masturbated at all since I grew up in a somewhat morally puritanical sort of environment and was taught to view it as kinda dirty and wrong. So to go from that to what happened the other night was very intense but a lot of fun. However, she kept asking me if there was anything I'd like for her to do and I kept saying no, partially just because of the time constraint since I couldn't stay long. However, I was thinking the whole time it'd be super hot if she'd kinda take control/boss me around, sit on my face and all that kinda thing, but I wasn't able to bring myself to tell her that. I think she'd be okay with it since she tried a lot of things the other night that a lot of other girls might hesitate before doing, but still I wasn't comfortable enough to ask her. At the end of our time together, she said not to worry and that she had a good time too and I could come back someday when I have more time and can maybe hang out and relax a bit more before getting down to business. Next time I'll be sure to go over when I've no places to be the next day so we can kinda hang out and drink a bit to relax before things get underway. Does anyone here have any suggestions on how I can be a bit more ready for the next time, and can anyone say if me asking her to be more bossy/dominant would be too weird or might sour things?

It had been one of those weeks work deadlines piling up, my roommate ghosting on rent again, and my coffee machine dying spectacularly on Monday morning like it had finally given up on me. So when my phone buzzed with a text from a number I didn’t recognize, I almost ignored it, chalking it up to another random promo or bot. But the message was simply, “Need help. Can you come to the park?” and nothing else. My first thought was, *Who even texts like that?* My second was, *Why do I feel weirdly compelled to go?* After tossing the ice cream back and grabbing some microwave popcorn, I made my way to the park bench near the old fountain where the light flickered on and off and the wind whispered through the bare winter branches. I called the number. No answer. My heart thudded, half dread, half curiosity, and that’s when I saw a small, scruffy dog with a neon pink bandana trotting toward me, tail wagging like it was trying to take flight. Tied to its collar was a piece of paper with that same number and one word “Thanks?” I laughed out loud, more relieved than I expected, and texted back, “Is this your dog?” The reply came instantly: *No, but I think you found her soulmate.* Within minutes, a frantic voice approached, and a neighbor I’d vaguely seen around the block burst out of the shadows, eyes wide with gratitude. We spent the next hour sharing stories under the streetlights, the dog curled between us like an old friend. I left the park that night with a full heart, a new acquaintance, and an unexpected reminder that sometimes the best moments start with uncertainty and microwave popcorn.",1,1769807798.0,u_Critical_Rub7034,0,1.0,False

I need to talk about something I’ve never seen discussed honestly: intimacy when it’s built on something wrong.
People assume intimacy is either healthy or abusive, loving or violent. This is neither. It’s quiet. It’s familiar. And that’s what scares me the most.
My sister and I grew up inseparable. Somewhere along the way, closeness blurred into something else. There was no dramatic moment, no sudden realization — just a slow erosion of boundaries that should never have moved. By the time we understood what we were doing, we were already deep inside it.
We’re married now. There’s a baby.
When people imagine this, they imagine constant desire or obsession. The truth is more unsettling: intimacy became routine. Gentle. Domestic. Built into daily life like brushing teeth or making coffee. That normalcy is the part that makes me feel the most ashamed.
Sometimes intimacy feels like love. Sometimes it feels like obligation. Sometimes it feels like we’re both pretending not to notice the weight of what we’ve done. Neither of us talks during those moments. Silence feels safer than acknowledgment.
After the baby was born, intimacy changed. Not physically — emotionally. Every touch carries an echo of responsibility now. I can’t separate affection from consequence anymore. I look at my child and wonder what kind of truth they’ll inherit, and whether intimacy built on denial can ever be.",0,1769807756.0,confessions,10,0.38,False

I met a guy on an app and we went to coffee for a first date, mini golf for a second date, and for the 3rd and 4th dates he invited me over to his house. I’m in my mid 20’s and he’s early 30’s. He tried to initiate sex on the 4th date but I wasn’t ready and it was late so I told him I needed to leave. He invited me over for a 5th date but beforehand I texted him asking what he was looking for relationship wise and said I generally like to wait until I’m exclusive with someone and discuss STD testing before having sex with them. He responded that he’s looking for something long term and we could talk about it. 

I went over to his house for the 5th date and he brought it up and he said that he usually sleeps with people before becoming exclusive but that he always uses condoms and wasn’t worried about having an STD and wasn’t worried about me having anything either. I told him that sexual compatibility is important to me and I’m not trying to withhold sex for any reason other than being concerned about getting an STD and him potentially sleeping with others at the same time. He told me he’s slept with people since he last got tested but always used condoms. He said he can’t tell if I really like him and he thinks having sex would fix that. We didn’t really get anywhere with the conversation. When we went to his room and started making out I told him I was on my period which was true, he didn’t push back that hard but said “you know I don’t care that you’re on your period” but I told him I didn’t want to and he didn’t push it further. 

6th date we went out to dinner (which I suggested) and then went back to his place after. We started making out while watching a show and he put his hand down my pants and told me to take off my shirt. We were in the middle of a show so I told him we should finish it first and after it ended it was late and I told him I needed to leave. He responded “is there a problem here” and said I seem standoffish and he wants a relationship where there’s passion. He seemed frustrated that we haven’t had sex yet. I reiterated to him that I had said before I’d like for him to get tested before we sleep together. He said he had been tested like a year and a half ago but I think he just made it up based on how he said it. I told him I didn’t have any big hang ups about sex I just value my health and once I’m in a relationship where we’ve been tested I’m very much into sex. We started making out again and he put his hand down my pants again and I told him to stop. He said he just wanted to finger me and we didn’t have to go all the way but I told him no and he didn’t push any further. Afterwards he said he would get tested and I would too. He texted me after that he had a good time but now I’m not sure if I should see him again. Asking in this sub to get men’s opinions on it, does it seem like he wants something long term or is he just in it for sex?

Reposting because it intially got taken down for the redit filterm and I'm desperate for advice. Also most of my community hasn't been through a breakup before so I needed some people who understand:). This story is really long so I'll do my best to be clear but it's got alloot of history. I'm just feeling really lost but want to do what's the most mature thing. So for context, there's a lot of background to this situation. I am in a pretty small community of Christians from the college I went to. It was a really unique experience because there were like less than ten people total per yearly class and a small staff. We all became super close because of this. One of the girls and I (21F) became super close our first year, let's just say her name is Sara.(23F) We were so close that if she ever had rough day, we would have sleepovers and cook dinner for each other and made so many promises to each other that our friendship was one that would be our whole lives. She felt like my person. (I knew talking like that was naive in the moment but I just really loved her a lot) It felt like we could connect on everything and I've never felt so seen and loved and chosen. Flash forward to our second year of school. Sara unexpectedly stopped connecting with me and when I would reach out to hang out she either said she was too busy or when we would make plans cancel like 30 min before we were supposed to see each other. I didn't know what changed but tried to assume the best. At the end of our second year I asked her if we could have a conversation about why our relationship became so distant all of a sudden and expressed how painful it was to not know why she wasn't reaching out to connect anymore. Come to find out there was a rumor I didn't know about me being spread that I was practicing witchcraft. That she believed. I was like ""girl what?"" Now, I don't mess with that and every person in my life I've told this to has literally been shocked and confused as to why she said that. So obviously a lot of trust was broken. Learning that a year of really deep friendship got thrown to the side because of a rumor that she didn't just believe out of the blue but didn't tell me was being said about me. But she apologized and because I love her so much I wanted to see our relationship heal after this.

During this time I was going through a breakup with a guy I dated for a year, he was my first serious boyfriend and it was really intense. She was having boy troubles with her boyfriend as well and we spent that summer processing together on phone calls that lasted hours. When school started up for our third and final year, she went through a really intense breakup and was in a lot of pain because of it. I was the only person in our community that had been through a breakup before and was there with ice cream and dinner and long evening talks. 2 days after she told me about their breakup, she started disappearing from group Hangouts with my ex-boyfriend and hanging out him, asking him to buy a stuffed animal for her, getting coffee etc. I was so hurt and did not show up well to conversation where I expressed how painful it was to have her be so close to my ex-boyfriend especially when we were working on a lot of lost trust in her and i's relationship. I didn't accuse her of anything but I was really angry and it totally showed up in my voice. I genuinely feel awful about this. A lot of people thought it was unfair that I would say I couldn't be friends with her if she was going to be pursuing a friendship with my ex-boyfriend. They are both really friendly people. And I can see how I messed up here. It just was so painful for her to know all the ways that he disrespected me in our relationship and still choose him over me frequently. Okay, so a few months later I apologize. A few months later she apologizes And in a 3-hour conversation I express that I don't think that either of us had the emotional capacity to repair all that had been broken(we both were doing school full time) and because she was too special to me, I didn't think I could weather it if our relationship broke again and I said I didn't think we could be friends. Of course we still treated each other politely and interacted well. I even helped her process a few other situations when they came up. Now to the situation at hand. Thank you for reading this far!

So I dated another guy(23M) for about 8/9 months. It ended pretty mutually, essentially we just weren't a right fit. But I was his first relationship in three years and he was the first, what I thought at the time, really mature guy I had dated this far. I find out from a mutual friend a month after our breakup up, he's moved on with Sara two weeks after we broke up. I didn't tell him much about her and I's relationship because they were friends before he and I dated and didn't want to influence that. But he did know she was a really painful relationship and once I even had a dream he cheated on me with her and when I brought it up just to share where my heart was at he was silent and we just moved on. I have no idea how long he's had feelings for her. I don't know what to do because I feel completely blindsided and people in my community also think that it's super strange, but I feel so undefended because it seems like the attitude is ""But I love all three of you!"" And she's been telling people that I told her ""I didn't want to be her friend."" Not the rest of our story. I feel really powerless. And deeply betrayed. I moved back home, states away. To try to get on with my life. But there's a wedding in a few months and I'm a bridesmaid with her in and both of my ex's will be there🤦🏼‍♀️ do any of y'all have any advice on how to process this and move forward? it's really hard to hear forgiveness because I feel I'm forgiving them for a new thing everyday. I also know it just takes time. This is a lot to share but it feels so spiraly and I'm wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation. What would you do/ what did you do?

I’m 27F and hoping to find a good friend who values quality over quantity when it comes to friendships. (Super tired of the surface level/high school drama friendships) I’m really looking for something intentional—someone who actually wants to put in the effort to build a strong, comfortable friendship where we can drop the masks and just be ourselves.
I love thrifting and antiquing (honestly could do it all day), preferably with delicious coffee involved. I’m very into crafting and sewing, and a perfect night for me is hot tea, a good show, and something creative in my hands. I also have a long list of interests, but a few favorites are DIY projects, sewing, organizing my Pinterest boards, and gaming.
I’d love a friend who’s down to hang out often—coming over to mine or yours, doing little crafts, getting lost in snacks and conversation, that kind of vibe. I also really value affordable ways to hang out. Bars and restaurants are fun sometimes, but I love Radpass, free events around Pittsburgh, crafting nights, and finding cheap or creative alternatives to spending money just to spend time together.

for some context: i was born in the philippines but moved to the usa when i was an infant, and my parents never taught me tagalog so i only speak english. i've visited the philippines three times since then, always as part of big family trips where i'm not a part of the planning and i just tag along, chaperoned to and from planned activities and visits with extended family without having to arrange transportation, hotels, or anything in the itinerary. we usually island hop a lot during these trips, visiting manila, the provinces, and tourist destinations like boracay and palawan. 

my sister is having her wedding in boracay in march, and for the first time i'll be visiting the philippines without my parents or extended family dictating the itinerary and chaperoning me around. my partner grew up in the united states and this will be their first time visiting the philippines. we will be staying at the wedding resort in boracay for much of the trip, but before and after that, we will be spending a few days in manila. 

i know that manila and tourist spots like boracay are not like the provinces, so my partner won't really get to see what life in the philippines is really like, but i still want to show them my family's culture. i'd appreciate any suggestions for our itinerary while in manila, like areas to explore, hotels to stay at, or activities/places to try!

some additional considerations:

-my partner is vegetarian and allergic to a lot of fruits. i know we could buy food from grocery/convenience stores, but any suggestions for places to eat that are good with dietary restrictions? since they eat no meat or fish and have a deadly allergy to pineapple, this is a main concern. 

-we are both gender non-conforming, but people see us as women. we're also in our late 20s. any tips for safer areas or areas to avoid? we would also love to visit places of interest for LGBTQ people if those exist!

-we're open to new experiences and don't have specific activities in mind. we aren't very active with exercise or sports, but we like music, arts/crafts, unique activities/experiences, and window shopping (not very interested in high-end, luxury, or designer brands, but i'm definitely willing to support local artisans even with higher prices). usually when i travel, i love checking out outdoor markets selling clothes, arts, trinkets, and street food. my partner likes checking out local coffee shops/cafes. i was thinking of staying in bgc because we love cats and i know they have a lot of street cats, but we've been to many cities and bgc seems like it'll just be another city without as much filipino charm or culture. any suggestions based on our interests?

-i'm looking to keep things affordable, but i don't have a specific budget limit and i'm willing to spend extra to make sure we have a good time. 

i'd also love to hear any general travel tips that you think might be useful-- i'm really nervous since i want my partner to have a good time and i've never planned my own philippines trip before. thank you so much in advance!!",1,1769806995.0,PhilippinesTravel,0,1.0,False

A little about me: like I said, early 20s, almost two years out of college, and I've spent the majority of my life living in Michigan. Particularly small towns with a very close knit community, so moving to a big city for the first time far away from family is a little intimidating as you might imagine! 

My grandparents lived in Arlington when I was young, I'd say the last time I was in DC was around 2012. So not a *completely* new place, but I've never been solo/as an adult and obviously it has changed through the years. 

I've been looking at Dupont/Logan Circle area quite a bit (but I'm open to others!). I'm looking for easy walking to coffee shops, stores, restaurants, bars, etc. Hopefully somewhere with a lot of other young professionals. I'm an artist and musician in my spare time so a creative/artsy vibe is appreciated. I'm also a member of the LGBTQ+ community (specially the L) and love going to local drag shows, so having those close by would be a dream as well as any other queer-centric spaces. 

A big concern for me is safety and I've heard mostly good, some bad which seems pretty standard for a big city. My question is, is Dupont Circle/Logan Circle actually somewhere to worry or just the typical 'be aware of your surroundings, don't be an idiot' vibe? 

Any other general tips are very welcome, especially if you're someone who moved from a small town to DC! ",1,1769806827.0,washdc,2,0.67,False

***Prologue - Widening Gyre***

  


*With tongue of Fool's Gold she makes promises*

*Through Brazen teeth and lips of quicksilver…* 

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge

  


His chest felt like it would explode from the relentless onslaught of the wrecking ball within, determined to raze its way through. His knees suddenly felt weak. Before his teary eyes, the typed letters congealed into a stringy, black mass of decay as if the 15-inch screen at which he stared was rotting from its center. He had just opened his laptop and the words, “I loved having you in my bed last night…” were forever emblazoned in the depths of his psyche. He wasn’t the author of these raunchy messages. No, this was some bozo talking to his wife. 



Over the last few months, he had noticed a familiar hostility from her that reminded him of past experiences, only now remembered, her attitude toward him growing more and more frigid by the day. He felt a nagging suspicion that her family had turned her against him. Sure, he had made more than his fair share of mistakes in recent memory, and money was often found wanting in his pocket. However, he felt there was something more to this intensifying ire, and was determined to get to the bottom of it. What did he resort to? Hacking his wife’s phone. Just hours ago, he had paired his wife’s WhatsApp with his laptop using WhatsApp Web, and now he could see all of her incoming and outgoing messages on his browser.



Believe it or not, even though this wasn’t the first time this had happened, he had not expected to find out that Joy was, in fact, cheating on him with her father’s tenant. To say that the world had crashed around him would not even come close to encapsulating the depths of his pain. In that one moment, Emmanuel, as the world knew him, was gone.



The years seemed to fold back on themselves like pages of a book blown by the wind, and suddenly, Emmanuel found himself back at his in-laws’ house, where they lived in the earlier years of their marriage. It had been a sunny day, but the brightness could not quite penetrate the gloom he had been wrapped in. For the last two weeks, it had been fight after fight over money, or rather the lack thereof. The intensity of the arguments reached baffling heights, increasing with each encounter. 



*But why?* Emmanuel thought, shaking his head. *Can’t she see that I’m fighting with everything I’ve got? We don’t have money, but surely she can’t just write my current situation off as permanent.*



As he replayed last night’s skirmish over and over in his head he couldn’t help but descend further into confusion as images of her berating him in short, devastating utterances punctuated by such confessions as, “I feel like such a failure,” and, “I’ve failed my family!” Even more baffling was her response to his reassuring words. 



“Joy, you haven’t failed anyone. As far as I can tell, you haven’t given up. As long as you keep fighting, how can you say that you’ve failed?” “You don’t know what I’m going through. Everything is on me, and I’m not getting any help from you.” “Joy, how can you say that? We started this business together. When we saw that the business needed time to grow, we both agreed that I would step aside from the business and find other ways to raise money for family expenses so that the business has a chance to bounce back. How can you say that you’re not getting any help from me?” “We still owe Gift's school fees. How is that helping me?” *You seem to have forgotten the portion that I did pay.* 



For some reason, he couldn’t bring himself to say that last bit out loud. Instead, he just kept quiet as he seethed inside, spiraling in despair. He looked at her face through the veil of tears that seemed to insulate her from reality. Or was it the other way around? *Am I missing the plot somewhere?* 



Now, as he sits alone in the bedroom they shared, Emmanuel is wrapped up in this internal rant. The door opens, and Joy appears with a somber expression on her face. “Manu, can we talk?” Her expression did not betray any hostility on her part. She looked almost humble, for lack of a better word. It was also not lost on him that this was the first time she had used this nickname for him in months. *An olive branch, perhaps?* “Okay. Let’s talk.” “Could we take a walk outside while we talk?” 



A spark of hope immediately lit up his face. Could this be a romantic gesture? *Does she want to drop the fighting and just be happy with me?* Emmanuel was already flying high at the thought. As he followed her out the door, he took the initiative to hold her hand as they walked, trying to signal to her that he was fully on board with this turn of events. 



They slowly walked around the lush garden in silence for a few moments. Joy’s expression remained somber, troubled, almost. Emmanuel was thinking of how to break the ice when Joy spoke up. “I have something I need to confess to you. Could we sit down here?” She gestured toward an avocado root that had, years before that moment, jutted out of the ground, traveled almost a meter, then took a nosedive back into the depths of the earth. Manu sat down first, then she took her spot next to him. 

Another moment of silence ensued as she fiddled with her rainbow-colored dress that hugged her curves in a way that always drew Manu’s attention to her very attractive body. Her lower lip began to quiver slightly before finally launching into her speech. 



“Manu, I did something terrible. Working so closely with Joshua, we formed a friendship. I started sharing with him my frustrations about the situation with the business and how I had put all my hopes into it for the sake of our livelihood. He also shared details about his life and the troubles he had with his marriage. One thing led to another, and I had sex with him.” 



At that moment, Manu froze. It had quickly registered in his mind what she had just said, but he sat there and waited for the wave of rage, resentment, devastation, sadness, shock, and all the other emotions he couldn’t think of at that moment to wash over him, overwhelming him. It didn’t come. 



In that moment of silence, Joy rushed to say, “I’m so sorry! I regret having ever done it. I will understand if you never want to have anything to do with me now.” 



Manu started to rock back and forth as he looked blankly at the eastern horizon, conscious of the reddening sun behind him. His gaze veered off to the left and noticed for the first time in the two years that he lived there, a cactus fruit plant beginning to flower. 



Joshua was known to Emmanuel from the time he was 15 years old. They saw each other at annual church gatherings as members of local music departments in different cities. He had gotten involved with the couple’s business as a friend and investor who wanted to help them bring their snack manufacturing business from the brink of bankruptcy after a series of unfortunate miscalculations. 



Because of their shared experience in church and passion for worship through song, Manu regarded Josh as a trusted friend, and even a mentor. He had never expected him to make a move on his wife, much less have sex with her. ‘*I guess the joke’s on me.’*



“Manu, please say something.” “How long has this been going on?” His tone was flat, his blank gaze set straight ahead. “Two weeks… more like 10 days. I put an end to it a few weeks ago. I couldn’t bring myself to hide it from you. You don’t deserve any of this. Josh tried to convince me not to tell you, but I could not do it. I love you.”



“Where did you do it?” “It happened 3 times. It was in the car after everyone else had left.” Manu didn’t even know why he asked that question. He didn’t want to know the sordid details. Now he had to deal with the image of the two of them in the back seat of the car he used to go to the store, do the school run… go to church. *Where the hell is my reaction?*



“Manu, I’m sorry. It was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. We were going through some hard times, and there was Josh offering an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on. I couldn’t control the situation...” A dull thud reverberated briefly as Manu’s fist made contact with the tree root they were sitting on. “Joy, don’t sit there and act like you didn’t have a choice. You always have a choice. You chose to get in that car and do whatever it was that you did. It’s on you.”



Another brief moment was spent in silence. Finally, Emmanuel asked, “What do you want to do now?” “Could you find it in you to give me another chance?” More silence. 



*Come on, man, where’s my rage? She shouts at me for the most trivial things. She goes ballistic over the power going out. Here she hooks up with Josh, and what? Nothing. What the hell, Manu!* “I need a few minutes on my own. I’m going to the bedroom.” Joy’s gaze lowered to the ground as she gave a slow nod. 



As Manu sat at the foot of the bed, he agonized over his response (or rather, the lack thereof) to Joy’s revelation. *Cry! Scream! Laugh! SOMETHING!* He waited. Silence. *Just forgive her. You have two kids with her. Just forgive her. Keep the secret. She won’t do this again.* 



“Joy!” He called out into the darkening hallway. After a moment’s pause, Joy came to the door. He gestured for her to sit on the bed. She absentmindedly bit her lower lip as she sat down next to him with her head bowed down. Instead of looking him in the eye, she looked at him sidelong.  



“I forgive you.” Her expression remained somber, although her eyes did light up. “Thank you so much. I promise never to let you down or break your trust…” Her voice trailed off as if she were hesitating to say something. “Manu, I will stay here at home. I won’t go anywhere. I’ll always be here at home so you know what I’m doing all the time…” “No. I’m your husband, not a cop. I can’t be policing you day and night.”



“Thank you, Manu. It sounds strange, but you saying that makes me feel closer to you.” “You gave away what’s mine. NEVER do that again. Do you understand? We are going to keep this between us. No one is going to know.” “Thank you, Babe. I’m sorry. I promise I won’t do it again. I’ve cut off all ties with Josh.” “Don’t ever mention that name to me again.” Manu’s face twisted in a scowl at the thought of the person whom he had just discovered was not his friend. 



“I’m sorry. I won’t mention it again.” She stood up, “I’ll leave you alone now.” Manu quickly stood up behind her, reached over her shoulder, and pushed the door closed. He grabbed her by the arm and turned her around to face him. As he pushed her back against the door, he whispered, “Where are you going with what’s mine?” *This feels all kinds of wrong. Manu, get a grip! Don’t debase yourself. She cheated on you. Don’t do this!* He kissed her deeply. *This is how I’ll forgive her. This is how I’ll reassure her she’s forgiven. This is how I end this nightmare.* He flung her on the bed and made love to her.



Later that night, Emmanuel lay in bed looking up at the ceiling. The hollow sensation he felt in his chest only served as a reminder of the abyss he felt tugging at the pit of his stomach. Had he just torpedoed any chance he had at true happiness? Was he doomed to a life of rage, jealousy, humiliation, grief, and agony all compressed into the singularity now crushing him from within? 



*Time will make this better, Manu. It will all die away with time. Don’t worry so much.* But it wasn’t fair, was it? She gets to scream at him for all his transgressions. And he can’t even bring himself to even suggest he was disappointed in her for any reason? *But she still loves me. I am going to fight for our marriage to work. We’ll come out of this stronger.* This was his last coherent thought before the blissful oblivion of sleep overshadowed him. 



No sooner had the blackness taken over than the break of day jarred him to the waiting reality that was his marriage. *Just love her. If you can just love her, everything will be alright.* His assuring words rang hollow, yet a steel-like resolve set within him. If he could just be that much stronger, hang on that much longer, try that much harder, he could make this the happy marriage he promised Joy before they tied the knot. 

Now, as he reads the racy messages flashing across his laptop’s screen, the image of her lying naked on the bed before him as he rushed to forgive her that day lingered in his mind’s eye, and his heart began to disintegrate to the rhythm of his pounding head. *What the hell? Manu, what the hell were you thinking?*



***Chapter 1 - Turning Tables***



*Where sweaty brow finds rest on barren breast*

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge



As Manu sat in front of his laptop, the reality of Joy’s affair finally solidified. No, there was no way he could be misinterpreting the messages. But what was he to do? Go charging into their bedroom where he knew she was, throw the messages in her face, and demand an explanation? The prospect of a confrontation threw Manu into inexplicable fear. His heart assaulted his chest as though he sat face to face with a pack of hyenas ready to pounce on him, rip his body limb from limb, and devour him, screaming bloody murder. 



*‘Manu, just go in there and confront her. Get it done! Now!’* Despite his internal urge for resolution, Manu sat there frozen, not knowing what to do. As rage built up within him, he found himself pacing all over the open-plan common area of the two-bedroom apartment they lived in. It was as though he thought he might find relief from the weight that seemed to physically crush his heart by looking for it as one would look for his misplaced keys between the sofa cushions. He walked to the opposite sofa and sat down, rocked back and forth, went to the kitchen, turned on the kettle to make some coffee, forgot about the coffee, went to open the fridge… Anything to avoid opening that bedroom door. A tear formed at the corner of his right eye as the shame of his spinelessness washed over him. *‘How can I be this useless? How can I sit here and just take it? Am I really afraid of her?’* He quickly wiped it away as an idea came to him. If he could initiate a seemingly innocuous conversation about household affairs and steer it in such a way that her indiscretions come to light, he would be able to ease into the confrontation without making a scene.



Abandoning the notion of open confrontation, he took his own phone and started messaging his wife. As far as she was concerned, Manu was busy with his freelance work, so a WhatsApp message from him, even though they were in the same apartment, wasn’t unusual.



***Manu:***	***Hey. By the way, how much do we owe Roland?*** 



Roland was the tenant who was living in Joy’s father’s house while he was working abroad. Joy had gotten a loan from Roland to assist Manu, who was out of town frantically trying to sell the produce they had bought in bulk before it all spoiled. In the end, despite all efforts, the produce all went bad and the couple was left with a pile of rotten produce and no small amount of debt. It was to this loan that Manu referred. 



***Joy:***	***Why?*** 



Manu could already sense Joy’s apprehension.



***Manu:***	***I just wanted to see what the balance is. I don’t want to lose track.”***



***Joy:***	***I’ll have to check.***



No sooner had that message come through on Manu’s phone than all messages to and from Roland started disappearing on his laptop screen. ‘*Damn it! Now I have no evidence. Even if I wanted to confront her, I can’t!’* Frustration threatened to consume Manu. He calmed himself down, deciding to bide his time. ‘*Eventually, she will calm down, and I’ll catch her again*. *When that happens, I’ll be ready.’* 



The days went by slowly as Manu did his best to act like everything was normal. Nothing was normal. Every waking moment, Manu’s thoughts were inextricably tethered to his smartphone. Ever since he had almost blown his cover, he decided to move his spying interface to his smartphone so as to evade detection. The messages between Joy and Roland had changed in tone. It became apparent that Joy had decided to be careful about what she said in her messages. A week went by of school runs, failing to concentrate on work, and checking the phone every few minutes. By the time Friday came along, Manu’s mind had begun to unravel and was teetering on the brink of insanity, although he wasn’t sure if he was still on the side of sanity. 



It was a Thursday afternoon. Joy had come home from work early, and they were lying side by side on their bed. Joy was checking messages on her phone, while Manu was wrapping up with a client online. 



“I had an idea. I was talking to my mom yesterday, and she was telling me about how clothes are cheap in Algeria. I did some quick calculations and saw that I could quickly raise money for rent and start paying Roland back without much difficulty by stocking up on clothes and selling them here in Milton Park. It’s quick money, and I think in one trip, I can take care of both before going back and restocking for school fees for the boys.” 



Manu raised a brow and asked, “Even after you take the plane ticket and duty into account?” “Yeah. After everything is said and done, I can spend $6,000 on stock, plane ticket, and duty, and come out with two months’ worth of rent, as well as another $6,000 to do it over again.”



“Okay. But where are we going to get the $6,000 to start?”



“I was thinking of using Mom’s car as security for a loan. I park the car at the loan company’s premises, and they’ll give me the money.”



“Joy, this is a bad idea. Does Mom know that’s what you’re planning?” 



“No. I figure I could do 2 rounds and pay back the loan well within the grace period.”



“Don’t do it. This will backfire. Unless you get Mom onboard with it.” Manu was incredulous. ‘*Are we really having this conversation?’*



“You give me the money, then. Give me the rent money and Roland’s money as well as the school fees that we owe.”



Manu fell silent, stunned at Joy’s response. “If you do this, I will have nothing to do with it. You’re doing this all on your own without my blessing.”



“I slept with someone else to get grocery money.” 



It was as if a beast was inside Manu’s chest, clawing its way out. ‘*Manu, if you have ever been told the truth, this is it.’* Joy took a moment to observe Manu’s reaction. “Do you believe it?” Joy’s challenging tone broke Manu out of his musings. 



“No,” Manu didn’t want to be drawn into the confrontation that he almost knew Joy was trying to draw him into. *‘Does she know that I know what she’s up to?’*



“What makes you so sure?”



“I know you wouldn’t do such a despicable thing.” Inwardly, Manu cringed as he uttered this lie. He knew for a fact that that’s exactly what she had done. Rage, guilt, shame, and humiliation all combined in that instant to form the corrosive compound that was now liquifying his sense of value and manhood from the inside. ‘*For now, I’ve got to take it. Endure for now. Vindication will come eventually.’*



Seeing that there was nothing more to be said about what he thought about Joy’s ‘crazy’ idea, Manu quietly went back to checking his messages, still reeling from the tempestuous exchange they’d just had. Several minutes went by when Joy casually asked, “Can I borrow your phone? I need to check something.” Emmanuel handed over the phone without hesitation, as he wasn’t really able to focus on what he was doing anyway. This was a decision he would soon regret, as within a few minutes, Joy asked him, “Are you spying on my phone?” Manu’s heart stopped. The confrontation he was planning to build up to had now come crashing down on him in an instant. 



Manu’s split-second hesitation only cemented in Joy’s mind that she had hit the nail on the head. “I can’t believe you! This whole time you’ve been reading my messages?” They had both stood up now; Manu’s posture taking on that of a supplicant toddler caught doing something he knew was wrong and needing the shouting to turn into forgiving hugs. “I’m doing everything I can to support you. You. My husband, who promised me a house on the hill. I’m feeding you, paying the rent, sending *your* kids to school! Yet this whole time you’ve been…” she struck the wall to her left as if it was all she could do to avoid striking her husband ""... SPYING ON ME!?"" The violence sent a jolt of paralyzing fear through Manu that he really hoped did not show in his face, or the slight flinch at her physical outburst. 



“You know, what you did was illegal, right?” A flash of disbelief swept over Manu as he processed that last utterance. Was this really her takeaway from this situation? “You’d better pray I don’t take you to the cops. I can’t sleep under the same roof as you. I don’t know where you’re going to sleep tonight, but it definitely won’t be here.” ‘*This isn’t how this is supposed to go down. Why is this happening?’*



A few hours later, the children came home from school. “Dad!” Manu jumped at the sound of Gift’s voice. He realized with embarrassed horror that he had been staring blankly at the wall and had forgotten that he had been reading a math problem when he had trailed off mid-sentence. He looked at his son, the shape of his face and golden bronze complexion echoing the visage that had been the object of his every teenage daytime reverie, but the confident gaze he was certain came from his sister, Faith. After struggling through the rest of the assignment with Gift, Manu retreated to the bathroom. 



Once he had locked the door, Manu wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. The tears that had been threatening to burst through the dam wall manifested themselves like damp creeping up from under the foundation. No shoulder-shaking shudders. No quiet, teary sniffles. He looked up toward the ceiling, and his gaze fell on the curtain rail in the shower. 



A terrible calm came over him. He pushed back the shower curtain to reveal the gleaming metal. *‘Will I learn anything on the other side of this rail?’* The thought terrified Manu on a level of consciousness that strangely seemed inaccessible to him in that moment. He watched almost helplessly as the belt came off his waist, looped itself through the buckle, a simple knot materializing around the cold metal rod. The sensation of putting the makeshift noose over his head was like being dipped headfirst into a bucket of water. As he knelt on the floor, he realized that he had to almost lie down to tighten the loop around his neck. He felt the world slipping away. With a jolt, he stood up. *‘Am I really doing this?’* Manu was almost embarrassed at the hesitation. *‘Manu, you’re not seriously thinking of doing this, are you? You know you want to live,’* Manu thought. ‘*Who are you kidding? You’re not going to go through with this? You can’t even work up the nerve to confront your wife; what more your Maker?’* Yet, once more, Manu found himself on his knees. A few more times, Manu stood up again. He did this again and again until he lost count. He didn’t even notice he had slipped away. As the world started to fade back into existence, he found himself on the shower floor. The shower curtain draped over his head, and the rail that had kept it up lay mangled next to his head. Realization began to dawn on him with a gripping terror. He would have been - no - should have been dead had it not been for the rail giving out under the stress of his full body weight. He had actually tried to end his own life. *‘Manu, what the hell are you doing?’* 



He tried his best to straighten the rail and put the curtain back, but it wouldn’t straighten all the way. Giving up, he folded up the shower curtain and stuffed it in the corner of the room that would be behind the door when it opened. He straightened his clothes, checked his facial expression in the mirror, then strode into the living room to find Joy sending Gift, Manly, and Victor to bed with a hug and a kiss each. When they saw their father, they all ran to him at once. “Good night, Dad!” Seeing their innocent smiles almost broke him down, but he kept his composure, managed a smile, and knelt to take them all into a bear hug. He felt his stomach twist, realizing it could have been Gift who discovered his lifeless body in the bathroom. Manu could not bring himself to imagine a world where he could be forgiven. 



As the children went to the bathroom before bed, Joy came up to Manu and whispered, “You were in there a while. What were you doing?” It shocked Manu how easily the words came out, “I’m sorry. I tried to hang myself in there. The rail gave out, and that’s the only reason we’re having this conversation.” A beat. Two beats. Three. The moment seemed to stretch for an eternity. “Manu, this just makes me clearer on me not wanting you around. I can’t believe you did that! Do you realize you could have completely devastated the kids? Now I’m wondering if having you around them is a good idea. In any case, this is all the more reason to have you out of the house. 

Joy started to gather her handbag, jacket and keys. “Let’s go.” They got into the car, and she drove toward Manu's dad's house on the other side of town. The 30-minute journey passed in an oppressive silence; the kind of silence in which your own thoughts slowly intensify the burden in small, excruciating increments in the same way that a corpse would bear the burden of earth thrown shovel by shovel. 



Arriving at Manu’s Dad’s house evoked a strange mix of pride for his father, shame for his failures, and dread for the moment of revelation as to why he was there. Using his own key, Manu opened the front door as man and wife let themselves into the house. 



Walking up the stairs in the grand entrance, Manu had a strange feeling of nostalgia as his gaze fell upon the huge Chinese vases that looked like naturally occurring outcrops in this indoor landscape forged into reality by the quiet genius that was his mother. He took pride in the fact that it was this force of nature that, with no architectural background, sketched the floor plans and prayed it into reality. ‘*The owners of this house are dreamers,’* Manu thought. ‘*Where did I miss it?’*



Honorable Judge Godgiven Kingsbow, besides being Manu’s father, had, and always would be, a towering figure in Manu’s mind. In the days of his youth, he had met Desire Riverland, the force of nature who would later become Manu’s mother. Together, they would compose songs of worship and devotion to God that had the nation singing, not only in churches, but at family gatherings, funerals, and weddings. They would go on to marry and build a life together. 



Emerging from his bedroom in his pajamas and plush bathrobe, Godgiven’s face was a canvas of surprise, confusion, and, dare Manu say, annoyance he didn’t have time to attempt to contain. “Hi Dad,” Manu tried, still coming up the stairs, cowering behind a smile meant to hide the humiliation coursing through his veins. “What’s going on?” Manu froze for a beat at the thought of having to launch into the reason for their appearance before even making it to the top of the stairs. “Come in! Come in!” he said, gesturing for them to walk into his bedroom, quickly dispelling the awkward energy before it suspended the three of them in a cocoon of temporal stasis, making the top of the stairs an unattainable summit.



With a sigh of relief that he immediately wished he had suppressed, Manu hastily completed his approach and gave his father a quick sidelong hug as he pushed past him into the master bedroom; Joy mimicked Manu’s actions with a nervous chuckle as she followed him up the remaining stairs, giving Judge Kingsbow a perfunctory hug as she made her way through the door. 



“Have you already done the needful?” Manu asked as he made his way to the kettle. He could feel Joy rolling her eyes as she witnessed Manu falling into the mundane habit of ‘doing the needful’, a code phrase for making tea, as was the custom of the house. “I’ve already had my tea, Manu, but feel free to make yourselves a cup.” “I’m not having any,” Joy said, almost too quickly. Manu, because he had his back turned, allowed a fleeting mask of rage to cover his visage at the assumption that he intended to serve her at all. It was gone as quickly as it had appeared, and he managed to offer a neutral facial expression to the world before he turned back around, kettle hissing in his wake.



“Is Mom still in Mazoe?” Joy asked. “Yes, she’s supervising the planting of this year’s crop,” the judge supplied with a dismissive wave of his hand. “So tell me,” he began, quickly steering the conversation, “To what do I owe the pleasure?” Manu, feeling it was his responsibility to get the ball rolling on this conversation, suddenly found his jaw had been wired shut, his shoes riveted to the newly tiled floor, and his eyes opened wide such that his face took on the expression of one he imagined had been subjected to King Chaka’s signature impalement method. Thankfully, without even looking at him, Joy intervened, “Dad, I think this is something that Manu has to tell you himself, alone.” The Judge’s eyebrows came together as he began to parse the information conveyed in Joy’s cryptic utterance. 



“Well, I’ll leave you guys to it,” she said, quickly picking up her handbag.  “Oh, you’re leaving?” Godgiven was visibly surprised. “Yes,” Joy offered with an apologetic smile and another nervous chuckle, picking up her handbag and making for the door. Before he could even give Manu a confused look, Joy was already on her way back down the stairs and opening the front door. “Go lock up after her,”  Godgiven instructed, resignation evident on his face, “then come back so you can tell me what’s going on.” 



With a nod, Manu went down the stairs. Thankfully, by the time he reached the door, Joy was already starting the engine and reversing out of the carport. The front door had been left slightly ajar, as without a key, one could not properly close the door. He closed the door, engaged the locking mechanism, turned around, and with head bowed, slowly marched his way up the stairs to face his father. 



***Chapter 2 - A Time, Times, and Half a Time***

*…Blindly leap from cliff to precipice*

*Boldly dive into the lofty brightness*

*Of glorious darkness beneath the Earth…*

* From ‘Greed’ by Member In Charge



As Manu approached the first step, his mind began to travel through time, back to the day he met Joy for the first time. He had just managed to get around to tackling his holiday assignment. It had been a struggle to get started on this project, as he had been so preoccupied with creating more music over the summer. Necessity was the gravity that brought him abruptly to the unforgiving surface that was reality, and as much as he wanted to spend more time in the home studio that G. Kingsbow Esq. had set up in the basement, Manu realized he needed to take care of business, or the school year would get off to a disappointing start.  Manu was 14 years old and was preparing to start 9th grade. 



Just as he had finally gotten to the period of the first sentence of his written assignment, the illustrious Desire Lynette Kingsbow, known to Manu simply as ‘Mom’, knocked on the already open door to his bedroom. “Hi, Mah.” “Hi, Manu. What are you up to?” “Just getting started on that school assignment I told you about. What’s up?” “That’s good, dear. I wanted to let you know that we had volunteered you and Faith to take the Rancher kids out and show them around town.” “The Rancher kids?” “Yeah. They’re about your age. They moved into town recently, and we thought it would be nice for you guys to show them around.” “Okay,” Manu said, drawing out the word as though he were in real-time contemplation. “When is this supposed to happen?” “Can you be ready in 15  minutes?” “Mah! I  just got started on my assignment.” “Don’t worry, Manu. It’ll only be a couple of hours, and you can come back early and leave them in your sister’s hands.” “Okay. I’ll get ready.” 



Manu didn’t like being ripped away from the project he had only just gotten around to starting; something he considered to be a feat in and of itself. However, he couldn’t shake the excitement of meeting new people, especially when it became known that one of the ‘Rancher kids’ was a girl. Manu quickly gave himself a pat on the back for his stroke of genius in deciding to take a shower as the first thing he had done that morning, as he consulted his wardrobe. Now all he had to do was figure out what to wear on this momentous occasion. 



Manu couldn’t help but smile at the memory of his innocent, 14-year-old self. As he took the second step toward his father’s room, it registered that he couldn’t recall the commute to the meeting spot that happened to be his father’s old workplace, a prominent law firm where he had recently made partner. Mr Rancher was the chief accountant at the same firm, having moved to Harare a month before this outing. Arriving there, Manu led Faith to their father’s office, sat on the two chairs provided for guests, and waited. “Where do you think we should take them?” Faith asked - her first words since leaving the house about 30 minutes ago. Faith, Manu’s younger sister, was

\## Part II: The Collision

It happened on a rain-lashed Tuesday. Kaelen, frustrated with his driver’s cautious route through the Aethelgard traffic, ordered the car to stop. He decided to walk, taking a shortcut through a lesser-used bridge that connected to a commercial zone near the river. A sudden, torrential downpour caught him off guard, and he ducked into the nearest awning for shelter—the entrance of a small, forgotten public library on the very edge of the Warrens.

Inside, the air was warm and smelled of old paper and damp wool. And there, at a corner table bathed in the weak glow of a green-shaded lamp, was Elara. She was utterly absorbed, her brow furrowed in concentration, a pencil flying across a page. A stray drop of rain from Kaelen’s coat splattered onto her sketchbook.

She looked up, not with the deference he was accustomed to, but with a flash of irritation that quickly morphed into wary surprise. “You’re dripping on my duchy,” she said, her voice softer than he expected, but laced with a steel he didn’t anticipate.

He followed her gaze to the sketch. It wasn’t a building or a landscape, but a dress. A gown of impossible elegance, woven from lines that suggested both strength and ethereal grace, with patterns that echoed the intricate ironwork of the very bridge he’d just crossed. It was art. It was genius.

“I… apologize,” Kaelen said, uncharacteristically off-balance. “It’s… remarkable.”

Their conversation was stilted, a clumsy dance of two people from different planets. He was fascinated by her clarity of vision, so alien to the obfuscations of his world. She was intrigued by the intensity of his focus, even if his tailored coat probably cost more than her yearly rent. He bought her a cup of terrible library coffee as a peace offering. She told him the dress was inspired by the “veins of the city,” both the clean lines of the spires and the tangled, resilient chaos of the Warrens.

For Kaelen, it was a crack in the monochrome lens through which he viewed his life. For Elara, it was a fleeting glimpse of a man who saw her \*work\*, not her station.

## Part III: The Forbidden Garden

He found excuses to return to the library. He commissioned a piece from her—a redesign of his corporate logo, he claimed, needing an “outsider’s artistic perspective.” The fee he offered was astronomical; she refused it, accepting only a fair wage for a freelancer. Her pride both baffled and impressed him.

Their meetings became a secret garden in the shadow of two oppressive worlds. In the dusty library, power dynamics dissolved. Kaelen spoke of the soul-crushing weight of his inheritance, the loneliness of a life measured in quarterly reports. Elara spoke of the grinding anxiety of poverty, the fear that one missed shift could unravel the fragile safety net for Leo, but also of the fierce, creative fire that poverty could not extinguish.

He saw the raw talent in her sketches and, leveraging his power quietly, secured her a blind submission to the city’s most prestigious design institute. She was accepted on full merit. He began to question the cold architecture of his own destiny, the planned merger with Isadora feeling more like a corporate takeover of his heart.

Elara, meanwhile, was soaring on borrowed wings. The institute opened doors, but it also magnified the chasm between her and her peers. She was the “scholarship project,” her clothes simple, her stories rooted in a reality they could not comprehend. Her love for Kaelen was a terrifying secret, a jewel too bright to expose to the harsh light of either of their worlds.

Some examples I can think of where they possibly couldn't really accommodate was on season 1 of Master Chef where the girl Sheetal was a Hindu and believed every creature had a soul and was a vegetarian and was distraught over having to kill a crab. I figure since it's a cooking show you're going to run into situations where you're going to have to possibly kill an animal in some way shape or form. I figure since it was season 1 they may not have considered that.

  
The main reason that brought this issue up was because I was watching season 3 of Crime Scene Kitchen, and there was a couple that was Mormon, and apparently Mormons can't have coffee, there was coffee in the kitchen, they didn't realize it wasn't open but they used it anyway. I figured maybe the producers knew that they couldn't have coffee and it would put them at a disadvantage (due to not knowing how to make it and they had a struggle moment in doing so), since coffee isn't something that has to be in a food item.

  
For maybe reality TV shows if they have someone that doesn't celebrate a certain holiday (maybe christmas or something) would they skip a christmas episode and do something else instead?

  
Or is it a ""You signed up for this, deal with it"" situation? I hope i was able to explain/ask this in a good way, i'm really bad with words, i'm sorry. Thank you for reading my word salad.",1,1769806754.0,realitytv,0,1.0,False

Super noob here with the digital camera setup. Recently acquired my first Z50_2 and bought a 50-250mm standard lens through eBay. I've been clicking a few pictures to test my mettle. However my concern is with the amount of rattle I can hear when I gently shake the lens.

As a pole hobbyist, I'm really interested to hear stripper/SW opinions on this?

Samples: Chanel No 5 L'eau, Lancome La vie est Belle, Givenchy L'interdit, YSL Black Opium Glitter, V&R Flowerbomb and Valentino Donna Born in Rome og.

Of the bottles I don't think I will repurchase them. I liked Guess more as I love cherry and I could smell the cherry in this one, but it's an edt and maybe not long lasting enough for me. Lacoste is also an edt and I got noseblind to it quickly after applying. It smelled really nice for the brief moment I could notice it. I think I would have loved this in my teens. Cute, but not for me.

Of the samples I could see myself maybe buying the YSL and Valentino (10ml penspray/30ml fb) some day, but right now I have 15 full bottles and 8 samples more to go through. I could not smell the Chanel properly either. La vie est belle and Flowerbomb were too heavy and L'interdit was too spicy, not for me. Valentino felt like an easy everyday reach, very nice. Soft, sweet and a little woody. 1-2 sprays is enough. I liked the coffee note in YSL Glitter.   
  
I bought way too many (13) perfumes last year and this year I'm trying to not buy anymore and just use what I have. I think I should use up like 3 bottles before adding one to my collection. I like to have variety, but I've noticed that the amount that I have makes me a little anxious. Even the samples take time to get used up. They're 1,2ml-1,5ml so I got like 6 uses/days per sample.

- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*

I genuinely believe that. At some point things started to change. He began coming in not at 9:00 a.m. but around 9:20. He drinks coffee for half an hour smiles like everything in his life is perfect. At first we thought he’d fallen in love because he was literally glowing. But then we noticed that he doesn’t really care about bonuses, overtime, or even meetings anymore he’s calm everywhere, as if he just doesn’t care now. I got worried and invited him for a talk. Like, what’s going on are you burned out? Tired??? And he just said that he now has a side hustle and that everything’s fine, no need to worry. But it’s not fine for me at all. What do you mean a side hustle and why did it change him so much? Later someone accidentally found out that he’s been making really good money on 1win. I know a lot of people use it, but that’s when real panic started. I honestly got scared that he might leave soon because it feels like he’s no longer dependent on his salary. As if our department has now become *his* side job. I offered him a promotion, higher bonuses a flexible schedule. But he still feels distant. Not angry you can just see that the spark to hit targets and stress over bonuses is gone. Now I’m sitting here not knowing what to do. On one hand i’m happy that things are going well for him. On the other i’m afraid of losing a strong specialist. And trying to keep someone only with money is pointless that kind of motivation clearly doesn’t work for him anymore",0,1769806374.0,Ethiopia,4,0.17,False

Nicholas woke up the morning after the parade, but remained in a dream. The night on the beach with that girl, Brandy… It had been… something else. Something different. Special in a way he had never before experienced. His heart felt like it had been racing from the moment he saw her, and hadn’t slowed down for even a minute since.

Somehow, Nicholas managed to make breakfast for himself. He just couldn’t stop thinking about her. She was unlike anyone he had ever met. The way she spoke to him just… clicked. Sometimes having conversations could feel like a chore to Nicholas. Other people didn’t seem to pick up on what he meant, or the deeper meaning of what he said. Brandy did. She caught everything. No details went past her, and she spoke in a way that felt invigorating.

Conversations usually felt slow or labored to Nicholas. He knew what they were going to say before they said it, and they took their time getting to the point. He had to stop himself from finishing their sentences for them. Brandy wasn’t like that. She just… understood. Talking with her just felt… right.

She was also the most gorgeous girl he had ever seen. She had features that were simply… perfect. There was no other way to describe it. Her face was uniquely beautiful. She wasn’t just pretty or cute, she was… almost otherworldly. She had the visage of a goddess only… even more beautiful than that. It was almost impossible to describe her as she was unlike anyone he had ever seen. Features that blended strength with femininity in the way only divinity could manage.

Nicholas was startled out of his daydreaming by the sound of his phone buzzing. He practically leaped for it. Brandy had given him her number the night before, and he had been anxiously waiting for… anything, ever since.

His heart caught in his throat as he read the name on his lock screen.

***Brandy: Hey, you busy?***

Nicholas replied immediately.

***Nicholas: Nope I just got up***

Nicholas held his breath as he waited for a reply.

***Brandy: Want to join us for coffee?***

Nicholas could’ve shouted for joy when he read the message. He responded as fast as he could.

***Nicholas: Sure!***

He could’ve shed tears of joy at that moment. He would get to see her again! Brandy sent over the name of the coffee shop they were heading to and Nicholas practically sprinted to his car.

‘I get to see her again!’ He thought to himself.

The coffee shop wasn’t far from Nicholas’ house, but he still made it there in record time. It was a quaint place. Old and worn, but in a cozy way. Brandy and Anna were already there when Nicholas got there.

Immediately nervousness took Nicholas again. God she was so pretty. Dear God. She smiled at him and he almost passed out.

“Good to see you again!” He managed to say.

“You too stranger,” Brandy replied with a slight smile.

Anna’s eyes flicked back and forth between the two, but she said nothing. The girls already had their coffee so they grabbed a place to sit while Nicholas ordered. He found them on a comfortable looking couch in the corner. He noticed that the spot next to Brandy was open. He wavered for a moment before sitting in the chair across from the couch. Dammit. Why did he do that? He could barely look at her. He set his drink down on the low coffee table that separated them.

Nicholas managed a glance at Brandy. If she had cared about him sitting next to her, she didn’t show it. She just kept on smiling at him… that gorgeous… intoxicating smile. Nicholas put his hands in his lap to stop them from shaking. It helped a little bit.

“So,” Anna began. “We’re going to the beach today. Want to go with us?”

Shit. Fuck. Dammit.

Damn. Nicholas wanted to go. He wanted so badly to join them, but he had already promised to spend the afternoon with his father.

“I would love to but…” He sighed. “I have plans. I’m going to see my friend.”

This did get a response out of Brandy. Her expression changed from her sly smile to a slight frown. God dammit. Nicholas began to panic.

“But I can spend a little bit of time hanging out this morning!” He said quickly. “I don’t need to leave for a few hours.”

This caused Brandy to perk up again. “So you’ll come to the beach with us?” She asked.

“Yeah, “ Nicholas began. “Actually…” He trailed off.

“Yes?” Brandy prompted. She was smiling again.

“There’s actually a secret beach near here. Walking distance. Want to go?”

“Yeah absolutely!” Brandy’s enthusiasm was obvious now.

“Alright, as soon as we’re done we can head off,” Nicholas smiled.

Anna glanced back and forth between them again with a contemplative expression. Nicholas’ panicked slightly. She knew how he felt. It must’ve been obvious. Oh God, did Brandy know too? His stomach twisted into a knot.

Nicholas managed to keep his hands from shaking too badly as they finished their drinks and set off. He guided them down the street towards the entrance to the beach. It was through a dense patch of woods. These were thick, Florida woods. Without the slightly worn path it would have been almost impassible.

“You’re not dragging us to the wilderness to kill us right?” Brandy asked.

Nicholas panicked again before noticing the grin on her face. She was joking. Christ. He really needed to get a handle on himself. She was funny. She made jokes. He liked jokes. He could be funny too. He tried to steady his breathing. She was so close… walking just next to him. Their hands almost brushed each other. His breath caught.

They emerged into a small stretch of beach, completely clear of people. There were two rickety wooden chairs that had been thrown together on the sand. Only a few people knew about this spot. Nicholas smiled and turned around to face the girls.

“Ta-da!” He said, throwing his arms wide. “A private beach just for you.”

Anna gaped at it, but Brandy just smiled looking at the water. Then she turned that smile on Nicholas. That radiant smile. His heart did a flip.

“It’s beautiful,” She said, her eyes twinkling.

He smiled back. He had to. He couldn’t help himself. She just… made something inside of him leap for joy. Despite all his nervousness, he was happy. Happy just to be around her. Happy to look into her eyes and see the stars behind them. He was still terrified, but at the same time he felt safe when he looked into those brilliant blue eyes. He trusted her. Completely.

It took effort to tear his eyes away from hers. Her gaze was intoxicating. He wanted nothing more than to keep looking at her, but he forced himself to act casually. He wasn’t very convincing.

They began to set up their things on the beach. The girls laid out towels and Nicholas stretched out on one of the chairs, feeling the sun on his face. He smiled and glanced at the girls and had to keep himself from yelping. Brandy had taken off her shorts and shirt to reveal a bikini underneath. He knew she had been wearing one, but seeing it on her was… something else. He struggled not to stare at her as she laid on the towel. God she was perfect. Every inch of her was… sculpted. Artistic. Deliberately designed. The ideal human form. A goddess.

Nicholas kept stealing glances at her. It was hard not to. Seeing her laid out next to him made his heart thunder in his chest, and made his stomach do flips. He had to say something. He HAD to talk to her. He couldn’t let this girl, this wonderful, gorgeous, perfect girl, leave his life without at least TRYING to talk to her.

Nicholas sat for several minutes trying to think of something, anything, to say, but his mind was completely blank. All he could think about was her stunning form and perfect curves. Her smile and her eyes. The sound of her laugh. The way she walked, spoke, joked, and smirked all swirled around in his mind and overwhelmed his ability to think about anything else. She had him completely enraptured.

Before he could work up the courage to say something, Brandy sat up and looked out across the water.

“Is it cold?” She asked him, still looking out to the horizon.

It took a moment for Nicholas to find his voice. “Probably a little chilly,” he said. It’s still only February. Even if it is Florida.

“Ah well,” Brandy replied. “I’ll survive.”

With that she hopped up and strode purposefully towards the water. She didn’t even hesitate before charging into the oncoming waves. She yelped slightly as the water hit her, but smiled the whole time.

“Yeah!” She yelled back at the shore. “It’s cold!”

Nicholas couldn’t help but grin at that. God she was cute. Beyond cute.

He watched her for a while as she splashed in the waves. Eventually Anna joined her, giving a little shout of her own as she felt the cold water against her skin. He was glad they were out there. It gave him an excuse to watch Brandy as she swam. The whole world melted away and she was all he could focus on.

After a few minutes Brandy made her way out of the water, shivering.

“So…” she asked, a mischievous smile on her lips. “What time are you meeting your friend?”

“Oh,” Nicholas had almost forgotten that he couldn’t stay the whole day. “I’ll have to leave in about an hour I think.”

“Oh good,” Brandy replied. “That’ll give you more than enough time to dry off!”

Without warning, Brandy suddenly wrapped her arms around him, and pressed her wet body against him. Nicholas panicked and pushed her away. He immediately regretted it. She had hugged him… and he had pushed her away. He was such an idiot.

She was still smiling however, and he looked down at his sodden shirt.

“Ah,” Nicholas said. “Fair enough.” He gave her a smile that came from somewhere deep inside him. It was the only way he could express his feelings at that moment. Standing next to her, he felt nothing but joy. Even if he wished he hadn’t pushed her off quite so quickly.

Nicholas looked down at his shirt again and sighed. He pulled it off and draped it over the back of one of the chairs. He noticed Brandy looking at him as he did so. She had an expression that he couldn’t quite place.

He glanced down at himself. He never felt that he was all that much to look at. He was pale, (he never had been able to tan effectively) and although he exercised regularly, he was always more lean than muscular. He was slim and fairly well defined, but not exactly the epitome of the “strong manly gym bro” archetype that women seemed to prefer.

Brandy continued to look at him and Nicholas blushed. God. She was undoubtedly revising her opinion of him. He wasn’t exactly impressive looking with his shirt off. He tried to stay calm and pretended he didn’t notice her looking. He moved to his chair and sat down again, closing his eyes against the bright sun.

For the next hour Nicholas tried his very best to relax. He was unsuccessful. He wanted so badly to stare at Brandy, but he limited himself to quick glances every now and then. He didn’t want to creep her out. No matter how good she looked, and she looked damn good, he didn’t want her to think that he was a creep.

Eventually Nicholas checked the time and felt his heart sink. He needed to leave. At this point he would be late, but he didn’t want to push it. He stood up and stretched.

“Alright,” he said, attempting to keep the reluctance out of his voice. “Time for me to head off.”

“Have fun!” Anna said.

“Enjoy yourself mister!” Brandy called to him.

Nicholas felt a small pain in his stomach at her tone. She didn’t seem at all upset at the notion of him leaving. Oh well. He needed to face reality anyways. She was out of his league. WAY out of his league. He had no chance with her, and the sooner he accepted that the easier things would be.

He pulled his shirt back on and waved goodbye to the girls before setting off down the wooded path that would take him back to civilization. As he reached the main road and set off towards his car he felt his phone vibrate. He almost dropped it as he ripped it out of his pocket to check the message.

It was from Brandy.

***Brandy: boy you got me fucked up***

Nicholas blinked and reread the message. What? What did that mean?

***Nicholas: What?***

Nicholas waited for a response barely daring to breathe

***Brandy: I like you.***

Nicholas almost blacked out as he read the message. When his head stopped spinning he reread it. No way. No fucking way. There is no fucking way that Brandy just sent him that. He must be imagining it. There is no way that Brandy, the most gorgeous girl he had ever seen, liked him back. He steadied himself and responded.

***Nicholas: That’s quite the coincidence because I happen to like you too.***

After sending it Nicholas managed to force himself to start walking again. His legs were unsteady as he made his way back to the coffee shop. He checked his phone again.

***Brandy: So what should we do about this?***

Oh dear god. Nicholas’ mind raced. What the hell SHOULD they do? He was terrified of coming on too strong, of scaring her away.

***Nicholas: Well… I’d personally like to get to know you better***

Each second after sending a message felt like hours. He couldn’t stop staring at his phone, waiting for Brandy to respond.

***Brandy: I’d like that too :)***

Nicholas was flooded with the most intense and confusing mix of emotions he had ever felt. He was exhilarated, jubilant, and terrified all at once. He couldn’t stop his hands from shaking.

***Nicholas: Well… when are you going to be in town again? Maybe we could hang out. Just the two of us.***

This was it.

***Brandy: I’ll be back next weekend. I’d enjoy that***

Nicholas could’ve shouted for joy right there in the street, but he was fairly certain that Brandy would still be able to hear him even at this distance.

***Nicholas: Wonderful :) Want to make a plan?***

***Brandy: Later. You need to meet with your friend and I’m going to take a nap. Text me when you’re free okay? :)***

***Nicholas: Absolutely***

Practically sprinting, Nicholas raced to his car, his heart exploding with excitement. He was smiling like an idiot the entire drive to the park where he was meeting his friend Katie.

Nicholas was walking on air as he made his way to the meeting place. Katie was already there. Nicholas was a few minutes late, but nothing outrageous. He beamed when he saw her.

She raised an eyebrow at him. “What’s got you so happy today?”

Katie was… well… she was Katie. She was Nicholas’ friend. She had been forever. She was a few inches shorter than him and was of slim build. She had blonde hair that came down to her shoulders and angular features. Sometimes guys at school would say that she was hot, but to Nicholas she was… well… she was Katie. That’s all he was able to see her as. Katie.

“I uh,” Nicholas began, suddenly self conscious. “Well… I have a date.”

This caused both of Katie’s eyebrows to shoot up. Then she smiled.

“Oh really…? And who exactly is the lucky lady?” Katie’s curiosity was visible on her face.

“She’s uh… Well… She’s a friend of Anna’s. From her school.”

“Ohhhh? So you’re going on a date with a brainiac then?” Katie teased.

“Yeah. I guess I am.” Nicholas finally began to smile again.

“Well c’mon then! Tell me!” Katie elbowed him. “Let’s walk and talk.”

They set off heading away from the park and towards Westshell’s downtown. Nicholas relayed everything, from the parade, to the beach the night before, to what had happened just that morning. Katie watched him as he spoke, a hint of a smile on her face.

“You know,” she said as Nicholas finished the story. “I’ve never seen you this excited about a girl before. She must really be special.”

“She is. She really really is.” Nicholas replied. “I’m just… worried.”

“Worried?” Katie frowned. “Why are you worried?”

Nicholas sighed. “I’m worried about the distance for one thing. She lives an hour away.”

Katie snorted. “An hour? An hour is nothing. If you really like this girl, and I can tell you do, then that hour won’t mean shit.”

“Yeah you’re right,”  Nicholas said.

“What’s the other thing then?” Katie asked.

“Well…” Nicholas wasn’t sure how to put his feelings into words. “She’s just… so amazing that… I’m terrified that I’m not… good enough for her. I’m worried she’ll get bored of me, or disappointed in me, or I’ll let her down in some way, and then she’ll leave and…” he let the thought trail off. They weren’t even together, and the thought of Brandy leaving him was crushing. Suffocating. A vice grip on his chest.

Katie stopped walking and looked into his eyes. “Look. She reached out to you. Obviously she’s interested in you. You need to trust her when she tells you things and take her at her word. Trust her. That’s part of being in a relationship. You’re giving the other person the power to hurt you and trusting that they won’t. If she really likes you, then you will be enough. If she cares for you and respects you, then she won’t hurt you. If half of what you say about her is true, then she’s worth taking the leap for. But you need to trust her fully. Otherwise, it won’t work.”

Nicholas nodded. He could do that. He wanted to do that. Brandy was worth it, he knew it. He knew she was. And he did trust her. He trusted her deeply despite only knowing her for a short time. She just… felt… different from every other person he had ever met. If he couldn’t trust her… who could he trust? What was the point in dating anybody?

“Alright,” Nicholas said, steeling himself. “I’m gonna go for it.”

“Good,” Katie smiled again. “I can’t wait to meet her.”",1,1769806353.0,u_MachuPixu,0,1.0,False
1qrhnwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alternative_Low_1007/comments/1qrhnwg/storytime_love_or_wealth/,StoryTime: Love or Wealth,"The garden party sparkled with a kind of moneyed perfection that made the champagne bubbles seem choreographed. Elara stood between two worlds, the silk of her dress whispering secrets against her skin.



To her left was Leo. His smile was a calculated curve, his suit worth more than her car. He spoke of mergers, of vineyards in Tuscany, of a penthouse with a view that could make you forget the ground existed. When his hand brushed hers, it was cool and smooth, a promise of a life where every problem had a financial solution. He offered stability, a gilded cage where she’d never have to worry again. With Leo, she saw herself presiding over charity galas, her laughter echoing in marble halls, safe and splendidly numb.



To her right was Adrian. His jacket was slightly frayed at the cuffs, his eyes the warm, chaotic grey of a stormy sea. He spoke of the novel he was writing, of the way the light hit the old city walls at dawn, of taking the train south just to see where it ended. When he laughed, it was a full-bodied sound that made her ribs ache with an unfamiliar joy. He offered a life of shared coffee mugs, cramped bookshops, and passionate debates that lasted until sunrise. With Adrian, she saw a small apartment filled with plants and unfinished canvases, a life of feeling everything, intensely and messily.



For weeks, Elara danced on a tightrope. Dates with Leo were exquisite affairs—five-course meals where the silverware intimidated her. He gave her a necklace, a delicate diamond teardrop that felt heavy on her collarbone. It was beautiful, but it felt like a receipt.



Dates with Adrian were adventures. They got caught in the rain, shared a single slice of pie, and he read her paragraphs of his book, his voice weaving worlds just for her. He gave her a seashell from a beach they’d walked, its interior gleaming like a captured sunrise. It was worthless, and it felt priceless.



The crisis came on a Tuesday. Leo presented her with a key—not to a house, but to a luxury car, a sleek silver thing that symbolized a clear, paved road forward. That same evening, Adrian showed up at her door, breathless, with two train tickets to a coastal town he’d just heard had a festival of lights. “It’ll probably be a disaster,” he grinned, “but it’ll be our disaster.”



That night, Elara didn’t sleep. She laid the diamond necklace and the seashell side by side on her dresser. One reflected the sterile light of her lamp; the other seemed to hold a light of its own. She realized she wasn’t choosing between two men. She was choosing between two versions of herself.



The woman who chose Leo would be adored, provided for, and eternally comfortable. She would have everything, and yet, in the quiet moments, she might always wonder about the sound of the sea in that shell.



The woman who chose Adrian would face uncertainty, financial struggles, and the terrifying vulnerability of a love with no safety net. But she would have mornings filled with real, uncurated laughter and a heart that felt truly full.



As dawn broke, painting the sky in hues of rose and gold, Elara made her choice. It wasn’t about rejecting money or embracing poverty. It was about acknowledging that the richest life wasn’t the one with the most possessions, but the one with the most \*life\* in it.



She left the diamond necklace in its velvet box on Leo’s polished desk with a note that simply read, “Thank you for the dream.” Then, with the seashell tucked safely in her pocket, she walked to the train station, her heart pounding a frantic, hopeful rhythm against her ribs.



Adrian was already there, looking anxiously at the departures board. When he saw her, his whole face transformed with a relief and joy so raw it stole her breath. He didn’t ask about her choice. He simply took her hand, his own warm and slightly calloused, and said, “Ready for our disaster?”



As the train pulled away from the city of certainty, Elara knew the road ahead would be bumpy, unpredictable, and far from perfect. But for the first time, looking at their intertwined hands and the wild, open landscape rushing by, she felt perfectly, incandescently rich.

For years, I cycled through different apps, fancy journals, and bullet spreads, only to abandon them after a few days or weeks. *I’d start with so much enthusiasm, then the shame would creep in when I saw all those empty boxes.* I probably ""failed"" at consistent habit tracking at least four times, each time feeling like I lacked willpower or was just fundamentally unorganized.

My turning point wasn't a sudden burst of discipline, but a quiet frustration after my *fourth* failed attempt. I realized that my problem wasn't the *tracking tool* itself (I'd tried simple checklists, sophisticated apps like Streaks, even a physical whiteboard). The common myth I believed was that *the right app would fix everything*. What finally clicked for me was that I was trying to fit my life into a generic system, instead of building a system that fit *my* chaotic, imperfect life. *My ""aha!"" moment was realizing I needed to simplify, connect, and celebrate the smallest steps.*

So, I stopped looking for the perfect app and started building a system based on three core principles: **Minimalism, Integration, and Forgiveness.** This isn't groundbreaking, but it's what *finally* stuck for me.

Here’s the step-by-step framework I built:

1.  **Start *Painfully* Small (The 1% Rule):** This is where most people, including past me, go wrong. Instead of tracking ""workout for 30 min,"" I started with ""put on workout clothes."" For reading, it was ""open the book."" *The goal was to make it so easy, I couldn't say no.* I only added to the habit once I had a 90% streak on the ""micro-habit"" for two weeks.
2.  **Anchor Habits (Don't Create, Connect):** I stopped trying to *add* new things to my day and started *connecting* them. My habit tracker isn't a standalone to-do list; it's a reflection of my existing routine.
    *   *After I brush my teeth* (existing habit), I meditate for 5 minutes (new micro-habit).
    *   *While coffee brews* (existing habit), I open my reading app for 5 pages.
    *   *Before dinner* (existing habit), I fill my water bottle.
    This creates an immediate trigger.
3.  **Choose *One* Core Tracking Method & Stick to It:** I tried complex apps that offered too many features and ended up overwhelmed. I went back to basics: a simple digital checklist (I use Notion, but Google Sheets or even a sticky note works) with only *the most critical 3-5 habits*. No fancy graphs needed initially. Just a ✅ or ❌. *The less friction to track, the more likely you are to actually track.*
4.  **The 2-Day Rule (Forgiveness, Not Perfection):** This was a game-changer. James Clear talks about it in *Atomic Habits*. If I miss a day, I *never* miss two days in a row. *It shifted my mindset from ""I ruined my streak"" to ""Okay, minor blip, let's get back on track immediately.""* This principle is about consistency over perfection.
5.  **Micro-Reviews & Micro-Rewards:** Every Sunday, I spend 10 minutes looking at my tracker. Not to beat myself up, but to see patterns. ""Why did I miss Tuesday? Oh, I stayed up too late."" I also consciously link small rewards to streaks (e.g., hitting 90% for a month means I buy that book I wanted, or treat myself to a nice coffee). This isn't about grand gestures, but about acknowledging effort.

Let's be real, this isn't a magic bullet. I still have days, even weeks, where my consistency dips. *The part nobody talks about is that life gets in the way.* I almost gave up when I had a particularly stressful work month and my meditation streak plummeted from 95% to 50%. The mistake I made was trying to force it back to 95% immediately. Instead, I had to remind myself of the *painfully small* step and just ""sit on the cushion"" for 1 minute.

This approach might *not* work for you if you're trying to overhaul your entire life in a week or if you thrive on complex, highly detailed tracking systems. It's built for those who get easily overwhelmed and need simplicity. Expect it to take **at least 2-3 months** for this system to feel like a natural part of your day, not a chore.

After implementing this system for **6 months**, I'm hitting **95% consistency** across my core habits: daily meditation, reading 20 pages, hitting my water goal, and writing for 30 minutes. It's not just about the numbers, though. My life has genuinely improved: I feel more centered and less reactive, I'm actually making progress on personal projects, and the constant guilt of 'not doing enough' has significantly decreased. *I finally trust myself to build and maintain habits.*

If you're on a similar journey – tired of the habit-tracking roller coaster and ready for a system that actually sticks – r/Empowish is where we share real progress, celebrate every win (especially the messy ones), and support each other through the struggle.

1qrhi2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1qrhi2w/finally_built_a_morning_routine_that_actually/,"Finally built a morning routine that *actually* sticks: It wasn't about waking up earlier, but about pre-planning my first 5 minutes (Lost 2 hours of scrolling daily) ⚡","My mornings used to be a black hole of 'just five more minutes' followed by a guilt-ridden two hours of phone scrolling – a relentless cycle of checking social media, news, and emails before my brain had even fully registered daylight. I’d crawl out of bed feeling defeated before the day even began, constantly behind, constantly playing catch-up. I tried everything: 5 AM alarms, cold showers, elaborate habit trackers, and they all failed because *I still ended up with my phone in my hand, lost in the scroll vortex.*

I was so frustrated, thinking I just lacked willpower, that I *couldn't* be a morning person. The real ""aha moment"" hit me after yet another failed attempt to wake up at 6 AM. It wasn't about the *time* I woke up, but *what* I did with those first few crucial minutes *after* waking. I realized my phone was my immediate comfort, my default escape. The problem wasn't my alarm; it was my instant access to distraction. *My morning was being hijacked by the very first thing I did.* My focus shifted from ""how can I wake up earlier?"" to ""how can I make those initial 5 minutes non-negotiable for my well-being?""

**The Method/Framework: Reclaiming Your First 5 Minutes**

Here's the simple, low-friction framework that finally worked for me to break the scrolling habit:

1.  **The Night-Before Pre-Emption:** This is critical. Before you go to bed, *physically move your phone* out of arm's reach from your bed. I charge mine across the room or even in a different room entirely. The goal is to make it inconvenient to grab immediately.
2.  **Design Your ""First 5"" Activity:** What can you realistically do for 5 minutes that requires *no* screen and zero decision-making? Make it something low-effort but high-return for your mental state. My go-to options:
    *   **Hydrate:** A tall glass of water waiting on my nightstand.
    *   **Stretch:** 5 minutes of gentle stretches. I put a small yoga mat right next to my bed.
    *   **Journal (briefly):** Just two sentences of gratitude or a quick brain dump. Keep a small notebook and pen ready.
    *   **Deep Breathing:** 5 minutes of mindful breathing.
    *   *The key is to pick ONE and have everything you need for it prepared the night before.*
3.  **The ""Loop Breaker"" Action:** As soon as your alarm goes off (which should be across the room, forcing you to get up), immediately engage in your planned ""First 5"" activity. Do *not* sit back down. Do *not* pick up your phone. My personal rule: *The phone doesn't get touched until I've completed my First 5, made my bed, and had my first cup of water/coffee.* This breaks the subconscious habit loop that leads straight to scrolling.
4.  **Anchor it to an Existing Habit:** Once you've completed your First 5, immediately transition to another small, positive habit. For me, it was making my bed. It's a small win that builds momentum and signals the start of the day.

**Real Talk & Obstacles:**
Let's be real, this isn't a magic bullet. I totally messed up in the beginning. There were mornings when I was exhausted, my alarm went off, and I just grabbed my phone anyway and started scrolling from the floor. *I almost gave up when I felt that familiar wave of guilt creep back in.* The key was to **forgive myself and reset the next morning.** This won't work if you're expecting instant perfection or if your job genuinely requires you to be glued to your phone from the second you wake up (though even then, a 5-minute buffer might be possible). It took me about **2-3 weeks** to really feel this solidify, and even now, I have off days. Common mistake: trying to cram too much into those first 5 minutes. Keep it simple, keep it easy.

**Results & Proof:**
After about **45 days** of consistently implementing this, the change has been incredible. I no longer lose those two precious hours to mindless scrolling. Instead, I've consistently dedicated that time to:
*   Reading a physical book (currently ""Atomic Habits,"" fittingly!)
*   Working on a side project (my online course draft)
*   Planning my top 3 tasks for the day with clarity
*   Taking a mindful walk before work
I feel less rushed, more intentional, and surprisingly, more energized throughout the day. *That initial sense of defeat has been replaced by a quiet sense of accomplishment.* It's not about being 'productive' 24/7; it's about reclaiming agency over my own mornings.

Maybe it was telling you about the internship, or asking if you wanted to get coffee, or maybe it’s something else entirely. Whatever it is, I’m genuinely sorry if I made you uncomfortable or crossed a line.

I know you said you’re busy, and I understand that. But I’ll be honest it’s hard for me to just accept a single short message and feel okay with it. It starts to feel less like a friendship and more like I’m just an obligation you’re checking off, and that feeling is difficult for me.

Being treated like an obligation is something that hits close to home. It reminds me of how I felt growing up like I was something to manage instead of someone to connect with. When I start to feel that way, it brings up a lot, and I tend to hide behind humor and act like a cartoon version of myself so I don’t feel too exposed.

I really do enjoy talking with you and being around your energy. But if our conversations keep feeling one sided or forced, it’s going to be hard for me to continue, because it starts to hurt more than it helps.

1qrhf0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1qrhf0l/tall_rant/,Tall rant,"Not allowing partners to choose their days off is utilitarian. 

It’s demanding that we align our lives with the schedule that suits the stores (oh I meant, “coffee houses’) needs. Instead of the opposite. 

Creating the availability window to be 1,000% open to adhere to the “coffee houses’” needs is bs. 

I’ve been gaslit to the point of frustration about my availability.

My life does not revolve around Starbucks just because I have nothing else going on. I have a life to live. I don’t want to be the partner that passes away & gets replaced… 

We’re unfairly treated like robots & the availability proves that. The SM copy & pastes the schedule every week to the point where if one schedule doesn’t work for him he won’t change it. 

I work in a busy drive thru /pick up store with mandatory weekends and I’m available every single day. It’s BS. But of course Sundays are highly requested. There are certain partners who don’t work the weekends or they’re just scheduled for one day in the weekend because their availability is honored. There’s supposed to be fair rollover for the scheduling so we can all take turns getting a day on the weekends off…

It’s ridiculous to create a new availability and not be able to accommodate your own life and your needs.

But to create a new availability now you have to add 50+ hrs (which we don’t even work!) and if you leave one day off it doesn’t fit the needs of the store. Just leaving it blank. Not acceptable. Acknowledging that if I needed to be called in I’d go in doesn’t suffice either. 

It’s one day. I get treated like a little kid about it—why do you think you’re the only one that deserves that one day off?—I’d have to give everyone that day off—(people callout whenever they want to).

I’ve been pushed to opening & told I’d be taking away hours from my coworkers if I move to mid. 

It’s gaslighting. It doesn’t work for me anymore. 

I’m a 4 & a half year partner ready to hang my apron forever at this point. The benefits have kept my sanity, but being treated like I have no choice when I get to have a break is pushing it.

This is a food service job at the end of the day it will not matter.

I'd scroll through endless 'how-to' articles and motivational videos, feeling the weight of that unfinished novel/app/business plan pressing down on me. If you've ever felt that soul-crushing gap between *wanting* to start and actually *starting*, you're definitely not alone. I was the queen of elaborate planning that never led to action, always waiting for that perfect burst of energy or a huge block of uninterrupted time that, surprise, never appeared.

I tried the ""just power through an hour"" method, the ""visualize success"" method, even the ""bribe yourself with chocolate"" method. All of them failed because the sheer mental resistance to *just sit down and begin* was overwhelming. *My ""aha!"" moment came from realizing the problem wasn't my willpower, it was the size of the initial commitment.* I was burning more mental energy dreading the task than it would take to actually do a tiny piece of it. What if the goal wasn't to *make progress* every day, but simply to *start*?

Here's the ridiculously simple method that finally got me moving, 30 days and counting:

### **The 5-Minute Momentum Starter** 💪

This isn't about productivity in the traditional sense; it's about breaking the starting barrier and building *proof* to your brain that you can, in fact, begin.

1.  **Identify Your *Absolute Smallest* First Step.** This is crucial. For my novel, it wasn't ""write a paragraph."" It was ""open the Word document."" For someone learning to code, it might be ""open the IDE."" For a fitness goal, ""put on running shoes."" Make it so small it feels almost silly to *not* do it. *The part nobody talks about is the sheer mental resistance to even opening the file.*
2.  **Schedule It for 5 Minutes, *Same Time Every Day*.** Consistency trumps intensity, especially at the start. Pick a time that's easy to commit to (e.g., right after coffee, before dinner, first thing in the morning) and stick to it. Use a timer.
3.  **Eliminate All Distractions for Those 5 Minutes.** Put your phone away, close irrelevant browser tabs, tell your family you need 5 minutes of focused time. Treat these 5 minutes like sacred deep work.
4.  **Do *Only* That One Tiny Step.** Seriously, that's it. If your step is ""open the document,"" you open it. You don't have to write. If inspiration strikes and you want to do more, fine, but the *requirement* is just the tiny step. *The goal isn't progress, it's starting.*
5.  **Stop When the Timer Goes Off.** This might feel counter-intuitive, especially if you're ""in the zone."" But stopping leaves you with a feeling of wanting to do more, creating positive anticipation for tomorrow. It prevents burnout and associates the task with an easy, positive experience.

### **Real Talk & Obstacles**

This isn't magic, and it's definitely not an overnight fix. I almost gave up when I felt like 5 minutes was laughably small for my huge project. *It's easy to dismiss because it feels too simple.* I missed a day or two, and the immediate thought was, ""Well, I blew it."" But the beauty is, the commitment is so small, it's easy to just pick it up the next day without feeling like you failed completely.

**Who this might NOT work for:** If your biggest obstacle is *not knowing what your first tiny step is*, you need to spend some time brainstorming and breaking down your project first. This also won't work if you consistently try to do more than 5 minutes for the first week or two; you'll burn out the initial motivation.

You'll see subtle shifts in your mental game within a week, but the real momentum builds around 3-4 weeks. Your brain starts to associate the activity with ""easy wins"" instead of ""dreaded effort.""

### **Results & Proof (30 Days In!)**

After just 30 days of committing to my 5-minute daily ""open the document"" habit, I've now written over 15,000 words of my novel. That's more than I've written in the last five years combined! But the biggest win isn't just the progress on the book; it's the feeling of internal power I've reclaimed. The mental block has crumbled. I no longer feel the constant guilt or the paralysis of overwhelm. I feel capable, consistent, and genuinely excited to see what I can build, 5 minutes at a time.

When I do this I try to pick two stores close together and then tip around $18.   

Normally the driver leaves both at the front door at the same time.  Today for some reason they dropped off the Dunkin first and then left.   I thought there was some glitch in the system and the second order was missed.

So, I contacted GH for a refund for that item.   Turns out that the driver doubled back with it while I was on the chat with GH.    GH told me to go check again because there was an image of it left at the door.  I go down and voila there it is.

Meanwhile GH apologizes for the mix up and says it's refunding the entire order.  ALL of it.   

I kept asking it not to because I think the driver just got confused or maybe even was trying to be nice by dropping the coffee off first so it wouldn't get cold.  GH chat wouldn't tell me if the driver gets to keep the tip.

Please tell me the driver still gets to keep the tip and gets paid even if the order gets refunded?   It's snowing here and there are piles of snow everywhere.  Now I feel like a complete jerk.

I had one app for my smart lighting, another for the sprinkler system, and then multiple separate apps for different bird feeders. I’d be sitting on the porch with my coffee, trying to relax, but I was actually just jumping between five different interfaces to check battery levels, adjust lighting schedules, or see which feeder was getting the most action. It was the opposite of peaceful.  
  
Last weekend, I wanted to consolidate. I swapped some gear around so I could manage the essentials from just one or two spots. I moved my outdoor lighting and irrigation into a single hub, and I finally moved my birding setup over to coolfly.  
  
Having the feeder highlights, the bird identification, and the global community feed all in one spot, instead of jumping between a feeder app and a browser to look things up, made a massive difference. It sounds like a small change, but it shifted the experience from managing gadgets back to enjoying a hobby. It’s much easier to stay in the moment when you aren't digging through folders on your phone.  
  
I’ve even started leaving my phone inside more often now that I’m not constantly checking for notifications across half a dozen different apps. It’s funny how simplifying the tech actually helped me disconnect from the screen and focus on the actual backyard.

Here's What Las Vegas Executives Are Figuring Out.,"You're doing the things you're supposed to do. You hit the gym when you can. You've cleaned up your diet—at least compared to ten years ago. You cut back on drinking. You try to sleep more. You downloaded the meditation app.

And yet.

You still drag yourself out of bed. Coffee is non-negotiable just to function. By 3 PM your brain feels like it's pushing through mud. You recover slower from travel than you used to. Your focus isn't what it was five years ago. You're tired in a way that weekends don't fix.

Your last physical said everything was ""normal."" So why do you feel like you're operating at 60 percent?

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. And you're not imagining it. There's a reason conventional healthcare keeps telling you you're fine while you feel anything but—and a growing number of Las Vegas executives have figured out what that reason is.

**""Normal"" Is a Lie**

Here's what most people don't understand about standard bloodwork: it's designed to detect disease, not optimize performance.

When your doctor says your results are ""normal,"" they mean your numbers fall within a reference range based on the general population. That range is wide. It includes people who feel terrible. It includes people twenty years older than you. It includes people whose bodies are technically functioning but nowhere near optimally.

Your testosterone might be ""normal"" while sitting at a level that leaves you fatigued and foggy. Your thyroid could be ""within range"" while still underperforming for what your body needs. Your inflammatory markers might not trigger any flags while quietly draining your energy and accelerating your aging.

Conventional medicine isn't looking for optimization. It's looking for pathology. If you don't have a diagnosable disease, you don't have a problem—at least not one the system is equipped to address.

This is why you can do everything ""right"" and still feel wrong. The tools being used to evaluate your health aren't calibrated for performance. They're calibrated for disease detection. That gap is where your missing energy, focus, and vitality disappeared to.

**What's Actually Happening in Your Body**

Las Vegas executives face a particular combination of demands that accelerate biological decline faster than they realize.

Chronic stress keeps cortisol elevated, which disrupts sleep, impairs recovery, promotes fat storage, and degrades cognitive function over time. The body adapts to high cortisol by downregulating systems it considers non-essential under threat conditions—including hormone production, cellular repair, and immune optimization.

The city's pace prevents the recovery that biological systems require. Your body doesn't rebuild during activity. It rebuilds during rest. When rest is perpetually compromised—late nights, early flights, constant demands—repair falls behind damage. The deficit accumulates invisibly until it manifests as persistent fatigue, slower thinking, and diminished capacity.

Hormonal decline compounds everything. Testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormones, growth hormone—all of these naturally decrease with age, but stress and poor recovery accelerate the drop. By the time most executives notice something's wrong, they've been operating with suboptimal hormones for years.

Mitochondrial function degrades under chronic stress. These cellular structures produce the energy your body runs on. When they're not working efficiently, every system suffers. No amount of caffeine compensates for cells that can't generate adequate fuel.

Inflammation builds silently. Chronic low-grade inflammation—triggered by stress, poor sleep, and metabolic dysfunction—creates a constant energy drain while accelerating aging at the cellular level.

None of this shows up on standard bloodwork until it's progressed significantly. By the time conventional medicine catches it, you've lost years of optimal function.

**The Model That Actually Works**

A different approach exists. It's called concierge longevity medicine, and it's built around the premise that conventional medicine ignores: optimization matters as much as disease prevention.

The structural differences are significant. Instead of being one of 2,500 patients competing for your doctor's attention, you're one of fewer than 150. Instead of 15-minute appointments that barely cover the basics, you get comprehensive consultations. Instead of waiting weeks for access, you have direct communication with your physician.

But the diagnostic difference is where the real value lies.

Concierge longevity practices test what standard care ignores: full hormone panels including free and total testosterone, estrogen metabolites, thyroid cascade, DHEA, cortisol patterns, and growth hormone markers. Advanced testing like the DUTCH panel shows how your body metabolizes and clears hormones—not just what's present in your blood at a single moment. Inflammatory markers reveal hidden systemic stress. Mitochondrial and NAD+ testing evaluates cellular energy production directly. Genetic panels identify predispositions affecting everything from detoxification to stress response.

From this data, treatment becomes precise. Hormone optimization restores levels to where cognition and energy peak—not just where disease is absent. NAD+ IV therapy replenishes the cellular fuel that stress depletes. Targeted interventions address your specific bottlenecks rather than applying generic wellness advice that may or may not apply to your situation.

The results aren't subtle. Executives who optimize through this model consistently report sharper thinking, more stable energy throughout demanding days, improved stress tolerance, better sleep, and sustained physical capacity. Not because they're taking shortcuts, but because their biology is finally supporting their demands instead of limiting them.

**LV Longevity Lab: Built for Vegas High Performers**

For executives in Las Vegas, LV Longevity Lab provides this comprehensive approach locally.

Dr. Wallace Brucker leads the practice with credentials that explain why he understands high-performance demands. West Point graduate. Thirty years in military medicine including optimization work with Army Special Forces, Navy SEALs, and Airborne units—populations where suboptimal performance wasn't acceptable. Board-certified orthopedic surgeon for over two decades. Fellowship-trained in anti-aging and functional medicine through the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.

His entire career has centered on keeping elite performers operating at peak capacity. Now he applies that expertise to Las Vegas executives who refuse to accept unnecessary decline.

Margaret Brucker, PA-C, brings 30 years of clinical experience and her own fellowship certification in anti-aging medicine to patient care. She manages hormone replacement protocols, GLP-1 weight management programs, and IV therapies with the attentiveness and accessibility that concierge medicine promises. As a former military spouse who built her career while raising three children, she understands the competing demands that make health optimization feel impossible through conventional channels.

The practice offers comprehensive services: hormone optimization for men and women, NAD+ and glutathione IV therapies, mitochondrial testing, advanced cancer screening with the Galleri blood test, genetic analysis, regenerative treatments, and the ongoing physician relationship that makes sustained optimization possible.

**The Question You Should Be Asking**

If your last physical said everything was normal but you feel far from optimal, the right response isn't acceptance. It's skepticism about the tools being used to evaluate you.

Normal doesn't mean good. Normal doesn't mean optimized. Normal just means you haven't deteriorated enough to cross a disease threshold yet.

For executives whose performance, income, and impact depend on operating at full capacity, ""not yet diseased"" is a pathetically low bar. You wouldn't accept 60 percent efficiency from your team, your systems, or your investments. Why accept it from your body?

The Las Vegas executives who've moved to concierge longevity medicine aren't doing it because they have more time or disposable income than everyone else. They're doing it because they got tired of feeling tired. They stopped believing the lie that everything was fine when everything clearly wasn't. They found physicians who could actually identify what was wrong and fix it.

**You're Not Imagining It**

That persistent fatigue isn't laziness. The brain fog isn't just stress. The declining stamina isn't inevitable aging you should accept in your 40s or 50s. Something is actually wrong—it's just something conventional medicine isn't equipped to find or fix.

There's a different model that can. And for executives in Las Vegas, it's available right here.

Stop settling for ""normal"" when you know something's off. Your instincts are right. The testing has just been wrong.

The Green Lounge is set to open at 66 Parliament Street, in the former Rum Baba’s site.

Founder Maria Bostock confirmed the decision on Wednesday, saying planning approval had been granted following what she described as nearly three months of waiting.

The confirmation came on her birthday, marking a significant milestone for the long-running project.

Also in the news

[](https://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/man-avoids-jail-after-sharing-vile-child-fantasies-with-undercover-officer-873656)[](https://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/anti-vax-campaigner-fined-for-breaching-restraining-order-873913)[](https://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/entertainment/manx-language-shopping-bag-launches-as-part-of-treisht26-programme-873542)[](https://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/man-banned-from-driving-for-seven-years-after-drink-driving-incidents-872539)

The decision was made by officers under delegated powers rather than going in front of the planning committee.

The proposal is for a coffee shop with a target to cater for medical marijuana users.

The planning officer Chris Balmer said in his report that ‘while the target audience is unusual, the proposed activities included in the planning statement do not extend beyond the scope of a normal coffee shop, and it will be assessed as such’.

But, the Design Out of Crime Officer objected to the proposal, citing concerns around security and safeguarding.

These included the need for CCTV, alarms, security lighting, certified doors and additional access controls, as well as measures to address potential drug misuse, safe disposal and the risk of customers driving under the influence.

However, the planning officer said these were not planning considerations given the use was just a coffee shop.

‘I am so happy to reveal that today I finally got the planning approval through for The Green Lounge,’ Maria said.

‘After nearly three months of waiting, holding my nerve, and keeping everything moving quietly in the background, it’s done.’

The venue has been proposed as an alcohol-free community space focused on education, wellbeing and support for medicinal cannabis patients, alongside creative workshops and events.

Despite the extended planning process, Maria said work on the premises had continued throughout.

‘While the paperwork crawled along, I didn’t stop. I’ve been working every single day to get the Lounge ready, building it properly, carefully, and with intention,’ she said.

‘It’s been a lesson in patience, trust, and staying focused even when everything feels stuck.’

With approval now secured, the Green Lounge will open Consumption Passes this Friday.

These will operate as pre-launch passes ahead of the venue’s planned opening at the end of February.

‘These will be pre-launch passes for our opening at the end of February, with full details shared at release. Passes will activate once the Lounge officially opens,’ Maria said.

The Consumption Pass system is intended for patients who legally use medicinal cannabis and wish to do so in a private, controlled and stigma-free environment.

The founders have previously stressed that smoking will not be permitted inside the venue and that only medical vaporisation will be allowed for verified pass holders, with the wider café space remaining open to adults over 18.

The project has generated public discussion since it was first announced, in part because it represents a first for the island.

Maria and fellow co-founder Daisy-May Green have previously described the Green Lounge as ‘for patients, by patients’, saying it was designed to address gaps in support, education and safe social spaces for those using cannabis for medical reasons.

The lounge is expected to host non-alcoholic refreshments, wellbeing events, creative workshops and collaborations with local artists and educators, while also aiming to bring new life to a prominent Ramsey town centre building.

Progress has not been without difficulty.

In earlier updates, Maria said the latter part of 2025 had been particularly challenging, describing December as a period that ‘threw every challenge it had’ at the project.

Even so, she remained determined to continue.

‘This project has tested me more than anything I’ve done before, but it’s also shown me what persistence really looks like,’ she said.

‘Thank you to everyone who’s supported, checked in, believed, and waited alongside me during this unbelievably stressful process.’

With planning approval now in place, the Green Lounge team say they are focused on final preparations ahead of opening later this winter.

‘What an incredible birthday present,’ Maria added. ‘I can’t wait to finally welcome you all in.’

My hair is brown and my eyes are gray. I have one hundred and forty three freckles on my nose and my cheeks and eight of them are on the tops of my lips. I am also the most unlikable, miserable sack of shit you will ever meet in your life, and yes, my house really is haunted by a bitch ass ghost that loves Dragon Ball Z. 

It wasn't always this way. Until a few years ago I was actually rather popular. I would go to the movies with my friends and we would laugh and talk in hushed tones about who was pretty and who was mean and who put on too much makeup too incorrectly. I was even favored by boys my age every now and then. They would try to make me laugh and pretend to like the music of every band that I ever wore on my shirt.

I was happy then. I showered. I was kind. 

And now there is dirt under my chipped fingernails. My lips are chapped and I let them crack and bleed, and when someone looks at or talks to me it is only because they absolutely have to do it. I haven't said a nice thing to anyone in two years, just as no one has said a nice thing to me. I am well and truly hated, and I am unrelentingly alone.

I'll tell you what happened. I *am* ashamed of it, but shame is my constant nosy companion, squeezing its way rudely into every human interaction I have, so I hardly care if I spill some of it all over my keyboard for the whole internet to see.

Ready?

Two years ago I took a brainmelting amount of LSD and ended up well and truly naked in a Chucky Cheese ball pit, doing unspeakable things to myself for everyone to see. 

You can laugh. It's a joke alright. But it's not a joke that I am playing on you, dear reader. It's a joke that the universe played on me, and it isnt all that fucking funny, is it?

Now everyone thinks I'm a… you know. 

I don't even want to say it, the thought of it is sickening to me. And I'm not. I feel like I have to say that I'm not because everyone in my fuckass shitty town knows me and thinks that I am and I can't leave.

 I am so alone. I am hated, so I spend my days hating back. I am a bitch to everyone I meet just for the small fraction of security that I get from being the first of two inevitable aggressors in any given conversation. I don't hold doors for old women. I don't say thank you, I don't tip, and If you have eaten at the Mcdonalds in Exeter, New Hampshire, you have eaten my spit.

That's why I was more annoyed than anything when I found out my house was actually haunted. Because if ghosts are real, then heaven and hell are real too, right? You could probably guess that I'm not one of those heaven girls. Maybe I could have wormed my way in there before my little incident, but now I'm sure there's a special place for me in the inferno. 

Listen, I know what you're thinking, what you wish you could tell me; “Masie! The christian God is very forgiving so why don't you just change your ways and be a sweet, nice girl so that you can go to heaven when you die?” You're probably thinking something like that, right?

No.

No way.

You couldn't understand the betrayal I feel. *Everyone* knows me and *everyone* treats me like trash. I won't be nice to them just to get into some fruity ass, self righteous, gated community in the clouds full of people who treat me like garbage. I'm going to treat everyone just how they treat me, and if that lifestyle drags me down to hell, then I'll go, kicking and screaming and spitting in big macs all the while. 

And yes the bitch ass ghost is one of those christian ghosts. I know because crosses drive him fucking nuts. Took me forever to figure that out though.

You see, after that unspeakable incident at Chucky Cheese, my decrepit father was so repulsed by me that he refused to live with me all together. He had some money stashed away from a life insurance policy on my mom and used it to buy me a ramshackle house on the other side of town. No doubt he would have sent me farther away if he could find a different place for so cheap, but the house was (and is) falling apart. How it has heat and electricity in its state is a marvel. There are entire human sized holes connecting the top floor to the bottom and absurd splatters of blood still on the floral wall paper. Which brings me to the other reason why this house was so cheap.  It was on one of those, “an entire family got brutally axe murdered here” discounts. 

They were called the Stevens. A picture of the four of them still hangs up in the living room simply because I feel like it looks kind of cool, and Im too lazy and miserable to be fucked putting up other decorations. Anyways, the story goes that one night, Mr Stevens gambled away all of his family's money and was so ashamed of it all that he decided to kill them with an axe when he went home and then shoot himself in the head for good measure. Complete pussy if you ask me. He should have just lived with it. You don't see me axe murdering my entire family just because I messed up. That type of thing is just immature to be honest with you.

 Judging from the picture on the wall, they were a nice family. It's one of those blindingly caucasian photos taken on some beach in the vineyard. Four blondies with massive, obnoxious smiles, lips peeling back from their white teeth to show off their giant gums. A little boy and a little girl and a dog and of course their dog was a golden retriever and of course they got him to look at the camera somehow. A family so perfect that it's almost obvious that they would axe murder each other. The universe craves balance, I think.

One of them is still in my fucking house.

It took me a while to notice it. When I first moved in things would raddle, doors would slam, and the microwave would turn on for no reason, but I assumed that was just the house settling or whatever. The weird thing was that stuff like this would only ever happen when I was upstairs. Say I was upstairs in my bed. I would undeniably hear the microwave turn on, or the tv, and sprint down stairs to check it out, only for it to be off like normal when I got down there. Can you imagine how frustrating this was? Imagine \*you're\* upstairs in \*your\* bed and you swear up and down that you hear \*your\* tv turn on, so you run downstairs to check it and it's not. You would think you're going insane. I thought I was going insane. I thought so for a while. It seemed like the only logical next step in my life. I became a public outcast and everyone hated me, and then I began to spend all my time alone in an axe murderer's house that was falling apart. At some point I thought that becoming well and truly insane seemed like it fit logically in the downward spiral of my loser ass existence, so It wasn't long before I made peace with going nuts. Like I said, it seemed natural.

 But after my bearded dragon committed suicide I knew something was up.

I loved that thing. I remember I got him at Petco when he was just a little baby. I named him Hammy and I'm not ashamed to admit that I thought about him constantly throughout the day. I fed him lettuce and grasshoppers and the last tiny little drop of love that still floated around in my black heart, I gave to him. He was the only thing in the entire world that loved my company, that craved my touch. I would take him out of his tank and lay him on my chest and pet him and share popcorn with him while I watched romcoms and I swear he liked it.

A few times a week I would wake up in the middle of the night, scared with no real rationality, that something might have happened to him. I would stumble down stairs to check on him and adjust his heat lamp or give him a snack. More than once when I did this I would find him levitating in his tank, only for him to resume his relationship with gravity the moment I saw him. As you can imagine, I thought this was just a normal part of going insane. He seemed completely fine whenever this happened, and I liked to believe Hammy was too mature to believe in childish things like ghosts so I didn't ask him about it.

And then one day I got home from work and he was dead on the floor, with a little blood trail leading from his tank to the TV remote, where he lay dead in a poignant pool of himself. I cried all night. Loud and ugly I cried. I screamed, I bit the skin on my hand to release the pressure of it all until I tasted my own blood then I went to my kitchen and threw plates on the floor until I got too tired to stand. 

In my bed, with the lights off, I held Hammy’s limp body close to my chest and pet his head, and in the corner of my room, where the darkest shadows converged and blended together, the silhouette of a boy looked down at me.

 I looked back.

I was scared. Even If I was going insane, it's scary to see the silhouette of a shadowman in a busted ass murder house.

“Hello?” I asked softly. 

At that my bedroom door flew open and the boyish shadow slipped out into the hallway and slammed the door hard behind him.

The door had slammed. 

I saw it.

This wasn't the vague sound of the TV playing from downstairs or the absurd image of hammy floating on the teetering edge for my sub par vision. That door really slammed itself shut, My heart was still beating hard, offended by the sound of it.

Maybe my house really was haunted.

And if my house was haunted, whoever haunted it was a fucking pussy. Only doing haunted shit when it thought I wasn't looking, Picking up *my* bearded dragon and putting him down right when I got there, making me think I'm insane.

What a bitch ass ghost. What was he scared of? Hes the fucking ghost. I'm just a girl, and he’s got the nerve to secretly haunt all my shit when I'm not looking, not even scaring me like he's supposed to, and then he decides to go and murder my bearded dragon?

Oh dear reader, whoever you are. I cannot explain to you everything that I felt that night, only that I sat in my bed and stewed in it all until the sun came up, and when it did, I kicked on my shoes and walked right out of the door with no coffee or anything, I didn't even put down Hammy as I went. Instead, I placed him gingerly in my hoodie pocket. I wasn't going to leave the body of my only worldly companion alone with that bitch ass ghost.

Some time later I pulled into Micheals craft store and got my hands on glue, double sided tape, and a bunch of popsicle sticks. The jowly lady at the cash register recognised me as I put my things down. I waited to see if she had the nuts to say anything, she did.

“Pervert.” she muttered softly as she looked down to finish scanning the things that I bought. I could tell she had been psyching herself up to say it.

“Thats nice, why dont you go fuck yourself?”

“Uh!” she gasped, gelatinous jowls flopping about as she jerked her head back in surprise.

“That will be twenty five ninety nine, would you like to round up one cent to charity?”

“No.”

\*\*\*

Some time later, I pulled back into my house, parked haphazardly in the driveway and stalked through the rain into my house, that was mine, and absolutely not a ghost’s if I had anything to say about it. I went up to my room, sat on my bed, threw my thin blanket over myself so that no ghosts could see what I was doing, and got to work. A few hours later I had fifty or so crosses made from popsicle sticks. I laid Hammy’s little body gently down on my bed as I stood up and began sticking those little crosses on all of the walls in my room, slowly making my way through all of the rooms upstairs and then down. 

At first, the ghost acted like nothing was happening. But as I got downstairs, things started to go haywire. Lights flickered on and off, chairs fell down, and the curtains shook harder with every new cross I stuck to the walls. The more I put up, the more everything began to bug the fuck out. If I put enough crosses up in a room, the poltergeist would move into the next room, like I had forced it out. When I made it into the kitchen, the gas stove turned on, and broken shards of porcelain dishes flew at me from the ground where I had shattered them the night before. Not hard enough to kill me mind you, but a few cut my arms and my forehead.

It really was a bitch ass ghost.

It wasn't long before I began shouting.

“How about that? You bitch ass ghost. Im got gonna stop putting these up until you get the fuck out of my house and leave me alone.”

Soon enough, I had a crosses in every room but the bathroom, and three crosses left in my hand. The bathroom door had slammed closed and the light was flickering on and off from the crack in the door. I met some resistance at the door like someone was holding it shut. So I put my crosses and tape in my pockets, wrapped both hands around the door knob, put one foot up on the wall, and with my whole body I ripped the door open easily. When I looked in the bathroom mirror, I saw why it was so easy. Standing behind my reflection, crying, was a little boy.

The boy in the family portrait. He looked the same as he did on that beach, except for a massive gaping wound in his left temple. I could see a sliver his pulsating brain. like a ball of masticated fruit gushers.

“Please stop.”

“You killed my bearded dragon.”

He was sobbing, but he kept looking at me. I guess he was sort of brave for that. He didn't look older than nine or ten.

“I know. I thought… I'm so sorry I thought that I could… I'm really so sorry, I didn't mean for him to die.”

“You thought what?”

As I said it, I waved my handful of popsicle stick crosses behind me, and in the mirror I saw him cower and shrink as they passed by him.”

“I thought that If I possessed him and made him use the tv remote, you would just think that maybe he wanted to watch tv sometimes.” he said through disgusting wet sobs.

“That doesn't make sense.”

“I know, I'm sorry, okay? I loved Hammy, just like you.”

“You killed him though.”

This made him cry even harder. His face was soaking wet with it.

“I know, I'm sorry. I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself.”

“Why didn't you just turn on the tv yourself?” I asked the little ghost in the mirror.

“B-because I thought tha-that you-you-you would exorcize me if you knew I was-s here.” 

Snot was leaking from his nose now. For a while I listened to the sounds of him cry mix with the rainstorm outside.

The silence became too much for him before it became too much for me and so he continued to let his ghostly heart bubble and froth over me through his wet little sobs.

“The truth is, I don't wanna d-die until I f-finish watching Dragonball.”

I was shocked. “Dragonball?” 

“Y-yeah. I love Vegeta so much. He's so powerful and I love it so much when he shoots his big power blast.” He was crying even harder now. “I love Vegeta so damn much. I wish I was more like him and not so scared of everything. I hate myself.”

“I-I have crunchyroll.”

He looked up at me and mopped up his tears with a bloody sweater sleeve.

“What's crunchyroll?”

\*\*\*

Some time later, when I had taken down all the crosses from my house and thrown them outside, and Hammy was buried lovingly in the dirt outside my window with a little popsicle stick headstone, I put on my pajamas and sat on the couch. I could still hear the rain battering my flimsy wooden house as I crawled under a blanket and put on episode 86 of Dragon Ball Z. Colors and flashes barfed out of my screen as I watched stupidly. After a few episodes I felt a pressure on my shoulder, which tumbled slowly into my lap. I heard soft snoring coming from that empty void between my thighs and my chin.

Nobody had touched me on purpose for two years. I had forgotten how warm people are. How your body tingles when someone breathes on you.

 My bottom lip quivered as tears rolled down my chin and landed in mid air, on that nothing that snored in my lap.",3,1769805035.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

When I was applying, I was excited for this promise as a vegetarian. As a second year though looking at this marketing now, I am less than impressed - You can also look at it as 50% animal based food... Interestingly though, apparently in the middle of 2023 only 24% of options were plant-based, which is crazy to me. In terms of improvements, Commons is decent (but is still not healthy), but Crossroads for one thing remains limited. For example the Black bean burger seems like an afterthought when you compare it to all of the veggie/Beyond burger options at Commons, and look at the Chef's/Daily Specials - Only meat with only the rare vegetarian alternative! Even Commons has taken one of those rare Crossroads ones, 3 cheese tortellini, to offer it daily.

What's more, originally I thought this promise was for the beginning of 2025, but if you look at some details in articles I found out they meant the end - Okay, it is 2026 now, and still few changes. And what made me even post this, is that as seen in the below image, they still haven't even updated [rit.edu/dining](http://rit.edu/dining), the 2025 promise is still there. I hope to see RIT Dining do better.

Started my day fresh , figuring out what to do next. Started messaging my roster and the one I had marked favourite replies she can make it today. Let’s call her D, this one I had messaged her a couple of days before I landed in Pattaya and laid down the foundation. She had good English, probably the best written English I’ve countered with Thai girls during the whole trip. So we hit it off , and because she knew English i wasn’t kinda sleezy with her and kinda conversed nicely on how where what you do I do etc. During this time, I had asked her to verify on video call because she was just too good on the photo. She denied saying after we met if I don’t look like the photo , I could reject her and she won’t mind. I’m a bit taken back, that level of confidence. Wow.  😮 so I play along and keep her warm until I land by dropping my travel updates every few days. 

Photo on TF looked a classy say a 9. Great picture with fancy background, great one piece dress, beautiful face and slim with right amount of boob mass. She says she can come in at 7 as she is working in an office and can only make it in the evenings. And it’s still 1 or 2 in the afternoon, I chill by the pool at my hotel 🏨 take some afternoon walk nearby and come back to room around 6. 

Have my coffee and smoke in the room balcony and as the time inches towards 7 pm by heart starts pounding faster. Can feel the change. Say to myself relax have another smoke and listen to some music. 

Cut it it’s 7 and i get a message , I’m here - room number ? I give the room number and ask should I come down to pick you up ? Strangely she said no - and for this instance I did not get a call from the reception confirming guest visit and then I hire the door bell ring - chirrr chirr ( yeah that’s the wired ass door bell tone I got in my room ) 

 

Heart pounding faster, I look from the key hole and i can see a lady in a black one piece bit unclear, excitement exploding in my dick. It’s like that feeling when you first date and meet for the 1st time. I open the door and booom there she is. Intact far better than the photo and with a great smile we shake our hand I welcome her in. I offer her beer or cold drinks , she says she doesn’t drink beer and chooses water. I keep looking at her not knowing what to do next and kinda utter the holy words - wanna take a shower first ? 😂 she says yes goes in while i sit and wait on the chair and then comes out with a towel draped. 

I get close to her, I get the smell of her body lotion., kinda vanilla. We start with a hug , kiss and open her drape, and long behold - a perfect set of boobs , neither too large nor too small not natural though but handful. And pointy tits sprouting out probably a good 1-2 cms. We have a lot of foreplay , she sucks me licks my tip balls etc. I suck kiss leave love bites around with her boobs , she asks me not to place love bites I oblige and start going down and fingering her pussy. At this point , I’m on the edge of the bed with my cock in her mouth and she’s on the bed sideways and i’m fingering her good. I say it’s time and put on a condom and we hump good , try out different positions and in the heat of the moment , I give her multiple love bites on her boobs 😂 she says don’t do it but i kinda continue and at a point doesn’t ask me to stop instead continues moaning. 

I’m close to climax but I say i wanna cim. She says no and says I can do on her face. Not bad i say and I remove the condom and ask her to give me a bj. But instead of swallowing the head , I ask her to just lick the tip and start from the base and later focus on the frenulum which is below the tip if the penis. She says ok and slowly sucks the bottom tip of my penis like a lollypop. The excitement level inside me has hit the ceiling. This goes on for like 15 mins or time slowed down I don’t know and neither she was looking at the time or rushed. 

She continues with constant eye contact keeping a check on my expressions and if I smile she smiles back. This had to be the one of greatest memory snapshot - smiling with my dick in her mouth. She continues to now make it a bit sloppy, tries to take it fully inside her mouth but can’t and gags , I push harder and gags. Now I turn her back towards the bed wall , I stand on the bed and face fuck her. Still she can’t take it fully inside and starts to gag once 3/4 of the length is reached. Her eyes start to tear up 😹 tears of joy i call out and she laughs. 

Eventually, i can’t control it any longer and I cum on her lips while her lips are closed , she drains me to make sure not a drop falls on the bed with her hand below her mouth to catch any if spills. Runs to the bathroom to cleanup , I wait for her looking at myself in the mirror , grinning ear to ear , bringing myself to reality from the fantasy land. She comes out of the bathroom , I clean up and we talk for a few mins, I ask her out for a beer at a club etc she says she doesn’t go to clubs etc or rather has stopped and need to get back home and sleep early. I ask can I see you again , she says yes and we hug and she leaves. 

Now the reception calls me to check if everything is ok. I still don’t understand why did they not call me before checkin ? Do you guys know ? 

Anyway I say to myself , I’m fucking exhausted. Have a beer and smoke in the balcony order a MCD burger to the room, feels so good, although I’ve had it like a million times. 

Just around 11, I get a msg from her saying good night , that’s it. I say to myself , dude looks like I’ve caught a great catch on my hands here. 

whatta day mate, what a fooooking day! I exclaim and go to sleep 🛌 😴 

P.S - today is my last night in Pattaya , so i’m going to post all the days report all at once when I get some time from draining my balls every now and then! ",4,1769804751.0,Pattaya,2,0.7,False

*These 2 episodes were a serious rollercoaster, it gave me the best comedy since Love like the Galaxy*

# Episode 17 – Midnight Panic, Shirt-Ripping Mission, and Almost Confessions

Episode 17 starts with a spooked Huan’er in the silent Gao mansion.

She goes to wake Haiming, who jumps into action as soon as she tells him there’s someone in the house.

[Huan'er asking the best questions](https://preview.redd.it/vu8dxodegjgg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7e1ee66f0d74e4ba222469aef967b96fa6a659)

They cautiously explore the house before coming across Housekeeper Fang, who snuck into the house to get some things. Huan’er is trying to make sense of it all and, a couple of times, Housekeeper Fang almost spills out the truth, but Huan’er quickly figures out that Haiming has piled up a lot of little white lies just to be alone in the house with her.

Huan’er wants to go home, but Housekeeper Fang finally gets the main gist of her boss’s plan and makes a dash out of the house. Huan’er is annoyed at Haiming but realizes he truly is running a fever. She gets him back into bed and stays by his side.

[Cheeky Haiming. Falling asleep on the same bad trope served!](https://preview.redd.it/wtbmdmmjijgg1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc869d5765b13d3df92499b4490cf24b290b513)

By morning we see she’s asleep on the bed right next to Haiming, who wakes up before her and looks at her in wonder. He almost touches her hair but pretends to be asleep when she stirs. Huan’er wakes up horrified that she’s in the same bed as him, way too close for her poor heart, and sneaks out of the room.

[Great idea, System!](https://preview.redd.it/omlj8hvnijgg1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e1fef8d3ada694d1af9609caebfd6b08bf8d0b1)

The System then tells her she’s slacking off and issues a random quest. She has to tear his clothes off within 24 hours. Huan’er tries to find a loophole, but the System has grown smarter and refuses to allow it. If she fails, Haiming will stay sick for three more days. Huan’er refuses to let that happen, even if he is supposedly just a fictional character.

Time is ticking and Huan’er becomes more and more unhinged. We even get POV scenes of her trying to rip off his clothes using various tricks and methods while Haiming becomes increasingly alarmed by her behavior.

[The POV, his face, everything had me cracking up](https://preview.redd.it/ay6mrj5jjjgg1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=41ebc2495b699bd776bc3b5e6694a44b38891a09)

*I hadn’t laughed this much since the Chicken Wings and Embroidered Rat episode in Love Like the Galaxy.*

The scene where Haiming finds her destroying his shirt is priceless. He stays so matter of fact and unfazed while she’s in full chaos mode.

[Haiming is scared](https://preview.redd.it/z85zcng8ljgg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=1664a943efec5d91956ba9f7a2459afc2a7cfc79)

Left with no choice, she sneaks into his bedroom at night and tears his shirt off while he sleeps.

https://preview.redd.it/to1yoqpjljgg1.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=31bca8cc2449cb856f05ee21bdfe651fa6ebf653

Thinking she can slip away unnoticed, of course Haiming grabs her wrist. The look of longing between them, the way his thumb rubs her wrist where he can feel her heartbeat going wild… *I might have rewatched this scene a couple of times.*

[SWOOOOOOOON](https://preview.redd.it/1x9ymjplljgg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35c037853056a0ac0bcf42611160d1e04636803)

Huan’er still doesn’t want Haiming to kiss her, but he gently pulls her hand away and kisses her. CXX really knows what he’s doing with his hands. I was so engrossed in the moment that I was genuinely frustrated when she breaks off the kiss and runs away.

The next morning Haiming is setting up breakfast for the two of them.

*And seriously, what is it with this bright green jumper? Did they buy green props in bulk for this show?*

But Huan’er has already left the house.

Mengmeng is meeting Tiehan again at school, still a weird meeting spot, but at least this time it’s for a good reason, he wants her to practice her signing in a public place. While waiting for Tiehan to show up, she grills Huan’er on the phone about her overnight stay at Haiming's, asking if things are progressing. *Mengmeng, we all want progress too. We want all the tea too!*

Haiming’s fondness has jumped to 84%, leaving Huan’er wondering what happened between last night’s shirt tearing at 83% and this morning. *He’s busy thinking about you, dummy. He even bought heart shaped salted egg custard baos for breakfast and you ran away.*

https://preview.redd.it/ewe2q4jsljgg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=311689932958ef31a29fd22e2f90d229215f0552

Haiming turns on the charm, leaving coffee and notes on her desk while she skulks around trying to avoid him like the plague. He corners her at the tea station and asks when she’s going to come clean and answer his question. She splutters and tries to change the subject, but Haiming won’t budge, trapping her neatly between the counter and himself.

[That jawline alone is making weak in the knee](https://preview.redd.it/1ud3gceoojgg1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=0edf1a3aa4b58bbc649e6eed2472acc699e3998e)

A couple of Letao employees see them and scurry away gossiping, but Haiming doesn’t care at all. Confident Haiming is really something.

Office gossip goes wild while Assistant Luo plays cupid. Ironically, Huan’er asks Luo how to make Haiming like her less. Luo’s face is priceless

Then Chairman Gao calls. Huan’er answers with a confused “*Who is this*?” and I was cackling because no one ever talks to him like that. He goes on a rant, accusing her of chasing his son’s money and ruining sales. Like how are those two things even related?

*What’s interesting is that Huan’er doesn’t deny loving Haiming this time.* Instead, she asks why she couldn’t truly love him. Chairman Gao keeps ranting about sales and market shares and threatens to Haiming from this project and find him a more suitable life partner. *Dream on, Chairman Gao. As if Haiming would let that happen.*

Later, Huan’er works late, *and honestly girl, why are you working this hard in a fictional world?* Assistant Luo shows her Haiming on a business magazine cover and you can almost see the sales strategy forming in her brain.

# Episode 18 – Kidnapping Chaos, Hospital Truths, and Feelings Getting Serious

A few days later, Chairman Gao storms into the office furious that Haiming is on a magazine cover endorsing female hygiene products. *Well, you’re the sanitary pad king or you’re not.*

Chairman Gao is about to explode while yelling at Huan’er, who calmly explains how this helps sales. Haiming arrives and says he doesn’t mind endorsing women’s products if it serves a good cause. *Haiming advocating for women’s wellbeing, me likey!* His father nearly explodes until a board member reminds him everyone can hear him yelling in the office and to calm down.

Huan’er defends Haiming, asking why he can’t simply support his son. Fondness jumps to 88% because honestly, who wouldn’t fall harder when someone stands up for you like that?

Then things turn serious : Le’er has disappeared. Haiming grabs Huan’er and they rush out without bothering to explain anything.

They search frantically, eventually finding Le’er’s backpack near the place she feeds stray animals. Huan’er then remembers Scumbag once approached Le’er, and thinking the worst, they rush to an abandoned building where, surprise, Scumbag indeed kidnapped the little sis.

Scumbag's gone completely unhinged, blaming Huan’er for ruining his life. *Like you did this on your own, like a big boy, without anyone's help, fuckface!*

Haiming sneaks up behind him and knocks him out while Huan'er was distracting him, but Scumbag wakes again and attacks, forcing Haiming to shield Huan’er from the chair he was hurling at her. Haiming turns and knocks him out properly. Finally!

At the hospital, Haiming’s injuries turn out minor and Le’er is safe home. Huan’er steps out to question the System, which casually admits it pushed Scumbag into madness to move the plot along. That is seriously twisted.

She asks about her developing feelings, and the System reminds her it's all a dream and this world will disappear when she wakes up. She vents to Mengmeng, who calmly tells her you don’t choose love, it just happens, and slyly points out she’s finally admitting her feelings.

Mengmeng also reveals she changed her novel so her characters love freely without regret. Huan’er clearly takes that to heart.

The next morning, Assistant Luo arrives to pick up Haiming from the hospital. *Haiming wearing the most aggressively 90s striped shirt imaginable hurt my eyes*. What happened to our usually polished CEO?

Haiming is fiddling with Huan’er’s pager, puzzled since it flashed all night even though he couldn’t see anything. When Huan’er arrives, she sees fondness has jumped to 95%, which clearly explain why he's looking completely lovesick while she's scolding him.

Luo tries to give them alone time again, conveniently disappearing once they reach the Gao mansion.

Housekeeper Fang and Butler Lu get caught in Haiming’s little schemes and both run away while Huan’er rants at him for his lies. Still, she stays to help him work and care for his injuries.

When he starts removing his shirt so she can check his injuries, she suddenly gets shy. *Where is the girl who used to boldly chase him around? Now she blushes at the slightest glimpse of skin, and honestly we wouldn’t have minded more than a glimpse.*

Haiming then asks her, as a psychology major, about a “friend” whose crush keeps avoiding him. She catches on and tries to dodge the question, saying things are complicated.

[Cue the classic fall into ML’s lap trope.](https://preview.redd.it/36xr7sogpjgg1.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3db80162be22c9e616d0f4b14f353f73fbec397)

She finally admits that relationships simply take time and patience. Haiming smiles and says he’ll wait, today, tomorrow, however long it takes. Heart-melting!

On the Tiehan and Mengmeng side, things are improving. Tiehan is finally supporting her totally and pushing her to chase her singing ambitions. He’s not fully redeemed yet, but at least he’s learning.

*And my preferred theory still stands. Huan’er may actually be inside Mengmeng’s novel, Haiming exists somewhere caring for her, already in love, and the pager is really just measuring her own growing feelings.*

Wow, never thought I'd post here about this again but here I am, nearly 4 years later. For anyone curious there's a link above to the related post. While it's not a lot to read I feel like doing a TLDR about it would do everything that happened then would be an injustice to it so I highly suggest giving THAT a read first then coming back. Also, this post is LONG, so str

So, I (28 NB) have been living with my gramma (F 71 almost 72) since around October of 2024 due to things I'll get to elsewhere. Safe to say I was actually wrong about her and was given a new perspective. While the things in the previous post did happen, they were warped in a way to make Gramma look bad. The thing she said at the wedding? She's very protective over the title gramma due to her grandmother being called ""Grannyma"" and her mom being ""Granny"" (Grannyma was a mash of Granny and mom, thus the name) which, while not the best look in the moment is understandable given the context (I believe it could have been worded better or just not said at all.)

Mom coming home and crying and hugging me after being scolded by gramma? Mom actually instigated it by yelling at gramma and my wheelchair-bound uncle (he's triplegic, can only use one limb) upon getting there to help and a god chunk of the way home, basically saying she made a mistake in helping them and stopped somewhere (Idr where exactly, I think it was a gas station) and went in side, gramma managed to talk mom back into driving because they had no other way of getting home safely (again, triplegic uncle!)

The manipulation? That was likely a mix of my mom and my cousin I call an aunt, she doesn't pop up much here so she won't be named. They made things out to look worse than they were. Example; Once my gramma left her phone at my other uncle's home (not WBU, my mom's youngest brother) after going through some recordings of her former boss. I don't remember the reason why she was doing that but it might have been to clear out old ones or something. But she left it there and accidentally left the recorder app open, not recording or anything but the app was open. This was seen as her trying to listen in on them but she says it wasn't. At the time, I believed that gramma was trying to record them and this experience made gramma uninstall the recorder app (an app mom told gramma to get to use to record gramma's boss for some reason, not sure on specifics I'm sorry but I know mom told gramma it would be helpful)

But I don't believe it now because I've seen gramma leave her phone everywhere, in the kitchen, in her car, heck she accidentally left it at the store once and often leaves it at home when going out. I remind her on occasion ""Got your phone?"" And she goes ""Ah dang it!"" Or something and turns around and grabs it. She'd forget her heads if it wasn't attached (her words not mine lol) Point is, she's not as attached to her phone as the rest of us.

Ok, that all aside, onto why I'm now living with my gramma. As stated before I've been living with my gramma for a little over a year now. (Moved in around mid-late October 2024).

I'll start from the beginning, or as best as I can.

Back in 2023 (I think like august or something, I'm not sure time was a blur at this point and days melded together like melded Neapolitan Ice-cream on the sidewalk on a hot summer day so it could have been later or earlier, later on time gets a bit clearer due to messages and timestamps from them) Mom and dad started proceedings to get a divorce. It took a while because dad was a wreck but eventually it was finalized on January 14 2024 (remember this date, it becomes relevant later I promise). Mom moved on quick once the divorce was underway. It wasn't pretty. There was yelling and screaming and crying, mostly from my dad but he eventually left (read ""kicked out""), the house is in mom's name so it made sense.

Mom moved on quick, within a week of dad being kicked out a new man moved in. They had only gone on one date prior, I was the one who answered the door and let this bastard in. He seemed nice at the time but... I regret letting him in for reasons you'll learn later on dear reader. Now to be fair and to give as much context as possible they knew each other before I was born (I'm roughly a month apart from his youngest or so and he was at my first birthday. Oh, and quick note, he's been married 3 times before dating mom, his 2nd and 3rd wife both giving him offspring. I know nothing about the first wife.) but he, let's call him Flag, and mom hadn't talked until months before the divorce was brought up. Not started, brought up. I have my own theories about their relationship honestly and none of them are good. But that's later

Side note; Mom was 17 when she met him and he was 31 I think so a 14 year age gap. Then again, she was 17 when she met my dad and he was in his early 20s (21 I think. From what I was told, she was going around saying she was 18, according to dad)

Side note 2; After Flag and mom started dating, Flag's previous 2 wives reached out to mom trying to say that Flag wasn't who he said he was. Mom didn't listen. The most recent wife eventually began stalking mom and Flag. Either Flag or mom or both told me that it was because MRW thought I was an affair baby due to being a month apart from his youngest and the fact that he was with mom (to her) meant it MUST be true (too much drama for my blood \*continues to type more drama\*)

ANYWAY; dad was on his own for a while and in a dark place. He eventually ended up in the hospital since he was just not keeping himself healthy. He wasn't eating, wasn't showering, nothing. He was literally wasting away. I went up there with my sort of sister (long story but she is neither legally nor biologically my sister, she's related to my legal brother. I mentioned her in a prior post that's easy to get to on my profile if you're interested. Though it's not relevant here) Holly and it was... A lot. He was a lot more sickly, he looked deflated and saggy, and was hooked up to a lot of machines because his heart was having trouble keeping up. He later told me, after we reconnected, that he was told by the doctor he was days away from dying his condition was so bad. We eventually had to be told to leave by a nurse cuz his heart rate was going too fast. It was honestly a lot. I remember it made Holly cry to the point of her having to park and call up mom and Flag so we could get a ride to get home safely. We were scolded because we were out late in a not so good part of town, but not super harshly. I don't remember much of it other than that it happened and honestly, that's kinda fair. Wrong time to do so though imo.

After that things didn't get much better for the family. Dad was continuing to try and ""win mom back"" which I'll get into more detail later on and it was ""scaring"" mom. I use quotation marks cuz looking back she wasn't really scared. She was acting scared cuz she had painted dad as an abuser. How do I know? Cuz of mom's actions. Before dad was kicked out mom would retaliate and yell back when dad got upset and was yelling. She'd yell and scream in anger, not fear. She'd approach him, not recoil away or anything. And she was like that the whole marriage. Mom used to get bruises a lot due to I think an iron deficiency or something, she got them even before she married dad just to be super clear! I remember asking her when I was like 9 or 10 about a new bruise and she said she ""bumped into something too hard"" or something similar. Mind you, they got married when I was 13 or 14 years old so I know this for a fact that he didn't hurt her. He once slapped me and for being aggressive (I don't remember why we were arguing and it's the only time he ever did that) and I later heard him sobbing in his room for doing so, later apologizing for doing so. It scared the crap outta me but I only put this because I know that if he actually hurt mom, he'd be a wreck. But she used it to paint that picture of him being an abuser.

Side note; I was a violent child before mom married dad, so much so that I was a danger to myself, mom, and eventually dad. I would go into blackout rage episodes and wouldn't remember these moments. Only reason I believe they actually happened was because of one particular episode where I didn't fully black out but I wasn't in control either. It was like I was a passenger in my own body, unable to control my own movements. I remember ones after that but only fuzzy bits and pieces and it's really hard to do so, like I'm actively repressing it even when trying to remember. Dad, being bigger than me (Dude used to be a bouncer at high end bars I think), would pin me down when I got so aggressive. Not painful but firm enough to keep me from getting free to cause harm. He told me this himself also saying he'd speak in a calm but firm tone, asking if I was done, until I wore myself out enough to not cause harm. I bring this up because mom tried to paint it as abuse later on, but I was thinking enough on it that I didn't believe her (I have a lot of repressed memories tied to my childhood, at least that's the best way I can describe it. I'm not sure if that's entirely true.)

She also acted scared when dad would come around to get his things, screaming and crying in hysteria which confused dad which doesn't align with her other behavior. But, in the moment, I believed my mom. I was under her roof and the way she painted things made it all seem believable. That and I had a lot of mental stuff going on at the time which I've since gotten help for.

Fast forward a bit to later in 2023 (again, things are a bit of a blur so I'm not super sure which month exactly), Mom and Flag go to Alaska and eventually fly Holly out there for about a week, it was originally going to be Holly, myself, and my legal brother El, but Holly wanted to go first due to stress at work or something. So she went earlier and me and El went a bit later. Mine and El's trip eventually comes around and the first day I'm having fun and experiencing nature. I'd never been to Alaska and it's gorgeous! However, next day the four of us go and do some stuff around the town for fun. I started to feel a sort of looming dread, a thickness in the atmosphere. Like there was something gripping at my spine between my shoulder blades and at the same time pushing down on my shoulders and chest. I just could feel something was just a bit more off about Flag, he was acting a bit colder in comparison to how he was before. Not much, but to me it was noticeable. I also saw how mom was acting, how happy she was but she also seemed a bit strained looking back.

It left a pit in my gut the whole trip. I tried to ignore it cuz mom had told me she ""needed someone"" when talking to me about Flag back before he moved in (She had pulled me aside to more or less ask for my permission/blessing to date him, this is where I learned he had been married and divorced 3 times and where I felt the first red flag about this guy was. How naive I was that it would only be the one red flag). How she ""couldn't be alone."" and ""I need to know if it's okay with you for him to move in."" At the time I said yes to him moving in, mostly cuz mom had seemed to be struggling after kicking dad out and I wanted her to be happy, but in that moment during the trip I began to regret it. In the moment I couldn't articulate my thoughts, but looking back I know it's because I could just feel that this man wasn't a good fit for my mom and that something was brewing.

I also felt kind of jealous, not of Flag but the fact that mom looked so happy there in Alaska... Without me. It was a weird and gross feeling and I did try to talk to mom about it. But my feelings were pushed aside because ""I'm just really happy here, why can't you be happy for me?"" Though looking back it was a mixture of emotions I didn't understand. I didn't grow up talking about my emotions, never really felt safe to do so, I wonder why. (I'm kidding I know why. My emotions were always intense and mom tried to get me to ""be quiet"" or ""calm down"" when I was a kid and expressed any intense emotion so I buried them. That probably led to a lot of my blow ups and blackout rage moments...)

Things after getting back from the trip didn't help me feel batter about things. El had moved in and Holly moved out. I moved into Holly's room cuz it was smaller but also cuz it was cheaper rent (Mom made that rule ""Smaller room cheaper rent""), which I needed cuz I was working part time at my job. But I was struggling to move my things. This led to one day El moving all my stuff from the bigger room, to the hallway in front of my smaller room. I came home from work and couldn't get into my room. I worked in a dog daycare at the time and was tired, my body was sore from wrangling dogs and my mind was fuzzy from trying to keep them all safe. So I blew up, saying it was unacceptable for him to just do that and block not only the entrance to my room but also the office (that one wasn't a big deal since mom was still in Alaska with Flag but it still blocked the other entry to my room through the jack and jill bathroom). I want to preface I know I could have handled things better, I know I should have done better about moving rooms, I know I was in the wrong. I do also want you all to know that A) I was going from basically a master bedroom sized room to a guest room so I was cramming a lot of things into a smaller bedroom and B) I was doing this by myself. I didn't feel comfortable asking El for help and I tried to keep my distance from him. Don't get me wrong, when he came home from the military earlier that year I tried to get along with him, I tried to connect, I tried to go out of my way to build up a relationship with him within my comfort zone so it was easy for me, but he didn't reciprocate. He would brush me off or would keep his responses as short as possible. I think he still has hurt feelings about how we broke up (We dated before he became my legal brother then broke up while he was in boot camp)

Side note; That post I mentioned Holly was in also has El in it and it shines a light on an earlier interaction that is likely playing a part in this. Again, not required to understand what's going on here but it'll probably help here. line [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16rm4xo/my_brother_m25_essentially_disrespected_me_about/)

Back on topic, while I was yelling like Lemongrab that him moving my things was ""Unacceptable!"" (Yes I said unacceptable, no it wasn't like Lemongrab, that would hurt my throat but I wanted to add a bit of humor because we all are gonna need some cope-ium for this post, trust me.) he stood up from the couch and got in my face, the only thing between us was a child gate we used to keep the dogs in/out of certain areas. Now this dude is like 6 feet tall if not a bit taller and I'm 5 feet 4 inches tall. This terrified the ever loving SHIT out of me. Not only is El tall but he's built due to him being in the military (I don't wanna say the branch specifically). I no longer felt safe in my own home. I don't remember what he said, all I remember is my ears ringing from being yelled at as if I were an unruly private in front of a pissed off drill sergeant and tearing up and shaking.

I hid as best as I could, texted mom and silently cried, covering my mouth to muffle as much noise as I could. I couldn't get to my room where I felt safe, only able to hide behind the wall that separated the hallway and the living room. What scared me the most was the fact that after he yelled at me, he sat back down and flipped a metaphorical switch and laughed at his show as if nothing happened. Eventually mom reached out to gramma and I went over there for a while, crying into her arms and telling her what happened while she tried to sooth me.

This is how I got back into contact with gramma after not speaking with her for years (I had cut contact back when I was 17 or 18 years old due to mom twisting gramma's actions and words to look worse than they were.) She helped me, even after I was awful to her. She said she forgives me and that she understands why I did it and she'd do it again in a heart beat. I'm so, so grateful to her. Now it wasn't exactly picture perfect either, I still had my twisted views of her for a while but over time I went over more and more just to get some respite from everything. Grammas house, once again, became a sort of safe haven, only a bit different. I helped out around the house instead of locking myself away in the office like I used to when I was younger. I brought over my dogs every time because like hell was I leaving them there, lets call them Bro-Bro and Lil-Man, and they got along with gramma's dog, I'll call her Princess.

Side note; After this she helped me organize my room. Well, I say helped but all she did was sit and point to things I needed to do, the most she actually did was help set aside clothes that fit, didn't fit, or I wasn't keeping and a helped a bit with putting up shelves when she was feeling up to it. It was all I needed and after about a week of that my room looked amazing and I was so proud of the work. I had asked my mom for this help, for guidance, but mom and Flag basically said that they ""weren't holding my hand"" which.. Not what I asked for nor wanted.

Back on topic. For a few months it would be like this. I'd go to grammas if I was feeling overwhelmed and needed time to relax. Sometimes she'd cover for me by saying she needed help with something or she wasn't feeling well and wanted me near so mom and Flag wouldn't get suspicious or something, I think they still did but it doesn't matter now. I remember a weight dropping from my back and shoulders each time I saw my gramma and walked through those doors. It was always warm and welcoming. Eventually I asked gramma ""If things got worse, would it be possible if I could move in?"" Because things weren't getting better between me and El, mind you we've been there alone without mom or Flag for like six months or so total (yes, they've been in Alaska that whole time, Flag takes temp. tour jobs there for about half the year if not a bit more and mom works remote so she can work wherever so long as she has internet) and we've just not been getting along. I always felt like walking on eggshells around him and it was making me feel sick.

She said ""I'm okay with it but you need to talk with your mom about it first."" So, I did. Mom and Flag and myself all had a video call, them telling me how awful it would be to live with gramma. How I'd be misgendered, dead named, worked near non-stop to keep the house clean, and more that I can't remember but those were the big ones.

Now, I am misgendered but not out of malice, it's because gramma is nearly 72 years old and she has trouble wrapping her head around me being non-binary. She can't get her head around the grammar due to how she was taught and also because she knew me as my \[birth sex\] for years. It boggles her mind a bit too much, but she tries for me because it's important to me. She does correct herself and apologizes but she struggles. She loves and supports me though and I can tell, I feel it. Hell, she paid for my name change! That was like $600 and months of waiting! She calls me by my new name, supported me when I froze and stammered in front of the judge cuz I was TERRIFIED (you have to tell a judge why you want to get a name change and I had never been to a court house before let alone stood in front of a judge.) She sat there in her wheelchair (she isn't paralyzed or anything like that she just can't stand for long and sometimes needs to sit down, somedays are better than others), gave a smile and nodded to give me support. She's helped me in more ways too aside from this, though I'll clarify in the comments if anyone is interested.

Sorry, back on topic. They tried everything to get me to not live with gramma and it worked for a while. I stayed there, stress building day by day until I actually began to dry heave and vomit from stress. Not a lot of vomit but a small bit. It started once a week and I brushed it off as me having drainage (I have high gag reflexes and sometimes when it gets cold some drainage hits my throat in a way that makes me gag or some thick saliva does the same thing) but then once a week became twice, three times, until it became once a day on average. My coworkers saw me run to the bathroom after I called for a replacement in room because I was getting sick.

I think it was that same day or near enough I went home after work, exhausted and passed out in bed. I slept hard only to wake up to my door being SLAMMED open and screaming from Flag about getting to the table for dinner. I told him I was tired, he said something to the extent of ""You work part time, you can't be exhausted!"" Mind you, I have to watch 20+ dogs by myself in one room, making sure none of them fight, none of them eat poop, keep an eye on C.A.D (crate at door) dogs when a new dog comes in(these dogs are door aggressive and must be put in a crate when a new dog comes in to keep a fight from breaking out and trust me, fights do happen and that's scary as hell), clean up pee, race poop eaters before they eat poop and more! While it was part time it was a DRAINING part time. those shifts were AWFUL! It was mentally AND physically draining. I loved the dogs don't get me wrong but the job... Never again.

I didn't have the mental fortitude to keep my cool so I snapped back a bit and he got louder, which made me shrink back. He kept yelling and I eventually saw mom come up and stand in the door way. I remember thinking ""Do something, please. Help me."" But she just stood there, watching. It clicked that that she wouldn't do anything, she wouldn't help me, she wouldn't stop him. Mom just watched.

I went to the table after dry heaving and washing my face, shaking, eyes bloodshot, sniffling, still overwhelmed and scared. I didn't eat, didn't say anything. Once everyone was done I went back to my room and felt more like I needed to get out. I couldn't be there because I could feel that I'd die or there would be major consequences of some kind. Either by my own hand or from the stress of walking on eggshells around both El and Flag. I didn't fully pull that trigger right away though, I should have but I didn't. I still wanted to try and get things to work because despite everything I still cared about mom.

Side note; A bit prior to this (or after this, I'm not super sure since this was in that fuzzy zone, sorry) we had a household meeting between myself, El, Flag, and Mom. I don't remember most of it but I remember this vividly, Flag yelled at me because he didn't want me to wear my noise canceling headphones when I vacuumed or did other chores because he ""Wanted to talk to \[me\] whenever \[he\] wanted"". I have sensory issues, certain things really overwhelm me. Mostly sounds but it can be other things too. Sounds like THE VACUUM, jet engines, lawnmowers, leaf blowers, the blender, static, multiple people talking at once in a crowded room, and so on. So I use sound canceling headphones to help deal/cope with moments. I also use them when I'm overwhelmed and need help decompressing. I'm also not a fan getting my hands wet while doing dishes (I remember him naming vacuuming and the dishes which is why I bring this up though I also wore my headphones while picking up dog poop and other chores, not all the time but it was often while doing chores that took a decent chunk of time). No, I haven't tried gloves since it's not the biggest thing by comparison and it's more manageable and honestly I just wanna vibe while doing chores cuz who doesn't? But he knew this, mom said he told him and I myself have explained this to him. Hell, we went to see the blue angels (military jet show thing on a military base), just me and him, and I told him I would have to bring my headphones cuz I knew the sound would get to me. And while the sound was muffled, I 100% needed higher grade ones than what I had on me, lesson learned. Ngl, cool experience though. That's to say, Flag was WELL IMFORMED about why I do it and the reasons connected to it. He had no excuse here. Similar things came up with El, but in more of ""why are you doing x?"" type of way but like... Snarky or disgust, text can only get across so much emotion. El says he's also on the spectrum so he should have an understanding at least vaguly but I'm well aware it's a spectrum and there are different flavors (I think mine's caramel vanilla or gooey butter cake, maybe caramel coffee?) of autism and all so it's a bit more nebulous with him. The main point here was Flag anyway but information is information, trying to paint the full picture as best as I can. Anyway!

This one I remember really vividly and is where time starts to focus back in, mid-late September of 2024. This is when my state has its state fair. I went up with mom, Flag, El, and El's girlfriend. We went in and split off into 2 groups. El and his GF went off to do whatever while I stayed with Flag and Mom. While looking over some dog treats I wanted to get for Bro-Bro and Lil-Man, Flag looked at me, smirked a bit and reached towards my stomach and scratched it just a bit (like, palm up and with all fingers and his thumb, kinda like scratching a dog's chin) and said something to the effect of ""You've been gainin' weight, huh?"" and I just looked at him with wide eyes, shocked and appalled he'd say that. If I were younger, a moment like that would have likely given me body issues or something. I do recall saying ""Yea, stress does that to you."" Under my breath but when he asked what I said I didn't repeat it. Worst of all, mom was near by, within ear shot.

A while after that I made up my mind. I went to gramma, begging her to let me move in, and she did. That took about a week to finish. Moving everything out and into my new room. I had help getting most stuff out, the only thing gramma couldn't help with was my dresser which Flag helped with. The bed stayed but most everything else was out.. After moving out I remember feeling so light and free, so relieved. I still kinda do but it's more grounded in reality and not like I'm walking on clouds. It still feels amazing.

Side note; Mom tried to force gramma to send me back, before I moved in mom told gramma that I couldn't come to live and gramma wasn't having it. When gramma tried to send me back (Mom threatened something but I don't remember what, probably no contact again) I paniced. ""Don't send me back. Please, I-I can't go back."" I was hyperventilating and couldn't. Gramma, thankfully, back pedaled with a quickness after seeing how serious it was. Ngl, when she said I had to go back, my heart dropped to my fucking toes.

After moving out things didn't stop. Mom would try to talk to me by sending little one off messages, which felt out of the ordinary because she wouldn't do that while on business trips way back before all this. She used to (And still does to my knowledge) travel a lot more and while on those trips I wouldn't hear much from her. She claims it was because I said ""I didn't miss her and didn't really think about it"" while she was gone but keep in mind I'm on the autism-spectrum and have adhd too so it was kind of like an out of sight out of mind thing, when mom was gone I didn't miss her cuz I didn't think on it. I was always happy when she came home but I guess that wasn't enough. This is to explain not excuse I swear!

She also didn't message me when I went away to pet sit for days if not weeks at a time. She'd occasionally send an update about Bro-Bro or Lil-Man but not much else so to be sent ""I love you"" or ""I miss you"" or similar messages just felt so weird. I was still keeping contact because I really wanted to work things out, I just couldn't do it while there.

This is where time gets a bit more clear and I'm able to look up messages so I'm able to be a LOT more accurate.

November 26th of 2024 at 7:11pm I sent mom a message asking if she was okay to spend my birthday with me either on or near my birthday, asking her about when it would be best to do so since I wanted to still show I was trying to mend things or at least keep things cordial. (I have many messages and I'm willing to show screenshots if asked and I'm actively looking at them now to get things right as best as I can but, though I don't wanna post them in the post since this is already really long and is not even done).

This is the message I sent verbatim (certain info redacted and some clarification on spelling); ""Just a quick question so I have clarity on the situation. Are you still planning on the birthday dinner to \[favorite sushi restaurant\]? If so will it be on my birthday, after, or before? I only ask so I can make sure other plans aren't impacted and any work plans on your end aren't impacted. I asked a bit ago, but I never got on \[an\] concrete reply.""

She messages me back on November 27th 2024 at 11: 57pm verbatim (Looking at the message, formatted exactly as she did);

""No.

I love you. But no.

I will always love you.""

Side note; My siblings both got either a well thought out gift from mom or something really expensive. Holly got a cake thing from her favorite fandom despite her sulking about stuff the whole day (there's a whole story as to why and it's not that big here just knowing that this was a thing is enough and I will admit, I was kind of an ass that day but I never knew it cuz it was the first time spending that day as her birthday so I didn't know it was her birthday, she had barely been living there a year and never told me) While El got one of his military friends flown out on mom's dime for a week. Mean while I got... Well you'll see. This is to preface I'm not just upset mom said this (though I really was upset cuz like... Come on) It's also cuz Holly and El both got thoughtful gifts from mom, one being super expensive, while mom didn't do much of anything for me, her first and only bio child.

I remember how excited I was when I got the notification that she replied, only for my heart to shatter to dust after reading that. I'm glad gramma wasn't home at the time cuz I wailed for the first time in years. The last time I cried like that was when one of my dogs (not mine in name but still) suddenly passed away, literally fine most of the day only to fall over by the side yard door, dying. (She was a Great Dane, one or two weeks from being 2 years old, and her heart was basically too big to properly pump blood at least I think. I miss how she gave me back problems from our cuddles. She stretch out her legs and give the biggest ""I'm to old for this"" sigh and relax, even though her legs are in your back. I'm serious when I say that I had to go to the chiropractor cuz of that dog. If I got the chance to bring her back at the expense of having said back pain... I'm not kidding when I say I'd take that deal. lol Rest well HQB, love and miss ya so much sweet bean. miss you all.)

My birthday that year was spent going to my favorite conveyor belt sushi restaurant followed by going to a drive in theater with the dogs to see Moana 2, both spent with gramma.

Side note; Gramma hates sea food (she ate something before sushi, though they had non-sushi/sea food options she also has severe celiac disease so she didn't wanna risk it) and hates driving at night so that was special to me. I will give mom this, she left me a $27 gift card for the sushi restaurant in the mail box. We both wore pajama onesies to the drive in, mine was stitch and hers was hello kitty. Lil-Man needed a sweater cuz he couldn't stand the cold cuz he's an old fart and has floating knee caps in his hind legs.

Back on topic! (Sorry for all the side notes, though I will not stop) Ever since then things just continued to slowly roll down hill. I distanced myself even more since I felt so unwanted, but still wanted to try and build our relationship back up. That's my mom after all. I only get one.

January 1st 2025, Mom and Flag got married in Australia right at midnight. She tried to call me to join via video call, I didn't attend. I didn't want to and I pretended I was asleep. By the way, Remember that date I said to remember earlier? Yea, this is why I said to remember it. The divorce was finalized not even a year prior. That's how fast mom moved. Though I guess that was apparent given prior information.

ANYWAY, after that she went from Australia to the Philippines quickly due to work suddenly needing her, arriving there on January 16 I think, while there things... Happened.

On Febuary 20 2025 at 5:33 am (cst, my time) mom sent me the following;

""I love you so much sweetheart. I am sorry I have not been the mom you needed.""

I replied. ""I love you too mom."" because gramma suggested I do. Later on I'd learn mom sent a similar text to gramma, instead changing ""mom"" to ""daughter""

I was later contacted by Flag that mom was in the ER, being admitted. She overdosed on Benadryl trying to commit suicide. Flag blamed us, saying we were ""--a big part of why this is happening--"" there was more to the message but that was the big part. Basically he blamed me and gramma for this happening, at least most of it. I hadn't been keeping contact with mom, slowly limiting more and more because things didn't feel right. I needed to heal, I needed my space, and not going to lie when I went without talking to mom for long periods of time I felt amazing but anytime she'd message me it would mess me up for at most a week and I'd fall into old habits. But I was still holding out hope that things would get better.

""That's my mom, she loves me, she'll come back, she always comes back, right?"" Is what I thought.. But in that moment, reading mom tried to kill herself with Benadryl I just felt numb in that moment. Eventually I felt bad, but it was because I felt numb not because mom tried to take her own life.

I later put the pieces together that I this wasn't her trying to die, but rather her seeking attention. I recalled the moment I nearly tried to take my own life, I planned on downing Benadryl cuz I wanted to go in my sleep cuz I'm not a fan of pain and kind of a coward but I managed to stop myself and confide in my mom and dad. I remember dad saying something like ""I'm glad you didn't, you would have needed to get your stomach pumped and that's not fun. It wouldn't have worked either."" to which mom said his name in shock/anger, smacking his gut with the back of her hand, not hard but enough to make a sound. I was around 14 or 15 at the time I think but had been battling depression on my own since I was about 12 or 13, eventually getting therapy when I was 16.

That aside, it took me a little bit to piece that together. Flag kept us updated on everything via group text between him, me, and gramma. Mom was having trouble sleeping and was having seizures in the hospital, she went for two days-ish without sleeping properly if at all. From what I can gather via those old texts, on Febuary 20 before 9pm mom got admitted into a room after spending hours in observation and getting an EEG and such. She and Flag were awake for 30 hours and Mom was jittery and at times incomprehensible, next day (Febuary 21st 2024) at about 4 am she finally falls asleep for about 5 hours, so about 2 days of no sleep. She eventually got released a few days later, after the 23rd(all that is Philippines time zone keep in mind).

I do want to add that mom did offer me to come up before she even attempted, on January 23rd but I declined. While it wasn't a big thing, the message says that Flag wouldn't, or implied that he was leaving soon given her message though it was kinda vague with no definitive dates so I'm not too sure, be there so that was likely a lie.

On March 9th mom sent old pictures of me and her at 7:58am saying ""Remember this?"" and I sent a lengthy message that I will summarize as basically me saying ""Yes I remember the past, back when I felt wanted. But now I don't feel that. I'm hurt and have been hurting for months, you saw my pain, you saw me get sick from stress yet you're not helping.

April 6th I blocked mom pretty much everywhere I could except facebook, where she actually blocked me. I don't use facebook so I didn't bother even looking there at first, only finding out later.

I've been living with gramma with pretty much no drama ever since. Even got in contact again with dad (he contacted me, gramma, El, and Holly cuz either mom or Flag, likely mom, sent him a message while in the Philippines around the same time she attempted suicide and he wanted to be sure I knew.)

I've since learned my dad isn't my bio dad even though he and mom said as such during their marriage. I would ask and mom would say ""No, he's your bio dad"" and we look and act alike so I didn't question. It's fine that he's not my bio dad, I choose and love him and he's so happy to have me, he cried when I called him dad again after years and I've seen his efforts. He's lost a LOT of weight, like 200 pounds or so and he's really healthy too. I'm so proud of his progress. I learned dad's side of things fairly quickly after we reconnected. Things might be a bit more garbled here since this is second hand information so bear with me.

After getting better from basically withering away dad went into a mental hospital, I saw him there at least once, and eventually moved into an apartment of his own. (He did invite me and Holly there to come visit and said something along the lines of ""If you see something feel free to clean up a bit"" but didn't mean it as ""come take care of me"" he meant it as ""Hey, if you see a mess it's okay to or not to clean it up I don't mind I just want you to visit"" but he miss worded it, which I think he shouldn't have said it at all and he thinks the same, Flag twisted this as dad wanting his kids to more or less be slaves which in the moment yea sounds like it but in hindsight given the context... eh it could've been worded better.).

Reaching character limit, will make a 2nd post and link it asap.

1qrgurd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1qrgurd/a_familiar_stranger/,A Familiar Stranger,"Like any other morning, I awoke to the bossa nova melody of my iPhone alarm tone at 6:45 a.m. I had always set it 30 minutes before my wife’s would go off so I had time for a quick shave and a shower. She would take over the bathroom at 7:15 a.m. and would be pissed if I messed with her morning schedule.

This morning, I rolled out of bed to notice she had already gotten up. Hmm, a little weird. I grabbed my house coat and strolled down the hall, expecting to see the bathroom door closed with her occupying it. Except, it wasn’t. I did, however, hear movement from down in the kitchen, so the mystery was solved.

I finished up my shower routine, dried off, and went back into the bedroom to get dressed for work. Normally, I’d wear a collared shirt and tie to the office, but the weather was cold and miserable, so I think a sweater would be fine with my navy dress pants.

I was pulling on socks when I heard what sounded like laughing from downstairs in the kitchen. It wouldn’t be unusual for my wife, Kathy, to be sitting at the kitchen table scrolling through Facebook memes and sipping her morning coffee, so hearing a laugh wasn’t really unusual. Except this laugh was a bit off. It sounded like her voice, but the cadence was different.

When you live with someone for over 20 years, their cries, shrieks, giggles, moans, and laughs are all very recognizable. This sounded like Kathy trying to imitate someone else’s laugh. Again, weird, but I shrugged it off, put on my watch and wedding band, and headed down the hall towards the stairs and the kitchen. I hated wearing rings, so I had a habit of removing them when I got home from work, or wherever else I’d gone, and then putting them back on again in the morning.

My wife wasn’t in the kitchen as I had expected, but I was more focused on grabbing a mug and filling it with the first of what would likely be a five-coffee day. Last night I had gone out with a few friends to watch the Bills game at Shoeless Joe’s, and it ended up being a later night than any of us had planned, considering we all had to work the next morning. I had crept into the dark bedroom at a little after 1 a.m. and, to my knowledge, successfully gotten under the covers without waking up Kathy. At least that was my assumption since I didn’t feel any movement on her side of the bed. She would normally head up to bed around 10:30 p.m. so I had imagined she was far away in dreamland at that point.

I was sipping my coffee at the kitchen table and scrolling through my work calendar when I could sense that unmistakable feeling of eyes on me. I looked back over my shoulder to see Kathy standing in the kitchen doorway staring at me. Her eyebrows were raised high, and her head was kind of tilted back in an uncomfortable position. A long frown pulling down her mouth in a way that made her face look almost unrecognizable.

Before I could react, my phone in my hand started ringing and scared the crap out of me. It was Marshall at work, and if he was calling, it probably wasn’t good. As suspected, shit was hitting the fan. I had to haul ass across town and into the office as quickly as traffic would allow. I chugged my coffee and looked back at the doorway towards Kathy, but she had already gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for work.

I grabbed my coat, yelled my goodbyes, and darted out to the car. No time to let it warm up, so the drive across town was a chilly one.

The first half of my day was consumed with angry phone calls from clients and team meetings. It wasn’t until around 11 a.m. that I was able to take a breath and head to the coffee station to take a quick 5. As I waited for the Keurig to do its thing, I looked down at my phone and noticed a missed call from Kathy.

I remembered how strange she had looked earlier that morning standing in the doorway, just staring at me with that glum expression stretched on her mouth. The odd way her head was cocked back and her eyebrows raised as if to be questioning something horrible I had done to her. I shuddered but then noticed she had left me a voicemail.

Was I frightened by her? This made no sense. We had spent the better part of our lives together. We didn’t keep secrets and we both knew all of each other’s habits. Even the annoying or gross ones. Soulmates, best friends, bla bla bla, you name it, we were that. But her face this morning was the mask of a stranger. Subtly that is, just like the laugh I heard from the bedroom. It was her but different.

My friend Artie had once taken a photo of me standing by the Las Vegas sign and used an AI app called Grok to make me appear to be doing a popular dance from the 90’s called The Running Man. It looked like me but wasn’t me. Something in the way I moved and smiled was creepy and wrong. I remembered laughing that day when he showed me but deep down inside I hated it. This is the best way I can describe how Kathy made me feel this morning.

I held my phone up to my ear to listen to the message she had left. I strained to hear what sounded mostly like the drone of a fan or some kind of white noise that dissolved into static. This went on for a good 10 seconds and I was about to hang up when I very faintly heard what sounded like Kathy crying…

Then nothing. The message just ended abruptly. I tried to call her back several times but it would always go straight to voicemail.

My mind was racing. There had to be a reasonable explanation for what was happening but the way my day was going, I didn’t have another second to contemplate it.

6 o’clock arrived in record time and as I was grabbing my jacket from the coat room I bumped into Jen who manned our front desk and spent most of her day forwarding phone calls to the sales staff.

“So did you and your wife have a lunch date or something today?” Excuse me I said, confused. Jen looked up at me while pulling on her winter boots.

“Well, I’m sure I saw her standing outside by the front windows looking in, and I guess I just assumed she was waiting for you.” “I got called to Marshall’s office, and she was gone when I got back, so I figured you guys had gone out for lunch.”

I looked at her puzzled. “No, we didn’t have lunch plans.”

Did we? I thought. Is it possible we made plans and I forgot? We’ve only met up for lunch a handful of times in the 11 years I’ve worked here, so I doubt that’s something I would have planned for and forgotten about… right?

The drive back home was a slow one due to the slippery road conditions, but I spent the entire time in a daze relaying the moments of the day back over and over again in my head. What was going on? Why had Kathy been standing outside of my office and didn’t even bother to come in and say hi? The way her face had looked this morning staring at me from the kitchen doorway. The way her laugh had sounded from downstairs and the odd voicemail she had left me. 

It was odd, right? Or was I just making something out of nothing? A lack of sleep and a few too many Stella’s the night before? Maybe, but I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t feeling a little bit apprehensive about walking through my front door knowing she was inside waiting for me.

I pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front door, and then quickly realized I had been wrong. I had been wrong about one thing anyways. She wasn’t inside waiting for me.

“Kathy”? I called out. My voice breaking through the silence as I stood inside the front entry of my home. The hallway in front of me stretched out into darkness and the faintly visible green carpet runner that led up to the second level. I reached out for the light switch, but even after the room was lit up, my unease remained. I called out Kathy’s name again but heard nothing. She was always home by 5:30 p.m. The silence was jarring.

Kathy would typically be in the kitchen preparing dinner by now, with a glass of wine and her dinner music playlist playing softly on the Echo speaker. The only sound now was my shoes padding on the stairs as I climbed up towards the bedroom. Another dimly lit hallway stretched out in front of me. The bathroom door mostly closed on my left-hand side, and the bedroom door hung open to my right.

“Kathy”? My voice cracked. I entered the dark bedroom, and my heart stopped. Someone was standing in the far corner of the room. What the hell was going on? Why was she doing this to me? Was this some kind of prank? That made no sense. Kathy had a sense of humour, but this wasn’t it. She would share jokes and cackle out loud at every episode of The Office, but she would never play a cruel prank like this. Would she?

I quickly turned on the light and let out a big sigh of relief when I realized the figure in the corner was just a dress hanging off the open door of Kathy’s armoire. “Jesus,” I said out loud and managed a bit of a laugh. The relief quickly dissipated though, as I still had no idea what the hell was going on.

I took off my ring and put it away, switched off the light, and walked towards the bathroom. Of course, she wasn’t in there, standing quietly in the dark, waiting for me to enter, but I don’t think I would have been surprised to find her there either. That was a crazy thought. This was my wife. Why was my heart pounding in my chest? I splashed water on my face and headed back down the stairs towards the kitchen.

The fluorescent lights lit up the room. The kitchen table stretched to my right just how I had left it, and the modest kitchen island to my left. There was something on the island. I had been in such a rush this morning I hadn’t noticed it. I walked up to the counter and picked up the note that contained my wife’s handwriting. A note she had left for me last night.

*John, I’m not sure what time you will be home from the bar tonight, but I have to go immediately.*

*I just received a call from my mom. Dad is in the hospital. He was in a serious car accident and is on life support. To make matters worse my cellphone slipped from my hand after I hung up with her, and I can no longer get it to work. I’m sorry I can’t wait for you to get back home. My Uber will be here to take me to the airport in 5 minutes. I won’t be able to call you until tomorrow night. I’ll explain everything and give you an update as soon as I can. Love, Kathy.*

I read the note over and over again. My hands were shaking as I stood there in disbelief.

Who was in the kitchen with me this morning? Who did I hear laughing? Who did Jen see standing outside our office staring inside?

A creak from the top of the stairs snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see two feet coming out of the darkness. Two feet that began descending down one methodical step at a time. The body and then face slowly came into view as the kitchen light barely lit up the bottom of the staircase. The mouth pulled down in a long grimace. Eyebrows raised high, head titled backwards unnaturally.

A laugh came out of Kathy’s mouth that wasn’t Kathy’s. I screamed and turned to bolt towards the back patio door, but couldn’t.

I could hear the sound of feet dragging across the hardwood floor behind me, moving at a slow but deliberate pace. I tried to move again but fear had me frozen in place. Tears started streaming down my face. I felt cold fingers running down the back of my head through my hair and tightening on my neck.

I fell to the cold kitchen floor and blacked out. When I awoke I opened my eyes to find myself still laying in the same spot I had passed out. The room was shrouded in darkness except for the green light of the digital clock on the stove. It told me it was 1:35 a.m. 

That was 3 months ago to the day. My wife had ended up staying for over 4 weeks at her parents house in Scotland while her father, thankfully, made a full recovery.

I never did tell Kathy about what had happened to me that day. What was the point? None of it made any sense so why would she believe me?

That was until about an hour ago when I was watching the local news, enjoying a beer after another long day at the office. There was a police officer standing at a podium addressing a crowd of news reporters. 

They had an update on the murders of 6 local men who had all been attacked and strangled in their homes. The murders had taken place over the last 8 months or so, the first body being found late June of last year. 

They had made an arrest, that was the reason for the press conference. A photo popped up in the right hand corner of the screen as the officer continued to address the media.

My mouth ran instantly dry. It was a woman. Her name was Helen Tanner. She looked exactly like my wife.",1,1769804537.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

I'm on a mission to overhaul my boring lifestyle in Oxford - should be a piece of cake!  



I'm looking to build deeper connections and have more meaningful experiences. I'm thinking about things like wellness/personal growth retreats and socialising that goes beyond just a coffee or pub chat.



I'm open to the usual fun activities like social sports, dance classes and such, but also want to explore my sexuality in a safe and conscious environement, without resorting to the mainstream dating apps.



I'm feeling ready for a new chapter but don't really know where to begin. I don't know anyone in Oxford who lives the kind of life I want to build. I'm looking for advice about specific local venues, events, communities where I could meet like-minded people. Any recommendations or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated! 🥂",3,1769804246.0,oxford,4,0.72,False
