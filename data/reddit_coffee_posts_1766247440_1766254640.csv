I’m 22F and recently graduated with a degree in International Business & French. I’m finishing up my last two weeks of full time night-shift work (did it for 2 years to get through college) and starting a proper 9–5 in January.

I’ve saved about €10k in the last 4 years (travelled the world and lived my life at a cost!!) but ideally I don’t want to touch this. I’m currently considering whether a small business loan would make more sense if I go ahead with anything. 

Long-term, I’m also studying independently to sit 4 actuarial exams next year, with the aim of changing careers end of 2026.  I expect to be earning more once these exams are completed and some, I’m not particularly keen on staying on €32k long term and would like to grow my money rather than just let it sit. A loan feels right even if im only predicting and not guaranteed to make more money once my exams are completed. 

My finances are grand, expenses to savings ratio is good as im living at home and my only expenses really are my car and personal funds for fun. 

The idea:
A small drive-by juice bar / café unit (permanent structure, not a stall) selling vitamin-filled & nutritious drinks, fun seasonal drinks, standard coffees, and a small range of pre-made bakery items.

what makes this idea successful in my opinion is the  location.

Why I like the location:
	•	Busy main road
	•	Surrounded by an HSE building, mental health hospital, MIDOC
	•	Large prison nearby
	•	Housing estates + heavy foot traffic (dog walkers, joggers, people walking to town)
	•	Limited nearby competition

I’ve done rough calculations on start-up costs, wages, and pricing. My pricing would be cheaper than competitors further away, and some drink ideas would be fairly unique to the area.

im concerned also because my father invested in a business that shut down within 3 months due to the current climate. im aware many cafes and restaurants have become victims to the current climate however, my predicted expenses would be nowhere near. 

Looking for honest feedback:
	•	Is taking out a business loan at 22 reckless or reasonable?
	•	Is €10k savings too little to be attempting this?
	•	Is now just a bad time for hospitality in general?
	•	Any obvious red flags I’m missing?

Happy to be told this is a bad idea. better now than later. Thanks!",1,1766254591.0,irishpersonalfinance,1,1.0,False

1prkt4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prkt4n,Sadettin Saran’s Statement has Emerged!,"Sadettin Saran said the following in his statement to the prosecutor’s office:

“It was a special wine that came to me from Croatia. That’s what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the wine that Ela and I drank that evening. I smoked a cigar that evening. Ela smoked a Vozol e-cigarette. She also drank a lot of the wine that night. From one bottle, I drank half a glass. Ela drank the rest. Ela’s message saying, ‘My head is still nice, what was that?’ is because she drank the whole wine.

‘But honestly, what HD dreams I had, and I fell asleep so thoughtlessly. It relaxes you unbelievably. It’s an amazing thing. Pick it from that garden and bring it to me next time. Yes, yes. Some really big names are taking heads, cutting people down. They sent Ms. Esra. Three days ago, Ms. Esra, for many years, was Didem Ciner’s right-hand person. She was in charge at Show. It’s not just removing people, anchors and so on they’re cutting heads off. Let’s see what will happen; we’ll wait and see, but there’s a design/plan. Please also fix things between me and Mr. Kenan, this is very important for me. I would be very happy if you do this,’

regarding that message: because I know that Kenan Tekdağ is a malicious and dangerous person, when Ela Rümeysa was moving from the TV100 channel to Show TV, I warned her. I told her Kenan is malicious, dangerous, and has dark connections. For that reason, she may have exchanged messages with Kenan Tekdağ.

In the message that says, ‘It’s an amazing thing pick it from that garden and bring it to me next time,’ likewise, it is a joke we developed between ourselves as a metaphor, based on lines from a film we watched. I absolutely cannot be involved with such a thing. In fact, I sent Ela Rümeysa a ‘get well soon’ message a few weeks ago after she was first taken into custody and then released. She replied to me with something like, ‘Believe me, I didn’t do anything like that.’ If we had used narcotics together, she wouldn’t have replied to me like that, or said ‘believe me.’ I replied, ‘I want to believe you.’

Ela’s message (in that form) is also the same as my defense above. These messages, as I said, are metaphorical jokes based on conversations in films we watched. The fact that we spoke so openly like this already shows it was a joke. If it were real, it wouldn’t be talked about so openly. I have only one addiction in this life, and that is sport. Only during the period when I had cancer, during my mother’s and father’s final illnesses and deaths, during the Fenerbahçe presidential elections, and during the period when I was slandered, I was given organic calming agents by many people. I used these as far as I can remember. I do not think they contained any narcotic active substance.

In my Istanbul home, in the room used as a guest room, the substance in a glass box, a jar with a lid that says GoStak, is not narcotic residue. In the glass jar were various medications belonging to my daughter. Most likely, the residue on the glass is the powder from these medications. In any case, it will be understood as a result of the examination.

As for the substances found during the search of my house in Assos: I called the housekeeper who works there and asked what these were. About 20 days ago, I hosted the women’s basketball team at my house in Assos. A lot of flies came into the garden. The housekeeper said she burned lavender or a similar plant/leaves to keep the flies away. Later, after we had a barbecue, she also burned coffee to drive away mosquitoes. The seized substances are residues from burning coffee, lavender, and sage.

As for my defense regarding the question of why the initial test on the substances showed a result indicating narcotics: the first test may have come back positive. However, we request that the forensic result be awaited. We host many guests at the villa in Assos. We hold large gatherings. More than a hundred people attend these gatherings. In fact, at my daughter’s wedding on August 21, more than 400 people attended. In any case, the places where these were found are not inside the house; they were found in the garden. If, at one of these gatherings or at a time when I was not there, someone else used something and discarded it, I have no knowledge of it. We request that fingerprint analysis be conducted on the substances found. I do not accept the accusations made against me.”",1,1766254453.0,FenerbahceSK,1,1.0,False

Problem is - I’m brand new to the company, I’ve only been here about a month and a half. And both he and I are very quiet reserved people. So even though we happen to work together almost every day for 8 hours, I hardly know anything about him. We just don’t talk a ton? It’s not awkward or anything, at least on my end, but we have kinda found a good flow of working together without saying a whole lot. Even though we close together 3-4 times a week and are usually the only two staff left by then lol.

\-

Here’s what I do know…

He has a girlfriend (who I think he lives with?)

He prefers to get meaty foods (burgers, stakes, etc) when he eats out 

He’s very concerned about his health and eats very healthily during lunch, primarily things like yogurt, fruit, vegetables, and nuts. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him drink soda or juice, but he does occasionally have coffee. He accepts sweet treats given to him by coworkers but come to think of it, I’m not sure if I’ve ever actually seen him eat them.

He is very orderly and tidy, like almost to the point where I question if he has OCD. Not in the quirky way but in the diagnosable affects their life kind of way. 

He gets queasy when he gets vaccines 

He works like 60+ hours a week

\-

He’s really kind and friendly, easy to talk to, happy to help people, respectful, all those things. He’s a good stand up person. I just don’t really know him super well so I’m not sure what to do about a gift. Since he seems so health conscious, my default of \*nice chocolates and something with them\* seems like it’ll fall flat. I know he’d be appreciative and not make it an issue, but I don’t want it to be a gift he dislikes still. ",3,1766254298.0,PharmacyTechnician,0,1.0,False

I will be in Portland with my partner to see John Mulaney at Moda Center on New Year’s Eve! We are super excited! I go to Portland a lot, but he has not done very much traveling in the last decade or so. We enjoy hiking (especially forested hiking), museums, record shopping, thrifting, antique malls, art house movies, and general random weird fun. We also love live music, especially cozy diy shows / house shows / more underground events. Open to all genres of music and types of art, love coffee, open to all types of food.

We don’t drink alcohol but we’re big stoners!

We’re staying close to Laurelhurst Park. We’ll have a car and are open to exploring different neighborhoods and also leaving the city limits. 

I’m looking for:

1. Recommendations for a place to have dinner within walking distance (up to 2 miles) of Moda Center for before the show on 12/31 

2. Anywhere cheap / free to celebrate the New Year’s countdown? Are there fireworks anywhere?

3. Recommended breakfast and dinner spots for New Year’s Day

4. Some fun activity ideas for New Year’s Day. What’s open New Year’s Day? I was thinking maybe breakfast, hike at Mt. Tabor, then something fun in the afternoon. I saw that the Science Museum will be open but not sure what else. We’re pretty open to anything cool you’d recommend.

I’m not a foodie. Heck, I can never even pretend to be a foodie, as I’m a vegetarian. This is just an experience that I wanted to share as an outsider to this wonderful city. 

For this experiment, I have excluded fast food chains such as McD, Taco Bell, Tim Hortons, etc. I’m also excluding clubbing places, given their main focus is not food (although, I had to include the horrible experience I had faced in one such place)

Absolute Favs:

The Big Chill - My comfort place. When I find myself bored, lazy or overwhelmed with options, I just choose Big Chill. The taste never disappoints and their variety! I’m a regular and yet, I’ve only tried 80% of the vegetarian menu. I love the courteous staff, the very 60s - 80s kinda music blaring, generally providing a very cheerful (and not necessarily overtly upbeat) vibe. 

Gulati - I can see the irony of reviewing this restaurant as a vegetarian. But this place made me understand and fall in love with North Cuisine. Never have I instantly fallen in love with a dish as I had with their veg galouti kebab!

Galaxy Pizza - Thin crusts with the right amount of flavour. While not a huge fan of their angry variants (it’s just extra added chillis), I just love their insane garlic breads and dips. 

Naivedyam - My go-to South Indian place. This probably is the closest that Gurgaon can get to to nailing proper South Indian food. Their garlic rasam rice has cured so many of my indigestion issues. 

Honourable mentions: Chicken Inn (veg galouti, again), Mahabelly (Parottas), Petite Pie Shop (Desserts), L’Opera (Madelines), Orange Twigs (best breakfast options). 

Moderate but trustworthy: United Coffee House,  Marietta, Shagun Sweets (Kachori), Ambani Coffee, Chelvies, Naturals Ice Cream, Mangle di Kulfi.  

Yet to try - Pizzeria De Suzy, Cocktails and Dreams, Bhawan 

Now coming to huge disappointments: 

Di Ghent’s - The very first restaurant I stepped into expecting a great English Breakfast. HATED it. 

Cafe Delhi Heights - I’ve given this place more chances than I would like to admit. I’ve visited the Ambience outlet, the Ardee one, and the Good Earth one (was just absolutely awful). Their breakfast was sad, their other cuisines suck ass, their fries are hollow and they diluted the shit out of my cocktails. 

Carnatic Cafe - How can you mess up thatte idli? How can you strip sambhar of all its taste? 

Bellagio - While I know bars and clubs serve finger food predominantly, it’s hard restrain from complaining if you cannot make the said finger food taste decent, even when the customer is mindlessly drunk. 

Other dishonourable mentions: SMOKEHOUSE (!!!), Chili’s (so unsanitary, saw a rat running around), Olly’s (again, a rat), Hamoni cafe, Havemore, Swagath (HATED IT), Como, Laidback cafe, almost all the other restaurants at 32nd and Worldmark.

I’m getting married soon in shā’ Allāh and would really appreciate advice from those who’ve been married or have insight into setting up a home with care and empathy. Since I have zero experience with women, I need all the advice and guidance I can get in shā’ Allāh.

My future wife is a shy person (Allahumma bārik), and I don’t want to overwhelm her with questions before marriage or make her feel pressured to articulate every preference. A lot of these questions can’t really be asked to a non mahram either. Since we’ll be moving into my apartment, I want to take the initiative to make it feel like our home—a place where she feels welcomed, comfortable, and genuinely valued from day one.

Apartment Setup & Décor

I already plan on doing a reasonable makeover-making the furniture, fixtures and textures more Scandinavian, but I’d love guidance on must-haves vs nice-to-haves.

Current plans:

    •	Giving her full use of the bedroom closet
    
    •	Improving the shelving and adding better lighting inside the closet
    
    •	Adding a study table in the bedroom
    
    •	Adding a dressing table (not sure if this is essential—advice welcome)
    
    •	Repainting a dark accent wall to an eggshell/off-white
    
    •	Upgrading light fixtures to something warmer and nicer

For the living room:

    •	I plan on getting a comfortable sectional and better lighting
    
    •	Should I buy a rug myself, or would it be better to leave that and pick one together so it becomes a bonding experience?
    
    •	Same question with plants—should I get some beforehand, or let her choose so she feels more ownership?

Bathroom & Toiletries

The bathroom is clean alhamdulillah, but the lighting and yellow walls aren’t very flattering, so I plan on upgrading it to make it more pleasant.

I’m unsure about toiletries:

    •	Should I stock shampoos, soaps, creams, etc. ahead of time, or would that come across as presumptive?
    
    •	Is it better to have basic, neutral options and let her bring or choose her own?
    
    •	If anyone has a comprehensive but reasonable list of women’s toiletries (no makeup—just skincare, haircare, body care), I’d really appreciate it.
    
    •	Should there be a second dresser for the bathroom or does a cabinet near the vanity suffice? Not all the female products can go in the bedroom dresser right?

Fragrances

I’d like to gift her perfumes as well. Please recommend solid, reliable, non-polarizing feminine fragrances from good brands—nothing too niche or experimental. Think “safe, pleasant, universally liked.”

First Night & Emotional Comfort

Her first night away from her family is something I’m especially mindful of. I want her to feel emotionally safe and at ease.

    •	What helps reduce anxiety or homesickness that first night?
    
    •	Are there small gestures, routines, or approaches that make a big difference?
    
    •	Since Islam doesn’t require immediate consummation, I want to prioritize emotional comfort and gentleness—any advice here would mean a lot.

Seating, Space & Interaction

This may sound overly analytical, but I’m genuinely curious:

    •	Is it better initially to sit with some physical distance (like across a coffee table) so she feels less exposed?
    
    •	Does having furniture or structure help someone feel more grounded and comfortable early on?
    
    •	Are there better ways to arrange the space to make it feel calm rather than overwhelming?

Warming Up & Bonding

    •	Do light activities help? (e.g., a simple game, tea/hot chocolate, a short walk)
    
    •	Are low-stakes interactions better than deep conversation right away?
    
    •	Any specific ideas that help ease nervousness and build comfort naturally?

Please feel free to share general advice or personal experiences (without explicit details). My intention is simply to be a good husband and provide a home and environment where my wife feels respected, safe, and cherished from the beginning, in shā’ Allāh.

1prkjvf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prkjvf,"Ex-Wife Moving > Wife Giving Birth? Congratulations, You’re Single Now","I'm taking three days off.""


I lay in bed, the C-section incision burning like fire.


""For what?""


My husband Charles didn't even glance at me, yanking his shoelaces tight. ""Vivian's moving. She needs help.""


Vivian. His EX-WIFE.


""I just had major surgery two weeks ago! Our baby is barely sleeping through the night!""


""My mom's here. You'll be fine.""


I tried to continue, but he'd already grabbed his car keys and headed for the door.


""I'll be back in three days.""


""Charles Miller!""


The door slammed shut.


My mother-in-law walked in with a mug of lactation tea. ""You know, Vivian's all alone now. You have me, you have the baby. Stop being so selfish.""


My hands clenched the sheets.


""Here."" She shoved the mug onto the nightstand. ""Just focus on your child. Stop complaining.""


I stared at her, then at the door.


""So I and our newborn come second to his ex-wife's moving day?""


I pushed myself up, ignoring the pain ripping through my abdomen.


""Then what the hell do I need him for? He can go be with her. I'm DONE!""


I stared at the mug of lactation tea. Hadn't touched it.


My mother-in-law had already retreated to the living room, TV blaring. The Maury Povich Show—her favorite.


The baby slept beside me, face still wrinkled and red. He's only fifteen days old.


My C-section incision hadn't even been cleared by the doctor yet.


Last night, the baby cried four times. I nursed four times. Charles slept through it all in the guest room—said he needed rest for work.


This morning, he got dressed like he was going to a business meeting. Said he was taking time off.


For a second, I thought he'd finally remembered—oh right, I have a wife who just had surgery and a newborn.


Nope. He was helping his EX-WIFE move.


Vivian. I'd been hearing that name for three years.


Before we got married, Charles said they ""ended things amicably."" No drama.


After we got married? Turns out ""no drama"" actually meant \*\*he's still in love with her.


Vivian's car broke down? Charles fixed it.


Vivian's laptop crashed? Charles drove over.


Vivian's lightbulb went out? Charles changed it.


Every time I said I wasn't feeling well, he'd say: ""She's a woman living alone. She has no one.""


I'd say: ""I'm a woman too.""


He'd say: ""You have my mom.""


I glanced toward the living room. My mother-in-law was eating fried chicken, laughing at the TV.


I picked up my phone. Opened Instagram. Charles's latest post from three days ago:


“Proud of my wife. Both mom and baby are safe. ?”


Photo: our baby's tiny foot.


I scrolled down. A month ago, he'd posted:


""Weekend vibes ☕""


Photo: two coffee cups. One black coffee. One latte.


We both drank lattes. The black coffee was for Vivian.


That day, I was home on bed rest. He said he was ""working late.""


Guess he just didn't want to be around his pregnant whale of a wife.


I put the phone down. Stared at the ceiling.


The baby started crying.


I tried to sit up. The incision ripped with pain.


""Mary!"" I called out my mother-in-law.


Nothing. The TV was too loud.


I bit down hard, slowly pushed myself upright, and lifted the baby to nurse.


Fifteen minutes later, the baby was asleep.


I was drenched in sweat. My incision felt... wet.


I looked down.


Blood. Blood was seeping through the bandage.


""Mary!"" I shouted louder this time.


She finally shuffled in, annoyed. ""What's all the yelling? You'll wake the baby.""


""I'm bleeding.""


She glanced at my stomach. ""It's just a little blood. You're overreacting. When I had Charles, I was up and walking by day three.""


""I had a C-section!""


""So? Women these days are so dramatic.""


She turned and left.


I lay there, tears sliding down my face.


Not from sadness. From pain.


My incision hurt. My chest hurt.


I grabbed my phone. Texted Charles:


> ""I'm bleeding from the incision.""


Read.


No reply.


I waited five minutes. Texted again:


> ""When are you coming home?""


Read.


No reply.


Twenty minutes passed. I typed again:


> ""Charles, I think I need to go to the ER.""


This time, he replied.


Three words:


> ""Ask my mom.""


My hands were shaking as I typed back:


> ""Your mom said I'm dramatic.""


Read.


No reply.


Fuck it! I threw the phone onto the bed. Closed my eyes.


The baby cried again.


I opened my eyes. Looked at his tiny, scrunched-up face.


Little one, you really picked a hell of a time to be born.


I slowly lifted him, my entire body trembling from the pain.


Chapter 2


4 PM. Charles still wasn't home.


I'd called him 99 times. 98 went to voicemail. One, he declined.


The 100th time, he finally picked up.


The background was loud, filled with laughter.


""What?""


""My incision is still bleeding. I need to go to the ER.""


""I TOLD you to ask my mom.""


""Your mom said it's nothing!""


""Then it's nothing.""


I gripped the phone tighter. ""Charles, I'm in fucking pain!""


""Vivian's place is a mess, I can't just—""


""I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT VIVIAN! I'M YOUR WIFE!""


The line went silent for a few seconds.


Then I heard her voice. Soft. Sugary sweet.


""Charles, where should I put this box?""


He covered the phone. Muffled: ""Bedroom.""


My stomach dropped.


""Charles."" My voice was ice. ""Are you in her bedroom right now?""


""I'm helping her move. Jesus Christ, Elena—""


""You're in your ex-wife's bedroom while I'm bleeding at home with your child?""


""DON'T START WITH ME!"" His voice exploded through the phone. ""I'm helping a friend! Why do you always have to make it about sex?!""


""I didn't say shit about sex! I asked where you were!""


""Your TONE says everything! You think I'm cheating? Seriously—""


""My TONE?! My TONE is the problem?! Not the fact that you're playing house with your ex while I'm literally \*\*falling apart\*\*?!""


""You're INSANE! I don't have time for this. Vivian can't move the furniture by herself.""


""And what about me?""


""You have my mom.""


He hung up.


I stared at the phone. My hands were shaking.


Mary walked in, carrying a bowl of soup.


""Stop screaming. You'll wake the baby.""


""Mary."" I looked at her. ""My incision is infected.""


""It's \*\*fine\*\*."" She set the soup down with a loud clank. ""Drink this. Sleep. You'll be fine.""


""I need to go to the hospital.""


""Hospital, hospital, HOSPITAL!"" She threw her hands up. ""Do you know how much an ER visit costs?! ""


""I don't care what it costs—""


""Well, I do! This family isn't made of money! You think we can just throw thousands of dollars away because you're a little uncomfortable?!""


""Uncomfortable?!"" I yanked the blanket off. ""LOOK AT IT!""


She glanced down. Her face twitched.


""It's... it's just a little red—""


""It's INFECTED! It's OOZING! Are you BLIND?!""


""Don't you DARE raise your voice at me!"" Mary's face flushed red. ""You know who didn't act like this? Vivian had a C-section too. She was up cooking by day three. Never whined!""


""You want to know why Vivian was so perfect?"" I leaned forward, ignoring the pain ripping through my abdomen. ""Because your son wasn't screwing someone else while she recovered.""


Mary's face went white. Then red. Then white again.


""I don't want to fight with you. Just rest, princess. Your drama can wait!""


She turned and left.


I leaned back against the headboard. Tears streamed down my face.


I didn't know what to say. Or who to say it to.


My parents were 500 miles away in Ohio.


My mom had wanted to come help. My mother-in-law said no—insisted she could ""handle it.""


My mom believed her.


I believed her.


Now I finally understood.


She didn't want to ""handle it."" She wanted to make sure my mom couldn't come.


I grabbed my phone. Texted my best friend, Sophia:


> ""Soph, can you come over? Please?""


> ""What's wrong?""


> ""My incision is bleeding. No one's helping me.""


> ""Where are you? I'm coming now!""


Twenty minutes later, Sophia arrived.


She took one look at my face and her expression darkened.


""Jesus, Elena. You look awful.""


She pulled back the blanket. Looked at my incision.


""Holy shit.""


Her face went pale.


""We're going to the ER. Now!""


She helped me stand. My mother-in-law jumped up from the couch.


""Where are you going?""


""Her incision is infected. She needs a doctor.""


She walked over, glanced at my stomach.


""Maybe it's not that bad...""


Sophia ignored her. Kept walking me toward the door.


""Wait—I'll call Charles—""


""Don't."" My voice was quiet. But clear.


""He's busy helping his ex-wife move.""


Chapter 3


The ER doctor looked at my incision. His face darkened.


""Why did you wait this long? This infection is severe. Another two days and you'd need surgery.""


Sophia squeezed my hand. ""Doctor, what do we do now?""


""Debridement. IV antibiotics. Immediately."" He looked at me. ""How many days postpartum?""


""Fifteen.""


""Has no one been taking care of you?""


I didn't answer.


The doctor sighed and started cleaning the wound.


The pain was excruciating. I bit down on my lip, tears streaming down my face.


Sophia stood beside me, her eyes red.


When he finished, the doctor said I needed to be admitted. At least three days.


Sophia helped me check in.


Lying in the hospital bed, I picked up my phone. Charles had texted.


> 7:32 PM:""Where are you?""


> 7:45 PM:""Why aren't you home?""


> 8:01 PM:""My mom said you left?""


> 8:15 PM:""Call me back.""


> 8:30 PM:""WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!""


I checked the time. 9:03 PM.


I replied:


> ""Hospital.""


Three seconds later, my phone rang.


""WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THE HOSPITAL?!""


""My incision got infected. I'm admitted.""


""What?!""


""Your mom said it was nothing. Turns out it was septic.""


......


""I... I'll come right now—""


""Don't bother.""


""What?""


""I said don't bother."" My voice was flat. Calm. ""Did you finish helping Vivian move?""


""Don't bring Vivian into this—""


""Your son is with your mom.""


I hung up. Turned off my phone.


Sophia sat beside me, holding out a water bottle. ""Babe, he's a piece of shit!""


I didn't take the water. Just stared at the ceiling.


""Soph, I need you to check something for me.""


""Check what?""


""Charles's bank statements. Last month.""


Sophia blinked. ""You have access?""


""Yeah.""


We'd set up a joint account when we got married. I had login credentials.


I sent her the info. She pulled out her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.


Five minutes later, her face went white.


""Soph?""


She turned the screen toward me.


I saw a transaction.


March 15th. $50,000 transferred.


Memo: ""Vivian—moving expenses.""


I stared at the number. My chest felt... empty.


When I was in labor, Charles said the hospital was too expensive. He made me switch from a private room to a shared ward.


We saved $3,000. He said we'd use it for the baby's formula.


Now I knew where the money went.


I scrolled up.


February 28th. $8,000 transferred.


Memo: ""Vivian—car insurance.""


February 14th. $2,000 transferred.


Memo: ""Vivian—birthday.""


January 30th. $12,000 transferred.


Memo: ""Vivian—rent.""


January 15th. $5,000 transferred.


Memo: ""Vivian—""


Sophia slammed the laptop shut. ""IS HE FUCKING MARRIED TO YOU OR HER?! “


I lay back on the bed.


""Soph. Take screenshots. All of these transactions.""


She did. Sent them to me.

1prkjar,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1prkjar/why_inflation_feels_higher_than_the_official/,Why Inflation Feels Higher Than the Official Numbers,"The latest CPI report shows inflation at around 2.7%, but many consumers feel like prices are skyrocketing—especially for items like beef, coffee, and fuel. This discrepancy isn’t just perception: the official numbers are weighted averages across a wide range of goods and regions, and they’re seasonally adjusted.

For example:
	• Beef and veal prices are up over 15% year-over-year
	• Instant coffee is up 25%
	• Fuel oil has risen 11%

Meanwhile, some goods have seen minimal price changes, but the products most people interact with daily may be among the fastest-rising.

This raises a few questions: How should policymakers and the public interpret inflation when some items spike far above the average? Are our experiences of price increases diverging too much from the headline numbers?

I’d love to hear from the community—how are you personally feeling the effects of inflation, and do you think the official stats tell the full story?",1,1766253755.0,economy,0,1.0,False

So have any of you tried Davidoff, how is it compared to Nescafé, and what's the best ""flavor"". 

Also little side note, wtf is Nescafé Gold and why does it look different than regular Nescafe. Like they both have the same ingredients I'm pretty sure. So like is the dehydration process different, what makes it ""Gold"".

1prkhc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1prkhc2/how_to_write_good_linkedin_posts_i_used_to_be_a/,How to write good LinkedIn posts (I used to be a journalist and now I'm a ghostwriter). I will not promote.,"I used to be a journalist at two major newspapers, so I use an approach informed by my newsroom experience.   
  
Now I ghostwrite for founders and VCs.

Here are my rules:

**1. Some industries do better than others.**

I have a client that's a fast-growing behavioral health company. A lot of their execs have lived experience with substance use disorder. When a Chief Growth Officer talks openly about their alcoholism, how it affected their professional life, and then connects that to business tactics, it resonates.

Compare that to a manufacturing company or a drywall company. Tougher to stop the scroll, unless you have frontline insights about tariffs or something else tied to the news cycle.

**Industries that are easier:**

\- AI startups that actually solve B2B issues  
\- B2B software that you can connect to larger issues (I do content for a title and escrow company but the founder can speak to using AI tools really well )  
\- Industries that have a strong human element (recovery, mental health, etc.)  
\- Coastal media (PR, journalism, ad creative, marketing)  
\- Fintech if you can make it sexy

**Industries that are hard:**

\- Pharma, biotech, hard med tech (a lot of these deals and a lot of these conversations happen behind closed doors, and it often takes years to run clinical studies. Not a lot of that marketing is ""out there."")  
\- Manufacturing and construction  
\- ""Boring"" B2B  
\- Service industries like restaurants, gyms, PT (use Instagram for that)

Caveat: I've had manufacturing execs go viral and get customers directly off LinkedIn, so it's not like this doesn't work outside those categories. It's just a lot harder.  
  
**2. Business in the front, party in the back.**

Your favorite publications employ this strategy and so should you.

Mix higher-engagement content (your journey, what you're seeing, things that are human but not oversharing) with tactical, useful business insight.  
  
Somewhat personal, but never full Facebook Confessional.  
  
Professional, but not a marketing brochure. What tactics can you bring to the table that would actually be useful for people in your industry? The key is showing not telling expertise. You're not doing a hard sell. You're just showing people you know what you're talking about. The best way to do that is to give them useful tactics that they could actually use.

**3. Be a reporter or a consultant.**

I take a very journalistic approach. Ask yourself what you're seeing in the rooms you're in that other people don't see. You're not giving away state secrets or recapping meetings blow-by-blow -- don't name names. But share real observations from inside your industry. If your customers or peers will let you name them --- and better yet tag them in the post -- even better.

Again, your favorite publications do this. If I'm reading about a major NBA trade for ESPN, I don't want to read a press release. I want to know what happened IN the room. How the conversation unfolded between the two GMs and where it happened.  
  
Specificity matters. The coffee shop, the Starbucks, the hallway moment where the deal actually shifted, and the Lakers convinced the Mavs to unload Luka Doncic.. That sense of immediacy matters on LinkedIn, too.  
  
**4. Figure out what your audience (and your audience's audience) cares about.**  
  
Create a Venn diagram in your head: what's interesting to you, what's interesting to other people, and what's good for your business. Play in the middle of that.

Say you're in PR and your ICP is former journalists turned marketers (or brands that care what journalists think). Talk about what journalists care about. Substack, media economics, holiday gift guides. What actually drives coverage. At the same time, talk about your personal journey as a founder. How you build, what you've learned. Career moments that overlap with what your audience already cares about.

There isn't really a hack for this. You get better by doing it, same way you'd talk to someone at a trade show. You don't open with a pitch because people can smell it immediately.

**5. Do an anxiety dump of raw thoughts.**

Pop in Airpods. Take the dog for a walk or do it at the gym. Start a new voice note, then just ramble about the above. Or, look at your Google calendar for the last two weeks and pick out interesting conversations you had. Take people inside the room.

Transcribe these raw thoughts with Otter or a similar tool.

**6. Use AI to form your first draft.**

I use AI heavily, but carefully. Once I have my anxiety dump of raw thoughts in transcription form, I put it into my AI tool of choice.  
  
I like Claude more than ChatGPT. I use WisprFlow now, too, to talk to Claude. I'm a writer and journalist by trade, but I do very little typing these days. I mostly talk, then edit.

Ask the AI to create a LinkedIn post in your voice specifically saying to use the words that you used, just cleaned up. No em-dashes, no emojis, no hashtags.

Watch out for overly clean sentence constructions. AI loves that. Humans don't talk like that. If the tool starts doing a caricature of you (smart business person but casual), people feel it immediately.

**7. Watch out for AI sentence constructions.**

There's an uncanny valley right now where even non-experts can tell when something sounds machine-made. You want the ideas to feel slightly messy. Not sloppy grammar, just human.

These are the most common AI sentence constructions I run into. I have a full prompt for this but you can include this in your prompt and ask the AI to never use these types of sentences

* **""If this, then that"" conditional structures**
   * Example: ""If you want X, then you need to do Y""
* **Rhetorical question hooks**
   * ""Do you want to know what I learned?"" or ""Want to hear something interesting?""
* **Rule of three patterns** (boom boom boom)
   * Three parallel sentences, three bullet points, three examples in a row
   * Example: ""This is X. This is Y. This is Z.""
   * Any pattern that groups things in threes repeatedly
* **Hyperbolic/declarative statements followed by a colon**
   * Example: ""In today's volatile business landscape, resilience isn't optional: it's imperative.""
* **Overly clean hooks or closers that wrap things in a perfect little bow**
   * Example: ""And that's how I figured out the key to life.""



**8. Edit your posts as a human**

Trust me, do a human edit.  
  
\- Take out any AI sentence constructions that the LLM missed  
\- Take out anything that doesn't sound like you  
\- Take out anything that sounds too polished  
\- Take out anything that crosses the uncanny value and leaves you with a feeling of mild discomfort

People can tell when something was written by AI and when you didn't want to spend enough time with the post.  
  
They feel like they're being served undercooked food. It leaves them with a bad taste in their mouth and hurts your brand.  
  
**9. Operationally, I like batching posts.**  
  
I have clients do idea dumps, I edit them in real time, then schedule manually on LinkedIn. I don't trust third-party schedulers, engagement pods, or automation because LinkedIn's terms change too often.

**10. Turn attention into pipeline**  
  
Once posts are live, I watch who's engaging, who's viewing profiles, who fits the ICP. I send connection requests for my own profile weekly.  
  
Outreach is manual and human, although I do have templates I start with. I'll never DM someone immediately after they connect. I want them to see my content first.  
  
**11. Your profile matters to the algo.**  
  
Headline. About section. LinkedIn's internal AI is reading all of it, and if your content doesn't align with who you say you are, it works against you. AKA don't post about crypto if you're building ag tech.

I like job title in the headline, a clear sentence about what you do or where you've been, social proof in the banner (logos help). I do have a Calendly link on my profile, but most inbound still comes through DMs. People don't really click that Calendly button.

Obviously, you want a good headshot and good banner. For the banner, displaying the logos of the brands you work with is ideal. Social proof matters.  
  
**12. Cadence-wise, posting twice a week works well.**

I think it's a good midpoint between having skin in the game and being a complete LinkedIn psycho. Sometimes I disappear for a bit. This is still social media and burnout is real.

**Final thoughts:**

My focus is organic content. I've spent years in a newsroom, so speed, editing, and clarity matter to me. I like producing content live on calls with clients because it collapses edit loops, gets them involved, and makes the process feel real.  
  
It took time to get good at producing multiple posts in a single hour, live. That part is just reps; there's no hack.

This is my first post in this group.

My doctor has had me try both trulance and Lubiprostone (linzess had some bad side effects so I can’t take that) and although they both helped me be more regular, I’ve realized that both medications spike my anxiety to an extreme degree.

1prkgj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1prkgj1/we_have_a_coffee_date_planned_for_tuesday_but_i/,"We have a coffee date planned for Tuesday, but I haven’t heard back from her in 15 hours. Should I follow up?","A few days ago I (34M) was donating plasma at a local clinic, and hit it off right away with the girl (29F) who hooked me up to the machine. She actually complimented my eyes first, then we chatted a bit over the next hour and things felt pretty good. Normally it’s my personal rule not to bother people at work, but for whatever reason something kept telling me I needed to ask this one out, so as I was finishing up I asked her if she’d like to get coffee and she ended up slipping me her # on a piece of paper. I hadn’t asked for anybody’s phone number in-person since like 2015 but it just felt right. 

That was Wednesday, and we’ve texted a bit since. We’re both busy, she has 2 jobs and I have a job & kid, so usually there’s been a 1-3 hour break between replies and I’m fine with that, I’m not a huge fan of texting anyways. We’ve sent 83 total messages back and forth. 

We’ve made plans to go for coffee after she finishes work on Tuesday, (tentatively?) confirmed as of last night. But over the course of yesterday afternoon until now, things have slowed down. Yesterday we were talking back and forth all day until 4pm, then I didn’t hear from her again until 9:30pm. No big deal I thought, she had work and then a dinner after work, and on top of that the roads were messy, so I didn’t think much of it. I was actually in the process of typing to ask about the coffee date as she finally responded, she apologized for taking so long and she told me Tuesday works best, then “heart-reacted” my response where I said Tuesday would work for me. 

She ended up sending me one more short text right before 10pm, which I answered about 30 mins later. But now it’s been almost 15 hours since my last messages and I haven’t heard from her. Both of the last 2 mornings I heard from her right around 8am, so I’m getting slightly confused and concerned.

I actually have another appointment to donate plasma on Monday, so as of right now my plan is to leave it alone and maybe I’ll see her at work that day, and if I do, I would try to ask her then if she’s still down for coffee the next day. 

But part of me is also thinking that sending her a follow-up message later today wouldn’t hurt, while another part of me is telling me that all it would do is make me look desperate or needy. 

I haven’t dated much since my kid was born in 2017, just a few flings (one slightly more serious) a couple years ago, so appreciate any advice you guys can offer to talk me off the ledge! Thank you 🙏🏼 ",1,1766253575.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

***DISCLAIMER***: I've came up with those before I've read the Kitchen spin-off, so some of HCs may be VERY different from canon

Well... let's start!!

*Qifrey* doesn't like sweets in general. He prefers both his tea and coffee sugarless and his maximum is bitter chocolate. 
Though, if girls prepared something tasty (not only sweet, but in general), he would try it everytime and praise them, but after that he'd say that he's not hungry and they better eat it themselves or offer some for Olly.

*Olruggio*, compared to Qifrey, has a sweet tooth. Though, everytime they all eat something sweet he tries to make it look like he's being forced to eat it, and just act like ""I don't like sweets, bye"".
As the result he finishes his sweets first and after that just sits there sipping on his tea, while everyone else are enjoying their part.
He likes homemade pastry and custard cakes (is that how they called in English?? 😭 anyway, they're right on the picture)

*Coco* likes caramel and I don't think that I even need to explain that. But, y'know, not those regular caramels, but homemade ones (basically sugar melted on fire).
Also she likes white milk chocolate and cherry cakes covered in white frosting (I don't know what they're called, but I liked them as a child) and maybe some marshmallow 

*Agott* likes bitter chocolate and something that's not too sweet in general. (She's fighting with Qifrey for the last bar of the bitter chocolate /j).
Likes having tea with chocolate  chip cookies or desserts with blackberry, especially muffins.
Idk why, but I think that in modern!au she would like strawberry/blackberry flavored mochi

*Tetia* likes caramel. Just, CARAMEL. If she could she'd eat only them. She also likes homemade marmalade and jellies. And she likes those, uhm... similar to caramel thingies called pencils?? Idk if you've ever heard about them, but they've had different flavors too, and I bet that her favorite is apple flavored one.
In modern!au Agott introduced her to Japanese sweets and now mitarashi dango added to her list of favorites

*Richeh* eats everything that's somehow connected to coconut. Bounty, those bears in coconut flakes, raffaello and just coconut flakes. She likes sour jellies (sharks are her favorites) and butterscotch despite claiming that they're too sweet for her",7,1766253314.0,WitchHatAtelier,0,1.0,False

Ao meu ver, a torra está bem média, nada de clara, muito irregular, graos irregulares também, precisei ficar catando quackers. Pra um café que é vendido a 75 reais no site (paguei 59 na CC) esperava bem mais. Preparei uma segunda receita, com água a 84C num origami e a bebida ficou ok mas esperava algo realmente incrível.

She actually complimented my eyes first, then we chatted a bit over the next hour and things felt pretty good. Normally it’s my personal rule not to bother people at work, but for whatever reason something kept telling me I needed to ask this one out, so as I was finishing up I asked her if she’d like to get coffee and she ended up slipping me her # on a piece of paper. I hadn’t asked for anybody’s phone number in-person since like 2015 but it just felt right. 

That was Wednesday, and we’ve texted a bit since. We’re both busy, she has 2 jobs and I have a job & kid, so usually there’s been a 1-3 hour break between replies and I’m fine with that, I’m not a huge fan of texting anyways. We’ve sent 83 total messages back and forth. 

We’ve made plans to go for coffee after she finishes work on Tuesday, (tentatively?) confirmed as of last night. But over the course of yesterday afternoon until now, things have slowed down. Yesterday we were talking back and forth all day until 4pm, then I didn’t hear from her again until 9:30pm. No big deal I thought, she had work and then a dinner after work, and on top of that the roads were messy, so I didn’t think much of it. I was actually in the process of typing to ask about the coffee date as she finally responded, she apologized for taking so long and she told me Tuesday works best, then “heart-reacted” my response where I said Tuesday would work for me. 

She ended up sending me one more short text right before 10pm, which I answered about 30 mins later. But now it’s been almost 15 hours since my last messages and I haven’t heard from her. Both of the last 2 mornings I heard from her right around 8am, so I’m getting slightly confused and concerned.

I actually have another appointment to donate plasma on Monday, so as of right now my plan is to leave it alone and maybe I’ll see her at work that day, and if I do, I would try to ask her then if she’s still down for coffee the next day. 

But part of me is also thinking that sending her a follow-up message later today wouldn’t hurt, while another part of me is telling me that all it would do is make me look desperate or needy. 

I haven’t dated much since my kid was born in 2017, just a few flings (one slightly more serious) a couple years ago, so appreciate any advice you guys can offer to talk me off the ledge! Thank you 🙏🏼 ",1,1766253098.0,datingadviceformen,2,1.0,False

It's pretty straightforward and exactly as it sounds - you bring a record and share a little about it. Everyone gets 1 side/20 mins max and if there's extra time at the end of everyone's turn we can share more. 

There's lots of different themes available, like our fav album of the year, Halloween, Christmas, or genres of course. We always tried to leave it completely open as to not hinder anyone's choices! It's about sharing and learning about new music after all! 

It's a great way to meet new people that doesn't involve drinking (although some people do bring their own drinks) or spending money, and nice way to spend an afternoon, especially in the long, dark, winters ❄️ where you can spend some time with a nice hot coffee ☕ or chocolate listening to records with cool people 🤗

This guide shows you how to blend creamy, satisfying drinks that keep carbs low, favor healthy fats, and fit a ketogenic lifestyle — without tasting like diet chalk. Ketosis is the metabolic state produced by a very-low-carb, higher-fat eating pattern, and properly built drinks can be a simple way to meet your macros while staying full and focused.

**Who this guide serves:** beginners who need clear, practical rules; busy people who want fast, make-ahead keto breakfasts and on-the-go shakes; and women 50+ who often want recipes tailored for appetite control, bone and heart health, and changing energy needs. Because older adults may have different cardiovascular and medication considerations, I’ll flag when a recipe or ingredient warrants extra caution or a quick chat with your clinician.

**What you’ll get here:** a short, non-judgy primer on keto drink building blocks (bases, fats, proteins, sweeteners), macro-friendly recipes (from quick coffee boosts to meal-replacement smoothies), make-ahead and freezer tips, shopping lists, and plain-English safety notes so you can decide what works for your goals. Practical, evidence-aware pointers are woven through the recipes so you can blend confidently — whether you’re trying keto for weight, blood-sugar control, or just better morning energy.

My friend grew up quite obese and wears the scars of that experience. The last 4 years, she lost a ton of weight and I can see how much confidence it brings her! Unfortunately she lost the weight rapidly because of depression. Regardless, I see how it benefits her.

I am currently visiting her and I’ve noticed that she speaks about weight 10-15 times a day. And not in a healthy way. She’ll wake up, head straight to the mirror, stare at her body and say “skinnyyyyyy”, and say “big” to others who express interest in eating food. For example, I said I wanted breakfast in the morning instead of just a coffee and she was like “bigggg” but apparently as a joke.

I wanted to get a takeaway one night and she said, “do you want the takeaway or to be skinny?”, and for me, I’ve definitely put on weight but I’m okay with my body in age. I feel so entrapped in her hyperfixation with weight and it makes me uncomfortable.

She said someone at work told her she lost weight and that she should keep going. And she was like let’s see! I pointed out immediately that that’s inappropriate, people shouldn’t dictate how she sees her body. She also said she finds larger people disgusting. It feels like self hatred, wdyt?

One day I got a message from her to know whether I got the call or not; for context, she got my number on day three along with others to complete her survey. It was for genuine work.

I noticed she had a cold, so I asked about her health because she did that for me. I offered to make a tea because of her cold. She said, “We will do one day outside”. Later after the message, I ask why you are messaging after rejecting me. She said, ""She didn't mean it; she doesn't know how she can go for a coffee.""

Made me groggy and cranky before I even had my coffee. Got tired of it and started digging into why mornings can suck so much. Found out that getting jolted awake spikes your stress hormones, but if you ease out of sleep gently, it’s way better for your system

So I built a simple app around that idea. No jarring beeps, just peaceful gentle sounds like birds, a calm forest, or mellow music that fade in super slow. No magic bullet, just a way smoother start to the day that actually worked for me

Happy weekend….43, married and getting ready to battle the shops today!!!

Lil about me….by day, I’m loving a career that keeps the lights on and the tasty coffee flowing each morning…. By night, and definitely on weekends, I am being humbled by my kids, who remind me daily that I am not as cool as I think I am.

Weekends look like cozy clothes, a golden retriever with a personal vendetta against my socks, and a peaceful, creamy coffee moment that lasts exactly until pancakes are demanded. Stacks of em….

I believe in balance: staying active enough to justify seasonal cookie overconsumption. That means the occasional workout, some running, and a lot of chasing my floof around the yard like it’s an Olympic sport.

Current life highlights include….

Coffee with Standards: Creamy, festive, and absolutely judging you if you drink it black (kidding kidding)

Snack Sophistication: I build a mean charcuterie board and only sometimes eat half of it mid-assembly.

Fearless Cooking: Bold flavors, zero recipes, and a lifelong goal of hearing “Dad, this actually slaps.”

Big music lover: Think Blink-182 attitude, Bon Jovi rocking , and a little folksy rock for emotional depth during carpool karaoke.

Looking for a Plus-One for Cozy Winter Days,"It’s been too long since I’ve had the kind of night where conversation flows, laughter feels easy, and you walk home with that warm, fuzzy feeling. Let’s Have a Genuinely Good Time

We could grab coffee at a quiet bar, wander through a museum, stay up too late talking about the strange corners of life… or just chill in home with blankets, Netflix, and a little bit of stolen warmth.  

If the chemistry is there, maybe it turns into something more, slow, natural, unforced. I’m not shy about wanting intimacy, but I think the journey to it is just as fun as the destination.  

### *About me*

- 26, fit, clean, 6’0"", 65 kg, beard & glasses (non-native)  
- Friends would say I've a calm voice, empathetic, alternating between hopeless romantic to romantic rebellion. 
- Uni, work, gym, repeat, but making time for what actually matters  
- Rarely smoke, 420-friendly, overall pretty chill & open-minded. 

### What I’m hoping for

A genuine, easygoing connection with someone who’s open-minded and kind. You take care of yourself, and feel comfortable expressing what you want without pressure or games. I prefer starting meeting in person after talking for awhile, seeing how the energy feels, and letting things develop naturally if the chemistry is there.

**Age range** 

– I care more about chemistry than numbers; attraction doesn’t follow a strict age rule (18+). 
 
**My promise** 

– just two people meeting with good intentions. No expectations, no awkwardness, no obligations. Comfort and mutual respect come first.

Anyways If you’re in the mood for a connection that can be coffee, cuddles, or something a little more electric…  
then maybe we should meet like two old friends who just haven’t met yet :)

My partner has divorced parents, so growing up he spent Eve with his dad and Day with his mom. We spent our daughters first year with eve at his dads then leaving to spend the night at moms for the day. Her second Christmas we went up to my parents.

I’m from the Philippines. It’s been years since I put myself out there and I’m looking for someone to talk to and see how it goes from there.

**About me:**

\- 5’3”, caramel skin tone, curly hair.

\- A bit on the thick side: soft belly, thighs you can sink your teeth into, and a nice booty. I’m currently on a fitness journey and picking up working out regularly again.

\- I love watching movies and shows, plus yapping about them! We can watch stuff over Discord, Rave, or Netflix Party.

\- A little bit of a nerd! I love the LOTR movies + appendices, DC comics, anime & manga, literally anything by Guillermo del Toro, and some of my comfort shows are Community, Scrubs, Modern Family, and Brooklyn Nine Nine.

\- I could get pretty silly and funny, we’ll play it by ear—maybe our humor would match. Send me memes, or links to stuff you find funny. I’m generally easygoing and will try to make a conversation work but please bring something to the table 😭

\- I love cats! I rescue and foster strays, and used to volunteer for a non-profit organization feeding strays.

\- I have creative hobbies: photography, drawing, crocheting, writing.

\- I have a Nintendo Switch so if there are games you want us to play and bond over, we can do that!

\- Can do calls but need to be comfy with you first. Can do LDR.

\- I have a stable career so you don’t have to worry about me.

**What I’m looking for:**

\- Someone who sees a future in the Philippines and is already open to moving here

(I don’t want to sell you on the culture, weather, or vibe—if you’re curious, I can be your tour guide 😉)

\- Rooted, stable, emotionally available, and serious about building a future

\- Family-oriented and looking to start one in the near future

\- Good chemistry—yes, attraction matters. Bonus points if you’re tall. You don’t have to be jacked, just someone I can hit the gym with

\- A good conversationalist. Tell me stories. Tell me what you’re passionate about. Let’s talk until we’re both smiling at our phones like idiots.

**So, if this sounds like your cup of coffee…**

Slide into my DMs and put some effort in.

Tell me about yourself—your age, location, and send a selfie you feel good about. I’ll send mine too, and we’ll see if the vibes are mutual.

Please be a gentleman.

I (26F) work at a gas station. I started working there about 8 months ago and my coworker May (60sF) started working there a couple of months after I did. I work night shift and after a few weeks of her working there our manager started putting us together on night shift. When May first started working there I was nice to her and would occasionally help her figure stuff out because she was still kinda new and didn't know how to do everything. As far as I knew we got along well

One day our manager pulled me aside and asked me if I was actually helping other coworkers with chores during night shift. Because apparently according to May when we work together all I do is stand behind the counter and do nothing while she does everything. Our assistant manager confirmed to me that it was her who told our manager that. But even before she confirmed that it was May I already knew because before I started working with her I worked with 4 other people on night shift and never had an issue and the amount of work that I do had never been questioned until I started working with her

I didn't say anything and just left it alone. There's a cute guy that comes into our store and gets ice all the time and he has a crush on me everyone knows about him including May. A couple of days after our manager confronted me he came in and started talking to me. May interrupted our conversation and said ""Oh you should come in everyday because you're the only one who can make her wake up and do something"". He just gave her a weird look and ignored her and went to get his ice. Even as he was ignoring her she kept trying to talk shit about me to him

After that I decided to keep my distance and not talk to her unless absolutely necessary. The next time I came into work I wasn't there any longer than about 45 minutes and most of that time I was doing work outside while she was working inside. When I came back inside I answered a question for a customer that she was ringing up and she got upset and said ""Oh so you can talk to her but you can't talk to me?"" and stormed off to the back

After that I found out that quite a few of our other coworkers don't like her including our assistant manager because she likes to micromanage people and act like she's the one in charge and boss people around. She even tried to get another one of our coworkers in trouble for leaning on the counter while taking a break from cleaning. She's also been rude to a few customers even refusing to give one of our regulars a bag and telling him ""You should've kept the bag we gave you last time"". Also the reason why she lied on me to our manager is because she was mad because I wouldn't ""do as she said"". She wanted me to rush a customer out of the bathroom so that another customer could use it and not have to wait and she wanted me to show another customer how to use our coffee machine. I ended up making a video venting about the things that she did and how frustrating she was to work with and posting it on social media. My assistant manager saw it and didn't say anything and actually thought it was funny (this was about 3 months ago)

Earlier my coworker Tay (50sF) (who also doesn't like her) told me that a couple of days ago one of our regulars found my video and showed it to May and now she's upset and complaining to corporate about it. I told her that I don't care and she can be as upset as she wants because she shouldn't have started shit with me and lied on me to our manager. Especially when she breaks rules all the time like accepting packages that aren't addressed to us even though our district manager came in and told her not to or letting people use the bathrooms after they're supposed to be closed. Tay said that what I did was technically breaking the rules too and that I should've tried talking to her instead because some people don't like it when you run to the Internet

I said that there was no talking because she knew exactly what she was doing and tried to get me in trouble with our manager for basically no reason and when that didn't work she tried to embarrass me in front of the cute customer all because I wouldn't let her boss me around and even after that she was doing little petty and annoying things like purposely writing her numbers in my clearly marked column on the paperwork and interrupting me while I'm talking to customers and pretending like she doesn't know how to do basic simple tasks. She even got an attitude because I signed off on a repair when our managers weren't there even though the guy asked her first and she didn't want to and told him to ask me instead. Besides I didn't say what location she worked at and I wasn't wearing anything from work in my video and I did it during my personal time not work hours. So if someone put the pieces together and figured out it was her that's not on me

I honestly don't think corporate is going to do anything since no one's reached out to me and if it really was an issue our assistant manager would've said something when she saw it. But honestly AITAH?",0,1766252125.0,TwoHotTakes,3,0.33,False

But while you’re doom-scrolling, the data shows that **smart businesses are quietly shifting gears** and leaving the ""business as usual"" crowd in the dust.

The analysis is in: **43% of businesses are making moderate to significant changes** to their marketing approach. Because apparently, ""praying for the best"" isn't a viable fiscal strategy for 2025.

**THE AGILITY GAP: AI vs. The ""Wait and See"" Crowd**

There is a massive divide forming between the businesses that use tech and the ones that just use their ""gut feeling.""

* **The Global Shift:** **16.7% of businesses** are significantly shifting to prioritize domestic markets and suppliers. (Basically, ""local"" is the new ""global"" because shipping a container now costs as much as a small island).
* **The AI Advantage:** That percentage jumps to **24.3% among AI-savvy businesses.** \* **The Takeaway:** If you have AI, you're apparently more agile. If you don't, you're stuck in the mud wondering why your supply chain looks like a disaster movie.

**THE TRINITY OF ECONOMIC TERROR**

Why is everyone changing their budget? It’s not just the headlines. It’s the three horsemen of the small business apocalypse:

1. **Inflation (39.0%)**: Because who doesn't love paying more for less?
2. **Shifting Spending Patterns (27.7%)**: Your customers are suddenly realizing that ""essentials"" don't include your luxury scented candles.
3. **Supply Chain Disruptions (17.6%)**: The ""Is it on the boat yet?"" game that nobody wins.

**""MARKETING SMARTER"" (Or Just Less Clumsily)**

* **The Laggards:** Are doubling down on Facebook because they're scared of anything new. They're basically trying to fix a leaking ship with more water.
* **The Leaders:** Are moving toward **precision, measurability, and flexibility.** That means personalized email and video that can be pivoted in five minutes when the next tariff tweet drops.

While everyone else is freaking out about the macro-economy, the winners are focusing on the micro-controllables. They’re dumping the ""spray and pray"" social strategies for precision tools that actually work when the world gets weird.

For as long as I've been alive I've either ""not dreamt"" (forgotten immediately on awakening) or been subjected to these BS stress-dreams.  Here are a couple examples:   
   
I dreamt I was in highschool and there was this girl I liked.  She asked me to get us some coffees and I went and did, all excited.  When I returned there was only another person saying, ""They're dead,"" and holding out two cut zip-tie wedding rings as from a terrible teenage romance ended in ""jumping off the bridge"".  She lied to me to get me out of her hair to be with her boyfriend, to maybe the worst ends possible.   
   
The other night I dreamt my household was being terrorized by this fridge of a Caucasian guy with round glasses.  He stalked all around the outside and at one point I plucked up my courage and confronted him directly on the other side of the window: I said, ""This is a bit silly, isn't it?!?""  A little later he appeared inside the house and I stabbed him in the chest with a big leather awl.  That appeared to be enough, but I got him a bunch more times as I didn't want him to suffer.  When I was done he disintegrated into something like black cotton.   
   
I'm not really looking for anyone to parse these particular dreams for me.  The consistent elements are stress, responsibility and frustration and occasionally it ruins my morning.  I wake up agitated, not rested and Mark Wahlberging like crazy (huh? wuh? how?), then I forget what happened and only the nervous detritus is left.  I was introduced to one of my helper spirits in a dream (one of maybe two dreams I've ever had that made total sense) so I'm curious why the rest of it is a salad of stressful nonsense.

A guy (30M) who I dated for a month or so around two years ago recently reached out to me. We ended up meeting for coffee around a week ago and then spent the day together a couple of days after that. I enjoyed myself but did notice that he spent a lot of time talking about himself. For example, I’m doing a college course at the moment and he didn’t ask what I was studying or what my future plans were. 

However, he came across as interested and was texting me all throughout the day, wanting to see me again etc. I kind of got bored though on Thursday when I’d had enough of the texts being all about him, him not even asking how I was or how my day was or anything like that. So when he told me about some plans he had for the day with his friend, I replied with ‘cool cool’. 

I haven’t heard from him since and he hasn’t even opened the message. Now I’m wondering if I should reach out as I think maybe I was a bit rude/blunt. It seems odd as he was messaging me so consistently before. 

The reason things didn’t work out between us before was because he wasn’t sure what he wanted at that time and was having some health issues. He also made a cruel joke to me at that time which I took to heart and that kind of put the nail in the coffin for me. But I do like spending time with him.

1prjq4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Somethingwittycool/comments/1prjq4l/the_monday_man/,The Monday Man,"In Peoria, Illinois, there resides a strange fellow the locals call “the Monday Man.” He lives in a small blue house with yellow trim, a dark brown door, and a front porch surrounded by white painted wood railings that have seen better days. Once dismissed as a crazy recluse, he is now considered an irreplaceable legend. 


For over thirty years, every single day, a man wearing a thinning but clean yellow robe, green plaid pajama pants, and off-white slippers steps out of his front door at 9:15 in the morning. Holding a steaming cup of what is assumed to be coffee, he gently smiles, leans on the side of his front door frame, its paint slightly rubbed off from this daily habit, and raises his blue cup to everyone that crosses his path.


And he always says the words, and only these words: 


“Mondays, am I right?” 


He says it with a kind gleam in his eyes to every jogger, neighbor heading to work, college student taking a shortcut, and kid heading to a friend’s house. No matter their gender, status, or where they are going, he does not discriminate. Somehow, those words transform into whatever that individual needs to hear, and his voice warms them like a gentle hug.


Blue mug in hand, regardless of the day, month, or year. No matter the weather. 


“Mondays, am I right?” 


The brief period between 9:15 and 9:45 in the morning is the only time he is ever seen. The public has accepted that the man with the kind eyes and bright blue coffee cup will never join them on their walks.


There is one person in particular who has found greater meaning in the Monday Man’s strange routine: a recently retired postal worker named Tom Whitaker, age seventy-two.


“It’s comforting, in a way,” Whitaker told his next-door neighbor, standing next to his beige Ford Taurus, gazing thoughtfully at nothing. “You can count on the Monday Man. Like the sun rising and setting. He’ll be there.”


Whitaker spent forty years working through snow, rain, blistering heat, sunshine, and cloudy days, never missing a day of thankless work. When he retired, he tried to find new hobbies. It was difficult, with bad knees, shaky hands, and cloudy vision. But the Monday Man’s daily routine has given him something to look forward to and take comfort in.


“It’s like how I was at my old postal job. Routine. It makes me smile. Every morning, without fail. Rain, snow, global pandemics, the Monday Man’s got that mug. Sometimes I like to think, because he always calls whatever day of the week it is, the most difficult weekday for most people... it’s like he’s carrying the weight of all our Mondays, all our worries, on his shoulders. I think maybe that’s what he’s trying to say. Does that make sense?”


His neighbor nodded again, smiled, and said goodnight, leaving him with his thoughts.


The next day, at 9:20 in the morning, Whitaker stepped out next to his car, yellow coffee cup in hand. The Monday Man was leaning against his door, as always. He lifted his blue mug and kindly said: 


“Mondays, am I right?”


Whitaker, beaming with quiet understanding, nodded back, as though sharing in a deep, unspoken truth that only the two of them could understand.",1,1766251672.0,u_Somethingwittycool,0,1.0,False

Quick Flavor Notes: Smoky, tangy, sweet, bitter

Recommended: Yes

Texture: Medium with some small chunks

Ingredients: Cold Brew Coffee, Onion, Apple Cider Vinegar, Chipotle Pepper, Habanero Pepper, Banana, Water, Tomato, Peach, Bell Pepper, Sugar, Vinegar, Garlic, Apple Cider, Liquid Smoke, Fruit Pectin, Salt, Baking Cocoa, Vanilla, Ginger, Cinnamon, Hibiscus, Orange Extract, Nutmeg Thyme.

I have bottles of hot sauce in my pantry that I often skip over when deciding what to open next. Some I bought as part of a multi-pack, some I bought just to get free shipping for the rest of the order, and some were just when I was having a bit of an odd craving on a whim. Regardless of the reason they’re sauces that don’t really fit into my normal preferences and cravings and I glance at them before deciding to open something else. The Spicy Shark Thresher Shark Chipotle was one of those. I don’t normally dig chipotle sauces, finding them either too smoky, too sweet, or both. However, this one is one of the oldest bottles I have laying around so I felt it was time to give it a chance.

The Spicy Shark comes out swinging hard in their typical fashion with a rather unhinged ingredients list. Starting things off with cold brew coffee, something I loved in Queen Majesty’s Red Habanero and Black Coffee, followed by apple cider vinegar and the peppers used – interestingly habaneros in addition to the Chipotle peppers. Here’s where things get weird – bananas, peach, and tomato, not a combination I ever thought I’d see together. With warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla, baking cocoa, sugar, orange extract and hibiscus all showing up later on this sauce goes beyond “kitchen sink” to “this is the result of wacky hijinks” territory. It honestly reads like someone took a hot sauce recipe and a cookie or cake recipe and just combined them. Also notable here is that there’s liquid smoke added. Normally chipotles are more than smoky enough and liquid smoke can be potent stuff. This sauce does smell smoky when you open the bottle. It’s medium in consistency and does have a small bit of texture and chunkiness, though from everything going on I couldn’t tell you what exactly those chunks are.

Here’s the thing about Thresher Shark Chipotle – it’s tastes much better and way less weird than you’d expect from looking at the ingredients. With all of the sweet fruits, spices, and sugar in this I was initially worried it would be way too sweet but the bitterness of the coffee and the unsweetened cocoa are perfect to offset that sweetness and keep this sauce from being cloying. The use of habaneros with the chipotle peppers is also brilliant – you get the smoky flavor from the chipotles (and the liquid smoke) but there’s also a fresh fruity flavor from the habaneros plus some fresh pepper vegetal flavor that cuts through the smoke and keeps it in balance. It’s similar to what Seed Ranch does with their Smoky Ghost Hot Sauce but whereas that one uses two peppers with smoky flavor profiles Thresher Shark Chipotle uses a very fresh and bright pepper to contrast the chipotle. The vinegar and tomato also give this sauce some tanginess which cuts through the rich smoky flavor as well and also helps offset that sweetness. Interestingly this sauce is also super-low sodium at only 5mg per teaspoon but doesn’t taste as if its lacking salt. The overall impression I get from it with the sweet, tangy, smoky, and bitter complexity is of a spicier take on steak sauce.

Since this reminded me of steak sauce, and since Publix has a great deal on strip loin roasts, I used this as a steak sauce for a very simple salt-and-pepper roasted strip loin and the results were amazing. It was even great the next day on cold thinly shaved strip-loin sandwiches. It wasn’t my favorite on Mexican food – I prefer more zing and less sweetness there. Another unexpected success however was in some French Onion Soup I got as part of a takeout order from a local restaurant and which unfortunately ended up being a bit insipid in both color and flavor. The richness and sweet smoky notes of The Spicy Shark Thresher Shark Chipotle blended perfectly with the onions and cheese and added the depth back I’d been missing.

While this isn’t the style of sauce I’d crave every day I did enjoy it and would recommend it, especially if you like sauces with some smoke and a bit of sweetness., or if you’re looking to try something new you can use as a steak sauce. This sauce is also all natural with no artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, or thickeners.",4,1766251554.0,hotsauce,4,1.0,False

About three years later, she is deeply disappointed.

“It’s worse than ever,” the 67-year-old retiree, who relies on Social Security, said when asked about the economy. “The prices are high. Everything is going up. You can’t afford food because you can’t afford rent. Utilities are too high. Gas is too expensive. Everything is too expensive.”

He later served food to men experiencing homelessness in Allentown.

The visit, on top of several recent speeches from President [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump), reflects an increasingly urgent White House effort to respond to the economic anxiety that is gripping both parties.

K so I work at a popular coffee chain and I frequently get sent by my manager to different stores to cover shifts if they need someone. Usually I go to the same few stores and I have an issue with someone at one I’ve been to about 4-5 times. 

I haven’t worked with him every time. But I’ve been working there with him yesterday and today and he’s been making me feel really uncomfortable. The other times I worked with him I could tell he is neurodivergent in some way, which caused him to kind of stare or make jokes that didn’t land which I’m familiar with as my brother has autism I understand. But I haven’t been back to that store in 2 months and he has started to get really weird with me the past two days and he hasn’t acted this way with any of the other actual colleagues in the store. 

\- making jokes about verbally abusing me “im going to verbally abuse you” 

\- making jokes about physically abusing me “there’s no one here so I’m just going to start physically abusing you”

\- is poking me incessantly to the point it actually really hurts my arm because he does it quite hard and when I don’t show a reaction will grab my arm and keep pushing me to get a response and won’t stop even if I tell him to stop

\- when I walk to the part of the bar that doesn’t show up on the camera he says “I can physically abuse you here because the cameras won’t catch it” and starts doing the pushing and poking thing 

\- only does the pushing and poking when there is no one else behind the bar

\- saying I’m not sleeping well because I’m apparently up all night “getting jiggy with my boyfriend” which you can obviously tell he’s referring to sex (I’m actually just going through really bad family problems and emotionally not doing good which is causing me to have insomnia but I’m not going to tell him that) 

\- after I stopped conversing with him in general because I was so uncomfortable with his actions and what he said about my relationship, he started getting really rude, saying things like “what’s that dog chain around your neck” about my necklace that I wear as part of my religion and when I told him it’s religious he started saying really rude things about my religion and probing me about my beliefs like calling me a “cow worshipper”

I’ve only met this guy about 4 times absolutely maximum and I feel really gross and uncomfortable around him feeling like he can put his hands on me and talk to me like that about my religion and my relationship. Especially because he doesn’t act like this when someone else is there and doesn’t treat any of them like that either.

 I don’t work there often but I am going to be working there on Monday to cover a shift and I will be alone with the store manager for a few hours but don’t know how/ what to say or do because I legit don’t work there I’m just covering when my own store manager puts me in. Do I speak to my own store manager or this store manager?

I was a religious 7-day a week customer for most of that stretch, and I almost always ordered the same thing: either a venti iced coffee or Cold Brew with 5 pumps of vanilla and an extra splash of half/half. 

2 weeks ago I was thinking about my budget, and where I could make cuts, later that morning I paid $6.47 for my coffee and took one sip and something snapped in me. It was fine, maybe not quite exactly what I like, but perfectly serviceable. The staff at my store was the same very polite, wonderful group I’ve seen for the better part of 3 years.

But that first sip almost caught in my throat because all I could think is: This is not worth what i just paid for it. This habit, because that’s what it is, is costing me thousands of dollars a year. A product that tastes just ok, and not worth what it costs.

Starbucks is where I basically got my masters degree. Hours spent at a table with my computer and my cold brew. I don’t feel like I could do that again. It doesn’t feel warm anymore, just another corporate box.

I don’t blame the wonderful people at the counter. So many of the baristas and managers I’ve met and many I developed a rapport with are awesome people and deserve so much more. 

I just hope and pray, though most likely in vain, that someone will come in at the top and see what it could be again.

I’m sorry for the novel, I only wanted to express my feelings.

I selected two oil samples, Cheverny and Islette.  The package shipped and arrived quite soon after i ordered, within one week.  I was pleasantly surprised to have one of those samples, islette, fullsized due to them running out of sample vials.  Which was amazingly generous of them. They also included an additional sample for me, a solid perfume sample of Vaux.  I had been curious about solid perfumes but hadn't taken the plunge to try one since I'm on a budget and trusted formats I know better so I was so excited to have the opportunity to try one!

To begin with, the packaging is gorgeous!  The packing slip was a solid sturdy weighted quality paper I wasn't expecting.  The samples came in adorable sealed packs with individual pretty floral art on them.  I love the box for the 5ml and it even had a wax seal on it.  I'm going to keep it.  I really enjoy the floral theming and consistent identity in the packaging.  And amazingly every scent came with a little mini pamphlet with information about the scent and its notes and similar recommendations.  No running to the website to look up the surprise perfume for me!  There was also a lovely postcard with a note.  Overall the presentation just felt really high quality and special.

On to my thoughts

Islette (Honeysuckle | Coffee Flower | Vanilla) -
I absolutely couldn't resist immediately trying straight out of the mail since I was so excited about the upgrade. It made me go oh and sort of sigh immediately.  This is such a pretty scent and i am so pleased to own a fullsize of it.  It starts with a creamy sweetness.  Then the florals shine more.  The florals are soft and gentle with none of the overwhelming nature of most perfumes which causes me to avoid them generally.  It smells like real atmospheric flowers.  I feel soft and feminine and pretty wearing this, and thats not normally something my collection says and I love it for me here.   5/5

Cheverny (Papyrus | Golden Amber | Spices) -
This is the one which was recommended to me.  I can see why it fit the theming.  It smells very dry. I strongly get the paper/papyrus note.  The amber fills out the body.  Theres spice in the air, but not strong.  This house seems to really do nice gentle blends.  I enjoy them.  I can see this having a place for specific moods, but not sure its a big collection mainstay for me.  But its nice.  4/5

Vaux (Coconut | Cardamom | Vanilla) -
This is so warm and pretty!  I did enjoy the solid, it reminds me of lip gloss compacts.  And I was surprised by how strong the scent was when I opened it.  The cardamom comes through beautifully in this scent, so all my fellow cardamom girlies on here take note!  It also blends really well, though this one does have a slight harsh edge at first.  The coconut is surprisingly understated, I usually find the scent overwhelming in most blends, and really just props up the star cardamom note here.  I like it,  its rich and a little creamy.  4.5/5

So all together this was a incredibly successful purchase to me and I am excited to try more.  Islette is for sure the one I would have wanted most of and i'm so happy to have it in my collection!  Especially filling such an empty space as a floral.   I might go back for one or both of the others, I'll need to sit on it more.  I will definitely be back!",7,1766251373.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

1prjlqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1prjlqc/category_based_budgeting_sucks_does_the/,Category based Budgeting Sucks. Does the Segregated Account System Actually Work Better?,"I've been struggling with category based budgeting for a while. I track everything by categories (groceries, entertainment, etc.), but honestly, category-based budgeting isn't helping me make better decisions. Like, is that £150 grocery run really all ""essentials""? Sometimes it's half survival food and half treats I don't need. But the budgeting categories don't capture that, so I'm still making decisions in the dark.

I'm searching for a budgeting strategy that helps me get beyond categories because they're not helping me decide guilt-free.

I saw that viral post about using 4 bank accounts for financial control (\~50K likes). The strategy is:

Account 1: Income Account - Where all income lands. Never spend from it. It's your staging area.

Account 2: Essentials Account - Survival money only. Rent, utilities, food, insurance. Auto-transfer a fixed % here. Nothing else touches it.

Account 3: Freedom/Investing Account - Your wealth engine. Stocks, index funds, real estate. Pay your future self first. Withdrawals only for investments.

Account 4: Fun & Flex Account - Guilt-free spending. Coffee, vacations, date nights. When it's empty, spending stops.

The concept of segregated accounts makes sense—separating income, essentials, investing, and fun into different accounts for better mental accounting.

I'm curious how segregated account systems are actually working for people. Does mental accounting help with financial control, or is it just more complexity?

I also noticed some comments complaining about account fees, which makes sense if you're opening multiple bank accounts (though I know Starling, Monzo, etc. offer free accounts). But beyond that, how's it working for you if you're using segregated responsibility accounts or any other budgeting system? Does it help you make clearer financial decisions, or is it still the same category confusion?

Anyone in the UK actually using this strategy? What's your experience?",3,1766251344.0,UKPersonalFinance,15,1.0,False
1prjll3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1prjll3/most_small_businesses_dont_have_a_branding/,Most small businesses don’t have a branding problem. They have a consistency problem.,"When I first opened my coffee shop, I thought I was done with branding once I had a logo. 

Big mistake.

Six months in, I realized my menu looked nothing like my storefront sign. My Instagram posts used completely different fonts than my flyers. Even my business cards felt like they belonged to a different company.

Here's how it happened:

* Got the logo done first (obviously)
* Rushed the menu design when we were about to open
* Made seasonal posters whenever we needed them
* Used random Canva templates for social media

Each piece looked fine by itself, but put them together? It was like a brand identity crisis.

**The pattern I see everywhere**

Most of us follow the same playbook:

1. Make a logo ✓
2. Design stuff when you need it
3. Try to fix inconsistencies later
4. Repeat until you go crazy

This might work if you've got a designer on speed dial, but when you're doing everything yourself between serving customers and paying bills? Good luck.

The real problem isn't making things look good. It's keeping everything connected.

Same colors, same fonts, same vibe , whether it's your menu, your window signs, or that flyer you're printing at 11 PM because you forgot about tomorrow's event.

**What actually worked for me**

I stopped thinking about each design as a separate project.

Instead of ""I need to make a menu"" it became ""How does this menu fit with everything else I've already made?""

Sounds simple, but it changed everything. I started treating my brand like a system instead of a collection of random files.

Here's what that looked like:

* Decided on my core brand stuff once (colors, fonts, overall vibe)
* Made those decisions non-negotiable 
* Every new thing had to work within those rules

No more starting from scratch every time. No more ""does this look right?"" anxiety.

**The unexpected benefit**

The biggest win wasn't saving time (though that was nice). It was peace of mind.

I stopped second-guessing myself constantly:

* ""Does this poster match my menu?""
* ""Should I try a different font this time?""
* ""Why does my Instagram look like a different business?""

When everything follows the same rules, you can focus on actually running your business instead of redesigning everything every few months.",9,1766251333.0,Entrepreneur,4,1.0,False

one of our sites is in teh business of selling Roasted Coffee Roasted and Packed at origin, So we ship about 2-3 shipments of coffee a week from Colombia to Miami. 

The process is the following.   
\- we create the AWB with all the info, (same info always, same manufactures), COmmercial Invoice, COO, Packing List, Manufacturers Information.  
\- Once this sis done Fedex in Bogota has a desk that creates the PNC for us, Although we coudl also do it and we might start doing it. they send the pnc wihint a few hours.   
\- that pnc is then given to the driver other wise they will not accept the packages and we then forward the pnc to paperwork at fedex.   


however all the emails sent to paperwork if sent right away come back with:  
An open Case for the tracking number you entered was not found. Please check the number and resend an e-mail with the attached docs if incorrect. If you cannot complete this process, please call 1.800.247.4747 and reference your tracking number for further assistance.

once the package hits the US it usually gets delayed due to **Missing PNC.** 

Right now we had packages delayed since December 5th. I usually call 888 327 3395 which is FTN. and then its when I can get in touch with a clearance agent if assigned or get more info, we go to the same stuff over an dover get an email forward the PNC again, manufacturers information. and this happens in 4 out of 5 shipments. 

  
hope someone has had a similar experience and can shed the light on smtg we are not doing correclty

A representative came into my work place and was thoroughly impressed with my customer service skills with not only him but also watching me interact with other customers as well. I have an interview in a few days but only now realized that I *could* be drug tested for marijuana. I live in Pennsylvania where it is medically allowed but not recreational.

 Looking online I got varying answers on whether or not they test for marijuana in 2025, like they'll test you if they're suspicious or that it's up to the branch, etc. I admit I use a cbd/thc tincture orally under the tongue maybe once or twice a week for chronic pain and I got it from a family member who does have a card due to having debilitating MS. I don't have a medical card for it. I am 5'4"" and 120lbs. I have a high metabolism and already drink a lot of water and happen to take b12 vitamin and creatine for my active lifestyle (I am physically active to help manage the pain) but I am aware that thc binds to body fat as an acid and therefore it can take a long time for it to fully be expelled from the body. I saw a lot of people suggesting something called quickfix, I saw a lot of conflicting things about drinking vinegar, lemon juice, fake urine strapped to the leg or crazy detox drinks that sound suspicious or could end up ringing alarm bells if my sample is sent to a lab. Can I drink coffee or fruit juice? Do I lie and say someone someone pressured me into taking something or misrepresent an edible to me to see what would happen? I am a very bad liar and would feel very guilty. Even this post makes me feel hugely ashamed and guilty. Last I used was this past monday night a couple of days before the job offer. And obviously I haven't and won't be using it for the foreseeable future. 

The VP I've been talking to from the bank seems to really like me seeing how I am a very bubbly person, and I actually feel ashamed that I take thc/cbd for my pain and could potentially blow the offer.

A perhaps naive part of me wants to be honest from the get-go if they reveal they'll be testing for it, if at all, to see if they'll still accept me because I was honest from the start. If they don't drug test me initially I won't say anything obviously and will keep clean in the event they surprise me with one down the road. If I don't get the job either from a failed test or some other reason, it won't be the end of the world but would suck because it could mean losing a potentially higher paying job.

I did order drug testing kits from the pharmacy for same day delivery today, but god am I nervous. I would be so happy to have this job but I feel like I already blew things to make my situation in life better and that crushes me immensely. ",1,1766251113.0,careeradvice,6,0.57,False

I am posting here to get things out of my head now that I have been out of an abusive relationship for just over a year now. 

I was in a relationship with my partner for 7 years, things weren’t always good but they weren’t bad either we both worked full time and they were remote. Since I made less money (working full time) I did all of the house work including laundry and cooking all meals and doing the dishes, I also did sports transportation for their (not my) son. The neglect and FA started during the pandemic. Financially I contributed exactly 85% of my income to the household (including a child in private school) therefore I lived on anywhere between $80-$100 a week for all of my personal needs including fuel for my daily commute to my extremely physically demanding job, this lead to many skipped lunches and the occasional running out of gas, I came home every day to Amazon packages on the front porch. I was dragged in several “family vacations” here it was my job to make the long drives and cater to partner and son, the record for dollar amount left in my bank account while leaving for these vacations was $4.86, does anyone know what it feels like to go on a 5 day vacation without enough personal money to even buy a full meal? How about a couple of trips a year? Our sex life took a nosedive and it was always my fault in some way (not contributing enough, not having a second job, not starting my own business with all of the extra energy and money that I had) at some point my partner decided to sell their car and buy a much newer one. I, unsurprisingly, developed a drinking problem because of this relationship, and was told that if I was ever going to have another sip of alcohol to just not come back home. (Which is unreasonable to someone who’s nervous system is dependent on alcohol, quitting cold turkey is incredibly dangerous) 

Long story short I packed a bag and left. Straight up walked away. Everything I own fits in my car anyways. I got myself sober and was diagnosed  with MDD and subsequently got medicated. I quit my job so that I could focus on my mental health for the first time in my life and have now been single and unemployed for a year (thanks to the support of my siblings). The funny part about all of it is I’m REALLY FUCKING GOOD at being broke, I run on leftovers and cheap coffee, I am working on setting boundaries mostly so that I can tolerate capitalism when I go back to work, I don’t see myself ever trusting the opposite sex again so I am just going to spoil myself for the rest of my life.

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'd say I'm kinda cute? (I'll send selfies early on so you can be the judge of that yourself!). I finished my bachelors a while ago and now I work in public administration.

**In my free time, I'm into**

* **Reading** (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* **Artsy stuff** (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* **Cooking** (I love showing care through food!)
* **Gaming** (would love to play some co-op together c: - big fan of co-op horror if that's your vibe!)
* **Binge-watching shows**
* **Fitness** (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* **Traveling**
* **Self-care** (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan or Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (🙏PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.

**Thanks for reading <3**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!😗). Like the title implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but anywhere in EU is alright too.

**So, get in those DMs already!**

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan or Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (🙏PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.

**Thanks for reading <3**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!😗). Like the title implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but anywhere in EU is alright too.

**So, get in those DMs already!**

A quick hello with your age and the country you're from is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions!

1prjazn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1prjazn/i_dont_feel_like_i_fit_in_anywhere/,I don't feel like I fit in anywhere,"Hi all.

This is mostly just a rant and I'm honestly looking for some encouragement. Advice if you have it. This is coming from a cis-gendered man in his early thirties with some mental disabilities. I am early in my career, have a good degree, am decent looking and take care of myself. I want to attract a partner who would also do these things.

I grew up with a dad and a sister, my mom passed when I was young. I grew up admiring women who were powerful and safe, who I thought would protect me and maybe eventually in my lifetime I would see women leaders pop up around the world. If you've seen it, I admired Azula from Avatar the Last Airbender while that was airing, but I was also afraid of her at the same time. This was when I was very young and discovering what I liked about women.

Today, I admire women with strong arms and developing careers. Strong, independent women who are confident and assertive, but not mean, dismissive, or hurtful.

A dream date idea for me would be us watching a horror movie at home, and she would put her arm around me and make me feel safe. I want to be able to be afraid and vulnerable around her and she keeps me safe.

This all to say, I don't relate to most men for this reason. So, ""days with the guys"" aren't always the most enjoyable to me. I don't meet many other men who are like me, but I know they exist. I don't like the way most men talk about women. I also don't relate to many nerds (which many of us are) since I don't like anime or a lot of stereotypical gamer things.

I also get attracted to lesbians a lot, usually the strong ones. I think I'm also attracted to their confidence, because it requires a certain amount of confidence to be outwardly gay, even today. I hung out with a lot of lesbians in college thanks to association with my sister, and they really helped me with my confidence in talking to women since they wanted me to succeed. It does suck that I don't fit in with the LGBT crowd either, because I am straight.

The closest subreddit I've found where I sort of relate to people is gentlefemdom, which is a very welcoming subreddit and I encourage a look. I don't want to be a house husband, and I don't want to dress up in maid outfits or anything. I want a partner where it's more of a I'm supporting and she's leading kind of deal. Nothing extreme, just where she has more ""authority"" for lack of a better word. I have yet to find the right word for what I mean.

This might sound strange, but I'd really just like to watch women lift weights and workout, but most of the subreddits are hypersexual. I genuinely just like to see muscular women and them be happy with themselves and their progress and them developing. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a turn on to look at, but I also want to normalize men liking strong women more.

I genuinely wish there was at least a few countries where women were more in charge. For some reason, people correlate this to BDSM or femdom, but I'm talking about (politics aside, literally just the people) Sanna Marin, Jacinda Ardern, AOC; all women having a more prominent role in politics and shaping the country and it's direction.

I want to do things for my partner to make their life easier. I want to make them coffee in the morning, get them water while they're working out, do the dishes after they're done cooking; things that I genuinely want to do while at the same time, I would imagine at least, would be attractive qualities in a partner. I would want her to support me too, although honestly I'm not sure what I would want. I mean to say I don't want it to be a one way street.

My last girlfriend made me the happiest. She took the lead without me asking, sending the first message and asking me out. On our first date, as I was getting my wallet out to pay, she slapped her credit card down before I could even open it. She walked me to my car, got my number, and asked if she could kiss me. No woman has ever done that for me before and I loved every second of it. We dated for about three months and she broke up with me because she discovered she was asexual. We did have sex twice at the beginning of the relationship, but I thought it was more of a give her time and let her get comfortable thing. She didn't want to take sex away from me, so she felt like the healthiest thing would be to break up. (Looking back, I should have seen it as a red flag. It's a longer story and this is already too long.)

I've tried to find books that I could read with badass women who save men, almost like the reverse of most fantasy novels. I haven't really found anything that sticks. If you have recommendations please let me know.

I am a natural homebody. I don't like to go out much, not many things are to interesting to me. I do play piano, am getting into chess, and read and workout at home. I don't know where to go to meet people who I would relate to or where to meet women I'd be compatible with. I do workout, so I'd be open to something like yoga or Pilates, but I've also been told women don't want straight men around there. I want to make friends and eventually get married to someone.

Thank you for reading if you got this far. Even if you didn't read this whole thing, thank you for looking at the post.

Feel free to comment with your advice if you have any. I appreciate you.

I enjoy listening to pop music and sometimes classical music. I would prefer having cleaner mids and highs.

I love bass but I don't want the music to be too tiring.

I play music mostly from my phone and sometimes from my laptop. The source of music is usually Youtube or Amazon Music.

Here are my 3 considerations:

 1) Bookshelf speakers

\- Pros

\- Size. I can place them anywhere, even on my coffee station.

\- Cons

\- It will need a bluetooth receiver.

\- This will perhaps reduce the sound quality.

\- It will need a power source.

\- It will need a subwoofer (Not too sure about this one)

2) Floorstanding speakers

I don't know if I need 1 or 2 floorstanding speakers.

\- Pros

\- It will provide better sound quality.

\- It will looks amazing aesthetically

\- Cons

\- It will take up more space.

\- It will need a power source.

\- It will need a subwoofer (Not too sure about this one)

\- No Bluetooth support.

\- Same problem as the bookshelf speakers.

3) Bluetooth speakers

Eg. Bose SoundLink Revolve Plus, Harmon Kardon Aura Studio 3, Sonos Move, etc.

\- Pros

\- It will take up less space.

\- It will provide better sound quality.

\- It will have Bluetooth support.

\- Cons

\- I am not sure if they are very good with Mids and Highs.

\- I think the audio quality is not as good as the bookshelf / floorstanding speakers.

Can anyone help me with my decision?

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

In the world of whisky there is the idea of the [infinity bottle](https://punchdrink.com/articles/how-infinity-bottle-blend-became-whiskey-nerd-obsession/) where you have a little bit left of a few bottles of whisky and you just mix them all together, and as you drink your whiskys, when you only have a little left in your bottle, you pour it into the blend you've been maintaining. Has anyone tried anything similar with coffee beans? I ask because I recently had only a few grams left each in 2 different bags of Colombian beans (different producers and roasters but similar roast profiles) and so just decided to blend the two together and make an espresso out of them. Maybe this was a subconscious bias on my part from having had the idea to mix them, but the espresso turned out great with very unique notes, and when I ran low on another bag of beans (this time from India), I just added them to the blend and labeled the bag my ""infinity"" blend.

Does anyone else do this? Could this eventually run into issues with old beans? I do keep my beans in the freezer always for longevity's sake but there's surely a limit to how long they can stay there.",0,1766250458.0,espresso,5,0.33,False

“Ladies and gentlemen, please put your tray tables up and seats into the upright position in preparation for our landing at the Sheremetyevo Airport...”

Elaine peered out the window.  It was very early morning, but still dark outside.  She could make out the farmland below, covered in snow.  She could even see some of the so-called “dachas” dotting the countryside, massive brick mansions standing half-finished and abandoned.  She remembered Nick telling her about them, leaning over her, looking out the window, his cheek almost touching hers.

*The Russian Mafia built those things after the Soviet Union collapsed.  Then the gang wars started, and they killed each other off before the dachas were even finished.*

Elaine told herself not to think of Nick.  She said a silent prayer for him, hoping that wherever he was, he was all right.

The big aircraft soon landed and rolled to a stop at the gate.  When the stewardess opened the door, Elaine was one of the first passengers to deplane.  She knew there would be a big line at Passport Control and wanted to get through it as soon as possible so as not to keep the Secret Service agents waiting for her.

As she stepped out into the gate area, there were two men in gray suits and trench coats watching everyone who walked by.  She could spot the Secret Service image a mile off.  She was surprised—she hadn’t expected them to meet her right here at the gate.  That really was VIP treatment.

The eyes of one of the men locked on her face.

She stepped up and offered her hand.  “Elaine Brogan.  Thanks for meeting me, guys.”

The man grabbed her wrist and the other one took hold of her arm.  “US Secret Service.  Come along quietly, please.”

“What are you—wait a minute—”

“Move along,” the man on the left said, his arm tightening. “We don’t want any trouble.”

“My name is Elaine *Brogan*.  Aren’t you with the Secret Service?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

They were moving her towards a door on the corridor marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.  Struggling against their grip, she said, “You’re supposed to meet me and take me to my hotel.”

The two men exchanged glances, and one of them chuckled. “You’re going to a hotel, all right.  One with bars on all the windows.”   He keyed in a code and then they forced her through the door.  They continued down a corridor.

Elaine was suddenly panic-stricken.  *They must have gotten me confused with someone else*.  

They took her through a door marked *DOPROC*.   She was well versed in Russian, and she knew that word:  Interrogation.

Elaine was terrified.

The windowless room had a long, scarred rectangular table with a few metal folding chairs surrounding it.  Some empty coffee cups and ragged looking Russian newspapers were scattered about.

“You’re in deep shit,” one of them said.   He was taller and older than the other one, and had a pockmarked face.

“Hand it over,” the younger man said.

Elaine looked at them, bewildered.  “Hand *what* over?”

“Look, we know you took it, so you can stop the innocent act.  You can voluntarily give it to us, or we’ll strip search you.”

“And that won’t be fun,” the other man said, with a smile.  “At least, not for you.”

Elaine swallowed, looking from one face to another.  What in the world was happening to her?  This didn’t make any sense.

“Look, my name is Elaine Brogan, and I work for—”

“Give me your bags,” the pockmarked man said, and wrenched both away from her. He dumped out the contents of both her handbag and suitcase onto the table.  

“You’re really screwing up,” she said, trying to maintain her composure.  “I’ll have you both fired.”

When it was evident that whatever they were looking for was not in the bags, both men looked back at her.

“I told you you were making a mistake,” Elaine snapped.  “Now would one of you kindly call your office and—”

“Strip, lady.”

Elaine recoiled.  “I *beg* your pardon?”

The pockmark-faced man nodded to the younger one.  “Give me your knife.”  He looked at Elaine as he slowly drew out the blade, the silver glinting in fluorescent lights.

Elaine was paralyzed with fear.  These two were out of control.  They could do whatever they wanted with her in this interrogation room—there were no cameras that she could see, no two-way mirrors.

The man picked up her suitcase and opened it wide.  She winced as the knife cut through the lining.

“You’re going to pay for that suitcase,” she said, her mouth dry.

Her eyes widened as the man withdrew a sleek black cylinder.  It was the “salt shaker,” the high capacity data key for the project she had just finished.  It contained all the data—the fourteen common mistakes in the counterfeits, hundreds of super high resolution scans of the fake banknotes, the three crucial errors that the new software would look for.  In short, all the research data that had been used to create the software updates.

Elaine’s heart went into her throat.  

“You’re under arrest,” he said flatly.  “Gene Lassiter told us this was missing from his safe yesterday afternoon. You can look forward to twenty years in a federal penitentiary, with no chance of parole.”  

The other man produced a plastic EVIDENCE bag and he dropped it in, and he started writing on the label.

“Somebody planted that there!” 

“Sure, lady.”

“I’m being framed!”

“Uh-huh.”

The room was spinning.  Elaine’s mind raced from one thought to another.  Somebody had set her up.  Gene Lassiter.  It had to be Lassiter!  No one else had the combination to his safe...

Then she remembered what had taken place in his office yesterday, when he was slumped on his couch.

*Would you get me my pills, Elaine?  They’re in my desk.*

She had opened every one of his desk drawers!  Her fingerprints were all over them.

She pulled her phone from her pocket.  She had to call someone— Nick?

The pockmarked man snatched it from her hand.  “You’re not making any calls.” He set it down on the corner of the table, far out of her reach.

The two men stepped over to the other side of the room out of earshot, talking to each other in low voices.  This couldn’t be...how could Lassiter have done this to her?

Elaine was only dimly aware of the men’s conversation—she felt like her ears were filled with cotton, and the voices were far away.

“...the extradition papers...”

“...hold her at the American Embassy while...”

“...they’ll want to fly her back to D.C. on a diplomatic jet for formal charging...”

*This can’t be happening*, she thought dazedly.  *This can’t be happening.*

The two men walked over to the door.  “Keep your ass in that chair,” the one with the evidence bag said, pointing at her.  They both went outside and pulled the door shut behind them.

A sense of unreality swept over her.  Elaine gaped at her open suitcase, all her personal items scattered around the table.  

*You’ll spend the next twenty years in a federal penitentiary, with no chance of parole.*

She saw herself wearing numbered orange coveralls, standing in line holding a metal food tray, shuffling around with shackles on her wrists and ankles...

Just like her father.

Elaine’s eyes were drawn to a clock on the wall.  She watched the red needle of the second hand slowly move around the face.  Twenty *years* in prison.  She suddenly stood up, her vision blurred.  There was a sink in the corner.  She rushed over to it and vomited.  

As she wiped her mouth, she realized how quiet it was in the room.  And then she looked at the can of hair spray, the hair brush...she could assemble her gun.  Maybe she could escape.

Then she again noticed how quiet the room was.  Suddenly, she heard men’s voices out in the corridor.  They were laughing, speaking Russian.

She looked over at the door.  The handle turned.

Elaine quickly sat back down.

Several huge Russian men sauntered into the room.  They were all wearing blue Aeroflot coveralls, with photo ID badges clipped to their pockets.  Each man held a steaming paper cup in his hand.   They stopped talking when they saw Elaine.

“*Kto ti*?” one of them said, staring.  *Who are you?*

“Who are you?”

One of them turned and muttered, “*Americanka*,” to the others.  The whole group sipped their coffee, watching her.

“I think you should not be here,” another man said, in thickly accented English.  “This secure area of airport.”

“*Puskai ostayotcia, ona ochen krasivaya*” another said.  *Let her stay, she’s very beautiful.* 

The men all chuckled good-naturedly.  They just stood there, drinking their coffee, smiling at her.  

Elaine glanced at the open door.  The sign that had said DOPROC had disappeared.

“Where am I?” she said, standing up.

They glanced at each other, puzzled.

“You are in the Aeroflot baggage handler recreation room.”  The man smiled.  “Would you like some coffee?”

\* \* \*

Elaine madly threw all her things back into her suitcase, then banged out through the door that opened onto the main concourse, her mind racing.  

The two men weren’t with the Secret Service—they were with the Russian Mafia!  She’d been tricked and let them get away with the data key.  

Lassiter had used her to transport the data key out of the United States.  He must have sold it to the Russian Mafia.

It was unbelievable to her, but it was the only logical explanation.

She had to get it back.  It was the only way she could stop herself from being framed.  If she could recover it, she could take it back to Washington and go to the highest authorities—to the Executive Treasurer, or the Director of the Secret Service.  She could explain everything that had happened—surely they would believe her.

As she ran down the concourse toward Passport Control, she mentally recounted everything that had happened yesterday in Lassiter’s office.  A demonstration at the Bank of Russia?  For all she knew, there was no demonstration—the project was so top secret the only information she ever received was directly from Lassiter’s mouth.  Furthermore, she had no evidence that he had told her he was going to Russia, or that she had agreed to go in his place!  She had bought the plane ticket herself, with her own credit card—a one-way ticket!  

My god, she thought—I looked as if I fled the USA with no intention of ever coming back!

When Elaine reached the sprawling Passport Control area, she found it packed with hundreds of weary travelers, waiting in endless queues.  The two Russian thieves had probably left the airport some other way.  It would be a miracle if she could get that data key back now...

Far ahead, Elaine could see the staffed booths: RUSSIAN PASSPORTS, EU PASSPORTS, ALL OTHER PASSPORTS.  At the very far side of the room, she spotted another booth: DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS/VIP SERVICE.  There was no queue in front of it.

Elaine dashed in that direction and fished out her fake Irish diplomatic passport from the hidden slot in her suitcase.  When she slid it under the window of the booth, the uniformed male Russian officer opened it and peered at it as she stood there, catching her breath.

O’NEILL, SHANNON, the name read.  The seal of the Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was clearly visible on the pale gray paper.

“And how long vil you be in Russia?” the officer asked slowly, rolling the r in Russia.

“Just a wee time, a few days,” Elaine said, turning on her Irish accent.   She glanced beyond the partition, into Baggage Claim\*.  Come on\*, she thought\*.  Hurry up!\*

The officer looked closely at Elaine’s face, then peered at the passport again.  Finally, he picked up a heavy stamp and *ka-thumped* it on one of the open pages.  “Enjoy your stay.”

Elaine rushed from the booth and entered the baggage area, then headed straight down the hallway marked GREEN LINE – NOTHING TO DECLARE, rolling her suitcase along behind her.  When she emerged into the airport lobby, there were throngs of people huddled around the exit from Customs—men, women, children, many holding bouquets, their eyes anxiously scanning the arriving passengers for their loved ones.

Elaine pushed ahead, tripping over people and luggage, frantically searching for the two men who had conned her.  She was immediately accosted by a gaggle of leather-clad taxi drivers.

“Cheap taxi to center!”

“Very low price—”

“One hundred dollars—”

“New Mercedes, very comfortable—”

“Get out of my way,” Elaine snapped, plowing through them.  

She followed the signs to ground transportation.  When she stepped out onto the sidewalk, she was struck by a blast of cold air that chilled her to the bone—the temperature was well below zero.  It was still dark outside, and the parking lot was covered with snow.

Elaine desperately scanned the lot for the men, peering into the windows of the passing vehicles.

*They’re probably long gone by now*, she thought, terror-stricken.  *What I am going to do?*

She desperately tried to think of someone who could help her, but the only person that came to mind was Nick.  And he was in jail somewhere.

Then, across the parking lot, she spotted the man with the pockmarked face.  He was unlocking the door of a large black SUV.  The other man was not with him.

“Taxi?” a voice said from behind her.

Elaine whirled around, afraid it was the second man.  But it was only a taxi driver, in the usual Russian taxi driver outfit—a cheap-looking brown faux leather jacket, a plaid scarf, and a black driver’s cap.  He looked harmless—big, but with stooped over shoulders.  He had sad eyes that reminded her of a basset hound’s.

“I give very good price to center,” he said, vapor pluming from his mouth.  “Ninety dollars.  My car not so good—” he pointed to a little beat-up Lada that was splattered with brown slush,”— but price very good.”  

The black SUV was pulling away now.

“Fine, let’s go,” she said, moving towards his car.

The big man moved surprisingly fast for his size.   He rushed over to the Lada and opened the passenger door for her, throwing the front seat forward.  She climbed into the back of the cramped little Russian-made vehicle.

He got in and started the engine.  “Which hotel?”

“See that black SUV?” Elaine said, pointing.

“Jeep?”

“Yes, jeep.”  She had forgotten that’s what Russians called all SUVs.  “Follow the jeep.”

As he pulled away, Elaine nervously glanced around the inside of the car, taking everything in, sizing him up.  Attached to the dashboard was a square icon of Mary Magdalene.  Next to it was a clipboard with color flyers for nightclubs, photos of scantily clad women on the front. In the compartment below, a dog-eared road atlas and a couple of short fishing poles, the type used for ice fishing.  

She didn’t think he was anything other than what he appeared to be, an independent taxi driver.  

The SUV was picking up speed.  It soon disappeared around the ramp that led to the highway.

“Don’t lose it,” Elaine said, her voice trembling.

The driver glanced at Elaine again.  “If you will simply say which hotel —”

“I don’t know which hotel!”  Elaine tried to think of a reasonable sounding explanation.   “That’s my friend, I don’t know where he’s going.  Okay?”

“Okay,” the driver said, looking skeptical.

Elaine was too preoccupied with recovering the data key to think up excuses for a taxi driver. She checked out the back window to make sure they were not being followed.  The road was clear behind them.

They soon caught up with the SUV.

“Hang back,” Elaine said.

“*Shto*?”  the driver said.

“Stay behind the jeep, but don’t lose it.”  Elaine wasn’t sure if he understood.  “*Panyatno*?”

“*Panyatno*,” he said, glancing at her again in the rearview.  He knew something strange was going on.

Elaine was frantically trying to think of a way to stop the SUV.   She didn’t have much time, she had to act *now*.  She considered calling the Moscow Secret Service field office and trying to explain what had happened, but it was too risky.  Lassiter might have already called them, telling them she had stolen the data key.   At this point, she couldn’t trust anyone.

Elaine opened her suitcase and began assembling the Sig Sauer, keeping it out of the driver’s sight.  At least she still had the gun.

They came to a cloverleaf—the SUV took the ramp that said MOSCOW – CENTRE.  

The driver kept looking at Elaine in the rearview—he had heard the clicking of the pistol as she snapped it together.

Suddenly, he pulled a cellphone from his pocket and began punching in a number with his thumb.

“*Ne zvonite telefon*,” Elaine said, alarmed.

He gazed at her through the mirror, hesitating, his finger poised over the keypad.  

She pressed the gun barrel against the back of his neck.  “I said no telephone calls.  Put the goddam phone down in the passenger seat.”

He quickly tossed the device over into the other seat and raised both his hands in the air.  He stared at her through the rearview, the basset hound eyes wide and frightened.  

“Keep steering!” she said, as the car started to veer into the other lane.

He put his hands back on the wheel, but he looked so nervous Elaine was afraid he would panic.  She pulled out her Treasury Department badge and held it up so he could see it through the rearview.  Speaking Russian slowly and carefully, she said, “I am a special police agent from America.  I will not harm you.  Just do your job and follow that jeep.”  She paused, then added, “If you do well, I will give you a big tip.”

He looked even more frightened.  

Elaine was confused...then realized that she had used the wrong word for “tip,” which was a variant of the Russian word for tea.  She had told him that if he did a good job, she would give him a big tea kettle.

“I meant extra money,” she said, rubbing her fingers together.  “*Dengi*.  Understand?”

“Ah.”  He gave a nervous smile.  “Extra money good.” He watched her for a moment through the mirror.  “It is very exciting for me to help American FBI.  I like exciting life.  My life very borink.”

*He thinks I’m an FBI agent,* Elaine thought.   *Let him think that.*

“My name is Dmitry.  What is your name?” 

“Janet,” she lied, saying the first name that came into her head.

“Janyet.  This is nice American name.”

Now they were in heavy traffic and were coming to the first stoplights they had encountered since leaving the airport. If she waited much longer, the man in the jeep might meet someone else, and then it might be impossible to get the key back.  She considered jumping out of the car, running up to the SUV, and trying to catch the driver by surprise.  She could smash the window open and put the gun to his neck...but the windows might be bulletproof—the Russian Mafia was famous for its heavily armored vehicles.  On top of that, dozens of people in other cars would see her.  If someone called the police, no telling what would happen.

“I help you, Janyet,” Dmitry said, breaking into Elaine’s thoughts.  “If you want.”

She studied his face as he gazed up at her through the rearview.  She wasn’t sure she could trust him.  Pushing the barrel a little harder into his neck, she said, “Who were you going to call on your phone?”

He raised his hands innocently.  “I only call my wife.  She worry when I working all night.”  He looked ahead at the SUV again, shaking his head.  “I hate Mafia! I *honest* taxi driver,” he said emphatically, pronouncing the “h” in honest.  “Mafia no let me go inside airport, take all my customers.”  He paused.  “I have daughter.  She study at Moscow State University to be doctor.”  There was great pride in his voice.  “I wish American FBI come and kill all Mafia, like on television!”

“That’s a task for your police,” Elaine muttered.

“Our police?”  He gave a big belly laugh.  “Our police, Mafia, same thing.”  Dmitry raised both his big paws in the air.  “All one big Mafia.”

“Do you really want to help me?” she asked.

“*Da*, Janyet.  I already say I want help you.”  He paused.  “For little extra money, of course...”

“Then listen very carefully...”

\* \* \*

When she finished explaining her plan, Dmitry’s face turned pale.

“Janyet...this very dangerous.  If I do what you say, this man in jeep will kill me.”

“He won’t kill you.  He’s not interested in you, Dmitry.  Trust me.  He’ll tell you to go away.”

Dmitry swallowed, staring through the windshield at the SUV.  It was only one hundred feet ahead of them now.  They had just crossed the Moscow River.  The traffic had thickened.  The sky was showing the first violet hues of dawn.

“You ask too much, Janyet.”

“I thought you told me you wanted some excitement in your life?”

Dmitry, winced, looking like he sorely regretted those words.

“I’ll pay you well,” Elaine said, remembering the cash she had with her.  “Very well.”

She could see temptation in his eyes.  Making the sign of the cross over his chest, he pressed on the accelerator and closed in on the SUV.

Elaine rolled down the back window, raising the pistol.  The frigid wind whipped across her cheeks.  The SUV was in the left-hand lane, tailgating the car in front of it.  They were easing up on the right-hand side. 

“Closer!” Elaine shouted, over the wind\*.  I hope to God this works\*, she thought.  As they neared the SUV, she aimed the gun at its spinning back tire.  

“Closer!” she said.  She wasn’t taking any chances.

Dmitry pressed a little harder on the gas.  Now the jeep’s rear wheel was almost within reach of her arm.

Elaine pulled the trigger.  

The tire exploded, then made a *flop-flop-flop* sound as the rubber began to shred.

Dmitry hit the brakes and let the SUV swerve in front of them.

“Now!” she said.

“*Bozhe moi*,” Dmitry muttered, then let up on the brake.  Two seconds later the front end of the Lada slammed into the rear of the SUV.  It was enough to throw Elaine forward but not enough to do any serious damage to either vehicle.

Both cars came to a stop on the shoulder of the road.  Elaine ducked down to the floorboard.  Dmitry reluctantly opened his door.  He looked terrified when he saw the big, pockmark-faced man open the door of the SUV and lumber towards him, scowling.

“*Durak*!” the man shouted.  “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“You stopped too fast,” Dmitry said in Russian, walking cautiously towards him.  “I—I was not prepared...”  

The man stepped behind the SUV and peered down at the flat tire, cursing.

“I’ll help you change it,” Dmitry said, with no enthusiasm at all.

The man opened the SUV’s rear door.  “Get the hell out of here.”

Dmitry did not need any more persuasion.  He quickly walked back towards the Lada. 

While they were talking, Elaine had slipped out of the car.  She was squatting behind the Lada’s bumper.  Traffic was passing by, some of the cars honking.  

As soon as the man bent down and tried to fit the jack under the car, she dashed forward.  

The next thing the man knew, the barrel of the Sig Sauer was pressing into the back of his head.

“Lie face down on the ground,” Elaine barked, adrenaline pumping through her veins.  Pushing him down into the gravel, she grabbed both his arms and pulled them behind his back.  She felt around and felt inside his jacket.  There was a pistol in one pocket.  She pulled it out and flung the weapon down the embankment, into the snow.  In the other pocket, she found the data key.

“You’re dead,” he said, as she pocketed it.

She leapt off him and backed up towards the Lada.  “Stay on the ground!” she said, but he climbed to his feet.  There was a noxious sheen in his eyes.

Dmitry had the Lada’s passenger door open for her.  Just as she reached it, the man suddenly bent and plucked something from his ankle.  An instant later the object was flipping end over end through the air towards Elaine, end over end, metal glinting in car headlights.  

The stiletto tore through Elaine’s wool coat and pierced her side.

Elaine gasped and stumbled into the Lada’s back seat.  Dmitry stared through the rearview, frozen with fear, his eyes wide.

“Go!” Elaine yelled.

Dmitry pressed on the accelerator, burning rubber.

The man ran at the car, smashing his fist into the passenger window, but the Lada grazed him and knocked him to the pavement.

“*Bozhe moi*!” Dmitry yelled.

\* \* \*

“You are hurt!” Dmitry said.

Elaine braced herself, then yanked the stiletto out of her side.   Blood spurted.  For a second she was terrified, afraid she might have been seriously wounded.  But the pick-like instrument had only pierced an inch or so of flesh.  No internal damage had been done.

“I have medic kit,” Dmitry said, fumbling to open the glove compartment.

“Just drive, Dmitry!”

With one hand pressing against her side to stop the bleeding, she opened the first aid kit, pulled up her red-stained blouse, and applied a stick-on bandage to her side.

Dmitry was looking nervously between the road ahead and the rearview.

“Where go now, Janyet?  Where go now?”

Elaine looked out at the heavy traffic.  She changed her mind about trying to go back to the airport.  “Do you know where the American Embassy is?”  

“*Da*.”  He drove faster, tailgating the car in front. 

If they could make it to the embassy, she could call the Treasurer, or the Secretary Treasurer, and explain everything over the phone.  She would turn the data key over to the embassy staff.  They would have to believe her.

She could hardly believe she’d gotten the data key back.  But she’d done it!

Dmitry was looking distractedly into the rearview.  

“What’s the matter?” Elaine said anxiously.  She was afraid to turn around and look.  No way could it be the SUV—it would be impossible to drive with that shredded tire.

“Hummer,” Dmitry said.  

Elaine gathered the courage to look.  The wide, menacing black vehicle was creeping up behind them.  The glass in the Hummer’s windshield was tinted so heavily that it was impossible to see inside.  

“It is Mafia,” Dmitry said, his voice wavering with fear.  

“How do you know?”

“Mafia like Hummer.”

Elaine fought panic—she wasn’t about to let them catch her now, not after all this!

The traffic was thickening as they neared the center of the city.  Ahead, she could see a river of red brake lights that looked like it went on for miles.  The embassy was on the other side of town...they would never make it.

She glanced across the median to the other side of the road.  The traffic back towards the Sheremetyevo Airport was moving along freely.

“Turn around,” she said.

Dmitry hesitated.  “But—”

“Turn around!” she said.  “We’re going back to the airport.”

\* \* \*

The sky was growing lighter, a fine snow falling from gunmetal gray clouds.  Elaine and Dmitry were only a few miles from the Sheremetyevo Airport, but the Hummer was riding their rear bumper.

If she could lose them, somehow, and make it inside the airport, she thought there was a good chance she could flee the country before they could catch her.  She had the fake Irish passport, which nobody knew about, at least not yet.  Sheremetyevo was a very busy airport, with flights leaving every couple of minutes to destinations all over the world.  She had plenty of money—she could buy some clothes in one of the shops and disguise herself, then purchase a ticket on the first flight out.

Dmitry looked petrified, both his hands clutching the steering wheel as if he were holding onto it for dear life.

She looked back at the trailing Hummer again.  “What about losing them on some small roads?” Elaine said.  

Dmitry motioned to the rearview.  “How?  They have Hummer, we have Lada.”

Elaine pointed the gun at the dashboard.  “Open your road atlas and show me where we are.”

Dmitry pulled out the frayed book and turned to the middle.  They were just approaching a town called Burtsevo.  Elaine leaned forward, studying the map.

“What about taking this route?” she said, indicating a small highway that branched off into a forest.  It looked like it continued almost all the way to the airport.  “Can you think of a way to lose them along here?”

“I know this *rejone* well, Janyet—I often fishing in river.”  She saw a thick blue line that snaked through the middle of the green area.  “But there is no way lose them.  I already say you—they have *Hummer* and we have Lada.”

“A Hummer is very wide,” Elaine said, “and your car is very narrow.  Is there some place this car can go that a Hummer *can’t* go?”

She saw the flicker of an idea cross his face.

“What?” Elaine said.

When he didn’t answer, she pushed the gun against his neck again.  “Speak up, Dmitry.”

He swallowed.  “In forest, trees very close together.  Too close together for Hummer.”

“Get off at the next exit.” ",1,1766250340.0,thrillers,0,1.0,False

I’m a 23-year male, born and raised in Katargam, Surat (pure Suraties). Currently working in an MNC IT company (Mumbai).

Most of my old friends are now outside India, and I don’t really have a social circle here — no office, college, or school friends nearby. Feeling quite alone, so I thought of reaching out.

I’m posting here because I genuinely want to make new friends — male or female, doesn’t matter — just good people to talk to, hang out with, or even plan casual meetups like:

chai / coffee ☕
walks, food exploring
movies, tech talks, or just conversations
Nothing weird — just genuine friendship.

If you’re from Surat / nearby areas and feel the same, comment or DM.

But this last time trying to get any help whatsoever was a nightmare. First off none of platform links work. You **have** to talk to someone via in-app customer support. (first video, don’t know why tiktok added a dim filter btw) 

and in my case I think it’s 1 person running the entire US because, when I was able to connect with someone, I got the same person twice. 

**ANELE**

**BACKSTORY:**

Since I have been a customer for a while I have tried many flavors they offer. And not really any of them I like very much, ***BUUUUUT*** I do like the unflavored one because I can make so much with it. Put it in oatmeal, in a piña colada, coffee, make whatever flavor protein shake, you name it. So **I usually go for an 11lb bag** that they sell. I’ll get it around holiday sales and it will last me till their next holiday sale. 

But **recently** they have been sending **(2) 5.5lb bags instead of (1) 11lb bag.** 

So on black friday I ordered my 11lb bag, except I ordered **fruity cereal.** 

I get the delivery and don’t think that it is a different flavor because I always just reorder my last order. I made about 10 shakes for the upcoming week and noticed something was waaay off. my whole kitchen smelled like a car wash. It was then that I checked and sure enough I ordered and received the wrong flavor i was wanting. 

Hadn’t really dealt with costumer service since my order was really late about 2-3 years ago. So I hop on and **ANELE** mentioned earlier took my case. 

All I wanted to do was get an **exchange** from this nasty flavor to my unflavored one. and not even the one I opened, I figured that one was a loss and just chalked it up to being SOL. The second video is of our chat…

I (24m) met a girl (20f) at work last month. I work there full-time, she's an intern at a completely different department. She just dropped by to my workplace where I saw her for the first time, we chatted a bit, got to know the basics and that was it.

The following weeks went with a breeze, I saw her sometimes on the elevator, exchanging glances, having brief small-talk, until she came to work with me for 1 hour. We talked over some stuff like her interests/hobbies and mine, but still, getting any more comfortable was pretty impossible due to the nature of the work (I work at a hospital).

Then, I wished her a happy birthday and two days ago when she was sitting alone at the cafeteria during lunch break I took the opportunity to sit close to her and we chatted for about half an hour. It was productive, she asked stuff about me, I asked back, she seemed laid back and relaxed, and I used a cheeky line to get her Instagram.

**Now, there's the following facts:**

Talking at work is near to impossible since the only way for me to do that is to encroach other people's workspace just to talk with the intern (and only when I myself aren't busy), and the fact she's there only like 10 hours per week

She's gone home for the christmas holidays, and after that she's only going to be here for one week, which is my last week as well, in February I'm moving abroad (Which she knows about)

My only real chance of talking to her is through the Instagram I just acquired. Obviously that's even less of an """"achievement"""" than getting someone's phone number, so it's not much to go by, but unless she's blind or deaftone she's well aware that I like her, or at least that I have some interest in her (jokes and giggles by friends when I briefly get the chance to talk with her - to her amusement - don't help either), so a message wouldn't be too far out of the question, I hope.

I'm thinking of waiting 'til she comes back, see her during one of the two day's she's going to be present and ask her how her holidays went, alongside the typical constrained-by-time small talk.

Then, I'd just send her a message saying ""hey, since your finals are over and I'm basically jobless 'til I move abroad in 1+ month, how about going out for a coffee sometime?"" or something of that sorts. If she's in any way interested, or even intrigued, she wouldn't refuse. If she does, c'est la vie.

What do y'all think? Obviously I am overthinking about this but I need to hear actual human opinions.",1,1766250261.0,datingadviceformen,3,1.0,False

- Something funny: a gift with a pun, something that'll make the recipient laugh, dad jokes are obviously great for dads or anyone with similar humour

- Something fun: an experience like movie tickets, concert tickets, a trip to the zoo or other places the recipient might enjoy 

- Something tasty: a classic if you don't know the person very well. My go-to is a box of chocolates or a big bag of sweets. A bottle of alcohol is also great if you think the person would enjoy it (I've personally bought a fancy bottle of beer for a loved one)

- Wearables: Don't know their size but want to give them something to wear? Funny or comfy socks are great (and the size is easier to estimate), gloves or a winter hat for cold climates, maybe a scarf

- Skincare: a good option for a lot of people. If you don't know their skin type a body lotion (which doesn't go on the face) might be preferred, hand lotion or a good lip balm 

- Candles: some hate them, others love them. LED candles are great for those afraid of fire or with curious pets around. Scented candles are also a classic; aim for sweet or floral scents if you don't know them well 

- Hobbies: if you don't know much about them go for something that doesn't require a lot of skill or expensive accessories like jigsaw puzzles, adult colouring books, perhaps a boardgame, a video game (if they already have a PC or console), a nice journal (maybe with a set of stickers or a good pen), etc.

- Comfort items: tea/coffee, hot chocolate, blankets, fuzzy socks, a book (if you have an idea of what they like), fidget toys, hair clips (if the recipient tends to use them)

- The obvious: gift cards, money, gift boxes or baskets from various retailers

- Miscellaneous: homemade presents, vinyls/CDs/DVDs (if they use them), baked goods, a subscription to something, a vase for flowers, an upgrade for something they already own (electric toothbrush, a fancy hairbrush, high quality towels, etc.), trinkets (could be decor, collectables or blind boxes)

I stayed at the Riggs (also Edit) last visit to DC and that was a phenomenal stay. Flawless hospitality, great value with all the Edit benefits and a truly beautiful hotel. Fun speakeasy cocktail bar in the downstairs bank vault.

The Dupont Circle was hard to turn down - after 10,000 points it was $77 for the night.

They “upgraded” me from a luxury King to apparently a super deluxe luxury King - those nuances were lost on me. Complimentary macaron cookies and a sparkling water were in the room.

Room was entirely adequate and seemed standard. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was drafty (it was cold out). Room was INCREDIBLY noisy - I can’t overstate that. Heard neighbors hanging their clothes in the closet and all the street noise. So much street noise. The bedside clock alarm went off at 6 AM which, though no fault of the hotel, left me salty.

I used my $100 credit for a martini, caesar salad and fries at the bar and for a morning coffee. I skipped breakfast despite their offering $45/person towards that meal.

It’s a very nice hotel with a lovely lobby in a great location but it was SO loud that I’d choose the Riggs again and again for another brief stay. For $77 all in though? Solid.

1prizr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1prizr7/short_story_i_just_wrote/,Short story I just wrote,"I was reading Young Hearts Crying this morning and had this urge to write something. I've always wanted to take a stab at it, but never really did it. Just wanted to share it somewhere. Criticism is welcome, but it's not really something I'm pursuing, just felt good to finally write my first story. Oh and by the way, did my best to make it sound natural, but English is not my first language.

\-------

There is nothing particularly noteworthy about this neighborhood. Sure, it has its fair share of nice houses, but nothing spectacular. A nice lawn here, a fancy wooden staircase there. An old house that could definitely use a bit of fixing up, with an expensive looking SUV in the garage. Standard stuff.

Still, at any given crossroads you might find some interesting looking places.

Take the one with the stone walls, for example. A young couple lives there, no kids yet. The woman seems to spend all day inside, maybe she works from home, maybe she's a housewife. On Wednesdays, at 9 in the morning, she does leave the house, wearing yoga pants and a black shirt. Knowing there's a Pilates studio within walking distance, I bet that's where she goes.

Aside from Pilates, she seems to only show up when an older woman is visiting, presumably her mother. They do some gardening together, meaning the young one tends to the plants while the mother chews the ear off of anyone who would listen through the gate.

They do have nice plants, but what steals the show is the large tree right by their garage. I was never one to know the names of plants and flowers, but I know this tree has white flowers, and I know it's beautiful. It does make a mess on the sidewalk, but oh well.

The wife is harmless enough, but the husband... there's no better way to describe this man other than he has a very, and I mean a very punchable face. You could go forever without ever talking to him and still know with all your heart that he's an arrogant little bastard. There's no helping it, he was just unfortunate enough to be born with a face that makes it clear beyond any shadow of a doubt that he's completely insufferable.

It's not like I have any hard evidence. He never did me any wrong. The worst thing I've ever seen him do is have his music a little too loud over the weekend, while he sits on a beach chair on the lawn and spends way too much time on his phone. But boy, does he look stupid while doing it.

Opposite the stone walled house lives this guy in his early forties. He seems to live alone, but every once in a while a teenage girl spends some days with him. Divorced parent is my guess. And as long as we're guessing, he's either unemployed, retired or a drug dealer. The man washes his car on a Wednesday afternoon, has parties that last almost until dawn and has way too many people coming and going from his place. At least he doesn't invoke any face-punching urges.

That leaves us with two houses left. One of which has been vacant for three months now, and the last one houses another young couple.

They both look to be in their late twenties, both spend all day inside just like the pilates woman. But today, since it's the weekend, they're not working. Oh no, they're fighting. 

Fighting might not be the best word to describe their situation, this is more like the aftermath of a fight that lasted for years. It's been going on for so long that neither of them really cares to fight any more. They've accepted their situation. 

Of course, it wasn't always like this. There was a time, like any young love, in which weekends offered much nicer activities than complaining about character traits so deeply ingrained that changing them was well beyond hope.

There was a time they'd not even be awake until noon. Friday night was reserved for sharing songs they loved with each other, while cooking a nice romantic dinner and tasting craft beer that cost more than they could afford on the wages of a marketing intern and a failed guitar teacher. But somehow they always managed to make ends meet while having these little luxuries.

They used to have dreams. A trip to Italy, a nice big house with a big backyard, lots of kids and big sunday family lunches.

Sitting on the couch, the man found it hard to remember all those good times after fighting for so long. Still he tried harder and harder. He remembered how he felt alright, enough to give him some hope. Maybe they could make things right. Maybe they could go to Italy after all. And they did get the house. Not where they wanted, not as big as they wanted, but a house nonetheless. Maybe if they spent more time making it look nice instead of finding flaws in each other they'd have a better chance of making it.

He thought of this one time they got some cheap wood and made a funny looking cabinet. It wobbled if you put more than a feather on it and the screws were way too long, but that cabinet was with them through three different homes.

They had more space now, and a lot more free time, maybe they could give it another shot. He looked around the living room and started having ideas. The TV console was fine enough, but it had no personality. They could make a wider one that spanned the whole length of the wall, with enough space for decorations but also as a way to hide all those cords she hated so much. Maybe put some nicer shelves on the wall too, hang some plants. Then again, that wall didn't get enough light, maybe photographs would be a better choice for decor.

A coffee table might be nice too. They always brought chairs over to the couch to put some snacks on while watching a movie. Functional enough, but maybe a dedicated table would be better.

And that's just in the living room. Outside there was a lot they could do. There's this weird corner right by the hammock, a nice little sitting area would do fine here. Throw in some built in storage and that solves the never ending problem of where to put the loose gardening tools.

Yes, they could definitely do that. Sure, they were a little strapped for cash this month, but next month for sure. All they needed was some wood, his dad would surely lend him all the tools he needed. 

He got up ready to tell her all his great ideas for the house, looking up from the floor for the first time in what seemed like an hour.

She was just about to leave the bedroom, with a suitcase in her hand.

""I called my parents, they're picking me up in 30 minutes.""

Well that was yesterday. Today is Sunday, and by the smell of it, Mr. Punchable Face is having a barbecue.

1prizq6,https://www.wired.com/story/scammers-in-china-are-using-ai-generated-images-to-get-refunds/,Scammers in China Are Using AI-Generated Images to Get Refunds,"**From dead crabs to shredded bed sheets, fraudsters are using fake photos and videos to get their money back from ecommerce sites.**

I don’t want to admit it, but I did spend a lot of money online this holiday shopping season. And unsurprisingly, some of those purchases didn’t meet my expectations. A photobook I bought was damaged in transit, so I snapped a few pictures, emailed them to the merchant, and got a refund. Online shopping platforms have long depended on photos submitted by customers to confirm that refund requests are legitimate. But [generative AI](https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence) is now starting to break that system.

# A Pinch Too Suspicious

On the Chinese [social media app RedNote](https://www.wired.com/story/red-note-tiktok-xiaohongshu/), WIRED found at least a dozen posts from ecommerce sellers and customer service representatives complaining about allegedly AI-generated refund claims they’ve received. In one case, a customer complained that the bed sheet they purchased was torn to pieces, but the Chinese characters on the shipping label looked like gibberish. In another, the buyer sent a picture of a coffee mug with cracks that looked like paper tears. “This is a ceramic cup, not a cardboard cup. Who could tear apart a ceramic cup into layers like this?” the seller wrote.

The merchants reported that there are a few product categories where AI-generated damage photos are being abused the most: [fresh groceries](https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/trending-china/article/3334109/china-consumers-use-ai-alter-product-photos-claim-refunds-goods-appear-damaged), [low-cost beauty products](https://jingdaily.com/posts/ai-fraud-hits-china-e-commerce), and fragile items like ceramic cups. Sellers often don’t ask customers to return these goods before issuing a refund, making them more prone to return scams.

In November, a merchant who sells live crabs on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, received a photo from a customer that made it look like most of the crabs she bought arrived already dead, while two others had escaped. The buyer even sent videos showing the dead crabs being poked by a human finger. But something was off.

“My family has farmed crabs for over 30 years. We’ve never seen a dead crab whose legs are pointing up,” Gao Jing, the seller, said in a video she later posted on Douyin. But what ultimately gave away the con was the sexes of the crabs. There were two males and four females in the first video, while the second clip had three males and three females. One of them also had nine instead of eight legs.

Gao later reported the fraud to the police, who determined the videos were indeed fabricated and detained the buyer for eight days, according to a police notice Gao shared online. The case drew widespread attention on Chinese social media, in part because it was the first known AI refund scam of its kind to trigger a regulatory response.

# Lowering Barriers

This problem isn’t unique to China. Forter, a New York-based fraud detection company, estimates that AI-doctored images used in refund claims have increased by more than 15 percent since the start of the year, and are continuing to rise globally.

“This trend started in mid-2024, but has accelerated over the past year as image-generation tools have become widely accessible and incredibly easy to use.” says Michael Reitblat, CEO and cofounder of Forter. He adds that the AI doesn’t have to get everything right, as frontline retail workers and refund review teams may not have the time to closely scrutinize each picture.

Reitblat says organized crime groups are using the same tactics as individuals to orchestrate refund fraud at scale. In one case, he says, scammers submitted over a million dollars worth of refund claims using AI-altered images that showed cracks or dents in various home goods. The requests were submitted in a tight time window, seemingly to overwhelm the system, and the fraudsters also used rotating IP addresses to conceal their identity.

Some sellers are using AI to fight back against AI. A Chinese toy seller demonstrated to WIRED how they feed refund requests to an AI chatbot to analyze if the photos are doctored. But these tools are far from perfect right now. Plus, even with supposed confirmation from a chatbot, ecommerce platforms won’t necessarily always side with the seller. Reitblat warns that retailers might eventually respond by tightening their return policies, but that would hurt the shopping experience of customers acting in good faith.

This story echoes an earlier backlash that happened on Chinese digital marketplaces, when sellers were the ones being criticized for using AI-generated product photos. Shoppers complained that buying online had become like gambling, and you never knew if the product that arrived would actually look like the pictures.

But really, these trends are two sides of the same problem: Ecommerce relies heavily on trust, and widespread availability of AI is making it increasingly difficult to operate under the assumption that the majority of people are honest actors. Existing guardrails, like [AI watermarks](https://www.wired.com/story/china-wants-to-make-ai-watermarks-happen/), are often too easy to remove. If shopping platforms want systems built for humans to keep working, they’ll need to figure out how to respond, whether with new verification rules, revised refund policies, or better accountability mechanisms for AI-enabled scams.

I was put on liquid carafate which absolutely destroyed my stomach. I decided to try and “ fix “ myself. I lived on homemade vegetable soups plus slice of organic sourdough bread with a little avocado and feta cheese , 3 times a day. Soup- roasted squash, courgettes, beetroot, and a little sweet red peppers with a little olive oil and salt to taste. Roast until soft and juicy. Purée in blender with chicken bone broth ( store bought) and heat until warm. Keep the rest in fridge. I make it every two days

Have been  using mix of slippery elm powder ( 1 heaped tsp) , marshmallow root two capsules, and quarter tsp of creatine in warm water , well shook first thing in the morning and again at night. Also Dgl chewable tabs when I feel I needed them. Two zinc L- carnosine , two S. Boulardii probiotics, and 2/3 organic turmeric capsules with food in morning taken with a little warm water. Also half tsp of fennel seeds after food ( this really helped) Before bed 1dessert spoon of gaviscon ADVANCE.  And sometimes another during the night.

I have drank only warm water, ginger/ turmeric tea and fennel tea. And have had matcha green tea in last week.

I have got to like my routine. Soups are yummy and filling. 5 weeks on, I went for an endoscopy yesterday to be told everything was clear. H pylori negative ( I had used mastic gum capsule 2500mg per day) That was the only Christmas present I wanted ❤️

1prizjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBCareerMentorship/comments/1prizjv/why_we_hire_from_target_schools_its_not_just/,"Why we hire from ""Target"" schools (it's not just prestige)","I see a lot of posts on Reddit debating ""Target"" vs. ""Non-Target"" schools. If you’re at a non-target, it feels like unfair elitism. If you’re in high school, it feels like just another ranking list to stress over.

I’m a Managing Director at a middle-market bank and the author of *Crack the Street*. I want to pull back the curtain and tell you exactly why we care so much about your school.

It isn’t just about prestige or being a snob. It’s about efficiency.

**The Economics of Hiring** Investment banks are businesses with limited time. If I need to hire 10 analysts, I know that if I go to a ""Core"" school (Wharton, UVA, Michigan, Harvard, etc.), I can find 50 qualified candidates in a single afternoon. These students have been prepping for technicals since freshman year and have a finance club drilling them on mock interviews.

At a non-core school? I have to dig through 1,000 resumes to find the same 50 qualified people. We simply don't have the time to do that. That’s why ""School Teams"" exist. We go where the path of least resistance is.

**The Cheat Sheet** If you are still in high school or looking to transfer, choosing a college is your first investment decision. You aren't just buying an education; you are buying a recruiting pipeline.

While every bank is different, here are the usual suspects where we actively hunt for talent. If you go here, the recruiters come to you.

* **The Ivies:** Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Penn (Wharton), Yale.
* **Private Elites:** Duke, Georgetown, MIT, NYU (Stern), Northwestern, Stanford, UChicago.
* **Public Powerhouses:** These schools place massive volume because their alumni networks are fiercely loyal. Berkeley (Haas), Michigan (Ross), UNC (Kenan-Flagler), UT Austin (McCombs), UVA (McIntire).

Note: This isn't an exhaustive list. Places like Indiana (Kelley), Notre Dame, and others place incredibly well too.

**So what if you aren't at one of these schools?** Can you still break in? **Absolutely.** I hire non-target kids all the time.

But you need to understand the trade-off: **You have to work 10x harder.** You don't have an on-campus interview schedule. You have to cold email. You have to hustle for every single coffee chat. You have to force your way into the process because the system is designed to ignore you.

**My advice:**

1. **High Schoolers:** Ignore US News rankings. Look at *placement reports*. Go where the banks go. A degree from a big state target school is often worth more for banking recruiting than a ""prestigious"" liberal arts degree with no alumni on the Street.
2. **College Students:** If you aren't at a target, stop relying on the online portal. Your resume will die there. You need to network aggressively with alumni from your school (or just random bankers) to bypass the HR screen.

Happy to answer questions in the comments about school selection or how to pivot if you're at a non-core school.

I’m 19. I’m at my absolute limit.

My father has controlled and belittled me my whole life. At 16, I was kicked out. I built a life, met a great girl, and then suddenly had to flee my home country, losing everything.

My father helped me to move in another country, when I can’t stay in my home country legally. That's when the real trap was set. He decided to start a business - two coffee shops, with one in my name for legal reasons. Crucially, I never agreed to this. I never wanted to run a coffee shop. It was his idea, his push, his decision. I just wanted to run out of my home country with my girlfriend. But now, the narrative has been rewritten: everyone, especially him, claims this was my dream, my idea, and therefore all the problems are my fault.

I am the sole worker: barista, accountant, manager, everything. 7 days a week, 14 hours of work, no days off, no salary. My girlfriend is here too, working for food. Every minor mistake is met with screams that I'm a useless, worthless failure who ruined ""my own"" business. He expanded to a second, failing location and now says I'm personally in debt for it.

After 5 months of working like this I'm dangerously underweight and can't sleep normally, I feel nothing. No love for my girlfriend, no joy, no hope. I'm numb.

Suicidal thoughts are my only respite. The idea of not existing is a quiet comfort. I'm too exhausted to act, but the thought is always there.

When he saw my physical decline, he accused me of being a drug addict. He’s just like: 

Hmm… My son is dying for my business after I forcing him to work without any rest for 7 days a week without any money and all he receives for it is indignity? Well he is 100% on drugs👍. 

I have never used drugs in my life.

He is a great manipulator. When he that I’m at my limit he playing a “good father” and saying me that I need to work less and that he have a health problems (he is not have health problems) But after I saying to him that I will take a rest he says: nah, you will work every day without any rest. I have a lots of situations like this. Just don’t want to make a big post.

My escape plan is simple: vanish.

I have a residency permit for this country pending. Once I get it, I will walk away. I won't try to sell ""my"" shop or take any money. I will leave everything and just try to disappear from his life.

I can work 7 days a week and do all this job, but when I finish my job I want to get to place where I can talk with my friends and my gf, where I can just rest without hearing about how useless am I. I just want patience in my life, just want to live or finally die.

Last time I feel very bad, I almost don’t eat, I feel physically pain and I think I will die earlier than I could run away from him.

Why I might be the AH:

He helped me relocate when I was vulnerable. Now, if I disappear, he'll be left alone in a foreign country with two businesses he can't run, facing total ruin. The guilt is crushing. I'm being made to feel like I'm destroying the very project I ""wanted,"" even though I never did.

Reposting my reply here as there may be others in a similar situation and this might be useful. 

IF you are someone who's come to realize - perhaps after a ED rejection and taking a fresh look at it - that your personal statement just isn't working or is cringe ---

Do NOT panic - or give up.

It's actually great that you realized the “clever” format /metaphor / screenplay etc you spent months building isn’t landing. It feels forced. You fell in love with it and hence it blindsided you from realizing this. This clarity could literally save your application.

The good news: It is NOT too late. Two weeks is an eternity. One single focused weekend is honestly enough to write a great Personal Statement— just needs FOCUS - stop trying to be “unique” and start being sincere.

Kill your current essay completely. Do NOT try to fix it.

Delete the gimmick. Open a blank doc.  Choose a real moment, or a story in your life.. that’s actually personal or meaningful. Not “saving the world.”  Not ""seeing my grandmother go through Alzheimer's"". Avoid such cliches. Something unique to your life. The goal is to not impress the AO /reader but talking to them.  It doesn't need to be a literary masterpiece or metaphorically rich - this isn't a writing contest. Use this simple litmus test. When a stranger reads your essay, will he think:

“I would actually love to sit in a coffee shop and talk to this person for an hour.” 

That’s it.

* Pilot Metropolitan M
* LAMY Safari B
* TWSBI ECO B
* Kaweco Sport BB

I've found the Pilots to have the perfect sweet spot for me and always write beautifully, but I also like the broader nib of the LAMY Safari B for journaling.  The Pilot Metropolitan has a bit of shading, but shading really shines on those broader nibs which I love.  Something like colorverse coffee break in the LAMY is perfect to me.  At first I did feel like the LAMY had a narrower sweet spot, but that was early in my fountain pen journey and I seem to have adjusted to it by now.

I don't have large hands, but I prefer to not post my pens.  The exception being the Kaweco Sport since it is pretty short.

Yes, mastering Duolingo is cool. But have you ever shared a meaningful silence with someone while a street cat judges your pronunciation? That’s fluency.

# About Me & My Linguistic Chaos:

- 27 | 180cm of expressive limbs (my hand gestures during conversation could qualify as a full-body language).
- Brain OS: AuDHD. I absorb languages at 2x speed and forget basic nouns at 0.5x speed. My thoughts are organized like a browser with 47 tabs open in 3 different alphabets.
- Literary Vibe: “I am a sick man… but I also taught myself how to curse colorfully in Levantine Arabic.” (Dostoevsky, if he had a Notes app full of memes and verb conjugation charts).
- Functionally poetic, but in a “I’ll book a last-minute flight to cope and then try to order coffee in the local dialect” kind of way.
- Voice calls are non-negotiable. My brain works best in audio chaos. Prepare for accidental poetry, dramatic Middle Eastern expressions, and moments where I forget the word for “spoon” in English but vividly describe it in Arabic.

# What’s On Offer (The Levantine Arabic Experience):

I offer native Levantine Arabic  vibe. Not the formal, textbook kind, but the living, breathing, chaotic version. Learn the language of:

- Poetic curses that sound like blessings.
- Overly dramatic expressions for everyday things (“I would die for you!” = “Thanks for the tea.”).
- The secret, heartfelt meanings behind “yalla” and “inshallah.”
- The cultural subtext behind every raised eyebrow and tongue click.
- How to argue lovingly about who pays the bill (a national sport).

# You Might Be My Person If You’re A Native Speaker Of:

- English – and you’re cool with gently roasting my grammar while I teach you how to sound like a local.
- Russian – and you appreciate a similar level of melodic despair and soulful bluntness in conversation. Let’s trade existential phrases.
- Chinese (Mandarin) – and you understand the beauty of a tonal language; I’ll match your discipline with my chaotic energy.

# What I’m Looking For (The Unhinged Language Exchange):

A long-term co-conspirator in mutual linguistic ruin. I want to start with voice notes arguing about why ‘habibi’ is the most versatile word on earth and end up practicing small talk over a questionable but delicious 3am kebab.

I am chronically authentic (read: I have no indoor voice). I believe language lives in intonation, interruption, and chaotic overlap.

Let’s build a shared Google Doc of glorious mistranslations. Let’s send each other terrible voice memos singing cheesy songs in our target languages. Let’s be confidently incorrect together.

# Topics We Can Overthink in Two Languages:

Nihilism in noun forms, Absurdism in grammar rules, Why We’re All Just Slightly Evolved Monkeys With Language-Based Anxiety, AI Translation Fails, Biohacking our accents, and whether pigeons have regional dialects.

# The Bottom Line:

If you’re a self-aware language nerd / disaster human with a soft center, a dark sense of humor, and the patience to hear me passionately explain Arab proverbs—let’s talk.

I promise to make our impending linguistic crises fun, loud, and filled with emotional hand gestures.

P.S. This post is a beautiful dumpster fire of intent, but I’ve decorated it with fairy lights and the hopeful ghost of fluency. 🎇

P.P.S. Voice chat is mandatory. I will bribe you with funny anecdotes, existential musings in Arabic, and the authentic sound of me trying to direct a taxi driver in your target language.

This isn't a pity post. I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm not saying “woe is me.” I'm saying: **something is seriously, systemically fucked -- and Portland just happens to be a perfect petri dish for it.**

**The vibe on the street**

People are *closed*. Not shy -- **closed.**

Eyes down. Headphones in. Phones glowing like emotional pacifiers. You can walk past a hundred people and feel like you're moving through NPCs waiting for a dialogue tree that never opens.

Coffee shops? Silent monasteries of MacBooks and AirPods.
Bars? Groups already sealed shut like Tupperware.
Events? Everyone “here with friends,” which now apparently means “do not perceive me.”

There's this low-grade social frost everywhere. Not hostility -- just **absence.**

**The apps (good lord, the apps)**

Dating apps deserve their own war crimes tribunal.

They've trained us to:

- Treat humans like inventory

- Confuse attraction with dopamine

- Outsource courage to an algorithm

- And reject people faster than we’d reject spam calls


Everyone is “talking to someone,” which usually means:

- A half-dead thread

- With someone they'll never meet

- While swiping for someone “better”

- Forever


We've built a system where **no one feels chosen,** only “temporarily selected.”

And then we're shocked that nobody shows up open, curious, or warm in real life.

**About me (because honesty matters)**

I'm not writing this as some dude who never leaves the house.

I talk to people. I work nights. I meet travelers. I've lived other places. I'm emotionally literate enough to know when something is *me* -- and when it's the water we're all swimming in.

I'm not afraid of rejection. I'm afraid of **irrelevance** -- of living in a culture where even trying to connect feels intrusive.

Where showing interest feels like breaking an unspoken rule.

Where everyone wants connection, intimacy, warmth, sex, partnership -- ...but only if it arrives frictionless, pre-approved, and without risk.

That's not how humans work. That’s how **apps** work.

**Portland isn't the disease**

Portland is just small enough that you can't hide from the pattern.

This feels bigger. National. Maybe global.

A generation raised on:

- Infinite choice

- Constant comparison

- Social anxiety dressed up as “boundaries”

- And the quiet belief that something better is one swipe away


So nobody commits. Nobody risks. Nobody looks up.

**The cost**

The cost isn't just “dating is hard.”

The cost is:

- Loneliness dressed as independence

- Hyper-individualism pretending to be self-care

- A city full of good, interesting, attractive people...
...who never meet each other


We are **touch-starved, attention-starved,** and weirdly proud of it.

**This isn't anti-women. It's anti-bullshit.**

Women didn't create this alone. Men didn't either.
Tech did. Incentives did. Fear did. Convenience did.

And now we're all sitting around wondering why everything feels flat and disconnected.

**So what now?**

I don't have a tidy solution. Reddit loves those. Life doesn't.

But maybe it starts with:

- Looking up

- Talking anyway

- Letting things be awkward

- Remembering that chemistry doesn't live in a profile

- And accepting that connection requires risk, not optimization


If this resonates, it's not because Portland is uniquely terrible.

This isn't a question and it's not up for debate.
It’s obvious.
We all feel it.

About C Squared Social \
\
We are a full-service digital marketing agency for businesses of all sizes, offering paid advertising, content marketing, website development, photo/video and graphic design services. Diverse portfolio of B2B and B2C clients in sectors including healthcare, retail, finance, food and beverage, transportation, etc. We have also been included as one of Inc 5000 fastest growing companies in the US.\
Role Overview\
As a Google Media Buyer, you’ll lead performance across Search, YouTube, and Performance Max. You’ll architect campaigns from the ground up with an analytical mindset, managing both structure and strategy to drive profitable outcomes.\
\
This isn’t a maintenance position—it’s a technical and analytical role requiring mastery of data interpretation, attribution modeling, and revenue optimization. You’ll diagnose why campaigns perform the way they do, build solutions, and collaborate cross-functionally to influence creative, landing pages, and conversion flow.\
Key Responsibilities\
\
 	Own campaign architecture and strategy across Search, YouTube, Display, and Performance Max.\
 	Conduct deep analysis across metrics and dimensions (search term, device, time, location, audience, keyword, creative, landing page).\
 	Implement and optimize bidding automation strategies (Max Conversions, tROAS, tCPA) based on performance data.\
 	Use data segmentation and query mining to eliminate wasted spend and isolate high-intent traffic.\
 	Partner with analytics to refine attribution modeling (GA4, Data Studio, Looker) and integrate with cross-channel dashboards.\
 	Drive incrementality testing and interpret data beyond last-click attribution.\
 	Optimize Performance Max asset groups, analyzing audience signal performance, video engagement, and product feed data.\
 	Oversee tracking infrastructure—conversion tags, enhanced conversions, offline imports, and CRM integration.\
 	Collaborate with CRO and Creative teams to test messaging, page flow, and ad/LP congruence.\
 	Produce weekly insight reports that explain why performance changed, what caused it, and how it will be fixed or scaled.\
 	Other duties as assigned.\
\
What Success Looks Like\
\
 	You don’t just hit CPA and ROAS goals—you engineer the path to them.\
 	You can trace the root cause of performance shifts down to campaign, audience, or time-of-day level.\
 	You implement testing structures that drive incremental and compounding improvements.\
 	You’re recognized internally as the agency’s Google performance expert and strategic operator.\
\
Benefits (effective the first of the month after hire):\
\
 	Medical, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance\
 	401(k) with Company match\
 	Three (3) weeks of vacation\
 	Flexible 8 hour work day (7:00a-7:00p)\
 	Hybrid – 4 days in/1 day work-from-home\
 	Snack and coffee bar\
 	Corporate gym discount\
 	Complimentary use of bird scooters for in-office or coffee runs\
\
C Squared Social is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.\
Requirements:\
Required Skills & Experience\
\
 	5+ years of hands-on Google Ads experience across Search, YouTube, and Performance Max.\
 	Proven track record managing $500K+/month in performance budgets.\
 	Expert in:\
\
 	Google Ads Editor & Experiments\
 	GA4, Tag Manager, and enhanced conversions setup\
 	Attribution models (data-driven, position-based, linear)\
 	Query analysis, keyword sculpting, and audience layering\
 	YouTube audience segmentation & creative optimization\
\
\
 	Strong analytical skillset—comfortable building pivot tables, calculated fields, and data models in Sheets or Looker.\
 	Experience identifying cross-platform attribution impact (Google - Meta - CTV).\
 	Advanced understanding of bid algorithms, auction dynamics, and ad rank mechanics.\
 	Obsessed with metrics—constantly asking why performance changes and validating insights with data.\
\
Education:\
\
 	Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience.\
\

The nephrologist I work with had patient rounds this week Wednesday-Friday. Doctor comes in visibly sick without a mask, says he had a fever the day before and that morning. He puts a mask on to round with patients and tells them he has “a bug” but takes his mask off in the clinic around staff. I have a good relationship with this doctor and tell him I hope he feels better, but I don’t want to be sick, especially right before Christmas and head to my office. He’s still walking around the clinic with no mask on coughing, sneezing, and blowing his nose and coming to my office to talk. He’s a pretty easy going guy and at one point fake sneezes on a patient (while masked) bc he joked with him and said he didn’t believe he was sick. I needed him to sign paperwork and he gave it back to me trying to touch me with them (and jokingly infect me). He even joked around about going to the break room to get coffee and “infecting the keurig”. Yesterday he comes in and says “I feel better, but I don’t know if it’s enough to not get you sick.” I’m literally just in awe of the carelessness of this man and have completely lost respect for him as a doctor. Anyway, I woke up this morning with my head pounding and sneezing and I know he got me sick. He said he didn’t test for anything but admits he was exposed to flu, covid, and rhinovirus from rounding in the hospital.

When I first got it, it made a lovely thick foam, which was the reason I bought one (a hotel I stayed in had one in the room & I got hooked). Over the past couple of weeks, however, I've noticed that the foam... Sucks.  It disappears quickly and has big bubbles that pop instead of the thick foam. I called the helpline and the agent suggested that I clean it (...again?)

Hey you, its 7 am, I slept in. It's exceptionally cold, a hard frost has covered everything in a veil of white. Crystalline structures glisten with the morning sun, twinkling like your eyes.

As I started to crumple newspapers that B brought for the fire, I noticed an article, more a picture, your face graced a page. I was intrigued. I was cold. 

The fire can wait.

I wanted to set the pages ablaze, letting the corners curl, watch the ink turn black. Yet I was drawn to sit, coffee in hand to read this tale. A story that holds weight, promise and stability, not for me, for others. A story of strong women in the community that are larger than life.

Yielding strength as if it were simple. 

Story over and with reluctance, I continued to crumple the pages, to set them to blaze.
Turning your memory into smoke. 

I wept as the pages changed, the wood starting to carry its presence.  

The heat has become comfort.

I would be wrong to say that you don't occupy my thoughts, because you do. Our time was short, a time that was ripped from us both. I would hit rewind, if I could. 

Fate wasn't fair.

The furry kids have sought comfort from the stove's soothing warmth, one that I imagined you have in your heart. Not freely given. Not to be taken for granted. You possess grace.

As I stare into the forest, I will not be remiss to the duties I must perform, ones I have charted, furthering this homestead's evolution for me and these two furry kids.

Be well, my palindrome girl, if I get lost in the forest, will you come find me?

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

I have been chasing waves for many months at a time in my life. 
Chasing that feeling, being free.

I never settled near the ocean. 
I chose Montreal.

Yes, I snowboard, I love powder.
I love my good coffee, I love my city life.

Would I became salty about tourists? 
Would I appreciate it as much as right now after many years? 

That, I will never know.

I recently went through a breakup because my ex was depressed and got overwhelmed by the idea of a relationship (we’re basically the same person mentally, it was spooky how similar we were)

I’ve left her alone for a few weeks now, but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns and how I showed up in our relationship and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety? 

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I refused to let her, it just made me too uncomfortable! And every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from our holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation and see if she’s interested in getting coffee, but I feel like I ruined everything by not being brave enough to accept what she was giving me.
