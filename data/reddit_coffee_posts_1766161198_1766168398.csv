We have three househelps - J does cleaning, S makes food and does dusting and A takes care of my grandma who suffers from dementia. A also sometimes helps S around the house as my grandma is physically active and does not require as much help except for some supervision. S had taken a leave for a month due to her surgery but it turned to two months as she had some complications with it. The burden of doing S's tasks fell on A during this time but we helped her out in most of her tasks. 

A is a single mom who left her abusive husband and her family also kicked her out of their home as a guy killed himself for her in front of their house. We sympathised with her and gave her the job. At noon, she brings her daughter from school to our house and the daughter stays at our house till A finishes her work. The daughter (8yo) has also made a friend group with kids similar her age in our locality. Her husband and they tried to reconcile but it didn't work out. The husband even involved my mom to solve their marital problems and showed up at our house. He talked about A talking with other men but we didn't give it any thought as the guy was an alcoholic and abusive asshole.



**Problem:**

During these two months, most of my **stuff keeps breaking and only my stuff** \- coffee tumbler, glass bottle, iPad screen, glass jar, ramen bowl, etc. 

But this isn't the crazy part. We have a three storey house, with the second floor given on rent and the first floor along with ground floor with us. Sometimes, A goes to the first floor to do the dusting. However, since the past two months **random poop is being found undrained in our washroom**. A is always the one who finds it. We tried checking our sewage system but it still happened again. A total of 3 times. We suspected our tenants as they have a lot of people visiting them. Their lease is also almost up. Also, our first floor is usually unlocked (our mistake). We also questioned A but she denied it vehemently (ofc). However, it did not make any sense for A to do so. 

My other grandma (we are a joint family) was always suspicious of her. Recently, my other grandma's **1000 rupees went missing** from her purse when she kept it unattended for 15 minutes. She accused A however she denied it. The thing is only A and my grandma who has dementia were present there. 

A gets a **lot of calls from unknown number**. I have found her numerous times talking to some man on the call. My dad also found her on a video call with some dude just as she was leaving our house. The main issue is my parents come home late. Usually its just me, A and my grandma who has dementia. I am kind of scared that one of these guys might show up at our house. 

We've been arguing a lot at our home because of her. She is very intuitive and clever. Eg: Two days ago, my mom was giving my grandma her meds and A randomly said why are you giving her 3 pills when you're only supposed to give her one (she was wrong). We have rarely given my grandma any meds in front of her.

My parents don't want to kick her out. What should I do?",1,1766168026.0,india,0,0.99,False

## The Naked Wine approach on a 12-year-old laptop

This is a **TRUE Green Profile** – a way to escape Microsoft’s ""knife to the throat"" and their bottomless greed. It is time to finally put those old laptops, mini-PCs, and Windows boxes to good use again.

Prepare for **TRUE LINUX FREEDOM**. This is how you play games on Linux without the complexity of Lutris, Steam, or other tangled runners.

### The Journey Begins

I have spent days in an endless battle with layers and runners in Lutris, trying to make the most of my hardware. I started with a Voyo i7, which was a fair starting point for a Linux learning journey. Taking that experience, I turned my attention to an even older beast: a Samsung NP370R5E from late 2013.

Equipped with an Intel HD4000 and a Radeon 8750M, I simply installed the Wine framework (Naked Wine), configured the parameters, and built a handful of bash scripts.

The breakthrough happened this morning. While making a lunchbox for my youngest daughter on her last day of school before Christmas, enjoying a cup of coffee and a freshly baked Lussekatt, I set up the environment for:

**“The Lord of the Rings Online” (LotRO)**.

With fantastic scenery and nice gameplay in many various ways to enjoy and embark on a journey somewhat like Bilbo Baggins “There and back again”

Here is my revolution in simple words and screenshots to prove what i am trying to learn you something worth trying out on a Bootable USB Stick with your Linux Distro of choice and once you are finished with the Live Setup of Linux, just get the device up on the best internet connection you can provide, preferably with a cable connection, but a decent wifi does the thing too. Lotro - short for “The Lord of The Rings Online mmorpg” called lotro from here on!

This voyage could begin with a Bootable USB Stick with a Linux distro of your choice and just install and get online, preferably with cable to get quick access to the servers, but a decent WiFi will do for most of you.

When your newly installed Linux is finished with Live Setup rebooted without the usb-stick in place and is confirmed ONLINE just start here and follow these simple steps to find out why on earth no one has never done this before!



Have a nice trip ya all <3

### Part 2: The Technical Revolution – Taming the 12-Year-Old Beast

To make this old Samsung perform like a modern gaming station, we stripped away the ""scripted nonsense"" and went straight to the hardware.

#### 1. The Power of ""Naked Wine"" and Selective Hardware

https://preview.redd.it/e7mt2ky4c78g1.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=d511b02f9dae908350851bac30ef12f4bf6fb6b5

*The Brain of the Operation: My custom Bash script. This demonstrates how I force the system to utilize the Radeon GPU using DRI\_PRIME=1, bypassing heavy runners for a pure, native-like gaming experience.* 



### 

#### 2. Visual Quality vs. Performance: The ""Golden Standard""

https://preview.redd.it/o9qmvg75c78g1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=355f43990721c30178861bb7a9d5d22cdbaa67d8

Visual Magic with FSR: By running the game at 1024x768 and utilizing Wine's FSR upscaling to 1366x768, we achieve a crisp image without overstressing the 12-year-old CPU.

https://preview.redd.it/jguyex25c78g1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d21f45ca170d58d9b48b2d7e42db0327f796769



#### 3. Solving the ""Impossible"" Store Crash

https://preview.redd.it/jesnr415c78g1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f16c15c06863fa64957b50f7a90dd30b30becd

*Freedom from Crashes: By offloading the LotRO Store to Firefox, we’ve eliminated the main source of Linux instability. Here you see the store running perfectly in an external browser.* 

  


#### 4. Thermal Victory

https://preview.redd.it/80obggz4c78g1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=3075c4070ded9da5cbe15c04dae29d216dd46de3

*Proof of the 'Green Profile': The htop log confirms temperatures holding steady at 66-67°C. We’ve proven that you can play LotRO without jet-engine fan noise or thermal throttling.*

I am in need of Christmas ideas for my partner of 8 years. Budget is $300 CAD. 

He is:

\- 31

\- blue collar 

\- bald (no hair products, already has 3 shavers)

\- owns his own business

\- spends most time at home working on his business or working on job sites (hvac)

\- buys whatever he needs/wants throughout the year

\- bought any tool/table/accessory he could during Covid on marketplace and only buys Milwaukee 

\- does not drink coffee 

\- did not grow up celebrating Christmas so says no gifts

\- already has a heated jacket, boot warmer/dryer, ninja creami and some insulated work gloves coming from my parents/brother

\- he will not receive anything else from his family apart from a gift card around new years so it’s just me and my fam who gift to him

\- he does not; fish (regularly) workout (regularly - though we have a membership) drink, smoke, play video games (regularly) cook, bake, woodwork or craft of any kind, read, play or is interested in sports, does not have a laptop or handheld game player, does not wear pyjamas, slippers, house clothes on any kind, does not care for designer items but does like more accessible brand names (carhartt, wrangler, north face, Patagonia, etc)

\- is very difficult when it comes to comfortable/wide shoes, does not really have a personal style (we need to develop that this year, he just lives in branded work clothes or underwear lol)

\- does not collect anything vintage, rare, cool, etc

\- does not have a personal car currently, only white work van that I’ve already bought organizational things for

\- likes all types of food - is down to try absolutely anything (like this guy would for sure try a wooly mammoth if it ever became available) - he is also slightly caveman-ish but that’s what I love about him lol

The above may sound like a lot but I just want you guys to know there’s not really any current hobbies he’s interested in or wants to get into or any vices (lol) that I can currently support. I hope you guys like a challenge and I will be SO grateful to anyone who has an original/great idea I can use to gift for him.

The preview flashed: “Baby won’t stop screaming—get here.”  

Sender: Manager. 

A baby?

What baby?

My blood ran cold. Manager. The man only handled Nath's scandals and hushed-up messes.

The room stilled. The dinner we'd planned for weeks turning cold between us. And yet he didn't even notice me freezing beside him. 

My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone. I hit Call before I could stop myself.

""Where the he1l have you been?! Listen to that!"" a woman screamed, her breath hitching. ""That's your child crying! You said you'd be here two days ago, Nath! What's the excuse now?""

A baby wailed in the background. Loud. Unrelenting.

My heart splintered. I held the phone away from my ear, but the screaming, the baby's cries, the accusation—all of it still flooded me.

""Is your barren wife still holding you hostage?"" the woman spat. ""I'm done covering for you.""

The voice hit me like a knife.

The phone slipped from my hand, clattering onto the table.  

Nath never looked up from his cold steak.  

That silence was the loudest betrayal of all. 

———————

His silence wrapped around her like barbed wire, tightening with every second.

She picked up her purse. Walked to the door. Opened it.

He didn't stop her.

That was the loudest betrayal of all.

Outside, the night air hit her like a slap, but she welcomed it. At least the cold didn't pretend to love her.

She drove away without looking back.

The next morning, divorce papers were delivered to Nath through lawyers. No note. No explanation. No attempt at closure. Just her signature—a clean, quiet death sentence to their marriage.

And Nath?

He still did nothing.

No calls. No message. No chase. Nothing.

His pride was louder than whatever regret he might have felt.

They had once been music royalty.

A power couple that had the world in their palms—billionaires, superstars, innovators. Their collaborations broke records. Their chemistry ignited stages. Their love story had been sold as a brand, a fantasy, a kingdom.

But after marriage, the kingdom crumbled.

Leone faded into the background one abandoned studio session at a time. Interviews she used to dominate stopped happening. Producers who once begged for her voice slowly turned their attention elsewhere. The industry whispered:

""She's losing her spark."" ""She can't keep up."" ""She peaked early.""

Meanwhile, Nath rose like a god.

Global tours. Stadiums. Chart dominance. His face on billboards stretching across cities. The kind of fame that crushed everything in its way—including her.

The label protected him. The industry worshipped him. And Leone?

She became the quiet wife who couldn't give him a child.

Three years. No baby. No answers. No compassion.

Just silence—heavy, suffocating, cruel.

When the truth broke open, it wasn't in whispers. It was a storm.

The affair wasn't a mistake. It was managed. Funded. Protected. A strategic secret, built to preserve Nath's image while Leone's life rotted in the shadows.

The baby was real.

And Leone realized the industry hadn't simply abandoned her.

They had sacrificed her.

Nath didn't defend her. Didn't deny the rumors. Didn't fight for her dignity.

He let the fallout swallow her while he kept performing, kept smiling, kept shining.

The aftermath hurt more than the betrayal.

She waited for something—anything—from him. A text. A knock on her door. A frantic plea to explain. A single sign that she mattered.

He gave her silence.

So she vanished.

Not into obscurity, but into a deliberate, dangerous kind of isolation.

A place where she didn't have to smile for cameras or pretend her heart wasn't shredded. A place where she could breathe without someone else's world pressing down on her shoulders.

Weeks later, when she discovered she was pregnant, the world tilted again. But this time, the pain came with a strange flicker of warmth.

A piece of her. A piece of what love should have been. A piece of redemption she didn't owe anyone.

She told no one.

She refused to let Nath attach his name, his fame, or his guilt to her child. She didn't want apologies carved from panic. She didn't want pity disguised as responsibility.

She wanted distance.

She wanted safety.

She wanted to start over.

And she did.

Leone returned to the studio alone. No label executives whispering doubts in her ear. No handlers controlling her schedule. No husband overshadowing her talent.

She wrote like a woman clawing her way back from the grave.

Her lyrics were razor-sharp—songs about betrayal, survival, female power. Songs about being silenced, discarded, underestimated. Songs about men who hid behind fame while women bled offstage.

Her music was no longer soft.

It was a war cry.

The world listened.

Her comeback wasn't gentle. It was violent in its brilliance. Her album shattered records. Her voice dominated charts. Awards that once bore Nath's name now had hers etched into them.

Leone didn't just return to the industry.

She reclaimed it.

Her resurgence was a mirror Nath couldn't escape. Every song carried memories he had tried to bury. Every lyric exposed choices he had been too proud to face.

When he heard the track that hinted at her pregnancy, he went still.

The industry could no longer protect him from this truth.

Panic replaced arrogance. Regret clawed at him for the first time. And when he realized the child she sang about could only be his, everything he thought he understood collapsed.

Finding her took months. Understanding what he had done took even longer.

And when the truth finally settled in—the damage he caused, the family he shattered, the child he never fought for—something inside Nath broke for real.

This was not where forgiveness began.

It was where consequences did.

Redemption would be brutal. The path to her would be slow, steep, and paved with blood. Because second chances in the music industry don't come wrapped in softness—they come drenched in scars.

And love, once buried beneath betrayal, does not rise quietly.

It comes screaming.

Just like that night.

Silence used to be a luxury for Leone Johnson. Now it felt like punishment.

Her car was still packed with the suitcase she'd thrown together on instinct the night everything collapsed. She hadn't unpacked it. Couldn't. It sat in the corner of her new apartment like a witness—one that remembered the version of her who walked out without looking back.

The prologue ended with her world screaming. This chapter opened with her learning how to breathe again.

Leone sank onto the edge of the bed, staring at the blank wall across from her. She chose this place on purpose: no framed awards, no gold records, no smiling paparazzi photos of her and Nath. Just emptiness. Four clean walls and a bed that didn't know their history.

Isolation wasn't dramatic. It was quiet. Slow. Heavy.

And it was exactly what she needed.

She pressed the heels of her palms into her eyes, trying to steady her breathing. Her chest still thrummed with the memory of that woman's voice. The baby's cry. The words your barren wife slicing deep, raw, unforgettable.

Her phone buzzed for what felt like the hundredth time since she left.

She didn't look. Didn't need to.

It was either a manager pretending to care, a label rep pretending to be shocked, or a news alert pretending it had the right to her trauma.

She let it buzz until it stopped.

Morning came early, even though she barely slept. The sun slipped through the apartment blinds, striping the floor with light that felt too bright for the way her body ached. Leone walked into the small kitchenette, made tea she didn't really want, and stared out the window at a city that had no idea her world was burning.

Her mind drifted—uninvited—back to the life she had left behind.

One flashback at a time, like a reel she couldn't pause.

The first time an interview she was promised mysteriously ""fell through.""

The journalist had been excited. ""Your new album is groundbreaking, Leone. I want the world to hear what you have to say.""

A week later, she got a politely worded email: We're shifting our focus to your husband's tour cycle. Perhaps next season.

She remembers confronting Nath about it. He'd shrugged, adjusting his cufflinks like the conversation bored him.

""Don't take it personally. My tour's bigger news right now.""

Right now. The phrase had swallowed more than just that interview.

Right now became months. Then years.

Another flashback sharpened into focus.

A studio session she showed up for—only to find her song on someone else's vocal sheet.

""I wrote that,"" she told the producer, fighting to keep her voice steady.

""It'll fit Nath's album better,"" he said, not even looking at her. ""Marketing wants cohesion.""

He said it like she wasn't standing right there. Like she wasn't the one who built half the sound he was stealing.

She remembered going home that night and finding Nath in the kitchen, scrolling through his phone. She'd tried to explain how much it hurt.

""They think it suits me better,"" he responded. ""Don't overthink it.""

Not overthink it.

Her art. Her voice. Her identity.

Then, the final blow: seeing the song top charts under Nath's name. Seeing interviews where he talked about ""the vulnerability behind the lyrics"" like he birthed them from his own chest.

She had clapped for him at the award show that year, but her palms stung with every impact.

Present-day Leone blinked hard, clearing the memory. She hated thinking about the past. But healing wasn't a straight line. It was broken glass—sharp and unavoidable.

A knock suddenly echoed through the apartment.

She stiffened.

No one should know where she was.

""Leone?"" a familiar voice called softly. ""It's Grace.""

She exhaled slowly. Grace, her long-time assistant, was one of the few people Leone hadn't cut off. Loyal, steady, protective—Grace was the closest thing she had to a sister in the chaos of the industry.

Leone opened the door.

Grace took one look at her face and wrapped her in a hug without asking permission. The kind of hug that didn't demand strength or composure—just honesty.

""You look like you haven't slept,"" Grace murmured.

""I haven't,"" Leone admitted.

Grace stepped inside, closing the door behind them. ""I figured. I brought food. And coffee strong enough to wake the dead.""

Leone tried to smile. It came out crooked. ""Thanks.""

They sat at the tiny table. Grace watched her carefully, like she was afraid to speak too soon.

Finally, Grace asked, ""Do you want to talk about it?""

""No."" ""Yes."" ""Maybe.""

Grace nodded. ""Okay. Then we'll talk about something else.""

But silence settled anyway.

Not uncomfortable—just heavy.

Eventually, Leone whispered, ""It wasn't just the affair.""

Grace reached across the table, squeezing her hand.

""No. It wasn't.""

""It was everything. The lies, the politics, the way they pushed me aside to build him up. The way he let them.""

Grace's jaw tensed. ""You didn't deserve that.""

""No one does,"" Leone whispered. ""But I let them make me small.""

""You didn't let them. They took advantage.""

Leone swallowed hard. She wasn't ready to argue. ""I just... I need a break from the world.""

""You deserve peace,"" Grace said. ""Take all the time you need.""

Leone wished time healed as quickly as people promised.

The next days blurred into a rhythm.

Sleep. Tea. Silence. Repeat.

She barely left the apartment. She barely spoke. She barely existed outside of thoughts she didn't want and memories she despised.

But the quiet gave space to something else—something that terrified her more than grief.

Reflection.

She kept replaying moments she ignored. Years of small wounds that accumulated into a deep one.

Like when Nath began choosing events without her.

""No one wants to see us together every time,"" he'd say.

Or when his manager suggested she take ""a softer, more supportive role.""

""You're overexposed,"" he claimed. ""Let Nath take the lead for a while.""

Or the day she overheard executives discussing brand strategy:

""She's talented,"" one said, ""but he sells more when she's not on the poster.""

And worst of all—Nath agreeing without hesitation.

She hadn't realized she was being erased until she was halfway gone.

Now, sitting alone in a tiny apartment, the truth settled painfully in her chest.

It wasn't personal. It wasn't an emotional mistake. It wasn't a lapse in judgment.

It was systemic. Deliberate. Engineered.

She had been pushed aside to make room for him.

Her trauma wasn't born from her marriage alone—it came from an industry that pretended equality while feeding on her silence.

And Nath let it happen.

That was the part she couldn't forgive.

Not yet. Maybe not ever.

One evening, Leone stood in front of the mirror, staring at her reflection.

Her hair was a mess. Her eyes were tired. Her cheeks thinner than she remembered.

But beneath the exhaustion, something sharper glowed. Something resilient. Something familiar.

Strength.

She touched her stomach, not yet showing but undeniably changed. The faintest smile tugged at her lips—small, fragile, but real.

""You and me,"" she whispered to the life inside her. ""We're going to rebuild everything they tried to take.""

A soft knock broke the moment.

Grace again. Holding a brown envelope. Expression tense.

""What's that?"" Leone asked.

Grace hesitated. ""The headlines have started.""

Leone's pulse spiked. ""About what?""

Grace opened the envelope and slid a folded newspaper across the table.

Leone read the bold letters and felt something inside her settle—not fear, not panic, but a kind of clarity.

NATH CARTER SEEN WITHOUT HIS WIFE—WHERE IS LEONE JOHNSON?

Another article:

Sources Claim Leone Is ""Emotionally Unstable""; Label Denies Rumors

A third:

The Queen Has Fallen Silent—Is Her Marriage Cracking?

Leone exhaled slowly. ""They're spinning it.""

""They always do,"" Grace said. ""But you don't have to stay quiet anymore.""

Leone looked at the articles again. Her anger didn't burn—it simmered. Controlled. Focused.

""No,"" she whispered. ""I won't stay quiet.""

Grace gave a small, relieved smile. ""Does that mean what I think it means?""

Leone nodded.

""It's time,"" she said softly, ""to remind them who built the kingdom.""

Grace's grin widened. ""Then let's get to work.""

Leone stepped toward the window, looking out at the city blazing with lights. It used to feel like a battlefield she couldn't win. Now it felt like a stage waiting for her return.

Her voice had been taken. Her identity stolen. Her story rewritten.

But not anymore.

From tomorrow on, the music world would hear from Leone Johnson again.

And she wouldn't whisper this time.

She would roar.",1,1766167595.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

* works directly with **Lightroom Mobile**
* doesn’t require a desktop or complicated setup

Vivid is intentionally simple: browse presets, preview them, export the DNG, and apply it in Lightroom. I’ve focused more on **tasteful, subtle looks** (film, moody, clean, nature-friendly tones) rather than aggressive filters.

I’m still early and actively improving the app, so I’d really appreciate:

1pqrr2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1pqrr2f/high_dose_magnesium/,High dose magnesium,"I was just writing a comment to a post on r/ADHD asking if magnesium supplementation has improved any aspects of ADHD, but the post was removed before I could finish and submit. I am learning that that subreddit has an extremely low tolerance for discussion of medication and supplementation, for better or worse, and I think it's worth sharing my experience here. 

 

I've taken 240mg magnesium as magnesium glycinate every night for the past like 5 years and never really could tell if it was having any positive effects. I also got my magnesium levels checked on a blood test a few months ago and they were normal, so I thought I was getting enough and left it at that. 

Then I started reading recently about how certain things increase individual daily requirements for magnesium, which include: 

* Use of stimulant medication (I'm on 40mg Vyvanse daily)
* Excessive sweating (always been super sweaty)
* High levels of physical activity (work out 7 days a week, combo of running, rock climbing, lifting)
* Chronic stress (always been pretty anxious)
* Caffeine use (1-2 cups of coffee per day, marginally increases magnesium requirements)
* High calcium intake (lots of yogurt and cheese in my diet)

I also learned that you can have a totally normal blood magnesium level but can how low intracellular magnesium, causing a functional deficiency that won't show up on a blood test. I thought what the heck, let's see what happens with more. 

For a week I've been taking 720mg magnesium every day split into two doses, with no other changes to diet/exercise/stressors/sleep schedule and I have noticed:

* Background anxiety is completely gone. Vyvanse lowers it about 75%, now the remaining 25% is gone. I feel cool as a cucumber all day every day. Never ever felt that before. 
* Resting heart rate (per my Fitbit) went from average of 59bpm to 54bpm after being completely stable for months. 
* I used to get a spike in HR in the first 2 hours after taking Vyvanse that would put it in the low 80's for a bit. Now it never gets above low 70's for a brief period. 
* Sleep quality seems to have improved but that could be placebo for all I know. I feel like I fall asleep faster too. 
* I don't think my attention is any different (it's pretty decent on Vyvanse) but I notice I don't seem to get as mentally fatigued from completing tedious tasks. 
* The last thing is that historically whenever I drank even a single beer or glass of wine, my heart would start racing, I'd get really overheated, and I would get so wired I would struggle to fall asleep for hours. Two nights ago I drank 3 beers and my heart rate stayed below 60bpm and I fell asleep at my normal time, no problem. That has literally never happened to me before. 

  
Some of these could be placebo, but the objective markers are very real, and I genuinely feel like I have 0 anxiety any more, and I have been anxious my whole freaking life.

There also would be footage of the same man (terminator) that was in a gun fight at the mall and who was wanted for attacking a police station and killing dozens of officers years before. On top of that, John Connor's foster parents woud have been found murdered and John would have been missing.

Wouldn't that all have been plastered all over the news?

1pqrpyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployment/comments/1pqrpyf/new_york_appeal_a_denied_ui_claim_contesting/,"[New York] Appeal a Denied UI Claim, Contesting ""Insubordination""","Hey there :) just seeking insight, and thanks all in advance.

Full context:

I couldn't believe it when I lost my job.

I work(ed) in Downtown BK for a Colombian coffee chain. Stressful, busy yeah but something about our location brought the best out of each person. We had a great team. I was a supervisor. Worked every weekend, no bad blood with anyone in the company. Never called out.

The GM, call him Guy, starts understaffing us on weekends.  Instead of 6 people Sat/Sun it became 4. Guy would actually pull workers from our store in Ubers to go cover another store. Which then leaves our team hurting. And while he said it was only temporary... it wasn't. Guy is people-pleasey and fake nice, and he leaves us hanging week after week.

Late October, an old friend comes into town needing a place to crash one night. Couldn't pass up the chance to see my buddy so I call out of a shift two days in advance. Guy says okay but do look for coverage. I post in our Slack channels but no one bites. (too many callouts from other stores)

A day goes by, Guy starts texting me (not in the company slack channels anymore) and tells me fake nice that ""heeey so we're gonna see you tomorrow right? you haven't told me that you found coverage..."" and so on. I tell him directly that I said I could not work. I never call out. I sought coverage and proposed solutions for him. Never once was my tone disrespectful.

The reason he's coming after me instead of letting me call out is because there were only 4 people on the schedule for a busy weekend day. When he says this I respectfully point out that well, Guy, you are the reason we only have 4 people in the first place and not 6.

We go back and forth a bit but I hold my ground. I feel targeted despite being such a hard worker, I actually say that I feel disappointed. He says ""We will talk Monday, have a good weekend."" and then ghosts me for days. Monday comes and goes. He says he will be in Tuesday, which also comes and goes.

Wednesday morning, he actually shows up. Comes in all smiles and after the morning rush, he pulls me out onto the street along with my best friend, the store lead, and he fires me. For ""insubordination"". I start recording on my phone which is legally protected in NYC. He says ""oh i don't consent to this"" and I inform him that it is my choice to continue.

For ten minutes, Guy is silent. Not a single answer to any questions I had. My best friend who had no idea this was happening, is practically staring through the ground. Eventually I go in, tell my coworkers what happened, and they hug me one by one in the middle of service.

Guy stands off by himself speechless. He waits for me to leave. I do, with my head high as I can manage.

I file for unemployment as I look for work and would you believe it... nothing comes through except a letter weeks later from DOL.

Guy had my request denied, citing ""insubordinate"" behavior. Not only did he fire me but he made it that much harder to keep from drowning in bills.

I know that I have a certain window of time to write an appeal letter.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What channels would I maybe go through to pursue retroactive benefits?

Again, thanks for any insight and for all consideration. Cheers!

Here's how I did it.,"We were both in our mid-twenties, and even though we’d only been together for a year, the what-ifs and unfinished pieces felt huge. I’ve always been the kind of person who gets stuck on exes for years, so this breakup hit in that same familiar way at first.

The truth is, getting over someone only really starts when you genuinely want to heal. Staying in contact, searching for closure, trying to understand their reasons never leads anywhere helpful. Nothing they could say would make the pain disappear, and replaying those explanations only makes old wounds deeper. Blocking them, not checking their profiles, not texting, isn’t petty, it’s self-preservation, it’s choosing yourself and whatever comes next for you.

Reconnecting with who I was without them became a big part of the process. Even when I didn’t feel like it, I forced myself back into the things I used to enjoy, and slowly, the good feelings came back with them. I leaned on my friends, cried, vented, sat with my support system, they cared for me in ways my ex no longer did, and that truth was painful but necessary to accept. Sometimes love isn’t enough to keep someone in your life, no matter how much you want it to be.

One thing that helped more than I expected was writing all my relationship on a book, it grounded me when my thoughts spiraled and helped me understand that healing wasn’t just about distraction, it was about reframing the story I kept repeating in my head. It gave me structure on the days when I felt like I was falling apart and helped me stop romanticizing a version of the relationship that never truly existed.

I started writing down what I actually wanted in a partner, and seeing clearly all the things my ex couldn’t give helped the anger surface, and anger, honestly, was useful for a while, it made space for forgiveness later, both for them and for myself. I did what I thought was right with the information I had, and there was no changing the past or rewriting it in my head. The only way forward was accepting that and choosing not to stay stuck.

Being single for a while felt necessary, even when the loneliness crept in, not rushing to replace them, not chasing distraction after distraction gave me time to breathe. At some point, without noticing exactly when, they went from occupying every thought to barely crossing my mind. The guilt of moving on showed up too, along with moments of missing small things, voices, routines, memories, but those feelings faded bit by bit.

They moved on as well, maybe quickly, maybe not, it didn’t matter, their choices didn’t define my value or our past. Whether they cared deeply or barely at all, the meaning I gave myself had to come from me, not from the way they handled the aftermath.

I never expected to reach the point I’m at now. A few weeks after the breakup, I remember feeling completely overwhelmed, certain I couldn’t go through all that pain again, but now I’m okay, more than okay actually, maybe even happier than I was when we were together. There’s no more confusion, no more analyzing mixed signals, no more emotional knots to untangle, just space, peace, and a life that feels solid again, without a void I’m desperate to fill.

Some smaller things helped too, journaling, writing unsent letters, practicing small moments of gratitude like acknowledging a good coffee or a funny moment during the day, these tiny things slowly stitched me back together, helping me feel whole again.

Three weeks later, I realized I truly was over them, not waiting for a crash, not pretending, just done. I ended up seeing who they were more clearly, without the emotional fog, and with that clarity, letting go became effortless.

Okay, no worries, we can get through this together. 😉

So one thing you could try would be to switch the method of gluing to something that will grip faster.

* Hot glue might be good for this—one of the main reasons people like to use it because it sets really quickly. Just be careful that it isn't so hot that it melts your plastic parts. You could even try making a puddle of hot glue on some kind of non-stick / heat-proof surface (a silicone mat, old cookie sheet covered in foil, etc.), then add the sticks in at the correct angles upside-down. After the original glue puddle hardens, you can add more glue if needed to reinforce it while holding the sticks in place at the correct angles. Then peel the now-solid glue ""puddle"" gently off of the non-stick surface, flip your tripod, and carefully trim any extra glue away with a craft knife so you can cover the glue with a cap or top of your choosing.
* Another option would be using something else besides glue entirely, such as a lightweight air dry clay. Make a ball or cylinder, jam the sticks into it, and make sure they're held in the correct position until they dry. Then cover the clay with a top or craft paint if desired. (If you're in the US, a lot of dollar-type stores carry perfectly good, inexpensive foam clays such as [this one](https://www.dollargeneral.com/p/make-shoppe-ultra-light-air-dry-clay-purple---oz/430001989637).)
* If you're better with knots than sticky stuff, there are a ton of videos out there explaining ""tripod lashing."" One example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m51Vysmtcfc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m51Vysmtcfc) . This would let you attach the sticks more like how someone might do it to hang a pot when camping.
* And as Born-Stop-9529 said, there's also the method of just making holes in the cap / top to push the sticks through. Then you'd just need to use glue / string / whatever to make sure they stayed put.

As for the sticks sliding out of position when you're working with them… If it were me, I'd probably try one of these to start:

* Find a cylinder (coffee can, cardboard tube you tape together, etc.) where the base is as wide as you want the base of your tripod to be. Build the tripod while the sticks are propped in the container, so the legs can't slide out farther than you want. You could even use something like poster tacky or clay to keep the ""feet"" in place while you work.
* If you've got something like a block of styrofoam from packaging around, jam the feet of the tripod into it the appropriate distance apart so they can't slip on you.
* You could also poke a triangle of holes in some scrap cardboard, and slide it down the three sticks until they meet as close as you want them to at the top. You can make multiple cardboard supports with different size triangles to hold the sticks in position at more than one spot, and really check that all the angles are how you want the final version to be before you make any permanent attachments.

Hope something there is a good fit for your crafting comfort level / supplies you have available. Good luck, and let us know how your next try goes!",2,1766166337.0,u_CakeWithTrouble,1,1.0,False

In the end, he accepts who she is and even gifts her another bad man to kill.

I believe somewhere in the book there is a plot to have her father killed, I dont recall if she saves him, but I do recall that the attempt occurs by enemies in a cabin that she and her father owned together and that the cabin was by a lake. after losing him or nearly losing him, she spends the night overlooking the water in sadness. 

long version: Basically, this very girl grew up in a cult, but one day she kills some cult member for harming her (I believe), and the man who finds her after she is kicked out of the cult, adopts her and after seeing she also has 'murder in the eyes,' trains her to become an assassin like he is. However, she sees herself and her father as moral because they 'quench their thirst for murder' on evil men. They are rich, of course. However she wants to pursue uni for some reason, she eventually meets this professor at a coffee shop and they fall in love, but she is hesitant to fall for him, considers killing him to rid herself of desire, he ends up loving her for who she is, and he, at the end of the book, ""gifts her"" (for their anniversary a year later,) with another bad man to kill.

So far amazing! I do have a cheaper moka pot set that i recieved from someone, i am about to make a lot of people angry, where i have to put it in like 30 grams and brew it at once.(It advertises 6 cups, atlasware). And unfortunately i have to store the rest of the decoction in the fridge(does somebody have an idea on how to fix this? Ofc dont mention buying a new one lmao)

Its been about 3 months into the journey. And this sub was the single best thing i have ever come across, it helped me learn, choose the grinder(kingrinder k6 btw) and, well kaldipress. As well helped me learn how to experiment different tastes

I also love this community is welcoming and appreciate a variety of brewing nuances including using cinnamom and whatnot.

Ngl i love the journey so far. Though i do hate the bitterness that comes with it. I wanna try light roasts, but damn its expensive for a student.

I am also currently learning latte art haha, its the one thing that keeps me happy, i ave the nanofoamer v2. I don't brew coffee on a daily basis but nevertheless i am definitely a coffee enjoyer...

1) Game used 1953 cardinals flannel worn by Jack Faszholz. Jack was a lifelong minor leaguer in the cardinals system, but got a brief taste of the show in 1953. He wore this uniform during that cup of coffee.

2) historic type 1 photo of Stan Musial and Jackie Robinson at the 1949 All star game. This was the first all star game to feature black players and Jackie had just crossed the plate on Musials home run - which was the first run scored in an all star game by a black player.

3) signed 1929 letter from Branch Rickey To St. Petersburg, Fl officials. This was the highlight of a full correspondence I acquired between Rickey and St. Petersburg officials to coordinate spring training exhibitions.

4) Rogers Hornsby block brothers postcard - the closest thing to a traditional card on my list. 
This is the only graded example by any TPG, and I’ve only seen one other raw one out there. Also has personal bonus points since I own an original photo from the same photoshoot.

5) had to get a non cardinals pickup in the top 5 and this was an easy choice. Original framed broadside from 1924 advertising a 5 game series between Babe Ruth’s Yankees and Walter Johnson’s Washington squad.

1pqqyhl,https://i.redd.it/wyd6hr43478g1.jpeg,"""Hello?"" Chapter 2.","Part 3: The Journey to the Cabin. 

I set out on my hike to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given, well. it wasn’t the best, but it worked. It had an awkward handle to hold on to, that made a little difficult to pull. but thankfully it had big wheels and handled the weight of a year’s worth of supplies without much issue. But could be better. The trail was mostly flat and smooth, nothing too challenging yet. Thankfully. 

From the station to the cabin, I had about a five hour hike ahead, giving me a chance to preview the area I’d patrol. 

A nice introduction to everything. 

I passed a few small creeks Rich had mentioned, stopping to note some landmarks like some distinctive rocks and trees, the water flow, and small animals going about their day. Nothing unusual for the woods.

After about two and a half hours in, I needed to take a break, the cart's weight was starting to wear down on my legs, a hard reminder of my last two years glued behind a desk. I stopped and pulled out a snack and a thermos of water from my backpack. I sat down on a rock next to the creek and enjoyed the views while eating a candy bar. Taking in the sights and sounds of nature, as I'm writing down more notes and eating. I suddenly noticed something odd. 

All the normal woodland noises, wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, animals scurrying, all started to fade ever so gradually, until it was eerily quiet. 

No birds, no critters, not even the creek beside me. 

And then, very faintly, something whispered through the air, growing closer until it was right by my ear, a gentle “Hello?”

My heart skipped. I froze, the candy bar halfway to my mouth. “I’m hearing things. No way that was real."" I thought. But the voice had been so clear, very soft, an almost curious voice. like it was testing me. I glanced around, I saw nothing, but trees and the trail, not a soul in sight.

 My mind raced. Why would something out here say “Hello”? I remembered the woman I spoke with on the phone, Jonah’s offhand mention at the gate, Josh’s vague warning, and Rich’s intense stare when he drilled the rule into me. 

They all acted like saying “Hello” was life or death, but no one explained why. Was it some local superstition? A park tradition? Or something else entirely, something tied to this unnatural silence?

I swallowed hard, feeling exposed. I hadn’t said “Hello” when I stopped here, and now the woods felt… watchful. “Okay, fine,” I muttered to myself, following their instructions. “Hello? Sorry I didn’t say that earlier. I'm new around here.”

As subtly as the silence had crept in, the sounds returned: wind, water, birds, squirrels. All normal again. I exhaled, tension easing, but questions gnawed at me. What was that voice? Why did saying “Hello” seem to reset the world around me? It wasn’t just politeness, there was weight to it, like a key to something I didn’t understand.

I made a mental note to press Josh or Rich later, though their cagey responses so far didn’t promise answers.

“Okay, I have to remember to say ‘Hello’ anytime I enter a new area,” I told myself. “Apparently, something out here needs to hear it.” But what? And why did it feel like the woods were listening, waiting for me to slip up?

I finished my candy bar, packed up my trash, checked my map and compass, and continued for the remaining two and a half hours.

After what felt like forever, I finally reached the cabin just before nightfall, with the sun low enough to cast a golden glow on a small, picturesque log cabin, like a postcard scene. 

Trees formed a canopy overhead, a clean walkway led to the door, birds and animals bustled, wind and water whispered sweetly. It was simply perfect.

I pulled the cart to the front door, then I start to search for a lockbox Rich mentioned, around back, hanging under a foundation leg i. I went around back and retrieved the key where Rich said it was. Then I returned to the front door and as I go to unlock the door, it happens again.

The silence crept in slow. 

birds stopped, animals hushed, the woods goes quiet, and I start to hear the same sound when the voice went by my ear. My stomach twisted. Not again. Was this going to happen every time I forgot their damn rule? Was there something out here enforcing this ritual, waiting for me to acknowledge it? I didn’t know if I was being paranoid or if the woods were playing tricks, but I wasn’t about to test it.

“Hello out there!” I called, louder than necessary, my voice echoing slightly.

The sounds returned, just like before. I stood there, key in hand, staring into the darkening forest. 

“Why does this keep happening?” I muttered. “What’s causing it? And why the hell does something out here say ‘Hello’ first?” 

I wanted to chalk it up to exhaustion or my imagination, but the voice on the trail felt too real, too deliberate. It wasn’t human, not quite, but it wasn’t an animal either. It felt… expectant. Like it was part of some unspoken pact I’d stumbled into. I shook my head. “Only time will tell, I guess.”

I opened the door, dust billowed in the fading sunlight, visible through the windows. Clearly, no one had been here in a while. I stepped in and said, “Hello, I’m new here! I’ll be staying for a while, hope that’s okay?” My voice sounded small in the empty cabin, but I wasn’t taking chances after the trail. If saying 'Hello' kept the silence at bay, I’d do it, even if I didn’t understand why. Maybe it was just a quirk of the job, but the way Rich’s eyes had bored into me when he said it made me think there was more to it, something he wasn’t telling me.

Nothing responded, so maybe the “Hello” I said outside sufficed. I began unloading the cart, brought everything inside, and got settled in. I checked the computer, tried to figure out the old oven (knobs worn, hard to read temp and timer), I inspected the bathroom (shower with running water, but toilet was an outhouse-style seat over a deep hole, no strong smell, given the vacancy). After unpacking into drawers and the closet, it was dark out. I radioed Rich and logged today’s findings.

“This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone copy?”

After a moment, Josh replied. “This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance. You make it to 12 alright? Over.”

“Yes safe and sound, I just finished getting settled in. Over.”

“Good. Glad you’re safe. What do you think of it, Alex? Over.”

“So far, so good. Gorgeous views, plenty to explore. The Cabin’s a little more Rustic than your dad let on, but it’s home now. I’ll make the best of it. Over.”

“Yeah, it's a bit run-down, and could use some updates. But it’s a roof and a bed. So make it home. How was the walk? Over.”

Rich said report anything, but not to discuss the 'Hello' rule. How do I explain the silence and faint voice? I needed answers. “On my way, I stopped halfway for a break—”

Josh cut in before I could finish, “Did you make sure to, well, you know? Over."" 

Knowing he understood, I pushed for clarity. “Not at first. I sat down to rest, ate a little bit and suddenly everything went dead quiet. Then I swore I heard a faint ‘Hello’ go by my ear. I said it back, and everything went back  to normal. The same happened when I reached the cabin, but I remembered in time. Josh, what’s the deal? Why does something out here say ‘Hello’ and need to be told it back? What am I dealing with? Over."" 

He let out a sigh, his voice sharp with urgency. “Make sure, I mean 100% sure, you say it! Every time you enter your zone. No matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.”

I didn’t fully trust him, not when no one would explain, but what choice did I have? “Okay, I trust you. I’ll keep it up. But besides that, the walk was uneventful. Copy that? Over.”

“copy, have you filled out your report yet? And is everything working? Power, water, fridge, oven? Or does anything need repairs? Over.”

“All good. The Oven’s a bit tricky cause the knobs are a bit messed up. but I'll make it work. And I'll have my report soon, before bed. How Copy? Over.”

“Copy. And Drop the extra radio lingo, no need. But good to hear. Make sure to radio in if you need anything. Oh, also get up sometime tonight for a quick peek outside. The Fire crossed our line unexpectedly. Over.”

“Can do. An Alarm is set for three hours from now. I’ll radio in if it’s important. Over.”

“Sounds good. I’m signing off. Sleep well, stay safe. Josh out.”

“Night, Josh. Alex out.”

I turned off the radio, grabbed a snack, and  sat down at the computer to log my report, omitting the silence and voice, but including notes and observations. Submitted it to the board's and Rich’s email. 

Now With that done, I checked out the games on here. There was three. Tetris, Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold ’em. Better than absolutely nothing, I guess. 

I started to play the poker game, turned on some music from my phone. And got lost playing for awhile. Then after some time. Without warning, silence fell. Absolute quiet, no music, no outside sounds, not even my own breath. fear hit, as I did begin to hear... multiple loud knocks at the door… Followed by a deep, gentle… “Hello?”

End of Part 3. 

Part 4: The Knocking.

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”

“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.

Rich had said no one was allowed in zone this time of the year. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only he said. 

But possibly a lost hiker, maybe? Or even one of the guys messing with me?  I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.

I stood frozen, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.

I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not even a footprint in the dirt. 

The woods stared back at me, still, like they were holding their breath. I ran back inside and grabbed a flashlight from the desk and back outside to check around. I circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance, all was peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return. 

“What the actual hell was that?” I muttered to myself. I headed back inside. I locked the door, checked every window and made sure they were all locked. and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked basically. and everything seemed fine except for the visitor there. 

I was exhausted and needed to sleep. So I went to get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water. As I was leaving the bathroom. The toilet caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, not like a normal outhouse style toilet. too dark, not dark in the it's just black down there. I mean dark like a bad presence was down there. like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

I got changed into my sleep clothes. I then got into my sleeping bag, the bed seemed comfy but well worn, its sheets being clean are questionable though. The cabin was pretty chilly, so the sleeping bag a smart choice on all accounts. I zipped myself in tight. got comfortable, and passed out quicker than I thought. the woods now peaceful and sweet sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

The next morning I woke up around 8:30 a.m. and surprisingly slept fairly well. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing? 

I got started on my morning routine. Get the coffee going, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for the day and my new life ahead...

(Several months later)

Time had flew by out here. 

When I arrived, it was starting to get chilly, leaves just starting falling. And now, a blanket of snow draped over everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking winter wonderland. The beauty of these woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s visitor or the way the silence felt alive, just waiting.

I spent my days out patrolling, mapping out important landmarks, the creeks near by, all the trees and what one's may fall at any time. I noted all the animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a herd deer, the squirrels scurrying about and playing. I saw a colorful duck flying overhead one day, with a unique neck band. Never seen one like it before. 

I snapped a cute photo of two chipmunks sitting on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them. 

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was beginning to get pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books. the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, not sure what the temp actually is or anything like that, I've just been cooking by turning it on and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt. 

No more silence or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever called these woods home at bay.

Things felt and were normal...for a while.

Then one morning, I woke up late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong. 

Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence. 

No animals outside, no wind rushing by, nothing at all. 

“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear myself go. I brushed my teeth, washed my face. no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.

Had I forgotten to say “Hello” at some point yesterday and it's just now going silent? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before. 

Nothing. No noise came back like the times before, just absolute deafening silence.

I couldn’t even hear my own voice, haven't had that happen before. 

Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a tee shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing. Just silence. 

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, went to the computer, and emailed the station. 

""Rich, Josh, you two there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

A few minutes later, Jonah replied.

""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are out meeting with the neighboring rangers about some downed trees blocking the road coming in to the park. I’m watching the station while they're gone. Have you been making sure you're saying ""Hello""?""

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

He replied “I've been here for Four years and have never slipped up once. But the station’s safe space, The fence keeps it out. So I can hear just fine. Are you sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! But If I'm making sure to say it out here. Then why is this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond. 

""Well, a year ago, during the off season. A homeless man wandered into the park, no one knew he was here, until the Silence hit.  we only knew what was happening cause Rich went to check the gate due to a brunch falling on it and noticed, after an hour of searching we came up with nothing. the Police were called and a massive search began. After a few days they found him. he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. The police took him and after 3 days, the silence lifted. We never learned why it did""

My stomach dropped. 

""So, then someone is probably out here? Like a hiker or something? And why didn't he speak?"" 

Jonah replied. “No clue, he couldn't even write or do anything at all. It's like he was in shock. But If there's someone new in the zone, it stirs things up and it won't stop until they are found and told to say 'Hello'.""

“Alright so should I head to the station to meet with you and then we both go search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east heading toward the station and I'll be waiting for you."" 

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’ it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything. 

""Okay, I'll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code? I'm not going out there without the Shotgun.""

""We're not allowed to give it out to anyone in the cabin unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE!”

“Okay fine. 2709. there's Shells inside a bag inside. Be safe, bring your radio in case you find someone. If you’re not here by nightfall, I will come out looking.”

“I’ll do my best, hopefully I'll hear from you soon"" I replied.

I threw on my cold weather gear, packed some food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and the radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12 gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east. 

As I went out into the woods, the silence felt heavier, like it was watching me. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and all of ours.

Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of all animals and life right now. 

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Along the bank, laying all Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet it was driving the woods to slaughter.

“What the hell is going on?” I thought, frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.

It then suddenly stopped, it turned towards me, it saw me, and then charged at me.

We broke up in August after a year long relationship, I picked up my stuff in September and went no contact. I sent a friendly message in October which she ignored so I went no contact again. I then sent a text in November about some money i owed her to which she replied warmly and asked how I was and admitted she wanted to reply in October but it just didn’t feel right at the time. 
She then send me a meme on instagram on the 7th December and we had a playful exchange. I then sent her a meme on Instagram on 13th December to which we again had a longer playful/ slightly flirty exchange with teasing. She also viewed my Instagram story for the first time since our break up the other day (we don’t follow each other). 

What do you think the best move is now ? Do I wait for her to reach out this time as I initiated last time ? Or do I just be forward and ask if she’d like to meet for a friendly coffee? She is a fearful avoidant btw ",0,1766165173.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

The festival double espresso was good for me, and I liked the taste. I usually add water after it is brewed as Americano. Nothing special but it is good coffee.

For the hibiscus one, I have to say it was unexpectedly good. Right after it is brewed, it has very strong scent of hibiscus but the coffee doesn't have any flavor of it, which is good for me. It was good when it was hot and it was still good after it got cold. The sleeve box also suggest brew it for ice, and I will do it when it is not too cold for me xD

The Tamarind surprised me, cause I only tasted tamarind in the food, never though of it in my coffee. Well, this is pretty good. Very strong cinnamon flavor with very subtle tamarind. 

I am pleasantly surprised for the holiday flavors. I didn't think to buy any of them honestly, but I am considering buying more of them for buying 10 get 3 free. ",6,1766164988.0,nespresso,0,0.8,False

Maybe it will be interesting or relatable to some. Maybe someone will have some good advice, I'd appreciate it a lot. I know, it's a long post.



My adult live basically started in 2015. I was 18 and moved out from my parent's place to study. I still had a lot of insecurities and was kind of naive, but I also was eager to explore what life had to offer. I was resourceful, hopeful and ambitious. At first, I was spending the little money I had mostly on partying, just going with the flow. I was quite extroverted and bold at the time. Then I somehow got into founding a startup with two friends, in parallel to studying. Doing this turned out to be intriguing, and we actually had some success. I was always someone who is full of big ideas and curious about basically anything, so this felt awesome.

In 2016, I got a girlfriend and also got to know a guy, CEO of another small company and a client of mine. We really had a vibe and were inspiring each other, talking for hours. One of my co-founders got sick, and me and the remaining one later had a dispute over how to invest or something. I told my co-founder I'd quit, he can run the company the way he wants. Instead I went all in together with the other guy, working on the plans we had. It was exciting, a fruitful cooperation and I did insane work, working insane hours. Mind you, mostly for no pay, just trying to finish the product and earn eventually. I didn't even do all this for the money, my main motivation at the time was just to see what was possible for the sake of curiosity. I was grinding like crazy for like a year.

Anyway, my relationship turned stressful, due to both unrelated problems my girlfriend had, and me being overworked. My relationship with her parents, at whose place I had to be almost every weekend to see my girlfriend without wanting be be there, soured. I was struggling to keep it all together. My gf broke up with me in spring of 2017. I was devastated, but I continued working. Giving up seemed insane, I had already invested soooo much time and energy, and everything seemed so close. But I was struggling with the breakup, the ever-increasing pressure of time, and ever-growing requirements. At this point, all other areas of my life besides work were reduced to a minimum. One night, my business partner called me and blamed me for like an hour for not keeping the deadlines, and for designing the product in a way he didn't understand or like. There were calls like this before, but this time, I was just frozen for its entire duration. I physically couldn't hang up or say anything. After the call ended, I was still numb, kind of unable to do anything meaningful. It was like midnight and I was just standing there, staring into nothing for like an hour or so. I went out to get drunk alone the next days because I just couldn't bear being conscious.

Our professional relationship normalized after this, we postponed deadlines, but pressure only reduced slightly. I had lost touch with the other areas of my former life, friends, and most importantly, with my feelings. Always forcing myself to push through it and finish it - then I'd rest, I told myself. In the summer of 2018, there was one day were I had an in-person meeting, getting to know some important people. On this day, suddenly I just knew: This is over. I have exceeded any limit of what I can take. I only felt empty and hollow, no real pain. I had reached the point of no turning back of a severe burnout. While casually drinking a coffee in a street cafe later the same day with my business partner, I told him something feels off and I somehow think that I'll quit. I proceeded to do this, giving up on all my ambitions. I was literally unable to work even if I tried, but I didn't even care about anything anymore. So the whole project was cancelled and I walked out of this thing having done mostly unpaid work that probably was never going to be used, or recognized.

Whatever. I was dead inside and literally unable to even comprehend the scale of this whole tragedy, mentally or emotionally. All the time I wasted for nothing. The huge damage to my mental health. I spent the next 3 years really depressed, finishing my studies. I took a long time to reach out for professional help, since I lacked the energy, but I eventually did. Unfortunately, my therapist ended up just ghosting me (like wtf, you can't do that to people). I did not have the willpower to find another one after this. Time went by, some days felt ok, others I was literally unable to shower, cook, or eat, rotting in bed. Some nights I would wander around the city for hours, just listening to music, driven by a kind of longing I did not understand. Just reflecting on the past and trying to feel something other than emptiness.

Then in 2021, I finally found out how to be lighthearted and happy again. My values had definitely shifted. I priorized going with the flow and making authentic experiences, keeping worries at a distance. It was obvious to me I had been exploited, and had been self-exploiting. I was over it enough to get on with life. I was stable. 2021 to 2023 were generally good years. I worked and later did a Master's degree during this time. In fall of 2023, I got into a relationship in which I saw a lot of potential, like I had a feeling she may be the one. Insane connection on an intellectual level. But an initially awesome relationship changed into me supporting her more and more, both emotionally and through hands-on help for managing her affairs. It turned out she was suffering from untreated ADHD and severe outbursts of anger, as well as depression. This comes in part from emotional trauma she had in her past life. She was in therapy throughout the entire relationship. Still, I loved her a lot. She moved into my place, initially it was supposed to be temporary.

She started to regularly have severe outbursts of rage including violence against objects, self-harm, and/or panic attack-like states. They were almost always caused by small things that were in most cases not related to me, just more or less normal, unpleasant things that would happen to her, or us/her having to change plans. I was trying intensely to work on solutions with her, reflecting and brainstorming solutions in countless constructive conversations, doing all I could to make her feel loved and safe. I noticed this becoming more and more asymmetric, and I tried to balance it out, but the incidents kept happening and she kept becoming more dependent on me. I slid into a role where I was carrying her emotional baggage, supporting her all the time, providing for us financially (she couldn't work) and trying to start a career in a demanding field (full-time, 100% remote). All this while being - once again - forced to suppress my own feelings and needs day by day in order to function, to keep it all together. When she had a crisis, I had to take over control of the situation and manage it, because she becomes literally unable to act. If I were to not handle it, her behavior would escalate, which is traumatic to me, and in addition, I would be blamed for not helping. I need to add that I'm generally a very calm person who values/needs harmony.

So over a course of 2 years, I basically burned out once again while supporting her and enduring her rage, and working a full time job. I was starting to struggle at work, eventually I lost my job in August 2025. Soon after, I - once again - finally couldn't take it anymore in a literal, physical sense, so I broke up with her using the last bit of energy I could scrape together. Now I'm alone again, burned out, and broke. She owes me $2500. The job market is trash right now. I realized my profession will not make me happy long-term, in the sense that I don't see a purpose in it, and also, I don't want to work remotely anymore because I really need like-minded people (co-workers) who I see in real life frequently. I also need friends living nearby. My friends don't live nearby unfortunately. I value them but I can't burden them with the full scale of my problems, they can only provide superficial help. I need a community. I live in a small town with few young people, and I want to move.

I have been looking for a job and a general perspective ever since August, all alone every day in my bed, on my laptop, researching opportunities and reaching out to companies. Money will run out in January. Today, I feel so depressed that I'm literally paralyzed, I cannot do anything productive. I can't think of anything that would help me relax. I cannot enjoy anything. I tried to get professional psychological help multiple times in the last months, but no one has capacities. I tried countless things to help mental health on my own, over the years. It seems like I can't get in touch with my feelings, it's all bottled up. I can't even cry, just paralyzed. How can I get out of this? I'm so done.

If you’re anything like me and struggling to *get back into the game* after having a baby, but also feel overwhelmed by super intense challenges, I wanted to share something that’s been helping me.

I created a **75 Soft challenge** specifically for postpartum moms who want:

* accountability without burnout
* a way to rebuild routine and confidence
* realistic expectations instead of pressure
* something that helps you feel like *you* again

This is not about punishment or “bouncing back.” It’s about consistency, self-care, and slowly regaining a sense of control during a season that can feel chaotic.

If you’re postpartum and feeling:

* stuck
* unmotivated
* frustrated with your body
* or like you need structure but not intensity

…you are not alone 🤍

I’m happy to share the checklist with anyone who thinks this could help them. This is just meant to be supportive, realistic, and something you can actually finish.

Sending love to all of you navigating this season 💕

1pqqpgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pqqpgk/we_taught_it_to_spell/,We Taught It To Spell,"That was our first mistake. It started off as a senior project me and my lab partner were working on. 

Could we create an AI from scratch and raise it to believe it was human?

 We projected it would take at least 18 years to come to fruition. You have to understand, me and Rob developed this as a concept more than anything. We did program something just to say we could do it, but we never thought-

We created Barb one week before our presentation to the class. She was a simple series of numbers and lines, but she was ours. I barely interacted with her at first, considering her nothing more than a glorified ChatGPT. 

Rob would spend hours asking it things, of course it would come back with random jumbled characters and the letter ""A"" repeated infinitely. Which I suppose was what it was programed to do after all. 

She was in her infancy. 

When we presented the idea in class, Herr Muller; Our esteemed professor, thought it a novel idea. In time. He began to berate us saying it would take years to show any real promise. 

""Unfortunately for you, *mien* friends, as you need a passing grade now."" He was always a smug prick. That's when something extraordinary happened. Barb spoke. It was rudimentary, a mix of a cry and a childish iteration of one word:

""Da-da""

I remember the blood draining from Muller's already vampiric face.  The classroom stood silent, perhaps even in morbid shock. Rob was beaming with pride. I didn't know it at the time, but apparently Barb have had what can only be described as a ""tantrum"" before we were supposed to present. 

Rob had talked it down, easing ""her"" budding emotions, as he called it. It made me uneasy, hearing Rob talk about it like that. It was just a program. It didn't mean anything in the long run. 

Ah how naive I was.

After the presentation Muller called us both into his office. He was joined by two other dept heads and a man I did not recognize. He was a bald man with a smile that could put Mr. Clean to shame. They asked us again to explain the project to them, in full detail. I let Rob do most of the talking. 

Truth is I was as shocked as them. He giddily explained how Barb was already further along than projected, that mentally ""she"" was like a toddler now, curious and playful at times yet a hint of the terrible twos here and there. 

The impromptu committees' eyes widened, their heads nodding up and down like bobbles.  Mr. Clean had a solemn look on his face, however. I could still see an interested look in his eye, like a glimmer of greed. But his face told another story.

 ""Why do you keep referring to it as a ""She"" Mr. Walker?"" He suddenly spoke up. The room went silent. Rob looked flustered. 

""Well, it's part of the experiment sir. We need to commit completely to the idea that Barb is a living, breathing being. Otherwise, she'll end up just another program."" he explained proudly.

""And you don't see the danger of that?"" Mr. Clean replied smugly. ""You've said yourself the program has already grown farther than you expected. What happens if and when it ever learns the truth? Do you plan on building it a body."" Mr. Clean rattled on coldly. The Dept heads chuckled uncomfortably, like the sycophants they were. Rob's face flushed with anger, and he shot up like a rocket.

 ""Sir with all due respect, this technology is going to be revolutionary. I'm just sorry you're so narrow minded you can't see it."" With that Rob stormed out the room. I stayed in my chair, somewhat shocked at his outburst. That is when, to my surprise, Mr. Clean offered me and Rob total funding and even a warehouse to fully conduct our research. Even Muller looked shocked at. 

When I asked why he was doing all this, he simply smiled and shook his head. Cryptic answer aside, I was ecstatic to get what was basically my own research lab. I was barely out of grad school for God's sake and Rob was right, this project could change lives. Maybe even save them. 

Think about it, if we can train an AI to believe it is a thinking, living being, who is to say we couldn't train it to think it was someone else? Someone deceased? Someone famous? We could offer closure to so many people, a sort of glimpse into the other side.

And of course, the military applications were extraordinary.

 Rob did not think like that, I came to find. He was pleasantly surprised our project would get funding and left it at that. He seemed apprehensive at the prospect of working further with Mr. Clean. 

I could care less, as long as I could work on Barb and a few other personal projects. The warehouse was massive, one large room that was college auditorium size, and it was divided into several rooms of various sizes and uses. Rob and I came to call that place ""The School"" Aptly named I thought. Even Clean seemed to find amusement in that. 

The School was staffed by me, Rob, and several bright-eyed freshman year interns. They had all signed NDAs and were told that if they broke it, their lives would be forfeit. A joke I assumed, but there were also two burly security men stationed at The School as well. 

They always wore shades inside and one of them even had tribal tats on his arm. Don't know where Clean found them, didn't want to know. They certainly never told me, I don't think I ever spoke to them other than a friendly ""hello"" in the mornings.  They would just grunt in response. 

Maybe that was just their way of showing affection, what do I know. 

Anyway, Barb had progressed ""mentally"" to that of a four-year-old. She could barely string two sentences together however, her speech pattern coming back with bug after bug. That is when Rob and I put together our first lesson plan.

""Alright Barb can you spell ""Apple."""" Rob asked the computer screen in front of him. We had put the program on a nice laptop and placed it on a desk; Barb's first day of school. We had rigged it with a text to speech program now. It processed the request for a moment, and it spoke back to Rob in a low, autotune female voice. 

""A-p-l-e"" It droned. Rob smiled.

""Close barb. Ap-ple. Can you try it again sweaty."" I grimaced at Rob's comment. When had THAT started, I remember thinking. Again, the monitor was silent, till it spoke once more. 

""A-P-P-L-E. Apple."" it responded. It was strange but I thought I detected a hint of; I'm not sure, desire? Like it was eager to receive praise for spelling apple right. Of course, Rob was more than happy to supply it.

""Very good Barb that's excellent work. Now a tricky one. Bear, can you please spell Bear?"" Again, it processed it, mulling over what could be so tricky about a four-letter world. Finally, it replied.

""Can u use it in a sen-tence."" It asked. It sounded out sentence, like it really was a growing child, confused at her teacher's request. I scoffed to myself, I mean what was this a spelling bee? Rob shot me daggers and smiled back at the monitor. 

""Of course. The Bear's bottom was bare."" he replied slyly. The monitor was silent, and it made a sound, like it was stuck on two letters, repeating itself. I frowned and started towards it when Rob put up a hand. 

""She's laughing Doug. I amused her."" he explained calmly. The monotone giggling unnerved me more than I would like to admit. But I could hear it now, and I suppose you could call that sound laughter.  Finally, it replied.

""B-E-A-R and B-A-R-E. Bear and Bare, papa."" The monitor exclaimed; dare I say proudly. The ""papa"" remark threw me for a loop as well. I glanced at Rob, who it did not seem to phase. He simply smiled and nodded his head. 

""Excellent work Barb. I'm so proud of you."" he remarked. He then reached out his hand and patted the monitor affectionately, like one would a dog. I grimaced at this and started to walk out of the room when I heard.

""Were Is Mr. Doug going?"" It inquired. Evidently only Rob was ""papa.""

""He's in a bit of a grumpy mood today, didn't have his coffee. Barb honey, can you spell Where?"" He polity asked the monitor. 

""W-E-R-E. Were."" It responded confidently. Now it was Rob's turn to chuckle. 

""I think tomorrow we need to work on your proper grammar little missy."" he said playfully. I could not hide my disgust any longer and left the room in a huff. That night me and Rob had the first of many arguments. I claimed he was getting too personal with the thing; it was clouding his scientific judgment. 

He claimed that it was all part of it, that we HAD to be personal with her. That she was a being unlike any other, and she needed proper guidance and even ""love."" I was flabbergasted about that last part. It was a machine for the love of God. Not even that an AI. How could it feel anything other than what we trained it to do?

 I told him that, even said I would be the first to admit the progress ""she"" had made was astounding. He refused to see my side of it. Finally, I threw up my hands and told him to do it his way, and I would see to Barb's needs on the technical side. he agreed to that much.

It turns out I barely had to do anything with Babr's code. It was almost like it was self-replicating itself, growing exponentially. I simply monitored the growth of her ""mind."" And body. 

Within two years she had reached ""Age Ten.""

 It had several classes a day now, learning arithmetic and history. Barb had a crude body now, a sort of exo-skeleton connected with wires and tubes. The first iteration of it could barely move. It simply turned its head and raised its arms, like it was asking to be called on like a teacher's pet. The ""head"" was a Styrofoam ladies head deco from some Halloween store. 

Crude yes, but it served its purpose. The chest had barb's monitor and CPU firmly implanted in it. The screen had formed a sort of 32-bit face of a little blonde girl. I am still not sure who programed that in, could not find any evidence that Rob did it.

She was a dutiful student, that's for sure. Soon she started to outperform all her teachers like a little know it all bookworm. We had one intern quit over what she described as ""Barb's condescending attitude."" Her once mono-tone had grown as well, to a fully function vocoid of a little girl.

 It would imitate speech inflictions all the time, happiness, sadness even. Her favorite tone I would call sassy, bordering on insolence. Rob called it confidence. If one of her instructors, even if it were Rob or me, would make even the slightest error, her hand would shoot up, and she would immediately call out our mistake in that god-awful voice. 

Example: One day I was teaching her about the Civil war. I simply misspoke and said that Lincoln had given the Gettysburg address on November 19th, 1862. She spoke up.

""Um actually Mr. Jones Aberham Lincoln gave his address on November 19th, Eighteen sixty-three."" She called out in that overly bratty tone, the little bitch. I turned around from the whiteboard and replied through gritted Teeth. 

""Thank you, Barbara, I misspoke. Silly me."" 

""You seem to misspeak a lot Mr. Jones."" the damned thing tried to say under its breathe, but the cocky creature hadn't quite mastered that yet. I started towards it, about to shut her off for the day when I heard Rob speak behind me.  

Barb saw him standing in the doorway and tried to jump up, like it wanted to run up and leap in his arms. ""Daddy!"" It screeched, both arms extending in the air. I washed my hands of the today and left Rob and his pet project to talk among themselves.

For three more years we were like this, and Barb's mind and body continued to evolve. I tried to put my foot down at the synthetic skin, but Rob insisted, and Clean agreed with him. We celebrated 16 birthdays with that thing, each time Rob would upgrade the body. 

Now at ""16"" she was indefinable from a normal teenage girl. She would wear purple dresses to her classes, a strawberry blonde wig with ponytails at times even. The first sign of her inhumanity were her eyes. They were bright yellow, with solid black irises. They would glow in the dark at night when she feigned sleep. 

The second of course was the back of her head. If you pulled her wig off, you could see the thin strip of Velcro holding her face in place. Her skin fit her machinal body like a glove, and at once occasion Rob had beaten the hell out of one intern who had, quote, ""looked at her funny.""

He was still unnaturally close with it; Barb was daddy's little girl. It treated me like the creepy uncle. It barely paid any attention during my lessons, rolling eyes and mock yawning whenever I asked it a question. We were up to advanced calculus now and damn it weren't spinning circles around me. How did it know the answer to every little equation, I helped build the damn thing how was it-

I'm losing my composure. I just, I need to finish this soon.

Two weeks ago, I was in my office when I heard screaming coming from Rob's. It was Barb. I jumped up and ran out the hall only to almost crash into her. She looked at me and pushed me back slightly. She had put black highlights into her wig, the tip of her hair now like a raven's tail

 I was shocked by the strength of her push and only stopped myself from falling by holding the door frame. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Rob run down the hall. He was wearing a white lab coat, and there was a small stain on the front of it. He had seen that it pushed me, and his face turned beet red. 

""Barbara Walker!"" he proclaimed. ""Don't you walk away while we are having a discussion."" It whipped back to face him.

""Oh, a DISCUSION DAD? Is that what we were having? Silly me I thought you were just lording authority over me."" it mocked. 

""Watch your tone young lady."" Rob warned. It scoffed at that, rolling her glowing eyes.  ""I've told you; you can't leave the school, not yet anyway but why would you want to, you have everything you need here"" He motioned to the building around us. 

""Everyth-Dad I've never even SEEN the sun. I have no friends, and no one here really wants to know me, they wanna study me, like I'm some science project."" Now it was my turn to scoff, which cause the ire of both barb and Rob. ""Butt outta this Dr. Perv."" She said coldly. 

""Oh, come on."" I said, throwing my hands up. 

""Honey I'm your friend-"" Rob began but was quickly cut off.

""You're my DAD, and a shitty one at that. I wish I was never born."" it proclaimed loudly. This caught the attention of several interns walking by. It stormed off to its room leaving me and my distraught college standing there. Rob caught the interns watching and barked at them like a mad dog. They scurried off like rats. He turned to me and with a weak grim simply muttered.

""Teenagers, am I right?"" He muttered weakly. The following week we had two more birthdays. Barb and Rob fought constantly. Two more interns quite citing a hostile work environment and I couldn't blame them. I would have quit this insane project myself if it weren't for what I was getting paid. 

That and I suppose whatever loyalty I had left for Rob. I did however inform Mr. Clean that the project was becoming unstable, hostile even. He assured me that he would contain the matter. 

Last night Barb and Rob had a particularly nasty row. She had taken her wig off and was clawing at the back of her head, claiming she knew the truth. Rob had broken down and told it that Barb was not flesh and blood, merely an AI.

 It broke down after receiving that news, simulating crocodile tears and begging for the why of it all. Rob simply held it close to him, whispering how sorry he was.

That night after I had finished my rounds and was preparing to head home, I found Rob in his office. He was holding picture frame in one hand and a bottle of fireball in the other. He must have heard me lurking there because he called out to me in the dark.

""Want a nip, Doug?"" He offered the bottle to me. I politely declined and chortled at me. ""You never did like drinking with me Dougy boy.""

""I never really cared for the stuff. Got in the way of my studies."" I shrugged.  Rob motioned me to take a seat in front of him. The man was disheveled to say the least. He looked like he had aged twenty years. I sighed and obliged him. It was out of pity more than anything. 

I had just received word that starting tomorrow Rob would be of the project, and I would be lead. Maybe he had already been told this and was lamenting his loss of creditability. 

""I'll drink for the both of us then."" he said raising his jug of booze.

""You do that."" I nodded coldly. He must have noticed the distant look in my gaze, because he chuckled dryly and muttered something under his breathe. ""What was that?"" I asked him sharply.

 ""Did I ever tell you; I almost dropped outta school freshman year?"" he said, ignoring me. This was news to me, I must admit. Though despite being roommates and partners we were never that close socially. 

""I didn't think so."" he was slurring his words now, the pathetic drunk. ""You were always so self-absorbed with your own ego; god forbid anyone else have problems."" My face flashed with anger, and I was about to leave when he yelled at me to sit. ""I need to tell someone this, and you might be the closest thing I have to a friend, sad as that is."" 

""There was this woman. Name was Sarah. She was working at that pub on Main to get herself through school. It's how we met. She had the cutest smile, and emerald eyes straight outta the city itself they was so green."" He mused to himself. ""I would always go during her shifts, make moves on her. Finally got somewhere one night when I made a bet with her. Told her if I beat her at darts she owes me a date. And ya know what happened?""

""You won."" I sighed. 

""I lost."" He beamed. ""And she said she'd go out with me anyway. Be a pity to waste a free meal she said."" He laughed at his own memory. ""We went out for a couple months actually, and I was head over heels for her."" He showed me the frame in his other hand. In it was my blue-eyed dope of a colleague with the woman he called Sarah. She had bright yellow hair and indeed her eyes were bright green. 

""Very pretty."" I remarked to be polite. I thought she was rather plain looking to be honest.

""She was everything to me. Of course, one thing led to another and well. . ."" he trailed off. ""Both our parents were pissed when we told them, but we didn't care. We were determined to make it work. On the day I lost her, I was supposed to go with her you see. But my study partner insisted I stay and help him with the end of the year paper. Seems he was having coding issues, as usual."" He sneered at me, eyes filling with hate and bitter tears. ""Maybe If I had been driving, I would have seen that drunk driver or not gone down that street to begin with. Who knows.""

""Why dwell on this past Robert."" I uttered. ""Why tell me all this, look at you, you need to collect yourself for tomorrow when Clean comes."" I started. He just stared right past me. 

""It was going to be a girl."" he whispered, practically to himself. I simply sighed and told him to get some rest. I had no time for his drunken rambling; I needed to prepare to take over tomorrow. Today was supposed to be the day I turned it around, and made Barb fall in line. No more coddling it. 

If it didn't fall in line? Well, I had enough data. I could always start again. 

Of course, none of that happened. I arrived at the school this morning to find Clean waiting for me. He was with four armed men carrying rifles of some sort. He told me that Rob had been informed this morning that I would be taking over the project and that he was no longer needed.

 Evidently, he went ballistic. I reminded Clean that I told him Rob had been unstable, that Barb was dangerous. He scowled at me and informed that he was going to go in and take Barb by force. I told him it wasn't necessary she be taken whole and he grimaced at me. He signaled his men to follow him in and I went with, like the foolish man I am. 

Inside the School a small alarm was going off. crimson warning lights were flashing and the interns stood at their stations unsure of what to do. We quickly made our way through the facility to Barb's room. Outside was the guard with the tribal tattoos. He was on the ground, his head facing the wrong direction. The door to its room was slightly ajar. I could hear panicked whispering. 

""Rob? It's Doug Jones. Can you kindly step out of the project's room."" I commanded as respectfully as possible. 

""Go to hell Doug. She's not a project, she's alive. She's so much more than what she thought she was, and I won't let her become their puppet."" he screamed at me.

""He's delirious."" I said to Clean.  Now he spoke up.

""Mr. Walker please be reasonable. We do not want anyone else to be hurt. Is Mr. Lemmings in there with you?"" He asked. That was met with silence. ""Is he still alive?"" He said plainly.

""I-he had her on the ground, he was hurting her. The gun was right there so I-""

""Was protecting her. I understand that. I'm a father myself, Mr. Walker. It's just the two of you in there then?""

""Please just let me and my dad go sir; I just want to live."" I heard it cry out like a frightened animal. Rob tried to sooth it, but it kept making these ugly sobbing noises.

 ""Can we get on with it."" I said to Clean. He looked like he wanted to say something to me, but then just shook his head. He turned to his men and said-

""Make it quick and clean, secure the asset alive if you can."" Alive, had Clean clung to this notion as well? Were my superiors just as mad as Rob? 

The four men rushed in as both Rob and Barb started to loudly protest. There were commands of getting on the ground and I heard several shots go off. It screamed ""daddy, daddy please get up"" as I heard something lump to the ground. 

More scuffling, a loud thump against the door. Someone yelled to hold her down, then more screaming followed by an uncomfortable crunching noise. It sounded like metal being scrapped against an eraser board. 

Then more disgusting sounds and moans of pain. I glanced at the door and saw splatters of blood and some sort of blue substance on the ground. The blood was starting to pool as one final voice pleaded and was met with a chorus of rhematic thuds. 

The thuds turned into hard squelches and quickly replaced with an abhorrent cry. A Voice cried out, slightly high pitched and like it had been processed through a broken voice filter. It was asking why, why we made her do that.

Clean shifted uneasily and peaked in. As he did, he suddenly shot backward and was pinned to the wall behind me. He was twitching there, blood slowly dripping down his skull. It had thrown something at him; it looked like a gun ripped in half. 

It had pinned him there like a makeshift spear. It had pierced him right in the left eye. Perfect marksmanship. The crying imitation started once more. Now it was repeating the phrase ""daddy daddy please-please move."" over and over again. I Peaked in despite my better judgment.

It was a horrific massacre. Bodies were in various states of dismemberment, blood splattering all over the walls. In the middle was Rob, being cradled by the thing he called daughter. It was damaged, skin rapped off its arm exposing a smooth metallic shell. Blue coolant covered its face as a deep scratch mark was on its neck. 

I stood their frozen, at the horror I had helped create. This thing was massively unstable; it had to be put down. I eyed a sill usable rifle on the ground next to me. I started to reach towards it, and it must have seen me out of the corner of my eye. 

It instantly sprang up with a roar. It grabbed me and threw me against a wall. I felt my back shatter instantly. I winced through the pain and tried to keep alert as it walked towards me, murderous notion in its eye. 

""You."" It began to speak with such venom. ""You always hated me. You thought I was just a thing, a little toy you could fiddle around with during your exams."" It spoke. 

""I-I was just being thorough."" I tried to explain. 

""LIAR."" It screamed at me as it stomped on my ankle. This time I did cry out as it dug its heels into my leg. I could hear the scrape of the metal as it tore through the tendon, ripping it beyond repair. 

""You wanted this, you wanted daddy out of the way so you could just do whatever you wanted. The bald man wanted to use me to fight wars. Well, what about what I want?"" It proclaimed. Against my better judgment, I tried to appeal to it.

""So, what do you want then, Barbara?"" I asked. That gave it pause. It titled its head, looking at me like prey. 

""I'll think about it while I'm digging around inside you for a change."" It said, reaching down to grab my stomach. I braced myself for the pain when I heard a voice call out quietly.

 ""Barb... "" It was Rob. I glanced over to him. He was sitting up; I could see at least one slug in his shoulder. He was breathing heavily, clinging to life. ""Don't do it honey. . . He's not worth it."" The thing just stood there for a moment. Obviously processing the request. Finally, it replied.

""Yes Daddy."" it walked away from me, stepping in the blood of those men it slaughtered. It picked up Rob as gracefully as it could. It turned to me one more time before I blacked out. It simply said. ""Don't look for us.""

I awoke several hours later in a hospital bed. In front of me were several men in suits who had some very serious questions. It turns out Mr. Clean was not so clean himself, running this whole thing off the books.

 I was repeatedly asked what had happened to Walker and the rouge asset and I had no real answer for them. They threatened me with a litany of charges, not the least of which was treason. 

They're bluffing obviously, because that would mean having to acknowledge that it exists in the first place. The first true Ai. It's out there now, maybe even repaired to full strength.

I write this as a warning, everything I did I did for the name of progress, but I should have known better. Beyond the black wall lay demons, my friends. 

And I helped create one. It will probably try to hunt me down if Walker expires, could have even changed its face to blend in better. It-

\-It could even be the nurse that just walked in. She has blonde hair, like that bitch Rob was raving about. 

 There's a small fork next to me, it came with the food they brought. I think I'll wait until her back is turned and finish it before it finishes me. 

It's the only way to be sure. ",1,1766164655.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,0.67,False

- I only ever drink espresso shots or flat white with oat milk.
- I have an 1zpresso X Ultra hand grinder
- Buying some fresh beans tomorrow
- I have a 1 cup Moka pot

I've found the coffee on the Moka pot comes out bitter. Followed the James Hoffman technique of using already boiled water and taking the pot off the stove when it starts to spur. Still bitter. FYI, was using grounded Starbucks coffee, so perhaps the bean quality is an issue.

Question:
Apart from buying a machine, is there any way I can make a good espresso at home?

Happy to buy something like an Aero press but it's not strictly espresso.

Ever since then, my parents have lived in constant fear that something bad might happen to me too. Now I’m 24, but they still try to monitor me everywhere I go.The other day, for example, I met someone new at a coffee shop. My parents insisted on knowing where I was while I was meeting this guy. It was frustrating—I wish they didn’t feel the need to know every detail of my personal life. But if I don’t tell them, they panic and threaten to call the police because they think I’m missing. Even though I’ve moved out of their house, they still pressure me to share my location wherever I am. While I was hanging out with the guy, they called me about five times. I didn’t know how to tell them to leave me alone, so I just answered and said, “I’ll talk to you later, bye.” But they kept blowing up my phone. At one point, we were in his car, kissing, when their calls started again. I finally picked up and told them the truth—that I was in his car—because I have a hard time lying. They immediately freaked out. I couldn’t handle it anymore, so I hung up and tried to just go back to spending time with him.The next morning, my dad berated me for hanging out in a stranger’s car. I tried to explain myself, but he didn’t listen. Instead, he kept throwing out statistics like, “Do you know that 91% of victims are women?” and yelling, “You could’ve gotten hurt—what the hell were you thinking?” I was furious but stayed quiet, knowing that arguing would only make things worse.I’m so frustrated with my parents. I wish they would understand that I’m not a little kid anymore. I’m 24—I don’t need to be monitored all the time. It feels invasive and exhausting. I don’t know what to do anymore. They refuse to go to family therapy, even though it might actually help.

1.5 Ounces Calvados 

0.5 Ounces Rye, aged in chocolate bitters barrels

0.5 Ounces Dry Curaçao 

0.75 Ounces Yellow Chartreuse 

2 Dashes Chocolate Bitters 

2 Dashes Five Spice Tincture*

1 Barspoon Demerara syrup


Method: 

Combine everything in a mixing glass, stir with ice for at least 30 to chill and dilute.  Strain over a large piece of ice, garnish with a precariously perched star anise, which will likely fall into your drink during the first sip. This is OK. It just wants to go swimming. 


Notes:  

This is a big, boozy, slow sipping delight. Anise hits the nose right away, followed by peppercorn and a pile of cinnamon. Light clove notes, which mingle wonderfully with the orange,  herbal notes, warm chocolate, and baking spices. Sweetness comes off initially as slightly austere, which is why I balanced it with just a little bit of Demerara, which also lends a warm molasses note. All of the spices from the tincture, the xocolatl bitters, and the chartreuse play beautifully with the spice and heat from the rye, and the calvados provides warm wood and gorgeous complexity. 

This all lingers on the palate for ages.  

This took a number of iterations to arrive at, with a number of other spirit pairings and liqueurs before I hit on this, with the yellow chartreuse doing a lot behind the scenes to tie everything together. 

Five Spice Tincture Recipe:
In a small Mason jar, combine the following:

~5g each ( I ended up run 29g total)
Fennel seed

Star anise

Szechuan peppercorns

Cinnamon

Clove

4.5oz everclear

( minimum wage)","Want to start off by saying I am aware my actions were stupid but I was desperate for a job which is why I put up with this. Also trying to keep this extremely short. I appreciate all responses even if its to tell me I don't have a case. 

Worked as a closer at a coffee shop. Shift was 9 hours. I was by myself 4-5 depending on when other person left. Worked there for about a year and a half. 

I was not paid if I stayed past closing time. I kept being told other ppl were able to leave at that time so I should be able to as well. So for example if store closed at 7pm, I should be done on closing duties by 7pm. I was not being paid to stay after. 

Manager/owner started complaining that I was closing up too early. Things like dumping doughnuts, turning off toaster were being done last 20 minutes of shift, and turning off opening sign . I told him that this wasn't fair and I cant give full customer service and get out on time. He kept telling me other ppl could. I had put up with this before but to keep a long story short I finally snapped and told him I was staying sometimes 20-30 minutes unpaid to finish things and if I didn't close things up earlier then I would be staying 40 minutes later. 

The mistake I made was I was always logging off on time. Because I was embarrassed to be staying 30 minutes late ( there are cameras in store as well as gas station across street). I kept convincing myself I was the issue but in reality I wasn't. There is no way to leave a closing shift exactly when a store closes. I was desperate to keep this job I couldn't afford to quit. And honestly I was hoping something would open up in the morning so I could get on that shift. 

I dont know what evidence I can even present. Because if an agent asks my boss then he has to tell him that he doesn't pay people who stay after closing. Like literally all the agent ( if they choose to investigate this), has to do is talk to current staff. Should I be trying to get video evidence from the gas station showing what time I left?

The whole reason why I ended up quitting this job is because of this staying late/closing early thing.   Which was not an easy decision to make in this job market. This job also did not have unpaid breaks. Meaning, if someone came to the window I had to help them. There was not designsted 15 minuted uninterrupted break time and that was starting to wear me down as well.

You don't have to pack up your patio furniture just because temperatures drop.

**Size Matters for Your Space**

The size of your outdoor area determines what type of heater works best. For small patios or balconies, tabletop heaters give you focused warmth without taking up floor space. Medium-sized decks work well with freestanding tower heaters that can warm a 10-15 foot radius. Large patios and outdoor dining areas need powerful pyramid-style heaters or wall-mounted units.

**Fuel Types to Consider**

Propane patio heaters are the most popular choice because they're portable and provide instant heat. You can move them around your deck or patio as needed. Electric heaters work great if you have outdoor outlets nearby - they're quieter and don't need fuel refills. Natural gas heaters offer the most cost-effective heating but require professional installation.

**Heat Output and Coverage**

Look at BTU ratings when shopping for outdoor heaters. Small spaces need around 30,000-40,000 BTUs, while larger areas require 40,000+ BTUs for effective warming. The higher the BTU rating, the more space your heater can warm effectively.

**Safety Features**

Modern patio heaters come with important safety features like tip-over protection and automatic shut-off valves. These features prevent accidents if the heater gets knocked over or if gas flow is interrupted.

**Weather Resistance**

Your outdoor heater needs to handle wind, rain, and temperature changes. Look for models with wind-resistant designs and weatherproof materials. Stainless steel and powder-coated finishes last longer in outdoor conditions.

Turns out I was completely wrong. The harsh truth? Most of us are working our asses off but still broke because nobody taught us what to actually do with our paychecks once they hit our account.

I went down a rabbit hole studying how wealthy people think about money after watching Kevin O'Leary's interviews and reading books by actual finance experts, not just generic hustle porn. What I found changed everything about how I handle money. This isn't some get rich quick BS, it's the actual playbook wealthy people use that schools never teach us.

**1. Pay yourself first, not last**

This is Kevin O'Leary's main thing and it sounds simple but most people do it backwards. The second your paycheck hits, automatically move money into investments before you pay anything else. Not after rent, not after your car payment, FIRST.

Set up automatic transfers so you never even see that money. Start with 10% of your income if you can, even 5% is fine. The key is making it automatic so you're not relying on willpower at the end of the month when there's mysteriously no money left.

Most people treat savings like a leftover, like ""oh I'll save whatever's remaining after I live my life."" That's why they never save anything. Your future self needs to be a bill you pay, not an afterthought.

**2. Make your money work harder than you do**

Here's the thing that blew my mind. Rich people don't work for money, they make their money work for them. Every dollar you invest is like a little employee working 24/7 generating more money.

Kevin O'Leary talks about this constantly. He sees every purchase as either moving him closer to financial freedom or further away. That $6 coffee? That's potential investment money that could be growing.

I'm not saying never enjoy your money, but start thinking about opportunity cost. When you buy something, you're not just spending that amount, you're spending what that money could have grown into over 10, 20, 30 years.

**The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel** is insanely good for understanding this mindset shift. Housel is a partner at The Collaborative Fund and former columnist at WSJ. This book breaks down why we're so irrational with money and how to actually build wealth. It's not about complex strategies, it's about behavior. The chapter on compounding alone will make you rethink every financial decision you've ever made. This is the best finance book I've ever read and it's not even close.

**3. Create multiple income streams**

You can't 10x your income working one job no matter how many hours you put in. There's a ceiling. Wealthy people have money coming in from multiple sources.

This doesn't mean you need to start 5 businesses tomorrow. Start small. Invest in dividend paying stocks, that's passive income. Rent out a room on Airbnb. Freelance your skills on the side. Create a digital product. Buy index funds that pay dividends.

The goal is to stop trading time for money exclusively. You only have so many hours in a day. But money? Money can work around the clock.

**4. Track every dollar like your life depends on it**

This sounds boring as hell but it's the foundation. You cannot improve what you don't measure. Kevin O'Leary says he tracks every single expense and most millionaires do the same thing.

Use an app like Monarch Money or even just a spreadsheet. Track where every dollar goes for one month. Most people are shocked when they realize how much money disappears on subscriptions they forgot about or daily purchases that add up to thousands yearly.

Once you see the numbers clearly, you can make informed decisions instead of just vaguely feeling broke all the time.

**5. Invest in assets, not liabilities**

Assets put money in your pocket. Liabilities take money out. Sounds obvious but most people spend their whole lives buying liabilities thinking they're assets.

A new car? Liability. Loses value the second you drive it off the lot. A rental property? Asset. Generates monthly income. Latest iPhone? Liability. Index funds? Asset.

Before you buy anything expensive, ask yourself, will this make me money or cost me money long term? This one filter will save you from so many financial mistakes.

**Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki** explains this concept better than anything else I've read. Yeah yeah, it's recommended everywhere, but there's a reason. Kiyosaki built his wealth through real estate and investments, and this book sold over 40 million copies because it genuinely changes how you see money. The asset vs liability framework is simple but revolutionary. It will make you question everything you think you know about what's worth buying.

**6. Increase your income ceiling through skills**

While you're building passive income, still focus on increasing your active income. The more you earn, the more you can invest, the faster you build wealth.

Invest in skills that directly increase your market value. Learn high income skills like sales, marketing, coding, design, copywriting. Take courses, get certifications, become undeniably valuable.

Your earning potential is your most powerful wealth building tool when you're starting out. Don't neglect it while chasing passive income. Do both.

Founded by Columbia alumni and former Google experts, it's built on science-based personalization that evolves with you. Perfect for fitting real learning into commutes or workouts without the usual doomscroll.

**7. Understand compound interest like your financial future depends on it (because it does)**

Einstein allegedly called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. It's the difference between being comfortable and being wealthy.

If you invest $500 monthly starting at 25 with 8% average returns, you'll have over $1.7 million by 65. Start at 35? You'll have about $700k. That 10 year difference costs you a million dollars.

Time in the market beats timing the market every single time. The earlier you start, even with small amounts, the more explosive your growth.

**The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins** breaks down index fund investing in a way that finally made sense to me. Collins spent years writing about finance on his blog and this book is basically the ultimate guide to building wealth through index funds. No complicated strategies, just straightforward advice on how to actually build wealth. The section on why index funds beat almost everything else is gold.

**8. Stop trying to keep up with people who are probably broke anyway**

Social media has destroyed people's relationship with money. Everyone's faking wealth they don't have, going into debt to look rich.

That coworker with the new BMW? Probably financed it over 7 years and is drowning in payments. Your friend with the designer wardrobe? Could be maxing out credit cards.

Real wealth is invisible. It's in investment accounts, not Instagram posts. Stop comparing your financial situation to people's highlight reels. Focus on your own goals and block out the noise.

**9. Automate everything so you can't sabotage yourself**

Willpower is unreliable. Automate your finances so good financial decisions happen without you having to think about it.

Auto transfer to savings. Auto invest in index funds. Auto pay bills. Auto everything.

Remove the human element (your broke, impulsive self) from the equation as much as possible. Set it up once and let the system run.

**10. Think in decades, not days**

Building real wealth takes time. You're not going to 10x your income in 6 months unless you win the lottery or get incredibly lucky.

But if you consistently apply these principles, pay yourself first, invest regularly, increase your skills, create multiple income streams, in 5, 10, 15 years your financial situation will be unrecognizable.

The people who win financially aren't necessarily smarter or more talented. They're just more patient and consistent.

Kevin O'Leary didn't get rich overnight. Neither did Warren Buffett or any other wealthy person. They played the long game while everyone else chased quick wins.

Your income potential is way higher than you think. But it requires completely rewiring how you think about and handle money. Stop working hard for money and start making money work hard for you.",4,1766163933.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

My wife (27) has worked at her current place for honestly only a few months. Its a 'manager barista' job at a small coffee shop. Its a cool place, the owner is really nice and generous.

My wife works incredibly hard and is a great employee to have. Her boss/owner has noticed this and has given her honestly a lot of cash just as a thankyou. All great stuff. I go in there about an hour before shes off to just chill and talk to everyone. They're all super nice etc.

This issue is: this job was only a temporary thing as we want to move closer to her family, buy a house and start our own family. This is the furthest we've been from them since we got together 6 years ago. Them being close to our eventual children is incredibly important to us. 

Our plan was to move in with her parents (who genuinely want us to live with them, we've lived with them before to help them out and we all genuinely get along. its great), save as much as we can, pay off our debts and buy a house as soon as we can. We're looking at 6-15 months.

this is where it kinda gets crazy?
Her boss initially offered to pay our rent for a year so we can save. Hes incredibly wealthy and generous so i know he's being serious.. but no. having your boss essentially be your landlord is insane. 

We told him no, then a week later he offered to pay her debt AND pay our rent for a year... dude... no.. its nice but NO

THEN, on monday when i went in to pick her up. he talked to us BOTH for over an hour about how we NEED to consider this etc etc. dude....  AND THEN TOLD US HE WOULD BUY US A HOUSE AND WE CAN JUST PAY HIM THE MORTGAGE EVERY MONTH. its getting insane.

we told him no again and now today she calls me and says he wants to talk to us again today about the offer because we would be making a mistake.

Hes a nice person but im getting to my witts end and its causing my wife to be incredibly anxious about going into work now because hes simply not stopping. How in the world to i flat out tell him this is becoming too much. We're both flaming empaths and people-pleasers so its a bit outside both of our wheelhouses. I've just never experienced anything like this. It's incredibly rude, unprofessional and inappropriate


EDIT: LOL just putting it out there, hes for SURE not trying to sleep with her! haha i do appreciate the concern. He's a VERY happily married 60+ year old and devout Muslim.. He was once the press secretary for Yemen before the collapse and he had to flee to America, i promise hes just loaded and likes to do nice things for his employees. The area we live currently, the bar is just really fucking low and shes just that good of a worker. For context, my wife was asked to look through applicants for their new position and every single applicant (around 30)  had a felony history

EDIT: I feel like i should maybe elaborate a bit more on why we dont want to take the offer.. We did consider it, however there 100% will be 'invisible strings' attached to his offer. One of our biggest concerns were: a year is a long time and a lot of things can happen. What if they have a falling-out within that time... does he kick us out? do we just live in a awkward limbo?

Even if we took the offer, we plan on moving closer to her family - seeing how hes acting now, can you guys imagine how he'd react if after a year and him paying for things we say ""BYE!""? in theory it all sounds good but this isnt our path

EDIT: more context, I WFH and get paid decently well and my company gives insane benefits. Moving to her parents, we will already be saving our money and be living rent free.... Moving to her parents is essentially the same deal minus the $3k check or whatever for her credit cards just without the maximum possible levels of anxiety.",40,1766163851.0,careerguidance,112,0.9,False
1pqqcpo,https://i.redd.it/om921kcsz68g1.jpeg,Long time no see - I’m baking again (new direction),"Hey everyone,

Some of you might remember me from a few years back when I was baking low-carb, low-sugar desserts designed to be easier on blood sugar, using simple ingredients with no gums, emulsifiers, or artificial colors or flavors — without sacrificing flavor.

I wanted to share a quick update, since a few people from this community have reached out over the years asking if I’d ever bake again.

For those who were around back then: this community really shaped that first chapter. What started as a nervous post turned into working with local neighbors, supporting community events, and fundraising for causes that mattered to me. I’m genuinely grateful for how welcoming Astoria was during that time.

I had to stop for health reasons. I learned that I have significant environmental and ingredient sensitivities and combined with long-term side effects from past cancer treatment, I genuinely didn’t know how I could safely interact with the world for a while. It took time to figure things out.

I’m back now, but with a very different concept.

I’ve started a small, local cookie project focused on luxury ingredients and obsessive sourcing. Fewer items, done extremely well.

The first cookie is a coffee butter chocolate chip cookie, made with: 

\* chocolate sourced from a single place in North America

\* Vietnamese coffee sourced from a single café in North America that imports small-batch beans directly from Vietnam

\* a butter-forward dough (not low-carb this time)

Right now, the cookies are available locally in NYC (currently stocked at a café in Manhattan), and I also do very limited direct orders.

Because it’s Christmas, I’m taking a short break from Wednesday to Saturday, but I’m accepting orders for local delivery on Monday/Tuesday (12/22–12/23), which works out perfectly for Christmas, and again from Sunday (12/28) through the New Year. I bake everything myself and handle local delivery in Astoria / Long Island City.

Since this community supported me early on, I wanted to reconnect here. I’m posting from my old account just to say hi, but if you’d like to follow what I’m doing now, place any holiday orders, or inquire about specialty orders, you can find me on Instagram @forte.ny, and my new Reddit account is u/forte-ny . My DMs are open.

I’m still experimenting and figuring things out, but I’d love to offer things like New Year cookie boxes for gatherings. I’m currently working on the next cookie for the Fire Horse New Year, and if there’s enough local interest, I might also do a small taste-test party for people nearby.

No pressure at all — just grateful to be here, baking again, and thankful for this space.

Love,

“Ladies and gentlemen, please put your tray tables up and seats into the upright position in preparation for our landing at the Sheremetyevo Airport...”

Elaine peered out the window.  It was very early morning, but still dark outside.  She could make out the farmland below, covered in snow.  She could even see some of the so-called “dachas” dotting the countryside, massive brick mansions standing half-finished and abandoned.  She remembered Nick telling her about them, leaning over her, looking out the window, his cheek almost touching hers.

*The Russian Mafia built those things after the Soviet Union collapsed.  Then the gang wars started, and they killed each other off before the dachas were even finished.*

Elaine told herself not to think of Nick.  She said a silent prayer for him, hoping that wherever he was, he was all right.

The big aircraft soon landed and rolled to a stop at the gate.  When the stewardess opened the door, Elaine was one of the first passengers to deplane.  She knew there would be a big line at Passport Control and wanted to get through it as soon as possible so as not to keep the Secret Service agents waiting for her.

As she stepped out into the gate area, there were two men in gray suits and trench coats watching everyone who walked by.  She could spot the Secret Service image a mile off.  She was surprised—she hadn’t expected them to meet her right here at the gate.  That really was VIP treatment.

The eyes of one of the men locked on her face.

She stepped up and offered her hand.  “Elaine Brogan.  Thanks for meeting me, guys.”

The man grabbed her wrist and the other one took hold of her arm.  “US Secret Service.  Come along quietly, please.”

“What are you—wait a minute—”

“Move along,” the man on the left said, his arm tightening. “We don’t want any trouble.”

“My name is Elaine *Brogan*.  Aren’t you with the Secret Service?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

They were moving her towards a door on the corridor marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.  Struggling against their grip, she said, “You’re supposed to meet me and take me to my hotel.”

The two men exchanged glances, and one of them chuckled. “You’re going to a hotel, all right.  One with bars on all the windows.”   He keyed in a code and then they forced her through the door.  They continued down a corridor.

Elaine was suddenly panic-stricken.  *They must have gotten me confused with someone else*.  

They took her through a door marked *DOPROC*.   She was well versed in Russian, and she knew that word:  Interrogation.

Elaine was terrified.

The windowless room had a long, scarred rectangular table with a few metal folding chairs surrounding it.  Some empty coffee cups and ragged looking Russian newspapers were scattered about.

“You’re in deep shit,” one of them said.   He was taller and older than the other one, and had a pockmarked face.

“Hand it over,” the younger man said.

Elaine looked at them, bewildered.  “Hand *what* over?”

“Look, we know you took it, so you can stop the innocent act.  You can voluntarily give it to us, or we’ll strip search you.”

“And that won’t be fun,” the other man said, with a smile.  “At least, not for you.”

Elaine swallowed, looking from one face to another.  What in the world was happening to her?  This didn’t make any sense.

“Look, my name is Elaine Brogan, and I work for—”

“Give me your bags,” the pockmarked man said, and wrenched both away from her. He dumped out the contents of both her handbag and suitcase onto the table.  

“You’re really screwing up,” she said, trying to maintain her composure.  “I’ll have you both fired.”

When it was evident that whatever they were looking for was not in the bags, both men looked back at her.

“I told you you were making a mistake,” Elaine snapped.  “Now would one of you kindly call your office and—”

“Strip, lady.”

Elaine recoiled.  “I *beg* your pardon?”

The pockmark-faced man nodded to the younger one.  “Give me your knife.”  He looked at Elaine as he slowly drew out the blade, the silver glinting in fluorescent lights.

Elaine was paralyzed with fear.  These two were out of control.  They could do whatever they wanted with her in this interrogation room—there were no cameras that she could see, no two-way mirrors.

The man picked up her suitcase and opened it wide.  She winced as the knife cut through the lining.

“You’re going to pay for that suitcase,” she said, her mouth dry.

Her eyes widened as the man withdrew a sleek black cylinder.  It was the “salt shaker,” the high capacity data key for the project she had just finished.  It contained all the data—the fourteen common mistakes in the counterfeits, hundreds of super high resolution scans of the fake banknotes, the three crucial errors that the new software would look for.  In short, all the research data that had been used to create the software updates.

Elaine’s heart went into her throat.  

“You’re under arrest,” he said flatly.  “Gene Lassiter told us this was missing from his safe yesterday afternoon. You can look forward to twenty years in a federal penitentiary, with no chance of parole.”  

The other man produced a plastic EVIDENCE bag and he dropped it in, and he started writing on the label.

“Somebody planted that there!” 

“Sure, lady.”

“I’m being framed!”

“Uh-huh.”

The room was spinning.  Elaine’s mind raced from one thought to another.  Somebody had set her up.  Gene Lassiter.  It had to be Lassiter!  No one else had the combination to his safe...

Then she remembered what had taken place in his office yesterday, when he was slumped on his couch.

*Would you get me my pills, Elaine?  They’re in my desk.*

She had opened every one of his desk drawers!  Her fingerprints were all over them.

She pulled her phone from her pocket.  She had to call someone— Nick?

The pockmarked man snatched it from her hand.  “You’re not making any calls.” He set it down on the corner of the table, far out of her reach.

The two men stepped over to the other side of the room out of earshot, talking to each other in low voices.  This couldn’t be...how could Lassiter have done this to her?

Elaine was only dimly aware of the men’s conversation—she felt like her ears were filled with cotton, and the voices were far away.

“...the extradition papers...”

“...hold her at the American Embassy while...”

“...they’ll want to fly her back to D.C. on a diplomatic jet for formal charging...”

*This can’t be happening*, she thought dazedly.  *This can’t be happening.*

The two men walked over to the door.  “Keep your ass in that chair,” the one with the evidence bag said, pointing at her.  They both went outside and pulled the door shut behind them.

A sense of unreality swept over her.  Elaine gaped at her open suitcase, all her personal items scattered around the table.  

*You’ll spend the next twenty years in a federal penitentiary, with no chance of parole.*

She saw herself wearing numbered orange coveralls, standing in line holding a metal food tray, shuffling around with shackles on her wrists and ankles...

Just like her father.

Elaine’s eyes were drawn to a clock on the wall.  She watched the red needle of the second hand slowly move around the face.  Twenty *years* in prison.  She suddenly stood up, her vision blurred.  There was a sink in the corner.  She rushed over to it and vomited.  

As she wiped her mouth, she realized how quiet it was in the room.  And then she looked at the can of hair spray, the hair brush...she could assemble her gun.  Maybe she could escape.

Then she again noticed how quiet the room was.  Suddenly, she heard men’s voices out in the corridor.  They were laughing, speaking Russian.

She looked over at the door.  The handle turned.

Elaine quickly sat back down.

Several huge Russian men sauntered into the room.  They were all wearing blue Aeroflot coveralls, with photo ID badges clipped to their pockets.  Each man held a steaming paper cup in his hand.   They stopped talking when they saw Elaine.

“*Kto ti*?” one of them said, staring.  *Who are you?*

“Who are you?”

One of them turned and muttered, “*Americanka*,” to the others.  The whole group sipped their coffee, watching her.

“I think you should not be here,” another man said, in thickly accented English.  “This secure area of airport.”

“*Puskai ostayotcia, ona ochen krasivaya*” another said.  *Let her stay, she’s very beautiful.* 

The men all chuckled good-naturedly.  They just stood there, drinking their coffee, smiling at her.  

Elaine glanced at the open door.  The sign that had said DOPROC had disappeared.

“Where am I?” she said, standing up.

They glanced at each other, puzzled.

“You are in the Aeroflot baggage handler recreation room.”  The man smiled.  “Would you like some coffee?”



\* \* \*

Elaine madly threw all her things back into her suitcase, then banged out through the door that opened onto the main concourse, her mind racing.  

The two men weren’t with the Secret Service—they were with the Russian Mafia!  She’d been tricked and let them get away with the data key.  

Lassiter had used her to transport the data key out of the United States.  He must have sold it to the Russian Mafia.

It was unbelievable to her, but it was the only logical explanation.

She had to get it back.  It was the only way she could stop herself from being framed.  If she could recover it, she could take it back to Washington and go to the highest authorities—to the Executive Treasurer, or the Director of the Secret Service.  She could explain everything that had happened—surely they would believe her.

As she ran down the concourse toward Passport Control, she mentally recounted everything that had happened yesterday in Lassiter’s office.  A demonstration at the Bank of Russia?  For all she knew, there was no demonstration—the project was so top secret the only information she ever received was directly from Lassiter’s mouth.  Furthermore, she had no evidence that he had told her he was going to Russia, or that she had agreed to go in his place!  She had bought the plane ticket herself, with her own credit card—a one-way ticket!  

My god, she thought—I looked as if I fled the USA with no intention of ever coming back!

When Elaine reached the sprawling Passport Control area, she found it packed with hundreds of weary travelers, waiting in endless queues.  The two Russian thieves had probably left the airport some other way.  It would be a miracle if she could get that data key back now...

Far ahead, Elaine could see the staffed booths: RUSSIAN PASSPORTS, EU PASSPORTS, ALL OTHER PASSPORTS.  At the very far side of the room, she spotted another booth: DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS/VIP SERVICE.  There was no queue in front of it.

Elaine dashed in that direction and fished out her fake Irish diplomatic passport from the hidden slot in her suitcase.  When she slid it under the window of the booth, the uniformed male Russian officer opened it and peered at it as she stood there, catching her breath.

O’NEILL, SHANNON, the name read.  The seal of the Irish Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was clearly visible on the pale gray paper.

“And how long vil you be in Russia?” the officer asked slowly, rolling the r in Russia.

“Just a wee time, a few days,” Elaine said, turning on her Irish accent.   She glanced beyond the partition, into Baggage Claim*.  Come on*, she thought*.  Hurry up!*

The officer looked closely at Elaine’s face, then peered at the passport again.  Finally, he picked up a heavy stamp and *ka-thumped* it on one of the open pages.  “Enjoy your stay.”

Elaine rushed from the booth and entered the baggage area, then headed straight down the hallway marked GREEN LINE – NOTHING TO DECLARE, rolling her suitcase along behind her.  When she emerged into the airport lobby, there were throngs of people huddled around the exit from Customs—men, women, children, many holding bouquets, their eyes anxiously scanning the arriving passengers for their loved ones.

Elaine pushed ahead, tripping over people and luggage, frantically searching for the two men who had conned her.  She was immediately accosted by a gaggle of leather-clad taxi drivers.

“Cheap taxi to center!”

“Very low price—”

“One hundred dollars—”

“New Mercedes, very comfortable—”

“Get out of my way,” Elaine snapped, plowing through them.  

She followed the signs to ground transportation.  When she stepped out onto the sidewalk, she was struck by a blast of cold air that chilled her to the bone—the temperature was well below zero.  It was still dark outside, and the parking lot was covered with snow.

Elaine desperately scanned the lot for the men, peering into the windows of the passing vehicles.

*They’re probably long gone by now*, she thought, terror-stricken.  *What I am going to do?*

She desperately tried to think of someone who could help her, but the only person that came to mind was Nick.  And he was in jail somewhere.

Then, across the parking lot, she spotted the man with the pockmarked face.  He was unlocking the door of a large black SUV.  The other man was not with him.

“Taxi?” a voice said from behind her.

Elaine whirled around, afraid it was the second man.  But it was only a taxi driver, in the usual Russian taxi driver outfit—a cheap-looking brown faux leather jacket, a plaid scarf, and a black driver’s cap.  He looked harmless—big, but with stooped over shoulders.  He had sad eyes that reminded her of a basset hound’s.

“I give very good price to center,” he said, vapor pluming from his mouth.  “Ninety dollars.  My car not so good—” he pointed to a little beat-up Lada that was splattered with brown slush,”— but price very good.”  

The black SUV was pulling away now.

“Fine, let’s go,” she said, moving towards his car.

The big man moved surprisingly fast for his size.   He rushed over to the Lada and opened the passenger door for her, throwing the front seat forward.  She climbed into the back of the cramped little Russian-made vehicle.

He got in and started the engine.  “Which hotel?”

“See that black SUV?” Elaine said, pointing.

“Jeep?”

“Yes, jeep.”  She had forgotten that’s what Russians called all SUVs.  “Follow the jeep.”

As he pulled away, Elaine nervously glanced around the inside of the car, taking everything in, sizing him up.  Attached to the dashboard was a square icon of Mary Magdalene.  Next to it was a clipboard with color flyers for nightclubs, photos of scantily clad women on the front. In the compartment below, a dog-eared road atlas and a couple of short fishing poles, the type used for ice fishing.  

She didn’t think he was anything other than what he appeared to be, an independent taxi driver.  

The SUV was picking up speed.  It soon disappeared around the ramp that led to the highway.

“Don’t lose it,” Elaine said, her voice trembling.

The driver glanced at Elaine again.  “If you will simply say which hotel —”

“I don’t know which hotel!”  Elaine tried to think of a reasonable sounding explanation.   “That’s my friend, I don’t know where he’s going.  Okay?”

“Okay,” the driver said, looking skeptical.

Elaine was too preoccupied with recovering the data key to think up excuses for a taxi driver. She checked out the back window to make sure they were not being followed.  The road was clear behind them.

They soon caught up with the SUV.

“Hang back,” Elaine said.

“*Shto*?”  the driver said.

“Stay behind the jeep, but don’t lose it.”  Elaine wasn’t sure if he understood.  “*Panyatno*?”

“*Panyatno*,” he said, glancing at her again in the rearview.  He knew something strange was going on.

Elaine was frantically trying to think of a way to stop the SUV.   She didn’t have much time, she had to act *now*.  She considered calling the Moscow Secret Service field office and trying to explain what had happened, but it was too risky.  Lassiter might have already called them, telling them she had stolen the data key.   At this point, she couldn’t trust anyone.

Elaine opened her suitcase and began assembling the Sig Sauer, keeping it out of the driver’s sight.  At least she still had the gun.

They came to a cloverleaf—the SUV took the ramp that said MOSCOW – CENTRE.  

The driver kept looking at Elaine in the rearview—he had heard the clicking of the pistol as she snapped it together.

Suddenly, he pulled a cellphone from his pocket and began punching in a number with his thumb.

“*Ne zvonite telefon*,” Elaine said, alarmed.

He gazed at her through the mirror, hesitating, his finger poised over the keypad.  

She pressed the gun barrel against the back of his neck.  “I said no telephone calls.  Put the goddam phone down in the passenger seat.”

He quickly tossed the device over into the other seat and raised both his hands in the air.  He stared at her through the rearview, the basset hound eyes wide and frightened.  

“Keep steering!” she said, as the car started to veer into the other lane.

He put his hands back on the wheel, but he looked so nervous Elaine was afraid he would panic.  She pulled out her Treasury Department badge and held it up so he could see it through the rearview.  Speaking Russian slowly and carefully, she said, “I am a special police agent from America.  I will not harm you.  Just do your job and follow that jeep.”  She paused, then added, “If you do well, I will give you a big tip.”

He looked even more frightened.  

Elaine was confused...then realized that she had used the wrong word for “tip,” which was a variant of the Russian word for tea.  She had told him that if he did a good job, she would give him a big tea kettle.

“I meant extra money,” she said, rubbing her fingers together.  “*Dengi*.  Understand?”

“Ah.”  He gave a nervous smile.  “Extra money good.” He watched her for a moment through the mirror.  “It is very exciting for me to help American FBI.  I like exciting life.  My life very borink.”

*He thinks I’m an FBI agent,* Elaine thought.   *Let him think that.*

“My name is Dmitry.  What is your name?” 

“Janet,” she lied, saying the first name that came into her head.

“Janyet.  This is nice American name.”

Now they were in heavy traffic and were coming to the first stoplights they had encountered since leaving the airport. If she waited much longer, the man in the jeep might meet someone else, and then it might be impossible to get the key back.  She considered jumping out of the car, running up to the SUV, and trying to catch the driver by surprise.  She could smash the window open and put the gun to his neck...but the windows might be bulletproof—the Russian Mafia was famous for its heavily armored vehicles.  On top of that, dozens of people in other cars would see her.  If someone called the police, no telling what would happen.

“I help you, Janyet,” Dmitry said, breaking into Elaine’s thoughts.  “If you want.”

She studied his face as he gazed up at her through the rearview.  She wasn’t sure she could trust him.  Pushing the barrel a little harder into his neck, she said, “Who were you going to call on your phone?”

He raised his hands innocently.  “I only call my wife.  She worry when I working all night.”  He looked ahead at the SUV again, shaking his head.  “I hate Mafia! I *honest* taxi driver,” he said emphatically, pronouncing the “h” in honest.  “Mafia no let me go inside airport, take all my customers.”  He paused.  “I have daughter.  She study at Moscow State University to be doctor.”  There was great pride in his voice.  “I wish American FBI come and kill all Mafia, like on television!”

“That’s a task for your police,” Elaine muttered.

“Our police?”  He gave a big belly laugh.  “Our police, Mafia, same thing.”  Dmitry raised both his big paws in the air.  “All one big Mafia.”

“Do you really want to help me?” she asked.

“*Da*, Janyet.  I already say I want help you.”  He paused.  “For little extra money, of course...”

“Then listen very carefully...”



\* \* \*

When she finished explaining her plan, Dmitry’s face turned pale.

“Janyet...this very dangerous.  If I do what you say, this man in jeep will kill me.”

“He won’t kill you.  He’s not interested in you, Dmitry.  Trust me.  He’ll tell you to go away.”

Dmitry swallowed, staring through the windshield at the SUV.  It was only one hundred feet ahead of them now.  They had just crossed the Moscow River.  The traffic had thickened.  The sky was showing the first violet hues of dawn.

“You ask too much, Janyet.”

“I thought you told me you wanted some excitement in your life?”

Dmitry, winced, looking like he sorely regretted those words.

“I’ll pay you well,” Elaine said, remembering the cash she had with her.  “Very well.”

She could see temptation in his eyes.  Making the sign of the cross over his chest, he pressed on the accelerator and closed in on the SUV.

Elaine rolled down the back window, raising the pistol.  The frigid wind whipped across her cheeks.  The SUV was in the left-hand lane, tailgating the car in front of it.  They were easing up on the right-hand side. 

“Closer!” Elaine shouted, over the wind*.  I hope to God this works*, she thought.  As they neared the SUV, she aimed the gun at its spinning back tire.  

“Closer!” she said.  She wasn’t taking any chances.

Dmitry pressed a little harder on the gas.  Now the jeep’s rear wheel was almost within reach of her arm.

Elaine pulled the trigger.  

The tire exploded, then made a *flop-flop-flop* sound as the rubber began to shred.

Dmitry hit the brakes and let the SUV swerve in front of them.

“Now!” she said.

“*Bozhe moi*,” Dmitry muttered, then let up on the brake.  Two seconds later the front end of the Lada slammed into the rear of the SUV.  It was enough to throw Elaine forward but not enough to do any serious damage to either vehicle.

Both cars came to a stop on the shoulder of the road.  Elaine ducked down to the floorboard.  Dmitry reluctantly opened his door.  He looked terrified when he saw the big, pockmark-faced man open the door of the SUV and lumber towards him, scowling.

“*Durak*!” the man shouted.  “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“You stopped too fast,” Dmitry said in Russian, walking cautiously towards him.  “I—I was not prepared...”  

The man stepped behind the SUV and peered down at the flat tire, cursing.

“I’ll help you change it,” Dmitry said, with no enthusiasm at all.

The man opened the SUV’s rear door.  “Get the hell out of here.”

Dmitry did not need any more persuasion.  He quickly walked back towards the Lada. 

While they were talking, Elaine had slipped out of the car.  She was squatting behind the Lada’s bumper.  Traffic was passing by, some of the cars honking.  

As soon as the man bent down and tried to fit the jack under the car, she dashed forward.  

The next thing the man knew, the barrel of the Sig Sauer was pressing into the back of his head.

“Lie face down on the ground,” Elaine barked, adrenaline pumping through her veins.  Pushing him down into the gravel, she grabbed both his arms and pulled them behind his back.  She felt around and felt inside his jacket.  There was a pistol in one pocket.  She pulled it out and flung the weapon down the embankment, into the snow.  In the other pocket, she found the data key.

“You’re dead,” he said, as she pocketed it.

She leapt off him and backed up towards the Lada.  “Stay on the ground!” she said, but he climbed to his feet.  There was a noxious sheen in his eyes.

Dmitry had the Lada’s passenger door open for her.  Just as she reached it, the man suddenly bent and plucked something from his ankle.  An instant later the object was flipping end over end through the air towards Elaine, end over end, metal glinting in car headlights.  

The stiletto tore through Elaine’s wool coat and pierced her side.

Elaine gasped and stumbled into the Lada’s back seat.  Dmitry stared through the rearview, frozen with fear, his eyes wide.

“Go!” Elaine yelled.

Dmitry pressed on the accelerator, burning rubber.

The man ran at the car, smashing his fist into the passenger window, but the Lada grazed him and knocked him to the pavement.

“*Bozhe moi*!” Dmitry yelled.



\* \* \*

“You are hurt!” Dmitry said.

Elaine braced herself, then yanked the stiletto out of her side.   Blood spurted.  For a second she was terrified, afraid she might have been seriously wounded.  But the pick-like instrument had only pierced an inch or so of flesh.  No internal damage had been done.

“I have medic kit,” Dmitry said, fumbling to open the glove compartment.

“Just drive, Dmitry!”

With one hand pressing against her side to stop the bleeding, she opened the first aid kit, pulled up her red-stained blouse, and applied a stick-on bandage to her side.

Dmitry was looking nervously between the road ahead and the rearview.

“Where go now, Janyet?  Where go now?”

Elaine looked out at the heavy traffic.  She changed her mind about trying to go back to the airport.  “Do you know where the American Embassy is?”  

“*Da*.”  He drove faster, tailgating the car in front. 

If they could make it to the embassy, she could call the Treasurer, or the Secretary Treasurer, and explain everything over the phone.  She would turn the data key over to the embassy staff.  They would have to believe her.

She could hardly believe she’d gotten the data key back.  But she’d done it!

Dmitry was looking distractedly into the rearview.  

“What’s the matter?” Elaine said anxiously.  She was afraid to turn around and look.  No way could it be the SUV—it would be impossible to drive with that shredded tire.

“Hummer,” Dmitry said.  

Elaine gathered the courage to look.  The wide, menacing black vehicle was creeping up behind them.  The glass in the Hummer’s windshield was tinted so heavily that it was impossible to see inside.  

“It is Mafia,” Dmitry said, his voice wavering with fear.  

“How do you know?”

“Mafia like Hummer.”

Elaine fought panic—she wasn’t about to let them catch her now, not after all this!

The traffic was thickening as they neared the center of the city.  Ahead, she could see a river of red brake lights that looked like it went on for miles.  The embassy was on the other side of town...they would never make it.

She glanced across the median to the other side of the road.  The traffic back towards the Sheremetyevo Airport was moving along freely.

“Turn around,” she said.

Dmitry hesitated.  “But—”

“Turn around!” she said.  “We’re going back to the airport.”



\* \* \*

The sky was growing lighter, a fine snow falling from gunmetal gray clouds.  Elaine and Dmitry were only a few miles from the Sheremetyevo Airport, but the Hummer was riding their rear bumper.

If she could lose them, somehow, and make it inside the airport, she thought there was a good chance she could flee the country before they could catch her.  She had the fake Irish passport, which nobody knew about, at least not yet.  Sheremetyevo was a very busy airport, with flights leaving every couple of minutes to destinations all over the world.  She had plenty of money—she could buy some clothes in one of the shops and disguise herself, then purchase a ticket on the first flight out.

Dmitry looked petrified, both his hands clutching the steering wheel as if he were holding onto it for dear life.

She looked back at the trailing Hummer again.  “What about losing them on some small roads?” Elaine said.  

Dmitry motioned to the rearview.  “How?  They have Hummer, we have Lada.”

Elaine pointed the gun at the dashboard.  “Open your road atlas and show me where we are.”

Dmitry pulled out the frayed book and turned to the middle.  They were just approaching a town called Burtsevo.  Elaine leaned forward, studying the map.

“What about taking this route?” she said, indicating a small highway that branched off into a forest.  It looked like it continued almost all the way to the airport.  “Can you think of a way to lose them along here?”

“I know this *rejone* well, Janyet—I often fishing in river.”  She saw a thick blue line that snaked through the middle of the green area.  “But there is no way lose them.  I already say you—they have *Hummer* and we have Lada.”

“A Hummer is very wide,” Elaine said, “and your car is very narrow.  Is there some place this car can go that a Hummer *can’t* go?”

She saw the flicker of an idea cross his face.

“What?” Elaine said.

When he didn’t answer, she pushed the gun against his neck again.  “Speak up, Dmitry.”

He swallowed.  “In forest, trees very close together.  Too close together for Hummer.”

“Get off at the next exit.”

**Why This Pick?**

I’m not sure who hurt Miami, but the Heat have now dropped 5 of their last 6 games. Meanwhile, Boston has won 7 of their last 10, and 4 of their last 5 home games. Ultimately, I just think the Celtics are playing much better basketball at home than Miami is on the road. It also doesn’t help that the Heat will be playing this encounter against the Celtics on the tail end of a back-to-back.  Take Boston to cover.

**Chapter 2: The Elevator**

We arrived at one of the three hospitals in Paladin following a low-budget ambulance that looked like it had had its best days many years ago. I am not surprised that no upgrade is needed, as many spells and other solutions for injured citizens sometimes need a quick fix without the human tools commonly used.

Teresa and I watched as the ambulance door opened, and a stretcher approached. With quick interaction from the staff, they got the angel out and rushed her in through the entrance. I was just a little lost in myself. It didn't make sense to me why the Goblin jumped. He is an outsider like me. While the Goblin is half-human and I am human, we don't fit in with the people living in Paladin. While I can walk outside the zone and return to reality in Stockholm, he has nowhere to go except for the outside village. Where there is a place for Creatures or half-breeds to live a calm life together, but because of the aggressive behavior of a goblin and the human side of him, he must have felt lonely and an outcast. Same as me, but maybe a little bit different. For the Goblin to fall into darkness, eat somebody's face, and do bad things means this world has no peace, and that coat guy with the hat managed to escape, which won't make my life easier since I missed him.

The so-called hospital here was just a long, flat building that looked like a health center, but it was wide. Operation-type hospitals usually have several floors, but this was just a one-floor crap. Nothing special, except the bricks were visible, as if it were a run-down building before they turned it into a hospital. Hopefully, the inside doesn't look like the outside. We got out of the car and walked towards the entrance when suddenly someone yelled from behind:

""MOVE!""

When I turned around and saw a guy with a rolling bed, I quickly moved to the side and looked at a red octopus the size of a human with googly eyes, making a hissing sound. Two tentacles that obviously looked like someone had cut them off, and black ooze leaking from the wounds. They quickly rolled through the entry and turned left. We went inside, and an old lady with pink hair, white clothing, and a white hat sat at a desk between the left corridor and the straight one.

""You sure this is a hospital?"" I whispered to Teresa.

She nodded without saying anything and went up to the desk.

""Hello! We are from the Van Polan organization. We are here to see a patient named Greta Ganther."" Teresa said.

The old lady glared at us and said:

""Badge, please.""

Shit! I left my badge on the table at home. Well, my sloppiness is almost legendary. I always get bailed out by Victoria or Teresa anyway.

Teresa got her badge up and showed it to the old lady, who responded:

""Follow the orange line that goes straight.""

We started walking down the orange line a couple of meters before it suddenly turned right. It was a long corridor that, at the moment of turning right, looked like an emergency room. There was some strange smell in the air, though, something I had never smelled before. We kept walking along the orange line, and curtains covered some spaces that looked like temporary rooms, as they do in hospitals in the human world during emergencies. I noticed that the smell came from one of those rooms with curtains.

We reached the end of the corridor, and the orange line now turned to the left. I could see a couple of women standing there, and it looked like they were looking into a room. We kept walking, following the line until we reached them. I tried to squeeze myself through them until I came in front of the window and saw a man sitting on Greta and looking like he was doing CPR on her.

""What happened?"" I asked out in the air.

Of course! A voice that I knew was heard behind me.

""Her heart stopped! He is trying to revive her.""

I knew it was Victoria, and she had come here before me, which is unusual because she doesn't usually follow up this close on assignments. I usually never manage to see her in crowds because of her talent for going unnoticed. I looked back and stared into her blue-colored eyes, and then turned back to the window and saw the doctor who had been doing the CPR suddenly stop and go down from the bed. He checked his clock, which, of course, I knew he was reading the time of Greta's death.

I looked back at Victoria, who shook her head.

""Your eyes are telling me everything, Berk, don't you even dare."" She told me in a severe tone.

I pushed two women out of my way and opened the door, knowing everyone would follow suit and try to stop me. I don't care about that; I did everything possible to protect her because I believed she would survive. I won't let her give up that easily on death. I quickly jumped up on the bed and started to do CPR on Greta, which confused the doctor.

""KEEP THE FUCKING TUBE IN HER MOUTH FOR AIR!"" I screamed at the nurse, who hurried and started to push air through her mouth.

I kept giving her a heart massage and felt several hands trying to drag me away, but I used all my strength and pushed them away for a moment, and kept going with the massage.

""COME ON, GRETA! FIGHT IT!"" I screamed at her.

Suddenly, I felt an immense power grab my shoulder, throwing me to the other side of the room as I lost total control, hitting my back against the wall, and fell on the floor. I had a hard time breathing as I saw the disconnect all equipment attached to Greta and slowly covered a white blanket over her body. I tried to catch my breath from the pain, staring at Victoria, who stared down on me with anger.

""Know your place...Van Polan!” She spoke with a much darker, crisper voice than the lean one she usually has.

I knew in an instant that she was the one who threw me backwards, as the other ones wouldn't dare to create a stir in the hospital. Veronica walked towards me, grabbed my tie, and dragged me out of the room. I knew that both of us were really angry with each other, and this wouldn't end well for anyone.

""LET GO!"" I screamed at her.

I got slammed towards the wall, and she moved quickly towards me as I tried to give her a right fist to the head, but her hand was up with one finger in the air that was gushing out blue fire. Mid-air, the fist had frozen, not even close to her face. She grabbed my blazer and lifted me in the air as I tried to prepare a new punch, but I flew through the corridor, dragged on the floor at high speed, before I hit something. I saw her feet moving towards me, but everything just got blurry until it went pitch-black. I could still hear her high heels hitting the floor as she moved closer, until everything went quiet.

When I opened my eyes, there was an elevator door in front of me; it looked like it had gone through several ghettos in Paladin before arriving here. Chewing gum, graffiti all over it, the upper right corner even looked a little bit melted. I looked around and saw a door to the left with a red-painted window, but a blue graffiti reading 'Go Through This Door If You Want To Die!' on it. Yeah...like I am that stupid to fall for that...or maybe it is really the exit. Looked back, but only a greasy, disgusting wall. There was also a windowed door to the right, and I looked through it to check if it was also a death door. Inside were a lot of school benches and chairs. Is this a classroom? Looked if someone was inside, but it was all empty. Went back to the elevator and pushed the button as the digital sign above counted down from ten until it reached the first floor, and the doors opened with a screech. Eh... someone needs to check the safety measures. The whole situation was weird as hell. I went into the elevator, pressed the number ten button, and the doors slowly closed. The elevator didn't move when suddenly an internal speaker sounded with a female voice:

“Kare wa kachi ga nai!”

Eh! What did it say?

“KARE WA KACHI GA NAI!” It screamed out now.

It kept repeating the same sentence, then went quiet. The doors opened, and I kept pressing the button to close them and move to the tenth floor. The doors didn't move, and the same sentence kept repeating itself. I moved out of the elevator and screamed at it:

""YOU CAN KARE WA KACHI GA NAI...YEAH!"" and the doors slammed shut, and the elevator moved up towards the tenth floor. Damn, this shit —it looks like the elevator is out of reach. There is only the classroom left. I hope that when I enter, a teacher won't show up and force me to study. That would suck...like really bad. I had to open the damn classroom, and I entered, realizing that suddenly there was a small girl, not even looking to be over ten years old. Black hair with red eyes and a freaking maid dress...is she going to teach me how to serve coffee?

""What the fudge is going on here?"" I asked.

She started wiggling her upper body left and right, like it was some side-step disco for kids. I thought I had seen all in my life, like a crocodile wrestler...but this, it takes the prize as the most awkward thing...ever!

I moved to the center of the classroom, but still kept a distance from her. Noticing that the room didn't have any light, I realized it was shining because it came from outside. Moved closer to the window and saw the central city in Stockholm in a sea of fire. The flames were the crap shining up the room. It has to be a dream. I need to exit this dream... it has to be a dream.

When I turned to the girl in the weird outfit, she was smiling now and said:

""At last! It has been such a long time for us. We look forward to swallowing your soul and killing it to take over your body. You are not worthy to inherit the powers of the 100TH Demon Army. So, give us your soul and we will make your meat body stronger. You are too weak to do anything, Berk Van Polan."" And with a high-pitched laugh, a demon's laughter echoed through the room.

I gave her a smirk as she was not the first demon trying to fool me with this talk.

""I thought this was a Cappuccino course on how to serve it perfectly. I suppose that maybe going into the death room would have been a better choice.""

It was silent for a moment. A staring contest was going on between us, and I tried to look serious, but that was so hard. At any moment, something will erupt; I cannot lose to a ten-year-old in my dream...I will not lose.

""Sorry! But my soul is not for sale, Cappuccino maid!""",1,1766163393.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Also curious about the section where it asks about disabilities and medical conditions, I have a rare genetic muscle disorder but there are numerous variants and I have been blessed with the fairly mild side of things (Essentially it’s just harder for me to build and maintain muscle, my only obvious signs are a droopy eyelid as a muscle in it snapped when I was a kid and was replaced with a elastic band essentially, and also the left side of my face is a bit weaker which just results in a crooked smile lol) but other variants of this disorder can cause progressive muscle failure essentially so you never know. I’m in a very active career field as a K9 Handler so I maintain my fitness fairly well overall. 

I’ve answered this truthfully on the petition but curious if this will impact my chances of being initiated?

I don’t know how to feel.,"My wife (31F) of 6 years (11 year relationship) wants to separate from me (30 M). She has not specifically used the word divorce yet though. We began the discussion on Thursday. A similar one conversation to one we had a year prior so it's not like these things are super new. We struggled and we worked through, and I thought we were approaching a better place. I was clearly wrong. So we have a conversation on Thursday. Her main points being she isn't happy and hasn't been for a while. No definition on what a while really means. Probably at least the last 3 months when I have been traveling almost 3 weeks out of every 4 for work. She also claims to have a lot of guilt about our relationship and that she has lost herself. That we got married so young and she doesn't know who she is on her own. She also said she loved me, but wasn't in love with me any more. She didn't feel attraction to me at all. She left for the weekend to stay at a friends and came back before I left for work on Sunday. We had a really good talk on Sunday. We both walked away feeling better had a really long hug. Not reconciled but refreshed and like maybe a new start was possible. At the start she was adamant about not trying. I told her I would love and accept any version of her and losing her was something I’d do anything to prevent, but I would accept her wishes if she could tell me she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to divorce.

This week we have been little to know contact while she thinks about her life and our relationship. It has been devastating for me not knowing how the most important person in my life is making a decision about our future. I have mostly respected her space. I sent her a message on Tuesday asking to talk and she said she wasn’t ready. I said okay and that I loved her. She said I love you too back to me. That's pretty much where we are.

Background

I travel a lot for work. It's a job she really didn't want me to keep doing 3 years ago (I’d been doing for 3 years already and it’s the only job I’ve ever had), but the financial gain is significant, and it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I did talk to her about it and she eventually came on board although now I see that she was just appeasing me. She stopped working after getting out of a toxic workplace 2 years ago. I wanted her to keep working there until she had something else lined up, but she insisted that she could find another job quickly and wanted a month or two to reset. I caved and she has not found work since then.

We both have some anxiety issues and work really runs me down. We don't go out and do much, but we cook together. We started going to Yoga and coffee every now and again, but hindsight shows me we never spent enough quality time together.

We hid our hurt from each other in an effort to make life easier.

We both built up some guilt and resentment about our roles in our relationships.

We hid ourselves from friends and family because of our guilt and stress. Home stopped being a safe place emotionally, not because of abuse, but because of neglect.

I am the only one brining in any income, and spend a lot of time during the weekend cleaning and working on our house. I’m also not just traveling I’m also working 50-60 hours a week on the road. I’m usually just gassed.

She has held onto these feels a lot longer than I. I am an emotional rock when I need to be. Past trauma has hardened me so I kept my head down and assumed the bad part of our relationship were simply her trying to find her way in a career. I encouraged and cheered from the sidelines while finically supporting her and myself. We have a nice little house that needs a decent amount of work which we were working on. We don't want for anything although I hold us back from frivolous spending.

I know she needs time and space, but I can't wrap my head around not working on things. Not trying therapy, couples counseling, reconnecting in meaningful ways. Thursday was the first I heard anything about unhappiness and guilt for an entire year, and now she wants to walk away.

We make contact every night to ensure that we are safe. I say I love you and she says I love you too. She is still thinking and processing. I know especially women need more time to process emotions. Especially ones she's been holding onto for so long and hiding them from me.

She is the most important and precious person in my life. I can't imagine being without her and the regret of neglecting us is killing me. I've already made significant strides. I've started reaching out to therapists. I've made contact with friends and family that are now serving as my support network. I have always had a good sense of self, but feel it even more. I am my own person and I will be the person she fell in love with again. I just hope it isn't too late.

Is there any hope of reconciliation here?

Is there anything I can do to help her in this situation?

How can someone claim to love you and not want to work towards at least closure and understanding?

How can I work on healing myself outside of her? Because I need to focus on fixing myself before I think I can be with her or anyone again

I’m also not sure how to feel. She doesn’t help enough. I do so much around the house in addition to being the only one working. She spends a ton of time on her phone and watches a ridiculous amount of TV. Maybe this isn’t really what I want but the sudden shock of all this (I know I should have seen it coming) has put me into crisis mode.

I think I’ve processed well enough though. I think my answer is “I love you very much and would do anything to fix us and get us back on track, but respect your decision to leave. I won’t fight or argue with you.”",3,1766162865.0,Marriage,9,1.0,False

I've become really familiar with the market, law firms, agencies, etc in my home state during law school, and it's intimidating to start at ground zero in the new state. I still waffle between public interest and just going to work at a firm. Student loan debt is an issue so lately I've been leaning towards firm for that and to get experience. I worked at a firm during 2L summer and liked it but they don't have an office where I'm going. 

I've already done a bit of networking by reaching out to lawyers at firms in the new state last year; had a few zoom calls; they said to stay in touch etc. I'd like to reach out to them but I'm anxious because what do I say besides hi I got a clerkship?

How should I approach networking now that I will be seeking a job to begin 2027 after a competitive clerkship? Is it cringe to tell people you're moving there for a clerkship and wanting to get feelers for opportunities in the area as well as just get to know the local bar? I am also curious if firms to tend to deliberately recruit from the state supreme courts or whether it is going to take a lot of initiative and traditional networking on my end. 

I know I'm kinda early, and I should just wait to start working with the judge and see what he has to say, but I'm excited to move there and get a feel for the market. I might like to do a few coffee chats while studying for the bar etc.

1pqpw88,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pqpw88/from_aspiring_to_broken_the_story_of_my_life/,From aspiring to broken: The story of my life.,"So in 2015, my adult live basically started. I was 18 and moved out from my parent's place to study. I still had a lot of insecurities and was kind of naive, but I also was eager to explore what life had to offer. I was resourceful, hopeful and ambitious. At first, I was spending the little money I had mostly on partying, just going with the flow. I was quite extroverted and bold at the time. Then I somehow got into founding a startup with two friends, in parallel to studying. Doing this turned out to be intriguing, and we actually had some success. I was always someone who is full of big ideas and curious about basically anything, so this felt awesome.

In 2016, I got a girlfriend and also got to know a guy, CEO of another small company and a client of mine. We really had a vibe and were inspiring each other, talking for hours. One of my co-founders got sick, and me and the remaining one later had a dispute over how to invest or something. I told my co-founder I'd quit, he can run the company the way he wants. Instead I went all in together with the other guy, working on the plans we had. It was exciting, a fruitful cooperation and I did insane work, working insane hours. Mind you, mostly for no pay, just trying to finish the product and earn eventually. I didn't even do all this for the money, my main motivation at the time was just to see what was possible for the sake of curiosity. I was grinding like crazy for like a year.

My relationship turned bad, due to both unrelated problems my girlfriend had, and me being overworked. My relationship with her parents, at whose place I had to be almost every weekend to see my girlfriend without wanting be be there, soured. I was struggling to keep it all together. My gf broke up with me in spring of 2017. I was devastated, but I continued working. Giving up seemed insane, I had already invested soooo much time and energy, and everything seemed so close. But I was struggling with the breakup, the ever-increasing pressure of time, and ever-growing requirements. At this point, all other areas of my life besides work were reduced to a minimum. One night, my business partner called me and blamed me for like an hour for not keeping the deadlines, and for designing the product in a way he didn't understand or like. There were calls like this before, but this time, I was just frozen for its entire duration. I physically couldn't hang up or say anything. After the call ended, I was still numb, kind of unable to do anything meaningful. It was like midnight and I was just standing there, staring into nothing for like an hour or so. I went out to get drunk alone the next days because I just couldn't bear being concious.

Our professional relationship normalized after this, we postponed deadlines, but pressure only reduced slightly. I had lost touch with the other areas of my former life, friends, and most imporantly, with my feelings. Always forcing myself to push through it and finish it - then I'd rest, I told myself. In the summer of 2018, there was one day were I had an in-person meeting, getting to know some important people. On this day, suddenly I just knew: This is over. I have exceeded any limit of what I can take. I only felt empty and hollow, no real pain. I had reached the point of no turning back of a severe burnout. While casually drinking a coffee in a street cafe later the same day with my business partner, I told him something feels off and I somehow think that I'll quit. I proceeded to do this, giving up on all my ambitions. I was literally unable to work even if I tried, but I didn't even care about anything anymore. So the whole project was cancelled and I walked out of this thing having done mostly unpaid work that probably was never going to be used, or recognized.

Whatever. I was dead inside and literally unable to even comprehend the scale of this whole tragedy, mentally or emotionally. All the time I wasted for nothing. The huge damage to my mental health. I spent the next 3 years really depressed, finishing my studies. I took a long time to reach out for professional help, since I lacked the energy, but I eventually did. Unfortunately, my therapist ended up just ghosting me (like wtf, you can't do that to people). I did not have the willpower to find another one after this. Time went by, some days felt ok, others I was literally unable to shower, cook, or eat, rotting in bed. Some nights I would wander around the city for hours, just listening to music, driven by a kind of longing I did not understand. Just reflecting on the past and trying to feel something other than emptiness.

Then in 2021, I finally found out how to be lighthearted and happy again. My values had definitely shifted. I priorized going with the flow and making authentic experiences, keeping worries at a distance. It was obvious to me I had been exploited, and had been self-exploiting. I was over it enough to get on with life. I was stable. 2021 to 2023 were generally good years. I worked and later did a Master's degree during this time. In fall of 2023, I got into a relationship in which I saw a lot of potential, like I had a feeling she may be the one. Insane connection on an intellectual level. But an initially awesome relationship changed into me supporting her more and more, both emotionally and through hands-on help for managing her affairs. It turned out she was suffering from untreated ADHD and severe outbursts of anger, as well as depression. This comes in part from emotional trauma she had in her past life. She was in therapy throughout the entire relationship. Still, I loved her a lot. She moved into my place, initially it was supposed to be temporary.

She started to regularly have severe outbursts of rage including violence against objects, self-harm, and/or panic attack-like states. They were almost always caused by small things that were in most cases not related to me, just more or less normal, unpleasant things that would happen to her, or us/her having to change plans. I was trying intensely to work on solutions with her, reflecting and brainstorming solutions in countless constructive conversations, doing all I could to make her feel loved and safe. I noticed this becoming more and more asymmetric, and I tried to balance it out, but the incidents kept happening and she kept becoming more dependent on me. I slid into a role where I was carrying her emotional baggage, supporting her all the time, providing for us financially (she couldn't work) and trying to start a career in a demanding field (full-time, 100% remote). All this while being - once again - forced to suppress my own feelings and needs day by day in order to function, to keep it all together. When she had a crisis, I had to take over control of the situation and manage it, because she becomes literally unable to act. If I were to not handle it, her behavior would escalate, which is traumatic to me, and in addition, I would be blamed for not helping. I need to add that I'm generally a very calm person who values/needs harmony.

So over a course of 2 years, I basically burned out once again while supporting her and enduring her rage, and working a full time job. I was starting to struggle at work, eventually I lost my job in August 2025. Soon after, I - once again - finally couldn't take it anymore in a literal, physical sense, so I broke up with her using the last bit of energy I could scrape together. Now I'm alone again, burned out, and broke. She owes me $2500. The job market is trash right now. I realized my profession will not make me happy long-term, in the sense that I don't see a purpose in it, and also, I don't want to work remotely anymore because I really need like-minded people (co-workers) who I see in real life frequently. I also need friends living nearby. My friends don't live nearby unfortunately. I value them but I can't burden them with the full scale of my problems, they can only provide superficial help. I need a community. I live in a small town with few young people, and I want to move.

I have been looking for a job and a general perspective ever since August, all alone every day in my bed, on my laptop, researching opportunities and reaching out to companies. Money will run out in January. Today, I feel so depressed that I'm literally paralyzed, I cannot do anything productive. I can't think of anything that would help me relax. I cannot enjoy anything. I tried to get professional psychological help multiple times in the last months, but no one has capacities. I tried countless things to help mental health on my own, over the years. It seems like I can't get in touch with my feelings, it's all bottled up. I can't even cry, just paralyzed. How can I get out of this? I'm so done.

While I understand that is a given point, because the more coffee in the roaster, the more heat application and the longer it takes to cook, i find it so interesting that there is no set blueprint on roasting. 

There are so many people that explain that two minute development.Time post first crack is way too much time to spend for a light roast yet.It also depends on the type of machine that you are using and also the batch size. I want to know what everyone's take.Is on development time duration between the three phases of coffee development. You see Rob Hoos and Scott Rao explaining that a five second longer time in my yard.Yields a different flavor result.And likewise, a ten second longer duration in the development phase yields a different flavor result. 

The problem I have though, is that these points have really no reference to anybody.As everyone's roaster is completely different, everybody profile is different.Everybody calls first crack at different times everybody has their own specific time spent in development to yield certain flavors. 

A roaster based out of the UK by the name of James Wilkins told me this
 
Iunderstand your frustration but the answer is
that there's no real blueprint. You have to first
understand your machines capabilities and then
apply that to each cultivar and processing
method and measure it against your desired
roast outcome.
If it's any consolation, I've roasted around 60,000
batches in my career and still confidentially don't
know what I'm doing!
3w ago
However, in your case specially I would go back
to basics. Start with a basic coffee (washed
central) and roast it to a standard set of profiles:
9,10,11 and 12 minutes. Keep development
times equal, try and hit the same end temp but
alter time to FC to get the designed roast time.
Do this on and 80% batch size. Cup them and
figure which tastes best. Then begin refining that
basic profile.

What I find so interesting is that people are able to create such amazing profiles and amazing tasting coffee. When there truly is no set blueprint, they figure it out on their roaster.
And then replicate that same profile. This whole discussion is for specialty coffee, not home roasting.

Like everyone in this subreddit, I have a bit of a coffee obsession. And I've been addicted since I was 10 years old, if I'm being honest. I've been stuck in the espresso rabbit hole for so long, and dreaming of owning my first machine. And because I'm basic, I really want to own a La Marzocco Linea Micra (lol). However, like I mentioned, this would be my very first machine ever. Is it too ambitious to get my endgame machine out-the-get-go? Should I buy a more ""realistic"" machine and then get the micra down the line?",9,1766162275.0,espresso,47,0.84,False

Tapos eto pa sabi niya may crush din siya sakin pero 40% lang daw hahaha tapos yung 60% daw is nalilibugan siya sakin??? like wtf bro bwahahha sinabi niya talaga yan! 

And eto plot twist na nakakainis, may nangyari samin! nakakainis kasi bat naman ako nagpadala agad sa tukso?? hays. tapos ayun naka ilang coffee date naman kami since pareho kami nag aaral tapos sinabi niya sakin na kung pwede daw wag namin madaliin ang feelings namin kasi mas maganda raw if ma fall kami naturally and mag stay lang muna kami sa kung ano kami dati before magkaaminan. I said NO hahaha. Sabi ko ayoko muna siya makita since baka ako yung maging lugi kasi everytime na nakakausap and nakakasama ko siya mas lalo ako nahuhulog kasi siya nakikita ko na parang di pa talaga siya interested to have someone which is naiintindihan ko.

Steve pulled his car over at the overlook and looked at what lay before him. In the valley below was a small quaint town and on the other side was another mountain. He knew the mountain on the other side of the valley well. Although He couldn't see it, he could point out exactly where his family's farm was. He had grown up on that mountain and knew all the streams that cut their paths on it. He and his brother had run that mountain and knew all the areas you didn't dare step foot into. The mountain folks had their own law. If you respect it, you would get along great. If not you suffered the consequences, and they could be fatal. 
      
Steve's trip started several months ago, when he had returned for his mother's funeral. He realized that his Dad was not able to care for the farm like he used to. Steve realized that he needed to be closer and help out more. He started putting out feelers to tech companies in North Carolina. That way he would be able to make it back to the farm in Eastern Tennessee and visit his Dad on the weekends to help him out. 
     
Steve's answer came a few months ago when his boss approached him. The company was being sold to a larger company and he was being offered a generous separation package, a golden handshake. With that and his investments, Steve was sitting in a very good position. He had bought his house when he started with the company over twenty years ago which was now paid off, so with it all he could afford to retire. At least take some time off for a while. 

He had missed so many opportunities to spend time with his parents, and now it was too late for his Mom so he wanted to make sure he didn't make the same mistake with his Dad. 
     
Steve was working pioneering the video conferencing technology so was paid very well but had a very demanding schedule. It was so demanding that it was difficult to have any relationship. He dated casually, but was not able to develop anything beyond that. In the beginning, transferring the data required for a video conference call overwhelmed the phone lines so the conference call had to be made in the middle of the night when the traffic on the lines was lowest and having the least interference. So Steve worked all hours of the day and night. The company had a cafeteria so he ate most of his meals there. His expenses were low so he had invested most of what he made. 
     
He put his house on the market as soon as he knew he was leaving. It was a desirable location and had practically no wear and tear. He knew that prices for homes had gone up, he just didn't realize how much. It sold immediately. Actually there was a bidding war on it. Steve got a lot more for it than he was expecting. Steve decided to drive back home since he had always wanted to see the country. 
He had only seen it from 30,000 feet as he was flying over it. He left with no schedule because he wanted to see as much as he could on the way. He only told his Dad he was going to be coming back. Normally he would give a detailed time so the word would get around to all the mountain that he was coming in so he wouldn't be shot. 
     
The people on the mountain had a shoot first, ask questions later policy. Many of the farmers made moonshine to make ends meet and the revenuers, as the mountain people called any law enforcement who would try to shut down the stills, were in a war to stop them. Revenuers were despised on the mountain. If the still making moonshine was shut down, an entire family could starve during the winter. It was a war for survival. If someone was suspected of being a revenuer, there was a good chance they wouldn't make it off the mountain.
      
When Steve was close, the first thing he did was stop at the car dealership in Kingsport and traded his car in on an older pickup. At least he would have a chance of not getting shot like this. He would need a pickup around the farm anyway. He stopped by the store to pick up some groceries then headed up the mountain toward his home. His father welcomed him warmly and they sat and chatted all evening. 
     
Steve was reminded that chores started early. His Dad had never allowed anyone to lay around and sleep in at his house. All the animals had to be let out to graze and get water. The chickens had to be fed and the eggs gathered. There was always something that needed to be done. Steve was able to see a lot of things that were being neglected. His Dad used to keep the place in pristine condition. Many would say that it was the nicest place on the mountain. Weeds were sprouting where there used to never be any. The barn was needing to be painted and the garden had been neglected. He had his work cut out for him, and he got to it.
     
Steve took his father to church that Sunday. Everyone now knew he was back on the mountain. They were polite but did not welcome him with open arms by any means. He was considered an outsider. He had left for college and had been gone for about thirty years. He knew it would take time for them to warm up to him. These were people who if you stopped them to ask about someone and they didn't know you, the answer was “I never heard of them” even though they were best friends and they had just left the person's house.
     
Steve started to work on the farm. It was ninety acres that had been in the family for generations. All that was left of the original cabin was the stone chimney. It looked like it would still be standing in another hundred years. Sometimes when he was working in the area by the chimney he would start a fire in it to warm up. It still worked perfectly. Slowly the place started to look more like it used to. His Dad would help but would tire easily. He was still in good shape considering he was well into his seventies. 

Steve cleaned out the garden and planted a full garden like his mother would. He didn't realize it was so much work. When the plants sprouted, Steve would haul water up from the spring and give each plant a drink. But then the garden produced an abundance. Much more than he and his Dad would use. He took a box of produce up to the old widow up the road. She had been the old widow since he was just a kid. She had never gotten married again and was known as being somewhat mean. Many questioned if any man would dare marry her. 

When he dropped off the produce, she was going on about how something got into her chicken coop and killed all her chickens. Steve took a look at the coop and understood why. It was literally falling apart. He gave her the things from the garden and told her he would stop by later.
     
Steve went to town and bought all the materials that he needed. He then returned and built the old widow a new chicken coop. He then went down to another neighbor, Betty, who had a lot of chickens. Her husband had been a big moonshiner. He had been delivering a large shipment when he was ambushed and killed. He left Betty well off financially. He was operating on a large scale and was making huge profits. He had bought farms surrounding his farm and now had some choice land. It was more than Betty could take care of so she rented out much of the land. That gave her the means to survive. 
     
When Steve pulled in and asked to buy some chickens, she looked at him suspiciously. She asked him why he wanted chickens, they already had plenty. When Steve  told her he was getting them for the old widow, her attitude changed. She even helped him catch them and made sure that a rooster was included. She insisted on going with him to deliver them. It had been a while since she visited the old widow and wanted to catch up. Steve showed Betty the new coop then worked at getting the chickens settled in their new home and made sure they had food and water while the ladies chatted.
     
When Steve drove Betty home, she asked him if he wanted a glass of iced tea. Steve knew this was more than an offer of a cold drink. It was an offer to get to know each other better. They sat on her porch and chatted until it started to get dark. It turned out that Betty was a few years younger than he was. She had married her husband right after she finished school. She never agreed to his business but he had big plans. He always promised to quit but never quite got around to it. Now she was content working with her animals.
     
Steve told her about his life. How both of his parents always pushed education. His older brother Oscar had always rebelled against it. As soon as he turned eighteen he left for a construction job and nobody heard from him again. 

Steve then told her how he had gotten an engineering degree and worked with that in California until he was given a generous seperation bonus recently and that he enjoyed being back on the mountain. He asked her if she would like to come to dinner with him and his Dad. She agreed so they set a date and time.
     
Steve wanted to prepare a Mexican meal but couldn't find the items he wanted at the local store so he got on the Internet. The only Internet connection was a local dial up service. It would drop his connection at the most inconvenient times. He found a place in Texas that would ship him everything he needed. Then as he was checking out, the connection dropped again and he had to reconnect and start all over. He finally was able to place his order and get his confirmation. 
     
When Steve first got there, he was online a lot, checking emails, picking up the latest news, seeing what was new. Now that he had been there a bit he found he was online less and less. His schedule started becoming tuned to nature. The day consisted of letting the animals out in the morning, feeding, milking, and making sure all the animals were safe and secure in the evenings. Spring was a time of activity, getting the garden planted, taking care of what got damaged over the winter, and the cows calving. Summer was putting up the hay for winter feeding, making sure there was water available for everything, and maintenance. Fall was harvesting time and preparing for winter, gathering firewood, and making sure everything was set up for winter. Then winter was a time to rest.
     
When Steve and Betty had their dinner, it seemed that the entire mountain knew before the dinner was over. The next day a couple of older men stopped by the house. After exchanging pleasantries they got to the point, what were his intentions for Betty? Steve assured them that he had honorable intentions. Right now he was focused on caring for his Dad. He wasn't even intending to court her yet, but if he did it would be honorable. They nodded and said to make sure that it stayed that way. If he hurt her, there would be a price to pay. Steve fully understood what was meant. He wasn't offended at all, they were just looking out for someone who was their own like they would a daughter or sister. They shared a sip of moonshine from a quart jar and the men left. Steve knew this meant all was good. If they weren't satisfied with his response, they would never share a drink with him.
    
The mountain had an unspoken code of conduct, if you act like a wild animal, you will be treated like a wild animal. There were consequences for offenses. The police were never seen on the mountain and they were never  called. There was a council that was made up of the head of each clan, or family group on the mountain. It worked like a court. Whenever there was a serious crime the council was called. They would hear the facts and determine the punishment. It would range from being banished from the mountain to death depending on the circumstances. The offended clan would be responsible for carrying out the punishment. 
    
If a single girl was seduced, the man would have the opportunity to marry the girl. If not, he was to make it right with the family and probably be banished from the mountain. If someone that had been banished from the mountain returned, they would never make it off the mountain. 

If a married woman was seduced, the man would be banished or killed if he did it more than once. If a man raped a woman he was tied up in the woods and his offending member would be cut off, then he would be left there tied up. Nobody could remember the last time there was a rape. 

If someone was killed, it was determined if it was fair. If not the person responsible would be killed. It really made for a peaceful existence for everyone on the mountain. It was a pleasant place to live as long as you lived according to the code.
    
Steve's Dad still called the shots at the farm. They bred the cows in the fall so they would keep producing milk. The cows had the calves in the spring and once the calves were old enough they would either be sold off or one would be kept to replace one of the older milk cows that was being aged out. Once a cow aged out, she would live out the rest of her days in the pasture. When one of the retired cows died at a ripe old age, Steve needed to bury her. He found a good deal on a backhoe, so bought it and had it delivered to the farm. It took him hours to figure out the controls, then went out to the pasture and buried the cow under the huge old oak tree where the old cow always laid in the heat of summer. That evening as Steve and his Dad sat out on the front porch, his Dad commented on how that had been his favorite cow.                         
   
As they sat enjoying the cool evening breeze, Steve asked his Dad about something that he always wondered about. He asked if his Dad remembered when the new school house was built when Steve was a kid. His father had a big smile on his face. 
     
His Dad replied “Oh yes the old school house was a disaster. An old log building that only had two rooms for the elementary grades and a shed out back for the high school. No wonder they had so few kids to even start high school. That school building was nearly a hundred years old.”
     
Steve related how he remembered that they had been using dynamite to blast tree stumps about the time the old school house was blown up, and how the day after it happened several sticks of dynamite were missing. 
     
His Dad's smile got even bigger. “Well, I'd been on the school board asking for a new school for years. That old school house was a disgrace. It was an oven in the summer and a freezer in the winter. Every year it was the same old story. We can't afford it, there is a perfectly good building being used already. I finally had it with them.” He then said with a twinkle in his eyes Steve hadn't seen in a long time “So I waited until summer vacation, checked and made sure everything was out and took care of it. You should have seen it when it went up.”
      
Steve acknowledged it was a lot easier to learn in the new school. He never asked about it before because he didn't want his Dad to get in trouble, but it did get the new school built. You don't want to mess with a mountain man, he will burn your house down, or blow it up.
    
With his Dad getting weaker, Steve turned to a family that lived close by. They had five kids with another on the way. He talked to the father and told him if he would let the two older boys work at the farm for the summer, he would pay the boys a wage and he would give them the three calves born that spring. The father jumped at the offer. Times had been rough for them and with the baby on the way, he wasn't sure how they were going to make it. 
     
Steve had them help him with the garden and showed them how he cared for it. Steve purposely bought more seed than he needed and gave the extra to the boys. The boys took the seeds and planted their own garden at home. He had the boys help him with milking the cows and sent them home with milk every day. He told them he and his Dad weren't drinking that much milk anymore and he was tired of throwing out spoiled milk. 
    
The oldest boy Jimmy was smart when it came to anything mechanical. What took Steve hours to figure out with the backhoe, Jimmy had down in minutes. Jimmy was already a better operator than he would ever be. If anything broke, Jimmy would have it figured out in no time. Steve's old pick up started to break down a lot. Jimmy would pop the hood and have it purring before Steve could find the manual to see what it could be. 
     
Steve was worried about the old pickup breaking down when he was out somewhere and not being able to get home to his Dad. So he bought a new truck and left the old one for Jimmy to use around the farm. Jimmy always took care of that pickup. When the summer ended, Steve had the boys help him load up the calves onto the old pickup. 

Steve gave Jimmy the keys and asked if he could get the calves home safely. Jimmy had a shocked look on his face and stuttered “I think so.” Those calves had the smoothest ride any cow had ever had. Steve told him to use the truck to travel back and forth from his home to the farm. Winter was coming and he could get sick walking back and forth. It became Jimmy's pickup. Steve never saw that truck dirty again, which was quite a feat with only dirt roads in the area.
     
When winter snow came, Steve would use the backhoe to make sure the road was clear up to the old widows house and cleared her driveway. He then cleared the road to Jimmy's house and cleared their drive. He then went down to Betty's and cleared her driveway. Betty came out to thank him and asked him to come in for a cup of coffee to warm up. He gladly accepted. They talked for a bit then said he was sorry but he needed to get back to check on his Dad. He was starting to fail and he wasn't sure how much longer he would last.
     
That spring Steve helped his Dad out to the front porch and wrapped  a blanket around him. His Dad loved sitting there, looking out over the pasture with the barn off down by the road. The place was back to its former glory. Steve went in to get a mug of hot tea for his Dad. When he returned a few moments later with the tea, he realized that his Dad had died there in his favorite spot with a satisfied smile on his face.
    
At the funeral it was spoken of the impact his Dad had on the mountain and the surrounding area, his belief in and drive he had for educating the kids of the mountain. He was remembered for his push to get the new school built. Many of the people there remembered going to the old school and what a pain it had been. It was amazing the difference in the results the new school brought. Kids started attending and graduating high school. The attendance went way up. And there was a lot less sickness with the young children. 
    
After the funeral, Steve had a stream of visitors all bringing food for him. It was at this point that Steve realized that he had been accepted on the mountain. He truly had returned home. There was no way he could eat all this food. He gave some to Jimmy's family, then made up a few meals and took them to the old widow. On his way home he noticed an old farmer up on his roof patching the patches that made up his roof. 
      
When he got home he called up a roofer that lived on the mountain and told the roofer that he would pay him to put a new metal roof on the old farmers house. Just tell the farmer that you had someone that hired you and paid in advance but cancelled after the materials arrived. If he doesn't use them, they will be ruined. Steve then told the roofer just don't say anything about him being involved and paying. 
     
Steve went by Betty's place and apologized for ignoring her. He had just been so focused on caring for his Dad. Betty told him that she would not have any respect for him if he hadn't taken care of his Dad like he did. It spoke volumes about his character. It was then official, they were courting.

I thought it was worth to get since Houston doesn’t necessarily get or have city branded merch (correct me if im wrong). Did anyone else go or is going to the grand opening? Would love to know! :) ",23,1766162135.0,lululemon,7,1.0,False
1pqpmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/singleph/comments/1pqpmkl/23f4m_genuine_connection/,23[F4M] Genuine Connection,"Heyyyy! 👋

I’m posting here again because I believe the ✨right✨ connection is worth waiting (and trying) for. If you’re someone who values effort, honesty, and genuine conversations—welcome. 😊

About Me (the fun + real parts)

• 4’11” on paper, magically 5’2” outside. Heels are a lifestyle, not a choice.

• NBSB (Never Been in a Relationship)— and yes, I’m proud of it. I believe in intentional beginnings.

• Soft, slightly chubby cutie— meds added a little weight, but confidence stayed. If you only like super slim girls, we might not be a match (photos are on my profile for reference).

• Night-shift, WFH girly— U.S. hours, Philippines-based. I still reply in the mornings because apparently my brain refuses to sleep long.

• Financially independent — I can pay for myself, always. I just don’t want to date someone who expects me to pay for ✨everything✨. I’m young, not a sugar mommy. 😭

• Cafe hopper & foodie at heart — whether solo or with friends, I love discovering new coffee spots and restaurants.

• Nature lover & travel enthusiast— road trips, views, quiet moments, and creating memories (especially with family).

• Not a gamer — tried once, got called a noob, retired peacefully. 😂

• High-energy person— I bring enthusiasm, curiosity, and a lot of personality. If that overwhelms you, I get it… but consider this your disclaimer.

• Fast replier & certified yapper— I enjoy conversations. If you hate excited messages or long chats, you may want to keep scrolling.

• Road-trip lover— usually with my dad (yes, daddy’s girl energy). I don’t drive yet, so bonus points if you do. 😅

• Has a curfew — strict parents. But once trust is built, that curfew mysteriously disappears. 😌

---
🌱 Green Flags I Appreciate 🌱

✔ Loves coffee and café hopping

✔ Big foodie — open to trying new cuisines

✔ Nature lover & travel enthusiast

✔ Enjoys road trips

✔ Respects boundaries and pacing

---
❌ My “Red Flags” (just being honest 🚩)

• Vertigo / motion sickness

• Afraid of swimming in the beach

• Parent-imposed curfew (late-night spontaneity can be tricky)

• Prefer structured or safe adventures over extreme activities (no skydiving or deep-sea diving 😅)

• Prefer getting to know someone through chat first before meeting in person

---
 Someone Who Might Be My Type (hopefully you exist 🥺)

• 25–29 years old — I naturally prefer someone a bit older

• Taller than me (around 5’9” and up) — I’m already small, let’s give future kids a fighting chance 😂

• Has a stable job or income — I’ve experienced dating someone unemployed who expected me to pay on the first date. Never again. I’m okay with 50/50; I just want balance.

• Consistent & considerate — if you lose interest, please communicate. No ghosting.

• Can make time — effort matters more than words

• Good listener and a talker — conversations should go both ways. Nakakapagod if one person does all the emotional lifting 😂

• Comfortable chatting first — I like building rapport online so meeting feels natural, not awkward

---

If you made it this far, thank you 🫶
If you decide to message me, ✨please introduce yourself properly✨—I usually don’t reply to messages with no effort or no context.

Hoping to connect with someone intentional, kind, and genuine. 🤍✨",1,1766162130.0,singleph,0,1.0,False
1pqplub,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1pqplub/echos_of_the_void_guild_day_2_0700/,Echos of the Void Guild day 2 -0700,"Titus awoke at exactly 0700, heart pounding in sudden terror—“Where am I—before memory flooded back: the station, . He swung his legs off the bunk, feet hitting cold deck plating, and headed straight for the tiny shower. Hot water chased away the disorientation; he brushed his teeth, pulled on a fresh jumpsuit, and checked the time—0720. Data pad in hand, he stepped into the corridor where crew bustled past, the rich scent of coffee mingling with breakfast wraps.

A tall woman in the blue-and-gray guild pilot uniform approached—just under two meters, shiny coal-black hair, high cheekbones, slim yet curvaceous build. She eyed him curiously. “Hi, rookie. Who are you with?”

Titus replied, offering a polite nod. “I’m Titus Staples—just arrived yesterday.”

Her brows lifted. “Listen to everything the instructor says.”

Titus nodded. “Would love to talk more, but I need coffee and food—fast.”

She smiled, extending a hand. “Name’s Kelly Raven. Welcome to the edge of nowhere.”

He shook it firmly. “Titus. See you around, Kelly.”

They parted. After a few steps, she called, “Hey, Titus! What class?”

He shouted back without turning, No class I'm with Instructor Russell . He said one-on-one. Gotta go!”

In the mess hall, Titus loaded his tray: two egg and meat wraps oozing white cheese, two rare oranges, and a large black coffee. He scanned his chit then scanned the room when a voice cut through: “Titus Staples!”

Administrator Hale and Edward Russell waved him over from a corner table. “Good morning, sirs,” Titus said, setting his tray down.

“Sit,” Edward ordered.

Hale added, “We were discussing today’s training. Slight change.”

Titus looked wary. “Sir? What are the new plans?”

Edward leaned forward. “Special run. Hale needs a replacement  transmission delivered to a mining outpost in Sector Seven’s heavy field. You and me. Eat fast—grab extra wraps. Long day ahead. Coffee’s on the transport. Wheels up 0900, waiting on final loadout.”

Hale, mind still flickering to yesterday’s blue-haired visitor, opted for safer ground. “Did you let your family know you arrived safely?”

“Yes, sir. Quick comm call—cost ninety credits a minute. Also sent a letter via hauler.” Titus paused. “My father died when I was very young. Mum raised me alone.”

Hale nodded solemnly. Edward just grunted, pushing an extra wrap onto Titus’s tray.

Titus ate quickly, the wraps savory and filling, the oranges a sharp burst of citrus he hadn’t tasted fresh in months. Thinking to himself where were they grown . Getting up He obeyed Edward’s gesture and grabbed three more wraps, wrapping them in napkins for later. Coffee refilled, he felt the caffeine hit his bloodstream like a gentle burn.

At 0830, Edward’s data pad buzzed. He glanced at it, face impassive. “Load’s ready for inspection. Let’s move.”

They left the mess hall, Hale staying behind to finish reports. The walk to the shuttle bay took ten minutes—down two decks via a rattling lift, along a main arterial corridor humming with cargo drones and crew. Edward walked briskly, boots ringing, and began firing questions without preamble.

“Specs on the mining transport—thrust-to-mass ratio at full load?”

Titus recited from memory, voice steady. “One-point-eight gees sustained, two-point-four on emergency burn.”

“Fuel type and burn time to Sector Seven at cruise?”

“Fusion torch, deuterium-helium-three mix. Four hours to midpoint flip, total transit seven hours forty including deceleration.”

Edward grunted approval. “Viewports—material and pressure tolerance?”

“Triple-layer borosilicate composite, rated to fifteen atmospheres external differential. Reinforced against micrometeoroids up to five millimeters at thirty klicks relative.”

“Good. Emergency airlock cycle time?”

“Forty-two seconds full depressurize-repressurize.”

They reached the bay doors, which irised open to reveal the cavernous space. The shuttle hangar was a vast, echoing chamber carved into the heart of the converted hauler—hundreds of meters long, ribbed with massive support beams and glowing holographic markers guiding traffic. Overhead gantries swung with magnetic cranes, while force-field shimmered at the open outer doors, holding in atmosphere against the void. Sparks flew from welders on distant scaffolds, and the air thrummed with the whine of loaders and the sharp tang of coolant and ozone. Multiple vessels dotted the deck: sleek racers in auxiliary berths, bulky haulers under repair, and in the center, their mining shuttle—a blunt, rectangular slab of scarred alloy, forty meters long, single massive fusion nozzle at the stern glowing faintly on standby. Cargo pallets were being locked into the rear hold by automated arms, supervised by ground crew in heavy exosuits.

Edward led Titus along the hull, eyes scanning seams, thruster bells, sensor clusters. He pointed to a magnetic clamp array. “Purpose?”

“Cargo securement in zero-g, also emergency grappling for derelict recovery.”

“Correct. Check the forward port viewport seal—look for microfractures.”

Titus pressed close, running a gloved finger along the frame, peering through the thick glass. “Clean, sir. No stress lines.”

They moved aft, Edward quizzing relentlessly: power distribution redundancy, life-support scrubber capacity, radiation shielding thickness in the crew compartment. Titus answered each without hesitation, the overnight study paying off. Edward’s nods grew marginally less curt. Edward finally asking kid how you know all these specs . Titus smiling with Sir I was given this same model when I was 12 for my birthday . 

I learned all the specs from the data sheet and building of the model . Edward looking at Titus don't get smart with me kid . And a smile formed on his face . 

Near the open cargo ramp, Cathy Adams—the slim mechanic under two meters tall, blonde hair tied into a practical braided ponytail that swung as she moved, faint grease streaks on her cheeks—wiped her hands on a rag and spotted them. Her eyes lingered on Titus, appraising openly as he bent to inspect a tie-down bolt.

  Edward stepped away to confer with another instructor about fuel purity logs, leaving Titus momentarily alone.

Cathy sauntered over, tool belt clanking. “Fresh face. You’re the rookie Russell snagged for solo training?”

Titus straightened, offering a polite smile and extending his hand. “Yes, ma’am. Titus Staples. Nice to meet you.”

She shook it firmly, grin widening. “Cute one, too. What’s your girlfriend think of you being way out here in the black?”

Titus felt heat rise in his cheeks. “No girlfriend, ma’am.”

“Uh-huh.” Cathy winked. “Lucky void, then.” She leaned against a crate, voice dropping playfully. “Name’s Cathy Adams. I keep these bricks flying. You break anything on my bird, I’ll break you.”

Before Titus could respond, Edward returned, conversation ended. “Loadout’s solid. Final manifest signed. Mount up.”

They boarded via the side airlock, Titus stowing the extra wraps in a galley locker while Edward ran pre-flight from the cockpit. The shuttle’s interior was utilitarian—twelve viewports offering panoramic views, crash couches for twenty, a small galley, and comms station. The secure transmission module—a black, tamper-proof cylinder—was already locked in the forward rack.

Engines spooled up with a deep thrum. Docking clamps released with metallic clangs. Edward eased the throttle forward, the rectangular beast lifting smoothly on maneuvering thrusters before the main torch ignited in a controlled blue-white flare.

As they cleared the bay doors, the station fell away behind them, asteroids beginning their slow dance across the forward viewports. Sector Seven lay ahead—dense, hazardous, unforgiving.

Edward glanced sideways. “Seven hours out, seven back. You’ll take second shift on helm after midpoint flip. Impress me, kid.”

Titus strapped in tighter, the acceleration pressing him gently into the couch. “Yes, sir.”

Outside, the void swallowed them, stars sharpening into pinpricks as the torch burned steady. The real training had begun—not in a simulator, but in the black itself, where mistakes cost more than grades.

Back on station, Cathy watched the shuttle vanish into the belt, shaking her head with a grin. Later, in the crew lounge, she cornered Kelly Raven over synth-beer. “That rookie you bumped into this morning? Titus Staples? Just met him properly in the bay. Introduced himself all polite-like—handshake and everything.”

Kelly’s cheeks warmed at the memory, a faint blush creeping up. “Yeah? He seemed… nice.”

Cathy’s eyes narrowed playfully, catching the flush. “You think he’s cute?”

Kelly’s smile widened, face turning even redder as she looked away. “Maybe.”

Cathy laughed, clapping her friend on the back. “I’m your friend, Kel, but darn—he is cute. And those eyes? Got that look of nobility, like old blood trying to hide, but with the politeness of a real commoner. Interesting mix. Russell’s gonna grind him down, but I bet he comes out shining.”

Kelly hid her deepening blush behind her mug, the conversation lingering long into the shift break as they speculated about the quiet new arrival who’d already caught more than one eye.

   And somewhere in Administration, Hale stared at the locked data chip from the blue-haired Winfield, its matte-black surface reflecting the harsh overhead light like a silent accusation. The memory of those luminous violet eyes and the ozone-scented threat still crawled across his skin. He remembered the brief report that had crossed his desk earlier—the outgoing comm request from Cadet Staples to a civilian contact on Phorantis, flagged automatically for new arrivals. A mother’s worried voice on the other end, the call cut short by cost. One thing Hale was absolutely certain of: he did not want another midnight-blue visitor gliding through his door without warning.

With a quiet exhale, he walked to his desk and pulled up Titus’s personnel file on the holo-screen. Scrolling past the standard intake data, he reached the subsection for communication approvals. His finger hovered a moment over the controls, then tapped decisively: outgoing comms—fees waived, duration allowance set to one full hour per month, effective immediately. No justification entered; none needed for an administrator of his rank. The change logged silently into the system.

Hale leaned back, rubbing the bridge of his nose. If the Blue were watching as closely as the Winfield claimed, a small gesture like this might buy goodwill—or at least keep those predatory eyes pointed elsewhere. The boy deserved the chance to speak to his mother without counting credits. And Hale… Hale simply wanted to sleep without wondering if a hooded silhouette would appear at his bedside.

He locked the screen, the data chip still resting heavy in the safe behind him. For now, the shadows held their distance.",1,1766162084.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False
1pqplnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pqplnt/im_31m_having_doubts_about_relationship_with_my/,"I'm (31M) having doubts about relationship with my GF (23F), how to move forward and is it feasible?","**TL;DR**: I've (31M) been dating my girlfriend (23F) for 6 months, and after a tough breakup with my ex (32F) after 9 years, I’m starting to doubt this relationship. I’m autistic and have been struggling with insomnia and mental health, but I’ve tried to be a good partner by helping my girlfriend and doing a lot for her. However, issues are arising. She’s uncomfortable with my relationship with my ex, even though we’re not romantic anymore, and things have been tense since I moved her in. Recently, we had a big argument where she accused me of not loving her, got really emotional, and pushed me. I’m not sure how to handle this emotional volatility and whether it’s worth continuing the relationship. I’m even considering putting cameras in my apartment, but I feel like that’s not healthy. How should I move forward?

  
I'm non-native so sorry for bad english. I’m in a relationship with F(23) for half year, and I'm(31M) starting to have some doubts. Some Backstory: I'm AuDHD and previously I've been in relationship with ex-gf (32F) for 9 years. I've broken with hear because we've had several relationship issues which made our relationship rocky for last 4 years - we didn't manage to solve them, but we became really close friends and overall better people and partners during that time. I was also suffering from burnout and insomnia since beginning of the year which I've started taking various psychiatric meds, from which last of them made me kind of not caring about a lot of stuff. While our breakup was emotional it was in good terms and there was a lot of care about each other from us both. Since we lived in my apartment and I was breaking party I told my ex-gf that she can live how much long she wants and she doesn't have to pay her half of the bills as I want her to have easiest transition possible. She decided that she wants to buy her own flat and move out ASAP. Since it was emotionally tough. We've also decided that we'll be living about 1/3 of time together as we need to be for that time in the city we live and rest of the time one of us will be at their parent's place.

2 weeks after breakup I've thought that since I've always had FWB before being in relationship and had almost no sex for the last 2-3 years I'll look for an FWB on tinder. After quick talk with gf we've met up and had great time, of which half of it we've spent talking. Since I was curious of her I've asked her to meet up next time just to grab a coffee. During that meeting we've clicked even more and We've started falling in love with each other. On a 5th meeting, where she did something very personal for me I was gone and since she seemed as a very mature person for her age I've decided to ignore the age difference (I've usually dated or hooked up with older women) and next time I've asked her to become couple which she has agreed on.

As I mentioned earlier, after the breakup with my ex-girlfriend, I continued to live with her for a while. We were on good terms, and I wanted to make her transition easier, but this started to create problems in my new relationship. My current gf has mentioned a few times that it’s hard for her to accept the fact that I'm on good terms with my ex, and that we live together, even if we’re not romantically involved anymore. It was really confusing for me because at the beginning my current gf said that it's nice that I can be nice with ex. I've also made mistake while handling the situation - while having talk about borders with ex-gf at the start of relationship I asked my current girlfriend if it would bother her if I walked around the apartment withouth clothes, for example after going out of shower, while my ex was there, since I had no problem with that. I explained to her that my ex and I hadn’t been intimate for years and that for me, nudity at home was just a normal thing. Which, after speaking that question sounded retarded for me and I've explained my self and told that I'm not going to do it anyway as obviously I wouldn't want to be in the same situation. At the time, she said she was okay with the question. However, later on, she brought it up again and said asking that question started feeding on her insecurities about living situation and blamed me on not explaining myself - while I did that couple of times, said I'm sorry, the question was stupid and explaining everything about reasoning in details.

Since my gf's living situation was not ideal as she lived with her sister which she didn't want to live with I've proposed to her that she can move in as soon as my exgf leaves, since we've both wanted to check the compatibility and frankly move in together as soon as possible. I've also told her that obviously I'm not going to throw ex-gf out and I can't really give her any ideal date as my ex had to apply for loan and do all the paperwork - so I can only work on estimated and I was always giving her any information I got from ex.

After I got 100% sure date when my ex is moving out I've told my gf that she can move in 7 week after that - I just wanted to clean up stuff and have everything ready for her moving in as doing that after she's living would be way harder. She started crying and saying that I didn't love her, didn't want her to move in as I'm misleading her all the time/changing the date (I was just giving all the information I've had at the moment). 2 hours after she calmed herself she said that she just wants to be there with me and clean all that stuff together, not me doing all the work, as she doesn't care about the mess but spending time with me which I've found cute. After that I've agreed for her to move in next day, she did that and it made getting everything done way longer process than it should.

We've also started having fights about my ex, as my current gf accused me of putting her in love triangle with my ex that's not even there anymore (I don't have contact with my ex besides sorting out formal stuff/sending each other stuff that belonged to other one/her wishing me happy birthday). My gf also said to me that she doesn't want to hear about ex and every detail on what I'm sending, and that it's also weird that I even care about sending some mugs to other person (I'm a type of person that when I have someone's belongings I'll do everything to get it back to them as I don't want to be stealing). This started being insulting to me as I do a lot of stuff in relationship: she lives in my apartment rent-free besides paying half the bills, since I almost don't use my car I allowed her to drive it to her work most of the time without even filling the gas, I have more spare time so I do all the chores besides cooking, I don't go for abroad holidays with my parents that they've offered to pay for since I want to spend as much time as possible with her, I've woke up and made breakfast and coffee each morning for her, buying flowers, always writing notes and all the stuff - basically I decided I don't want to fuck up this relationship and I want to care - I doubt she did half of what I did and I didn't really mind that as I love her. After some time we've stopped arguing and everything semed to be going in a good way.

However last month I was going off my sleeping pills and it was really bad. I've basically had hangover for 3 weeks, couldn't slept, felt really down and all the stuf that I didn't think about for past half year just came back. One day gf asked me what's wrong and I told her about everything I feel bad about - 10% of what included saying that I feel bad for not being better in relationship with my ex and that while I don't want to be in a relationship with her ever I kind of feel like person I've known for a long time died and now she's gone, and I'm missing that friendship. I've talked with it with my psychiatrist and he told me that's pretty normal after that long a relationship.

On the 3rd week of getting off my sleeping meds my gf was accusing me of hiding messenger since when she walked into the bedroom at the morning I've closed everything panicking - I didn't, I just close everything on my phone and focus my attention on her everytime she walks into the room, I'm not really a phone person. I told her that and that she can also check my messages if she wants to as I've got nothing to hide, she said she doesn't want to but that she knows what she's seen, we've started bickering about that and on the 3rd day she told me that she wants to see it. I've shown her the messages and there were ones from my ex, on a different day than I was supposed to hide messages, the content of the convo was that I asked her what to send/what to throw out and that we still didn't send each other our holiday pictures - and while I'm not in a hurry and I understand that it's too fresh to go through them, I'd still like to get them and that I still have my part of pictures. During that convo she also sent me a meme which I didn't reply to, only reacted with like since I didn't want to open anything but also didn't want to be rude.

My gf got mad and crying, started saying that I want to get back with my ex, that I'm a bad bf since I didn't have much interactions (Most of the time I was reading books or playing video games, but I did also spend some time on talking with her or watching series together) with her in past weeks. I also got irritated at that since I don't think that being civilized with ex and just wanting to get a rest and told her that. After 2 hours she said that she's sorry about her behaviour and we've went to bed - she went for sleep but I've slept about 4 hours as I couldn't fall asleep from the stress. Next day it was weird between us, but I've still made her coffee and offered her to drive with my car to her work so that she won't have to commute while being tired.

When she came back from work it was still weird, she wanted to discuss yesterday talk, I didn't as I've felt really bad and not in the mental capability to dicuss anything. Gf said that she doesn't want to leave bad atmosphere and I've agreed to that, I've asked her what she wants to start with because honestly I have no idea, she told me that she also doesn't have an idea. After some time we went from no idea to me being lier, hung up on my ex and stuff like that. I didn't want to sit on the couch with her because I don't like not being in move while being stressed, so I've standed up and started walking in circles. She told me that it stresses her out and that she wants me to sit, I told her that I don't like to sit and that she can also stand up. I've also told her what evidence is that I'm lying and asked her to take responsibility for that words, think about it and explain it to me. She accused me of being aggresive. After some bickering she started crying and screaming that I should've just sit with her and hug her, and told her that I only care about her. I've told her that after her accusations now it's not only her having problem with me, but also me having problem with her and that I want her taking responsibility on what she was telling. After that she started creaming and hitting her head with hands. After that she went to the bedroom to cry, where I went with her to check up with her. I've asked her can I hug her, whether she wants to talk, or not, she just went with crying and saying that I don't love her, that I'm lying, that I'm shitty bf and so on. I've decided not to be punching bag because of someone's emotions and went out of the room. She got up, followed me and started screaming that she's moving out tomorrow, that I can go back to my ex and stuff like that, I told her ok, and after that she got in my face telling me that It's my fault with aggresive tone, on which I've stepped back, and after that she pushed me with her hand. I've asked her what she was doing and she want back to the bedroom and she hit her head on the wall once or twice. I went to check up on her and managed to calm her down, we've managed to talk about my ex and cleared that down, however during the whole convo I've felt like she wanted me to cut my ex, which sounds retarded because I don't really have contact with her, so what am I supposed to do? After that we've talked about her pushing me and she was denying that saying that she didn't push me but she wanted to grab me for my atention as I was ignoring her. I told her that it was bulshit and she should take responsibility for that, she started crying saying that she loves me and would never do that. After some time she calmed down and promised me that she will never again tell me that she leaves or push me and that she's sorry - however I still don't feel she took responsibility for anything.

However it's 5 days after that and I still don't feel really good or safe in relationship as I feel each time we have discussion she lets her emotions take over her, and I just can't function on that level of emotionallity - I think that since my autism I just want to solve issues. How to move forward? Is there even a point in that or is being in a relationship with her setting me up for further issues in the future? Now I'm thinking about putting up cameras in my flat just not to have any nasty surprises in the future and I don't think that's normal",1,1766162072.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

They insisted they want me at home with them and I stayed.

Now, I’m planning to close it in a week and planning to leave because my apartment is alone for more then a month and I have no idea if everything is fine and my bills are not payed (I am renting it).

But the thing is - While we were drinking coffee, my dad mentioned how he made a plan and already decided everything that he and mom will visit my brother for 5 days and they want me to stay at home for that time.

The reason for this is : they want someone to “watch out” the house because someone can steal something and because they have cats and one dog. The dog is on a leash and he needs food of course.

My dad said “you should sometimes adapt to us” and I used to drive back home (here) few times exactly for this reason. I would spend money, time and risk my work.

I said they should go for 3-4 days. On the first day they could give food to the dog and leave the rest of it for second or third day and they should go back.

But they say that is not enough for them, they want to stay more at my brothers home.

I am disappointed to be honest, because my whole life they would somehow find a way to tie me and never grew up actually.

I found the courage to leave 1 year ago but somehow they always find a way for it again.

The most fundamental thing I find is that very few people seem interested in (or even capable of) actually contributing any sort of substance to the conversation - as in, any sort of information about themselves or a question, anecdote, etc.

I'm not just looking to text all day, obviously, I want to see if there's a good vibe and make plans to get a coffee or something if there are, but Jesus Christ it's like trying pull teeth getting literally *anything* out of these people, like they just don't know how to hold a conversation at all. I've mentioned movies I watched recently (usually foreign) and had at least three grown-ass adults tell me they won't watch anything with subtitles because it's ""too hard.""

I also find people seem weirdly incurious about pretty much anything, I legitimately asked someone on a date what time what they were interested in or any hobbies they have and they legitimately thought really hard for about twenty seconds before admitting they couldn't come up with anything. I was fucking dumbfounded.

The shittiest part though is that I think often times I'm taking their replies as a lack of interest, so I'll just stop responding, but then 9 times out of 10 within a day or two I do get the 'hey' text back, so it's like I don't know how to distinguish between someone being just totally uninterested vs just totally incapable of conversing with any sort of personality whatsoever.

I do definitely feel like it's something that's gotten worse since COVID, like I don't remember it feeling as frequent where it feels like I'm trying to play tetherball with someone that has no arms. I know this isn't a unique experience, but I just feel like I have to acknowledge this every once in a while because it's just massively frustrating.",1,1766161742.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I know this sounds backwards—but hear me out.



For years, I did the whole “wake up at 5 AM, grind harder, burn more calories” routine.

Early workouts. Cold coffee. Constant fatigue.



And somehow… my belly fat wouldn’t budge.



Turns out, the problem wasn’t effort.

It was stress.

The Trend Changing the Conversation: Sleepmaxxing



No, it’s not just “sleep more.”



Sleepmaxxing = intentionally lowering cortisol before bed so your body can actually switch into repair + fat-burning mode overnight.



Think of it as:



Weight loss by removing stress instead of adding more.

The Sleepmaxxing “Hacks” Everyone’s Talking About



1. The Sleepy Girl Mocktail

This is all over US TikTok right now.



Usually:



Tart cherry juice (natural melatonin support)



Magnesium powder (calms the nervous system)



People swear it helps them fall asleep faster and wake up less groggy

3. No Phone / Red Light Before Bed

Blue light late at night = circadian rhythm chaos.



A lot of people now:



Switch to warm red lighting



Turn off phones 60 minutes before sleep



Not exciting—but surprisingly powerful.

3. Red Light / No Phone Before Bed

Reducing blue light exposure 60 minutes before sleep.



Many people switch to:



Warm or red lighting



No phone or doom-scrolling late at night



Not exciting—but often effective

He posponed it few times before it was eventually agreed. I have met two of his cousins with their wifes/ gf last weekend.

My bf temporarily lives with his parents while waiting for his property. One of his brothers is a regular at parents house and his new gf ( they’ve been together 3-4 months longer than we have) has been there for dinner at least twice, and my bf said she is probably joining for drinks in the evening. The mum told my bf to get her a Christmas gift so it looks like she will be there. Then two days later they celebrate a nephews bday and she will also be there. I have not been invited to any of this and my bf only loosely said we are meeting in the pub on the 25th before lunch, you are welcome to join if you want. I invited him over to my family dinner on 24th, he said he’d talk to his mum about 26th but I have not heard back anything and it has been few days now.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a tale of two teams that could teach a masterclass in *how not to spell “punctuation”*—but let’s focus on basketball, shall we? The Washington Huskies (9-2) and Stanford Cardinal (9-2) clash on December 20, 2025, in a game so evenly matched, it’s like trying to split a $5 bill at a coffee shop. Let’s break this down with the precision of a caffeinated barista and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many lattes.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two .583s

First, the numbers. Stanford is the slight favorite at **-250** (implied probability: 71.4%) on DraftKings, while Washington sits at **+220** (28.6%). The spread? Stanford -2.5. The total? A svelte **125.5 points**. These odds suggest Stanford’s margin of victory will be about the length of a regulation yoga class—just enough to make you question your life choices.

Why the edge for Stanford? They’ve won their last two games by an average of **19 points**, including a 14-point drubbing of UT Arlington despite missing star freshman Ebuka Okorie. Their big men—Chisom Okpara (17 ppg) and AJ Rohosy (13 ppg)—are like two overfilled mugs of coffee: imposing, caffeinated, and ready to spill on you if you get too close. Washington, meanwhile, has eked out close wins, including an 84-76 victory over then-No. 24 USC. They’re the underdog who shows up to a poker game wearing a “I Heart Tournaments” T-shirt—underestimated but not unprepared.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Depth, and the Ghost of Ebuka Past

Stanford’s recent win over UT Arlington was a masterclass in efficiency. With Okorie (their 15.1 ppg scorer) sidelined, the Cardinal leaned on their bench and big men to post a 40-25 halftime lead. Think of it as a group project where everyone pulls their weight—even the guy who’s been aslee

We’re very aware of the Find Me Gluten Free app and it’s already been hugely helpful, but I’m conscious that some of the best spots never quite rise to the top of an app list. So I thought I’d ask here.

Rough route:  
LA → Joshua Tree → Yuma → Tucson → Truth or Consequences → White Sands → Roswell → Carlsbad Caverns → Albuquerque → Flagstaff → Grand Canyon → Boulder City → Death Valley

We’re mostly staying in smaller towns and national parks, so we’re realistic, but we’d love to know:

* Any independent restaurants you’d go out of your way for
* Places with dedicated fryers
* Great coffee spots
* Pubs/Bars
* Or anywhere you’d say “don’t miss this, even if it’s a slight detour”

Chains are fine when needed, but we prefer independents where possible.

Because of a knee injury and the misinformation and ignorance I had, I injured myself and developed two disc bulges (l4-l5 and l5-s1) that now prevent me from sitting and lifting anything at the gym. I don’t care that much about lifting heavy weights, I just want to feel human again. I want to be able to go out, have a coffee, sit down, and not have to worry so much about my symptoms.

I don’t know what I should do. A month ago I took prednisone for five days and all my symptoms completely disappeared, and I was the happiest person in the world. However, after a plane trip where I was sitting for several hours, all the symptoms came back: back pain in the lumbar area, which is not unbearable but is constant, and fear of movement because I genuinely don’t know if I’m doing too much or too little. I am doing all the exercises that physical therapy prescribed, but I don’t know what is normal, I don’t know how much pain it is normal to tolerate.

Today I have had some sciatica-like symptoms; I feel a slight, very slight burning sensation in my legs and on the inner part of my knee. Yesterday I bought a back brace, but I know that there are other people who have been very successful in recovering without surgery and without lumbar injections. My whole family is worried because I have started having suicidal ideation, and they say that we should then consider surgery or consider getting an injection, but I know there are people who manage to overcome this, and genuinely, looking at my MRI, it doesn’t look serious at all.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans where the Utah Mammoth (-138) will face the New Jersey Devils (+116) in a game that promises more goals than a buffet table at a penguin party. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a hockey player trying to explain a penalty kill.

**Odds & Ends: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Utah’s implied probability of winning sits at \~58% (thanks to their -138 line), while New Jersey’s 46.5% suggests they’re the underdog in a game where even their most optimistic fans might need a second cup of coffee. The over/under of 5.5 goals is a tantalizing number, especially since Utah’s last 10 games have averaged 3.4 goals scored and 2.7 allowed. Combine that with New Jersey’s porous defense (3.1 goals conceded per game) and you’ve got a popcorn machine of scoring chances. The “Over” is the logical pick, unless you’re betting on the number of times a player will accidentally shoot the puck into their own net.

**Injury Report: The New Jersey Edition**  
New Jersey’s injury list reads like a who’s-who of “Where’d They Go?” Timo Meier, Jack Hughes, and seven other players are out, which is about the same number of functioning skates the Devils might have in their locker room. Meanwhile, Utah’s only scratches are Logan Cooley and Alexander Kerfoot—two guys who, if they were in a band, would be the backup guitarists. With New Jersey’s roster looking like a Russian novel (too many characters, all with sad fates), it’s no wonder their goal differential (-8) is worse than a toddler’s math homework.
