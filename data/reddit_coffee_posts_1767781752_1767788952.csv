( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1q6e193,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q6e193/5_stages_of_friendship_most_people_never_get_past/,5 stages of friendship (most people never get past stage 3),"Ever noticed how a ton of your “friends” are just people you kind of talk to sometimes? You have work friends, gym friends, party friends. But how many of them could you actually call at 2am when your life is falling apart? That number is usually… small. Like, really small.



And that’s not a “you” problem. It’s just where most friendships naturally plateau. After looking into this a lot more, through research, social psych books, and even podcasts on intimacy, it became clear that friendship goes way deeper than most of us realize. Way beyond just “vibing” or “doing stuff together.”



But most people stop at stage 2 or 3. Not because they’re lazy or fake, but because deeper friendship requires emotional openness, consistency, and facing some pretty uncomfortable stuff. 



Here’s what the research (not TikTok) shows about the 5 stages of friendship, and why real closeness is so rare. Let’s make it less rare.





1. Stranger to acquaintance  

   You meet. You exchange names. Maybe a few polite facts. It ends there unless someone initiates more.



   \- Psychology professor Jeffrey Hall found in his 2018 friendship study that it takes around 50 hours to move from acquaintance to casual friend. That’s a lot of small talk and “hey what do you do” convos.

   \- These connections are surface-level but still functional. You know their face and maybe their dog’s name. That’s it.



2. Acquaintance to casual friend  

   You start seeing them more regularly. There’s shared context: work, gym class, mutual friends.



   \- Hall’s research also showed that at 90+ hours, you start getting into casual friend territory. You can joke around. You may know their coffee order. But the convo is still kind of curated.

   \- This is where most social media “friends” stop. You “know of” each other but aren’t really emotionally invested.



3. Casual friend to meaningful friend  

   Now you’re sharing more personal details. Talking about values, struggles, not just schedules and shows.



   \- According to Shasta Nelson (author of Frientimacy), this stage involves “consistency + vulnerability + positivity”. All three are needed to push past emotional inertia.

   \- Research from the University of Kansas shows it takes about 200 hours together to get to this level. Not just time, but quality time. Think: late-night convos, real arguments, trips together.

   \- Problem is, this is where things can get “risky.” You start realizing: do we really align, or did we just like the same memes?



4. Friendship intimacy  

   You feel understood, seen, and accepted. You support each other in real ways. The relationship feels secure.



   \- Dr. Vivek Murthy (U.S. Surgeon General) talks about this in Together: that deep friendship protects against loneliness better than romantic relationships in some cases. But we rarely invest in it.

   \- This stage often requires repairing ruptures. Disappointments, calling each other out, being awkwardly honest. Most avoid it, so friendships die quietly.

   \- Also, this level of trust can trigger old attachment wounds if someone grew up without stable relationships. That’s why many self-sabotage here without realizing.



5. Chosen family  

   This is rare. But real. These are the friends you’d drop everything for. They know you, past, flaws, dreams, and love you anyway.



   \- Esther Perel explains in her podcast Where Should We Begin that chosen family is built by “mutual rituals of care.” You show up, over and over. That builds “earned intimacy.”

   \- These friends don’t just watch your stories. They’ll sit with you through your worst nights, call you on your B.S., and still remember your big interview.

   \- The difference? This kind of bonded friendship is active, not passive. It isn’t built on vibes. It’s built on loyalty and shared history.





Most adults stop at stage 3 because our schedules are packed, we’re scared of emotional vulnerability, and we assume closeness either “clicks or it doesn’t.” But that’s wrong. Research shows deep friendship isn’t magical. It’s intentional.



Quick ways to deepen a friendship (based on relational psych research):



\- Ask better questions, like “What’s something you wish more people knew about you?” (The 36 Questions from Aron et al. are great for this)

\- Initiate more. Reach out when nothing’s wrong. Plan stuff.

\- Name the friendship. Literally say, “I really value our friendship” or “Can I be real with you for a sec?”

\- Repair ruptures. Apologize when you mess up. Give grace when others do.

\- Create rituals. Monthly cafe catch-ups, Sunday walks, shared hobby, predictable time = deeper bonding over time.



Friendship isn’t less important than romantic or family relationships. The problem is, no one teaches us how to build real ones. So we settle for stage 3.



Let’s stop settling.

From that conversation, this post was formed.* 

The basketball world is littered with stories about uber-talented players who never reached their full potential. Ask nearly any coach who has been involved in the game for a while, and I guarantee they will have at least one of those guys, the player who had all the skills but who couldn’t get out of their own way.

**Kevin Pangos is not one of those guys.**

Out of all the professional players I’ve been around, he has squeezed more out of less than any of them. What he has accomplished in his career is nothing short of remarkable. This isn’t a knock on Kevin; it’s quite the opposite. He’s one of the biggest overachievers I’ve been around.

Here’s just a taste of his career accomplishments to date:

* All-EuroLeague First Team (2021)
* All-EuroLeague Second Team (2018)
* All-EuroCup Second Team (2016)
* 2× Lithuanian League champion (2017, 2018)
* All-Lithuanian League Team (2018)
* Lithuanian League Foreign Player of the Year (2018)
* All-VTB United League Second Team (2021)
* Third-team All-American – AP, NABC, TSN (2015)
* WCC Player of the Year (2015)
* 4× First-team All-WCC (2012–2015)
* WCC Newcomer of the Year (2012)

And if that laundry list of awards and accomplishments wasn’t enough, you can sprinkle in the fact that Kevin is the youngest player to ever play for the Canadian senior national basketball team at the age of 15 in the summer of 2009, more on that to come.

Kevin has the two common ingredients I’ve seen in players who punch above their weight class and overachieve: Grit and Creativity.

His grit is on display daily. This guy has battled through countless injuries throughout his career. I highly doubt there’s ever been a day when he’s been fully healthy. He pushes himself to his absolute limit in everything: training, games, practice, and recovery.

Many people possess grit; in the world of elite athletes, it's more common than you might think. Creativity, on the other hand, is far rarer, and it’s the essential element needed to make it at the highest levels when you are a lower class of *raw* athlete than almost everyone else you’re competing against.

If Kevin were to see and play the game through the same lens as players considerably more athletic than he is, he would never have reached the heights he has. His greatest strength isn’t his jumper, even though it’s purer than a bottle of Aqua Panna. Or his handles, even though they’re sharper than a straight-edge razor. No, his most significant strength is his mind.

Kevin has found a way to see the game through his unique lens. This enables him to play to the beat of his drum, find angles others wouldn’t, and ensure he’s squeezing the most he can out of his abilities for the good of the team.

I asked Kevin to share that mind with Low Man Help, and he graciously agreed. As good a player as Kevin is, he’s even a better person. I believe it’s a clause in every Canadian birth certificate that families must agree to before leaving the hospital, it’s the Canadian version of a car seat check: “Do you agree to be a good person and love Tim Horton’s coffee above all others?”

Anyways, without further ado, here are three lessons Kevin Pangos would go back and tell his younger self.



# Lessons To Young Kev…

My basketball journey has taken me all over the world: Gonzaga University, Spain (a lot of times), Lithuania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and even a season in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But as I sat down to think about the lessons I’d want to share with younger players, something I wasn’t expecting became apparent: the most impactful lessons I’ve learned have had a lot less to do with basketball than I would have imagined.

The game has tested me in ways I never expected and shaped me into the person I am today. If I could go back and talk to young Kev, that little kid shooting for hours outside, the one who was overly anxious before big games and would often compare himself to other basketball players, I’d share three simple thoughts.

Even though many people reading this may have heard these before, I find myself replaying something Marc would always say to me, “Just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it’s easy.”

Here are the three simple lessons that changed everything for me:

# 1. Learn How To Work Smart and Hard; Not Just Hard

When I was younger, I prided myself on being the hardest worker at my craft. I’d shoot 500 shots on most days, dedicate a few more hours to my body for performance or recovery, and eat foods I didn’t like just because I knew they might give me the slightest edge at reaching my dreams. Now looking back, I by no means think that was the wrong thing to do. I believe dedication and effort set me apart from my competition. However, it became apparent to me later on in my career that I wasn’t always working *smart*. A lot of those reps weren’t game-speed, and I didn’t have a clear purpose behind what I was doing. I just always associated more = better.

It wasn’t until I became very intentional in how I did things that I noticed the difference it could make in my growth. I stopped wasting reps. I started going full game speed, visualizing in-game situations, and knowing exactly *which* shots I was taking, *how* I needed to execute them, and *why* they would be effective.

I stopped guessing about athletic development and began learning about my body, movement patterns, and the instabilities or lack of range I had. My strength coach and mentor, Matt Nichol, taught me the power of taking ownership of my physical development, from mobility and recovery to nutrition and everything in between. From that point forward, training wasn’t just about *working more*; it was about *working right.*

If I could tell my younger self one thing here, it would be:

Hard work is non-negotiable, but smart work is what separates good from great.

# 2. Your Biggest Fears Will Shape You

We all have fears that live in our heads, missing a game-winner, getting cut, embarrassing ourselves in front of a crowd, failing to reach a goal we set out years earlier.

One of my biggest fears was being judged by others.

I never wanted to fail. The thought of failing in front of peers and embarrassing myself terrified me to the core. So, when I got invited to train with the Canadian men’s national basketball team at the age of 15, you can imagine how intense my initial reaction was to the possibility of failing as a 15-year-old against a grown man already playing professional basketball.

I spent the entire camp nervous and anxious, just trying to put my head down and work my ass off. I thought I could finally exhale after a successful camp where I performed well; however... Just before heading home, I was invited on a two-week trip to Italy with the full roster. Now, hearing that you would again think “That’s amazing!”. But, for me, an instant pit in my stomach formed. I had just made it through a successful camp, and now every alarm in my body was going off once again; it was like I was experiencing impostor syndrome.

But I knew what to do. I had to meet my fear head-on.

That trip completely changed my life at 15. I was surrounded by pros for two whole weeks. I tried to absorb everything I could, from how they approached the game to how they carried themselves, and the small ways they found to improve every single day.

I built lifelong relationships and gained lessons I carry with me to this day.[1](#footnote-1)

Going forward, I faced many other difficult moments throughout my career. Things I feared about happening to me. Not performing at the level expected. Bad Injuries. Getting cut from teams.

However, my experience from that camp at 15 helped me realize that those extremely difficult moments can become the most influential.

That month with the National Team taught me resilience, built my confidence, and reminded me that fear is way more in your head than in reality. In fact, it often leads to your biggest growth and a realization that you can handle more than you ever imagined. A growth you would not have come across had you not been through that specific situation.

# 3. You Are Enough; Don’t Compare Yourself to Others.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned, and continue to practice, is not comparing myself to others. It’s so easy to do in sports and life.

For years, I obsessed over things I couldn’t control: my height, my inverted wingspan, my smaller hands. I looked around the NBA and saw guys with freakish athleticism, long arms, and massive hands. I told myself that was what I lacked to play at the highest level.

But those thoughts weren’t helping me. Working with my sports psychologist (shoutout Dr. H), I started to understand what was really going on. Deep down, I didn’t fully believe I was enough.

That changed everything.

Once I stopped seeing those physical traits as weaknesses, I started using them to my advantage. My shot got quicker. I played lower to the ground. I changed direction better. I became more dangerous because I finally *believed I was enough.*

I always think of an iconic image of Michael Phelps from the Olympics, he’s in the lead, focused straight ahead, while his competitor is looking sideways at him. The competitor slowed himself down by focusing on someone else. That’s what comparison does.

Your journey is your journey. *You are enough.*

When I think about having the opportunity to talk to the younger version of myself, the one in the empty gym late at night, the one sweating through nerves before a big moment, the one silently wondering if he’ll measure up, I’d tell him these three simple things:

1. Learn how to work smart, so your hard work is amplified.
2. Don’t fear fear, lean in. Your biggest growth can come from these moments.
3. Never forget that you are enough.

These lessons have carried me through college, the EuroLeague, the NBA, and back overseas. They’ve shaped not only my career but who I am as a person. And for that, I’m grateful for the good moments, the tough ones, and everything in between.

And if that laundry list of awards and accomplishments wasn’t enough, you can sprinkle in the fact that Kevin is the youngest player to ever play for the Canadian senior national basketball team at the age of 15 in the summer of 2009, more on that to come.

Kevin has the two common ingredients I’ve seen in players who punch above their weight class and overachieve: Grit and Creativity.

His grit is on display daily. This guy has battled through countless injuries throughout his career. I highly doubt there’s ever been a day when he’s been fully healthy. He pushes himself to his absolute limit in everything: training, games, practice, and recovery.

Many people possess grit; in the world of elite athletes, it's more common than you might think. Creativity, on the other hand, is far rarer, and it’s the essential element needed to make it at the highest levels when you are a lower class of *raw* athlete than almost everyone else you’re competing against.

If Kevin were to see and play the game through the same lens as players considerably more athletic than he is, he would never have reached the heights he has. His greatest strength isn’t his jumper, even though it’s purer than a bottle of Aqua Panna. Or his handles, even though they’re sharper than a straight-edge razor. No, his most significant strength is his mind.

Kevin has found a way to see the game through his unique lens. This enables him to play to the beat of his drum, find angles others wouldn’t, and ensure he’s squeezing the most he can out of his abilities for the good of the team.

I asked Kevin to share that mind with Low Man Help, and he graciously agreed. As good a player as Kevin is, he’s even a better person. I believe it’s a clause in every Canadian birth certificate that families must agree to before leaving the hospital, it’s the Canadian version of a car seat check: “Do you agree to be a good person and love Tim Horton’s coffee above all others?”

Anyways, without further ado, here are three lessons Kevin Pangos would go back and tell his younger self.



# Lessons To Young Kev…

My basketball journey has taken me all over the world: Gonzaga University, Spain (a lot of times), Lithuania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and even a season in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But as I sat down to think about the lessons I’d want to share with younger players, something I wasn’t expecting became apparent: the most impactful lessons I’ve learned have had a lot less to do with basketball than I would have imagined.

The game has tested me in ways I never expected and shaped me into the person I am today. If I could go back and talk to young Kev, that little kid shooting for hours outside, the one who was overly anxious before big games and would often compare himself to other basketball players, I’d share three simple thoughts.

Even though many people reading this may have heard these before, I find myself replaying something Marc would always say to me, “Just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it’s easy.”

Here are the three simple lessons that changed everything for me:

# 1. Learn How To Work Smart and Hard; Not Just Hard

When I was younger, I prided myself on being the hardest worker at my craft. I’d shoot 500 shots on most days, dedicate a few more hours to my body for performance or recovery, and eat foods I didn’t like just because I knew they might give me the slightest edge at reaching my dreams. Now looking back, I by no means think that was the wrong thing to do. I believe dedication and effort set me apart from my competition. However, it became apparent to me later on in my career that I wasn’t always working *smart*. A lot of those reps weren’t game-speed, and I didn’t have a clear purpose behind what I was doing. I just always associated more = better.

It wasn’t until I became very intentional in how I did things that I noticed the difference it could make in my growth. I stopped wasting reps. I started going full game speed, visualizing in-game situations, and knowing exactly *which* shots I was taking, *how* I needed to execute them, and *why* they would be effective.

I stopped guessing about athletic development and began learning about my body, movement patterns, and the instabilities or lack of range I had. My strength coach and mentor, Matt Nichol, taught me the power of taking ownership of my physical development, from mobility and recovery to nutrition and everything in between. From that point forward, training wasn’t just about *working more*; it was about *working right.*

If I could tell my younger self one thing here, it would be:

Hard work is non-negotiable, but smart work is what separates good from great.

# 2. Your Biggest Fears Will Shape You

We all have fears that live in our heads, missing a game-winner, getting cut, embarrassing ourselves in front of a crowd, failing to reach a goal we set out years earlier.

One of my biggest fears was being judged by others.

I never wanted to fail. The thought of failing in front of peers and embarrassing myself terrified me to the core. So, when I got invited to train with the Canadian men’s national basketball team at the age of 15, you can imagine how intense my initial reaction was to the possibility of failing as a 15-year-old against a grown man already playing professional basketball.

I spent the entire camp nervous and anxious, just trying to put my head down and work my ass off. I thought I could finally exhale after a successful camp where I performed well; however... Just before heading home, I was invited on a two-week trip to Italy with the full roster. Now, hearing that you would again think “That’s amazing!”. But, for me, an instant pit in my stomach formed. I had just made it through a successful camp, and now every alarm in my body was going off once again; it was like I was experiencing impostor syndrome.

But I knew what to do. I had to meet my fear head-on.

That trip completely changed my life at 15. I was surrounded by pros for two whole weeks. I tried to absorb everything I could, from how they approached the game to how they carried themselves, and the small ways they found to improve every single day.

I built lifelong relationships and gained lessons I carry with me to this day.[1](#footnote-1)

Going forward, I faced many other difficult moments throughout my career. Things I feared about happening to me. Not performing at the level expected. Bad Injuries. Getting cut from teams.

However, my experience from that camp at 15 helped me realize that those extremely difficult moments can become the most influential.

That month with the National Team taught me resilience, built my confidence, and reminded me that fear is way more in your head than in reality. In fact, it often leads to your biggest growth and a realization that you can handle more than you ever imagined. A growth you would not have come across had you not been through that specific situation.

# 3. You Are Enough; Don’t Compare Yourself to Others.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned, and continue to practice, is not comparing myself to others. It’s so easy to do in sports and life.

For years, I obsessed over things I couldn’t control: my height, my inverted wingspan, my smaller hands. I looked around the NBA and saw guys with freakish athleticism, long arms, and massive hands. I told myself that was what I lacked to play at the highest level.

But those thoughts weren’t helping me. Working with my sports psychologist (shoutout Dr. H), I started to understand what was really going on. Deep down, I didn’t fully believe I was enough.

That changed everything.

Once I stopped seeing those physical traits as weaknesses, I started using them to my advantage. My shot got quicker. I played lower to the ground. I changed direction better. I became more dangerous because I finally *believed I was enough.*

I always think of an iconic image of Michael Phelps from the Olympics, he’s in the lead, focused straight ahead, while his competitor is looking sideways at him. The competitor slowed himself down by focusing on someone else. That’s what comparison does.

Your journey is your journey. *You are enough.*

When I think about having the opportunity to talk to the younger version of myself, the one in the empty gym late at night, the one sweating through nerves before a big moment, the one silently wondering if he’ll measure up, I’d tell him these three simple things:

1. Learn how to work smart, so your hard work is amplified.
2. Don’t fear fear, lean in. Your biggest growth can come from these moments.
3. Never forget that you are enough.

These lessons have carried me through college, the EuroLeague, the NBA, and back overseas. They’ve shaped not only my career but who I am as a person. And for that, I’m grateful for the good moments, the tough ones, and everything in between.

From that conversation, this post was formed.* 

The basketball world is littered with stories about uber-talented players who never reached their full potential. Ask nearly any coach who has been involved in the game for a while, and I guarantee they will have at least one of those guys, the player who had all the skills but who couldn’t get out of their own way.

**Kevin Pangos is not one of those guys.**

Out of all the professional players I’ve been around, he has squeezed more out of less than any of them. What he has accomplished in his career is nothing short of remarkable. This isn’t a knock on Kevin; it’s quite the opposite. He’s one of the biggest overachievers I’ve been around.

Here’s just a taste of his career accomplishments to date:

* All-EuroLeague First Team (2021)
* All-EuroLeague Second Team (2018)
* All-EuroCup Second Team (2016)
* 2× Lithuanian League champion (2017, 2018)
* All-Lithuanian League Team (2018)
* Lithuanian League Foreign Player of the Year (2018)
* All-VTB United League Second Team (2021)

I did not previously report the stalking because I was afraid of escalating the situation and being put in greater danger. My stalker always found me in person, so I have no paper trail of anything. Unfortunately, the situation has now worsened.

At the same time, I have been displaced from my original apartment in a Section 8 project due to confirmed mold. I have a **project-based voucher** and I am now being told to move into another unit within the same complex. That unit already smells moldy, but unlike my original apartment, it has not been mold-tested, so I do not currently have documentation.

As I was preparing for this move, my stalker found me in town n person and told me he was “excited” that I would be closer to him again as of January 15. I believed he had moved on during the nearly four months I’ve been displaced, but he resurfaced and made it clear—during an in-person encounter at a coffee shop—that he intends to resume contact once I move back.

I do not have proof of the many times he stalked me at my original apartment because he always found me in person and I was trying to avoid him and hoped the behavior would stop. I was too afraid to file a police report at the time. Being displaced for months led me to believe the threat had passed, but his recent statements have made it clear that it has not.

Given the combination of:

* displacement due to mold,
* pressure to move into another potentially unsafe unit, and
* a renewed and credible safety concern,

I am no longer able to sleep and do not feel safe returning to this complex.

My question is whether I can be approved to use my voucher elsewhere, or whether the lack of formal proof prevents that, despite the circumstances described above.

1q6dt2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Emmaolivy/comments/1q6dt2k/ai_vending_machines_revolutionizing_smart_retail/,AI Vending Machines: Revolutionizing Smart Retail and Automated Commerce,"AI vending machines are redefining the future of retail by combining artificial intelligence with automated selling systems to create a faster, smarter, and more personalized shopping experience. Unlike traditional vending machines that simply dispense preselected products, AI-powered vending machines can analyze customer behavior, manage inventory intelligently, and adapt in real time to changing demand. As consumers increasingly seek convenience, speed, and contactless interactions, AI vending machines are becoming a key solution for modern businesses across retail, food service, healthcare, and technology sectors.

One of the most significant features of AI vending machines is their ability to use data and machine learning to understand customer preferences. Through sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms, these machines can track purchasing patterns, identify popular products, and recommend items based on time of day, location, or previous sales trends. Some advanced AI vending machines even use computer vision to enable a “grab-and-go” experience, where customers simply take products and walk away while the system automatically detects the items and processes payment. This level of automation reduces friction, eliminates queues, and enhances customer satisfaction. For more: [Ai Vending Machine](https://www.kolvending.com/collections/ai-vending-machine)

Inventory management is another area where AI vending machines offer major advantages. Traditional vending machines often suffer from overstocking, understocking, or expired products due to manual monitoring. AI-driven systems solve this problem by providing real-time inventory tracking and predictive restocking. Using historical data and demand forecasting, AI vending machines can alert operators when products are running low, suggest optimal restocking schedules, and even adjust product placement to maximize sales. This not only reduces operational costs but also ensures that customers consistently find what they want, improving trust and repeat usage.

AI vending machines also play a powerful role in personalization and dynamic marketing. Integrated digital screens and smart interfaces allow machines to display targeted advertisements, promotions, and product suggestions based on user behavior or environmental factors. For example, on a hot day, an AI vending machine might highlight cold beverages, while in the morning it could promote coffee or breakfast items. Loyalty programs, discounts, and personalized offers can be automatically applied, creating an engaging retail experience similar to online shopping but delivered in a physical, on-the-spot format.

Security and payment innovation are essential components of AI vending machines. Advanced systems use facial recognition, age verification, and anti-theft computer vision to prevent fraud and ensure compliance with regulations, especially for age-restricted products. Cashless payments such as credit cards, mobile wallets, QR codes, and biometric authentication make transactions faster and safer. These features are particularly valuable in high-traffic public spaces like airports, metro stations, hospitals, and corporate offices, where speed and security are critical. For businesses, reduced theft and automated compliance translate into lower risk and higher profitability.

Beyond convenience and efficiency, AI vending machines are contributing to sustainability and smarter urban infrastructure. By optimizing inventory levels and reducing waste, especially in food and beverage vending, AI systems help minimize expired or unsold products. Energy-efficient components and smart power management further reduce environmental impact. In smart cities, AI vending machines can be integrated with broader digital ecosystems, providing data insights into consumer behavior, supporting local brands, or even serving public needs such as distributing masks, medicines, or emergency supplies. Their ability to operate 24/7 without human staffing makes them ideal for both commercial and social applications.

In summary, AI vending machines represent a major leap forward in automated retail. They combine artificial intelligence, data analytics, computer vision, and digital payments to deliver a seamless, personalized, and efficient shopping experience. For businesses, they offer lower operating costs, valuable consumer insights, and scalable growth opportunities. For consumers, they provide speed, convenience, and relevant product choices anytime and anywhere. As AI technology continues to evolve, AI vending machines will become even more intelligent, adaptive, and integrated into everyday life, positioning them as a cornerstone of the future of smart retail and automated commerce.",1,1767788049.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False

We’re kicking off 2026 with a ""Track Your Year in Data"" challenge. The idea is simple: instead of learning to code with boring ""toy"" datasets (like the Titanic), start with your own life.

1. **Pick one metric** (coffee, hours slept, mood, steps).
2. **Log it daily** in a simple text file or spreadsheet.
3. **In February,** use Python (or Excel) to visualize your first month.

It’s easier to learn syntax when you actually care about the data. If you want to join us, we’re sharing ideas and starter guides [here](https://community.dataquest.io/t/code-challenge-track-your-year-in-data/578500).

1q6dpoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1q6dpoq/a_guy_tried_to_claim_my_library_study_room/,"A guy tried to ""claim"" my library study room because he ""pays taxes""","

Yesterday I went to my local public library to use one of those small study rooms for a remote interview. You have to reserve them online, and they cap it at 2 hours so everyone gets a chance. I booked mine a week ago, showed up early, checked in at the front desk, and the librarian handed me the little sign with my end time on it. The room is basically a glass box with a table, a chair, and an outlet, so it’s not fancy, but it’s quiet and that was the whole point. About 10 minutes before my call I’m setting up my laptop, doing the awkward camera test, and I hear a knock. There’s this middle aged guy standing there with a big tote bag and a coffee, and he goes, ""Yeah I need this room."" I said, sorry, it’s reserved, I’m using it. He actually steps closer like he’s gonna just come in anyway and says, ""I’m here every day. They always let me use it, you can just move."" I pointed at the sign with my name and time on it and said I have an interview, I’ll be done at 3. He rolls his eyes and goes, ""That’s not my problem. I pay taxes, this is a public building. I’m not sitting out there with all those people."" Like the reading area was some kind of plague zone. I offered him the smaller table area near the windows and he says, ""No, I need a door. I have IMPORTANT calls."" The way he said important made me want to laugh, but I didn’t. Then he tells me I should go take my interview in my car if it matters so much.



He storms off and I think it’s over, but two minutes later he comes back with a different librarian and starts talking over me. ""She’s squatting in here, I told her I need it, I’m a regular."" The librarian looks at the sign, checks the iPad, and calmly says, ""This room is reserved under her name until 3:00. You can reserve the next available slot at 3:15."" He starts doing that performative sighing and says, ""This is ridiculous, I have a meeting, you can make an exception. I know the director."" The librarian just repeats, same tone, ""No. The policy is the policy."" He tries again, ""But I’m here every day, I spend money at the cafe, I shouldn’t have to plan ahead like a teenager."" The librarian goes, ""Then you should reserve ahead, like everyone else."" He stands there staring at us like we’re supposed to feel shame. Finally he says, ""Fine. I’m going to tell everyone how unprofessional this place is."" The librarian literally said, ""Okay."" and walked away. The guy lingered for a second and muttered something about people being selfish, then left. I got my interview done, and when I walked out at 3:01 he was sitting at a random table in the open area anyway, on his phone, looking totally fine. I don’t know why he needed a door so bad, other than needing to win.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I'm about to finish a new version of my work and when that happens I usually throw myself a party to celebrate with people I like. They get to see my new work first & have a fantastic time - I get to show my work with none of the pressures to sell, have to appease, negotiate, worry who's going to show up, etc. aka the stuff that comes with someone else paying for it, lol. Just a celebration of the art with friends. Video of my last one (just after a 3 hour install window) below in the comments.

I've just been using Peerspace and it's been working out great. I have my favorite place but this new piece requires more floor space. So, I'm going to have more wall space than I need and thought why not ask the girlies if any of you are artists that have something you want to show? Let's celebrate our art together?

In the video posted in comments, on the left side of the space are canvases. I'm not going to be bringing any of those, only showing the sculptures this time so there's going to be a lot more empty wall space and I'd love to see & support some amazing work.

I should be done and ready somewhere around mid-late February or beginning March. My work is time-based so there's a small window of sorts. I haven't chosen an exact spot yet but have some great choices and two other people would probably be the max for what I'm thinking. At this time, I can only offer wall space aka work that can be hung. Yes, free.

I'm not sure exact footage I can give you at this time but I can let you know in a few weeks. You will have to bring what you need to install & it will be same day.

I normally serve wine, sometimes food. This last one the amazing u/brewedbyjose was kind enough to provide us with his absolute artistry of coffee (he just had grand opening of first location - highly recommend!), and I had over 100 fortune cookies because my work is time / timeline based and talks about the future.

About me: Recently Saatchi Gallery London long-listed, used to have an  artist-owned gallery in 2020 so I can assist with install if you need it. Have had multiple group & solo shows in various locations. I can give you a description of my work but I use chatgpt to take notes while I am working & use it to write my drafts so there will be unedited em dashes, lol.

I travel a lot - this year was my first time to Maldives and also Bilbao (I went to see Frank Ghery & Richard Serra's work). I have synesthesia. I love SailGP, excited for World Cup (iykyk), just celebrated my 50th in Vermont & I am the human companion to a dog named Ocho. I love Liverpool and the New York Fucking Rangers, ha.

I'm not sure how to determine who I'll pick if there happens to be some interest here but perhaps one of you can help me with a way to do that? I do know I'd like it to be a member of this sub and at some point I'd want to meet to make sure we vibe. Again, this isn't for sales or write-ups - just a party to celebrate art & a great reason to get dressed up / have a beautiful night amongst good people. 

Anyone interested post your work in the comments & say hello!

TL;DR: Finishing a new body of work and throwing a no-pressure party with art (wine, good people, zero sales energy). I’ll have extra wall space and want to invite 1–2 artists from this sub to show their art for free. February/March. Come celebrate art.

1q6dnyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1q6dnyj/new_to_pourover_cant_seem_to_get_good_results/,New to pourover: can't seem to get good results unless I grind coarse and brew with low temp?,"Hey everyone. I got a v60 on November with a Fellow kettle for my bday. 

I have a ZP6 which I got a year ago and so far used for brewing with Aeropress.

I've playing with it for quite some time now, starting with the sacrosanct Hoffmann recipe. 

But he grinds quite fine and a very high temps, and I don't know how to make that work... If I grind at lower than 4 on the ZP6 and/or higher than 92/93°C I can't seem to get good results. The coffee tastes often dry with that unpleasant dry dusty aftertaste, or it will taste bitter. 

With the coffee I have right now, which is not high end pricey coffee but it's good coffee from a local torrefactor (it's a washed red caturra from Bolivia with a medium torrefaction that advertises notes of caramel, apricot and sweetness), I managed to get good results only by grinding coarser (starting at 4.5 and I'm at 4.7 now), with more beans (currently at 1:15) and brewing below 90°C: sweet cup with caramel notes, I can get the apricot sometimes but not always, and sometimes it tastes kinda bad which I surmise has to do with inconsistencies in my technique. 

As I read threads here and there, a lot of people also seem to grind quite fine for pourover and brew with really high temps (though others seem to brew mainly at 85°C...)

It's kinda hard to compute all of that. Grinding fine and brew at high temp only works for really light roasts? Or is there something with my technique that's wrong? I'm fine with brewing at lower, but then my cup cools down quickly and I have to drink it quick which is a shame lol. 

Also I usually brew 300ml cups with 20gr coffee. How high should the water reach before I start slowing down the pouring to maintain thermal mass? On my v02 it usually only gets around halfway up. I need around 50gr water for the bloom otherwise it will just cake, and then I pour in circles until I reach around 150gr and then center pour the rest slowly. For the concentric pouring step I try not to agitate too much. I get some mushy fines on the sides of the filter and I also wonder if that's normal.
 And finally my ZP6 seems like it can't really go below 0.9 or 0.8 without blocking (I don't want to try lol): is that normal too? 

All in all as much as Aeropress was really consistent, pourover seems hard to compute and understand all parameters, but I hope I will be getting there.
I have ordered high end coffee but I will be frustrated if I have to spend half the bag dialing it in lol.

Thank you so much!",3,1767787613.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

Just get a temp-control kettle.,"Honestly, I wish I realized this with my first kid. We bought a dedicated bottle warmer and standing there for 5 minutes waiting for it to heat up while the baby is screaming at 3 AM is pure torture.

We eventually switched to a smart kettle with a 'Hold Temp' feature (set to 104°F/40°C), and it’s been a game changer. The water is just... ready. Instantly. You pour, mix, and feed. Zero waiting.

Plus, now that we are past the formula stage, I actually have a great kettle for my coffee instead of a plastic gadget collecting dust in the garage.

I feel frozen, numb, and unable to trust myself","Throwaway account because I feel stuck and I’m having trouble trusting my own judgment.

I’ve been with my partner for several years and we have a young child together. After a series of conflicts, I feel emotionally wiped out and frozen in place. I don’t have the energy to leave, but I also feel like I’m slowly fading away—numb, disconnected, and unable to act.

The core issue is that when I express discomfort, fear, or unmet needs, my partner invalidates them. Recently I told him that sometimes I feel intimidated by him because he’s unpredictable, critical, and easily irritated. He responded that this was extremely hurtful and unfair, and gave me an ultimatum: either I change my outlook on him and acknowledge my daily “failures,” or he will move out. He refuses couples therapy and says there’s nothing to discuss unless I first admit what I’m doing wrong.

On New Year’s Eve, during a family dinner, several things happened:

Before leaving, he became irritated and reproachful because I forgot to bring certain glasses and because I didn’t bring the keys to my parent's (which was easily resolved). I had taken care of other things like bringing food.

Once there, he complained that the glasses available weren’t “tall enough,” even though no one else had an issue.

Throughout the night, he repeatedly corrected or criticized me over small things: asking me to play music, then saying I took too long choosing a song, then complaining that it was too loud.

While we were eating, we were talking about a smart speaker my mom had received. I said out loud to a friend, “I gave my mom a speaker for xmas,” and from two seats away (with our toddler sitting between us), he reached over and hit me on the back of the head. It wasn’t hard enough to injure me, but it was abrupt and shocking (also, embarrassing). Everyone went silent. He said “Santa brought it,” staring at our child. He later minimized it and said I was exaggerating.

A few years ago when I was pregnant we were on a trip, I was nauseous and uncomfortable on a bus. I asked to swap seats with another passenger and did so. My partner was furious because he ended up less comfortable than me and still says I was inconsiderate because when I booked the tour they didn't tell me about what kind of bus we were getting in.

Also pregnant, while helping relocate his elderly mother, I waited for movers in extreme heat and handled most of the logistics, including finding the apartment and paperwork. When a glass went missing from a coffee table, he burst into rage and blamed me. He still holds this against me.

A year ago, my former therapist (whom I was still close to) died by suicide. When I cried and expressed grief, my partner told me I was making it about myself, that she was the one who died, and that I shouldn’t “create a problem out of nothing.”

When I expressed that I'm always fearful of him because I am constantly watching what I'm doing so I won't do anything that bothers him, he took it personal and told me that he didn't deserve to be perceived like that. That he is sweet and caring (admittedly he is, but he does all the other things too) and I was being ungrateful. He threatened to leave and I told him to please stay.

There is so much more but I'm just naming the examples that I have most clarity about.

There’s also almost no sexual intimacy. Not because I don’t want it—I do—but because he regularly rejects me, often with irritation. When I tried to talk about it, he said sex isn’t important to him and that I shouldn’t care either, and he refuses to discuss it further.

After conflicts, he often withdraws emotionally or uses the silent treatment. What’s especially destabilizing is that after very intense confrontations, he can suddenly become sweet and affectionate, acting like nothing happened. That makes me doubt myself all over again.

Right now I feel frozen. I don’t have the energy to leave, but staying feels like I’m disappearing. I’ve just started therapy again after a break, but I still feel disoriented.

My questions are:

I am exaggerating?

Is it possible that I'm being selfish and inconsiderate as he says I am?

Has anyone else felt this kind of numbness and paralysis while still feeling attached?

I’m not looking for validation to leave or stay. I’m looking for clarity, because right now I feel exhausted and unable to trust my own perception.

I've been reading 'why does he do that' and 'too good to leave, too bad to stay' and got some clarity about things but still can't get to a decision.",2,1767787531.0,abusiverelationships,3,1.0,False

1q6dm5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/bmwx7/comments/1q6dm5h/searching_what_is_perfection_of_human_life/,searching what is perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So I’ve been experimenting with my pour-over setup, and I noticed that my morning brews taste way better than the ones I make in the afternoon. I mean, I use the same beans, same grind size, same water temp. Could it be my mood or maybe the water quality? Or is it just that I’m more awake and excited about coffee in the mornings?

1q6dgsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloggersCommunity/comments/1q6dgsj/custom_vending_machines_the_future_of/,Custom Vending Machines: The Future of Personalized Automated Retail,"Custom vending machines are transforming the way businesses sell products and how consumers interact with automated retail. Unlike traditional vending machines that offer a fixed selection of snacks or drinks, custom vending machines are designed to match specific brands, products, locations, and customer needs. From tech gadgets and cosmetics to fresh food and personal care items, these machines combine smart technology, creative design, and data-driven insights to deliver a tailored shopping experience. As consumer expectations shift toward convenience, personalization, and contactless purchasing, custom vending machines are emerging as a powerful solution across multiple industries.

The biggest advantage of [custom vending machines](https://www.kolvending.com/pages/custom) lies in their flexibility. Businesses can customize almost every aspect, including the machine’s size, layout, product capacity, payment methods, and user interface. Touchscreens, digital displays, brand colors, logos, and even interactive animations can be integrated to reflect a company’s identity. This branding turns the vending machine into a mini storefront that operates 24/7 without the costs of staff or traditional retail space. For startups and established brands alike, custom vending machines provide a cost-effective way to test new products, enter new markets, or strengthen brand visibility in high-traffic locations such as malls, airports, universities, hospitals, and office complexes.

Technology plays a central role in making custom vending machines smarter and more efficient. Modern machines can include features such as AI-powered product recommendations, facial recognition for age verification, RFID tracking, and real-time inventory monitoring. Cloud-based management systems allow operators to track sales, restock efficiently, and analyze consumer behavior from anywhere. Cashless payment options such as credit cards, mobile wallets, QR codes, and even cryptocurrency make purchasing seamless and fast. Some advanced machines also support dynamic pricing, promotions, and loyalty programs, enabling brands to engage customers in ways that were once only possible in online retail.

Custom vending machines are also reshaping consumer experience by offering convenience and personalization. Shoppers can access niche or premium products instantly, without waiting in line or interacting with staff. For example, cosmetic brands use customized vending machines with smart mirrors and touchscreens to help customers choose shades or skincare products. Electronics companies sell headphones, power banks, and accessories through secure vending units with anti-theft features. In the food and beverage sector, custom vending machines can dispense fresh meals, salads, smoothies, or specialty coffee while maintaining proper temperature control and hygiene standards. This adaptability makes them suitable for both impulse purchases and essential needs.

Another important benefit of custom vending machines is their role in data-driven decision-making. Every transaction generates valuable data, including purchase time, product popularity, location performance, and customer preferences. Businesses can use this data to optimize product assortments, adjust pricing, plan restocking routes, and improve marketing strategies. Compared to traditional retail, where data collection can be expensive or limited, vending machines offer real-time insights at a much lower operational cost. This is especially valuable for brands looking to scale quickly or operate across multiple cities and countries.

Sustainability and social trends are also influencing the design of custom vending machines. Many manufacturers now offer eco-friendly options such as energy-efficient components, recyclable materials, and smart power management systems. Machines can be customized to support refillable products, reusable packaging, or local and organic goods, aligning with environmentally conscious consumers. Additionally, custom vending machines can serve social purposes, such as distributing hygiene products, personal protective equipment, or essential items in underserved areas. This versatility allows businesses and organizations to combine profit with purpose.

In conclusion, custom vending machines represent a significant evolution in automated retail. They blend branding, technology, convenience, and data into a single, scalable solution that meets modern consumer expectations. Whether used for retail, marketing, food service, or social initiatives, these machines offer unmatched flexibility and efficiency. As technology continues to advance and demand for personalized, contactless shopping grows, custom vending machines are set to play an increasingly important role in the future of retail. Businesses that invest in customized vending solutions today are positioning themselves at the forefront of innovation, ready to meet customers wherever and whenever they choose to buy.",1,1767787006.0,BloggersCommunity,0,1.0,False

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm.enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

A few years ago, I was a student staring at my first intermediate accounting exam, completely lost on journal entries and balance sheets. Late nights, confusion, and too much coffee later, I finally figured it out and ended up loving it. The same thing happened with statistics. Probability and hypothesis testing felt impossible at first, but once it clicked, everything made sense.

Now I have years of experience helping students just like you (or like I used to be) get through tough accounting and statistics assignments. I have worked with university and high school students on financial accounting, managerial accounting, intermediate accounting, auditing, stats, probability, regression, and more.

Whether you are stuck on a homework problem, preparing for an exam, or just need someone to explain a concept clearly, I can help you understand it step by step with no judgment and only clear explanations.

I offer online help anywhere in the world, so you can message me anytime with your question or assignment. I am here to make accounting and statistics less stressful and much easier.

I'm generally a medium roast man. I get my coffee beans delivered from an online company and then are always freshly roasted and all that jazz and I've enjoyed them. 

This week they seem to have introduced some light roasts into the mix and one such roast has just dropped through my door. 

I know light roasts need to be treated different but I'm not sure how to get the best out of them.  I'll share my setup below (since its by no means advanced so I may need some 'tricks' to get the best of these beans).

Smart grinder pro (Sage/Breville)
Bambino 
Bottomless portafilter (not high extraction or anything like that).

My standard medium roast is 18.3g in, ~36g out (hard to be very precise with the lack of solenoid valve on the basic Bambino, to stop dribbling at the end), taking around 25-30 seconds. I use a Wdt and a puck screen.

I generally drink a flat white, but also enjoy a standard shot on its own 

So my question to my more senior coffee nerds... What should I try to get the best out of these beans with the means at my disposal?

Thanks all!

I didn’t notice him at the start but he went out of his way to chit chat with me. He ended up adding me on LinkedIn and messaging me there. Soon he was sending me essays about his life, his past, his family, holidays etc. I was responding, excited to form a bond with someone (i wasn’t sure myself if I wanted it to be romantic, I was depressed & isolating so it felt incredible having someone wanting to talk to me). It got to a point where I was getting multiple screen lengths of messages first thing in the morning, light bickering at work (including coffee runs which was just us bickering & him saying “I love bickering with you”), messages as we drove home (we live close to each other so take the same route), messages when he got home, “I’ll reply when I’m back from my run”, late night essays, then repeat. This went on for 4 weeks. At this point I start dating a guy I’d liked before but quickly cut him off because my bond with this guy was stronger. He always told me he was doing things alone “i went camping”, “i went to America”, “i have a games night every week”, “i went on a wine tour with a tour group”, “i have a friend who comes around to take care of my dog when im at work”. 4 weeks later, it was my birthday and I just had the urge to self sabotage. “Did you move to this city alone or with friends or a partner?”. He says “with a partner”. My jaw was on the floor. I knew everything about this guy. Except this. I asked about his partner, changing the tone to pretend I was being friendly all along (after all, I have always been guarded with my feelings and establish a friendship first before diving in so it didn’t hurt too much). He glazed over a lot of the questions so I sympathised, assuming I was intruding on what was possibly a rough patch, since he loved sharing information otherwise. Our conversations continued, he was mildly flirty, I wasn’t but I didn’t stop him either. He was back to referring to himself singular. I assumed they had broken up and he didn’t wanna talk about it. He changed his Instagram photo from both of them to just him (but we were still only talking on LinkedIn). He seemed to relate a lot to my singleness and urge to do a lot of things solo. I have been single for 4 years, barely dated and it might just be in my head, but it felt like he liked that about me

Weeks go by and I was meant to go for a day festival with a couple of friends. He was curious about it. A friend cancelled the night before, so I told him about it. He replied within seconds. Pres were at mine. My other friend was driving so didn’t drink much. John rocked up with beers and wine, left his stuff at mine including the wine saying we could have it later. I didn’t think much of it. At the festival, him and I decide to take a cap. I don’t remember the first hour, but when I clocked back in, he was lightly holding me (felt platonic) because I kept swaying and falling. We danced and had a great night, all of us. John kept talking about the wine we could have at home. I wasn’t sure, as I was coming down at this point. My friend drove us home, and John got off with me, talking about the wine again. I get home and crash on the couch. He references the wine again, I say I’ll be up for it after a little lie down. We then finish the bottle between us. There was a lot of eye contact from him, yes I loved it but I kept breaking it because I wanted to ask him what our deal was but was too scared. We were desperate for more drinks but ran out, he was craving cigarettes and I had an unopened box gifted to me so we went outside every 30 or so minutes to smoke. He’d start every smoke with “you look so cold, come here” and chuck his arm around me and rub my leg. I thought it was a little odd, but not enough to call out. It felt nice and I went with it. He then suggested a movie. I don’t have a TV, so I asked him to bring the laptop to the living room. He said the living room was too cold, and the bedroom was warmer so he suggested going there. There’s still a lot of eye contact but I’m still acting awkward. He keeps asking me if I’m alright, telling me I’m quiet. I wanted it, but I wasn’t sure I was reading it right and I didn’t know if he was single, yet I felt like I was intruding by asking. I could have sworn I’d once seen his gf on his lock screen. But I don’t know if I’d imagined it. We’re watching the movie, I’m keeping a clear distance between us and my eyes on the screen. He leaves the room for a bit, I assume to go to the toilet, and I go to the kitchen in the dark for my supplements. I see him standing outside the balcony on the phone. He sees me in the kitchen and comes back in, asking me what I’m doing. Usually he’s chatty and tells me who was on the phone, what they spoke about etc. nothing 

6 hours pass, and he says he should probably leave but was really tired (we had work the next morning). I said he could nap or sleep at mine if he was tired but could also just go home if he wanted to. He was umm-ing and ah-ing, saying “I can’t…I’ve got a dog in the backyard waiting to be let in…I’ve got work tomorrow…I’ve got a dog…you know I can’t, I’ve got a dog”. I say “you should go home then. You’ve got the option if you wanna stay”. He falls asleep immediately after, reaches out mid sleep holding my hand. I pull away, and he does it again. We had an hour before our alarms went off. His phone rang but he was so deep in sleep he didn’t wake up. The next morning I called in sick. He said he had to go, then ran home. In my hoodie. 

At the festival, we finally exchanged numbers (no Instagram still). He texted me heaps the next morning, then popped by with sweet treats and electrolytes, left immediately after. We spoke about that night heaps, wanting to do it again. He commented on my quietness and awkwardness again. I didn’t have the balls to explain it. 

I went away on holidays shortly after, and after a week, our conversations died, after 3 months of daily texting. I came back and stalked his Instagram (we don’t follow each other). He had been tagged in several photos with his partner. They seem so happy. They’ve got a big friend group they seem to frequently do things with - games nights, wine tours, everything he told me he did alone. I really want to ask him to just explain what that was. But I’m scared he’ll deny it. Or tell me it was in my head. Or just won’t reply (hes not talking to me now). I’m so grossed out by him and myself right now. I only want confirmation of what that was so 1. He can realise he’s not as nice a guy as he says and acts like, 2. I can get over this conspiracy that no one ever values me as a person 3.

Did anyone go through the full certification process in the EU (LVD + EMC tests + technical file etc.)?

1q6d5lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/1q6d5lw/my_experience_as_a_tourist_in_uganda/,My experience as a tourist in Uganda.,"Hello everyone !

I am from Nepal and travelled to Uganda for 12 days last month. The only thing I regret was not staying for more days. Here are some of the key observations from my limited time in the country.

We mostly stayed in Entebbe for the first week. Explored gardens, malls, cafes and restaurants around the beach area. We then hired a taxi and went to Jinja for 2 days. Went to Kampala for 1 day and stayed at Murchison falls national park for 3 days.

First impression  : The country is REDD, and there are petrol pumps everywhere.

Weather : The best thing about the country is the weather. We have a similar weather during the month of September and October, and its the best time of the year for me. 

People : From my encounters, the people were very kind and friendly towards us. Most of the people were very jolly and living in the moment. We had 3 different drivers who drove us around the above mentioned places. They were very friendly and professional. The hotel staffs were very extremely friendly. However, at the airport, I felt that the airline people stationed at the airport had a different bias towards white tourists. 

Highways : We travelled by road when in Uganda. The drive to Murchison falls took like 6 hours or so. The highways were really good, but, the inner roads were actually very bad. 

Nature : Uganda has an amazing nature especially the safari region. We went on safari for 3 days and I simply loved every moment of it.

Food : We did not explicitly eat the local food since all the places we stayed at had breakfast, lunch and dinner, and most of the time the dishes were continental. Though our drivers suggested us some food on all our road trip. I will say that the foods I ate were mid, let's say 6/10. But you have to keep in mind that nepali food is a fusion of tibetian and Indian foods mostly, so the bar when it comes to food is already high for us.

Safety : Since it was my first time in Africa, I didnt know what to expect. Overall, we felt very safe everywhere and at all times. Our drivers though did warn us not show phones outside especially around the outskirts of Kampala.

Transportation : The only thing that could have been better from a tourist pov is the transportation.  Maybe i was not aware about ride sharing apps in the country, but the lack of it was a concern. We have numerous ride apps offering both fourwheeler and two wheeler services. Boda bodas are risky, though a similar two wheel transportation is common in nepal, I feel like ours is  organised and safe considering the mandatory use of helmets and limitations to one passenger only.

I initially thought that Uganda would be like a village or smth. And to no surprise, my driver thought that Nepal is like a village as well lol. We both were surprised, i had shown him my dashcam videos of Kathmandu ( capital of Nepal). Kampala is exactly like Kathmandu, populated, polluted and chaotic. I would compare Entebbe to Pokhara ( a touristy city in Nepal). From economy perspective both countries are similar. Socially, I felt that both countries are a little laid back and relaxed.

Overall my vacation in Uganda was 9/10. I think if I make a lot more money, I would retire in Entebbe just like the numerous Canadians I saw during my visit.

Edit : Entebbe lacked cafes. As a coffee enthusiast, I wanted to see some cozy cafes aimed and servicing explicitly coffee. Considering that Uganda is a major producer of coffee, I was surprised that I didnt not see a lot of it.",8,1767785992.0,Uganda,5,1.0,False

Sound familiar? While the wiki itself has existed since May 2025, it previously only functioned as a resource library and a home to frequently asked questions. Both of those topics have been seen as invaluable and are remaining in place and will continue to be updated, but we've now also expanded to a full blown wiki!

Whether you want to know where [Nothing's Kiosk](https://nothing.wiki/kiosk) has appeared around the world, how the [Community Edition](https://nothing.wiki/community-edition) came to life, or when the [Glyph Mirror](https://nothing.wiki/glyph-mirror) became a thing, now you can easily find all of the information in one place.

Why a wiki? A wiki helps to preserve an accurate history of Nothing and its projects based on facts, without getting lost in the sea of rumours and opinions. With all the facts hosted on one site, you can easily look up something you're interested in or learn more about the company to better understand their thoughts and direction.

The wiki is live now! You can find it at [https://nothing.wiki](https://nothing.wiki).

1q6d05s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Silver-Method5403/comments/1q6d05s/taking_back_the_extotally_confused/,Taking back the Ex…totally confused,"Hi all, firstly I’d like to say I’m grateful for any advice or insight, as I’ve spoken to friends but sometimes it can be difficult (unconscious bias and all that)

So, the situation is that I dated a guy last year for just over 5 months, and things did really hit off well, we were talking everyday, talking about the future, making plans, and I fell pretty hard for him. He had already told me he loved me at about the 2 month mark and I told him about 3 months in and I felt like, yes, this is someone I can see myself being with for the long term. I genuinely cared about him and was talking about introducing to my family (which for me is a big deal).

Then things took a turn to the left; some arguing, disagreements etc, usual couple stuff but then eventually, there started to be this drifting apart; plans to meet were being cancelled, texts were drying up. I know that he was going through a stressful time with his job and also finishing his masters degree. he asked for space and I gave it to him. when he came back after a week no contact, we were texting but it was very basic. And it was usually me initiating the conversation. in the end I felt like, if I didn’t text then I wouldn’t hear from him. So I didn’t and the conversation died. And 5 months later, I still hadn’t heard from him. I assumed it was over, that he’d blocked me (as this was something he once threatened me with before). It hurt a lot, and I was left feeling abandoned. I wanted to reach out but I really felt like if he had wanted to speak to me, then he would have done so. I also felt that by not messaging him, perhaps I was just as bad. And that he would be mad at me for contacting him out of the blue suddenly. Anyway, regardless of that, I tried to move on, I had my own stuff going on as I’m studying too and I did date again although it was more just to try and move on and forget about him. I still thought about him though and wondered if he was ok. I often found myself getting upset at times where I missed him.

So then, New Years came, I was sending a basic New Year message to my contacts, and OK, maybe it was stupid, but I saw his name and thought fuck it, I’ll send to him. I honestly wasn’t expecting a response and was like 90% sure I was blocked anyway. And I figured well then I can just leave him in 2025 and finally move on (yeah, I know 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️) I heard back from him 3 days later and we had a conversation. He explained his absence and was convinced that I was mad at him and he was scared to message. I told him that I had missed him and that he really hurt me. He apologised several times and wanted to meet to talk in person. So, the next day we met, we had coffee, it was like old times. We always had felt comfortable around eachother from the get go. He told me that he had been going through mental health issues, that he was so unhappy with his life-had suicidal thoughts etc and that I was one of the few good things in his life but that he didnt want to drag me into his drama and negativity. He needed time to work on himself, which he is doing and I am pleased for him. He’s changed his job, he moved to a new place and cut ties with certain toxic friends. I told him that I would have helped him through it but he didn’t want to burden me and didn’t want saving-he felt it was something he had to do by himself.  

So, he wants to continue seeing me. And this is where I get confused. I’m trying to protect myself from getting hurt again. But at the same time I feel like I can’t let go. I really do care about him and maybe it’s silly of me to do that, maybe he doesn’t deserve it. The thing that hurts me the most is that, he was perfectly ok to not have me in his life for that period of time. Like I didn’t even matter. And now i’m like, is he only reaching out because nobody else is interested in him at this point? (he swears that he hasnt been with anyone since me-not that it would matter to me) And then I also think, did I do the wrong thing in not contacting him either? That I should have gotten in contact with him sooner and not left it so long so does that make me just as bad? 

So now I’m wondering what to do.  On the plus side, he has apologised and taken responsibility, although I‘m not really sure he understands just how much I was hurt by it. My gut is telling me to take things REALLY slow in order to protect myself. He seems to be in a better place mentally and working towards that, and I do really care about him and I also don’t want to disrupt that or complicate things. Or am I just overthinking it? I’m aware that neither of us is perfect in this scenario. I‘m curious to know if anyone has experienced similar, have you had any success with getting back together with an ex and what your experiences were and any advice you’d give to someone in my shoes. Like where to go from here? Grateful for any feedback.



P.S. pls dont virtually slap me for sending the new year text 😂🤦🏻‍♂️

* Met on holiday, connected over upbringing, creativity, ideas, books we read etc. 
* We made out, she said she really liked me, not felt like this so soon before.
* I initially was seeing someone so she messaged saying she's not normally like this, a good girl really and we should just be friends. 
* Two-weeks silence followed by music event and admission of not stop thinking about me, cried etc. 
* Stay the night, light play, kissing, says ""you're going to break my heart""
* I arrange date - we text more and call about interests (art, poetry, ideas, etc.)
* 3 days silence post call, followed by ringing me at 1am over the weekend (Halloween)
* she texts two days later apologising (she's a bit sheepish). I remain calm, confirm date logistics. 
* Date arrives, immediately she takes photos of me spontaneously on her camera at the art gallery.
* We flight and connect. We go for dinner and drinks - she says ""I've been trying to do things to take my mind off you lately. I thought it was working til I saw you""
* She stays with me at my airbnb. 
* We have a bath together
* We have sex multiple times
* She cuddles into me, tells me she wants a postcard and poem from me
* Then says she's an awful person, she's crossed a moral line because I was seeing someone.
* I tried to suggest meeting in couple weeks - she says she can't, but lets book another music event with the group. I say 6th Dec
* Pulls back for 6 days of silence
* Then texts ""Wish you were at \[music event\]. I reply ""you know I do too"", she replies ""ahhh""
* Silence for 2 days
* Postcard and poem lands - she sends texts ""so thoughtful/words are lovely/I was speechless/you're very special""
* Eventually, two single word replies. I leave it for two weeks.
* Dec 6th - they come to music event but plan to be sober.
* We keep our distance - she says I'm being grumpy. I wasn't.
* She eventually decides to not do it sober.
* I tell her i've been single for a while. Her face lights up and she melts into me physically again
* We go back to my airbnb as a group. She says ""did you not bring me a t shirt?""
* She comes down in my t shirt and boxers. 
* We go to bed, she tells me all the things she likes about me: 
   * the familiarity of my aftershave, the notes she gets from it
   * My smile and dimples she can't resist
   * The way my lips feel.
* We have sex again. This time after she says ""I'm going to break your heart."" 
* Next day we go for coffee. She says we should also date other people. I say cool. She leans on my shoulder, holds my hand. 
* Next day likes my instagram post and so does my ex. She freaks out, leaves all our group chats and asks for call
* She admits catching feelings, and says ""I know I said we should date other people, but I am not just some fling"".
* I reassure her. Tell her I have feelings for her too.
* She said we probs need another call.
* 5 days silence
* Texts apologising, doesn't know what to say, but doesn't want it to end like this.
* I call her - ask her if she wants it to end. She says ""no that's not what it is"" / ""I'm not very good at ending things anyway""
* Asks when I am next in her city. 
* I am in her city, her friend tells her... she texts me quite a bit, randomly calls me, high energy.
* Says we should do a group padel sesh. I ask about going theatre together. She says she can't, gets flustered and we end the call.
* She texts hot still, sending photos of her and her friend ice-skating
* She says ""I didn't know you were here, where are you staying? I reply the next morning. She says ""are you still here?"" I say no, gone home and the thread goes colder. 
* I'm back in her city for Xmas - I tell her, but she can't find time. 
* I lay cards: I say I do think there's something here between us and I'd like to have more fun with her in the NY
* She agrees there's a spark, that it's been wild and she's enjoyed getting to know me. She says she thinks we need to figure things out at our own pace.
* We agree a low-pressure coffee in the NY
* After, she starts texting hot again. Long paragraphs, asking me lots of questions, sending me her art and asking my opinions, complimenting my writing and saying she can hear my voice when she reads it.
* Texting continues like this into the New Year. 
* However, now, I haven't heard from her for 4 days.
* I am about to move to her city (capital city of our country) on Jan 10th (she knows this)
* Could be anticipating me asking for that coffee.

Guess I just want some thoughts and opinions on whether this is avoidant or just games. I've noticed a pattern:

1. Holiday intimacy/guilt - 2 week pullback
2. Post-music event/date - 3 day pullback
3. Post-art gallery date/sex - 6 day pullback
4. Postcard & poem - 2 week pullback
5. Post admitting feelings - 5 day pullback
6. My move, coffee date reality - 4 days (so far)

I'm not intense, I've merely let her lead the emotional and physical intimacy, while staying anchored and grounded. I'm a secure(ish) guy, just being conscious of words vs behaviour and patterns.

Debut shave with Barrister and Mann’s Leviathan. I’ve caught cold and my nose is clogged so couldn’t grasp much regarding the scent profile of the soap. But… the coffee note was very prominent and that’s the only note I caught off the soap with a cold stricken nose hahahah. B&M’s lather never disappoints. It sure is water hungry and I’m always amazed by the water holding capacity of B&Ms. No matter how much water I sprayed with the mist sprayer, the lather never felt like drippy or runny, not even remotely. 

I went with Feather today, the blade I started my Wetshaving journey with. I love the bite of this blade, hence I was very cautious with my technique and the pressure I was applying with the Rocca. I really loved the feedback. It mowed down 4 day growth with ease. A couple of weepers but not an issue at all I’ve handled worse while operating with a feather hahahaha. I’d also like to say that feather always demands respect and a bit of a refined technique while shaving.

We’ve been friends since college, and she’s the type who talks in a lot of therapy words, like “boundaries” and “holding space” and “accountability”. I’m not mad at that in general, I’ve done therapy too, but sometimes it feels like she uses it to win arguments. Anyway, last weekend a few of us met up for drinks and she crashed at my place because it was late. In the morning I was making coffee and she was sitting at my kitchen table scrolling on her phone. Mine was on the counter. I went to the bathroom for like two minutes and when I came back she had my phone in her hands, screen unlocked. She jumped a little and said, “Oh, I just needed to check something.” I asked what, and she said she was “making sure I was safe” because I’ve been “not myself lately.” I’ve had a rough couple months, work stress, insomnia, I’ve been more quiet, but I’m not like, a danger to myself. She then admitted she looked through my texts with my sister and my recent calls, and she also opened my photo roll. She said she was looking for “signs” I was spiraling, and that she had “a duty” as my friend to intervene. I felt my stomach drop. I asked how she unlocked it and she said she saw me type my passcode “a while ago” and remembered it. That made it worse, like she stored it away for this exact moment.



I told her to give it back and she got defensive, saying I was “reacting from trauma” and she wasn’t judging me, she was being caring. I said caring would be asking me if I’m okay, not going through my private stuff like I’m a child. She kept insisting it was “not a violation” because she “didn’t share anything” and she’s “a safe person.” She also said if I have nothing to hide, it shouldnt be a big deal. That line made me see red. I told her to leave, and she started crying and saying I’m abandoning her and “punishing” her for caring. After she left, I changed my passcode, and then she texted me from her phone saying she’s sorry I “perceived” it as invasive, but she stands by her intentions. I haven’t replied. Our mutual friends say I’m being harsh and that she was worried about me, but I feel sick thinking about her scrolling through my life like that. AITJ for basically cutting her off over this?



TL;DR: My friend unlocked my phone and went through texts/calls/photos to “check on me” without asking. I kicked her out and stopped responding. AITJ?

I have been taking Zoloft for a month now and I recently started Pramistar (sort of a potent Piracetam). Yesterday, I forgot to eat, drank two coffees, and my nervous system just went completely haywire. I had a crisis that lasted about 40 minutes and it was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. It felt like being on the worst drugs possible—I felt like I wasn't ""me"" anymore.

I struggled to breathe so hard I wanted to call an ambulance, but I was so paranoid and freaked out that my head made me think I was going to die if the situation around me got more agitated—like the ""light in my head"" was going to explode. I had clear blackouts and memory gaps where I wasn't fully conscious of my actions. At one point, I felt like I had no senses left, completely detached from reality and terrified of everything.

During the peak, I started to dress myself while mumbling and talking to myself. I had weird motor tics and was moving my hands in a dubious way because the muscles inside were hurting so badly. I was stuttering, speaking in a very staccato, broken way, and I would casually start crying and then stop myself abruptly. Sometimes I was present, but most of the time I was fighting just to keep a shred of control.

Anyway, the peak stopped after an hour and I went to psychiatric emergencies. Conclusion: I am stopping the coffee and the Pramistar immediately. Today is the second day and I am still incredibly sore and weak. I have been shivering and my muscles ache like I’ve been through physical trauma.

Last month I tested 44 AI tools. Spent $847 of my own money. Wasted 60+ hours.



Here's the brutal truth nobody's talking about:



THE TRASH TIER (41 tools):

Most AI tools are ChatGPT wrappers with a fancy UI charging $29/month. They do ONE thing ChatGPT already does for free, but worse.



THE GAME CHANGERS (3 tools):



1. \*\*Perplexity Pro\*\* ($20/month)

\- Replaces Google for research

\- Cites actual sources (ChatGPT hallucinates)

\- Saved me 15 hours/week on fact-checking



2. \*\*Claude Sonnet (via API)\*\* ($0.02/request avg)

\- Better writing than ChatGPT for anything over 500 words

\- Understands context without 10 re-prompts

\- Costs less than a coffee/month



3. \*\*Notion AI\*\* ($10/month add-on)

\- Only AI that actually integrates into my workflow

\- Not standalone = no context switching

\- Writes meeting notes while I'm still in the meeting



THE PATTERN I NOTICED:

The best AI tools either:

\- Do ONE thing 10x better than ChatGPT (Perplexity)

\- Cost nearly nothing (Claude API)

\- Live inside tools you already use (Notion)



Everything else? Disposable.



What's YOUR experience? Am I missing something obvious?

See when you actually love someone and want to see them be a better human... Bc they've cried to you about it and to call them on their bullshit...you not only do it through actions(i.e. the Nate,Julz,Jup, house to apartment situations) but also through words. Actual talking.

1q6cgiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1q6cgiq/quitting_caffeine_6_days_in/,"Quitting Caffeine, 6 days in","I'm quitting mostly because I have IBS. I'm a habitual coffee drinker but It's always been both friend and enemy to me. It triggers diarrhea and pain but at the same time it helps me power through the pain. For me it's poison and medicine in one cup.

I have quit in the past and felt so much better but then I've always gone back because the first cup of coffee after a month off feels amazing and at first I can have just one cup on Saturday morning. But it quickly falls back into an every day habit.

The first couple of days without coffee I drank one cup of black tea because for me that's gentler than coffee on my intestines while still giving me the caffeine buzz.

I spent the first 3 days of withdrawal on the couch over the weekend after New year's day. I took Friday off work. I had no energy and I gave myself permission to just do nothing at all. 

I've had 2 days back at work and luckily it's a fairly slow week for me, no big deadlines. I struggled  a bit to get through the day with some headaches but nothing too debilitating. For me the first 3 days were the worst of it.

Tonight I fell asleep right after dinner and now I'm up at 3am. But to be fair I had bad sleep while on caffeine too.

My intestines are already feeling and functioning a lot better. I think if I don't start the day by triggering my IBS it will give me a little more leeway in my diet for the rest of the day. 

I'm hoping in by next week I'll have some energy and be sleeping like a normal person!

Why isn't there a push for testing vitamin/nutrient deficiencies?,"34/M, formally diagnosed with ADHD-I in July 2025 via RTC/PUK.

Over the last few months, I've been facing absolutely immense fatigue. I'm talking 2-3 coffees a day, with a good night of sleep, decent nutrition, a lot of water, exercise, and still completely exhausted. I appreciate I'm not as young as I used to be, but I felt like surely this can't just be it?

Years ago I had blood tests done when I lived on the south coast, as I had a few overlapping symptoms. It turns out I had low folic acid levels, and I had just remembered this recently. Symptoms were the same, including frequent mouth ulcers, thinning hair, and pale with no energy. 

I've started supplementing it again at 400ug, and a lot has improved already within the last few days. The ulcers completely disappeared immediately, my memory and focus are a bit better, and my energy levels have skyrocketed, to the point that I'm actually having to knock myself out at night with a magnesium tablet and chamomile tea, because I'm still feeling fairly wired from the Folic Acid and coffee that morning.

I'm sure it'll likely 'level out' in the coming weeks after what's likely been an extreme deficiency, but I'll take this as a win for the moment, especially on the lengthy road to titration, which I believe doesn't even start for another 6+ months for myself.

The point of this post isn't to push a product, or even suggest this supplement, but it's made me wonder, when resources are so limited currently for helping ADHD folks in the UK, why isn't there more of a push for testing vitamin/nutrient deficiencies, in the run up to medication etc? 

I am by no means 'healed', but this is an example of a supplement (from something we're all meant to have) is helping somewhat, instead of being solely reliant on medication (though I am both hopeful and excited for when this happens).

I've read a few things over the last few months, saying that ADHD folks can be prone to deficiencies, which in turn create a negative feedback loop of worsening symptoms, and then trying to gloss over them with other workarounds like caffeine etc. 

Would it not make sense to test people for deficiencies, to help them as much as possible before medication?

Thanks!

Kind of embarrassed about what I just did. It felt like this was not who I am, that I dont deserve to be doing stuff like this. 

Maybe its the reason that since years I got my ups with motivation and tryng to better myself followed by downs in which I barely do the minimum and just vegetate around. So when I finally have the motivation to do something productive again and try to improve myself I immediatly start to think that this wont last and that what Im doing will not have any significant effect on my life long term and is just a performative act to hide that sooner or later I will be in the same hole I was in so often before.

It could also be that whenever I try to be better, I feel scared that if I really try to be better and Im still failing, I actually have to accept what my I myself and my life are at the moment and will be in the future.

Also on a sidenote, whenever I wake up in the morning, for the first 30 minutes after, I feel very depressed and anxious. This mostly fades away within 2 hours, but its something that really uses up a lot of energy to get through every day. I tried drinking coffee as soon as I wake up, Im taking magnesium, vitamin D, all supplements that could help with that, but it doesnt seem to change anything.

If anyone has some advice to share on these two things I would be really really thankful.

I hope you have a good day and i wish you all the best for 2026!",2,1767783017.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Not sure if this is the type of content that is allowed here but it’s worth a shot to get some answers!

I’ve been in the same job for about 5 months now. It’s a typical office job Monday to Friday 9ish-5 or 6ish. I get on okay and seem to be getting more and more knowledgeable as the weeks go on. I feel comfortable working there and get on well with my colleagues.

However, when I’m pulling up to work, my stomach instantly starts really hurting. It will hurt from then until about 2-3pm.

My question is why? 

I’m doing well and I don’t feel nervous about going to work. I’ve got no reason to be anxious but for some reason my stomach only starts really hurting when I get to work. To the point I’m holding back tears because it’s so painful. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Is there anything I can do to help? Is it something I should be going to the doctors for? Could it be a mental thing? Could it be stress? I have so many questions none of which I have answers for, so I’m coming to you guys to see if you have any for me.

Edit to add: 

it only hurts on the weekdays. Weekends it doesn’t hurt at all. I tend to wake up a little later on the weekends but no problems once I’m awake. 

Food wise, I typically eat some cereal with milk or maybe some toast with butter. I have either a coffee, tea, or just a glass of water with my breakfast. Normal breakfast stuff really. ",1,1767782810.0,work,3,1.0,False

1q6c89c,https://www.reddit.com/r/JudgeMyAccent/comments/1q6c89c/why_focus_on_accent/,Why focus on accent?,"There is a strange tendency here in r/JudgeMyAccent  to focus on perferct accent. Well, I know that this is the name of the subreddit, but in my head the order to learn should be the following.



1. Morphemes and pronunciation



2. Idiomatic expressions and grammar

  
999. Perfect accent

  
Example 1) Lots of people asking this in subreddit are hard to understand because they are swallowing consonant clusters (often Chinese or Asian, or just sloppy English born people). They often have very good vowels and prosody. Why bother with accent if a listener has a hard time figuring out what is said?

  
Example 2) A workmate from Italy didn't hear nor reproduce the minimal pair leave-live. Who cares? This is just cute in comparison with swallowing consonant clusters and messed up grammar.

  
Example 3) A coffee shop owner in my town (Sweden, my language) has an accent (but a rich vocabulary). Should he prioritize work on that? NO! Definitely not since he misses the basic grammatical V2 rule all the time and says ""Förra året vi sålde restaurangen."" Bang! Go fix that first. Missing that is bad. Very bad!

  
Example 4) Me. You can hear that I come from Scandinavia after 10 seconds. I sound like a caricature of the female cop in Fargo. Should I work on that? Not really. I have had to adapt a few expressions when in California, but so would a Yorkshire farmer have to do. Is my English good? No! I sometimes miss the correct pronunciation of words like ""hibernate"" that I have learnt by reading them. And I can still miss a singular third person verb -s as well as the order of adjectives. And I do not understand every word in the newspaper. I know I have work to do. But I won't work on accent, since I am much easier to understand than a Glaswegian and I don't care if you can guess where I am from and that is not what it is about. 



Isn't perfect accent long way down the list after ""phoneme placement"", ""prosody"", ""easy to comprehend"" and ""idiomatic grammar and expressions"" in order to fit into a society? What I mean is that there are two questions confused by a lot of people in this subreddit: ""guess where I come from"" and ""what should I do to improve my English"". Those are very, very different questions.

1q6c768,https://i.redd.it/xnpfp8abpwbg1.png,"Sorry, I'm Mated To The Commander","""Can you believe it? The Sullivans' real daughter, the one who went missing ten years ago, has finally been found,"" one lady whispered.

""Goodness, that's wonderful. But what will become of the girl they adopted?"" another lady replied, her voice full of concern.

""Oh, that's not all. I've heard that the long-lost heiress and the adopted daughter's fiancé got very close during his rut,"" the first lady added, her tone dropping even lower.

""If I were in her shoes, I don't think I could bear to stay under the same roof another day,"" the second lady murmured, shaking her head.

A stunning young woman with long hair stood by the window, rubbing her throbbing temples. She frowned slightly. 'Strange, I did drink a lot last night, but it shouldn't have knocked me out that completely.'

The low whispers drifting in from outside caught her attention. Recognizing the gossip was about her, she let out a self-deprecating laugh.

Ten years ago, Xanthe Sullivan, the beloved daughter of the noble Sullivan family on Alpha Prime, went missing in a spaceship crash.

The Sullivan family was heartbroken. Later, they adopted a little girl named Layla from the Wastelands-9 Orphan Core, who looked a bit like Xanthe and was about the same age. They renamed the girl Layla Sullivan.

A decade later, Xanthe was found. Of course, the Sullivan family was overjoyed. They poured all their love onto Xanthe, buying her favorite clothes, jewelry, as well as the latest optical computers and aero-vehicles.

They even made Layla move out of her house, all because Xanthe had remarked one day, ""Layla's house is so pretty.""

The Sullivan family spared no effort in spoiling Xanthe. None of this came as a surprise to Layla. After all, she was only adopted, while Xanthe was the family's real daughter.

Layla moved out quietly and tried her best to be kind to Xanthe. What she never imagined, however, was that her own fiancé had spent his rut with Xanthe.

Shaking off the thought, Layla let out a slow yawn and turned to pack her things. She was leaving for Imperial Academy. 'It's time to leave the Sullivans anyway,' she told herself.

Packing didn't take long. She had little to bring, and wanted nothing from the Sullivan family. She put on her white and blue freshman uniform, tucking the cuffs into her black boots. Looking into the mirror, she tied her hair into a neat ponytail.

The only thing left was her optical computer, a birthday gift from her eldest brother Nolan Sullivan two years ago. Nolan had always been kind to her. He'd been stationed on an alien planet supervising energy operations and hadn't been home in half a year.

But Layla knew that even Nolan would surely dote on Xanthe more. She decided to format the optical computer, wiping all her data clean, before returning it to the Sullivans for good.

Just as she was about to format the computer, a notification from Prime AI flashed. \[Ms. Layla Sullivan, your Genetic Pairing Program application has been received. Data processing in progress. Genetic comparison ongoing.\]

Layla froze, her fingers going numb. The watch-like optical computer slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a sharp clatter.

On Alpha Prime, there were two ways to marry. The first was free love and marriage, chosen by most. The second was the Genetic Pairing Program.

Once one applied, Prime AI would compare their genes with every eligible unmarried person on the planet. The highest match led to an automatic marriage. In short, it was like asking Prime AI to assign a spouse.

But this second option had mostly fallen out of use. It was seen as cold and impersonal, often leading to unhappy marriages. Almost no one chose it anymore.

A cold glint flashed in Layla's eyes. 'Who got into my optical computer and submitted that application?' She walked straight out and called for the robot butler. ""Who entered my room last night?""

The robot butler's electronic eyes flickered. Without another word, Layla reached over and accessed its central control system, pulling up the surveillance feed from the night before, during which she had been drunk and sound asleep.

The records had been deleted, but recovering the data was no trouble for Layla. Within minutes, the restored footage showed a figure slipping into her room.

It was Xanthe. What's more, the footage also clearly showed that last night, Xanthe had furtively put something into Layla's drink.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Sullivan kitchen was spacious. Most of their meals were handled by household robots, but this morning, Xanthe was bustling around. She was in a white dress, her curly hair pulled back, with a pink apron tied over her dress.

She looked at her mother Harper Sullivan, who stood nearby, and said, ""Mom, the oatmeal I made probably isn't as perfect as the robot's.""

Harper, a gentle-looking lady, looked at Xanthe with tender eyes. ""Nothing tastes better than the oatmeal my daughter makes herself.""

Xanthe smiled, about to reply when hurried footsteps cut through the quiet kitchen. Before she could turn fully, Layla walked straight up and slapped her hard across the face.

Xanthe covered her cheek, tears instantly filling her eyes. ""Layla, why did you slap me?"" She looked so hurt and fragile that anyone watching would have felt sorry for her.

Harper's eyes reddened. She pulled Xanthe into a protective hug and glared at Layla. ""Layla, what has gotten into you? How could you slap Xanthe like that?""

""Ask Xanthe what she did to my optical computer last night,"" Layla replied, her voice icy and flat.

""That still doesn't give you the right to slap her, no matter what she might have done,"" Harper shot back, holding Xanthe closer.

A cold smile twisted Layla's lips. ""What if I told you she used my optical computer to apply for the Genetic Pairing Program in my name?""

Harper froze. She turned to look at Xanthe in her arms. Xanthe's tears fell freely down. ""Mom, I didn't mean to. I just wanted to download some study materials from her optical computer.

""You know Layla got into Imperial Academy, but I never had the chance to learn properly when I was gone. I wanted to study hard this year and try the exam next time.

""She was drunk and asleep last night. I didn't want to disturb her, so I tried to get the files myself. I must have pressed something wrong and sent off some kind of application by mistake. I would never do this on purpose, I swear.""

The more Harper listened, the more her heart ached. 'My poor daughter suffered so much out there alone.' And the thought of it, as always, filled her with a sharp pang of guilt.

She turned back to Layla, her expression stern. ""Layla, no matter what, Xanthe didn't mean it. If you're unhappy with the match they give you, we will cover all the costs for an annulment.""

Layla looked at the lady who had once been so kind to her, now speaking of her forced marriage as if it were nothing. A deep chill settled in her chest.

""Do you know what else she did last night?"" Layla's voice was low and steady. ""She slipped into the kitchen and put something in my drink.

""Then she sneaked into my room and used my optical computer to submit that application. She just wants me to leave this house for good.""

Harper looked shocked, her face losing its color. ""That's impossible,"" she said, her voice tight. She refused to believe her own daughter could do something so low.

Layla's tone remained calm. ""Believe what you want. I've already sent all the surveillance footage to your email.""

Harper looked at her sobbing daughter. After a heavy pause, she spoke with pained reluctance. ""Layla, Xanthe couldn't have meant any real harm. Can you forgive her?

""You know how much she suffered out there. And I raised you for ten years. Can't those ten years of care count for something? Can't they make you a little more understanding toward her?""

Each word felt like a needle. The sharper the pain grew inside Layla, the quieter she became. ""Mrs. Sullivan, I do remember those ten years. You spent 168,000 starcoins on me. I will pay back every last one."" With that, she turned to go.

Harper finally registered what Layla had called her. She froze where she stood. ""Layla, you called me Mrs. Sullivan. Are you really ending everything between us over something like this?""

Xanthe looked up and saw the conflict and sorrow in her mother's eyes. She suddenly began to sob even louder. ""It's all my fault. Layla, you must still be angry about Caleb and me.

""If you're upset, just blame me. But please, Layla, the Sullivans raised you for ten years. How can you be so cold? You're going to break Mom and Dad's hearts.""

Layla turned around and saw the tears welling in Harper's eyes. A bitter realization washed over her. 'From beginning to end, I was the only villain. With Xanthe here, my life would never be as peaceful as before. If they want to spoil her rotten, fine. I'll leave.'

Right then, a soft beep came from her optical computer. She glanced down and found the marriage application had been approved. Without a word, she formatted the device and dropped it onto the floor. Then she turned and walked toward the door.

""Layla, where are you going?"" Harper called out, her voice trembling. No matter what, she had still raised Layla for ten years, and that kind of bond wasn't easy to simply let go of.

Layla waved a hand over her shoulder without turning around. ""To the Central Nexus,"" she replied, her tone flat. ""Going to collect my husband.""

Chapter 2 Do You Like My Pheromones?

The Central Nexus of Alpha Prime was located at the heart of Prime City, handling nearly all the daily affairs of the planet's residents. Civil marriage matters were processed on the 14th floor of the Central Tower.

Layla took a public aero-vehicle to the Central Nexus and entered through the iris scanner. As soon as she stepped inside, a polished man in silver uniform and glasses approached her. ""Are you Ms. Layla Sullivan?"" the man asked.

Layla nodded. The man went on, ""Please follow me to the VIP lounge. Your genetic match is already waiting.""

""Thank you, please lead the way,"" Layla said. She had no plan to go through with a forced marriage. She intended to explain clearly to her match that she hadn't filed the application herself.

Besides, now that she'd cut ties with the Sullivans, she was broke. She was sure her match wouldn't want someone with nothing to offer. As long as he refused, the Genetic Pairing would be canceled automatically.

She followed the staff member down what felt like an endlessly long corridor. Other people they passed kept glancing curiously at her, but whenever she looked back, they quickly turned away.

Layla frowned slightly, feeling something was off. But with this being her first marriage, she couldn't tell if that was normal. 'Maybe they're staring because I used the Genetic Pairing Program. Hardly anyone does that anymore.'

Layla turned to the staff member. ""What's my match like?"" Even though she didn't plan to marry him, she wanted to know who she'd be dealing with.

The staff member seemed nervous. He adjusted his glasses. ""You'll see when you meet him,"" he said, as if he didn't dare to say more.

They finally stopped outside the lounge. Its door bore a gilded emblem, which looked strangely familiar to Layla. The staff member said respectfully, ""Ms. Sullivan, please go in. Your match is already inside.""

Layla looked puzzled. ""Aren't you coming in with me?"" She hadn't expected to be left alone with a complete stranger.

The staff member hesitated, then shook his head. ""Marriage is a private matter. It's better if you talk alone first. If you need anything, coffee, for example, just ask the service robot inside.""

Layla nodded. ""Your service has been very helpful. Do you take reviews? I'll give you nine stars,"" she said, genuinely appreciating his polite manner.

The man's expression shifted slightly. He kept his smile with some effort. ""Thank you. If you're satisfied later, I would be happy to accept a nine-star review.""

His words felt odd to her, and he seemed almost too respectful. 'Maybe he still thinks I'm Karter Sullivan's daughter,' she thought. Karter Sullivan, after all, was a duke.

Then she shrugged the thoughts off, turning and pushing the door open. It slid shut slowly behind her with a soft hum.

The room was bright, lit by floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the crisscrossing aerial lanes outside. Layla recognized at once that the furnishings were top-grade.

The wine cabinet held all kinds of rare vintages, and the circular red sofa in the middle was upholstered in upper-tier starbeast hide, soft to the touch.

Then she noticed the air was thick with the scent of cedar. It was the smell of pheromones. Her gaze moved to the carpet by the window, where an extraordinarily beautiful young man stood.

His features were striking. Leaning against the window, his height was hard to judge, but his long legs suggested he was tall. He wore a plain white shirt and black trousers, the cuffs and waist finely embroidered. The clothes spoke of quiet expense.

His silver-gray hair fell in loose strands across his forehead, but it didn't hide his arresting eyes, which were wide and clear like a starry sky. And he was watching her, unblinking. Behind him, several large, fluffy white tails swayed gently.

'He's breathtaking.' As Layla breathed in the rich cedar scent, the air in the room seemed to grow warmer. ""Your pheromones smell good,"" Layla said before she could stop herself.

""Do you like it?"" The young man's voice was slightly husky, yet incredibly pleasing to the ear, like music from an ancient instrument.

Layla's heart gave a small jump, but she kept her voice steady. ""I should explain. I didn't submit the marriage application. I came to talk things through with you. But right now, I think you should take a suppressant first.""

The young man's fluffy white fox ears twitched. His long lashes lowered briefly, as if trying to clear the haze from his mind. It was clear his rut had taken over, leaving his shifter instincts mostly in control.

Looking at those soft ears, Layla felt a restless urge inside her chest, like a cat gently scratching. 'This is bad. His pheromones are starting to get to me. Fox shifters' scent really is tempting.'

She cleared her throat, trying to settle herself. ""Did you forget to bring your suppressant? I'll go out and ask for one,"" she said, already turning toward the door.

She moved quickly, because the urge to close the distance and kiss him was already too strong. If she stayed any longer, she wasn't sure she could hold back.

Since Layla had fully awakened as a shifter, she'd never come across pheromones she liked this much. As for her former fiancé, Caleb James, she had never even caught his scent.

Caleb had always been polite and proper, telling her he would rely on suppressants during his rut until after their wedding. Yet he ended up spending his rut with Xanthe instead.

Layla liked everything about the stunning fox-eared young man before her. His scent, his look and his voice were all annoyingly perfect. He was exactly her type, and in every way, he outshone Caleb completely.

Still, Layla clung to her last bit of sense. 'I came here to end this arrangement. If Xanthe hadn't applied for it with my optical computer, he wouldn't be involved at all. Taking advantage of him in his rut wouldn't be right.'

But just as she reached the door and gripped the handle, the cedar scent grew suddenly stronger behind her. ""Star, don't go, please,"" the young man said.

His voice was so close that she felt his warm breath against her ear. Both of her ears flushed pink instantly, and she spun around.

Chapter 3 Can You Do Me A Favor?

The silver-haired young man, who had been by the window, was now standing right beside Layla. He stood a full head taller than her, despite her own height of 5'7"".

They stood so close that it felt like she was already in his arms. Layla took a step back and bumped against the metal doorknob with a soft thud. 'Ouch! That's going to leave a bruise,' she thought.

When she looked up, the young man stepped forward again, closing the distance between them. His warm breath brushed her cheeks, making them burn.

His striking blue eyes fixed on hers, full of wounded confusion, like a child who'd been pushed away. ""Do you hate me?"" he asked, his voice low and rough.

They were too close. Layla felt herself sinking into the heavy cedar scent around her. She managed to shake her head. ""No,"" she said, her voice quieter than she intended. ""I don't hate you.""

The young man pressed closer, his voice low. ""Then do you hate the smell of my pheromones?"" He couldn't understand why she was trying to leave so soon.

""No, I like it. A lot,"" Layla admitted honestly, even as she tried to keep her original purpose in mind.

At her words, a bright, genuine smile spread across his face. He reached out and gently drew her into his arms, his voice softening. ""I like you, too. So can you do me a favor? Please?""

It was almost impossible to say no. Layla held onto his hands, clinging to her last thread of reason. ""I truly like you. But I never planned to marry. Someone else used my computer to submit the application. If you're not willing—""

""I am willing."" The young man spoke before she could finish, then lifted his gaze to hers. A faint flush from his rut colored his pale cheeks, making him look both vulnerable and breathtakingly beautiful.

He added softly, like a well-behaved child, ""My family has always married through the Genetic Pairing Program. And according to the results, we're genetically perfect for each other.""

'What kind of family hands over their marriages completely to a genetic program?' Layla thought. The rich cedar scent was already wrapping around her.

Before her last bit of sense slipped away, she glanced toward the window. ""What about that window?""

The young man cupped her face gently, a note of soft complaint in his voice. ""It's one-way glass. No one can see in from outside. Don't look out there. Look at me, okay?""

Layla's breath caught. For a long moment, she was completely lost in his eyes, a clear, captivating shade of Klein blue that seemed to swallow her whole world.

\*\*\*\*\*

Unlike the intimate warmth in the VIP lounge, Sullivan Manor was quiet and still. A handsome man in dark-gray military uniform stepped casually from an aero-vehicle.

Nolan had just finished a six-month assignment and was finally home on a month's leave. When Harper heard her eldest son had returned, she rushed out to meet him. ""Nolan, you're not hurt anywhere, are you?""

Nolan smiled fondly. ""Mom, we were mining energy crystals this time, not fighting void raiders. It was perfectly safe.""

Xanthe, holding Harper's arm, added warmly, ""Nolan, Mom was just worried. But you're right. You're so capable that even if you did run into raiders, they'd be the ones in trouble.""

Nolan gave a slight nod toward Xanthe, whose features held a faint echo of his own. But Xanthe noticed the distance in his manner.

She kept her polite smile in place, though a hint of resentment stirred behind her eyes. 'Why is my own brother so cold toward me?'

Nolan glanced around, a question in his eyes. ""Mom, isn't Layla home?"" He and Layla had grown up side by side. Her absence felt strange.

Harper's face clouded over instantly. Nolan felt something was off, but he decided he'd message Layla himself later. As he stepped into the living room, his boot came down on something hard.

He looked down. It was the optical computer he had given Layla. ""Why is this here?"" he asked, picking it up. His expression tightened when he realized it had been wiped clean.

Xanthe knew she couldn't hide the fact any longer. She bit her lip, looking wounded. ""It's all my fault. I made a mistake and upset Layla so much that she left. We don't know where she went.""

The mention of Layla stirred Harper's own frustration. 'I raised that girl like my own for ten years. The moment she got angry, she called me Mrs. Sullivan and walked out? After all we did for her.'

Harper's voice turned sharp. ""Xanthe didn't mean any harm. She was just trying to download study materials for her exam. How could we know that Layla would fly off the handle like that?""

Nolan's fingers tightened around the smooth casing of the optical computer. He gave Xanthe, who was still hiding behind their mother, a long, cold look.

""If clicking around can accidentally file a Genetic Pairing application,"" he said, his voice icy, ""then you stand no chance of getting into Imperial Academy next year.""

Xanthe flinched under his gaze. Harper frowned deeply. ""Nolan, how can you speak to your own sister like that? We lost her for so long...""

Nolan had heard these words a thousand times. He didn't wait for her to finish. Snatching up his military cap, he turned and walked out.

Harper hurried after him into the front hall, her voice strained with worry. ""Nolan, you just got home. Where are you going now?""

""To the Central Nexus to bring Layla home."" Nolan turned, his gaze cold as it settled on Xanthe, who stood with red-rimmed eyes and a wounded expression. ""And you will apologize to her properly.""

As his figure vanished past the gate, Xanthe broke down. She covered her face with her hands, sobbing openly.

""Mom, why is Nolan treating me like this? I'm his real sister. Why does he care more about Layla? Should I have never come back? Should I have just died out there?"" she said.

Harper pulled her daughter into a tight hug, her heart aching. ""Xanthe, don't say that. There's just been a misunderstanding. When Nolan gets back, I'll make sure he apologizes to you.""

Xanthe cried in her mother's arms, but beneath the tears, her mind was cold. 'I hope Layla is already married to a loser by the time he finds her. Then all this is worth it. She'll be gone from this family for good.'

\*\*\*\*\*

In the luxurious VIP lounge, the rich scent of pheromones still hung in the air. Layla rubbed her eyes and woke up, finding herself alone on the red sofa, a light blanket draped over her.

The beautiful fox-eared young man was gone. If not for the faint trace of cedar still clinging to the room, she might have thought it was all a dream.

'What just happened? Did he change his mind and leave?' Layla wondered, sitting up slowly.

Chapter 4 Do You Want A Divorce?

Layla gritted her teeth. 'What a streak of bad luck.' She decided to head to Imperial Academy to register first and buy a new optical computer. As for money, she'd have to earn enough starcoins fast, and pay back the Sullivans for good.

Thankfully, the lounge had a bathroom. Layla took a quick shower, put on her Imperial Academy uniform, and left. As she stepped out of the elevator, she nearly bumped into the staff member with glasses from earlier. He looked slightly startled to see her.

Layla felt a flicker of embarrassment, thinking of how long she'd been in that lounge with the fox-eared young man. 'It's partly his fault anyway. He should have told me my match was in rut,' she told herself.

First interaction happened when we were in line at the office cafe - very brief one - and I got her number entirely by luck after I had to reach out to someone from her team about a specific project.

We bonded very quickly after finding out that we were both cat lovers. We have been texting every day for 2 months, often for hours, but I'm still ""intimidated"" to talk to her in real life. I am prone to overthinking and trying to plan out interactions, so I keep thinking about what I will say and how to approach her and end up getting too overwhelmed to do anything.

Our teams sit quite close to each other so we can see each other but I keep psyching myself out of going over to chat. She also doesn't come over, but she smiles and waves if we make eye contact. She also texts me sometimes when we are both working and has made remarks to indicate that she is at least noticing me, such as asking if I got a haircut recently.

To be very clear I don't think it's on her to make first contact - I am very frustrated at myself for being too paralyzed to act normal in real life. I recognize that the texting only thing is a barrier to us actually getting closer and I need to get over this to have a chance at a proper friendship let alone a relationship.

I also worry that I am reading the vibe wrong - that I think she might be interested in more when she is just being friendly - because of a recent incident when I texted her asking if she'd like to grab coffee after work, she said she would ""think about it"" but never got back to me. We have texting like normal ever since. Was that her way of subtly saying no?

I have only ever been in one relationship where the girl asked me out first so I don't know how to go about this. I am also shy and quiet even though I have been forced to learn to present as more outgoing due to work.

Tl;dr: starting talking to my crush at work but never in real life because I keep choking before I can take action and wondering if there is anything I can do about it.",1,1767782526.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1q6c5e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedMentality/comments/1q6c5e2/how_to_actually_deliver_a_great_presentation_the/,How to ACTUALLY Deliver a Great Presentation: The Science of What Works (Without Being Cringe),"studied hundreds of TED talks and bombed enough presentations to figure this out. turns out most advice is useless.

spent way too much time analyzing why some presentations stick while others make people check their phones. watched everything from Steve Jobs keynotes to academic disasters. read research on cognitive load theory and attention spans. the gap between what people think makes a good presentation vs what actually works is HUGE.

here's the thing: society loves performative confidence. we're told to ""fake it till you make it"" and memorize every word. but neuroscience shows that's exactly backwards. your brain can't simultaneously retrieve memorized content AND read the room. you end up robotic or anxious, usually both.

most presentation advice is recycled garbage that makes you worse. ""imagine the audience naked"" wtf? ""practice in front of a mirror"" cool, now you're optimizing for yourself watching yourself instead of connecting with humans.

here's what actually moves the needle:

stop writing scripts, start building frameworks

your working memory can hold like 4 chunks of information max. memorizing paragraphs overloads this system. instead, know your key points cold and trust yourself to articulate them naturally in the moment. 

research from cognitive psychology (specifically Sweller's work on cognitive load) proves this. when you read memorized content from your brain, you're using mental resources that should be processing audience feedback. you miss confused faces, lose timing, sound like a robot.

framework approach: know your opening hook, 3 main points with supporting examples, transitions, and close. everything else is improvised based on the energy in the room. sounds scary but this is how the best speakers operate.

your content structure matters more than your delivery

the ""primacy and recency effect"" is real. people remember your first 60 seconds and last 60 seconds way better than the middle. yet most presentations bury the interesting stuff in slide 47.

lead with your most provocative insight or the question your talk answers. not ""agenda"" slides. not ""about me"" slides. something that makes people think ""oh shit i need to pay attention.""

check out Nancy Duarte's work on presentation structure (she analyzed hundreds of great speeches). or read ""Resonate"" by her. this book breaks down the hidden story structure in every memorable presentation. shows you how the best speakers create narrative tension and resolution. made me completely rethink how i structure content. honestly the most practical presentation book that exists.

slides should remove cognitive load, not add it

most slides are designed to work as standalone documents. terrible for presentations. your audience can either read your text heavy slide OR listen to you. not both. it's neurologically impossible.

better: one concept per slide. minimal text. high impact visuals. your slides should SUPPORT what you're saying, not duplicate it. 

Assertion Evidence framework from research is gold here. Instead of title slides saying ""Market Analysis"" show the actual insight: ""Our market grew 340% while competitors declined."" one powerful statement or visual that drives your point home.

nervous energy is just misidentified excitement

your body's stress response before presenting is identical to excitement. increased heart rate, adrenaline, heightened focus. the only difference is your interpretation.

research from Harvard psychologist Alison Wood Brooks showed that reframing anxiety as excitement significantly improved performance. saying ""i'm excited"" out loud before high pressure situations actually works. sounds stupid but the data is solid.

also: channel that energy into vocal variety and movement. the worst presentations are low energy. better to be too animated than too flat. people forgive enthusiasm, they don't forgive boring.

practice the right way

most people practice by running through their content alone. useless. you need to practice with cognitive load that mirrors the real thing.

record yourself on video presenting to an empty room. then watch it. brutal but incredibly effective. you'll catch your filler words, awkward pauses, confusing explanations. 

better: practice in front of 2-3 people who will ask questions and look skeptical. present in different environments. practice gets you comfortable with your content, but pressure practice gets you comfortable with discomfort.

the BEST practice method: teach the content conversationally to a friend over coffee. if you can explain your ideas naturally in conversation, you can present them. if you can't, your content isn't clear enough yet.

audience connection beats polish

eye contact with real individuals (not scanning the room) creates neurological connection. your audience's mirror neurons literally fire in response to your authenticity.

pause for impact. silence is powerful but most speakers are terrified of it. a 3 second pause after an important point lets it land. also makes you seem more thoughtful and confident.

move with purpose but don't pace. standing still during important points focuses attention. moving during transitions or stories adds energy.

use the Hemingway app for your script/notes

if you do write stuff out (which helps clarify thinking), run it through Hemingway app. highlights complex sentences, passive voice, unnecessary adverbs. makes your language more conversational and clear. most presentation language is way too formal and that creates distance.

your opening hook determines everything

you have about 30 seconds before people mentally check out or lock in. start with a surprising statistic, a provocative question, a brief story that illustrates your main point, or a powerful statement that challenges conventional thinking.

avoid: thanking everyone for coming, apologizing for anything, reading your biography, explaining your agenda. nobody cares yet. make them care first.

example of a strong hook for a presentation on productivity: ""you're not lazy, you're just solving the wrong problems. i tracked every productive hour i had last year and 73% of my effort was completely wasted."" now people are curious.

the single best resource for improving

watch ""The Moth"" podcast/videos. real people telling true stories on stage, no slides, pure connection. you'll learn more about pacing, emotion, and holding attention than any presentation course.

presentations aren't about perfection, they're about connection. the goal isn't to impress people with how smart you are, it's to transfer an idea from your brain to theirs as efficiently as possible.

most presentation anxiety comes from trying to be someone you're not. the more you can show up as yourself (slightly amplified), the more comfortable you'll be and the better you'll connect.

your ideas deserve to be heard. shitty presentation skills shouldn't be the bottleneck.",1,1767782521.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False

It's not a super big problem IMO, but it does personally annoy me quite a bit.

For instance, not being able to drink out of OR heat up thermoses. Why?? It's the most ridiculous thing, the fact they act more like lunchboxes for your drinks than thermoses. I honestly don't think I'd be nearly as bothered if they actually were just small metal boxes with thermal/conduction prevention. I personally don't even carry thermoses around because they annoy me so much, I just don't think the hassle is worth it even if I have like 5 coffees in my inventor.

Another one that really annoys is rope climbs. Mackenzie, are you a fucking moron or something? TAKE THE BACKPACK OFF. Tie the rope around it, climb up the rope, and then pull the backpack up. That is so much easier than trying to climb up a rope with 20+kg of shit on you. Also, why don't you tie the rope around yourself before you climb up as well? Do you not know how to tie a knot??? That way if you fall you get caught by something instead of just hitting the ground at terminal velocity and fucking dying. 

There are a bunch of tiny things that don't bother me nearly as much, such as the fact you can't take water out of a fishing hole, or cut up food, or do anything with the bones/antlers/hooves you get from most animals, or how leveling up most skills work (firestarting skill especially), but this stuff still peeves me a bit.

Hiii, so yesterday I was hired for my first job after graduating. I got into a very nice government job. I’m especially excited because the team I’m joining seems sooo so nice, and it’s exactly what I need after multiple years of social isolation… It felt very nice with them. It’s quite a close, informal, and feminine team I think. I think the vibe fits me so well, and I’m so excited to become friends with them! They seemed quite close. Even the team manager, I didn’t feel any hierarchy at all. It was more like the older sister vibe. It’s strange because it’s supposed to be a serious government job. Afterwards, I celebrated by getting a cappuccino in a coffee shop by myself.

But then the trouble began. I couldn’t calm down. I kinda felt manic or something. Maybe it’s a lack of emotion regulation that turned into overstimulation. I started drinking alcohol in the evening, smoked cannabis, ate junkfood and I didn’t sleep until 4 a.m.… Why is it that even feeling happy brings me out of balance 😭

Also hopefully I don’t mess things up with them by making social mistakes 😮‍💨",4,1767782184.0,AutisticWithADHD,4,0.84,False

Got the robot thinking I could get more out of this coffee. Shots have good crema but more bitter than the ROK.

If I grind coarser shots are very quick and low pressure so a little lost in how to proceed. Was thinking of buying the pressurised basket for the robot and just treating it as an upgraded ROK.

Also not 100% sure on the difference between bitter and sour shots but didn’t have this issue on the smart shot with same grind level - halfway between espresso and percolator in my grinder.
