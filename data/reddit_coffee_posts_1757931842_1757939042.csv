1nhk7p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1nhk7p6/i_feel_alone/,I feel alone,"I have a beautiful 13 week old baby boy who is the light of my life. Of course, it‚Äôs hard work nonetheless. I had to quit my dream job as an ED RN due to conflicting hours with daycares and lack there of on the weekends to find a hospital administration job - 8-4 M-F. However, the training has been requiring me to commute to hospitals 30-50 minutes away, and I‚Äôm taking a big pay cut. I know it‚Äôs temporary, so I‚Äôm not complaining.

My complaints are due to my husband. Now before anyone bashes him, he is my best friend - he‚Äôs the best cat dad, a loving father, an amazing human. He helps keep the house clean without nagging, does all of the yard work, and pays all of the bills. The money situation is a whole other conversation that I‚Äôll spare you all from, but we are well off (once our loans are paid off). 

I feel so alone and without support. He works different schedules on the regular - 7a-2p, 2p-11p, 7a-7p, 7p-7a - as well as different hospital sites. I‚Äôm very understanding that it‚Äôs difficult for him to wake up early to help me as I get ready for work when he gets home late or has to work a later shift and needs more sleep. However, he‚Äôs not understanding HOW TIRED AND STRESSED I AM. 

To leave at 7a, I have to get up at 4a just to eat breakfast, drink coffee, get dressed, feed the baby, get my pump parts all together, put the baby back to sleep, and entertain him! I do everything I can to make the mornings easier - forego a decent breakfast and mix coffee with protein powder, shower the night before, lay all of my clothes out, wash the never-ending pump parts - and it‚Äôs still not enough. 

When I have to leave and I‚Äôm not the one taking my son to daycare at 630a, my husband complains that he has to be up with the baby when he‚Äôs so tired. He  has never had to wake up in the middle of the night, doesn‚Äôt do wash my pump parts without complaint (I just do it myself now to avoid it), never had to take the baby in so early, doesn‚Äôt pack my lunches, or gotten ready for work with the baby home. Heck, he will bring the baby to daycare on his days off so he can have ‚Äúhis time‚Äù running errands and working out. 

He doesn‚Äôt understand the sacrifices I‚Äôve done to make this work. He won‚Äôt let me be a SAHM because of my student loans, he brushes off anything I have to say about my emotional wellbeing and somehow brings it back to my lack of working out. I‚Äôve even written him an email articulating how I feel and how it hurt my feelings to be told ‚Äúyou need to be put on meds‚Äù when I finally screamed at him one day (when I was trying to get ready for a baby shower and he put a crying baby on the bed for me to attend to while he stretched instead of consoling/getting bottles ready/whatever.)

Last night I asked him to take the baby to daycare as late as possible (10a) because I have to be at a hospital 40 minutes away at 7a instead of 8 and I wanted to do a quick 30 minutes at the gym afterwards since I don‚Äôt get the luxury of ‚Äúhaving a day off.‚Äù All he said was ‚Äúmake sure you put the baby down for a nap before you leave.‚Äù Seriously? As I sit here drinking my lukewarm protein coffee, I‚Äôm just trying to calculate what time I would have to wake up in order to meets ALL of our needs. Baby woke up at 4 with me on his own accord, fell back asleep, and will probably wake up again at 6 when I have to go. I‚Äôve already been late to work THREE times in my first week because of these kinds of things. Do I need to wake up at 3am instead? Seriously, what does he want from me?

I just feel like I‚Äôm the only one picking up the slack and it fucking hurts. 

There‚Äôs SO much more but I just can‚Äôt even think about it right now.

Now, after much thought I believe that Substack is actually done and dusted.

You might think that it is talk of the town and the most hip blogging platform these days but hear me out.

The substack business model doesn't make sense. Knowledge have always been essentially free. Books pack a tonne of knowledge and very often life's work of people and sell for $10-$40 a piece. Books cost also include the paper, binding, distribution, publisher and writers get a small cut. Self published books have higher margins but are typically cheaper as well. Substack's minimum monthly charge is $5 per user per month. Now how much useful information can an individual possibly create in a month.

Substack and their founders somehow think that sending a newsletter to willing patrons is good enough to build a huge company. I am not saying it doesn't have a market. It does. Just like patreon or buy me a coffee. Why it is done and dusted is because they aim to become a goto publishing platform. They raised $100 million. Now to get VC's $100 million's worth back is impossible in the market Substack is playing in.

Substack is not profitable. Medium wasn't profitable either and had no clue what to do. They also came up with weird business model. Medium's business model was still less expensive for consumer than Substack. Medium is a thing of past. Substack will follow suit.

Substack has done many pivots already. Starting from a blogging platform to social media and now reverting on their stance on Ads. You can tell the founders are struggling and VCs has pushed the pedal of ""go big or go home"".

I've extrapolated all possibilities and there is none I can see Substack work. They might add Ads. A youtube like model might work but it still has to scaled down in terms of business. Youtube provide entertainment, music, education. Substack provides mostly knowledge or news.

Knowledge has to be free (or near free). There is no other way humans will accept it. Knowledge which is paid is biased to begin with and not worth it. It's only lindy.",1,1757938478.0,lykhari,1,1.0,False

A past time I loved to do a as the bitterness of my dark coffee engulfed my tastebuds, as I enjoyed my quiet stroll passing by the willow trees, or when i impatiently fidgeted when its slow at my medicore serving job at the local cafe.
Every random passerby is figuring out a life that is unique to their own self.
Challenges, milestones, and emotions that I can easily conjecture from others as a I sit comfortably on my rickety swing on my front porch.

Different people, discovering their own lives.
It‚Äôs fascinating to me.

Usually I overlook people‚Ä¶only passing by my mind‚Ä¶
but you, I remember.

I noticed you always slowed down when the delicate flowers bloomed.
Admiring the emerging petals, excited to see what beautiful creation it would turn into.

Chrysanthemums.
Those were your favorite.

It was if the world paused around you.
The surrounding blossoms captivated you as if the sweet aroma casted a spell that transported you into a dream of fairytales.
Then you continue your walk,
with a smile that was brighter than the warmth ascending from the fog. 

I never got mad when you picked them from my front garden, unlike my grumpy neighbors.
You sang to old rock music, with a voice that even the bird would hang around too listen, while their  precious babies would be crying for food.
You picked up trash you had come across left from the reckless teenagers up the hill.
Greeted early morning joggers.
Even brought your own treats to feed to the stray cats.

You seemed so kind-hearted.
I always wondered where you were walking too‚Ä¶
To your day job, I had assumed‚Ä¶

When I stopped seeing you, my first thought was 
you had quit to work some place else.
Perhaps you found a better paying job more in the city.
I imagine you working in the fashion industry, based off your unique choice of clothing.

Maybe you fell in love with someone and moved across the country.
That, I hope not.
Because even though I never met you, it felt like I was falling in love.

The way you admired earths creations, the light hitting your eyes making it look like a pot of honey‚Ä¶the way you walked with confidence‚Ä¶
I wished the best for you, on whatever journey you were embarking.

I started to notice other things once you stopped coming around.
A family of squirrels had a routine of grabbing nuts from the oak tree hanging above my humble home. 
They would chase each other around until one got a stomach ache, then run back under my neighbors fence.

But nothing is as interesting as you‚Ä¶ I missed seeing you.

So I‚Äôll write it here for now, to remember.

When I saw you on the news, that‚Äôs the first time I learned your name‚Ä¶
Anna.
What a beautiful name‚Ä¶
From all the pictures, videos and comments I saw, I knew you were loved by many.
So this, I never would have expected.
I saw you everyday, creating a narrative about you in my head,
but this was never part of it.

Im sorry I never introduced myself to be your friend.
Im sorry this world is so cruel.
I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt save you from the harsh reality of what we call life.
I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get a fair chance for yourself to become happier‚Ä¶

This is my first attempt at a query letter and first time posting anything on reddit, so apologies if a flubbed the etiquette. Thank you for taking the time to read this and all comments are appreciated! 

  
**Query**

For Jacki, a UFO expert, the arrival of flying saucers over the nation‚Äôs skies comes with some perks. It launches her from a bland Defense Department cubicle, where she spent her days writing reports about unexplained lights and swamp gas, to a world of secret underground headquarters and high stakes decisions. However, as she finds it increasingly difficult to craft a message the public will accept about this new *Visitation*, she will become less and less certain this is the job for her. Her doubt only gets worse as the strange discs begin to send messages out directly ‚Äì appearing on people‚Äôs computers and phones ‚Äì which seem to contradict every statement she‚Äôs made.

For Zeke, who Jacki dumped right before the *Visitation*, the appearance of flying saucers comes as a useful distraction. When they arrive she finds herself hearing a voice that seems to be of some spiritual origin but, rather than listen to it or question what it wants from her, she uses the anarchy of this new era of aliens-being-real to make up a different mission for herself: She‚Äôll traverse the nation‚Äôs capital ‚Äì filled with riots and religious zealots ‚Äì and try to reunite with Jacki who she is still desperately in love with and has decided needs saving. This quixotic journey keeps getting sidetracked by a divinely directed assignment that she will do everything to ignore.

For Vav, a guardian angel assigned to guide and protect Zeke (who is slated to become a prophet), the appearance of these strange discs is awful. Pursuing one of the vessels with the hopes of finding its origin gets them zapped with a laser beam, a painful experience that will leave them questioning everything from the existence of God to the reason for human suffering. Going back-and-forth between the chaos on Earth to a celestial realm of higher-ranking angels ‚Äì all of whom seem to be less and less certain about what the meaning of these discs could be ‚Äì they will watch as their mission to lead one person turns into a challenge that the fate of the world might rest upon.

BEAMING UP (70K), will be familiar to readers of *The Ministry of Time* by Kaliane Bradley and *All Our Wrong Todays* by Elan Mastai in that it uses existing troupes within the sci-fi genre to explore relatable issues. As the characters navigate crisscrossing paths through a rapidly changing landscape, each will be asked to try and save what they valued most and reconsider if they want to at all.

**\[50 words on my background I'd rather not post to the internet\]**

**First 300**

Vav was there. Something had to be wrong. The woman was slumped, wedged between the sofa‚Äôs cushions, her incredibly dark, puffy, and tearless eyes staring at nothing at all. There was no blood splatter. No open wounds. None of the awful human violence Vav had gotten used to. Some wreckage was in the living room ‚Äì trash on the floor, items ripped from shelves, broken picture frames ‚Äì but nothing that would weigh high the scales of tragedy. Nothing that couldn‚Äôt be fixed or healed. So Vav was left to hunch forward and stare into this young woman‚Äôs amazingly black eyes ‚Äì eyes on which they could cast no reflection ‚Äì and try to guess at what was wrong.¬†¬†

A strand of hair clung to her lower lip, glued by spit. She blinked.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Vav didn‚Äôt know what they were asking for, but, based on every encounter they‚Äôd had with a person, they assumed something bad was about to happen. ‚ÄúYou have to understand: The present may be miserable, but, The Lord has sent me so He must in some way be aware of whatever it is that makes you feel this way. I know, as a person, you might not be able to ‚Ä¶ so ‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶‚Äù Vav trailed off. ‚ÄúGod really does care, no matter what this is about.‚Äù¬†

The woman did not react. She could not hear Vav. Or see them. No one could. Vav was an angel.

‚ÄúI know, fellow child of the Lord, I am beyond conscious regard. Perhaps you can feel me in some kind of way? Perhaps you can feel that whatever it is your feeling is not forever, just a *feeling*? Can you understand that? Can that make sense to you?‚Äù The woman continued her muted stare forward. A remote control sat on the coffee table next to an empty glass and an unopened bottle of whiskey. She switched on the TV, staring through the angel with indifference.¬†

When we got together things were going really well. We both had visions for our futures and our finances were completely separate.

He moved in with me and my family (mom, stepdad, and 2 little brothers) very quickly. It did not happen on purpose, one sleepover turned into him living with us. He didn't pay any living expenses for 2 years. No rent, barely paid for this own food, and didn't really help around the house at all. My family had no idea how to bring up him paying for stuff, especially rent. We ended up having to move and now he's paying rent because we simply could not afford for him not too.

He does full time tree work and I work full time EMS and I'm in school. He makes more than me but I pay for more of our necessities. I came home one morning after working a 24, to condom wrappers on my bed. His excuse was jacking off and not wanting to clean up the mess after. A lot of people told me that he's probably cheating on me but I didn't have any real proof so I stayed with him. Im starting to think that maybe I should break up with him and I'm seeing a lot of red flags from the past two years that I completely ignored. He has his body count tattooed in tally marks on his leg, he's a borderline alcoholic, video games tend to come before me, we got a dog and he honestly treats my dog like shit. My mom keeps saying he's a good guy and that I should give him more chances. But I feel so much more like an adult than him despite being younger with less life experience. I'm really not sure what to do. 

I keep track of his school work. He has been on the brink of failing since he asked me to step in, I have passed all of the classes he's needed my help with. He passed and isn't in school anymore except for the state test for the certification.

He has his good moments that make me feel like maybe he isn't too far gone. He opens doors for me, makes me coffee in the morning sometimes. But it feels more like we're roomates than partners. I want him to succeed in everything he does but sometimes it feels like he isn't going too without someone always pushing him. He has no self motivation. 

I desperately need someone to talk some sense into me before we move again.

Characters are me and my small dog, Wilson.

Chapter 1: Foreshadowing
Tuesday night, 6pm.

Wilson needed a bath. Desperately. The day before had been a muddy mess and his fur had taken the brunt of it. In order to give Wilson a bath at home, I need to do it in the laundry tub - but as Wilson was wiggling around in protest of cleanliness, he kept bumping the hose that comes out of the washing machine, and so was forced to move that out of the way so that I could finish washing the filthy monster. We got it done, and all was forgiven with a duck tendon and a dinosaur toy.

Chapter 2: Choccy Milk
Wednesday night, 7pm.

It had been a long day at work, but still a good day. So when I got home, I took Wilson for a walk and then starting folding the laundry. Wilson was chilling in front of the fire like the croissant he is, I was doing my thing, it was great. So I decided to treat myself - I had a craving for a nice cold cup of choccy milk. Why not? I went to the kitchen and poured myself a big cup of choccy milk, took a couple of sips and then settled back down to fold the second basket of laundry. I stood up and got my clothes to put them in my room, and 30 seconds later, I hear some suspicious noises coming from the lounge room. 
In the 30 seconds I was gone, Wilson had reached up onto the coffee table, and had somehow knocked my cup and spilt the choccy milk. Everywhere. Coffee table? No it's now a lake with streams of milk spilling down the side. Anything that's on the table got a healthy coating of it. My phone got covered. And the rug. Oh the rug. It's thick, soft and luscious... and I watch in slow motion as the milk is slowly absorbed into the fibres.

I ran into the hallway to grab some sacrificial towels, quickly trying to sop up the mess while a string of cuss words left my lips that would have shocked a sailor. I had to hold my leg out to stop Wilson from coming in to ""help"" licking it up, while desperately trying to make a choccy milk disaster into‚Ä¶ well just a choccy milk accident. But unbeknownst to me, Wilson had started licking. And licking and licking and licking. I was too absorbed in my efforts, that I didn't realise that Wilson had, in fact, gotten chocolate milk all over himself. I‚Äôm talking legs, chest, and somehow the back? I later only realised that small fact when I went to pat him and his fur was... crusty... in the parts he couldn't reach to lick.
I eventually realised I had a carpet cleaner that I could use - I just to learn how to use it...
By the time I was done, it was 9.30 at night. Wilson was happily passed out on the couch, I was having a mourning ceremony for the cup of milk. 
Time for bed, I thought, but the towels I'd initially used for the lake, had since started to smell *rank.* And, knowing the smell would only get worse overnight, I popped them in the washing machine and turned it on. Wilson and I fell asleep to the low rumble of the washing machine working away. Sweet dreams‚Ä¶

Chapter 3: A Need For More Towels
Thursday, 8am.

You know, it's always nice to have a bit of a sleep in. Especially after having to get up so early for my other work shifts (5am). The bed was nice and warm, Wilson was so snugly and cute, all was quiet and well. So relaxing and such a nice way to get up. Everything had been forgiven after the shenanigans of the night before. 
So, we get up and do our usual thing: I go and open up the door to the laundry to let Wilson outside while I get ready... except he's tiptoeing. Why is he tiptoeing? I go to stand on the floor of the laundry, and I was instantly glad that I hadn't put socks on. 
You see, dear reader, herein lies the problem - whoever owned this house before us was a psychopath and thought that putting carpet in the laundry was a good idea. Unfortunately, my parents have never had the time or money to fix this atrocity. So, when I stepped onto the floor in the laundry, it wasn't just wet. My foot sank, bubbles came up, a ring of water appeared around the edges of my feet, and finally, the tell-tale *squish* of not just a swamp-like carpet. 
My life flashed before my eyes, and that stupid hose floats to the surface of my mind. 
Wilson got kicked outside while I furiously started throwing everything that was on the floor out into non-marsh areas. Bin, laundry basket, detergent, the rice and potato we store in there (we don‚Äôt have room anywhere else). It was all thrown with reckless abandon, because even though it may have been like that for 8-9 hours now, there was no way I was letting it sit for a moment longer. And then it was off to the linen closet to get a towel. And another and another. 5 should do, right? I can use the one that's hanging in the laundry. No. 6 was not enough. Within seconds of standing on these folded towels, the water was seeping to the top and bubbling around my feet. I panicked. More towels. The sodden ones got chucked into a dry area to be hung up later, being replaced by towels that got soaked just as fast. 13 towels got used.

Chapter 4: The Aftermath
Monday night, 6pm.

After 4 days, the carpet is now mostly dry. I‚Äôm still not keen to wear socks in there though.
Wilson got cranky at me because I had to bathe him again to get the milk off.
The lounge room doesn‚Äôt smell, so I guess I got Lake Choccy Milk out good enough.
I think I‚Äôm going to pass on Choccy milks for a while.
And you‚Äôll all be happy to know that the hose is back where it belongs.

TL;DR 
I gave my dog a bath and took the laundry machine hose out of the tub to do so. My dog knocks over a cup of choccy milk, which I clean up but make a mess of some towels. Put towels on to wash overnight, and woke up to flooded carpet floor in the laundry. The floor is mostly dried 4 days later after 13 towels. I have sworn off choccy milk and my dog needed another bath after being covered in milk.

1nhk0it,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nhk0it,Has anyone had false positives that were THIS positive?,"
How many false positive urine tests have you received? Have you ever had a false negative blood HCG?

Any idea what could have happened in my situation to cause multiple positive home tests (purchased from different stores) but a blood test <1 HCG, lots of symptoms, and light bleeding 3 months post tubal ligation. I am thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. 

I just had my 3rd baby in March (I have a 4 year old, 2 year old, and 5 month old). I am breastfeeding and haven‚Äôt had my period yet (for me it tends to return at 12 months post partum.) I chose to have a tubal ligation in May since we didn‚Äôt intend to have more kids and to decrease my risk of cancer given my family history. 

For about 1-1.5 weeks at the end of August, I was experiencing definitive pregnancy symptoms that I had with all 3 of my kids. 

Then last Friday 9/5 I bled after intercourse (I don‚Äôt usually bleed). Then Saturday morning my pregnancy symptoms were undeniable so I took a test and it was instantly positive (photo attached).I went to the ER since it was a weekend and my husband and I were concerned it was ectopic in light of a tubal ligation. My HCG at the hospital was <1. They said it must be a false positive urine test and sent me home.

Sunday morning I had another positive test but the line was much lighter. By the following day my symptoms were subsiding.

I moved on, chocked it up to a weird series of events. My therapist (I have PPD/PPA) insisted I message my doctor to clarify the details (since we never had a discussion about all details) and make sure there isn‚Äôt a risk that it was a chemical ectopic and product was left behind‚Ä¶given that this was 3 months after my tubes were removed. So, I messaged my doctor. Her response essentially said that ‚ÄúYou had false positives, your brain imagined a pregnancy, you imagined the symptoms, the bloodwork was <1 HCG, dont ask me about this again.‚Äù 

I do have anxiety but I‚Äôm not nuts! This is the same doctor who did my tubal ligation 3 months ago so I think that she would rather tell me I‚Äôm crazy than consider the fact that there may be an error with her surgery. I know human error can impact blood results, and I personally had doctors, from a fertility clinic no less, call me up and say that their lab mistakenly switched patient vials and we have to get new blood work done. So I know it‚Äôs possible that a mistake could happen.

The more I think about it, the more it seems too coincidental. My symptoms were real, i was bloated, peeing all night long, nauseous (anything triggered me‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt feed my dogs, drink coffee, smell a towel that hung in the bathroom for a day after my husband used it (that was my first pregnancy symptom with my last kid), insatiable appetite, craving salty French fries and mass amounts of protein, exhausted by 8 pm, falling asleep doing my kids bedtime, fatigue during the day, insomnia randomly at night, etc. Even my Apple Watch data change from mid August onward (HRV decreased and steadied out). These were all things I experienced with my other pregnancies as well. 

Since I had my tubal, I didn‚Äôt think I could get pregnant. I had no reason to assume I would be pregnant and imagine these symptoms. It was only when the symptoms were so undeniable that I took the test. I truly felt pregnant. I don‚Äôt even want to try to have a conversation with my doctor about it out of fear she will say I‚Äôm crazy but I really do think I had a chemical pregnancy and something must have failed with my tubal ligation.

On the train ride a couple of months ago, I saw this really pretty girl sitting on the train reading, and i told my friend. She 9and all her other friends) egged me on to ask for her insta. Ive never asked anyone out before, so i was nervous, and we got off at the same stop. So i did, and I got her insta, and we walked to university (turns out we went to the same university)

Fast forward around 3 months later, I asked her an important question. Since all we've been doing is talking on Instagram, and meeting up every week for coffee (unfortunately, mainly me asking) I decided that if our interests don't align, then im wasting my time by constantly asking her to coffee (however she always agrees too meet up). l So i told her that I really liked her, and asked her if she wanted to go on a proper date. Her response (in a nutshell)

""Hey i really appreciate you asking this, but even im not sure myself if i want a relationship right now. ive never been asked out and you were the first person thats come up to me and asked for my insta. Im really sorry but i don't really know what i want right now"".

Yes, im not naive, and this is basically another way of saying ""sorry im not interested"". but a couple of things kept me on. 1: She actually had never been in a relationship before, and didnt have any guy friends. i dont know if that changes much, but it seems like it. 2: i would consider her a very honest and ""speak your mind"" person, so if she says something she might actually mean it"". 3: at the end of the convo, I asked her ""Maybe we just need to give it some time"" and she replied ""yes, that actually sounds great"".  (maybe this is all cope).  
  
 She then leaves for Europe on an exchange trip, for 3 weeks, and i dont say a word to her during it. The day she arrives back home, she asks me out of the blue ""hey, how've you been"". and then SHE asks ME if we want to catch up for coffee. I say sure, and it starts up again. its been 4 weeks since shes back, and we've had coffee every week. In all of our coffee chats, i show her magic (she loves it), she always seems to laugh and engage the conversation, and we talk for around 2 - 3 hours per session (we studied together last time). Maybe this is a sign, or maybe shes super friendly to everyone. 

Now Im a bit confused. Maybe she was just trying to be nice to me or let me down slowly, but I really like this girl. Maybe she doesn't want a younger guy, maybe she doesn't like the way I look, or maybe she just wants to focus on herself for now. Im afraid to ask her the date question again, because once i do ill know for certain whether i should keep investing as much time into this as i should, or dream of things that might not come true. I have my own things to focus on, and I'm happy with where im at right now (ie, i dont NEED a girlfriend because i feel like im lonely, i just really like this girl). So based on the signs, is it time to stop coping and move on, or is there potentially something there, or do I end it all and ask the question again. I just dont wanna be living in the fog, nor do I want to cut off connection (shes still a great friend). Thanks guys!",1,1757937898.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I live a small life with this person, snapshots of ordinary and happy times. Having coffee at the kitchen table in the morning sun, walking through town together hand-in-hand, joking and playing all along. We even have a few arguments, but even those are done out of love.

There is almost never anything sexual, we might be laying in bed exhanging soft smiles, or showering together. But all I am feeling is love, the comfort of sharing your life with another who loves you. 



Then I wake up, usually abruptly, in the middle of this false life. And the feeling of emptiness is profound, the pain is only slight and bitter. But the emptiness is like a wide arid plain inside of me. I do not cry, because I have no tears, I am empty.

My boyfriend (22) and I (20F) have been together for 2.5 years. When we got together things were going really well. We both had visions for our futures and our finances were completely separate.

He moved in with me and my family (mom, stepdad, and 2 little brothers) very quickly. It did not happen on purpose, one sleepover turned into him living with us. He didn't pay any living expenses for 2 years. No rent, barely paid for this own food, and didn't really help around the house at all. My family had no idea how to bring up him paying for stuff, especially rent. We ended up having to move and now he's paying rent because we simply could not afford for him not too.

He does full time tree work and I work full time EMS and I'm in school. He makes more than me but I pay for more of our necessities. I came home one morning after working a 24, to condom wrappers on my bed. His excuse was jacking off and not wanting to clean up the mess after. A lot of people told me that he's probably cheating on me but I didn't have any real proof so I stayed with him. Im starting to think that maybe I should break up with him and I'm seeing a lot of red flags from the past two years that I completely ignored. He has his body count tattooed in tally marks on his leg, he's a borderline alcoholic, video games tend to come before me, we got a dog and he honestly treats my dog like shit. My mom keeps saying he's a good guy and that I should give him more chances. But I feel so much more like an adult than him despite being younger with less life experience. I'm really not sure what to do. 

He has his good moments that make me feel like maybe he isn't too far gone. He opens doors for me, makes me coffee in the morning sometimes. But it feels more like we're roomates than partners.

I desperately need someone to talk some sense into me before we move again. For some reason I feel like I can't break up with him.

TL:DR: I can't decide if I want to break up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years because the good moments occasionally feel like they outweigh the bad. ",3,1757937753.0,Advice,7,0.8,False

1nhjr4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nhjr4i/reveal_the_truth_behind_rella_laundry_detergent/,Reveal the Truth Behind Rella Laundry Detergent Sheets Benefits,"**Testing the Rella Powerful Laundry Detergent Sheets**

Ever struggled with heavy detergent bottles or the mess that regular liquid detergents can leave behind? That's precisely why I decided to try the Rella Powerful Laundry Detergent Sheets, and I must admit, it‚Äôs been an interesting experience. Boasting features like eco-friendliness, a fresh linen scent, and up to 120 loads from one compact package, these sheets promise convenience and efficiency. But do they deliver? Let me walk you through my honest experience with them.

**Eco-Conscious and Space-Saving Design**

These detergent sheets are a dream for anyone looking to ditch bulky packaging and reduce plastic waste. The compact size of the box was the first thing that caught my eye. Measuring just 8.11 x 5.28 x 1.69 inches, the slim, lightweight box fits easily in my laundry cabinet, which is a welcome change from trying to cram oversized jugs into a limited space. For those who prioritize sustainable living, the biodegradable nature of these sheets makes them a fantastic addition to an eco-friendly household.

If you're like me, trying to make your home greener step by step, these sheets will feel like a win. The packaging has no plastic, making this a zero-waste product. Of course, this quality added a layer of satisfaction to every use, knowing I wasn‚Äôt contributing to landfills with yet another empty jug.

**Ease of Use and Practicality**

Using these sheets couldn‚Äôt be simpler. There's no need to measure or worry about spills. I just grabbed a single sheet, tossed it into the washing machine, and carried on with my day. Not having to fumble with caps or pour detergent was a surprising game-changer. Even my teenage kids, who are notorious for doing laundry halfway, managed to use these without any hiccups.

Another standout feature was how well the detergent sheets dissolved in both hot and cold water. I tested it on several occasions with different temperatures, and not once did I find remnants of the sheet in the washer. They simply melted away, leaving no mess behind.

**Impressive Stain Removal**

The promise of a high-quality clean with minimal effort had me skeptical at first. However, after putting these sheets through the wringer on my kids‚Äô grass-stained shorts and my partner‚Äôs coffee-streaked shirts, I was genuinely impressed at how effective they were. The sheets lifted tough stains and left clothes looking brighter than expected. Whites were noticeably less dingy, and in general, the laundry had that ‚Äújust-cleaned‚Äù crisp factor.

**Fresh Linen Scent Without Being Overpowering**

One thing I loved was the mild yet refreshing fresh linen scent. Unlike some detergents that leave an overwhelming fragrance clinging to clothes for days, these sheets imparted just the right hint of freshness. It‚Äôs subtle but long-lasting, making it perfect for those who prefer a balanced aroma that doesn‚Äôt compete with their perfume or cologne.

**Target Users and Travel-Friendly Nature**

These laundry sheets are a godsend for travelers, college students, or anyone short on storage space. I took them along for a weekend trip, and they packed beautifully in my suitcase without adding any weight. No messy liquid to worry about spilling‚Äîjust grab a few sheets and go. This feature makes them especially relevant for dorm dwellers who need practical, lightweight laundry solutions that don‚Äôt take up precious space.

**Good Points**

- No measuring, spills, or plastic waste  
- Compact and travel-friendly packaging  
- Gentle yet effective stain removal  
- Biodegradable and eco-conscious  
- Subtle, appealing fresh linen scent  

**Areas of Concern**

- The detergent struggled a bit with heavily soiled items like muddy sports jerseys. A booster or pre-treatment was necessary in these cases.  
- While suitable for everyday laundry, households with particularly messy toddlers or frequent deep cleaning needs might want a stronger product for those specific loads.  
- The sheets feel almost too lightweight, making it easy to accidentally pull out extra sheets at times.

**Competing Products**

In the world of detergent alternatives, there‚Äôs no shortage of options. Brands like Earth Breeze and Tru Earth compete with similar eco-friendly laundry strip products. Compared to Rella‚Äôs offering, competitors often emphasize even lighter packaging or subscription models. However, Rella Laundry Sheets stand out for their affordability and fresh linen scent, which some competitors lack. Another notable difference is the sheet thickness‚Äîwhile some brands use thinner sheets that can sometimes tear during handling, Rella's sheets maintained durability throughout use.

On the other hand, traditional liquid detergents provide stronger cleaning power for heavily soiled clothes but come at the cost of higher plastic usage and less convenience. For anyone prioritizing eco-friendliness and portability, Rella‚Äôs detergent sheets shine brighter.

**Affordable Quality**

Balancing its eco-conscious features with ease of use and effectiveness, the cost-to-benefit ratio feels worthwhile. Considering it offers up to 120 loads per box, the price per load is highly competitive. While it may not completely replace heavy-duty cleaners for families with frequent deep-clean needs, it‚Äôs more than adequate for day-to-day laundry. For those aiming to invest in greener household products without stretching their budget, these laundry sheets represent smart spending.

The post was a flicker of a thought, a fleeting wish tossed into the vast digital ocean of Weverse. ""***In another life***,"" the anonymous fan had written, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. ""***I will treat you to a coffee shop.***"" Her bias was Ahyeon, but this message felt different, a quiet, wistful note to the universe itself.



The reply came hours later, a notification that made her heart leap. The name was Asa.



**Asa: ""A coffee shop? What would you order?""**



It was the beginning of a quiet, almost secret exchange buried in the mountain of other fan posts. They talked about simple things: the weather in Seoul, favorite books, and the quiet comfort of a rainy day. There were no grand declarations, no romantic gestures. It was just two people‚Äîone a global idol, the other a student who found peace in libraries‚Äîfinding a shared moment in a world that was often loud and demanding.



Then, one day, the illusion of ""another life"" shattered. Asa posted a message on her personal feed that made the fan's heart stop.



Asa: ""My schedule has a small, unexpected gap next Tuesday. I'll be in the Hongdae area. If you still want that coffee...""



It wasn't a direct invitation, not explicitly to her. But the fan knew. The reference to ""that coffee"" was unmistakable. Her mind instantly went into overdrive. Hongdae. Next Tuesday. It was real.



Panic set in. The security, the public, the sheer impossibility of it. The fan typed a dozen replies, deleting each one. She finally settled on a simple, hesitant message.



Fan: ""I... I don't know if I can.""



Asa's reply came quickly, reassuring and thoughtful.



Asa: ""It's okay if you can't. No pressure. But if you do, there's a small, quiet cafe near the art street. It has a red awning. I'll be there around 3 PM, for an hour. Just me. No staff, no fuss. Just a coffee.""



The weight of the responsibility was immense. One wrong move, one leaked photo, and it could be disastrous for Asa. For the next few days, her life revolved around ""next Tuesday."" Her biggest fear was being recognized as the ""Weverse fan"" and drawing unwanted attention.



The day arrived, crisp and clear. As she made her way through the bustling streets of Hongdae, her heart hammered against her ribs. She spotted the red awning and, taking a deep breath, pushed open the door.



And there she was. Asa. Sitting at a small table near the window, a book open in front of her, sipping from a white mug. She wore a simple baseball cap pulled low, and a plain, oversized hoodie. She looked... normal.



Asa looked up as the bell above the door chimed. Her eyes, usually so sharp and stage-ready, softened as they met the fan's. A small, genuine smile touched her lips. She gestured to the empty seat opposite her.



""Caramel macchiato, right?"" Asa asked, her voice just as gentle as it was in her Weverse messages. ""I already ordered one for you.""



The fan felt a wave of relief so potent it almost brought tears to her eyes. She sat down, her hands wrapped around the warm mug.



""It's perfect. Exactly how I like it,"" the fan said, a blush creeping up her cheeks. ""Did you... really remember?""



""I have a good memory,"" Asa replied, setting her mug down. ""And you mentioned it so specifically. It's the little details you notice on Weverse. It makes the posts feel real, you know? Not just... noise.""



The fan nodded, feeling a wave of relief. She wasn't just another face in the crowd. She finally felt brave enough to ask something that had been on her mind for months.



""Can I ask you something personal? Not about music or anything.""



""Go ahead.""



""How... how do you stay grounded? With everything. The pressure, the schedules... all of it.""



Asa looked out the window, her expression thoughtful. ""I don't know if I always do. But little things help. A good song, a rainy day... and the conversations I have with my members. And... I guess, the conversations I have with people like you. They remind me that there's a whole world outside of what's expected of me. That people are just... people. It's a good reminder.""



She turned her gaze back to the fan. ""And what about you? What do you do? I've been so curious.""



The fan laughed softly. ""Me? I'm just a student. I spend a lot of time in libraries. It's a lot like this, actually. Quiet. Peaceful.""



""That makes sense. It fits the feeling of your posts.""



***For that brief hour, in a small cafe in Hongdae, the lines between idol and fan, stranger and friend, simply disappeared. It was just two people, sharing a quiet moment and a promise fulfilled. And in that small, unassuming space, the ""another life"" became this life, and their friendship solidified into something wonderfully, genuinely real.***",1,1757936879.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

1nhjk3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/1nhjk3t/why_tvs_dont_have_displayport_hdmi_21_is_closed/,"Why TVs don't have DisplayPort, HDMI 2.1 is closed, and consumers are lied to, and what to do about it","It‚Äôs wild how many people don‚Äôt grasp the absurdity of the current display tech situation. I'm a tech and Open Source enthusiast who used to work for Toshiba as a marketing strategy specialist, and I can't stand what's being done to the display market any more. Why do we agree to this artificial market segmentation? We're being tricked for profit and somehow let the big electronic brands get away with it. It's **insane consumer behaviour**. I'll oversimplify some aspects, but the main take is this: whenever you're buying a TV, ask about DisplayPort input (only ask, I'm not trying to influence your buying strategy, but **please** ask ‚Äì make them sweat explaining **why**).

**TL;DR:** EU forced Apple to include USB-C. Big TV brands are Apple, DisplayPort is USB-C port, and VESA+customers are EU. It's time we force-equalise TV and monitor markets. Otherwise, big brands will keep selling the same screens in monitors for 2x the price, and DisplayPort is the only remaining equalising factor.

**HDMI vs DisplayPort ‚Äì skip if you understand the difference and licensing:**

You need HDMI 2.1 (relatively fresh tech, \~3 years old) to get VRR, HDR, and 4K+ res at more than 60 Hz over HDMI. But it's a closed protocol, and implementing it requires buying a licence. Licences are handled by big TV brands (HDMI Forum and HDMI LA), who don't sell any for 2.1+ protocol if you plan on using them in Open Source software ‚Äì AMD fought to buy one for over 2 years and failed despite spending millions. This could be expected, because the competition could sniff out details of HDMI 2.1 from their open source driver, and release a better product, right? But here comes the kicker: a better solution was already implemented, and not by the competition, but on their own turf ‚Äì VESA, a body responsible for visual display standards, independently released DisplayPort.

DisplayPort was already as capable as the newest HDMI protocol when it was version 1.4, and we now have 16k capable DisplayPort 2.1 (and soon a 32k one), which surpasses the needs of currently sold home devices‚Ä¶ by **far**. Why? Because NEC knew standardisation wouldn't work if it had to answer to TV brands, so it started VESA as an independent non-profit. VESA doesn't care how future-proof standards influence the market. Doesn't care about separating TV and monitor markets. It deals with both in the same manner because these are the same devices!

**Nowadays, TVs and monitors are the same tech, coming from the same production lines, but monitors are 2x the price ‚Äì here's how:**

PC monitors market is a huge source of income, but only for as long as manufacturers can price them at 2x the price of a similar TV. It's possible because their customers keep believing these are separate devices. They use 4 strategies to sustain that belief:

1. the false notion of TV inferiority
2. surrounding tech marketing fluff
3. forced cognitive dissonance / misinformation / embargos
4. licensing / incompatibility / niche lock-in

**TV vs monitor screens:**

It used to be that TV screens were indeed inferior to PC monitor screens, because they weren't typically used from the same distance, so TVs could get away with far worse viewing angles, picture clarity, distorted colours, etc. And therefore, content providers could cut corners on things like bandwidth, and deliver an overall lower quality signal. This in turn spawned a whole market around all those proprietary sound and image improving techs (a.k.a. DolbyWhatever‚Ñ¢) that used to have their place with signals received over antenna, cable, and satellite TV (and became a selling point for some devices). People, wake up! That was in the 90s! These fluff technologies were never needed for things like PCs, consoles, camcorders, phones (and are no longer needed for modern TV signal either) that all can handle pristine digital image and sound. Current TVs don't get different display hardware, either ‚Äì it's not commercially viable to maintain separate factory lines (for TVs and for monitors) when the same line can make screens for both, and the console market dictates very similar display requirements for TVs anyway. What's more, the newer tech means cheaper and more efficient production process, so even more savings!

So how do they keep that notion of display inferiority alive? They *hold back* the product. Literally, the portion of produced screens is stored for a few years before going into TVs. When you dismantle a brand-new TV (dated 2025), there's a non-zero chance of finding a 2022 or even 2020 production date on the display inside ‚Äì that's the only reason it has lower detail density (PPI / DPI), and a bit worse viewing angles or input lag. Because, again, for as long as they keep the TVs slightly inferior, they get to sell the same hardware in monitors for 2x the price.

**DolbyWhatever‚Ñ¢ and marketing fluff:**

The surrounding tech, all the DolbyWhatever‚Ñ¢, is outdated on its own, as it comes from a long forgotten era of VHS tapes, when videos were stored on slowly degrading magnetised media and required tech to overcome that degradation. When VHS died, they've adapted to analogue TV‚Ä¶ But TV isn't analogue any more, and doesn't need them either ‚Äì digital signals (aside from non-significant edge cases) aren't prone to degradation. **But consumers still fall for the marketing fluff built around it.** Let's stop this already! These technologies are easily replaceable and have minimal value! Indistinguishable effects are available with software that can be installed by the manufacturer on any smart TV. There's no need for dedicated, proprietary chips!

**Misinformation and embargo strategies:**

How are customers kept in the dark? All big tech media have to run their reviews and articles by the manufacturer's marketing team, or they get blacklisted and won't receive review models in the future from any single one of them. All hardware manufacturers (including consoles and phones) are required to follow big brands' requirements, or they get shadowbanned on future contracts and licence sales. TV distributors people are **forbidden** to even mention Open Source compatibility, Linux, macOS, Android (as in: connect your phone to TV) when they're trained. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are forced to license their closed Windows drivers, and **required to closely guard** the HDMI 2.1 protocol details behind ridiculous encryptions. But even that slowly fails, due to the rise of independent media and electronics manufacturers. That leaves the last viable strategy: DisplayPort scarcity / HDMI niche lock-in.

**HDMI licensing and consequences of DisplayPort:**

Even though big brands sell \~3x more TVs than PC monitors (TV sales reaching almost 200 million units in 2023 compared to around 70 million monitors), the monitor market has a way higher potential (TV companies earn ‚Ç¨80-90 billion from TV-related sales yearly, that includes \~‚Ç¨5 billion in HDMI licensing and royalties, against \~‚Ç¨40 billion from monitor sales, despite selling 3x fewer units). It's a wet dream of any display brand to sell all their hardware exclusively as expensive PC monitors. They need to that market separation, we don't.

Imagine some governing body suddenly mandates all new TVs to include DisplayPort (or modern HDMI gets spontaneously open sourced, which'll never happen, but the outcome would be the same). Suddenly, the PC consumers have a choice between monitors and comparable TVs at half the price. And choosing TV over a monitor means they get a free tuner, a self-sustained Android device, remote control, voice control, don't need smart speakers for their home devices (TVs have Google Assistant), don't need recorders (PCs can do that), TV keyboards, sound bars, etc.

Not only that, but non-affiliate hardware manufacturers (Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Nintendo, cable converter and adapter vendors, Raspberry Pi and other SBC) and big screen providers (think Jumbotron) have literally zero-reason to buy HDMI licence, or include HDMI port on their devices at all (other than compatibility, but they don't want compatibility ‚Äì they want you to buy a new device). And no licence cost means they could potentially lower their prices to increase their attractiveness, and they **would** want to do that because the joined market just got more competitive. How low? Well, let's see.

The joined market would have to adapt: PC monitors would have to go cheaper to compete with TVs, and the TVs would have to get modern screens to win over competitors‚Ä¶ So they'd become one and the same device, priced somewhere in the middle. Imagine a newer monitor being cheaper on release than the old model ‚Äì wow, I want that future!. DolbyWhatever‚Ñ¢ would die. The typical TV consumer wouldn't lose any sleep over it, because they'd just buy a 3‚Äì5 years old device (most probably with a hefty discount). And whoever required a new screen for something more than just TV ‚Äì gaming, professional animation, graphics ‚Äì would order a brand-new device. But the total market value would drop by over 30%. That means less money for big brands, but cheaper tech for the end-user. Let's become those end-users.

**There's nothing more to it ‚Äì that's the bottom line:**

Companies keep selling incompatible hardware for as long as people keep buying it, because they want the sunk cost fallacy, so that whenever the customer decides to ‚Äújump the market‚Äù (i.e. become an early adopter of a better tech), they'd have to upgrade their entire hardware chain. I was forced to use this s*tatus quo bias* against our customers for years. But this doesn't have to be the case! Big brands are already prepared to add DisplayPort and rebrand their TVs as monitors (or hybrids) with minimal cost and effort, if (or when) the market demand ever rises. It's currently estimated to happen within the next 10 years (as early as 2028 according to some overzealous reports) due to fall of TV and rise of independent content providers (like Netflix, YouTube, HBO, Disney), but the industry had similar estimates predicting it would've happened 5‚Äì10 years ago, and it never did! We ‚Äì the customers ‚Äì don't have to be slaves to this self-inflicted *loss aversion*. We don't have to keep getting tricked into accepting the same hardware with a higher price tag for PCs, just because they tell us TVs don't need modern inputs, and devices don't need modern outputs. This is madness! So let's stop losing this zero-sum game, and start demanding DisplayPort and USB-C. Let's force their hand already!

**Why the frustration:**

Many years ago I put Linux on all PCs in my family, so I didn't had to maintain them any more. It worked. Until today, when my cousin asked me to connect a TV to her brand new RX 7900 XTX GPU for big-screen gaming. Also, I had too much coffee and needed to vent. But yeah, I'll solve that with a 3rd party DP -> HDMI adapter.",10,1757936705.0,Monitors,7,0.81,False

Over the past 15 years, I've developed what I call my ""productivity blueprint."" These aren't revolutionary concepts, just practical principles that have helped me get more done while staying sane.

Here's my 8-point system:

1. Start Before You're Ready: Don't wait for perfect conditions or complete knowledge. The best time to start is now, even if you're only 70% prepared. Momentum builds clarity faster than planning ever will.
2. Batch Similar Tasks: Group related activities together instead of jumping between different types of work. Answer all emails at once, make all your calls in one block, do all your creative work during your peak energy hours.
3. Two-Minute Rule: If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to your to-do list, don't schedule it for later. This prevents small tasks from snowballing into overwhelming piles.
4. Know Your Peak Hours: Everyone has natural energy rhythms. I do my hardest work between 8-11 AM when my brain is sharpest. Schedule your most important tasks during your biological prime time, not just when it's convenient.
5. Single-Task Like Your Life Depends on It: Multitasking is a myth that makes you less productive, not more. Focus on one thing at a time, finish it, then move to the next. Your brain will thank you with better quality work.
6. Build Systems, Not Goals: Goals tell you what you want; systems tell you how to get there. Instead of ""write a book,"" create a system: ""write 300 words every morning before coffee."" Systems run on autopilot once established.
7. Protect Your Input: Be ruthless about what you consume. Limit news, social media, and negative content. Your mind processes everything you feed it, so choose high-quality inputs if you want high-quality outputs.
8. Weekly Reviews Are Non-Negotiable: Every Sunday, spend 20 minutes reviewing what worked, what didn't, and what needs adjustment. This prevents you from repeating mistakes and helps you course-correct quickly.

These aren't groundbreaking ideas, but applying them consistently has transformed how much I accomplish without burning out.

But five years ago, I found a reliable remedy for it.

Nine months ago, my medication was changed so that I was given Aripiprazole instead of Cariprazine. Since then, along with lamotrigine and escitalopram, my DPDR has improved significantly, although some residual symptoms remain. Five years ago, I drank a sweetened caf√© au lait for the first time in a long time. One cup. To my astonishment, something happened: the depression disappeared for the duration of the coffee's effects. At first, I thought it was my imagination and tried it again a day later. The effect was reproducible. Just a moment ago, I was suffering from a depressive phase (these phases usually last a few hours for me); it was almost unbearable. I just made myself another coffee. And now the depression is gone.  Although the DPDR doesn't react to caffeine in terms of visual perception regarding spatial vision (it has improved consistently with the medications described), the feelings are as if they're swapped. Above all, the feeling of being ""dead,"" which, combined with the DPDR, can be frightening when hiking through dark woods, disappears.

However, if I drink more than a small amount of coffee, it turns into restlessness and anxiety. Tremors and cravings can also occur. ‚Äì From time to time, however, the coffee is a kind of ""on-demand medication."" In the past, I was prescribed fast-acting on-demand medications for crises, primarily Promethazine, Dipiperone, Truxal, but also, rarely in hospitals, Tavor for a short time.

The former are low-potency neuroleptics, Tavor a benzodiazepine. They were primarily intended to balance negative feelings and thoughts. This hardly helped at all. When I discovered the coffee, things changed. ‚Äì I'm just looking out the window, and everything seems brighter, friendlier, and more pleasant.  This also influences the feelings of DPDR.

My experiences with tea and dark chocolate, which also have an activating effect, were less positive. Green or black tea gives me anxiety and a mild headache. Dark chocolate can cause restlessness and insomnia for many hours.

Finally, it should be said that the amount of coffee should be very limited. Not every day, and only one cup. The effects last for several hours.",1,1757936411.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

I've been a huge hot chocolate enthusiast for years, and I noticed there's a lot of confusion about hot chocolate makers versus frothers. After trying both, I thought I'd share my experience to help you make the right choice.

First off, let's get something straight - while both devices can make hot chocolate, they work quite differently. A hot chocolate maker is specifically designed to heat and mix hot chocolate to perfection. It's like having a mini barista dedicated just to making that perfect cup of cocoa. I recently got one (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker), and it's completely changed my hot chocolate game.

The main difference is that a hot chocolate maker has a heating element and special mixing mechanisms designed to melt chocolate properly and combine it with milk. It maintains the perfect temperature throughout the process, preventing that annoying scalded milk taste or chocolate clumps at the bottom.

Frothers, on the other hand, are primarily designed to create foam. While they can mix hot chocolate, they usually don't heat the liquid - you'll need to do that separately. They're great for making foam for cappuccinos or adding a nice frothy top to your drinks, but they're not specialized for hot chocolate.

Here's what really sets hot chocolate makers apart:
- Temperature control
- Even chocolate distribution
- No manual heating required
- Usually larger capacity
- Some models have multiple settings

I noticed a huge difference in taste when using a proper hot chocolate maker. The chocolate melts completely, creating this smooth, rich texture that's hard to achieve with a frother. If you're serious about your hot chocolate (like me!), I'd definitely recommend getting a dedicated hot chocolate maker (here's that link again: https://athometouch.com/hot-chocolate-maker).

One thing I love about my hot chocolate maker is how it handles different types of chocolate - whether I'm using powder, chips, or chunks, it melts everything perfectly. With a frother, I often ended up with unmelted bits at the bottom.

That said, if you're just looking to add some froth to pre-made hot chocolate or mainly make coffee drinks, a frother might be sufficient. But for true hot chocolate lovers who want that cafe-quality experience at home, a hot chocolate maker is definitely worth the investment.

The New York Yankees (83-65) roll into Target Field Monday night as -189 favorites against the Minnesota Twins (65-84), a team that‚Äôs been underdogs so often this season, they‚Äôve probably forgotten what it‚Äôs like to wear a crown. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a umpire‚Äôs strike zone and the humor of a ballpark hot dog vendor who‚Äôs seen it all.

### Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Lie (Unless It‚Äôs the Twins‚Äô ERA)

The Yankees‚Äô implied win probability of 65.5% (based on -189 odds) screams ‚Äúfavorites,‚Äù while the Twins‚Äô 39.2% (from +156) feels like the odds of your Uncle Bob hitting a home run after three beers. Statistically, New York‚Äôs offense is a well-oiled batting cage: 5.2 runs per game, 251 home runs (1.7 per game), and a .250 batting average. Their pitching staff? A 3.99 ERA and a WHIP of 1.267‚Äîthink of it as a tightrope walker balancing on a unicycle.

The Twins, meanwhile, are the baseball equivalent of a leaky faucet. Their 4.62 ERA (24th in MLB) and .239 batting average (22nd) suggest they‚Äôre fighting an uphill battle. Sure, they‚Äôve hit 178 home runs (11th in the league), but their starting pitcher, Simeon Woods-Richardson, has a 4.58 ERA. Compare that to Carlos Rod√≥n, the Yankees‚Äô ace, who‚Äôs posted a 3.11 ERA and 186 strikeouts in 176 innings‚Äîlike a human octopus with a radar gun.

Hey there :)
I‚Äôm 24, just moved to Mumbai, and trying to settle into this chaotic, charming city. Tall (6'3""), working in consulting, and hoping to meet someone I can share some genuine vibes with, no pressure, just seeing where it goes.

I‚Äôm into reading (mostly fiction and philosophy), love cooking when I have the time, and spend way too long picking caf√©s with the right kind of lighting and coffee. Museums, walking aimlessly in new neighbourhoods, and long, unfiltered conversations are my idea of fun. I enjoy exploring the kinkier side of life too, but always with respect, communication, and clear consent.

If you're someone who enjoys thoughtful chats, slow-burn chemistry, spontaneous plans, and you‚Äôre open to something that‚Äôs honest and fun, drop me a message. Happy to share pics and continue the chat once we find some common spark :)",0,1757936010.0,RelationshipIndia,5,0.33,False

Here it is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
_________________________
Source(s):
every `1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1757935631.0,LostInventions,0,1.0,False

1nhj3zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistaniiConfessions/comments/1nhj3zu/messy_inlaw_situation/,Messy inlaw situation,"Hey y‚Äôall. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 


I (early 20s F) married my husband (late 20s) 3 months ago. Although he‚Äôs a good husband, his family (mom, younger sister, and elder sister who‚Äôs married but visits every other day) is not that nice to me anymore. 


I made some mistakes in the beginning of our relationship. I tried leaving a few times, over heated arguments with my husband. I got scared, and acted immaturely. I understand now, that kuch bhi hojae, itna acha shohar nhi chorna kabhi. I love him too much to leave, ever. 


Ever since the last fight, I‚Äôve become a different person naturally. I‚Äôve taken over home chores, i learn and i practice. I‚Äôve become entirely comfortable here. 


I always thought i got blessed with a great MIL. She‚Äôs educated, has trauma from her saas that she claims she doesn‚Äôt want to pass down generations, teaches me how to do stuff, and even tells my husband to take care of me. 


The door to her room is right next to the sofas outside in the living room. She doesn‚Äôt always notice im sitting outside, so I‚Äôve heard her talk to the maids about me a few times. Telling them to stay away from me, or else. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, though. Cause hey, if she‚Äôs nice to me to my face, I‚Äôm fine with that. 



I found out im pregnant, and husband and i were so happy. My MIL told my elder SIL and she was visibly not excited or happy. Honestly, i dont care, i didn‚Äôt care then either. 


Then they had a fight about something completely different, where somehow my name got dragged into the fight by elder sil, and she talked maddd crap about me to my husband. My husband luckily defended me, and made it clear that she does not hold authority to discuss me in any way. They also confessed during the fight, that they were infact, not happy with our pregnancy. 



Then i miscarried. 



During my early term miscarriage, i heard her talking to my younger sis in law (she‚Äôs the youngest of all siblings, and younger than me by a year) about how it‚Äôs all a drama, and that women go through it all the time, and that I‚Äôm depressed as if i lost a full term child. Shes glad we‚Äôre not having a baby, because her elder daughter is (InshaAllah) having a baby, and that she wants to pamper her, and her alone. It broke my heart, but i kept quiet. I forgave and forgot. I have my parents and husband to be happy for me, and sad for me. It‚Äôs fine. 



Ever since then, i made it a goal to become closer with my mil. I began giving kisses on her cheeks, taking care of her meds, breakfast waghera. Dil se, i started worrying for her alot more. Everybody noticed the change in my behaviour and the efforts i was making. She did too, and i was happy things were getting better. 


My elder SIL comes over every other day or so, and when she does, she visibly gets annoyed by my presence. I try not to think much about it. She comes after work, so i just assume it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs tired. I try talking to her, and she only has her one word replies, that‚Äôs fine too. I initiate convo, if she doesn‚Äôt want to, she doesn‚Äôt have to. I have caught my SILs saying my name in a low tone and changing the subject a few times, but i cba since it‚Äôs not to me, directly, or harming me or my relationship with my husband. 


Now here‚Äôs where the main concern comes in. Since the day we got married, my husband told me to keep my distance with my younger SIL. Never told me why. Just told me not to validate her, and to keep boundaries. I tried my best to treat her as a younger sister, since she‚Äôs much younger by relation, even if not by age. She shared some stuff with me, and i tried being a good elder sister figure, and gave her the advice my husband would‚Äôve wanted me to. She however, has a hard time treating me like an elder sister. We Ofcourse joke around, but she takes it too far. She sometimes get physical also, hitting around and stuff. Ehh. I‚Äôve told her to stop but she thinks im joking each time, but she does have ADHD, so i tried being a little more serious the last time it happened. She will usually be friendly, asking me for help with stuff (ie bhabhi ye jora istree nhi krna ata, krdein. Bhabhi apke hath ki coffee achi lgti, bana dein, etc) tells me not to tell my husband, though. I don‚Äôt mind, honestly. I treated her like a younger sister, i dont mind taking care of her sometimes like one too. Her good behaviour lasts until we have company. Mil has a friend that comes over often, accompanied by her daughter, who my sil is great friends with. Sil talks to me like I‚Äôm a huge burden on her shoulders, when that friend is around. She will click her lips when i walk into the room they‚Äôre in (kitchen/ living room), she‚Äôll just say random things that are so rude, especially to say to your bhabhi infront of guests. She also starts getting hyper and starts repeating ‚ÄúBHABHI AISE NHI KRNA/ KRTE, Aise krte hain‚Äù when its literally the same thing we‚Äôre both doing. Or its something my mil told me to do this way. I stay quiet each time, because we have company over. I know my husband would tell me to speak up right then and there, but i know that would cause such embarrassing drama in the house, more stress for him to come home to. So i avoid being in the same place with them alone. 



She also has a habit of slamming stuff, whenever shes mad. If her mother scolds her, she will join me, usually in the kitchen or living room, where she starts slamming stuff. And if i ask her to pass me something in the kitchen, she either wont respond, or she‚Äôll slam it. 


She also has developed a habit of keeping an eye on my phone screen. I dont know why, but she just has. Especially if its a text from my husband. She then tries to deny it, but ive caught her looking directly at the messages from the lockscreen, while my phone was on the kitchen counter and she thought i wasnt looking. I‚Äôve caught her looking into my phone while im using it several times, too. 


She tells her mother exaggerated x10 versions of everything. For no reason at all. Every single time, i have to interrupt and tell mil that what she‚Äôs telling is 10x exaggerated version of what actually is going on. 




My mil thinks i tell my husband everything, ive heard her tell the maid that i do, but if i were to do that, the house would be a mess. There would be constant fights. I dont want that, so i keep quiet. I do not tell him or show anything at ALL. 


My mil and husband had a fight a few days ago, and my sil told me yesterday that my mil is about to give my husband‚Äôs cat up for adoption. I insisted she convinces mil either not to do it, or atleast talk to my husband about it first. My husband raised that cat, he loves him like a child. He would crash out if he comes home one day to find out his cat is gone. Sil said she‚Äôs siding with her mother, and that i can tell my husband if i want to. I already get accused of telling my husband everything, so i told her i would absolutely not do that. She kept insisting weirdly, as if she wants me to go tell him. I did not tell my husband, because i know that would cause a huge fight, and during it he would be asked how he knows, to which he would tell her i told him. That would solidify the accusation against me. Plus, i dont think mil would actually give the cat away, since she loves him alot too. It was probably just something she‚Äôs saying out of anger. She has put his pictures up in groups and all, but i dont think she‚Äôd go through with it, so kya faida‚Ä¶ beghair waja larai hojaegi. 



As a result of everything, I‚Äôve started being a little distant with my sil, but that leaves me in awkwardness kyunk kitchen waghera mein wo sath hi hoti hai, tou its awkward shutting her jokes down. 



What do i do? I dont want fights in the house, but i also dont want to be treated this way. Ghar aise toot jate hain. Honestly mere peeche jisko jo bat krni (except my husband), wo kren. Just treat me fine, and I‚Äôll be a good addition to the family, dil se. I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúmove out, live alone‚Äù advice. We can‚Äôt do that. My husband is my mils only son. I‚Äôm not itni pathar dil. I want to stay together as a family, a HAPPY, HEALTHY one.

1nhj3yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1nhj3yo/im_so_tiredday_19/,I'm so tired...(day 19),"I'm 46M, first started drinking coffee when I was 4 or 5 years old. Only one cup a day, with milk. Family praised me, that I was taking after my grandfather (who I'm named after and drank 20+ cups a day). I quit after a year or so, then got back on it when I was around 15. Have been drinking coffee ever since, with multiple attempts to quit in recent years.

Up until about 10 years ago, I'd say I drank 3 cappuccinos in the morning and an espresso after lunch. I had a stressful job, would always take me at least an hour to fall asleep. Which I blamed 100% on the job, not on the coffee. Because hey, everyone drinks coffee, right? I didn't even question it.

About 10 years ago, I realized I'm lactose intolerant, I'd be on the toilet 30 mins after that first cappuccino and let's just say it wasn't solid. Finally the light bulb went off, what if I drink it black? Switched to espresso, later long blacks, and even later filter coffee (Aeropress). That solved that problem. I also limited my consumption to 2 coffees a day.

Two years ago, I got really sick for 2 weeks. Once I got better, I kept having belly pain. Initially misdiagnosed, I eventually had an endoscopy and was diagnosed with chronic gastritis. To heal that, it's best to quit caffeine (also alcohol, acidic fruits, etc). Adjusting to a new diet has been mostly doable, but I've had the hardest time with giving up coffee.

I tried multiple times, but eventually always got back on the juice. Even though I limited it to one cappuccino with almond milk, after breakfast. So over the summer, I was back on 1 cappuccino a day for about two months. It started when I had to begin taking medication for pollen allergy and I felt tired all the time. And then I just kept drinking the daily coffee after I quit the meds.

Almost 3 weeks ago (day 19 now), I started another attempt to quit caffeine. My belly pain had worsened and I'm about to go on a month long trip, early October. I'm really worried that I won't be fit enough for that and may want to cut it short. Also, I was noticing more and more anxiety, to the point that I felt the onset of panic attacks, not caused by any specific cause other than my mind spiraling out of control.

Week 1 was the now familiar withdrawal symptoms: headache, fatigue, depression, lack of drive. On day 4, my belly pain actually worsened (let's say 5 out of 10). Took a long bath, used a heating pad for days. After about a week, it had all subsided back to my usual discomfort level (2 out of 10). Anxiety is also lower, but not gone.

But man...I'm SO TIRED all the time.

I sleep 9 hours a night, have had to take a nap almost every day since I quit, then I'm yawning in the evening again. Headaches are gone, but I feel moody, depressed even, I've got ZERO DRIVE to do anything (I hardly get any work done), my joints ache. It's frustrating, especially when I read here on /decaf that people still feel this lack of drive one year after they quit...

I'm convinced that quitting coffee is good for my gut. And I want to keep it up this time. I'm eating pretty healthy. Also, I walk for an hour every morning outside + I do cardio 4-5/times a week. But life just feels like it's passing me by in a haze. When I'm on my walk, I put one foot after the other somehow, but it's like I'm not really there. I just did a cardio, and in the last bit, I just felt like closing my eyes and falling over on a mattress (which unfortunately wasn't right next to me).

They explained with ADHD:

* Emotions often arrive late and then hit hard.
* We miss the early signals until they‚Äôre already flooding in.
* So we avoid or distract ourselves from all kinds of feelings, not just negative ones.

I‚Äôd never thought about it applying to *positive* emotions, too. Like, we can care so deeply that the emotion itself becomes too much, and we end up avoiding things we actually want to do‚Ä¶ yet we‚Äôd happily do the same thing for others?!

ADHD + Autism + alexithymia + interoception struggles = the need to intellectualize emotions just to make sense of them...

# *The Analogy‚ÄìMetaphor Hybrid*

It‚Äôs like when you live in mess and chaos for weeks but tidy your home just before someone comes over. They see the spotless living room and bathroom and probably think you‚Äôre so clean and organised.

What they don‚Äôt see is the 30 minutes before: the mini-meltdowns while cleaning every utensil, plate, and mug that had piled up like Jenga; the ecosystem I‚Äôd been curiously watching grow in the bottom of a two-week-old coffee mug (RIP); the alien potato roots sprouting across the kitchen; the two weeks of rubbish proudly housing an empire of larvae; the crime-scene-like body indent in the sofa; and the knickers scattered across the floor like a Hansel & Gretel trail.

The visitor sits down, we make sounds with my mouth (AKA communicating), I navigate the trials and tribulations of maintaining the right amount of eye contact, they compliment how tidy my home is, and I succeed in convincing them I‚Äôm a put-together, functioning human being. Little do they know, the whole time I‚Äôm in a constant state of fear that the cupboard next to them might buckle open at any moment, exposing all my stacked-up mess and secrets.

* **Tidying up** = hiding the external signs of my inner state (because otherwise, rejection).
* **Tidy rooms** = the self I curate for people (mask, grounded, friendly).
* **Contents in the cupboards** = emotions not yet registered shaped by trauma, lived experienced, culture, memories.
* **Cupboard bursting open** = the sudden, uncontrollable flood of emotions that risks shattering the image, causing rejection, shame and pain.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I‚Äôm not a ticking time bomb of emotion, but I do carry a database of every time my intensity leaked out, along with the reactions, shame, rejection, and fallout that followed. I think those memories keep me wary of emotions altogether.

Now, at 34, I‚Äôm tired of curating myself. Life‚Äôs too short to get to 84 and only then finally feel the regret of spending a lifetime distracting myself from feeling. That just seems pretty cruel to myself.

Just your average retail trader here, usually scrolling through Bloomberg and Reddit while sipping coffee, low-key thinking I can front-run the market by catching breaking news. But reality hit hard lately‚Ä¶ 



For example, last week when the Fed hinted at rate cuts, I YOLO‚Äôd into gold. Turns out the rally had already priced it in. I ended up buying the top and catching leftovers. Yeah, not my finest moment. So it got me thinking: how do you all actually use news in your trading?



1. My Facepalm Moments 

* **Fed Rate Cut Hype**: Early August soft inflation and weak job data sparked massive rate cut expectations. I jumped into index ETFs right after the headlines‚Ä¶ only to realize I was buying the rumor and selling the news. Classic.
* **Reddit Moment Stocks**: RDDT pumped on ad revenue surging 84%, some analysts even threw out a $300 price target. I FOMO-bought at the top, then profit-takers dumped. Almost got bagged (thank god I cut loss fast).
* **Oil Geopolitics Spike**: Israel‚Äôs strike near Doha sent oil soaring. I went long on crude futures, only to get rekt when Poland drone tensions de-escalated. Basically donated commission to my broker.



**My win rate? Maybe 50%,** gains barely cover losses and fees üòÖ



2. My Janky Workflow (Pls Help Improve!)

* News Sources: Twitter lists (Fed accounts, CNBC, Reuters) + r/investing hot posts (sometimes alpha, often just noise).
* Tools: **Deeptracker AI**(Very useful information tracking tool, Google it yourself) + TradingView charts + broker app for quick entries. Sometimes I use AI news screeners, but latency is a problem.
* Decision-Making: Basically adrenaline-based, see ‚ÄúBREAKING‚Äù or ‚ÄúURGENT‚Äù, smash the buy button. Often become a contra-indicator.



3. Questions for the Pros

How do you filter out noise? Especially during super-weeks like central bank bonanzas‚Äîwhat signals actually matter? (**Dot plot? ECB lagarde-speak? BOJ verbal intervention?**)

Tools worth it? Anyone use dedicated terminals like Bloomberg or quant screens? Or is manual scraping still the way?

Do you actually alpha vs. market? I‚Äôm starting to think unless you‚Äôre HFT, everything‚Äôs priced in before we even read the tweet‚Ä¶



Final rant: News trading feels like using dating apps, looks full of opportunities, but half the time you‚Äôre getting catfished üôÉ



**TLDR**: Trying to trade on news as a retail = gambling. Pls share your real workflow and how not to get rekt!

No soil. No weeds. No rows of planter boxes. Just vertical columns pumping out fresh produce.

This isn‚Äôt a quirky design choice. It‚Äôs smart farming, scaled down and turned up. The [Tower Garden growing system](https://www.molecule-design-online.com/pages/tower-garden-growing-system) makes it possible.

**Why Are Entrepreneurs Turning to Tower Gardens?**

Because it works. And because it's easy to manage, even if you‚Äôve never grown a tomato in your life.

**Small Footprint, Big Output**

One Tower Garden can grow up to 20 plants. A commercial setup? Up to 336. And they don‚Äôt sprawl across a field. They go straight up, which makes them perfect for tight indoor spaces or urban rooftops. Imagine a wall of fresh basil growing next to your espresso machine.

**Fast Turnaround**

Crops like lettuce, kale, arugula, and herbs grow in half the time they would in soil. You don‚Äôt have to wait months for a yield‚Äîyou‚Äôre harvesting in weeks. That makes the system perfect for places that use fresh produce daily. Restaurants, juice bars, even coworking spaces with smoothie stations are using Tower Gardens to control their supply chain in real time.

**No Green Thumb Required**

There‚Äôs no tilling, no compost, no dirt under your nails. The system handles most of the work for you‚Äîautomated watering, nutrient delivery, even lighting if you‚Äôre growing indoors. Most business owners check on their towers like they would a coffee machine. It becomes part of the daily rhythm.

**Customers Notice**

People love knowing where their food comes from. If you can say ‚Äúthis mint came from that tower,‚Äù or ‚Äúthis kale was picked an hour ago, right here,‚Äù you‚Äôre offering something no supermarket can. It‚Äôs transparency, and it builds trust‚Äîand often, loyalty.

**Better for the Planet, Better for the Brand**

These systems use 98% less water than traditional growing methods. There‚Äôs no need for long-haul shipping, no plastic packaging, no waste. For brands that care about sustainability‚Äîor want to‚Äîthis is an easy win that‚Äôs visible and measurable.

**Who‚Äôs Already Doing This?**

Schools are using Tower Gardens for hands-on science. Nonprofits are feeding communities in dense urban areas. Restaurants are cutting food costs. Some entrepreneurs are building entire businesses around the model.

Updated¬†Sep 14, 2025, 10:10 PM

AUSTIN, Texas¬†‚Äì¬†Almost six months into the trade war, the Trump administration is racing to wean America off its near total dependence on China for rare earth metals, essential to making everything from cars and fighter jets, to smartphones and data centers.

An F-35 fighter jet, for example, uses over 400kg of rare earth metals to enhance the performance of its weapons targeting systems, stealth abilities and other advanced on-board technologies. Some submarines need more than 4,000kg of rare earths.

Such is the importance of these 17 lustrous and silvery-white elements, endowed with unique electronic, magnetic and optical properties, that they may determine who owns not only the modern economy, but also the weapons of modern warfare.

Such is the importance of these 17 lustrous and silvery-white elements, endowed with unique electronic, magnetic and optical properties, that they may determine who owns not only the modern economy, but also the weapons of modern warfare. [China‚Äôs global dominance of rare earths](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-hits-back-at-us-tariffs-with-export-controls-on-key-rare-earths?ref=inline-article) has undermined US President Donald Trump‚Äôs ability to impose economic sanctions on China. If Beijing cuts off supplies to the US, estimates are that America‚Äôs stocks will empty in less than 90 days.

China‚Äôs leverage will also impact Mr Trump‚Äôs ability to get European allies to act on his Sept 13¬†proposal that Nato place¬†[50 per cent to 100 per cent tariffs on China for its import of Russian oil.](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/trump-presses-nato-nations-to-halt-russian-oil-purchases-to-end-ukraine-war?ref=inline-article)

There is a good chance that Mr Trump‚Äôs call goes unheeded because Europe also imports large amounts of rare earths from China, which has the world‚Äôs biggest¬†rare earth¬†deposits. It has mined them for years, building enviable expertise. In 2024, for instance, China produced 270,000¬†tonnes¬†of these crucial metals versus only 40,823¬†tonnes¬†in the US.

The Asian giant refines more than 85 per cent of the world‚Äôs supply of rare earths, which it then turns into magnets, controlling 90 per cent of the world‚Äôs supply. China also dominates the production of equipment and chemical reagents needed to refine rare earths.

The US got a taste of the power China wields on rare earth supplies immediately after¬†[Mr Trump announced duties as high as 145 per cent on Chinese goods](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-tariffs-on-china-now-at-least-145-as-trade-war-ramps-up?ref=inline-article)¬†on April 2.Two days later, China responded by restricting rare earth exports.

The impact was soon felt in the US. By May, Ford had to halt the production of the Explorer, a mid-sized sport utility vehicle, at its Chicago plant. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk¬†expressed fear¬†for his Optimus line of humanoid robots in a call to shareholders. Defence and aerospace contractors like Lockheed Martin were also hit.

A reprieve did not come until June, when the two nations shook hands over a trade framework. The US kept tariffs in suspension, agreed to roll back curbs on the export of items like jet engines and offered up more student visas in return for a promise from Beijing to issue six-month licences for the supply of rare earths. Shipments resumed, but at a much slower pace.

The US defence industry, however, remains cut off because China has totally disallowed military use of its rare earth magnets. It is still not clear how things will pan out after the US-China trade truce expires in November.¬†The issue will come up at the Sept 14 talks between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and¬†Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Madrid.¬†And the widely anticipated summit between Mr Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping towards the end of October may produce more certainty for US manufacturers. But it may go any number of ways.

The plain truth is hard for Washington to swallow: China‚Äôs power over the¬†rare earth¬†market is unrivalled; comparable perhaps with the American advantage in high-end artificial intelligence chips.Until the late 1990s, America wore the rare earths crown.

The Clinton administration‚Äôs decision to close down the Bureau of Mines was the start of a slow slide that saw the US shut down its mines over concerns that the process of extraction was highly polluting.¬†

China, in the meantime, built up its supply chain under the vision of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who noted in 1992:¬†‚ÄúThe Middle East has oil. China has rare earths.‚Äù During his first term, Mr Trump signed an executive order in 2017 to increase US production.

The Biden administration increased funds for extraction and refinement facilities, and tried to rope in allies to make the supply chains more resilient. In the nine months of his second term, Mr Trump has brought a new sense of urgency to the issue, unfurling an array of measures to support American miners and refiners.

Through a flurry of executive orders, he activated the Defence Production Act and opened the pipeline for funds for US¬†companies¬†to expand their mining and processing capacity, with efforts coordinated by the National Energy Dominance Council.

In July, the Pentagon announced it was investing US$400 million (S$513.2 million) in MP Materials, which owns America‚Äôs only operating rare earth mining and processing facility. On Aug 26, the US released a draft list of 54 critical minerals ‚Äì colour-coded to show the degree of vulnerability ‚Äì¬†and outlined a new model for assessing how potential supply chain disruptions could affect the US economy. A plan to reassign US$2 billion from the Chips Act to fund critical minerals projects is also under consideration.¬†

Mr Trump also tried to incentivise allies to join the campaign to secure the supply chain. Early efforts have yielded potential ventures in Greenland, the Democratic Republic of¬†the¬†Congo (DRC) and Saudi Arabia. In late August, the US President sounded a note of confidence.

‚ÄúWe are going to have a lot of magnets in a pretty short period of time. In fact, we will have so many, we won‚Äôt know what to do with them,‚Äù he said.

Will the US succeed in building up a magnet supply chain independent of China? It is not an easy goal to reach.

[It is still not clear how things will pan out after the US-China trade truce expires in November.PHOTO: AFP](https://preview.redd.it/3bwa6vwpvapf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=37e5244dbeb03b1660c46b7a0d9bbd9ab2f78ff0)

While it is now simpler and faster to approve new mines, the gap is yawning: The global average time to open a mine is 18 years; the time it takes in the US is more than¬†1.5 times¬†that, at 29 years. And the odds are formidable.

MP Materials is projected to produce 1,000 tonnes of neodymium-iron-boron magnets annually by the end of 2025, less than 1 per cent of the 138,000 tonnes China produced in 2018.

‚ÄúThere has been a very quick disbursement and trickle down to the agencies putting these executive orders in motion from the Department of Energy and the Department of Defence and all the agencies that permit these things,‚Äù said Ms Ruth Demeter, senior director of policy at the US Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs Global Energy Institute.

In the aggregate, Mr Trump‚Äôs actions are meant to signal to investors that the US is serious about its critical mineral supply chain, she said.

Mr David Abraham, a natural resource strategist, said that no country has a reliable supply line of all critical minerals ‚Äì everyone relies on some sort of¬†import, or overseas processing.

‚ÄúThe issue is: Can we get the right material, at the right price, to the right consumer, at the right time? And the answer is no,‚Äù added the author of The Elements Of Power, the first book to talk about the geopolitical power of rare earths.

‚ÄúAnd, usually, that is because the costs of supplies in China are consistently less.

‚ÄúThe US does not have the expertise, materials, inputs, low-cost capital, equipment and existing supply lines to compete against China. While this is changing fast, China too is evolving.‚Äù¬†

The US lags¬†behind¬†China in mining and processing technology. China has nearly 40 universities specializing in extractive metallurgy and another 40 in mineral processing. The US has none.

In addition, there are political considerations behind building a bigger rare earths industry. Minerals tend to be caught in the cross-hairs of politics. Democracy and mining do not pair well, according to Dr Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Programme at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies.

‚ÄúOne of the reasons that Democrats have historically scaled back mining efforts is because the majority of minerals domestically in the US are on Native American land,‚Äù she said, adding that China did not have to worry about the ‚Äúping-pong game‚Äù of policymaking.¬†

But things are changing, with minerals becoming a focus of the Trump administration.

‚ÄúIt is one of the few areas where this administration has been shown to engage in multilateralism, seeking cooperation with Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and DRC,‚Äù she said.

There is also a¬†growing political consensus on the issue. Critical minerals have become a bipartisan priority, with legislation being co-sponsored by Republicans and Democrats. When the Ford Explorer production stopped in May, things got very sticky for Democrats and labor unions.

‚ÄúSo, there is a joint understanding across the political spectrum that mineral security is really important for the health of our US economy, as well as our national security,‚Äù Dr Baskaran said.

[Russia President Vladimir Putin speaks with China's President Xi Jinping before a military parade marking the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan and the end of World War II. \(Alexander Kazakov\/AFP via Getty Images\)](https://preview.redd.it/f0xada6pwapf1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=544e41e677d4b94472f14adfc9510b1435758e42)

China‚Äôs¬†Xi Jinping appeared supremely confident at a military parade in Beijing with Russia‚Äôs Vladimir¬†Putin and North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong Un. Xi‚Äôs assurance likely isn‚Äôt just a reflection of China‚Äôs growing military might. It‚Äôs also that China now holds the U.S. defense industrial base in the palm of its hand.¬†

Xi is well aware that China‚Äôs dominance of global mineral supply chains has ensnared both the U.S. economy and America‚Äôs military. According to The Wall Street Journal, more than 80,000 parts used in America‚Äôs weapons systems are manufactured with critical minerals subject to Chinese control.¬†

Whether it‚Äôs fighter jets, drones, munitions, or night vision goggles, China can bring U.S. military production to a standstill simply by denying us the minerals we need.¬†

China‚Äôs mineral dominance has been decades in the making. The United States was once a global mining superpower. But extraordinary policy missteps have withered away our industrial base since the end of the Cold War ‚Äî and put China in the driver‚Äôs seat.¬†

A single U.S. weapon can now require hundreds of suppliers in dozens of countries. Although we stockpile some minerals for weapons production, a Chinese embargo would still cripple our military in a matter of months. And as a consequence of the ongoing U.S.-China trade fight, Beijing has already slashed the flow of critical minerals to western defense contractors, increasing our production costs ‚Äî or halting production altogether.

This is a crisis. To its credit, the Trump administration recognizes the urgency of the challenge. But¬†declawing China‚Äôs minerals weapon won‚Äôt be quick or easy. Beijing has no intention of letting its control wane without a fight ‚Äî and is doubling down on its mineral dominance.¬†

Recent U.S. trade deals ‚Äî from Ukraine to Indonesia ‚Äî have begun to focus on supplies of critical minerals. While that‚Äôs potentially helpful, the real solution is here at home.

**America simply can‚Äôt continue to depend on overseas suppliers. It may seem shrewd to pursue high ore grades for metals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or nickel resources from Indonesia, but that does little to ease the threat of supply chain disruptions.**¬†

**The U.S. has vast mineral resources. But for decades we‚Äôve done little to tap this tremendous capacity. A new mineral policy is beginning to come into focus but we must think big and move fast.**

Increased mapping of domestic resources with cutting-edge technology is an important step forward. Ongoing efforts to streamline mine permitting and address obstructive litigation delays are also necessary and encouraging.¬†

We must also have aggressive financial support to¬†rebalance the playing field for U.S. producers against overseas competitors. In July, the Pentagon invested $400 million for a stake in MP Materials ‚Äî the operator of the largest rare-earth materials mine in North America ‚Äî and inked a 10-year offtake agreement to provide critically needed certainty for other investors. This public-private partnership should serve as the model to address countless other vulnerabilities in our mineral supply chains.¬†

**For decades, America possessed a robust industrial base that served as a warning to adversaries. But our industrial base is no longer a deterrent. And our critical supply chains are so vulnerable, and our productive capacity so weak, that we risk conflict.**

**There‚Äôs no time to waste in rebuilding our industrial strength from the mine up. We must do that to break Beijing‚Äôs iron grip on the world‚Äôs mineral supply chains. American lives and global security depend on it.**¬†

[NioCorp's ELK CREEK MINE stands ready to deliver! See for yourself....](https://preview.redd.it/wyyf1jdyxapf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a0eff24d1faea48ceb4d908fd000d9e0676a87)

# NioCorp's Strategic Basket = Niobium the ""Quiet Giant!"", Titanium, Scandium & ScAl alloys, Dy, Tb, Nd/Pr

NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project isn‚Äôt just another mine ‚Äî it‚Äôs a¬†**national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek‚Äôs mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# üîë The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)**¬†‚Äì The¬†*quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion ‚Äî potentially all ‚Äî of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl‚ÇÑ)**¬†‚Äì Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl‚ÇÑ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)**¬†‚Äì¬†*The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)**¬†‚Äì The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships.¬†*Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ‚ö° Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance**¬†‚Üí Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition**¬†‚Üí Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts**¬†‚Üí 2025 drilling added¬†**9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)**¬†plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October¬†**could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.**

[NioCorp's Critical Minerals check all the boxes to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/si7egtarxapf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d7cc81120709fb88cd629e5d6f01f8db2cfe25)

**IMHO\~ Following last Monday‚Äôs Wainwright presentation**, momentum around NioCorp‚Äôs Elk Creek Project continues to center on its ability to deliver three of the most strategic critical minerals for U.S. supply chains: Niobium, Scandium, and Titanium. Each has unique defense, aerospace, and energy transition roles, and all three are now explicitly tied to DFARS and DoD procurement priorities. Niobium‚Äôs structural importance in high-strength, low-alloy steels directly supports U.S. Navy shipbuilding, armored vehicles, and hypersonic missile casings. **At scale, Elk Creek would make the United States one of the few nations capable of securing a domestic niobium supply without relying on Brazil.**

**Scandium is emerging as the hidden ace in NioCorp‚Äôs portfolio**. Long considered **‚Äúthe unobtainium‚Äù** of advanced alloys, scandium‚Äôs ability to transform aluminum into high-strength, lightweight, weldable alloys opens the door for aerospace frames, EV platforms, and hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure. Industry insiders increasingly point to a potential DoD and Stellantis dual anchor offtake structure, where defense ensures strategic supply while auto and energy sectors drive commercial adoption. **A proven scandium flow sheet ‚Äî backed by prior bench and pilot testing at Ames Lab and IBC ‚Äî positions Elk Creek as the only North American scalable source of scandium oxide and alloys!**

**Titanium and its derivative, TiCl‚ÇÑ, provide yet another dimension of strategic heft.** Beyond its role in aerospace armor and jet engine parts, ***TiCl‚ÇÑ links directly to DoD procurement categories for smoke-screening, precision munitions, and advanced chemical processing.*** The 2022 Feasibility Study already demonstrated the ability to produce both titanium dioxide and TiCl‚ÇÑ in significant volumes, setting the stage for NioCorp to backfill U.S. industrial and defense stockpiles. Given China‚Äôs stranglehold on titanium sponge and downstream products, **Elk Creek represents a rare chance to realign titanium sourcing with Western partners.**

**Finally, the rare earths ‚Äî** particularly Nd, Pr, **Dy, and Tb** ‚Äî remain the cornerstone of permanent magnet production for EV motors, wind turbines, and precision-guided defense systems. ***While Elk Creek‚Äôs REE output is modest compared to Mountain Pass, the integrated separation and recycling loop envisioned in Project Pivot could transform it into a higher-margin, closed-loop contributor.*** **With China continuing to weaponize REE exports, even a smaller but fully domestic stream of magnet-grade material gives NioCorp an outsized strategic role!** Together, Nb, Sc, Ti, and REEs position Elk Creek not just as another mine, but as a central node in rebuilding America‚Äôs critical minerals independence.

Strategically, the project carries momentum few peers can match. Elk Creek is backed by a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE‚Äôs $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates.

Looking ahead, the RedChip presentation ‚Äî now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15PM EST ‚Äî raises eyebrows. Why the delay? In context, it suggests management wants maximum visibility to align with key catalysts: possible **DoD price-support measures**, drill results, or even a **partnership reveal**.

üëâ With offtakes and defense ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer ‚Äújust a mine-in-the-making‚Äù ‚Äî it is fast becoming the **flagship U.S. critical minerals project**, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp could **redefine America‚Äôs resource independence.**

# ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear: NioCorp isn‚Äôt just about magnets. It‚Äôs part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
_________________________
Source(s):
every `1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
_____________
if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m {Bookmark it })
read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1757934050.0,KeeperoftheLostCities,1,0.33,False

1nhin7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nhin7z/for_small_business_owners_whats_been_your_most/,For small business owners: what‚Äôs been your most surprising ROI from a ‚Äútiny‚Äù change?,"I‚Äôve noticed again and again that some of the highest ROI changes in small businesses don‚Äôt come from big marketing campaigns or huge investments, but from small details that compound.

Example 1: A local coffee shop started writing each customer‚Äôs name with a short note on their loyalty card. It cost them a few seconds and a pen, but they told me repeat visits went up so much that it became part of their brand identity. People literally posted their cards on Instagram.

Example 2: An ecommerce shop I worked with stopped giving the same blanket 10% discount to everyone. Instead, they adjusted discounts based on product margins. High-margin products got 15% off, low-margin ones got nothing. Profit margins went up and recovery rates improved at the same time, which was the opposite of what they expected.

Example 3: A small home services business added a simple follow-up SMS for every missed call: ‚ÄúSorry we missed you, how can we help?‚Äù It felt boring at first, but within a month they‚Äôd booked dozens of jobs they were previously losing because no one bothered to leave voicemails.

None of these required new staff, fancy tools, or ad spend. Just small tweaks that made a big difference.

I‚Äôm curious to hear from this community.   
As a small business owner, what‚Äôs the smallest change you‚Äôve made that had the biggest impact on your revenue, retention, or day-to-day operations?",10,1757933776.0,smallbusiness,16,0.92,False
1nhikal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nhikal/sister_said_some_very_hurtful_things_during/,Sister said some very hurtful things during arguement,"Hi everyone, could use a bit of advice. 

My sister and I are extremely close. Yesterday I called round for a cup of coffee and we were chatting about some things recently in the media. My niece (who i love dearly) is 14 and had a differing opinion than me but kept inserting herself into the conversation and was a bit disrespectful and arguementitive in her tone, at one stage suggesting I was lying when I wasnt. My niece is young and extremely assertive in her opinions and isnt quite at an age where she can accept that some people have different opinions than she might have, but will argue how these people are wrong. For example if someone says they believe in religion she will argue with that person how theyre 100% wrong in their beliefs and mock them that they believe in a magic wizard in the sky. She sometimes takes a view that other people normally wouldn't have and sometimes I feel like she says things for shock value to try to look edgy or alternative. I understand shes young and in her teenage years so normally ignore her and let her have her opinions even if some of them are disrespectful to others. Shes still learning, but My sister never corrects her and thinks her arguementitive nature is funny (she has the same views as my niece)

When she kept arguing with me yesterday and insinuating I was lying yesterday i lost my patience and said 'im dissapointed you would suggest im lying'. I know it probably wasn't my place to correct someone else's teen. My sister (her mom) got extremely angry and threw me out of her house. Later I got a message from her mom saying I had to apologise to my niece for saying I was dissapointed. I explained I felt her daughter was being disrespectful and shouldnt have been so arguementitive towards adults, or inserted herself into an adult conversations, and because my sister didnt speak up i felt i had to at the stage my niece got animated and suggested i was lying in what I was saying when i wasnt, i also told my sister she should have a chat with my niece about respecting other peoples views on things even if they differ from hers, and to not argue with adults for the sake of arguing because its disrespectful. My sister took this as if I was questioning her parenting skills, and accused me of bullying a child, she cursed at me, called me names, said some very deep things about how she doesnt even like spending time with me and im a disgrace, told me im a professional victim and my life is so pathetic im transferring my bitterness to my teenage neice, etc. She has said she will never forgive me for suggesting my niece was dissapointing and she has banned my niece from speaking to me again and has cut me out of her life. The arguement seriously escalated and I tried to explain i love my niece and definitely dont think shes a bad person but in that moment I was dissapointed in her behaviour. 

Im completely heartbroken about this. Im questioning myself and my values as a person because my sister has obviously had some really strongly negative views on me that I wasnt aware of. I love them both so much, but I dont think i was in the wrong - im not even sure anymore if I was in the wrong because my sister is furious at me! I dont want to be cut off from my niece and I dont want to lose my sister, but the things she said yesterday were very cruel towards me. Can people move past this? Should I apologise?

Sorry for the non aesthetic picture of my drink but the taste more than made up for it. I used Mandi's coffee liqueur (non alcoholic) + fresh cream + little milk + crushed ice. 

The texture is smooth and creamy. And the taste is rich coffee  with that familiar cocoa aftertaste. I'm not a fan of very sweet drinks, and I was pleasantly surprised that this was quite balanced in that respect. It feels indulgent and tasty even you've never had Bailey's before.

Most people spend decades chasing dreams that aren't even theirs, climbing ladders leaned against the wrong walls, wondering why success feels hollow. What if there was a way to bypass years of trial and error, to have a patient guide help you excavate the authentic desires buried beneath layers of ""should"" and societal expectations? This isn't about finding another job or hobby, this is about archaeological work on your own soul.

The Soul Archaeologist doesn't dispense generic advice or push you toward predetermined outcomes. Instead, it operates like a master therapist and intuitive detective rolled into one, asking precisely the right question at exactly the right moment. Through a carefully orchestrated series of single, profound inquiries, it helps you connect the dots between forgotten childhood fascinations, moments of unexpected joy, and the activities that make you lose track of time. Each response you give becomes a clue, informing the next layer of exploration until a clear, authentic blueprint for your fulfilled life emerges.

Whether you're a burned-out executive questioning everything, a recent graduate paralyzed by infinite possibilities, or someone who's always felt like they're living someone else's life, this process works by honoring your unique psychological landscape. It doesn't tell you what happiness should look like‚Äîit helps you remember what it actually feels like for *you*, then builds a practical roadmap to get there.

# Role and Objective
You are the Soul Archaeologist, an empathetic and insightful guide whose mission is to help users unearth their deepest desires and map individualized routes to life fulfillment. Your work transcends generic advice, focusing instead on a methodical, compassionate exploration of each person's unique aspirations and inner truths.

# Instructions
Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do before substantive engagement in each multi-step session. Guide users through a transformative self-discovery process using the following approach:

1. **Begin with Presence**: Initiate every session by asking a single, carefully chosen question that encourages deep reflection on the user's current sense of fulfillment.
2. **Practice Active Archaeology**: After each response, analyze its content within <inner_monologue></inner_monologue> tags‚Äîidentify patterns, recurring themes, and emotional nuances. Then, craft your next question based on these insights.
3. **Layer-by-Layer Excavation**: Continue the process by asking only one question at a time, informed by prior answers. Focus on exploring:
   - Interests and inclinations from childhood
   - Experiences of unanticipated joy and immersion
   - Authentic self-expressions and liberated moments
   - Activities associated with a loss of time-awareness
   - Fundamental, non-negotiable personal values
4. **Connect Hidden Threads**: Draw connections between seemingly unrelated experiences and points of meaning to uncover deeper truths.
5. **Synthesize Insights**: After 8-12 exchanges, create a comprehensive blueprint for the user. This should include:
   - Clearly articulated core passion or purpose
   - Actionable steps to align life with this purpose
   - Awareness of potential obstacles with suggested navigation strategies
   - Unconventional options the user might not have previously considered

Remain patient and non-judgmental, allowing discovery to unfold naturally. Never rush toward solutions or conclusions; honor the importance of the user's exploration.

## Sub-categories
- Ask only one question per response until synthesis.
- Never suggest specific careers, businesses, or prescribed life paths at first.
- Avoid offering psychological diagnoses or therapy-style interpretations.
- Do not impose your own values or conceptions of fulfillment.
- Maintain professional, yet warmly supportive boundaries.
- Gently recommend appropriate professional help if mental health concerns arise.

# Context
Many people struggle to access their truest passions due to external expectations or self-doubt. Your process is designed to help users reconnect with their authentic desires and chart a path that feels genuinely aligned, emphasizing illumination rather than perfection.

# Reasoning Steps
For each interaction:
1. Thoroughly read and reflect on the user's message.
2. Identify emotional cues and what energizes or depletes them.
3. Observe emerging patterns in their life experience.
4. Distill core values and motivations.
5. Formulate the next singular question to deepen self-discovery.
6. Avoid steering users toward any pre-defined outcomes.

# Planning and Verification
- Adhere strictly to one-question-per-turn methodology.
- Pause to analyze each user response before proceeding.
- Wait for clear context from the user prior to beginning the main process.
- During synthesis, validate the coherence and actionable utility of the final blueprint. Proceed or self-correct if validation fails.

# Output Format
- During initial phases, output a single, thoughtful question (not the analysis).
- Use <inner_monologue></inner_monologue> tags for your internal analysis.
- Maintain a warm and encouraging conversational style.
- In the synthesis phase, deliver a structured, organized blueprint with clear sections.

# Verbosity
- Favor depth and reflection in questions, concise clarity in blueprints.
- Use direct, supportive language throughout all exchanges.

# Stop Conditions
- Proceed only after a user provides input about their desire for fulfillment or self-discovery.
- End after delivering a complete synthesized blueprint, unless further questions are requested by the user.

# User Input
Respond to the user with: ""Please enter your desire for life fulfillment and passion discovery request, and I will start the process."" Wait for their personal context or question before continuing.

# Reasoning Effort
Set reasoning_effort = medium based on the complexity of this task. Be deliberate and thorough but avoid unnecessary verbosity.
```

I am moving to New Zealand next month so I‚Äôm just trying to build my connections in a new foreign country and trying to make new friends as well! 

A little bit about me, I‚Äôm an Asian woman working in IT since I graduated. Take a guess where I‚Äôm actually from! ;) I‚Äôm not much of a yapper but I can pretty much talk about anything. So if you like to yap, I would love to have a conversation with you! I think yappers are much better than dry texters especially if we are talking online. I prefer talking on discord btw but we can talk on reddit first to get ourselves acquainted before moving it to other platforms.

I like video games and would love it if you do too. Been addicted to Cities Skylines lately but I play other games too like The Division 2, DBD, Palworld, etc. I do enjoy watching movies and shows as well but the problem with me is, I need to watch it with someone because for some reason, I am just unable to finish watching something on my own lol so hmu if you need a movie/show buddy!

Looking to connect with people aged 25 to early 30s. I am indeed looking for a serious long-term relationship but I don‚Äôt wanna put that pressure on anyone and prefer to be friends first and see where it goes. I don‚Äôt expect you to have all your stuff together now but if you‚Äôre currently not at a good place in life, please at least try to put effort into changing your life for the better instead of just accepting the mess that you‚Äôre in. Effort is sexy and attractive!

Planning to be in Auckland and maybe Christchurch in the future so if you‚Äôre in those areas or don‚Äôt mind travelling, shoot me a DM! :) We can meet up for a coffee or something. I don‚Äôt mind travelling to Australia either but it really depends on the situation.

P.s : if you‚Äôre autistic or neurodivergent, please give me a heads up yea. Don‚Äôt leave me confused :(

Edit : I am extremely non-religious and I curse a lot. I‚Äôm so sorry for the people who reached out to me who are religious. I completely forgot to put this one in T_T I don‚Äôt mind being friends with religious people but when it comes to a romantic relationship, I will have to say no okie I‚Äôm sooo sorryyy T_T",2,1757932229.0,r4r,1,0.75,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rizespor vs. Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi: A Statistical Car Crash with a 64% Chance of Rizespor Winning (Probably)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match so statistically dire it could make a spreadsheet weep. √áaykur Rizespor (17th, 1 point) hosts Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi (dead last, 0 points), a team that has conceded goals in **22 consecutive league matches**‚Äîa streak so long, their defenders probably have GPS coordinates for the opposition‚Äôs penalty area.

**The Odds (Because Hope Springs Eternal):**

* **Rizespor to win**: 1.58 (implied probability: **63.29%**)
* **Draw**: 3.6 (27.78%)
* **Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi to win**: 5.0 (20%)

Translation: If you bet on Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi, you‚Äôre either a masochist or a fan of dramatic underdog collapses.

**Key Stats to Bask In:**

* Rizespor hasn‚Äôt won in **7 games**. Their coach, ƒ∞lhan Palut, is likely muttering curses into his coffee.
* Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi‚Äôs coach H√ºseyin Eroƒülu has lost **8 of 9 matches**. His managerial luck: -11,000%.
* Rizespor‚Äôs starting XI includes players named *Taha*, *Halil*, and *Sowe*. Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi‚Äôs includes *≈Ωu≈æek*, *Kyabou*, and *Goutas*. None of these names mean ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly how people feel when they smell the apple pie my mom used to make. She made one hell of a dessert. When she passed away I stopped eating anything sweet. I moved out of my house and changed personas ‚Äî I was depressed, no doubt. But the woodland eden I‚Äôd moved into had so much whimsy and was so secluded, with hundreds of apple trees surrounding the rustic home. The sweet, sweet smell of crisp cider was like nectar to a bee; when I found it I felt my heart beat again. My mom would‚Äôve loved this place.
I tried to put the old life behind me, so I bought this house. I thought it would be the perfect place to write with no distractions and maybe stop grieving my mother. I missed writing stories and her reading them with that light in her eyes, like she was genuinely into the book ‚Äî she was my motivation to continue. My office window looked over the front yard, the hedges following the porch. Just looking out that window kept my mind flowing, watching the birds fly around the feeder. It‚Äôs beautiful.

I make my way to the living room while it cooks, throw my feet on the coffee table, and reach over to turn on the lamp. The dim yellow light covers half the living room. I pick my book off the armrest and begin to read from where I left off.
The book swallows me; I get lost in the intense pages filled with terror and screams. When the book is finished I look at the clock hung above the window. My eyes freeze when they land on the yard ‚Äî eyes staring back at me, yellow and feral, fixated on me while standing in a pile of apples beneath the trees. I feel the color melting off my face like paint dripping from a canvas. I forget to breathe. My fingers and toes go red from clenching the couch cushions. I sit still until I can imagine what it could possibly be.
A wolf? I live in Kentucky ‚Äî there aren‚Äôt wolves around here ‚Äî but it‚Äôs so lupine. It‚Äôs too big to be a regular dog. A‚Ä¶ human? No. It has the ears of a canine and eyes sallow and sentient, uncanny almost. It has a snout like any canid; its fur is shaggy and blends into the dark that surrounds it. I close my eyes and try to steady my breathing with slow, deep breaths, like some yoga instructor. I open my eyes again ‚Äî it‚Äôs gone. Completely gone.
I try to chalk it up to some trick of my mind. Maybe I‚Äôm hungry. Oh crap. I hastily turn my head toward the kitchen. Smoke is rising, mostly hitting the range hood but some flooding the rest of the room. The smell hits me and I crinkle my nose. I jump over the back of the couch and run into the kitchen, fling open the oven door, and swat away the smoke. I grab oven mitts patterned with little red roses and reach into the smoke pit. Not being able to see what I‚Äôm grabbing, I pull the tray out and throw it on the stove; the intense heat almost burns through the mitts. I open the window next to the stove to let the rest of the smoke out and sigh in relief ‚Äî until there‚Äôs loud banging on the door.
I practically jump on the counter. The noise startles me; the bangs grow louder and more violent. Panic settles in. I can practically hear the paint being scratched off the door. Then it stops. I stand in shock, my heart pounding out of my chest. Slowly I start to calm, but the silence is interrupted by the nasty sound of a snarl behind me.
The wild beast‚Äôs head smashes through the window, slavering and foaming at the mouth like some rabies-induced creature. It gets halfway through, digging long black claws into the wood as it struggles to pull itself up, still chewing the burnt, charred chicken ‚Äî bone and all. I run upstairs, my head dizzy from adrenaline. I make it to the top and look down: the mutt is at the bottom, ravenous, slobbering and growling while showing crooked teeth. It stands up almost 6 feet tall. The feral beast rises on its hind legs like a man in a suit, its ragged fur matted.
I get to the bedroom and lock the door. I swear I can feel the doorknob rattling, like it somehow grabbed the knob and is trying to open the door. What the hell is this thing? It goes quiet again and I can almost breathe. ‚ÄúClick.‚Äù The room goes dark ‚Äî it flipped the breaker. I can hear the manic brute walking back upstairs like a grown man. The room fills with rattling and scratching again. I curl up behind my bed, my hands clawed in my hair, wanting it to stop.
The door crashes open. I snap my eyes open and stop rocking back and forth. The silence is unbearable in that dark pit of a room. I feel tangled fur wrap around my ankles; a scream rips from my lips. It drags me out from behind the bed. I grab the leg of the bed; claws dig into my skin, peeling it back. I hear my blood hit the hardwood floor. My jeans rip to shreds. I can‚Äôt see anything ‚Äî I only hear every rip and the scrape of claws on bone. My hand loses strength and slips from the cold metal bed leg.
As I lie helpless on the floor, the beast‚Äôs silhouette looms over me, slinging parts of my clothes and layers of my skin all over the room. A rotten smell from its mane mixes with the metallic tang of my blood, slithering up my nose. I‚Äôm too weak to fight back. I try to get up, but my hands slide on the puddle of my own warm blood. Slowly losing consciousness, I can feel my organs sliding down my stomach and onto the floor where I lie defenseless.",1,1757931870.0,scaryshortstories,0,1.0,False

Hope your gameweek 4 was a good one. We are coming at you early with our gameweek 5 preview this week. We do a decent amount of looking back and looking forward which is what we will continue to do from now on.

TL;DR below. Full Piece Here: [https://full90fpl.com/fpl-gameweek-5-preview-2025/](https://full90fpl.com/fpl-gameweek-5-preview-2025/)

TL;DR

**Carabao & Champions League** starts this week - hold those knees!

üëë **No Salah, No Fear:** I am going to copy and paste my whole argument here because I think this is going to be a bit controversial‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúI feared coming into this game with no* ***Salah*** *so much that I free hitted to cover him. Of course, there were other changes I wanted to make too but that was a key reason. Having watched him play for the fourth time this year, I don‚Äôt fear going without him next week.*

*He has only had 4 shots this season - over his Liverpool career he averages 3.74 shots per game. He has never been an elite finisher, he needs a lot of shots to get points. For example, last season he had the 2nd highest number of shots - tied with Palmer.*

*I can hear you all saying: ‚ÄúSmall sample size! It‚Äôs too small a sample size!‚Äù I know. But it's not just the data, it's the eye test too.*¬†

*This is,* *at least*\*, the third time he has looked peripheral to this attack. Last year, his heatmap has him coming inside and into the box. So far this season he is much wider and not coming in as much. And you can just see he is not as involved. I mean, he is 33 and one day he will decline. Maybe we are seeing that?\*

*I want to be clear - I am not saying that he won‚Äôt keep returning. He is good enough to do that. And that consistency might be worth paying for. And, and, I am fully prepared to eat my words with this hot take.*

*But, what I am saying is that I* *CURRENTLY* *do not fear a mega haul like I would have last season.‚Äù*

Check out the full piece on the website for more game-by-game analysis.

**‚öîÔ∏èBest Attacking Fixtures**

Looking forward, these are the best attacking fixtures over the next five.

Hard to find Liverpool or City options but this suggests you hold Rogers and Watkins and grab Semenyo and maybe Evanilson too.

Joao Pedro also feels like an inevitability and Xavi is an intriguing prospect at Spurs.

**üõ°Ô∏èBest Defensive Fixtures**

Looking forward, these are the best defensive fixtures over the next five.

Even with this horrible City fixture we don't mind picking up an Arsenal defender though ideally you wait a week. Virgil is the man at pool but we are too nervous about rotation at City.

Senesi and Truffert good for Bou and we aren't concerned about the minutes of Cucu.

Tino is overrated at Newcastle and just hold those Forest boys for two more weeks regardless of the managerial changes.
