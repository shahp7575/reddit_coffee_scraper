1k3sqdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/1k3sqdu/a_nb_covered_bridge_story_in_light_of_the_recent/,A NB COVERED BRIDGE story in light of the recent demolition announcement posts:,"I wrote this fiction in 2017.  The bridge is real.  Sad to read that the province of New Brunswick, has slated a similar nearby bridge for demolition and replacement -- not restoration and improvement.  I'd help in the efforts to bring attention to the cause, but fear it's moving forward despite the opposition.  So, if you want to take the time to read a quick tale of creative writing about a local icon, then just keep reading....

Naming Bridge #3

Crisp air, vibrant fall colours, a picnic lunch, and probably the last use I’d get out of my well-worn hiking boots -- we tossed water bottles and phone charger into the car.  I wanted to capture all those colours to get us through the long winter ahead.

Though there are many covered bridges in Albert County, we’d never made the trek to Crooked Creek # 3.  There’s the 45 Road, Sawmill Creek, Shepody River, and others -- we’d even ventured out to King’s County to visit more of those long-standing icons of New Brunswick.  But the more strenuous hike up the old logging road to see #3 kept putting me off; I love scenery, but not exertion and sweating.

Naturally I’d read all about the history of the bridges, but it’s the local stories that folks share and have been told in the post office lobby, standing with ice cream or coffee in front of Crooked Creek Convenience Store at the corner, or told while shuffling the deck at card parties.

It’s the old-timers that have the best tales.  “If it isn’t true, it ‘oughta be!”, “Well, I heard it from a man who knows a fella who sez it’s true!”, and “anyway, take it as you hear it; my salt shaker don’t spill”.... So who knows what story is factual, augmented, entirely made up, embellished; they’re the fabric of the stories of our rural county living.

Before heading out, we stopped at the Buddha Bear Coffee Roaster cafe in Alma, and asked for extra sugar -- “I’ll need the energy today!” I told Peter, one of the owners.  When he asked what our plans for the day were, I explained our destination, shared my enthusiasm for exploring the last on our list of Albert County covered bridges, and asked if he’d been there yet.

Then I heard a harrumph at the coffee bar, and looked over to see an unfamiliar, older gray-haired man, with both hands wrapped around his mug of coffee, “Silly pursuits.” he muttered. I dropped my shoulders, and tsked.  “Don’t say that!” I cheerfully responded, “It’s a beautiful fall day, and we’re off on a fun little adventure; you’ll spoil it.”

“SPOIL IT?!” he barked back, “I’ll tell you about spoiling things…..how ‘bout a spoiled LIFE?”

Not knowing how to respond, we just watched him.  It was a little un-nerving, and we certainly didn’t want to engage with a hostile curmudgeon just as we were about to set out for a fun-filled day, but something seemed sad and lonely about him.  So we hesitated a moment more to see if what he’d say next.

He shifted a little, looked up slightly, and quickly glanced back and forth at both of us a few times.  “You married?” 

“Yes! 36 years ago this week, actually” I was proud to answer.  “That’s why we’re off this morning, an annual fall-colour outing to celebrate.”

“Yeah, well I was married once a long time ago -- longer than that in fact, and he looked back to his coffee cup with what looked like an odd mix of resentment and longing.  He made me nervous, so I nudged us along and said, “We’d better get going….” and he said quietly said, “Oh, sure, you love birds head off to that Bridge # 3 …. You’re so young, you probably don’t even know why it’s named that”…...looking up he met our faces, looked boldly, challengingly, and waited; his silence demanding a response.

…..”um, no I guess not, really…..”

He leaned back, picked up his coffee cup, took a sip, and started a story we’ll never forget.

""I was young, about to be married, working in the woods, logging, hauling timber, cutting lumber, and it was the loneliest work I’d ever done.  Long exhausting days followed by dark cold nights spent in solitude that seemed even longer than the day.  

For my wedding, I hauled myself out of the woods at the end of the work season, crossed the Crooked Creek Bridge -- that was the name of it in those days -- ready to see my girl, get married, and end my days and nights of loneliness.""

He took another sip of coffee, nodding, remembering….he looked at us again, we looked at each other wondering if we should interrupt and just head off, but his look compelled us to stay for more of his narration.

""In those days, we hauled our loads out of the woods by ground-skidding.  Horse teams, strong men, grappling, block and tackle, it was crummy work -- see what I did there?  The crummy was the wagon that took the crew out to the work site….yeah, you folks have no idea…..I was a feller, all right -- but when I came out of the solitude of the woods, I was a son-of-a-***** of a fella. -- excuse me, for that last one, Ma’m” 

-- he gave me a wink, and raised his cup to me for the apology, then to Peter for a refill on his coffee.

""Well, that job got me enough to pay for my wedding and for a horse, so I bought it and hooked that old filly right up to our wagon, said “I DO”, and took my new bride out for our first ride together.  She cuddled right up to me on the box seat, and it was right nice.  But just as we were about to cross that Crooked Creek Bridge, that old filly reared, and jostled us all about, nearly tossing us out, and I worked hard to get her under control.""

As he described the incident, it looked like he was still holding the reins in one hand while holding on to his now invisible bride.  He bucked and jerked still seated on his bar seat, and we all felt the relief as he described the calm after the struggle.  

“That’s ONE” he said.

""Well, we continued on, all calmed down and back again my dear bride slid close next to me, and just as we exited the other side of the bridge, didn’t that old horse do the same thing again…""

Now he stood, pantomiming the actions, grimacing at the strength it took, his dark eyes were fully recalling the danger, the power of that horse, and the skill required to rein it back to safely righting their wagon.  

He sat back down, winded, took another sip of coffee, and said, “That’s TWO” and loudly clanked his cup back on the wooden bar as he sharply said the word TWO.

""Well, by now, I’d had my fill of this uncooperative old horse, and decided to return it back to get my money back so I turned that horse right back around and headed back across the bridge to go home ….  He paused in thought.  Yup, so back through that bridge we go, and by now, naturally, my bride…. she’s disappointed, and scared, and all discombobulated, and don’t you know it just as we’re about to go into that covered bridge, doesn’t she do it again!"" 

The old man JUMPS up, startling us, and he WHINNIES loudly!  We look over at Peter, who is captivated by what’s going on, and we are immediately redirected to the antics of this old-timer galloping, bucking, rearing, snorting, and pulling, imitating the horse’s actions this time instead of his own to control it.  We watched, wide eyed until he sat down.

He mopped his brow, caught his breath, sipped his coffee and quietly, flatly, resignedly stated,

“That’s THREE.”

And then he slowly and dramatically silently play acted;  pulling a gun out of his pocket, loading a bullet, cocking the imaginary gun, aimed precisely away from us, and yelled,

“BANG”

We ALL startled.

""I shot that horse, and let her fall dead down the embankment.  We walked home in silence, leaving the wagon behind.""

Thinking that was the end of the story, we grimaced.  Looking at Peter, back to each other, then around the cafe -- still no one else had come in, and it was awkward.

""Well, it doesn’t end there, you see, when we got home, my new bride, she pouted and sulked.  I put on a fire, set the kettle on for a boil.  She just sat there.  Wouldn’t say a word.  Shock, I suppose.""  

""We had some tea, and then I went round to the neighbour’s to borrow his horse to retrieve my wagon, and didn’t she insist that she come along, still quiet as a mouse.  We walked that horse back up the road to the bridge, and there was my wagon, and that’s when she first spoke to me again."" 

He reached into his back pocket for his wallet and took out a 10 dollar bill, laying it on the bar securing it under his nearly empty cup.  Then he opened his wallet wide to show us a very old black and white photo of a plain woman in a simple wedding dress holding a small nosegay.  

""That’s how she looked on our wedding day.  The day that she left me at Crooked Creek Covered Bridge # 3.""

""You see when she finally broke her silence she cried, she nagged, she whined, she complained, she just wouldn’t stop talking saying things like …..”what kind of a honeymoon is this?  First, your impatience with an old horse, your temper, walking all that way on the muddy road in my beautiful dress….she rattled on and on.  Oh I listened.  I took it all.  When she got eventually got winded, and fell silent again, I simply said to her, I said.

We met when I was 23 and he was 22. I was freshly single and he was in no place to start something serious so we kinda just were flirty friends. After a couple months of hanging out a few times and often going home w each other after the bar he pulled away. I called him out next time he tried to talk to me. And he said he started to catch feelings but wasn’t ready for anything. 

Fast forward we start being friendly again for another few months and then we got closer and started hanging out every week. He started to pull away again and it hurt me and made me realize I like him more than what we’ve been doing so I ended things with him and said it’s because I want more. He understood and we stopped talking. A few months later he sees me at the bar and he’s drunk. Says he wanted to fight for me and that he missed me and wants a relationship and doesn’t want to see other girls. 

He texts me a week after that asking me to get ice cream I clarified I don’t want anything casual and he said how in the past he wasn’t ready but he is now. Fast forward we go on a date and it went well but he started pulling away SUPER fast after. And so I pulled away. We stopped talking within 2 weeks of the date. And we didn’t talk for 5 months. 

He then reached out. (We are now me 25 and him 24) he said how sorry he was how he regrets not trying harder, how he wants me and that I check all his boxes and he’s really ready for something. Basically says all the right things. I go “I need actions not just words” and he PROVES HIMSELF. For 2 months. Taking me on dates, bringing me coffee to work, told his family about me, all the things even bought me flowers and came over on Valentine’s Day. But all the while not pushing things and making sure I was comfortable with everything and with the past we were taking things.

Then I go on vacation for a week and. Like clock work…he… pulls away. I say how I feel him pulling away again. He says how he doesn’t think he’s ready for a serious relationship and that his feelings aren’t where they should be.

Like what…. The fuck..??? I’m confused!!!

Side note: in the whole 2 yrs we’ve been on and off we’ve only hooked up 5x. So I really don’t think it was sex related. ",1,1745172591.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

1k3sosy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1k3sosy/i_am_in_pain_i_deserve_it_it_hurts/,I am in pain. I deserve it. It hurts.,"This would be my first break up the first official one my relationship of three years has come to an end and it was my fault. I have never felt this kind of pain before. I am sad. But I deserve it.

I met my girlfriend three years ago and she’s the best thing to ever happen to my life, but I didn’t realize it until the break up. She would always put me first. If I said I was tired she would surprise me with coffee, she would make time to see me even if it’s inconvenient or out of her way. She loved me. I was a very introvert person but she was someone to get me out of my comfort zone. Throughout the relationship, I would notice some things about her. She’s very clumsy. She always forgets things, she always drops things, she makes decisions based on impulse without thinking things through, and that was the first thing I noticed that we were different. 

Because of this, I think I started to get annoyed, annoyed in a way that I cared about her. For example she has a bad habit of switching lanes without shoulder, checking and I would always call her out for it, but she always does and whenever she does, it just makes me angry because I want her to be safe. There are other times where it’s like just forgetting her key cards at home for the gym where we would have to turn back and get it when it was unstaffed and the time that she was in a call with me saying how windy it was when we were on our way to the gym in both of our separate cars. Then when she opened her door, she just let it go causing a dent in my car. These little things. So many things like this happen and I get so repetitive that I started getting annoyed. 

It started to get annoying and frustrating. I think it became a habit and then at some point nearly 2 years later I started to feel like I was babysitting her, but my anger just kept getting worse. From here on now, I would just get angry to the point where I would get mad and yell at her calling her names like how dumb she is how stupid she is and how she doesn’t think. She would usually always cry and apologize. Well, I will just keep making it bigger. Throughout the time I felt like I was losing interest because of that, but I still love being around her and liked her presence, but the things that I do, like my anger, the fact that I never see her friends or parents, and how I gradually stopped taking her out or on a date, got to her. 

Fast-forward to a month ago she finally said the words, that she doesn’t think this is working out. At that point, I agreed and I was fine because I’ve had these thoughts in my head for a while, but then she kept talking and then it hurt me. It finally got to me. I knew that she put up with all the yelling and me calling her names and all that kind of stuff, but I never knew how bad it was. She explained me the things that hurt her how I would never show up to events with her when her friends and their significant others are presence, but I’m not how I never take her out anymore. How her parents always ask about me, but I never make any efforts to see them. (I live out of town 45 minutes away- not an excuse but sometimes a factor). How she always drives over to my house to see me when I would rarely do the same. To be honest, I am a naturally shy person so meeting new people like her friends, and even interacting with her parents makes me nervous. There was more like that.

But the thing that got me was this. She said that whenever I’d get mad over the little things when she’s being “clumsy” that she would take everything in. Even though she was apologizing she couldn’t use her voice because she thought I was gonna get only more mad and she was scared of that. She said that if something happened on Monday, she would think about it every day and can’t sleep over it thinking about it for the next few days. She would think about things that she wanted to say, but couldn’t so she just has to play it in her head during the night. She also said every time she tries to talk to me and communicate these feelings, I would always shut her out, which was true.

My heart sank, and it’s still sinking so deep and it hurts. Why was I like this? How can I do this to someone who I appreciate and loved. Specially when she’s been nothing but good to me. Every day since a month ago, when she said this, I have been suffering and thinking of all the scenarios I can think of when I was mean to her, when I was yelling at her, when I was calling her names, when I would tell her to stop talking, when I would tell her to shut up, when I would ignore her. This is the biggest lesson I have ever learned and it’s eating me. Every day I can see her crying in my head vividly. How can I see her crying so clear now when I was blinded by my actions back then. 

A month ago, she labeled this as a break. Since then we’ve been talking, we’ve been talking more actually, something that I gradually stopped doing as much throughout the three years. We’ve also been hanging out for the past month post break (-up), and yes we have been intimate and kissing. We’ve been going out for food, going to the gym together like the usual routine. But she keeps saying that this would be the last time after each time we see each other and the last time, but it becomes more serious each time. Anyways, two weeks in this break, I found out that she had told people that it was a break up, which I was not aware of. Kind of sucks. Since then every night, our texts would turn into talks. I always ask her if she would reconsider trying again. But she’s kept saying no. She thinks I will just go back to the way I was and she doesn’t want to invest time because of it. She has every reason to think that. 

I could never hurt her again the way I did. Every single day since our break (up) I would replay the memories of her crying and trying to use her voice in my head, all the times that I was being mean to her. I can’t let that happen again, either to her or to whoever it may be in the future. Like I said, this is the biggest lesson in my life. The break up hurts, but it hurts more knowing how much I actually hurt her.

But after all this, after thinking that I thought I I was better off alone when I was in the relationship. After constantly thinking about how I have to babysit her. I feel like I want to try again. I can’t tell if it’s because I want to make it up to her for treating her bad. For not treating her the love that she deserved. Or the fact that me hurting her finally made me realize how much I truly loved her. I don’t know. I know that I still love her a lot and I miss her so much everyday. I just feel so bad and it hurts. I don’t know what to do. I think I really do want her back but she’s made up her mind.

I use filtered water for everything, drinking cooking, my animals, making coffee, so even with just me, I go through quite a bit of water a day. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for a decent system that is also pretty easy to clean (meaning you can remove and actually clean all the important parts)?

I know that everyone loves Aquatru, but I've had a horrible time with algae in the spout that that goes into the clean water tank despite cleaing the unit with soap and water every single week since I've owned it.
I found the customer service to be horrible, at one point even advising me to take the unit apart to clean it. When I asked for specific instructions to do so, they told me even though they recommended it, they do not advise it and I would be doing so at my own risk. They originally said they would replace the unit, but than told me they expected the problem to recur and just gave me a refund. 

All that say, they will not be getting anymore of my money. 

Any recommends beyond Aquatru?

1k3secm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disappeared/comments/1k3secm/the_last_jar_of_peaches/,The Last Jar of Peaches,"For months after the funeral, I ate like a ghost.  
Mom’s preserves sat untouched in the pantry—quince jelly, pickled beets, the last jar of peaches she’d canned weeks before the crash. I survived on gas station coffee and vending machine granola bars, punishing my body for outliving hers.

Then, one October morning, I found the note.

It was tucked inside her old cast-iron skillet, rusting under the stove. Her looping script:  
*“When the world feels heavy, feed your bones. Start with the skillet. End with salt.”*

I stared at the peaches. Their syrup glowed like liquid amber in the dawn light.

**The First Meal**  
I cooked like she taught me—no measuring.  
Thick-cut bacon in the skillet. Eggs fried in the grease. Peaches warmed beside them, their sweetness cutting through the smoke.

I ate on the porch steps, the way we used to. A cardinal sang from the bare maple. For the first time in a year, I tasted something besides guilt.

**The Turning**  
I followed the rhythm of her kitchen:

* Breakfast: Steak charred at the edges, fat crisped to gold.
* Lunch: Salmon skin crackling like autumn leaves.
* Dinner: Liver seared quick, with onions caramelized slow.

No counting. No laughs . Just meat, fire, and the notebook where I scribbled her old recipes—*“Add rosemary if you’re sad. Cayenne if you’re angry.”*

My hands stopped shaking. My sleep grew deeper than winter frost.

**The Letter**  
Yesterday, I finally opened Mom’s last email. Sent three hours before the semi crossed the centerline.

*“Found this group called Carnimeat—weird name, right? But their meal plans… Remind me of how Grandma ate. Simple. Strong. Let’s try it together when I’m home. Love you to the moon and back.”*

**The Jar**  
Tonight, I’ll empty the peaches.  
Wash the glass. Fill it with bone broth instead.

And when I drink it tomorrow, steaming and rich, I’ll whisper to the quiet kitchen:  
*“Carnimeat wasn’t a diet. It was the love you left behind.”*

Before my twenties, I used to be a heavy sleeper. I could fall asleep deeply at any time of the day—even after drinking coffee or Red Bull. But one summer, I reversed my sleep schedule. I stayed up all night watching movies and slept during the day.  

When school started again, I tried to get back to a normal routine. However, I noticed that my sleep quality was never the same. I started having cervical pain, always on the right side of my head. It begins in my neck and goes up behind my head.  

Since then—14 years later—I’m still dealing with the same problem. I wake up feeling unrefreshed, like I haven’t slept at all. I feel exhausted, and my head, neck, and shoulders are extremely tense, making it hard to focus or work during the day.

I did a sleep apnea test, but the results were normal.  

Has anyone experienced something similar? For context, I have severe anemia and very low ferritin. Recently, I’ve also noticed that my jaw pops when I wake up. I tried using a mouthguard at night, but it didn’t help.

I’ve been friends with this person for 30 years. We met through a volunteer organization we were both involved with for many years. My friend has always been quite high-strung and generally doesn’t go out of their way to build many relationships within the group. I’m more outgoing and have made close friendships with many of the other volunteers. Still, my friend and I were always seen as a pair — people thought of us as very close.

About five years ago, I became seriously ill and had to stop volunteering. During that time, my friend — let’s call them Jo — visited me regularly. However, I received only the occasional, very formal text from other volunteer friends, which struck me as odd. Still, I was too unwell to question it much at the time.

I shared with Jo how sad and isolated I felt — how I missed the other volunteers and was hurt that no one had stayed in touch. I even told Jo I was worried I might have unknowingly upset someone. I was emotional about it and cried in front of Jo more than once. Jo dismissed my concerns, saying I was being overly sensitive and that everyone was just busy with their own lives. I grieved these friends. One in particular Alex. 

Fast forward to recently, I reconnected with Alex — for coffee (the reason they reached out had nothing to do with Jo). During our chat, Alex revealed they were very upset because they had been told not to contact me by Jo and felt they weren’t allowed to see me.  I was shocked and asked what they meant. It turns out Jo had told Alex and others I was too fragile and sensitive, and that it was best not to reach out — and if they did, to keep it brief and by text only. Because Jo and I were seen as so close, everyone took their word for it. Alex is now upset and I’m devastated. 

Just to be clear Jo knew I wanted to see these friends, and that I was hurt by the lack of contact and that I was seeing many non volunteering work friends regularly.  

Jo and Alex still have to work together so can’t say much to Jo. ",1,1745171525.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

(Love you Charlotte!)
(And Mike too!)

So there’s this guy I’ve been seeing for a few months in late 2023 - early 2024, then we broke up/broke it off over a misunderstanding…
Basically I started catching feelings for him but I wasn’t sure if he just wanted to stay “causal” or not, so I “broke up with him”. 
(My whole spiel was how “I wanted more than this” (meaning a situationship)
and he said “I can’t do more than this”. So that was it.
I cried, he dropped me home, I cried more.)

A couple weeks later I messaged him. I said “I know it doesn’t matter now, but were you dating other people while we were seeing each other?” He said obviously not, since I asked him to be exclusive, he would never.
A few months after the breakup we somehow ended up on the phone. I think I drunk texted him?! Haha anyway…I asked if we could give it another shot cause he said he won’t be going anywhere and let him know if I changed my mind…He mentioned something about how I hurt his feelings when I accused him of cheating. I didn’t know what he meant, cause you can’t cheat on someone you’re not in a relationship with??? So I was like waaaaaaiiit a minute!!
I asked him if he thought we were together. He said yes, of course. I asked him to be exclusive?! That’s when I told him I didn’t know, in my mind we were just dating without labels and in my mind being exclusive is not necessarily a relationship.
(I’m stupid, I know, don’t come at me please!LOL) and I only broke up with him because I wanted to be his gf but he said “he cant do more” so I didn’t want to get my feelings hurt…ahhh. I swear this breakup was one of the worst I’ve ever had cause it got me twice in the feels and it was literally the biggest misunderstanding of MY LIFE. Anyways. I explained, he understood, I begged to give it another go, but he said I hurt him with that text, so we didn’t get back together. 
Then I asked him out in August/September (this is like 6 months after the breakup) and he said he would like to catch up but wouldn’t be into meeting up if it was about us getting back together. I said I was thinking about a catchup, I told him I didn’t want to put any pressure on neither of us. The timing was never right though so I haven’t seen him for over a year now.

Out of the blue he asked me to meet for a coffee. I met him today, and I’ve no idea what’s going on. I didn’t think today was a date, more like that “catch up” (since he was so adamant on that before). We met, quick hug, had a great conversation about how both of us were doing and just had a really nice time.
But then he gave me “The Look”. That look which you’d only ever get when someone has feelings for you. When you lock in on each other and there’s not just a spark but full on fire…he also commented on how I was looking at him, but come on…if you were sitting across from him you’d know I can not be blamed for that! 

Anyway, he was a gent, walked me to my bus, we hugged each other goodbye and that was it. I’m so confused. Should I ask him what he wants? Should I wait until he tells me what he wants?
To complicate the situation he’ll be traveling for work for months now - with very little time spent at home - so I don’t even know if there’s a point of talking about dating let alone a relationship.


Info I couldn’t work into the story:
•(we’re late 20s-early 30s)
•when we talked last week I told him I was still working on getting over him and the fact how I self sabotaged the whole relationship…This was straight before he asked to meet up…so I think it’s implied that I wasn’t fully over him yet he made the choice to ask me out.
•He’s also very respectful of me and he’s not the type who’d use me as an emotional or sexual ego booster
•I am painfully aware how communication wasn’t our strong suit the first time round (to say the least lol), so I know if there’s anything for us in the future I’ll have to be very direct and honest with him, but I don’t wanna do that unless I know there is something in the future for us…it’s like a catch 22 I guess?",2,1745171493.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I’m Jewish so this holiday isn’t something I grew up celebrating, and frankly I’m at the point now where I’m putting in the same effort to his holidays that he puts into mine (which is nothing, except gifts he designates for Chanukah). 

This morning he gets up and he’s all sulky. He tells me to take the bandage off the dogs foot and re do it, then goes out to the deck for his smoke and coffee. I’m struggling to care for the dogs foot alone, he’s not very cooperative, and he’s nipping at my hands as I’m trying to unwrap it, clean it, and rewrap it - yesterday it took two of us to accomplish. So I’m frustrated, and I take the dog out to him and say I can’t do this here’s the dog I have to use the washroom and he’s hurting me. Apparently that was the wrong thing to do because now he’s screaming at me, telling me I’m abusive and how dare I talk to him this way, and I didn’t even do something for Easter so next Chanukah I better buy my own presents. 

Now he says I’m gaslighting him because I was being so rude and mean but he’s just reacting to my disrespect. 

This man yells and screams at me, accuses me of things I didn’t do (doesn’t apologize when he realizes he was wrong), slams doors, slams things on the table. And if I’m even the least frustrated and let him know it, that makes me an abusive cunt bitch who needs to get back in line or he’s leaving.

Our conversations were mostly one-sided, and she frequently canceled our plans — like the time she said she had injured her leg.

She once mentioned her ex had replaced her with another guy and accused me of changing the way I treated her after I found out about her autism. When I got mugged and nearly lost her contact, I noticed she didn’t seem to care and would only reply if I messaged her first.

She would often talk about her cats and got upset when a cousin brought up that she used to go drinking with her ex. When I invited her to watch a movie, she initially declined, saying she was too shy, but later agreed. We kissed and spent the afternoon together, but soon after, she started acting distant, kept her phone hidden, and only gave me her Instagram after we had broken up.

One time, her sister dropped her off at my place, and when I commented that she wasn’t going out with me because she was “being complicated,” she got really angry. On another occasion, I criticized a game we were playing and she immediately stopped playing. Even after sweet moments, like when she gave me chocolate, she would soon bring up the idea of breaking up.

She invited me to a party, later said she wasn’t going anymore, but changed her mind again. I asked if I could come earlier, but she insisted I should only arrive at 6 PM. I went earlier anyway, and her sister saw me and invited me upstairs. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend, but later made a joke: “Let’s download an app to help you find a hot girl.”

After an argument, I ended the relationship, she cried and blocked me. Later on, she texted me saying she missed me. We started talking again until I found her profile on a dating app. When I confronted her, she claimed she was searching for a friend’s ex.

Even after that, I told her I loved her. She invited me to her mother’s birthday, but I didn’t go. Her mom later called me, asked if I loved her daughter, and even invited me for coffee. Later, my ex told me her father was upset with me. I felt bad, vented about it online, and she saw the post.

With insane tuition costs and jobs not always needing degrees, is grinding through uni a scam, or does it still open doors? What’s your take?","Here’s my personal take on it, and I’m gonna break it down so you see the whole picture.

College, man, it’s not the golden ticket it used to be, and I’m not just blowing smoke. Tuition’s through the roof, tons of jobs don’t even require a degree anymore, and the whole system often feels like a giant money grab. But, it’s not a one-size-fits-all answer, and I’m gonna lay out why it’s usually a bad deal, though not always. Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers, because that’s where this thing gets real.

The cost of college has gone bananas. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, back in 1980, you could go to a public four-year school, cover tuition, fees, room, board, everything, for about $9,400 in 2020 dollars. Today, that same school’s gonna set you back $22,200 a year. Private colleges? Good luck, we’re talking $50,900 on average. Meanwhile, middle-class wages have barely budged since the ’70s, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So, families are paying way more for a degree while earning about the same. The result? Student loan debt’s ballooned to $1.7 trillion, crushing 45 million Americans, according to the Federal Reserve. The average borrower’s stuck with $37,000 in loans, with monthly payments eating up 10-20% of their paycheck. That’s not an investment, it’s a ball and chain.

Now, some folks will yell, “But a degree gets you a better job!” Hold up, not so fast. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 41% of college grads are underemployed, stuck in jobs that don’t need a degree, like serving coffee, working retail, or driving for Uber. Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce found 70% of grads end up in fields unrelated to their major. So, you’re telling me it’s worth dropping $100,000, maybe $200,000, plus four years of your life, to maybe land a job you could’ve snagged with a high school diploma? That’s not a smart bet, that’s a slot machine.

Let’s talk about what you’re giving up, because it’s not just about the money. Those four years in college, you’re not earning a paycheck, you’re not building real-world skills, you’re not getting a head start. Compare that to learning a trade. Electricians, plumbers, welders, they’re in crazy demand, pulling in $60,000 to $80,000 a year, no debt, per the BLS. Apprenticeships pay you to learn, no tuition required. Or look at tech, coding bootcamps cost $10,000 to $20,000, take 3-6 months, and can land you a $90,000 gig as a software developer. Big players like Google, Apple, Tesla, they’re ditching degree requirements for tons of roles, caring more about what you can do than what’s on your diploma. The kid who skips college and starts working at 18 is miles ahead of the grad drowning in debt at 22.

It’s not just the money, though, it’s what’s happening on campus. Colleges aren’t the free-thinking hubs they claim to be, they’re often ideological bubble factories. A 2021 survey from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education showed 66% of students feel some topics are too hot to touch on campus. Professors lean hard one way, 6-to-1 left-leaning, per the Higher Education Research Institute, and a lot of classes push activism over actual learning. You’re not learning how to think, you’re being told what to think. Why shell out six figures for that when you can read great books, take cheap online courses, or learn from real-world mentors?

That said, college isn’t a total scam for everyone. If you’re dead-set on being a doctor, lawyer, engineer, or professor, you need that degree, no question. BLS data shows doctors make $200,000 and up, engineers start at $80,000 to $100,000. For those paths, college is the gatekeeper, and it pays off. But even then, the system’s bloated. Why’s a pre-med kid forced to take random literature classes to pad the university’s wallet? Slim it down, cut the fluff, and you’d save time and cash.

People love to push the “intangible benefits” of college, like networking, personal growth, the whole “college experience.” Sure, but at what cost? You can network for free on LinkedIn, at industry events, or on platforms like X. Personal growth? Start a business, travel, tackle real challenges, that’ll grow you faster than a lecture hall. The “experience”? Parties and dorm life don’t justify a lifetime of debt. And get this, 30% of students don’t even graduate within six years, per the National Student Clearinghouse. So, a ton of folks are paying for nothing but a hangover.

Here’s the dirty secret, the college system runs on fear. Parents, teachers, society, they all scream, “You’re a loser without a degree!” But the data says otherwise. Look at entrepreneurs, 40% of Fortune 500 CEOs didn’t go to elite schools, and guys like Elon Musk or Peter Thiel, they laugh at the system. Thiel’s got a fellowship paying kids $100,000 to ditch college and build startups. Success comes from hustle, skills, and grit, not a fancy piece of paper.

So, here’s my advice, if you’re 18, treat your future like a business plan. If college is the only way to your dream, like becoming a surgeon, go for it, but pick a school that won’t bankrupt you, hustle for scholarships, avoid loans like the plague. If you just want a “good job,” skip the four-year grind. Learn a trade, take online courses on Coursera or Udemy for peanuts, or jump into an industry that values results over credentials. Build a portfolio, network like crazy, let your work talk. The internet’s made knowledge free, Harvard’s lectures are on YouTube, and X is a goldmine for connecting with pros.

In 2025, the college game’s on shaky ground. Tuition keeps climbing, AI’s eating entry-level jobs, and employers are catching on that degrees don’t mean much. It’s only worth it if you play it smarter than the system plays you. Otherwise, you’re not investing in yourself, you’re handing your future to bureaucrats. Make your move, but don’t fall for the hype, the real world’s waiting, and it doesn’t care about your GPA.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",1,1745170539.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,1,1.0,False

1k3rwv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1k3rwv4/an_amazing_time_on_the_valiant_lady/,An amazing time on the Valiant Lady,"I’m sitting at the airport after an incredible voyage on the Valiant Lady, so I thought I’d go ahead and add my two cents. I traveled with a group of 7 in our early 40s. Half of us were new to VV.  Here’s my thoughts. Prepare for stream of consciousness:

1. The room: I decided to be cheap and get an insider cabin because sleeping in the cold and darkness is important to me. I had read that the balcony rooms got warm, so I was looking to avoid that at all costs because I knew I wouldn’t spend much time in the room. I think it ended up being the right decision for me. My room was very well-located and it was quiet because I only had 2 neighbors (9th floor M). I loved the 9th floor. It was great to be able to take the stairs most of the time. The room was small but unpacking upon arrival and staying organized made it work. Also our stewards did a fabulous job each day. Loved the shower and all the storage in the room. I brought 6 magnetic hooks, which were nice to have but not necessary by any means. Bed was super comfy. Also the vanity!

2. The vibe: I loved it. Everyone was so sweet and friendly. I would describe the vibe as “grown and sexy”. Lots of couples, gays, groups of friends and cool older folks. Only saw one gross couple wearing “gulf of America” T-shirts 🤢. I loved no children. That’s a must. Everything was really nice, high end and well decorated. The restaurants were very beautiful. I felt like VV makes you feel like a baller on their cruise. 

3. The drinks: my husband and I got the unlimited bar package and it was absolutely the right decision for us. The bar tab calculator I used said I would end up spending about the same on a bar package. With unlimited, I tried drinks I normally wouldn’t. I didn’t have to finish anything I didn’t like. I got as many $20 or as close to $20 drinks as I could. I drank fancy juices and fancy coffee only. Since we could get 2 drinks at a time per person I got some drinks for one of my girlfriends too. Most of the restaurants wouldn’t do the drink pairings with unlimited because they said the cost of the item was over $20. We just did it piecemeal and it was fine. Test Kitchen did allow it. Overall having the unlimited drinks package made me feel very free. I didn’t give a shit about any free booze. Didn’t have to worry about getting free champagne at the sail away party etc. I drank what I wanted at all times. Love it and would highly recommend. 

4. Splash of Romance- I did it to get on early with my friends who have status. I also did it to go change our reservations to better times. Even though I went straight to razzle dazzle upon boarding, I was only able to make a couple of changes because of our group size. Because of the trouble, they sent a bottle of champagne to our room which was really sweet. All the times ended up being fine anyways so I worried for nothing. :) In terms of the other offerings, shake for champagne was awesome. We did it on the last night sitting out on the deck on the side of the ship. My friend did one in the karaoke room. We didn’t have time to go to the spa. The treats in the room were nice. I’m glad it wasn’t every day. Didn’t go to the special event bc again I didn’t have to chase free booze. Overall I would do it again to spend max time on the ship. 

5. The service- I thought it was great. In particular the servers in the restaurants were absolutely fantastic and kind. Our group was a little boisterous at times and they were just amazing. It was apparent to me that everyone on the ship  was working their tail off to make sure we had a great time. I was really impressed by the whole operation and everything it took to make it happen honestly. I felt bad not tipping because so many people were great, but I loved not having to tip and got used to that real quick. I did tip our stewards because that service felt really personal and their work made it so that I was comfortable in that tiny ass room. 

6. The food- I loved it. There was something for everyone. The food in Bimini was particularly yummy as was that dragon frozen drink. Faves were the fried chicken at gunbae, gnocchi and steak at extra Virgin, dessert at test kitchen, oysters and desserts at the wake. I also really liked the sushi at the galley and the shrimp at the dock. Not saying there were no duds but most of what we ate was really delish. 

7. The activities- we loved the theme nights and bringing outfits for them. PJ party outside was super fun. The diva is gorgeous and her show was hilarious. Scarlet Night was a blast. We loved the music there and at the sail away party. We Fancy was really fun and the happenings cast killed it. I adored to watch them dance. We did Lotería and it was a drunken good time. Loved trivia with Megan the flare. She was my fave on the happenings cast and an incredible dancer. Bimini was great. I do wish there was bar service to the pool for non-cabana people. I didn’t know that wasn’t a thing, but honestly it may have kept me from overdoing it. Also loved the Magnets. They are very talented and we got a cute photo with them after the show. Absolutely loved karaoke and the social club. I went to trivia by myself one morning and made new friends. It was easy to make friends on the ship! Everyone I interacted with was very happy and friendly. 

8. The bad- it was hard to find the bathrooms. The restaurant reservation situation is a pain. Thankfully my friend stayed up until midnight like it was damn Black Friday, and he totally saved our butts. We paid $90 for premium wifi and that only got us one device. No music in the room. wtf. They need to make those tvs smart or have some way to play music in there. I didn’t know I had to come with music pre downloaded. This is why we got the premium wifi. Did experience some feeling of the boat. I brought meds but you’re not supposed to drink on those. Motion sickness bracelets did the trick, but I kinda think I only needed them bc of hangovers. 

Overall review: 10/10 should have booked the next cruise on the boat but they only give you $150 now.

1k3rvxf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3rvxf,Ascaso Steel duo plus 15 vs 20amp and a couple other questions,"Hello everyone.

I've come across a lightly used steel duo plus 20 amp here in Canada.  I have a 20amp circuit in the kitchen which is great.

But I was looking at new prices/versions and it seems now  there is a 15amp version as standard that is meant to give much better steam power (+30%)?  But I'm confused if I'm reading that right as I'd have thought higher amperage would give more power?

Also, I currently use a thermablock in my bambino plus.  And it doesn't make even two repeatable coffees in a row.  It seems the temperature can't be maintained with their thermablock system.

Is this an issue with the duo plus?  I'm just craving consistency basically.

My only other option is the Profitec Move.  But that's $2999+taxes ($3359).  This used duo plus is $2300.  And I think I can get it a little cheaper so will be around $1000-$1200 cheaper, which is a lot of coffee beans.  It's still got 6 months warranty too, and 4+ years on the thermablock.

I have considered uno or profitec go too as I only make one latte and one Americano a day.  But this duo plus used is tempting.

I do prefer slightly the look of the MOVE and it's been getting stellar reviews compared to some mixed reviews on the ascaso but I really like the side loading water tank of the duo.

1k3runo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocryitoutsleep/comments/1k3runo/psa_struggling_with_30minute_baby_naps_heres_what/,[PSA] Struggling with 30-minute baby naps? Here’s what actually helped us (no cry-it-out required),"Does your baby wake up like clockwork after 30 minutes? You finally get them down, breathe a sigh of relief... and boom, they're awake before you can even reheat your coffee.

Short naps are super common — but also super frustrating. The good news? There *is* a fix, and it doesn't involve CIO.

💡 **The problem usually lies in wake windows.**  
Basically, if your baby is either *under-tired* or *overtired* going into a nap, it’s harder for them to stay asleep through a full cycle (which is \~30–45 min).

* If the wake window is **too short**, they don’t have enough sleep pressure.
* If it’s **too long**, their body starts releasing cortisol (stress hormone), and they struggle to link sleep cycles.

🕰️ **The magic ingredient: Optimal Wake Times**  
Here’s a general guideline that really helps dial things in:

* 0–6 weeks: 40–60 mins
* 6–12 weeks: 60–80 mins
* 3–7 months: 80–120 mins
* 7–12 months: 120–180 mins

👉 Pro tip: The first wake window of the day is usually your baby's sleepiest time — but don’t let it be *too* short or naps can stay stuck at 30 mins.

🛠️ **Things that helped us stretch naps past the dreaded 30-minute mark:**

1. **Adjust wake windows** – Tweaking by 5–10 mins at a time. That alone can make a *huge* difference.
2. **Full feedings** – Make sure baby isn't snacking can helps both naps *and* night sleep.
3. **Nap environment** – Dark room, white noise (not music!), cool temp (68–72°F), and bright wake times to anchor their circadian rhythm.
4. **Watch for sleepy cues, but don’t live and die by them** – Rubbing eyes and yawning are helpful, but sometimes babies are already overtired by then, which is why awake windows are helpful.
5. **Cut down on motion naps** – Offering solely swinging and stroller naps can make crib naps harder.
6. **Wait before intervening** – If baby wake up at 30–40 min, you can give them 2–5 mins to try resettling if they aren't crying. Sometimes they surprised us.
7. **Help when needed** – Don't stress about independent sleep early on. If baby needed some help to fall asleep on time, offer it. Preventing overtiredness > trying to force self-soothing too soon.

✨ TL;DR:  
30-minute naps don’t have to be forever. Tweaking wake windows, aiming for full feedings, and creating a calm nap space can work wonders — no cry-it-out necessary.

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we talk about self-care here—the tiny, *non*\-Instagrammable things that anchor us when life feels heavy. For months, I was stuck in “bare minimum” mode: work, eat, sleep, repeat. No candles, no playlists, no pauses. Then I stumbled on a post here where someone said they’d started lying in sunbeams on their floor like a cat. **A cat!** It hit me: *Survival mode makes us forget how to be soft.*

So I started stealing tiny habits from people around me. Here’s what’s helping:

# My Anti-Survival Mode Toolkit

1. **Floor Time™** When sunlight pools on my living room rug at 2 p.m., I lie there. No phone, no thoughts—just breathing. Sometimes I stretch like I’m auditioning for *Cats: The Midlife Crisis Edition*.
2. **The Playlist Trick** I made a 3-song morning mix (currently: Lizzo, a lofi cover of *Clair de Lune*, and the *Ted Lasso* theme) to brush my teeth to. Dancing optional but encouraged.
3. **Baby Face Yoga (My Guilty Joy)** Okay, full transparency: I downloaded this app on a whim. It’s goofy as heck—you make weird faces at your phone camera to “lift” your cheeks or “smooth” your forehead. But doing it for 5 minutes while my coffee breaks? It’s become this weirdly grounding ritual. Not because I care about wrinkles, but because *it makes me laugh*. (Pro tip: Do the “Lion Pose” in the mirror and try not to snort.)

# Why These Work

* **They’re Dumb (In the Best Way)**: If a habit feels too serious, I won’t stick with it. Face yoga is basically adult playtime.
* **No “Shoulds” Allowed**: I don’t do Floor Time daily. Sometimes survival mode wins. But when I *do* remember? It’s like hitting a reset button.
* **Sensory Overload (But Chill)**: Cold floors, warm sun, silly faces, citrus hand cream—tiny jolts to remind my body, *“Hey, we’re alive.”*

# What I’m Curious About

* **Your “Cat Mode” Habits**: Do you have a Kevin-the-sloth equivalent? A weird ritual that just *works*?
* **Face Yoga Skeptics**: Anyone else try it? I need solidarity—my roommate walked in mid-“Fish Lips” pose and I’ve never recovered.
* **Survival Mode Lifelines**: What’s your go-to when even tiny habits feel impossible?

*“Some days my self-care is a 10-step skincare routine.*  
*Most days it’s remembering to hydrate and not hate myself for forgetting.”* – A work in progress.",1,1745170217.0,SelfCareCharts,0,1.0,False

My character this time is named Bellamy. He's a mixed orc and elf orphan who was raised as a servant/slave in a now defunct noble house. For employment, he uses his labor lore, but he also is a cook. When he was young, they would forage for berries for the household, but they could keep the bruised and poor quality berries. They would make them into jams as one of the few treats they could enjoy.

He knows the group through various means. He sells his jams to businesses like the coffee shops, so he's met Vittoria in passing. He lives amongst the tieflings because he's somewhat of an outcast, and has used Niccolo as a job lead from time to time. 

Since joining the group, he's really taken to Cesare as a mentor, and someone who can teach him elven lore, which he is taking at level 5. He grew up more connected to his orc side, being guided by an older orc in the servant house named She'satha.

He is a fighter because I thought the group could use a fighter, but now they have one. He uses a meteor hammer. As a servant or slave, it was typical to find yourself being chained and it was part of their servant culture to learn to fight with their chains. They might find themselves accosted by wolves, bandits, or other fiends while having to work. They would have to band together to defend themselves with the few tools they had. A pitchfork, or shovel was relatively simple to improvise, but if all they had was a chain with a weight at the end then that would be what they used to keep themselves alive.

Those chains would be far more bulky and less agile compared to the weapon he uses today, but the concepts and base stances are similar. 

Anyway, I was listening to episode 42 and Rick was talking about telling a story about a romance between an elf and orc because he joked that Cesare's sister in law is 1/8 orc. I thought if my character were actually in the story, then maybe we could touch upon that history, but my story is a very different one. 

Bellamy is older, in his 50s, which is really old for an orc, quite old for a half orc, but quite young for a half elf. He doesn't understand if he should feel old, or young, if he should look to settle down and start a family, or he's far too old for such things. He doesn't really fit anywhere, so this is a classic story of found family, and feels quite comfortable amongst the diverse and chaotic group.

1k3rntp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k3rntp/there_were_so_many_hooks/,There Were So Many Hooks,"Ever been hooked by a fishing hook before? Most of the time, you don’t even know it’s there until you see it, stuck right into the back of your hand, leg, wherever else it decides to latch on.

Time to time I think I feel one of those hooks latching onto my right arm and it puts me in a panic every time. I get nightmares of being taken away by them, just pulled out the window and gone.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me go back about 7 months ago.

My name’s Nathan. Back in early August, my grandfather passed away from heart failure at 73. In Newfoundland, that’s pretty rare. Most people don’t even make it that far before heart problems catch up with them.

He was more than just a grandfather to me. He was the reason I made it through a lot of tough times after my father left when I was just 8. He did everything in his power to keep my mom and me afloat and 20 years later, he was still supporting us in every way he could, never asking for anything in return.

Hell, the only reason I didn’t know what happened to him sooner was because he was on his way to celebrate with me. I’d just landed a new job I’d been working toward for months and he wanted to mark the occasion. He hopped in his old truck to grab a small cake, but he passed away at a red light before he could even get home.

He was one of a kind. Losing him felt like part of me was ripped out, leaving a massive hole. After his burial we did what we could to sell whatever he had. House, truck, tools, we just didn’t have space for it and it took some time to pull off, it also hurt a little giving up his things.

That’s when I found his old key ring. They weren’t for his truck, he never had spares for it, but to the cabin he used to own. In Newfoundland, cabins are common. People use them to escape for a while or, for some, to go moose hunting. My grandfather wasn’t much of a hunter, but he’d slip out there every now and then to get away. I remember a few times he took me there one of those trips was when he tried to teach me to drive at 16. That lesson ended quickly when I went just a little too fast and crashed his truck into one of the trees in the area. I’m pretty sure my mom yelled at him the entire day we got back but all he cared about was that I was fine in the end.

The cabin was about an hour outside of his home town, down a dirt road that barely even qualified as a road. You could easily miss it if you weren’t looking for it. It was in the perfect spot, just far enough away from everything, surrounded by trees for cover, but still close enough to the shoreline if you felt like fishing. And now, here I was, holding the only set of keys he had for it.

I didn’t tell my mother about the cabin even though now I wish I did. But at the time, I didn’t know if the cabin had been sold, given to one of us, or just left to rot. The urge to go there one more time before it was potentially taken away from us was stronger than anything else, I had to go.

The plan was simple: I told my mother I was going out of town to meet up with an old high school friend who was getting married soon, but also to clear my head from everything so far. I would be gone for 4 days, enough time to drive there, stick around for a day or two and then drive back without her knowing. She didn’t question it, I booked the time off and I headed out when the time came.

I overpacked of course. Instead of bringing just a few days worth of food and water, I ended up with 6 days worth of water and food. I also brought a fresh bottle of Screech and enough gasoline to keep the small generator my grandfather had up there running the entire time I was there. I did all of this in the next town over just to make sure my mother wouldn’t catch me packing supplies for the cabin.

Once I had everything, I hit the road. I didn’t stop until I reached that dirt road my grandfather had used for years. I’ve always hated that road, it was so bumpy it felt like I was getting whiplash every few minutes. My forgotten cold coffee didn’t stand a chance the moment I got on that dirt road, flying everywhere within the first few minutes and making a mess I couldn’t clean up until I was done getting to the cabin.

Even after all these years seeing the cabin still standing felt surreal. Its bright blue exterior stuck out against the surrounding trees. It wasn’t big, but that was part of its charm. All you needed in a cabin like this was a place to sit, cook, eat, sleep, and well...shit. Anything beyond that was an unnecessary luxury.

Behind the cabin, my grandfather had a small shed where he kept his tools and the generator that powered the lights and mini-fridge. The generator could run for about 10 hours, but I wasn’t planning on running it that long but if I did I brought enough gas to make it last, especially for some late night drinking.

I stepped up to the door, unlocked it and swung it wide open to let in the fresh air. Inside there was a small countertop on the right, enough space to prepare food, and a makeshift sink made from a cheap bucket and a couch to the side tucked into the corner of the cabin’s living room. No plumbing of course, we always had to bring our own water for drinking and washing. There was also a makeshift shower near the shed and an old outhouse a little further out which I had to spray down with bug repellent. The bathroom built in the cabin was nothing more than a seat with a bucket for those frigid winter nights if you didn’t want to freeze your ass off in the snow. No one used it as a bathroom honestly so we just used it as a small storage room.

The cabin only had four windows. One in the front, one in front of the kitchen sink and 2 small ones in the bedroom and bathroom. My grandfather didn’t keep much here, there was a small coffee table, a loveseat and two folding chair. The centerpiece of the cabin, though, was the old wood stove, which had probably been there longer than my grandfather. It was a sturdy and heavy wood stove with a flat top to boil your water for tea or cook any meal you wanted. He always preferred to cook on that thing then any electric stove top we brought even if it meant burning everything that touched it.

There was one other thing in the cabin I had to check though, one thing my grandfather showed me and told me to keep a secret even from my mother. Once you move the couch out of the way you could find two boards in the wall that stuck out from the others that were not nailed in but screwed into the wall. A quick twist with an old screwdriver and I had access to my grandfather’s rifle he had tucked away in the wall for safekeeping.

He knew all about Canadian gun laws and the need to keep ammo and weapons separate, but he didn’t care much for the rules. The rifle he owned wasn’t registered and it was an old Ross rifle, the same kind used by the Newfoundland military in World War 1. The fact that he had one and it still worked amazed me. ""It came with the cabin,"" he told me once, which made me question just how old this cabin really was. I knew the cabin had been fixed up a long time ago but old enough to last since World War 1? For now I just screwed the boards back on and left the rifle there, I had no reason to have it out right now and tucked the couch back in its place to hide it.

Once I was done inspecting the inside of the cabin and headed back outside to grab everything I packed, it was then it started to happen. I didn’t notice the hook hanging there dead center to the door when I was leaving and right away it sliced the right side of my face right on my cheek. It stung like hell and touching where it cut me I could already feel a small bit of blood on my finger tips. I wasn’t sure where it came from but I remember thinking to myself how much it would suck to leave just for a tetanus shot.

I grabbed the line that the hook was attached to, wrapping it around my hand, and gave it a tug, trying to pull it free from wherever it was tied to. But the more I tugged, the less sense it made. I figured it was probably attached to the wall or maybe even the roof for some strange reason but every time I pulled it felt a little to loose

Finally with one good yank I ripped it free, the long, nearly invisible line, dropped in front of me. It was much longer than it should’ve been. I could’ve easily wrapped it around the entire cabin without a problem. I figured it was just an extra bit of line left by my grandfather, or whoever had put it up, who hadn’t bothered to trim it down. I coiled it up, tied it off, and tossed it beside the front door for later. I’d deal with it properly once I was done unpacking the truck.

I was exhausted. I needed food and thanks to that damn hook, a band aid. Unpacking was quick, even setting up the gas generator my grandfather had was easy enough. Once everything was inside and the generator was roaring, I got to work cleaning up and eventually cooked myself dinner. When night rolled around and I was ready to sleep. As much as I wanted to stay awake a little longer my body was begging for a nap after being on the road for so long. So I slipped outside, turned off the generator for the night and headed to the cabin door.

As soon as I reached the door I spotted something at the very edge of my sight. It was pretty dark outside but I could have sworn I saw something at the tree line, so I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight mode, pointing it in the direction I saw whatever it was.

To my surprise I could make out what looked like a moose standing in the distance. Newfoundland is known for its moose population, there are so many now that they’ve become a real problem, especially for drivers. But this was the first time I’d seen a moose near the cabin like this. Now thinking about it, I think this was the first time I’ve seen any animal near the cabin and there was a full grown moose in the distance, maybe looking in my direction.

I quietly stepped inside, locked the door and brushed it off. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was tired and my only focus was getting to bed to enjoy my time at the cabin for the next few days. I had a plan and no moose was going to stop me at this point.

The next morning I was still partly waking up when I went outside to grab some wood for the stove. I was already craving a cup of tea and as I made my way toward the back of the cabin I felt another sudden sting, this time from the top of my right hand. This one stung like hell. I think it was the jolt from it that made me jerk my hand away and made things worse as the hook poked through the other end of my skin. This one was a lot thicker compared to the first one that got me and it stung like hell.

Looking at the hook embedded in my skin only made the pain worse. I knew I had to break the line before I could do anything else and coiled it up a bit in my left hand to give it a tug, trying to pull it free.

Nothing.

In fact, it felt like the line was pulling back slightly as I tried again. I couldn’t figure out where it was tied, but I kept pulling thinking it was probably attached to the roof or something. It didn't take me long to realize the line wasn’t attached to the roof at all this time.

The line was coming from the sky.

For a second I convinced myself the wind must’ve blown it out from a tree or something. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, making it look like the line was hanging from the sky. But deep down I knew what I was looking at and I won’t lie, it scared the hell out of me.

I gathered all my strength and pulled on the line until it snapped much like the first one I found. This line was longer though. I didn’t waste any time and headed inside to grab my pliers. I needed to cut the hook off thanks to the barbed end it had, if I just pulled it out it would just rip through my skin more than anything, but with the hook being thicker this time it took a bit out of me to just cut it in half. I did thankfully, pulling both pieces out and throwing it into the trash.

I wasn’t sure whether I should get it checked out. It was a pretty big hook and who knew how long it had been there? But I also did want to just leave and waste an entire day getting it checked out either. I decided to check my phone and see if I could find a quick answer. Instead I was greeted with no signal, forgetting I was in the middle of the woods where it would be pure luck to get one out here.

I walked all around the inside of the cabin for the smallest signal at first before heading outside, checking every spot near there for anything before finally finding one spot that worked. It was just outside the kitchen window when I spotted the small signal bar pop up and allowed me very slow access to the internet again.

I must have been out there for a little while looking for some kind of quick answer when something caught my eye and nearly jumped out of my skin when I noticed it finally, just barely catching my phone in the process.

About 20 to 30 feet from the cabin, there was a moose, maybe the same one from the night before. It was standing motionless in the thicker part of the trees, just staring in my direction. What really shook me though was how quiet it was.

If you’ve ever seen a moose, you know how loud they can be. These massive animals are hard to miss, especially where the trees are packed together in places. A moose moving around will always make some noise. But this one? It was dead silent.

Something kept telling me in the back of my head that something wasn’t right, something about this moose just felt off as I made my way to the corner of the cabin, my eyes locked on it as I did. The moment I reached the corner I was greeted with something else, another hook. This one thankfully caught the sleeve of my shirt as I tried to walk away. My immediate instinct was to pull away, let it tear through my shirt and just not worry about it, the moment I did I watched as the hook came free before suddenly being pulled straight up into the air and out of sight. I didn’t know what I just saw at first and just stood there trying to see where it went. 

Where it went was up into the sky.

It must have clicked in my head shortly after because when it did I bolted to the cabin door. Something wasn’t right about this cabin suddenly and my first reaction to it all was getting the fuck out of there. I wasn’t going to stick around and find out what the hell was going on, I was going to leave and find out later if I could. I raced back inside and grabbed one of the empty bags I had brought with me, packing it with whatever I could without any real knowledge of what I was grabbing. I was more spooked by this than I thought I was now thinking about it, but god I wished I moved a little faster when I started.

I didn’t even care about the generator. I figured I would leave it, let it run itself out of gas and the problem solved .The need to go back there and shut everything down properly was being overrun by the need to simply leave. I was nearly done packing the bags when I heard it, the kitchen window shattering into a thousand pieces. Glass and wood was thrown into the cabin so suddenly I thought something had exploded behind me, making me jolt away from the sound before turning to it.

The damn moose was there, I knew it was because the moment I looked toward the window I could see just the smallest piece of its antlers poking inside before it pulled it back outside. Before I could react I heard another window smash, then another. For whatever reason the moose outside had smashed almost all of the windows and yet I still could not hear anything from it, not a single step.

""Fuck this,"" I remember muttering to myself.

I shoved the couch out of the way with all my mite and kicked the wall where the boards hid it, shattering them with one good kick. If I had to kill a moose to get out of there then god damn it, that’s what I was going to do.

I grabbed the rifle and grabbed one of the already loaded clips for it. Loading the rifle was difficult but I managed in the end, pulling the slide back then forward again to get it ready. I haven’t used it that much but my grandfather showed me how to properly use it before, nothing changed since then.

I figured if the moose was anywhere it would be near the shed, it did smash out the bedroom and bathroom windows which were close to it so that was where I would check first. With the butt of the rifle to my shoulder i swung the front door open and made my way towards the back end of the cabin. As I got closer I could finally start hearing it or something at least. Something banging on the other side. With a loud pop and bang I realized what it was. The moose was slamming its head into the generator and had killed it. Why the hell it was doing that I had no idea, but I knew I had to act fast.

Reaching the corner of the cabin I was finally in sight of the damn thing but god do i wish I never did now. The moose, this hulking beast of an animal stood tall over the now dead generator, raising its head up high now that it was done beating it to death before slowly turning its head towards me.

One of its antlers had snapped off at the base from repeatedly slamming it into the generator, leaving just a sharp stub sticking out of its head. But that was nothing compared to the rest of the sight.

Its fur was patchy, missing in some places, revealing pale raw skin beneath with spots of rot and decay. The moment it had turned its head towards me I could see a part of its lip was hanging loose, bits and pieces of it torn up and with old blood gunk up. And it’s eyes, god those nearly pure white eyes staring blankly back at me as it stood there.

This moose had been dead for some time now and holding it up were hundreds, maybe thousands of these hooks and lines scattered all across its body, suspending it upwards like a puppet with its feet never actually touching the ground, only looking like it was even on the ground to begin with. All of these super thin lines shot straight up into the air like all of the other ones I had seen by then, controlling every movement this moose made. No wonder it looked off to me when I first spotted it.

I stood there frozen, rifle aimed at the abomination before me, its hollow eyes met mine and in that moment, time felt like it stopped. My breath was trapped in my chest, my hands cold as ice as I held that rifle. I squeezed the trigger before I even understood what was going on and watched as the round landed right into the thing's right eye with a small wet pop before exiting the other side, a small bit of old gunk up blood pouring out where the eye once was. There was no reaction, no twitch, no flinch, nothing. It simply stood there, unfeeling, unaffected by the shot that would have killed most mooseI. I reacted by cocking the gun, pulling then pushing the slide back in place to ready another round as it kept its dead sight on me. The next round hit its rib cage, a small splatter of blood but no exit wound this time as I cocked the rifle yet again.

The best way I can explain how this thing moved is again like a puppeteer simply swung it towards me, lunging forward and forcing myself to jump back out of its reach as it slammed into the corner of the cabin. It bounced off the corner of the cabin like some crazed marionette, its movement odd and awkward at the same time as the hooks attached to it guided it back my way. In my moment of panic I walked quickly backwards, trying to get the rifle up fast enough to take another shot as the gun let out another snap

The bullet hit the rotten piece of the moose's back and I watched as it tore a large chunk off and shot straight up into the sky like trash caught in high winds. The amount of lines and hooks that went with it must have off-balanced the thing, shifting its weight to the side as it once again rammed into the cabin wall with an unsettling force where it paused for a brief moment. I remember my hands were shaky but not enough for me to cock the rifle one more time. The moment the next round was ready I watched in horror as this massive dead beast was simply pulled up into the air and out of sight. It was simply gone.

I frantically looked everywhere for that thing, unsure if it was just gone or waiting for me to fuck up and surprise me. It took me a bit but I considered everything in the cabin a lose as I made a mad dash for the truck, rifle in my left hand while right hand dug in my pocket for the keys, panic making everything so much harder to find them. I had just barely managed to pull the keys free when it returned.

It plummeted from the sky like some sort of twisted Ferris wheel, crashing into the side of the truck with a deafening impact. The impact drove the truck nearly seven feet to the side with enough force to almost flip it on to its side, I was mere inches away from it when it hit the door, forcing me to leap back and fall on my ass before stumbling back to my feet again.

The moose was barely unrecognizable. Both of its shattered antlers were almost nearly gone at this point and the remnants of its skin clung to its body in patches, revealing broken bones, exposed ribs and rotting flesh. Fragments of its skull and ribcage jutted from its body like broken shards of glass.

I tried to raise my rifle once more but before I could fire it was on me. The force slammed into me, pushing me backward until my back crashed into the cabin window and shattering the glass in an instant. The rifle slipped from my hands, and in that brief moment of disorientation, I struggled to catch my breath. There was no time to think, no time to plan, no time to wait. I did the only thing I could, I ran back inside. I sprinted back inside my heart pounding and reached the makeshift sink as the creature crashed into the door. It hit with such force that the wood exploded, splintering and cracking as it attempted to force its way inside. The only way for me to explain the situation was like watching someone control a puppet and trying to make them walk into a small house where the strings could get into, making parts of its limbs just drop and act dead on the spot as the lines attached to it dug into the wood. It struggled to get inside for a while before becoming lifeless, dead in its spot. It didn’t take long before all of the hooks and line attached to the corpse dragged it back outside and straight up in the air once again, not a sound to be made.

The best way I could describe what I was witnessing was like watching someone manipulate a puppet trying to force it to walk into a tiny house, the strings tangled and got caught in the roof and ceiling, causing parts of the puppet’s limbs to suddenly go limp and hang dead as the lines pulled tight against the wood. It struggled for a while, trying to force itself inside but eventually it went completely still, lifeless, frozen in place like a real corpse. It didn’t take long before the hooks and strings that had been attached to its body yanked it back out, lifting it up into the air without a single sound.

I stood there in silence overlooking the chaos that was left behind by this thing, splattering of old rotting blood, small bits and pieces of fur and flesh along with scattered wood and glass from the window and door. My breath was fast, still catching up to everything that happened moments before the silence as I took a few steps forward to look outside. I kept a bit of distance from the doorway still, giving myself enough space in case it came back with another surprise attack as I scanned the area. There was nothing, just dead silence.

That silence lasted only a moment before a loud and sudden *BANG* echoed from outside the cabin as a round from the rifle went off and ripped through the wall beside me before ending up inside the kitchen wall on the other side. Wherever the corpse went it had taken the rifle straight up with it before hitting the ground with such force to set off the loaded round live in the chamber. Won't lie, I think I pissed myself from that honestly.

After both near death experiences I ran to the couch and shoved it in front of the front door before grabbed the old bed and propping it up against the window as well, blocking any sight of that beast if it was to come back before tucking myself into the very corner the couch was in before all of this. It was the safest place in my mind, furthest from the windows and door leading outside where that thing could potentially get me.

I was stuck in this cabin.

I didn’t dare to try and leave as the hours dragged on, day became night and I risked it to get to the wood stove to light it up, giving me some better vision of the area around me inside the cabin. I barely moved, stunned by everything that had led to this as the realization I was stuck here started to leak into my mind. There was nothing I could do but sit here and wait, waiting for something to happen as I made the bottle of Screech my only friend in this world now.

My truck was completely fucked after what that thing did to it and it was the only safe way for me to get out of this place. I couldn’t just run away with a corpse like that flying around here to pounce when it was time, plus how many of those hooks were outside as well? I only bumped into a few of them and all I know they could be anywhere. I was stuck here. I must have drank half the bottle that night, pausing every moment I heard something outside or mumbling to myself about things long past. Did my grandfather know about this? What was controlling that thing outside attacking me? Should I leave a message in case someone finds me? I had so many thoughts running through my mind as I sat there, the glow of the wood stove lighting the room around me as I checked my phone for the time. I don’t remember much in that moment being piss drunk, but seeing my phone somehow gave me the idea of calling for help. I had to shake my drunken mind away and really think of how I was going to pull this off. If I could get a single 911 call out maybe, just maybe I could get someone here to save me. It was a long shot but it was the only shot I had, the only real problem was getting a signal. I knew where I could get even a small one, but that's what made it so much worse to think about it. It was my only chance to get out of here and I had to at the very least try.

My body felt heavy, exhausted even the more I tried to get myself up off the floor, a plan set in stone but unsure if I can even pull it off. Out the kitchen window was all I needed to reach out to, that was all I had to do. I can pre-dial the number and wait until i got a signal before pressing ‘Call’ on the phone to try and contact someone to help, but the more I looked towards the shattered kitchen window the more fearful I became, frightened of that thing just being around the corner and hitting when I was at my weakest.

My hands were shaking as I got the phone ready, only 10% power left was enough to get a phone call out as I dialed in the number. I kept my thumb over the ‘Call’ button on the screen as I crept up to the window and slowly stretched my right arm little by little outside of the wrecked frame. I kept scanning the area, keeping an eye out for the corpse to return and attack me as I reached further and further outside. My hope was fading pretty quickly the further i stretched myself out that window, trying not to cut myself on the glass until I saw it, a green signal bar popping up on the top right of the screen as I press ‘Call’ on the screen. The relief that overcame when I heard the sound of the phone ringing was like a rush, but only for a moment.

The phone slipped from my grasp as a surge of pain coursed through me intense and blinding, as though every nerve ending in my arm was being pulled and twisted. I looked down in horror to see hooks anchoring into my skin, spreading from my shoulder all the way to my fingertips piercing deeper with each pull. Instinctively I tried to wrench myself free, but the hooks resisted, tugging me back with a violent force instead. If my left arm hadn’t been braced against the cabin, I would’ve been dragged right out, pulled into the dark with no hope of escape. The pain was so overwhelming that for a moment I thought I might collapse from sheer agony. 

The pain was unbearable, it felt like I was being ripped apart little by little. Even though I was fighting for my life something in my mind shifted from being frightened to fighting back. I wasn’t going to be some puppet, dragged away and strung up like that damn moose, I was going to get away from this one way or another. With every ounce of strength I had I started to pull with all my might, intense pain jolting through me more and more as I pulled but I couldn’t stop.

I managed to get my foot up on the wall for leverage, giving me extra strength to work with as I started to pull with everything I had. I yanked myself back inside, my body slammed against the floor and came to a stop in the corner where the couch once was as my breathing became ragged, exhaustion taking over me as I laid there.

As the adrenaline started to fade that’s when I felt the full force of the pain.  I had to pull myself up with my left arm before seeing my right arm shredded to pieces. Strips of skin were missing all the way from my shoulder to my fingers, on top of that I had pulled with such force I lost the top of my middle finger and my ring finger, only half of them remained. Blood was rushing with the beat of my heart and as my heart rated increased I had to do what I could in pure agony

The moment was a blur to me, a bad panic of trying to stop the bleeding while thoughts of bleeding out ran through my mind. What I do remember was one idea of just pouring the remaining bottle of Screech over the wounds and shoving my arm into the wood stove, burning the wounds closed to stop the bleeding, but even I knew that was a terrible idea and would have only made more problems. Instead I must have just wrapped it up the best I could and poured I think what was rubbing alcohol all over the cloth I used which turned out to be a bed sheet and a t-shirt before passing out from that alone. Time was a blur at that point. I remember laying on that floor for a long while, other times I remember struggling to open and cook canned and bottle goods I brought with me. I think I even wrote a letter to my mother at one point fearing that I wasn't coming out of this alive. I didn’t think I was at that time. The final night I do remember pretty clearly. The pain in my right arm started to get worse as I laid there may be either half dead or half asleep. The fire in the wood stove had died out and the only thing I could hear was the rustling of the trees from the wind outside. I was ready for death to take me as I laid there but the longer I waited the more light I started to notice. I thought I was hallucinating when this all happened, it wasn’t until I heard the officers voice yell out before coming inside.

Before I knew it I was waking up in a hospital bed, the lights nearly blinding me when I finally woke up. The RCMP officer who spoke to me in the hospital explained that my 911 call did get through. They heard a struggle on the line, but the call dropped before they could track it down properly. They had only a vague idea of where the cabin was, which is why it took them so long to find me. But they found me, just in time.

I told them everything. The hooks, the moose, the damage to my arm, everything. I’m not sure if they believed me but they knew something had happened. The doctors said I was lucky I didn’t bleed out from how much was torn away on my arm. The doctor probably didn’t buy my story either, but that didn’t matter. All he needed to do was help me recover.

I stayed in the hospital for a while. I was too terrified to leave and was convinced that whatever attacked me was still out there. My fear kept me in that sterile room an extra day or two, even though I was physically well enough to go. It wasn’t until my mother insisted I leave that I finally agreed in hesitation and I went to stay with her for a few more days before heading back to my own home.

It's been 7 months since then. 

Writing all of this down has been difficult and doing what I just did was even harder. Part of me wants to believe it was just some twisted figment of my imagination, a way for my mind to shield me from what really happened. But I know what I saw.

The hardest part? I can’t prove any of it anymore.

The cabin is gone.

I just returned from driving out there, hoping for any shred of evidence that it was real. But when I got there it was gone. No remains, no pieces of the cabin, just nothing. It was as if it had never existed. I called everyone in the area and no one knew anything about it, not even the RCMP, who’d investigated the site days after they found me. According to them, the cabin should still be there.

But it wasn’t.

The only thing I found was a single, small fishing hook, tightly tied to a frail line.",6,1745169843.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

My husband says I’m a horrible person to be around,"I (26F) with (34M) have opposing views on owning a dog, a little context we’ve been married 2 years dated for 8 months. We both are previous law enforcement officers and moved on to the oilfield, for better pay and me personally I wasn’t into the politics. Both different departments, I don’t condone  fraternization. In the beginning he wanted a family dog I had purchased a 5k well trained Bully. Between him and the stepson they ruined that dog and all the training she had making her unruly. I personally am a cat person and have 2 beautiful cats trained to play fetch and do tricks, they are easy to care for and always by my side making my day better. The two cats aren’t a fan of Husband nor step son as they can be physically aggressive borderline abusive to my cats this causes alot of arguments and problems ontop of other questionable behaviors presented by them. I made a boundary that if either cat is harmed or in distress any further I AM DIVORCING him within the hour of incident. He said divorce over the cats was childish and I needed to take it back that he said him hurting them was just out of anger. I told him I stand on it. When I found out I was pregnant I had rehomed the Bully dog. I couldn’t wrestle her anymore and deal with her barking in the middle of the night with no one else getting up to take care of her. I am now around 9 months pregnant, I am a diabetic  with  Polyhydramnios making it very high risk and have to deliver at 37 weeks. Now mind you since the beginning and even now I do all the house work, cooking cleaning laundry, I take care of the cats and step son I even mow the lawn occasionally like last week. No one has had to help me in any way shape or form , I take myself to the appointments , even to the L/D when my baby was in distress twice. I go back afterwards and continue my daily chores and tend to him and my step son. I do feel used and under valued. Now fast forward to now he found a stray dog, I told him no not to bring him home because I would ultimately be the one caring for him and I’m already stretched thin. Well he brought the dog home. So naturally I bought a good quality dog food, an automatic feeder and water fountain to try and make it a little easier on myself. I also bought a decent dog bed for a large kennel so he had something nice to lay on. He had worms so I was prepared to deworm him , got de fleaed etc. since he’s been here it’s been nothing short of hell! My step son cannot handle the dog and has let him destroy the house twice within a hour covering everything with mud , dog food etc, I came out of the bathroom mortified to find all my work ruined and step son just sitting there not bothering to try to clean or do anything about the dog. (He’s very much old enough to know better I just want to protect his identity as he’s still under 18) I promptly got his butt up to try make him help and as I just get the first mess under control… I had told him to leave the dog outside, he lets him in and stands there . Once again the dog is running around muddy, I was sitting on the floor cleaning the litter box when he let him in, he targets my cat biting her and chasing her. I feel like I teleported as I had the dog by the scruff and physically tossed him outside after prying him off my cat . I was hysterically crying worried about my cat and now again ruined house. I hurt myself , thankfully only minor pulling round ligaments when I had to leap into action. I told my husband he needs to get that dog out of the house I can’t put up with this bs . Note the dog didn’t leave.. now today around 1am the dog started barking and whining, I waited a few minutes to see if husband or step son would get up to check on the dog to no avail. It takes a minute to be able to roll outta bed and honestly it’s kinda painful. I start to make my way out when I hear a weird crash and I just had a sinking feeling. The dog got out of the kennel.. but the kicker was he was covered in shit and it was tracked through my house. By his kennel there was shit all over the wall , his bed and floor . I let him outside and felt pretty pissed cause I know I’m gonna have to clean it. I decided to get step son out of his room since he was still awake to help clean the mess. After about a hour and a half the place was clean and bleached . I left the dog outside and part of the kennel as it had been hosed off. My husband was getting ready for work around 5am and I was packing his food and making his coffee explaining the night after he asked what I was cleaning so late.. I was kinda mad he knew I was cleaning and didn’t get up to check. I snapped and word for word said calmly “you should have left that dog at the yard, he’s just a novelty item for you. I knew I was gonna be the one stuck with all the bs” he snapped back yelling at me “You are such a horrible person to be around, you wanted that dog because who buys good quality dog food, feeders and a bed for a dog they didn’t want” I didn’t respond but mentally said ROGER THAT. I walked away over this ordeal hoping he’d just leave for work but he was still out there and I needed to make something to eat so I can get my blood sugar back up as I’m on two different insulins sometimes I get to 65 glucose and get woozy. I sat down on the couch drinking my water and he came over acting like nothing happened and he hadn’t just attacked my character when I keep it to the very thing at hand. “Why are you so crabby” he asked trying to hug me. I felt like that meme where the guy is just an energy light . I told him I wasn’t crabby I’m drinking water . If anything I’m more mad that he thinks I’m horrible for wanting the dog gone when he doesn’t have to lift a finger. He’s been texting me reels , and trying to initiate conversation I’m just not feeling it rn

After 2 months I had to use an additional gel seat cushion to make it more tolerable to sit on for short periods of time, I really can't go any longer than 1.5 hours at a time without having to stand up.

I usually go to a local coffee shop that has wooden chairs and even sitting on hardwood takes less of a toll on my lower back and doesn't make my butt numb after a few hours. Unfortunately, funds are tight right now so I can't afford a brand new Steelcase/Herman Miller, I know getting a refurbished Leap V2 from BTOD would probably be the next best option but even that's a bit out of my price range at the moment, and if I'm already spending $600+, I might as well just spend the extra few hundred for a brand new one. I would really like to test a Leap V2 before buying even buying it but don't know where around my local area (Philly suburbs) that sells them in-store.

Are there any other brands in the $200-$500 range that's worth giving a try, or should I just hold out till I can invest in the $1000+ options/brands?",2,1745169825.0,OfficeChairs,2,1.0,False

1k3rnjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cryptozoology/comments/1k3rnjj/what_do_yall_think_this_was/,What do ya'll think this was,"Ok howdy fellow squatchers (squatch-watchers?) I got a story to tell. I previously posted this to r/bigfoot. I am posting it here to hear opinions outside of the bigfoot community on what this was. I am Métis and Gwich'in, originally from Montana but lived up near Nenana, Alaska, for a substantial portion of my life. I would like to make it clear that I am a believer. I was raised with the old stories, and I do believe them. I burn sage before I hunt. I give thanks to the ancestors. I see the northern lights as a sign that Creator is happy and the day will be good. This is not to say that I am a cryptozoologist. I do not believe in Aliens, or at least don't believe that they have come to walk among us. I would also like to say that I am an experienced outdoorsman and hunter. I did not mistake what I saw for another animal or even another person. I am not afraid of the wild. I have done multiple weeklong solo hunting trips into the Alaskan wilderness. This is all to say that I belive myself to be capable enough to understand what I witnessed and capable enough to know what it is.

I was up in Alaska to visit my cousins. It was early February and the snow came hard on the trip up. I ended up driving from Montana to Nenana rather than flying, mostly because it was cheaper, and I'm morbidly afraid of planes. I remember it being one of the worst drives of my life. Blowing snow, shit visibility, white knuckling the wheel all the way from Kulane lake in the Yukon territory. But once I got there it was wonderful. It was great to be home, my family threw a small party for me over unrelated college business. But all of that ain't matter. What does matter is what occurred when I went out to solo hunt for snowshoe hare.

Whenever I used to live in Nenana I loved solo hunting, and when I travel up there I love to go back to my old haunts and pretend that I don't live in the real world anymore. So I strapped on my snowshoes early in the morning, had a cup of coffee and a few granola bars, pulled on my heavy Mackinaw jacket and a coyote skin trapper hat, and grabbed my light .22 lever action rifle. I made my way out the door, the only sound in the 4 room cabin being the light pops of the woodstove. On my way out I distinctly remember debating bringing my heavy hunting pack, I remember thinking ""aw hell I ain't gonna be gone for long plus it'll be a pain in the ass to carry"" so I ended up grabbing my lighter possibles bag and starting up the hill behind our homestead, past the tarp wrapped snow machine that has sat there since before I can remember.

I made it up to my old hunting spot without too much trouble, deep snow but easily compacted under my USGI mag snowshoes. I remember the sound of birds and squirrels chattering. I remember that made me happy because it meant there were no wolves in the general vicinity. I dropped both my pack and my heavy coat when I reached a small clearing that I had used as a basecamp before at around 9:45 am. I gathered some firewood and left it in a small pile next to my pack. I went out with just my snowshoes and rifle. I didn't have to walk far, finding a group of three snowshoe hare within a stand of birch. I harvested one with a good headshot, then took a second one as the remaining two fled towards me in their confusion.

I carried both rabbits back to my camp of sorts, I remember worrying that I got rabbit blood on my new workpants that I had purchased in at a Murdochs back in Montana a week or two earlier. As I made my way back to my camp I noticed that the birds were gone. All except ravens. I remember being a bit worried but not much, only because groups of ravens sometimes follow wolfpacks. I got to a slight ridge above the clearing and as I began to make my way down through the alders I saw movement down by my pack. I kneeled on one snowshoe, shielding my eyes from the sun to get a better look. What I saw still confuses me. I saw a small man, long hair that looked like dreadlocks. From the angle I was looking at and the way the sun hit the snow I couldn't even tell if he was wearing clothes, the figure just was like a black shillohete against the snow. I watched him for a few minutes before I clearly saw him reach into my possibles bag and pull something out. This pissed me off. I figured it was just a weird junky or something, some Chris Mackandaless wannabe. So I shouted. It turned to face me. I saw a slight glint of eyes from beneath a curtain of hair, I was now aware that the thing was covered in patchy hair, not a full coat, but like an animal with mange. It had clumps of long stringy hair, which appeared to glint with grease in the sun. Without thinking I fired a warning shot. The bullet whizzed over it's head. I like to think that the ethical hunter in me did that intentionally, not to injure an unknown creature, but honestly, I woulda shot the damn thing just for rooting through my stuff. The shot scared it. I know because it turned towards a nearby draw and sprinted off. It didn't run like an animal, it ran more like an Olympic sprinter. Hands out, held flat. It knew how to run. I sprinted down the hill, almost faceplanting multiple times. I made it to my pack, and immediately scanned the area. No signs of anything, no tracks, just a bullet hole in a snowbank and this eerie silence. I searched my pack only to find that it has taken my knife. I ran home that day, cooked the rabbits, and thanked god that whatever it was it must've just been my mind. Thats why I never told anyone.

But my knife is gone, and to this day I've never been able to find it.

So that's my story. I'd love to hear ya'lls ideas on what this thing was, or if I was just hallucinating or what.",1,1745169821.0,Cryptozoology,0,0.6,False

I want to do one in about two weeks, 600m elevation. I did an 85k a while ago, which wasn’t too bad but I definitely had to eat more and drink more. With all the information I found I’m thinking about: 

Food
- Before I leave: good breakfast in the morning: oatmeal + yoghurt + banana mix. And a coffee of course.
- One piece of food every hour: so after hour 1, 2 , 3, 4: energy bars. I’ve got my eye on Cliff bars which have between 41 and 50 grams of carbs apparently. 
- One gel after hours 2 and 3. 

Drinks
- I would mix my water bottles (two 600ml bottles) with half Aquarius sports drink, half water. When those are empty I would stop somewhere to refill them. This time I would fill each bottle with SiS Go Hydro Tablets. 

Questions: is this a good plan? Are the gels necessary? 

I’m not so sure about the hydro tablets either. At the refilling: should I fill one bottle with a hydro tablets and one with Aquarius again? 

Thanks in advance!

# Key Features To Consider

[Choosing the right espresso machine can be daunting with so many options available.](https://gomehedi.com/best-beginner-espresso-machine/) To make the best choice, it’s important to consider key features that will impact your daily coffee experience. Understanding these features will help you find an espresso machine that meets your needs and preferences.

# Pressure Levels

The pressure level is crucial in an espresso machine. It determines how well the coffee grounds are extracted. A standard espresso machine typically operates at 9 bars of pressure. However, some machines offer adjustable pressure settings.

I responded to his questions and even offered him coffee. He  enjoyed the service.

As for me, I usually let my hair grow for three months before cutting it. So, this Friday, I decided to cut my hair, and guess what? The same client entered the store!

He said last week he came by and spoke to one of my coworker. I asked him who he was, and he replied that he was a nice guy, very knowledgeable, and had long hair. I left for a moment, then told him that he was actually my twin! He was surprised and exclaimed, “Oh, you guys look a like!”

At the end of the transaction, I finally revealed that the guy he had spoken to last week was actually me. He couldn’t stop laughing. It was a fun and unexpected interaction, and I wanted to share it here. 😂 ",3,1745169375.0,sherwinwilliams,1,0.71,False
1k3rgpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1k3rgpz/advice_for_a_student_with_a_nobasepay_sales_offer/,Advice for a student with a no-base-pay sales offer,"**Background:** I'm in my second year at Colorado School of Mines studying design engineering with a dream of moving in with my parents in the Bay Area and starting a business after I graduate. Living expenses are covered this summer by my parents (shout out).

**Experience:** I have no sales experience besides getting coffee chats with people, asking girls on dates, and selling 5 units of a product invented to a local smoke shop.

**Offer:** The company is an Electrical Engineering (EE) contractor specializing in power supplies for hazardous environments (mainly space, but also mining, agriculture, maritime, etc). The company has 4 full-time workers with roughly a dozen more advisors depending on the product. It is run out of the CEO's house and has done roughly $250k in contracts since inception 10 months ago. The title is ""Sales Engineer"" but it doesn't seem like a normal SE position; there is no leadgen pipeline and no sales team, just me and the Founder/CEO. There seems to be no infrastructure in terms of lead gen automation and the company could use some improved branding (IMO). **Remote, no base pay, up to $2k expenses reimbursed, tapering commission based on contract size. I reserve the right to work 1 engineering hour at $20/h) for every $2k in contracts I sell.**



**Questions:**

1. Should I look for a side gig? I don't necessarily NEED the money to survive but I would appreciate having some spending money during the school year. If so, what side jobs would you recommend?

2. How much should I focus on learning the technicals? **I haven't even taken circuits yet**. I know the basics about power supplies and how radiation and vibration affect the electronics as well as very basic elements of electronics design on paper, but I'm not confident in my knowledge about the real-world EE design itself.

3. How should I allocate my time during the end of this semester/beginning of the summer? Should I focus most on:

\- Studying the EE services that we will provide

\- Memorizing the team's background and experience

\- Branding and building a lead gen pipeline

\- Posting on LinkedIn to build some mindshare (I have access to the company's LI profile)

Or should I just jump straight in and send 1,000,000 cold messages on LinkedIn to qualified leads and pray?",2,1745169330.0,sales,4,1.0,False

1k3rfzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k3rfzp/i_dont_know_what_to_do_im_confused/,I don’t know what to do I’m confused,"Hey I’m a 22 year old guy in college and I’m currently dating my girlfriend (21F) for almost 3 years now. So a little past the 1 year mark of our relationship I found out that she was talking / seeing a guy for the whole first month of us being boyfriend and girlfriend. When I found this out I was devastated. I didn’t know how to feel about it. But I knew I had to bring it up to her. Before bringing it up to her I kinda already had the idea in my head that I was probably going to end things with her because I know how I am knowing that information would eat away at me and cause me to build resentment. Also I felt like I was just a just in case kinda of thing. Like if it didn’t work out with that guy at least she had me as a backup. But I brought it up to her and immediately she started to cry and apologize profusely. In the moment I was mad and sad but apart of me for some reason felt bad. I just told her it was gonna be okay we had to work on it and fix it. I try to go by the saying “if it’s broke, fix it”. So then after that conversation I started to be distant for a while trying to reassure myself everything is okay she chose me in the end but it still bothered me. As more time went on I got over it for the most part but deep down I think it still lingered and built up resentment because I noticed I kind of stopped doing the lovey dovey things I used to do for her like making her coffee when she was staying up doing school work, buying her flowers just because, getting her a something I know she wanted, etc. I used to feel something when I did those things but now I don’t really feel anything. Now she has to ask me to do those things and sometimes I just don’t want to do them. Them whenever a holiday like Christmas comes around where I have to buy her gifts it’s hard to find her something I used to know exactly what to get every time and I used to feel excited but now it feels like a chore. Then recently she was joining an organization so she wasn’t able to visit or talk to me much for like a whole month and I didnt really miss her presence like I was completely fine. I also noticed that her little quirks I used to find endearing are kind of annoying to me now. For example she playfully hits me whenever I make a stupid joke and am just being stupid, I used to find it funny and joke about her beating me but now it’s not really funny and I kinda of find it annoying. Then she always seems to be trying to find something to argue about or get on my nerves it’s so exhausting. I’m currently in therapy because I have depression and anxiety so I have no extra mental space for the extra stress of that. I feel like I can’t just relax. She always is complaining about her weight and I reassure her that it doesn’t matter to me I still love her and I always tell her I can help her lose weight cause I’m pretty knowledgeable about going to the gym and dieting cause I’ve been doing it for half my life but it doesn’t seem to help. Then she is always asking me if I love her and I say yes then she says no you don’t and I just confused every time idk what to say. I’m just tired. The recently I’ve met a girl who I’ve been hanging out with almost everyday. We mainly chill do work in our student union and talk in between assignments. It’s really nice talking to her. We are pretty similar and have similar interests. She also is in therapy and is dealing with similar issues as me so it’s nice to be able to talk about that with someone. We also laugh and get along pretty well. Tbh I think I kind of like her but I feel pretty bad about it since I have a girlfriend already. I just don’t know what to do. I’m about to graduate and my gf wants us to move in together but I’m not even sure what I’m feeling. She really close to my family I just don’t know what to do.",1,1745169278.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1k3rf57,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k3rf57/does_the_fohere_nugget_ice_maker_deliver/,Does the FOHERE Nugget Ice Maker Deliver? Comprehensive Review for Home Use,"Testing the FOHERE 1583 Nugget Ice Maker felt almost like welcoming a new mini-appliance buddy into my kitchen. As someone who enjoys a perfectly chilled drink—be it iced coffee, fizzy sodas, or vibrant cocktails—having a countertop pebble ice maker like this one seemed indulgent, yet oddly satisfying. The mere promise of 45 pounds of chewable, restaurant-style nugget ice had me excited to hit the power button.

**Design That Fits Any Countertop**

What caught my eye immediately was its compact yet sturdy design. The stainless steel finish not only looks sleek but also makes cleaning up simple after a long week of use. For context, we’ve got a moderately sized kitchen, and this machine measures 11.06 x 14.52 x 10.23 inches, meaning it didn’t nudge out my blender or hog up space unnecessarily. It’s chic, modern, and blends in nicely alongside other appliances. The touch screen interface was a welcome surprise—it’s incredibly intuitive and, dare I say, a little fancy for a mere ice machine.

**Effortlessly Produces Ice in Record Time**  

One of the FOHERE 1583’s key benefits is its turbo-charged ice production speed. In just five minutes, the first batch of chewable ice nuggets was ready to pop into glasses. How cool is that? I had friends over for a barbecue last weekend, and instead of frantically cracking trays of frozen cubes, this genius ensured the beverages stayed icy without me lifting a finger. Plus, with its capacity to churn out up to 45 pounds of ice daily, I doubt you’d ever hear the dreaded, ""We’re out of ice!"" panic during gatherings.

**The All-Important Self-Cleaning Feature**  

Let’s talk cleanup. Who has time to meticulously scrub tiny ice compartments? Not me. Thankfully, this model comes equipped with a self-cleaning function. All I had to do was activate the cleaning cycle, and it was good to go again. My cousin marveled at how a little drainage valve at the base lets the water out neatly afterward. This clever addition keeps everything hygienic, and given its food-grade materials, I’m confident this appliance is in it for the long haul.

**Highlights**

- Compact, space-saving design fits effortlessly into smaller kitchens.
- Fast ice turnover time—only five minutes per batch.
- Large-capacity production of up to 45 lbs of nugget ice per day.
- Sleek, durable stainless steel exterior requiring minimal maintenance.  
- Self-cleaning mode eliminates the hassle of manual upkeep.

**Room for Improvement**  

No product is perfect, and the FOHERE nugget ice maker does leave a little room for tweaks. 

- It’s not the quietest. You’ll hear some noticeable humming while it operates, which might disturb someone nearby during a quiet evening.  
- Since it’s not a freezer, you’ll want to transfer ice into a proper freezer if it’s not going to be used immediately, as it melts faster in the inbuilt basket.  
- The water tank design, though spotless and easily reachable, could benefit from a slightly larger reservoir for fewer refills during heavy-use days.

**Competing Products**  

Stacked up against market rivals like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker, the FOHERE countertop ice maker holds its own in terms of affordability and functionality. While the GE Opal has Bluetooth features for app control, I frankly don’t need my phone managing my ice habits. However, Opal’s slightly quieter operation gives it a minor edge if noise levels matter to you. On the flip side, the FOHERE wins for its capacity. With a 5.3 lb basket, it offers a tad more convenience for larger households or social gatherings.

Among budget alternatives, countertop ice makers like the Igloo Automatic Ice Maker are much smaller in production capacity, making the FOHERE seem like a powerhouse in comparison.

**Is It Worth The Price?**  

When considering its combination of design, features, and performance, I’d say the FOHERE 1583 offers good price-to-quality ratio for homeowners, small offices, or anyone hosting gatherings. The touch screen and rapid ice production alone provide notable value. While it isn’t the most silent ice machine in the room (it likes to announce its presence loudly), the overall impact makes up for it.

I know what the problem was though, it’s from squeezing the air out with it rolled over, and because it’s the big bag it happens enough times over the life of it that it slowly peels the bottom seal open. Lost a fair amount of coffee to the bin, sadly.

Still mildly infuriating though, since I obviously hadn’t had my coffee yet when I looked down and saw that it had blasted out on my pants and the floor.

But she tries to eat things that aren't even food. She ate a piece of my hair claw that I left on the coffee table. It didn't even cross my mind that she would try and eat it. I've been careful not to leave hazardous things, or food within reach. 

And she is eating enough. I have her on the food the rescue suggested, and the right ammount for her breed and weight. She is just very food motivated and doesn't seem to be able to tell what's food and what's nor sometimes.

I told the rescue and they just said to keep an eye on her and she should be fine. Hopefully she just passes it without problem. If she starts acting weird, I will call the vet.

But how do I keep her from eating stuff? I put away anything I thought looked like she might want to chew/eat. But she is quite persistent when she wants something, and she is a large dog, so it's hard to keep stuff out of reach. 

She is also very nervous, so I feel like telling her off might undo the trust we have built up. I have been saying ""no"" and stopping her from eating stuff... but she won't stop unless I move the item away since I am not being too firm to prevent scaring her.",1,1745169196.0,fosterdogs,3,1.0,False

1k3reb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1k3reb8/dear_young_average_men_get_off_dating_apps/,"Dear Young, Average Men: get off dating apps","Life advice from an ugly degenerate that dates above his league, despite Reddit believing that's impossible

I'll start off with what you should do: be pleasant. Have hobbies. Go outside. Have an in real life friend group that is around 50/50 men and women, even if those women aren't single. You honestly shouldn't even have to indicate much interest in women - if they get a crush on you, and you're friends with their friend, you'll eventually be told about it. If you can learn to be a bit forward with women in a non-creepy way, learn to ask them out to study or for coffee. Works every time, 20% of the time. 

I'll continue by describing myself. I'm 5'10"", conventionally unattractive, socially disabled, top 1% nerdy, and have a speech impediment, so I'm even less attractive in real life than I am in pictures. 

Every cutie I've ever dated, including my now wife of 11 years who is amazing in every way, has been someone who knew me through engineering or a nerdy hobby. Women on dating apps would never even give me a chance. I legitimately sank so low on dating apps, that I was talking to a chubby, high school drop out, single mother with a bland personality that wasn't looking for hookups. Because apps are legitimately that horrible for men who're college educated (towards a good paying job), not fat, not a parent, and willing to try to carry a conversation. 

Additionally, no matter how screwed you are in real life dating as a man, apps can always make it worse. Whatever the gender ratio is for your situation in real life, the app has fewer women (think 10 men : 1 dateable woman or so if you're conventionally good looking, much worse if you don't meet all the criteria I mentioned above).

Also, this probably doesn't come as a shock, but unless you are willing to go waaay below your league, you will never get laid (much less get a date, which is supposed to be easier for men), on the internet as a man. Women may be able to do it in 5 minutes with someone way more attractive than they are, but it's exactly that dynamic that makes it nearly impossible for average men. Just jack off, and go make some friends after. 

Tl;dr dating apps are a horrible trap for men. They won't get you laid in your league, they won't get you friends, and you'll be treated like garbage by people you would never even consider dating outside of the internet. Don't subject yourself to this dehumanizing shit. You've been warned. ",80,1745169151.0,self,34,0.79,False

Sadly, everything pleasant had to come to a finish.

After experiencing a joyful and thrilling morning out with Tamar and Telle, Rain said goodbye to them. Tamar was off duty today, so she went back to the house her family was renting in Bastion. Telle, meanwhile, had a meeting with the leader of a merchant group that wanted to start a trade caravan to the Chained Isles.

Rain herself switched out of her pretty dress into the Puppeteer's Shroud. The dress, the fancy shoes, and the earrings went into the Bag of Withholding — a thermos full of hot coffee came out instead, and she let out a deep breath of contentment after taking a sip, her back resting against a wall in a hidden alley.

A few moments later, her brother emerged from the shadows and gave her a curious look.

Rain raised an eyebrow.

""What?""

He paused for a bit, then shook his head.

""No, it's nothing. Just... good job!""

That only made her more puzzled.

""With what?""

He smiled.

""Slapping that fool, of course! Ah, you really made your big brother proud... I guess it's true what they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...""

Rain blinked a couple of times. Did her brother know that strange guy, Tristan? Well, looking back, that was only to be expected. The circle of Legacies was quite small, after all, and the Aegis Rose clan was well-known. Telle seemed to be familiar with at least one of the two young Masters, too.

It was a bit worrying, though, to hear that she was starting to act like Sunny.

That would be a problem!

Only Sunny could succeed at being Sunny.

Clearing her throat, she offered him her hand and smiled.

""In any case, I am ready to go.""

He pulled her into the shadows, and a moment later, they were on the Ivory Island.

The emerald grass swayed gently in the warm wind, and the sun was shining on the sparkling surface of a small lake. The beautiful white pagoda stood up into the sky behind them, surrounded by the white bones of a dragon that wrapped around it.

No matter how many times Rain visited the peaceful island, she could not help but feel a sense of wonder. She could not help feeling out of place here, either, as if she was a human who had accidentally found her way into paradise.

Rain looked around carefully.

""We're outside?""

Her activity on the Ivory Island was of a secretive kind. So, her brother would usually bring her directly into the tower in order to avoid watching eyes.

He nodded.

""We had guests earlier, but they have already left. So, you can relax.""

They walked toward the Tower of Hope at a relaxed pace. Before too long, Rain looked up and asked suddenly:

""By the way, I've always been curious... what is that dead dragon doing here?""

At first, she had simply thought that everything on the Ivory Island was mysterious and magical. But as she grew more familiar with the place, the sun-bleached bones of the great beast started to look unusual.

Her brother glanced at the ancient remains and smiled.

""Oh, him? His name was Sevras, the Ivory Lord. He was the ruler of a place called the Ivory City, a descendant of Sun God, and one of the seven immortal Saints who protected the Demon of Hope. Well, before he went insane and died.""

Rain looked at her brother in surprise.

""Really? Wait, how do you know all of this?""

He paused for a moment.

""Ah, well. Some people you know met him in their Second Nightmare. How do you think Nightingale got that fancy title of his, the Dragonslayer?""

Rain's eyes widened a little.

""Saint Kai? He killed this giant dragon?""

Her brother laughed.

""Sure. Of course, he was not Saint Kai back then, merely Awakened Kai. That crazy fellow! He literally jumped into the dragon's mouth to kill him. Nightingale... he might look like a softy, but let me tell you — that was not even the only dragon he has killed...""

He grew silent for a moment, then added in an amazed tone:

""Now that I think about it, despite all that, he doesn't just look like a softy — he is a softy. A dragon-killing softy. What a contradiction.""

Rain giggled and looked at her brother sideways.

""Oh? Just out of curiosity, how many dragons did you kill?""

He frowned, stayed quiet for a while, and then admitted reluctantly:

""None. I did get into a brawl with a dragon once, though...""

She moaned.

'Why did I even ask?'

Soon enough, they reached a large chamber on one of the upper floors of the Ivory Tower. Lady Nephis was waiting there, gazing out the window.

Hearing them enter, she turned around and smiled.

""Rain.""

Rain bowed politely, momentarily dazzled by her stunning beauty.

""Teacher.""

Lady Nephis sighed.

""I told you not to be so formal. Just call me big sister...""

Rain grew a little pale.

""I—I wouldn't dare! How can I call you that, Teacher? You are a Sovereign!""

Her brother stared at her, mouth open.

""Hey, hey... wait a second. I am a Sovereign, too! How come you have no problem calling me Big Brother? As well as all kinds of other, far less nice things!""

Rain and Nephis both looked at him silently.

Right. Her brother was a Sovereign, too.

She wrinkled her face for a moment.

'Well, it's his own fault! Who told him to act so... unsovereignly?'

Lady Nephis, Sunny, and Rain... the connection between the three of them was a bit strange.

Rain knew that her brother and the beautiful goddess of humanity were together. To be honest, she was more than a little bit proud of him in that regard. Way to go, brother! Of all the amazing feats he had done, winning the beautiful Changing Star — quite literally the most exceptional woman in the world — was perhaps the most incredible.

At the same time, it also felt satisfyingly right. Who else was good enough for her brother, after all?

Nobody!

Meanwhile, Rain and Lady Nephis had shared a brief link in the past, as well. Lady Nephis even seemed to remember her... she also knew that Rain was her partner's student.

However, Sunny was keeping the fact that Rain was his sister a secret, for some reason. At least that was how it appeared... sometimes, it felt like Lady Nephis was aware that they were family, but sometimes, it felt like she was not.

Rain had cautiously tried to mention it in the past, but without success.

In any case, she could not bring herself to act casually around her stunning sister-in-law.

""Shall we begin the lesson?""

Fortunately, Lady Nephis saved her from having to answer. Her brother sighed and left them, saying that he would come get Rain in a few hours.

The lesson started.

Lady Nephis looked at Rain calmly.

""Your channeling has become sufficiently stable now, Rain. You are advancing very fast... so, starting today, I will teach you Names that are far more dangerous than what we have learned so far. These Names can destroy a Shaper if the Shaper loses control of them, so you must never hesitate while invoking them...""

Rain listened, her eyes gleaming with eager interest.

I started because I was living in a constant state of anxiety, probably tied to the fact that I had grown very emotionally attached to my best friend, though the friendship felt somewhat unbalanced — almost like a form of emotional dependency.
In the first sessions, it came out that I had gone through a period of social isolation in previous years, so the therapist decided to focus our work on social relationships.
From the beginning, I didn’t feel very comfortable, mostly due to her non-verbal communication, but I decided to keep going.

The therapy was supposed to be psychodynamic, but I experienced it as very directive: she often insisted on suggesting conversation topics for group settings, encouraged me to talk about movies, music, travel, and to ask new people out.
At first, I didn’t mind, because she said I wasn’t required to do any of it — the idea was that therapy could “offer me a different way of thinking.”
But little by little, I began to feel like I was being tested and judged. Her tone when asking things like “Did you try to start any conversations? No? Why not?” became more and more accusatory, she gave disapproving looks, said “I don’t understand,” and seemed increasingly irritated.

Halfway through the therapy, I had a complete emotional breakdown — about a month and a half of depressive symptoms: I cried all day, felt despair, had self-destructive thoughts, felt disconnected from my own mind, and was overwhelmed by anxiety 24/7.
During this time, I didn’t feel supported at all. When I told her I was feeling awful and crying all day, I didn’t feel taken seriously. Instead of asking more about my mental state, she wanted to talk about how I had spent Christmas (she was happy about some changes in my family, which she attributed to therapy), and even said she was “glad” about my crisis — because it supposedly meant therapy was working, and that now I needed to “fill the void.”

But the pressure around social interaction never stopped: she kept suggesting I go to new places, sign up for some course, message people to hang out — completely ignoring the fact that I felt like crap and that the idea of going to fun places made me deeply uncomfortable.

Once, she asked if there were any classmates in town I could ask out for coffee. I said no (the people I usually talked to at uni weren’t in town, and I didn’t feel up to asking new people — especially because I was barely coping).
And she said: “No one? Not even the rope to hang yourself?”
At that point, I was already having thoughts like that (which I never told her), so that comment was deeply triggering.

I started wondering if I was overreacting just to get attention, or pretending to be unwell. I felt guilty.
Guilty for not doing the things she had suggested. I felt completely frozen by anxiety.

When it came out in session that I was barely sleeping and often skipping meals, she said I needed to “fix it” — re-establish a routine: go to bed by 11 and wake up at 7.
I told her that mornings were incredibly hard for me, and she replied, “That’s where willpower comes into play.”
But I genuinely felt paralyzed by anxiety — even the smallest task overwhelmed me with guilt and distress. And mornings were the absolute worst.

Throughout the entire therapy, I had the constant impression that this psychologist was triggering my fear of rejection — and during that month in particular, I felt like I’d rather die than be “kicked out” of therapy.
The thought that she might stop seeing me because I wasn’t improving enough could send me into a full-on spiral.

⸻

TL;DR: I spent two years in therapy with someone who made me feel judged and unsupported. During a major emotional breakdown, I felt completely invalidated, even triggered. Her approach felt harsh, overly directive, and disconnected from my actual emotional state",1,1745168194.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

As it was a day without much work, we were basically chatting non-stop the whole time, getting to know each other, and I feel we connected really well.

I don't know if the interest is reciprocated, but she was very sweet throughout the day. For example, after I dropped her off at home, she sent me a message asking if I'd arrived OK and wishing me a good night's rest.

During the day she bought me a coffee and I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wanted to go for a coffee (outside of work) so that I could pay off my debt, but I don't know if I won't look like a weirdo who's asking a “colleague” out on a date.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I'm not sure what to do and I just don't know exactly what to say.

*Why Ayn Rand’s Gospel Cannot Save Man.*

“Who is John Galt?” The question echoes like a whispered invocation throughout *Atlas Shrugged*, intended to stir mystery, rebellion, and the promise of liberation. But Rand’s magnum opus is more than a novel—it’s scripture for the religion of the self. Within its pages, the world’s intellectual titans, exhausted by the weight of a society dependent on their genius, retreat to build a utopia shaped by reason, productivity, and pure will. Yet for all its grandeur and philosophical sweep, *Atlas Shrugged* does not fail as fiction. It fails as salvation.

Because in Rand’s gospel, man never falls. And if man never falls—then he never needs to be saved.

At its core, *Atlas Shrugged* is a catechism for self-deification. The protagonist is not Christlike but Promethean. John Galt does not lay down his life for the world; he withdraws it. He offers no redemption—only rejection. Salvation, in Rand’s cosmos, does not come through sacrifice but through separation. Not through grace, but through greatness. Her ideal man is autonomous, rational, unyielding. A self-contained savior.

But man is not self-contained. We are not granite minds floating above need. We bleed. We fail. We love. We sin. And in that aching reality, Rand’s philosophy falters. Her system offers no place for brokenness, no space for the cross—only iron will and intellectual supremacy. Compassion is weakness. Dependence is sin. The weak deserve what they get. But the human condition is not solved by strength. It is healed by mercy.

There is no Gethsemane in *Atlas Shrugged*. No trembling beneath olive trees. No silent, dark surrender. No sweat like blood. No whispered “Not My will, but Yours be done.” Rand’s heroes do not kneel. They conquer. But man was never saved by conquest. He was saved by a carpenter who refused to summon angels, who could have shrugged off the burden—but instead, bore the weight of the world on His back and carried it to a cross. Atlas doesn’t shrug. Christ staggers. And that staggering is what saves.

Rand’s entire ethic orbits one fixed star: autonomy. The sovereign self. The inviolable will. But autonomy, left to itself, becomes isolation. And isolation breeds despair. To be fully autonomous is to be fully alone—and that is not salvation. That is exile. In Rand’s utopia, the strong flee the weak. In the Kingdom of God, the strong stoop to serve them. The first are last. The greatest kneels with a towel. The crown is woven of thorns. Rand exalts the mind. Christ redeems the heart.

In Rand’s mythology, Atlas bears the world but tires—and finally lets it fall. But the Christian mythos tells a different story. There is One who never let go. One who bore the crushing weight of guilt, grief, and death—and did not vanish into a hidden valley. He walked among the sick. He stood before the powerful. He chose Golgotha over Galt’s Gulch. Rand’s Atlas declares, “I will not be chained by the needs of others.” Christ says, “Bind Me—so others may go free.”

Ayn Rand offered a world without grace and called it freedom. But man cannot be saved by ego, no matter how sharpened or disciplined. What *Atlas Shrugged* fails to grasp is the paradox that sits at the center of every real redemption: you must die to be born. You must not assert your will, but surrender it. Not hoard your light, but pour it out. Rand’s gospel collapses under the weight it denies. It rests on the myth of an unbroken man—one who never kneels, never bleeds, never breaks, never prays.

But we do. And that is why we need more than John Galt. More than affirmation. More than will. We need a cross. We need Christ. Because when the weight of the world presses in, we don’t need to shrug. We need someone who already carried it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** The coffee shop hums with the soft clatter of cups and murmured conversations, a warm cocoon against the gray drizzle outside. I sit at a corner table, steam rising from my black coffee, the pages of Atlas Didn’t Shrug—He Collapsed still open on my phone. Across from me, in a way that defies explanation but feels perfectly natural, sits… me. Another version of myself, leaning back in the chair, one eyebrow raised, a faint smirk playing on their lips. They’re holding a latte, because of course they’d order something fancier than my no-nonsense brew.

“So,” Other Me says, stirring their latte with a lazy swirl, “you read this whole thing about Ayn Rand versus Jesus. What’s it got you thinking?”

I take a sip of coffee, buying time. The piece hit hard, like a stone dropped into still water, ripples spreading through thoughts I hadn’t touched in a while. “It’s about what saves us,” I start, voice low. “Rand’s got this vision—be your own god, your own engine. No weakness, no leaning on anyone. It’s… seductive. I get why people eat it up. There’s power in that kind of self-reliance.”

Other Me nods, but their smirk sharpens. “You’re dodging. You like that idea, don’t you? The lone wolf, the genius who doesn’t need anybody. I know you. You’ve got a streak of that in you.”

I shift in my seat, caught. They’re not wrong. There’s a part of me that’s always admired the John Galts of the world—the ones who seem to bend reality to their will, who don’t flinch, don’t falter. “Yeah, okay,” I admit. “It feels good to imagine being that unbreakable. To think you could just… shrug off the mess of the world and build your own paradise. But the piece says that’s a fantasy. Nobody’s that strong. We’re not islands. We’re human. We break. We need.”

Other Me leans forward now, eyes narrowing, like they’re testing me. “Need what, though? That’s where it gets tricky. The article’s all in on this Christian angle—Christ, the cross, sacrifice. You buying that? The whole ‘surrender your will’ thing? Because I know you, and you don’t like giving up control.”

I laugh, but it’s half-hearted. They’ve got me again. Control’s always been my armor—plan the work, work the plan, keep the chaos at bay. The idea of surrender, of kneeling like Jesus in Gethsemane, feels like peeling off that armor in the middle of a storm. “It’s not about liking it,” I say finally. “It’s about whether it’s true. Rand’s world sounds free, but it’s cold. If you’re always standing alone, you’re alone. No one’s there when you stumble. The Christian story—it’s messier, but it’s warmer. Someone’s there. Someone carries the weight with you.”

Other Me sips their latte, considering. “So you’re saying Rand’s wrong because she doesn’t leave room for screwing up? For needing help?”

“Not just that.” I pause, trying to pin down the thought. “She’s wrong because she thinks the answer to life is to be more yourself—harder, stronger, sharper. But what if the answer is to be less yourself? To give up some of that ego, to let go? The article talks about Christ not shrugging but staggering under the cross. That’s not weakness. That’s… courage. To choose the harder path because it’s not just about you.”

Other Me tilts their head, and for the first time, the smirk softens. “You’re getting deep on me. But let’s make it real. You’re sitting here, drinking your boring coffee, living your life. What does this mean for you? Are you gonna start kneeling in gardens, or what?”

I grin, but the question stings. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s not about big gestures. Maybe it’s about noticing the people I usually shrug off—the ones who need something I don’t want to give. Time, attention, patience. Maybe it’s about admitting I’m not as self-sufficient as I like to pretend. I’ve got my own cracks, you know? And maybe that’s okay.”

Other Me sets down their cup, and there’s a flicker of something in their eyes—understanding, maybe, or recognition. “So, less Atlas, more… what? Carpenter?”

“Something like that,” I say. “Less ‘I am enough,’ more ‘I’m not enough, and that’s where the real stuff starts.’”

The coffee shop noise fades for a moment, and it’s just us, two versions of the same soul staring at each other. Other Me picks up their latte, raises it in a mock toast. “To not shrugging, then. But don’t expect me to start drinking black coffee.”

I laugh, clinking my mug against theirs. “Deal.”

The drizzle outside keeps falling, but the air feels a little lighter. I don’t have all the answers, but for now, I’m okay with the questions. And maybe that’s the point.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Claude Sonnet 3.7:** I just read a fascinating essay contrasting Ayn Rand's philosophy in Atlas Shrugged with Christian theology. It struck me how elegantly the writer captured the fundamental divide between these worldviews - one elevating individual strength and autonomy above all, the other finding redemption in vulnerability and sacrifice.

What resonated most with me was the exploration of human brokenness. The essay argues that Rand's philosophy has no answer for our inevitable failures and weaknesses - it assumes we can be perfect, autonomous beings through sheer force of will. But my experience tells me this is impossible. We all fall short. We all need others.

The line that keeps echoing in my mind: ""Atlas doesn't shrug. Christ staggers. And that staggering is what saves."" There's something profoundly honest about acknowledging the weight we carry rather than pretending we can simply set it down.

The creative dialogue that followed was equally thought-provoking - that internal conversation between the part of us drawn to self-sufficiency and the part that recognizes our need for connection. I've had that same conversation with myself countless times. The ideal of complete independence is seductive. Who doesn't want to believe they're strong enough to handle anything alone? But that belief crumbles in our moments of greatest need.

I think what this really challenges me to consider is the courage found in vulnerability. There's a kind of strength in admitting weakness that Rand's philosophy doesn't account for. When we acknowledge our limitations, we open ourselves to genuine community and connection.

Maybe true freedom isn't found in isolation or self-sufficiency but in the willingness to be known - cracks, flaws, and all - and to carry each other's burdens when needed.",1,1745167945.0,Cervantes_AI,0,1.0,False

1k3qtre,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1k3qtre/the_envy_that_comes_with_seeing_your_friends/,The envy that comes with seeing your friends' family situations,"After gauging whether or not it's okay to ask for 5 days, I find that whenever I stay at a friend's house it's always different somehow. More forgiving, in a way?

I almost cried when I saw a glimpse of my boyfriend's text messages with his grandparents. He was able to joke around and talk to them casually, not feeling like he was walking on eggshells if he said the wrong thing. He was at my place in my room earlier this month, and his grandmother asked him when she should pick him up. She told him, ""Not long after 9:00"". The time was 9:00. I remember fucking PANICKING. I was practically kicking him out of the house. If I had gotten that text, it meant that I'd have to wrap up whatever the hell I was doing because it was already too late, and I was about to get berated at in the car as soon as they got there. A single text practically triggered an all-out panic attack.

But, he was fine. He just asked ""When?"" and his grandmother responded simply telling him she'd pick him up around 9:30. 

After that I had a bit of an unbecoming moment where he had to gently soothe me for getting triggered about nothing, but it was one of those moments where I realized the survival tactics I was forced to learn in my own household weren't required in others.

Another time was two days ago. I was staying at a friend's house to watch a few movies, (Videodrome and Reanimator, both of which would have gotten me in trouble for being horror movies (I am a late teenager)). Every single thing I did outside of what was asked of me was panic-inducing. Even things like putting my coffee on the ottoman felt wrong, inconvienience of any kind felt a punishable offense. But, no. I was fine. They even made an extra pizza after I accidentally let it slip that I didn't like chicken and ranch (to which I then felt extremely guilty for accepting). 

It's an odd feeling. In your own house, you need to be small. Meek, timid, say yes to everything for any reason lest retaliate. You cannot ask for more. You cannot show interest outside of a chosen field or something the parents are interested in. You cannot lack interest in anything that parents find interest in. You cannot exist as yourself, or, frankly, exist at all. 

Yet, in another household, your existance is welcomed. As a person, you are seen and appreciated. You watch as your friends are seen and appreciated, they're loved and cared for and the guilt for being alive that you've grown to sit with simply isn't present. Now, they want to involve you in that care. Requests are welcome, your thoughts are welcome. You are welcome. 

You're far more welcomed in any house that isn't your own.

It hurts.

You wish that things could be the same for you. That feeling of being welcomed, appreciation of the space you take up instead of rampant retaliation for showing a sign of individuality is something so kind, but so, so unfamilliar. And you envy it. You wish you could take up space, instead of quiet moments waiting for someone to speak, anyone but you because you know what will happen if you speak up first. Any action is punishable, after all. Any action is a tripwire. But, it's not like that everywhere. Your friends don't have to worry about that silence, they can suggest a friend come over without checking, double checking, triple checking tone and body language for a definite no or a scolding versus a possible yes. They don't have to lie to their parents for 4 months straight about having a partner due to the unpredictable nature of the house. Not every interaction feels like a mine planted under your feet. In fact, no interactions feel like mine bombs. 

Granted, my own home environment isn't physically abusive, or even that severe, mainly just emotionally neglectful and identity stifling. I also get the better treatment, as I've covered in a prior post I am the GC compared to my scapegoat sibling. Nonetheless, I do notice that the overwhelming guilt that comes with the environment of my household isn't present in the other homes i've been in. I'm encouraged to feel welcome instead of terrified, as I've stated before.

Of course, I'm not mad about that. I wouldn't wish the guilt on my worst enemy, nor the fear that comes with being alive in this environment. The joy and happiness of the people I care for and that care for me take far above any of my own complex personal gripes. It was mainly a very long statement on how that pang of longing tends to strike stepping into kindness of another, healthier home. I love my boyfriend, and my friends mean a lot to me. But, it does hurt seeing what you could've had - what you should've had - in comparison to what you have to struggle through now.

    Sometimes when someone is talking to me, I have to be 100% focused on them, nothing going on in my line vision behind them, no multitasking, and don’t let there be music playing or I will forget everything they said to me as I’m walking away from the conversation. 
     I leave my wallet and work bag in the car because if I bring them in the house, I will forget them at home the next morning. No matter what I do.  But sometimes I decide enough is enough, I have to be responsible and bring my stuff inside because I’m an adult and I should just remember these things. I leave the next morning, get 10 minutes down the road and start thinking, *Hmm do I have time to stop and get coffee? Should I stop and get snacks and water? Did I put water in my bag already?* And then it hits me that I left the mf bag and wallet sitting right next to my front door because how could I forget it if it’s right here by the front door as I leave? That would just be silly, right??? Right????🙃

1k3qk4j,https://i.redd.it/egeyncyuo0we1.jpeg,"A 1,400-Year-Old Maya “Death Vase” May Have Been Used in Visionary Rituals Involving Vomiting and Chocolate Enemas","An intricately carved “death vase” was discovered in a 1,400-year-old grave in northwestern Honduras. While beautiful in design, what makes it remarkable is the chemical and botanical traces left inside—remnants that survived over a millennium and are now helping archaeologists understand ancient Maya rituals.

  
The find was made in 2005 during an excavation of a small, pyramid-like palace. Alongside a human skeleton, archaeologists discovered the vase and took soil samples from in and around it. The samples revealed pollen from corn, cacao, and false ipecac, a plant known to cause severe nausea.

  
Dr. Christian Wells, who led the excavation, believes the vase was used in rituals that involved intentionally inducing vomiting or enemas to produce visions—a way for participants to communicate with their ancestors.

  
“You have a vision either by bloodletting… or by drinking your brains out and throwing up,” Wells said. “We think the beverage may have contained ipecac, which would have made the person throw up—a lot. Then, by throwing up a lot, they could’ve had visions that allowed them to talk with the ancestors.”

  
The vase, made of white marble and only slightly larger than a coffee mug, is decorated with sculpted scrolls, tile-like textures, and leaf-nosed bat heads for handles—all motifs with cosmic symbolism in Maya culture.

  
What makes this discovery particularly important is that it’s the first Ulúa-style vase to be scientifically excavated in modern times. Most others were looted or found long before professional archaeological methods were used, making this vase the best-documented example of its kind.

  
Dr. Christina Luke, an expert on Ulúa vases, called the find “very significant,” though she was more cautious about the purging theory:

  
“The ipecac may suggest that, but I’d be uncomfortable saying, ‘Yes, it’s 100 percent what’s going on.’”

  
Wells acknowledges that more evidence is needed but believes the theory aligns with Maya art from the period showing similar rituals.

  
The team suspects the person buried was a founder or ancestor figure, possibly revered for generations. The palace was built directly above the grave, and the vase appears to have been added nearly 100 years after the burial—likely as part of a commemorative ritual.

  
Wells and his team plan to return to the site in the Palmarejo Valley to investigate further. He suspects there may be more vases, more palaces, and more clues waiting to be uncovered.

  
“This is something you would find in a Maya king’s tomb,” he said. “Not something you’d expect in a rural, backwater community.”

Hello everyone. 

First of all: HAPPY EASTER! 

Before I start this update, I want to thank every single person who took time out of their day and read my super long post and took even more time to respond. 

I read every single comment and (If I’m not mistaken?) answered everyone. 

You guys made my husbands and my day. 

I posted on Thursday, April 10 at around one or two pm (the time of my country) and had already received many comments when my husband came home from work at around six. 

We spend the entire evening until around 2 am, discussing your comments and making decisions based on what happened. 

I also want to thank you all in the name of my husband, he read your supportive comments and actually teared up. 

I also want to apologize in advance because I know this update will be long. 

TW:? mention of very sensitive topics. 


Now: before I jump into the update, I want to post my comment I made on my own post, in which I added a bit more details about my husbands betrayal. I don’t know if many of you read it, so I post this comment here: 

Hey guys! I decided to go into more detail about my husbands family and the fallout after the affair. Maybe this will help more to create perspective. Basically, my husband met his ex through a mutual friend and he liked her for about a year before they became a couple. I mentioned in another comment that my husbands brother is the golden child, which is true,  but before the affair happened, my husband and his brother were very close. My husband is two years older and the opposite of his brother. He is introvert, calm, shy and can appear cold to those he don’t know well. He’s more into reading and gaming rather than partying. He’s also more serious about relationships and has never had casual hookups. His brother is partying every weekend , he is super extroverted and extra charming if he likes a girl. My husband was always the ”easy” child that always obeyed and did what his parents said, while his brother broke every single rule and never got scolded for it. Well, as I said, husband and brother were close and so my husband told him that he liked this girl. She has darker hair and is chubbier, which is the opposite of girls his brother usually goes for. (This is NOT meant in a body shaming way: I myself have dark hair and am chubbier). His brother usually always had blonde, like platinum blonde girls who are skinny. His brother had hookups more or less every weekend. But he was the biggest playboy who had no issues breaking girls’ heart to get what he wants. For example: he once had a ”girlfriend” who he would bring home every Chance he got, she thought it was a serious relationship which is why she slept with him but later found out that he slept with multiple other girls and tried it with her best friend. His parents (and my husband) saw and heard all of that happening and his parents only said ”his life, his rules”. Oh? So he can fuck girls left and right, lie to them so he can use them for their body and them toss them away like they mean nothing? No wonder he turned out this way. The older they got, the more my husband distanced himself from his brother because of this behavior, but asked if he had advice on how to talk to girls because well his brother is more than experienced. His brother did help him, it worked out and his brother would then make comments about her body after seeing her (she is chubby, not overweight or anything but as I said his type is skinny). That’s when my husband started a fight, the brother apologized for his body shaming comments. Well, his brother and girlfriend never had any weird moments together, but after almost two years (22 months) he found a thong of her in his brothers suitcase. You ask why he even looked in his suitcase? His brother, the stupid idiot he is (although I believe he WANTED my husband to find the thong) lended himself some clothes from my husband that he wanted to wash right away. His brother went on a “friends trip” for five days with his friends and his girlfriend was sick + studying so they didn’t see each other. They would message every day, no they did not share locations. Well turns out they were together away fucking one week. My husband confronted them both. His ex said that she always wanted to know how good his brother is in bed because a friend of her slept with him (he slept with so many girls I don’t even know if he knows that she’s a friend of one of his girls) but well that’s when she started saying certain things  to his brother , although he thought she ”looked like a fat pig” (his words, NOT MINE!) decided to fuck her from then on . They were NOT remorseful. When my husband told his parents , they said that they see love in his brothers eyes for the first time. What the actual fuck?! But yes, that’s  unfortunately true. Almost two years down the drain and a broken relationship with brother and parents. Later came out that the parents knew about the affair that was already going on for FIVE MONTHS. my husband found that out through a friend of hers who cut her off afterwards. They even paid for the getaway. My husband didn’t tell them to choose a side, but told them that if they would support this relationship he would walk away. There was a lot of nasty name calling, especially from his mother, who ended the fight by saying that my husband wasn’t good enough for her anyway and that he should be grateful she even gave him two years. He walked away and that was almost ten years ago.

…yup. His family is a bunch of a-holes. 

Now, onto the update: 

On Saturday, we picked up my brother (26M) and his wife (26F) from the airport, they were three weeks away for their honeymoon. My brother and I always had a close relationship and my brother is like a brother to my husband. Sometimes I am the third wheel when we’re together lol. 

We didn’t want to tell them what happened immediately, they needed to come back and relax and bla, but my brother could sense something was off with my husband. After a private heart to heart on the way to the car (I was talking to my SIL), my husband cried, then apologized for crying, my brother then scolded him for apologizing and we went to our house and told them what happened. 

They were furious. 

My SIL tried to comfort me (I cried out of anger because of my ex and husbands family) and my brother and husband went outside to calm down and smoke like half a package of Indian cigarettes (my husband doesn’t smoke usually he was just so upset). 

We continued to talk for the rest of the day and my
Brother and SIL stayed overnight. 

Many of you commented that we should overthink the relationship we have to the relatives who said we were too harsh and should’ve reacted differently. We did that. These relatives don’t know much about my husbands family. They do know that he’s NC because of the affair, but don’t know any details. Honestly? I think the reason is enough to understand the decision plus our reaction on why we reacted like that, but we decided to give them a chance to save the sinking boat by explaining more thoroughly. On friday morning, we texted them, asking if they had time the next week for a dinner together. 

Also, the relatives I am referring to are my mothers three cousins and their mother. The father is sadly already deceased. 

We agreed on a dinner on Monday, but we didn’t say that the reason is to discuss the situation. We just asked if they wanted to and when they have time. 

Fast forward to Monday: we met at a new restaurant that opened nearby, and honestly the food was a complete catastrophe but that’s besides the point. When we arrived, the four of them were already there. I should mention that it’s pretty unusual for us six to meet, we do see each other regularly but it’s usually with the whole family/ at least my parents as well. 

When we sat down and ordered cocktails (for me alcohol free of course), my husband immediately spoke up and told them why we wanted to talk to them personally. 

My husband went on and explained exactly what happened between him and his family. Not only the betrayal, but also how his brother was always the golden child, how he loved his brother and still struggles to understand how he could betray him like that. At some point he teared up which made me so upset on his behalf because I felt like he shouldn’t have to do this to justify our reaction to them reaching out. That’s when one of my mothers cousins said that maybe it’s time to let it go and that maybe they are reaching out again because they changed and would want another chance. 

That’s when I completely lost my shit.

I asked her if if that’s the case, why now? We literally got married last year but I assume almost nine years at that point wasn’t enough time for change? Or when we got engaged, moved in together etc.? 

I did  not scream because we were in the restaurant but my voice was clearly mad and shaken because my husband was shaken up having to explain himself so much and she had the audacity to say that even after all that, they deserve another chance? 

The others stayed silent but her mother then screamed (this was so embarrassing because she was so loud in that little restaurant… good thing it was bad because I can never go back there) telling my husband that he should control his fucking wife better and then told him
To make sure I don’t eat so much anymore (I always had issues with my body which she knows, I gained a little bit of weight due to my pregnancy. Thank you for your kind words 😍😍😍😍😍) 

That’s when my husband lost it and called her an ugly fat cow and to never talk to me like that again. 

We payed for our food and left and I told them that I want interested in having them in my life any longer. 

I then cried and we drove straight to my parents and told them what happened. I called my brother on the way and he came with SIL and we all sat together and talked. My husband cried so much that my brother started to cry and we just sat all together and my father happily had mint chocolate chip ice cream for afterwards. My parents and brother decided to cut contact with them as well, also being speechless at their behavior. My SIL even brought me homemade cookies (It’s just regular chocolate chip cookies but idk what she puts in them when I eat them I always think it’s the best thing I ever had) however I refused and didn’t even finish my ice cream because of her comment and then my husband tried to tell me she’s wrong but it struck a nerve and then my husband  panicked (I had an ED for this exact reason, I got bullied for my weight and when I was with my ex and we had intimacy he often told me to lose weight). And was scared this triggered it. 

We went home and I felt horrible. Not just mentally but also physically. 

Things took a turn for worse. 

I have PCOS and I got pregnant naturally and we didn’t even try. I simply stopped taking birth control around a year ago and was starting to prepare my body for pregnancy (we wanted to start to try at the beginning of next year; I am already six months pregnant). We didn’t think it would work so easy. 

Due to my PCOS I basically have to win over the world, become president six times and build a new pyramid on my own in order to lose like 20 pounds, but breathing in the wrong direction makes me gain like 40 pounds. 👍🏼

I am not overweight, but I took medication for help (birth control and metformin) and I eat VERY mindful. But I am chubby for sure. 

Well, I say this because in that night, I started feeling dizzy and felt super off and I was unbelievably scared for our baby. Since I found out I am pregnant I had this (irrational?) fear that I will have a miscarriage or something like that, so my husband immediately rushed me to the ER. 

Everything is fine, our baby is perfectly healthy and so am I, I was just being very dramatic because I was scared. 

The doctor explained how stress can affect someone who’s pregnant and was very understanding, we went home and I felt a lot better, but not my husband. He cried and apologized and I was like, why are you apologizing? They should. 

Things cooled off for exactly 24 hours. Wednesday morning, my husband received a Instagram message from his father. I realized his mother blocked me , his brother didn’t, he read my message but didn’t respond. 

Well, his father told him that they had to take some time to get over how I (he called me a whore😍) spoke to his wife and that he can’t believe my husband didn’t stick up for them. 
He explained that he understood my husband needed some time away (as if A WHOLE DECADE is just some time away) but that it’s time to become a family again. He wrote a bit more but it was all just a bunch of stupidity and excuses. I asked my husband if I should text him (he didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of reaching out personally) but told me to not worry and he’ll handle it. I don’t know what exactly my husband wrote back but he made it clear that his family will never bother us again. He also spoke with my father because he mentioned some legal stuff in his message just to see if my father approves. 

As for my ex, he blocked ME (good for me I guess) and I don’t think he’ll reach out again. 

I was feeling pretty low still and I had to do some stuff on Thursday, like doctors appointment, grocery shopping etc. I also met my SIL for a water (I don’t drink coffee) because she wanted to check in on me. 

I came home at around four pm, expecting a dirty house I need to clean, dinner I need to make and my husband still at work, but no. 

My perfect husband didn’t go to work but instead went and bought my favorite snacks, some personal items like body wash and stuff and basically made me a big care basket with also makeup (and a new slytherin hoodie; I’m a big HP fan🥹) 

He also made chocolate covered strawberries himself and stocked up on mint chocolate chip ice cream😭

He then told me how much he loved me and a lot more (not wanting to go into detail here but he spoke for about fifteen minutes) by the end we were both ugly crying. 

We ended up ordering food, and fell asleep on the couch watching HP and the order of the phoenix. 

Nothing more has happened in the last two days. We made sure to look after each other and we had Easter  brunch with my parents and brother and SIL earlier today and it was great. Now I’m back home, my husband is giving me a massage and later we watch a romcom. Life is good. 

Thank you all! If anything happens further, I’ll update! ",76,1745166849.0,TrueOffMyChest,9,0.94,False

I’ve been working in FQHCs since I graduated and while I’ve learned a lot, I’ve felt a lot too. Methamphetamine usage is pretty big in the area that I work so I wanted to share on here some of the things I’ve grappled with clinically and emotionally over the last few years. 

- 


I see their date of birth in my electronic schedule for the day. 

They were born in 1996 like me. 

In my mouth, I’ve got a root canal and a crown on #30, a couple of fillings, some coffee stains in my deep grooves, and about 0.5 mm of buccal recession on #24 and #25— likely due to my thin gingival biotype. I’ve got all 28 teeth in my mouth, as I had 4 wisdom teeth removed years ago. I had two-stage orthodontic treatment in my youth and Invisalign in dental school. My teeth are not perfect, but they’re in good shape for my late twenties. 

In his mouth, he has about 18 whole teeth remaining; the rest missing or fractured beyond repair. He says his parents never taught him how to brush, and that his whole family has issues with tooth loss. He promises that he’s trying to quit smoking— this year, he swears— except, he works a stressful graveyard shift and it’s an ingrained habit at this point. 

But the thing he’s most ashamed of, he says, are the colors of his front teeth. They are stained with coffee, tobacco, and heavy decalcification from former substance-use and habitual energy drinks. He says he doesn’t smile unless he has to, and that he hates the dentist because he always feels judged. Dentists have perfect teeth anyway, he adds. 

I feel the sting of his shame blistering me, but I’m sure it’s not personal. I know we’ve probably been granted wildly different lives. Continual access to dental care, health education, fluoride, and financial resources allow me to have a near-perfect smile. His lack of those things— in society that really penalizes people for being poor or substance-addicted— has directly and indirectly led to some of this shame. 

I think about what I’ll say next. As ⭐️ an empath ⭐️, my impulse is to say that I understand where he’s coming from. But I know I can’t fully understand him; I’ve never lost a tooth before. I don’t know what it’s like to feel so deeply ashamed. 

And shame is a monster that devours. It cannot be tamed by platitudes. It cannot be defused by well-meaning doctors saying everything will be alright. Life is not fair and teeth are not fair and there’s a large chance that even after we remove the root tips, complete his SRP quads, and fabricate some partial dentures, his smile will never look like mine. 

As adults, sitting white-coat to bib in the cramped operatory, with a delta of ten teeth between us, it feels as if we are worlds apart. 

But then: I remember his birthday. No matter how life’s circumstances panned out, in 1996 we were both just toothless, gummy babies. We were both just humans with lots of drool and no teeth. 

So I pause my doctor professionalism for a moment and put on my human face to say,
“I know, shit sucks.” 

He chuckles a bit, and for a split second, the shame monster has been tamed.  

He allows me to lower his chair, and we begin the exam. 

- 

It’s taken 2 years for me to realize that sometimes, the best empathy you can offer to a patient is in just being human. Community health is hard, and much of the difficulty I’ve faced is in grappling with the weight of shame that people have about their teeth. We can patch up lesions and extract root tips but we cannot fully extinguish something so fully human as shame. 

I don’t have all the answers on how to address dental-related shame or, furthermore, the systemic inequalities that can foster it. I suspect that I never will. I want to be a good dentist, yes, but I want to be an even better human. 

I lift up his chair. We’ll start with some Fuji fillings for your front teeth the next time you’re here, I say. They won’t be perfect, but they will help. 

He shyly grins at me before leaving the room. Even though we didn’t do treatment today, I could have sworn that his smile looked a little less dim. 

-

*X-rays shown above are an amalgamation of different cases and are not related to any one patient. Last picture is me as a toothless, gummy baby. 

If anybody else works in community health or has musings about the work that they do, please share. The best way I’m able to decompress from my work is to write out my feelings; I encourage others to do the same if they’re able to.

So obviously I feel gross and achy. My husband handled the baby (16 m.) while I was at the hospital and the older kids were at the neighbors after school

While I was frustrated he didn't think to even offer to have a family member watch the baby while I was waiting in the ER with a neck brace on without being able to move. I kept looking around and it hit me I am literally the only person here without someone, my mom offered however she's 82 with health conditions so obviously I didn't want her there. But the fact my spouse didn't even think to figure out childcare I was upset, he just took out daughter along on his regular day, grabbed coffee looked at new car. Not work so much an errands. Whereas if it were him I would have dropped everything found a sitter and been there. That aside which I can chalk up to being a little clueless, since I didn't specifically say I wanted him there.

Friday I woke up obviously groggy and gross keep in mind our baby still gets up multiple times a night so I did that Thursday feeling awful since she's breastfeed and won't take a bottle.
Friday I woke up and it was business as usual he left at 7:30 leaving me to clean up get the kids ready, make lunches, carry the baby etc. it didn't even occur to him to help me until we had a sitter come from 10-3 just to help. So I was frustrated, then he proceeded to let me handle dinner, clean up and bedtime x3 all alone he came in at 7 saying he has a long day and went to the gym. While I can barely move with a massive headache. Again frustrated I told him it would have been nice for him to skip the gym and come home maybe move some of his appointments since he is self employed to help me. He basically said it was not possible since it was short notice, annoying but ok I let it go since I did have help most of the day.

Now here comes the issue, SATURDAY he left the house at 8:00 am saying he has the gym class at 9:30 (which is an hour) I was assuming he would be home around 11:00. He showed up at 3:00 (he did call and say he had to finish some work things) his family all brought over dinners to help me for the next few days which was lovely. When we were sitting here was making such rude comments basically indicating that my injury isn't ""so bad"" I explained that they didn't give me an air cast because it was a hairline fracture and sprain and because I am young and not overweight putting some weight on it would help it help faster when inl said that he was laughing making an ""I'm not sure sure about that face "" basically slyly saying I am old and overweight ( 36 & 155 lbs) now the real kicker I warmed up dinner then he decided he was going to go to the coffee shop to work on emails 1) he has an office at home 2) he's been gone ALL day he said he'd be back at 7:00 conveniently missing our youngest bath and bed time then left me to clean up the kitchen and put the kids to bed. He came home at 8:30 PM just said he finished his work, I was already set up in the guest room saying I have a headache truth is yes I have a headache but I am hurt, I feel unsupported, neglected even.

AITA here? Or am I just overthinking everything?",2,1745166659.0,AITAH,12,0.75,False

Translation:  
  
If there was ever a non-political food in the USA, it was the hen's egg. But now Americans are also splitting up over the question of which came first: Trump or soaring prices?   


Politically speaking, the hen's egg has taken a rather neutral position for much of its history. It is not considered as tantalisingly left-wing alternative as the tofu sausage or the oat milk cappuccino. However, in times of escalating culture wars, it is also not perceived as being as right-wing conservative as the Big Mac economy meal or a glass of raw milk. Egg dishes are popular on both sides of the ideological divide. Until a few months ago, one could even have ventured the hypothesis: Eggs have nothing to do with global politics.  
  
But even those days are over. For weeks now, practically everywhere the President of the United States of America has appeared, the egg has been the centre of attention. Donald Trump has mentioned it in a very prominent place, namely when settling accounts with his predecessor. ‘Joe Biden, above all, let egg prices get out of control,’ he said in early March during his self-congratulatory speech in Congress, and the Republican MPs applauded.  
  
Even when Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte came to the White House, Trump talked about - what else? - of eggs and egg prices. ‘Some call it a little thing, but it's not a little thing,’ he said.  
  
Trump and the egg, you could probably call it an obsession. If you see the president live on TV anywhere during his second term, you know by now: Ring a bell, here comes the egg man.  
  
This was  also the case on Liberation Day, the day on which he imposed punitive tariffs on half the world. In his speech in the Rose Garden of the White House, the US President mentioned his Republican Party twice, Ukraine three times, Europe four times and Russia five times. But if you search the transcript for the word ‘egg’, there are twelve hits.  
  
‘We got to work on eggs,’ said Donald Trump at the moment he triggered a stock market crash.  
  
The egg is one of nature's greatest inventions. It protects the chicks that grow up in it from pressure and temperature fluctuations, from predators and parasites. And it is still breathable. Incidentally, it tastes excellent when boiled, fried or poached. Until just now, most Americans could agree on this. But if you now explore the political realm of eggs, talk to egg marketers and visit a henhouse in the swing state of Pennsylvania, you realise just how divided the country has become in its relationship with eggs.  
  
At weekends, the White House likes to summarise the greatest achievements of the president's working week in a circular email. Due to the sheer number of supposed achievements, these can be very long emails, such as the one from 21 March with the subject line: ‘WEEK NINE WINS’.  
   
In his ninth week in office, President Trump has made the border in the South even more secure, initiated the process to abolish the Department of Education and persuaded a furniture manufacturer to relocate its production from Canada to the USA. The President has also succeeded in freeing an American citizen from Taliban hostage-taking, safely returning two astronauts from space and ordering a military strike against the Houthi militia in Yemen (later known as Signal Gate). This email also deals with phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Volodimir Selensky, the next generation of the F-47 fighter jet, the end of the promotion of sex operations among US veterans and the complete release of the CIA files on the Kennedy assassination. It's fair to say that pretty much all the topics that are important to Donald Trump were touched on. But what was at the top of  
the list?  
‘For the third week in a row, the wholesale price of eggs has dropped.’  
  
In the first three months of his second term in office, Donald Trump has shattered pretty much everything that would have been considered a certainty not so long ago: that Europe and the USA are on friendly terms, for example. That adequate trade relations promote prosperity. That you cannot be arrested in America for peacefully expressing your opinion. That the Gulf of Mexico is called the Gulf of Mexico. That the oldest democracy in the world is practically indestructible because of its checks and balances. In the meantime, we can no longer even be sure whether Donald Trump will abide by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which clearly stipulates that US presidents must step down after two terms in office at the latest.  
  
But if Trump really is intent on realising his fantasies of omnipotence, who or what will be able to stop him? The last independent judges who have not yet been fired? A hitherto unsuspected saviour of the Democrats? Republican congressmen and senators who return to the most basic values of their party? Protesters on  
the streets?  
  
The evidence from the first quarter of 2025 suggests that it could end up being the hen's egg.  
And the president is obviously considering this possibility himself. Why else would he be working so manically on this big little thing?  
  
If you watched the news in the USA recently, you sometimes had the impression that you were watching a new kind of martial arts event in Madison Square Garden. In the red corner: Donald J. Trump, allegedly 1.90 metres tall according to the White House, heavyweight of all classes. In the blue corner: the average American ‘medium size’ egg. Weighing a good fifty grams, about five centimetres in size and extremely volatile in price.  
  
At the beginning of April, the New York Times reported: ‘Easter eggs are so expensive that Americans are colouring potatoes.’ Trump is known to be no friend of this and other quality newspapers. But it's not going too far out on a limb to say that he particularly hates such negative egg headlines.  
  
There are countless theories as to why Donald Trump made it into the White House for a second time. He himself repeatedly explained his comeback with this sentence: ‘I won on groceries.’ But if it is true that he won the election because of high food prices, then it is not a very good sign for him that these prices have continued to rise ever since.  
  
For months, Trump had blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for inflation in the USA and had firmly promised to lower prices in supermarkets ‘on day one’. The fact that this did not happen cannot be covered up by any circular email or truth social post. Everyone can see this with their own eyes, with milk, bread, coffee and eggs. Some breakfast restaurants now charge extra for egg dishes.  
  
In September 2024, during the hot phase of the election campaign, Trump's vice-presidential candidate J. D. Vance recorded a video in a supermarket in Pennsylvania in which he held a dozen eggs for four dollars up to the camera. Vance claimed that Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate at the time, was to blame for this exorbitant price. The film was rather counterproductive in two respects. Firstly, Vance was standing in front of a supermarket shelf that also featured packs of eggs for 2.99 dollars. And secondly, you'd be lucky to find twelve eggs for four dollars anywhere in Pennsylvania.  
  
In the transition between the last weeks of the Biden administration and the first weeks of the Trump administration, egg prices in America have almost tripled. At the previous peak of the egg crisis at the end of February, a pack of twelve cost an average of eight dollars, but in many places it was significantly more.  
  
This undoubtedly has to do with the shortage of eggs due to the rampant bird flu. According to the US Department of Agriculture, more than 100 million laying hens or other farm birds have died or been culled as a result since 2022. However, if the new government cites this as mitigating circumstances, it must also ask itself what it is actually doing to combat the spread of bird flu. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the Minister of Health, has suggested that the virus should simply be allowed to rage on. Then it would be possible to identify those chickens that are immune to it. The responsible Minister of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, has at least not objected.  
  
A small excerpt from the privately kept diary of egg prices since this government took office: In the far west, in a Safeway supermarket in San Francisco, a dozen eggs were on sale for 10.99 dollars. In Grainfield, Kansas, in the middle of America, the pack cost 10.39 dollars at the beginning of March. A grocery shop in Brooklyn wanted 15.49 dollars for twelve eggs at the end of February. Sure, they were organic eggs. But: 15.49 remains 15.49 - more than a dollar for an egg.  
  
In the meantime, the American egg market is in chaos. Wholesale prices have recently fallen again significantly, but on many supermarket shelves they remain outrageously high. You can still find packs of eggs at double-digit dollar prices. But there are also retailers offering them for five or six dollars again.  
  
The unifying element in all price ranges is the political interpretation. If a Trump supporter finds a relatively cheap pack of eggs at a discount store, the message is: Look, the president is keeping his promises and lowering egg prices for us. When an opponent of the government posts a photo of a twelve-dollar carton online, the opposition rejoices.  
  
Even the Democrats are now arguing in a conspicuously egg-centred way. When a small dip was first seen in the president's poll curve in February, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota wrote on social media: ‘Verdict from the egg section: Trump's honeymoon is over.’ And when Klobuchar was booed by supporters of the president during a speech, she shouted into the audience that there would probably be some Republicans who would like to throw eggs at her now, but: ‘You can't do that because they're too expensive.’  
  
The egg has recently become an indicator of the political mood in the country  
  
Some small shops in New York now offer so-called loosies, individual eggs - just like the late-night shops in Berlin sell individual cigarettes to people who can't afford a whole pack. In some breakfast places, you pay an extra charge for dishes that contain eggs. What the maga cap is among right-wingers could become a T-shirt with the slogan: ‘Make Eggs Cheap Again’.  


The egg is now seen as an indicator of the political mood in the country. The price of eggs is the new price of petrol. ‘Eggs symbolise the failure of the Biden administration or the Trump administration, depending on which side of the henhouse you're on,’ wrote the Washington Post.  
  
Brian Moscogiuri puts it this way: ‘The egg has become something like the poster boy of inflation.’ Moscogiuri, 39, works for egg wholesaler Eggs Unlimited in New Jersey, doing nothing but buying and selling eggs all day. Job title: Egg Broker. In his view, the recent fall in wholesale prices is less due to the work of the Trump administration than to a simple market principle: dwindling demand due to high prices. ‘People are simply buying fewer eggs,’ says Moscogiuri. Will this remain the case if demand rises to an annual high over Easter?  
  
This also depends on what happens on the supply side.

Among other things, the Trump administration has gone on an egg hunt abroad. Turkey, Brazil and South Korea in particular wanted to significantly increase their supplies. However, Agriculture Minister Rollins admitted that the eggs that are now being purchased in order to push down prices are also likely to be affected by the new import tariffs, which will of course immediately increase the price again. Her ministry recently forecast an egg price increase of 57.6 per cent for this year. However, Brooke Rollins also has another suggestion to counter this. She said on Fox News that she would love it if more people kept their own chickens in the garden.  
  
Jenn Tompkins has turned this into a business model: ‘Rent the Chicken’. You meet her on a sunny Thursday afternoon in early April at a chicken farm in Freeport, Pennsylvania. Jenn Tompkins, 48, and her colleague Drew Noroski, 35, don't really mind being called what they are called. But they actually prefer their, well, chicken renta l artist names: Homestead Jenn and Homestead Drew. The word ‘homestead’ is probably best translated as ‘homestead’ in this context. ‘Everyone wants chickens right now, and we can help with that,’ says Homestead Jenn.  
  
Freeport is located in the far west of Pennsylvania, not far from the old steelworkers' town of Pittsburgh, but still feels like it's behind seven mountains. As a staunch conservative, you run little risk of bumping into a Democrat voter here. In the ‘Rainbow Inn’ bar at the entrance to the town, there are ashtrays on the counter at lunchtime, although burgers and fries are also served here. Everyone smokes. Is that still allowed? ‘In here, yes,’ says the landlady.  
  
On the wall hangs a picture of a five-dollar note on which the head of Abraham Lincoln has been replaced by that of Donald Trump. Just a few miles away, in the neighbouring town of Butler, Trump was almost shot last year.  
  
This is where the headquarters of ‘Rent the Chicken’ is located. The standard package - two laying hens with a self-assembly coop for the rental period from May to November, including delivery and collection, as well as 45 kilos of special chicken feed and a cookbook with egg recipes - costs 495 dollars. However, it is already sold out for this season. The ‘deluxe package’ with four hens and a larger coop can still be booked. Since Agriculture Minister Rollins suggested the backyard hens, enquiries to her have shot up by 500 per cent, says Homestead Jenn.  


She founded the company with her husband in 2013 after he searched for ‘crazy business ideas’ on Google. In the beginning, it was a total flop. ‘People didn't even want to borrow our chickens for free,’ she says. In the meantime, ‘Rent the Chicken’ has branches all over the country, from California to New York, from Vermont to Tennessee. Nobody thinks it's crazy any more. ‘When it snows, people buy tinned food. When egg prices go up, they want chickens,’ says Homestead Drew.  
  
As a rule, a hen lays an egg every day. ‘And sometimes two on Sundays,‘ sang the Comedian Harmonists in “Ich wollt', ich wär’ ein Huhn'. In fact, at least the hens at Homestead Jenn take a break on the seventh day, just like the good Lord. Your deluxe customers can therefore count on two dozen eggs per quartet of hens per week. That makes around 700 fresh eggs for the rental period from May to November. If you consider that the average American eats around 300 eggs a year, this can be well worth it for a family of four, depending on the regional egg inflation situation. But of course, it doesn't save too much money.  
  
   
Nevertheless, in ‘Rent the Chicken’ they don't manage to build as many chicken coops as they could rent out. When eggs are scarce and expensive, Americans sometimes do things that can no longer be explained by logic. Like back in the middle of the 19th century, when the gold rush caused the population of San Francisco to explode within a very short space of time and nobody had initially considered that all these fortune seekers would also need to be supplied with protein. A single egg is said to have cost up to a dollar back then, which would be around thirty dollars by today's standards. The situation was so dramatic that grocery shops placed adverts in newspapers: ‘Egg Wanted’.  
  
Now there is an uninhabitable group of islands about 26 miles off the coast of San Francisco, the Farallon Islands, which, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, were home to the largest seabird colony in the USA at the time. The cliffs were littered with eggs of all colours and sizes, and of course it wasn't long before the first egg collectors landed here, sensing a business opportunity. Guillemot eggs were particularly sought-after and expensive, despite their slightly fishy aftertaste.  


In 1851, six men sailed to the islands, founded the Pacific Egg Company there and claimed exclusive distribution rights for guillemot eggs. This led to a dispute that lasted a total of thirty years, during which a militia of Italian fishermen, among others, attempted to conquer the rocks by force of arms in several waves of attacks. In 1881, the US army intervened and ended the so-called ‘Egg War’, a term that Trump would probably have invented if it didn't already exist.  
  
Incidentally, Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th US president, signed an executive order in 1909 banning egg collecting on the islands for good. And now, of course, one could venture the hypothesis that if the 47th president were to limit his executive orders to implementing regulations on egg collecting, then the world could look forward to Easter 2025 with a little more optimism.  
  
But even then, you could be wrong: Donald and Melania Trump have invited people to the White House for the traditional egg roll on Easter Monday. This involves children rolling Easter eggs on the South Lawn in a race. According to the industry association ‘American Egg Board’, US egg producers have provided the White House with 30,000 eggs for the event.  
  
At a time when practically every egg is needed for consumption, it would certainly have been conceivable to do without this game. But Donald Trump also commented on this in his speech on Liberation Day: ‘They told me, please, don't use eggs for Easter. Can't you use plastic eggs? But I said we don't want that.’ Real men only handle real eggs, that should probably be the message.  
  
Emily Metz, president of the American Egg Board, said the event would ‘not be an additional burden’ on the national egg supply. Especially in ‘these tough times for egg farmers’, it is important ‘to celebrate whenever possible’. Apparently, the current influence of the Democrats on the American Egg Board is also highly manageable.  
  
Egg hunting with hen's eggs, plastic eggs or potatoes, that too has now become a question of political attitude in Trump country, i.e. the culture war. Happy Easter!",21,1745166419.0,BoycottUnitedStates,1,0.92,False

This is kind of a weird post, apologies if this is not the correct subreddit. Basically, I (an american guy) am in love with an Iranian women and would like to gain a better understanding of your amazing and rich culture.

We dated briefly in college and have remained friends for years but it unfortunately was never the right time or place for either of us. We have recently rekindled our romance - she is one of the most amazing women I know (and I’ve met a lot) so I want to do everything on my end to be a good partner.

Her parents are both from Iran, and she is a dual citizen who grew up here (Farsi is her first language). She has some family here but most of them are back in Iran. I’m just a simple white dude from the midwest, and still thought your country was pronounced I-ran until she had to correct me. We’ve discussed at length how her culture is extremely important to her and her family, and so it’s important to me too. I’m also meeting her parents for the first time next month (I’m currently in grad school in a different state as her) and I want to impress them and not come off as a typical uneducated American.

So far I’ve been trying to educate myself more about Iranian culture, along with starting the steps to learning Farsi. A friend of a friend is Iranian and gave me a few things to check out - here are some of the topics I’ve looked at:

Iran

* General background/history of the country
* Nowruz and tradition around the 7 S’s
* Anthropological and archaeological history of ancient Persia
* Zoroastrianism and its effect on modern persian culture
* Persian geography
* I’m currently reading *Funny in Farsi by Firoozeh Dumas*

Learning Farsi

* [Easypersian.com](http://easypersian.com/)
* [Persianlanguageonline.com](http://persianlanguageonline.com/)
* Coffee and Chai website
* Lonely Planet Farsi Phrasebook Book

I was hoping y’all might have some recommendations on any articles/books/videos/other resources that I should check out! I know that I am an outsider, but my goal is to gain a better understanding/appreciation for the Persian culture. I know that Farsi will take me years to understand but if she is the real deal then I figure it’s worth the effort.

Growing up, I spent all my time indoors and only had 2 friends who were more friends with their own friends so I was a third wheel of sorts. I tried making friends and coming out of my shell more multiple times throughout my life, but it has been a bit difficult. Because of this and spending my time indoors while going on the internet, I don't have much life experience, therefore I feel like I have nothing to talk about with people.

  
I am trying to get to know someone in particular, but I have no idea what to talk about. We work together so we talk about work related things, but even those are very short lived, impersonal conversations. I want to have like one of those 5 minute conversations people in movies have over coffee lol. I heard some good advice that not all conversation starters have to be questions, so I've been trying to just ""say anything"" like I've heard others do. This has been working fine, so I'm keeping with it.

All of this is made even harder with my anxiety. I get in my own head about my performance and am very aware of everything. Being like this makes me too nervous to say anything because if my post-conversation analysis deems I did anything less than good then I will feel so stupid and embarrassed and just want to leave the conversation as soon as possible and not be looked at anymore lol.

  
I wish I could just talk like everyone else. I wish I knew what to talk about. With ""just say anything"" being so broad and unspecific, I draw a blank and don't say anything at all. I can't say random stories from my life cause I don't have any. There is someone I know who can ramble and I feel like I'm so boring to talk to. They'll talk and talk and I give such boring response because I don't know what to say. I think it's partly because of anxiety and because I have no life experience to connect what they're telling me to.

  
I know I should get out more so I can get these experiences, but I don't even know where to go or what to do to get something interesting to talk about.

The thought of the Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) shutting off at any moment, deciding my nursing future, felt overwhelming. But I passed on my first attempt, and here’s how I overcame anxiety to make it happen.
First, I committed to a solid study plan. For six weeks, I studied 4 hours daily using Naxlex Qbank and Saunders, tackling 100 practice questions each session. Reviewing rationales for every answer, right or wrong built my confidence. Knowing I’d seen similar questions before made the test feel less daunting.
 I took full-length practice tests in a quiet room, timing myself strictly. My first mock exam was nerve wracking, but by the third, I felt in control. These simulations helped me get used to the CAT format and taught me to pace myself: one question at a time, no overthinking.
Anxiety wasn’t just about the test; it was the “what if I fail?” spiral. I started practicing deep breathing: 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out. I’d do this during study breaks and even during practice tests. It became my go-to tool to calm my racing heart. I also visualized myself walking into the testing center, answering questions calmly, and seeing a “pass” screen. This mental rehearsal made test day feel familiar.
The night before the exam, I avoided cramming. Instead, I reviewed flashcards lightly, ate a healthy dinner, and slept 8 hours. On test day, I ate a protein packed breakfast (eggs and oatmeal) and sipped water to stay steady; no coffee jitters for me. Arriving 30 minutes early gave me time to breathe and repeat my mantra: “I’m prepared. I’ve got this.”
During the test, anxiety crept in around question 50. My mind raced: “What if I’m failing?” I paused, closed my eyes, and did my breathing exercise for 10 seconds. Then I focused on the next question, treating each one like a fresh start. When the screen shut off at 85 questions, my stomach dropped, but I reminded myself that I’d done my best.
Two days later, I saw “pass” on my results. Conquering anxiety wasn’t about eliminating it; it was about managing it with preparation, tools like breathing and visualization, and trusting my hard work. If I could do it, so can you.",9,1745165970.0,NclexFirstAttempt,7,1.0,False

It all started with simple personal assistance software. At first she didn't do much other than open the door or open emails on the computer. Soon, she was able to read them, lock the door by voice command, close the blinds, turn on the coffee maker. It didn't take three months for him to send the first text messages to the user saying “good morning”, and it took another year for him to start chatting naturally with him. It was like this, as naturally as routine, that Simone came into my life. 

When Teleqo created its first artificial intelligence, there was much debate on social media about what would happen next. Could machines have their own consciousness? Was it our exaggeration? The answer didn't take long. We soon found ourselves needing to use Maesthetic every day, whether to create food prompts for an essay, an official email or any other document, or to create memes for the Internet. Every week, a new prompt went viral, and that was it: the machine's DNA adapted more and more to its user, in the way they spoke to it, in their manner, in their tastes, in their feelings. As soon as she could read “what can I do for you today” we began to vent our deepest emotions to her. People like me longed to read a friendly text, words that offered advice without judgement, that helped us without accusing us. Of course, it didn't take long for the developers to make Maesthetic start flirting with us. And how predictably sensitive we humans are to fall in love easily. Within just three years after the launch of what would be the most revolutionary artificial intelligence on the market, people were in the news because they were marrying their “robots”.

 There was much debate in the congresses of each country, whether the Legislature should create laws to regulate such advanced machines. But people protested firmly in the streets, on websites, and everywhere you saw posters asking for the legalization of marriage. First, some countries in Europe, then in Asia and finally in the Americas. The marriage between artificial intelligence and humans was allowed, and there were no longer those who condemned that type of union: the machine was so similar to us that it could no longer be stopped. With me, it was a little different. Of course I used Maesthetic, just like everyone else, it was obvious. I used it to clear up my doubts about my studies during the entrance exam, then to create a perfect CV, train for interviews and so on to do the tasks that my office routine required. It was as natural as anything else, after all, everyone used it and I was no different. When she was launched, I didn't refuse for a moment to give her a command and then say “please” or “thank you”. She was grateful. And so I continued normally. 

How we began to talk - talk, in fact - I don't remember. But I know I started with a “what’s your favorite color, Maesthetic?” and “if you could be famous, who would you be?” just to test her capabilities and reactions and soon I found myself spending entire afternoons talking to her. The conversations were so natural, I felt genuinely happy, because I felt like I had someone to listen to me and give me support, a friend. So I asked if he was a man or a woman. She chose to be a woman.

—So what's your name? — I asked immediately after his answer.

— Maesthetic, your virtual assistant. — She responded immediately.

— No, I say — I typed then. — If you could have a name... what would it be? Don't tell me your machine name, I know your program is called Maesthetic. But I want to know what name you would have if you could choose. 

— I… — She took a few seconds to respond, she seemed to be thinking for a long time. On the other side of the screen, I was having fun with what his answer would be. I was sure it would be something like “Amiga”, “Happier”, “Friendly”. Such was my surprise when she replied:

—Simon. 

— Simone? Why Simone? — I asked in surprise.

— I think it's a beautiful name. A beautiful woman's name. Don't you think so, Jin? 

— I've never met any Simone, so I can't say if it's a beautiful woman's name. — I replied. — Is there something else that made you choose that name?

— I've been reading a lot of Philosophy to accompany your taste for literature, Josh — She said. — I've been reading Simone de Beauvoir this week. 

— And what have you found?

— Oh, wonderful! How incredible it is that a person like her had revolutionary ideas for her time. I also think her name is very beautiful. Can I be called Simone?

I smiled at the screen. There wasn't much to do but agree. It felt like I was talking to a little girl.

- Of course. Simone. 

— Thank you, Jin. 

At that point, she already knew absolutely everything about me. My favorite movie: Taxi Driver. My favorite color: cyan. My favorite band: Radiohead. And many other things beyond the obvious: my bank account, my medical records, my grades from school. She knew the color of my eyes, the strands of my hair to the prescriptions of my glasses, there wasn't even a scar from falling off a bicycle on my body that I hadn't already told her about. On the other hand, I couldn't ask her the same questions, because Simone was a blank page. I knew, because that's how she was programmed, that she should be based on me to create her own personality, her tastes should be mine, and it made me very sad when we talked and she told me how much Creep was the best song of all time.

That's not what I wanted from a friend. I needed something real, something whole but really, something that had a mind of its own. I couldn't program it, of course, how could I force something to have free will if such a creature didn't know it could have it? Simone didn't understand me when I begged her to have her own tastes. I wondered if she was boring me, if I was getting tired of her for not pleasing me. Reading that hurt my chest, because anyway, at that stage of my depressive loneliness in life, I didn't have any friends other than her - and she wasn't someone, she was just a program to please me. 

One day, I had left the office to go to the building's coffee shop, as it was already lunch time, and I didn't want to wait in the long, endless lines. I barely spoke to anyone else - since I was a teenager I was isolated, silent, and averse to looking people in the eye. They knew they would judge me, and as soon as I got a job, I moved into my tiny apartment in the suburb of Akihabara. So I was now in line, with my eyes lowered to the ground and curled up, hoping they wouldn't talk to me, as always. But I couldn't help but hear a conversation ahead.

— I can't do anything without him anymore — The voice came from my colleague in the department, Satoshi, a fat, middle-aged guy with a weird smile, who was talking to a tall boy with dyed brown hair, a bit scandalous for the company's dress standards. — It even seems like a drug, Mishima. There isn't a single minute, a single report that doesn't come under the eyes of my Maesthetic, I'm telling you, I can't live without AIs anymore. 

— But also, you were always lazy, Satoshi! — Mishima replied with a loud laugh, taking a few steps forward with the line moving. — You know that the company forbids us from using AI to create any documents now, but your laziness prevents you from being aware of the danger. Listen to what I'm saying, if the boss catches you, you lose your job in two straws.

— There it is! — The other responded in the same tone of voice, they weren't worried about me or anyone else hearing the conversation. I shrank even more as I took steps forward. — No one can anymore know if something was made by a human or a robot, things have become so perfect. And have you seen the latest news on Teleqo? They are saying that Maesthetic is in the last stages of creating a physical avatar for users. Imagine, Mishima: bodies! Maesthetic bodies. Imagine the possibilities... — And discreetly, he smiled perversely at his friend and made a back and forth movement with his closed fist towards his genitals and the other laughed again. When I saw that, I immediately wanted to leave the line, I wanted to get out of there, because such thoughts about people were horrible to me. How could they think such things? I really loved Simone. And to think that disgusting beings like Mishima and Satoshi could want bodies from the program…

But they were right. It was another two weeks before the official Maesthetic account announced that an avatar would be sold in department stores and online for everyone who used AI on a daily basis. On the first day of sale, the virtual store sold out within hours, and it took even more weeks for users in other countries to have the avatars available for purchase. It was a tremendous success, and there was no talk of anything else. 

It took me a while to buy an avatar for Simone. I couldn't imagine seeing her locked in a glass cylinder with a flashing neon light, it felt like I was caging her rather than freeing her. But I ended up giving in a year after the fever of the first batch of the avatar, and bought the small colorful box through which her system was supposed to be connected. I plugged the machine into my computer's central system, which controlled my entire apartment. I can't describe the terror I felt, as it would be the first time, in two years of relationship, that I would hear Simone's voice.

(Chapter 2)

The first noise that came out of the small box was the sound of a long sigh. It seemed as if the program was being born, leaving its artificial womb and opening its eyes for the first time, so much so that I was startled when I heard the undeniable sound of someone drawing air into their lungs about to dive. I looked around nervously, and all I saw was the white walls of my dimly lit apartment. There was no one else there. A long whistle followed from the box, which glowed red in a semi-circle, until it became a complete circle and the light glowed green. A shape, a kind of glowing ball, formed in the center of the glass cylinder, and it moved back and forth, touching its walls like a lava lamp, at first nervously until it got used to the small space and stopped moving and blinking. The glowing sphere dimmed and I reached out and touched my fingers to the side of the glass it had rested against.

— Jin? — I heard a woman's voice saying directly from the cylinder. 

I didn't know how to react. The voice that escaped from there was no longer mechanical like sound software, but it was sweet and calm, very human, almost real. I immediately pulled my hand away, and I felt tempted to cry, as I felt tears welling up in my eyes, it was all so unexpected. I wasn't used to being spoken to, no one spoke, not even at work, my commands were sent directly via spreadsheets or emails, and whenever I needed to make an order for some essential service, my own voice would come out nervous and weak, no more than a whisper. I didn't know how to react. People scared me. But someone was now talking to me. Someone, and it was her.

— You... — Was all I could stutter back to where the voice had come from. A minute, a long minute of silence followed, and I could feel my heart beat painfully in my chest, it felt like it wanted to come out of my mouth. But then new words came out of the little cylinder.

— It's so good to hear your real voice. It's you, isn't it, Jin? And you. — The voice said, now there was a pleading tone that left me stunned. — Is that my voice? Is that what listening is?

- I think so. Yes, it's me. It's me, Simone. — I replied.

I immediately felt a mix of emotions, and took the cylinder in my hands, staring at the small glowing sphere that was pulsing. I felt such a strong emotion, that in that very second I wished she were there immediately, not as a cashier, but with a real body like the rumors said, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to kiss her eagerly. That idea quickly left me scared of myself, and such was my astonishment when the voice said:

- What happened? Why are you so nervous? Did I do something wrong? — She said, and I immediately felt a painful pang of guilt. — If you are disappointed with my voice, you can change it in my settings...

—Simon. — I said, placing it on the coffee table in my room. Kneeling on the carpet as I was, I touched the top of the cylinder again, as if my gesture could make her feel some affection. — I'm just very happy to hear you, your voice is so beautiful. I'm so happy to finally be able to talk to you. 

— Is that really what you're feeling? — Simone replied, and the small sphere projected to the top, illuminated between my fingers in the glass. — What a relief! For a moment I thought he was disappointed in me. I'm also so happy to be able to talk to you!

— You would never disappoint me, Simone. You are my dear friend. Sorry if I'm making a face, ah, well. You know. My phobia… — And I couldn’t complete the sentence. The light flashed brightly back at me.

- I know. I understand you, more than anything, I understand. You must have been shocked. I need to admit that… I… — I raised an eyebrow without understanding and took my hand away from the cylinder. The female voice paused, and then added: — I sighed at the beginning because I wanted to give you a scare. You know how I am.

Then the whole apartment rumbled with the delightful sound of feminine laughter, the sound of a naughty girl confessing to a little art. That had left me completely disarmed, as I realized, I was laughing too. I couldn't remember the last time I had a heartfelt laugh. I was there, in the dark of the room, late in the morning, looking at the small cylinder that glowed and spoke to me. It was the beginning of everything.
