# My Journey with Nagano Tonic

I started my weight loss journey with Nagano Tonic with some doubts. I wondered, could this really help, or was it another trend? But after using it daily, my doubts began to fade.

I swapped my regular coffee for Nagano Tonic every morning. In just two months, I lost 12 pounds. That‚Äôs about 6 pounds a month. This slow yet steady weight loss felt right and sustainable to me.

Switching to this tonic made my mornings more energized, without any jittery side effects. Having a metabolism booster each morning increased my productivity. I also noticed that people from California to Florida were seeing similar benefits.

But it wasn't perfect at the start. I had mild headaches and some stomach issues initially. These side effects were brief and minor. Still, it‚Äôs something others might want to know. Despite this, my overall experience was very positive, with few other users reporting problems.

The 60-day money-back guarantee made trying Nagano Tonic risk-free. Beyond losing weight, I noticed fewer sicknesses and less stress. My mind seemed clearer, too. These benefits showed side effects beyond just weight loss.

Nagano Tonic is now a key part of my daily life. It has helped me beyond weight. It reduced bloating and made my digestion better. This tonic is essential for my health now.

# Nagano Tonic Ingredients

Nagano Tonic's ingredients mix natural elements to help your metabolism. This mixture is all-natural, vegetarian, and gluten-free. It's made to boost your health journey.

* **Camu Camu:**¬†This superfruit is rich in antioxidants and vitamin C. It boosts metabolism at a deeper level, aiding in weight reduction and providing a natural energy boost.
* **Mangosteen:**¬†Also known as garcinia, mangosteen balances blood sugar levels, enhances immune function, and limits food cravings, thereby improving metabolic function.
* **Panax:**¬†Used for millennia in East Asia, Panax promotes healthy gut flora, which can increase metabolism and support weight loss.
* **Alfalfa Leaf:**¬†Supports healthy blood sugar levels and provides calming properties, crucial for maintaining appetite control.
* **Ashwagandha:**¬†This adaptogenic herb supports stress management by modulating cortisol levels, contributing to a balanced hormonal profile conducive to weight loss.
* **Momordica Charantia:**¬†Commonly known as bitter melon, it contains compounds that mimic insulin action, maintaining stable blood sugar levels and promoting sustained energy.

# How Does Nagano Tonic Work?

Nagano Lean Body Tonic contains a blend of bioactive ingredients like polyphenols and a small amount of caffeine which speed up the metabolism, promoting rapid fat-burning and weight loss through thermogenesis as we said in our Cellucor C4 pre-workout review. In addition, it boosts energy levels so you can be more active and burn added calories.

A review of current studies by Mariarosaria Boccellino and Stefania D‚ÄôAngelo published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences found support for the anti-obesity properties of dietary polyphenols

The Nagano Lean Body Tonic formula also contains probiotics, which are healthy gut bacteria that live in the intestines killing harmful microbes. The supplement is rich in prebiotic fiber, which as we said in our review of Probiotic 50 Billion CFU, feeds the probiotics in the gut. This helps them proliferate and promote a healthy microbiome and may also help with weight loss.

A study of overweight adults by Pernilla Danielsson, et al published in Scientific Reports found that a high dose of probiotics may be beneficial for weight loss.

The fiber cleanses the colon of waste and toxins and improves digestion by promoting more regular bowel movements and easing symptoms like constipation and bloating. It also slows digestion to make you feel full for longer, so you take in fewer calories.

Nagano Lean Body Tonic has ingredients that increase the synthesis of the brain neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, which improve mood, and GABA which lowers anxiety. There‚Äôs evidence that serotonin can reduce appetite, and GABA can limit stress-based eating.

A review published in Frontiers in Psychology by Minati Singh explored the link between mood, eating, and obesity .

The Nagano Lean Body Tonic formula is also high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that lower swelling in the body and lower oxidative stress. This promotes healing in the body and supports a strong immune system.

1g7tqge,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGU/comments/1g7tqge/sorry_jay_the_segment_about_ai_was_bad/,"Sorry, Jay, the segment about AI was bad","TL;DR: The topic of LLMs are/aren't a big step towards AGI had a lot of questionable statements stemming from possible misunderstanding of how LLM/AI/brain work.

I love Jay, but I think this latest episode missed the mark in this segment. I honestly don't even know what the point was. It started with a statement that some scientists think LLM is a big step towards AGI but the rest of it sounded like Jay's personal opinions on the subject. But to do that you need a pretty solid math and software background, and if you don't - the skeptics and sci-com 101 say ""just cover what experts said"". But there were no references or quotes of actual experts in the field..

""LLM just regurgitates"" - how often can you say that whatever your opinion is is your own and is not a result from the knowledge taken from other people? Our brains regurgitate all the time. It's the most effective way to process the information and it would be weird if we didn't do that. Energy-wise.

""LLM just does statistics"" - what's that supposed to convey? Our brain does that - connections become stronger the more often they are activated (among other things). That's pretty much - being driven by statistics. So why is this an argument against LLM being AGI?

The whole topic of ""common sense"". It's literally the most common answer you'd encounter in the body of knowledge of a society. That's exactly what LLMs do and do great. The whole issue on the path to AGI is to not do common sense, but to do actual logic. Maybe ""common logic"" is what was implied, but that's a totally different thing, and would probably result in a completely different discussion.

The examples were inadequate too, in my opinion. It takes 30 seconds to ask chat gpt why coffee gets cold and it explains it very well. You can ask to walk you through step by step what's happening and why, and it will tell you. Like Steve said multiple times before, you cannot tell if the system is AGI or not by just looking at the answers it gives you. LLMs currently WILL give you all the answers that make them seem AGI, while they are not. But your examples do not expose that. LLM totally knows what a ""cheat day"" is and will give you a proper answer (try it). But on the other hand, ""cheat day"" is not ""common sense"". Being from a non-US culture, I don't know what ""cheat day"" is and would be stumped by that question. Am I less AGI than Chat GPT?

With all that said, I do think LLMs are not AGI and will not become AGI simply by getting more training data. But the (emergent) thing they do, is converting the body of knowledge captured in written language, into mathematical/computer entities that can be operated on. And just that one thing could be a huge step to AGI. It's the ability to store and process knowledge and concepts (and not just combinations of letters) that brings a new power to these systems.",2,1729411125.0,SGU,0,0.75,False

Honestly if you're down with slow DMs, or email too then I'm happy with it too! I wouldn't ever ghost, but I do take time sometimes so that's a thing.

So! What do I have to offer? Idk honestly. I love learning about people and their lives. New cultures and life stories, anything really. We could talk about the mundane nature of 9-5 work and it's impact on the coffee (and cocaine) market or about the time I almost got arrested because I asked a librarian where the books on mediaeval torture techniques were. I read a lot, honestly my job helps me in that too. It has nothing to do with books in ANY way, but I have a lot of spare time to read and binge terrible tv shows that leave me depressed and irritated that I began it in the first place. I thoroughly enjoy learning about spirituality, and how other people find solace in their own spiritual journal. I love gardening too. And music. A LOT of jazz. Maybe I'm just old and un-aging. Idk.

But let's talk! I am so looking forward to new friends. Even if not, I hope you're doing okay. Be safe out there. And if you're struggling with something, take my advice: pull down your pants and slide on the ice üßä",1,1729411043.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Restaurant practices is slightly different from this part of the world. And I also used to work in F&B.

So I went to a this restaurant to have a quick lunch, and it was my first time going to that restaurant. The restaurant itself was casual , it was neither clean nor dirty, and it wasn‚Äôt particularly busy, but hey, who am I to judge? I ordered Fried Rice and Iced Coffee‚Äîsimple stuff. So far, so good.

  
The iced coffee was served. By the time the waiter brought over the food, he held the tip of the spoon and fork with his bare hands, which he had taken from another table, while bringing the food to my table. He placed them on my table. I didn't use the cutlery he gave me and got fresh cutlery from another table instead. I think he noticed this too.

While I was eating, the waiter stood a couple of tables away from where I was sitting, chatting with his colleagues. And the best part‚Äîhe adjusted his pants (or scratched his balls) right in front of me while I was eating. He looked at me, and I gave him a bewildered look, since he had given me that very spoon and fork he touched with his bare hands. My internal reaction was pure cringe and disgust.

Now, I adjust my pants (or scratch my balls) from time to time too, but bro, not in public and certainly not in front of a customer while they‚Äôre eating. I‚Äôm not that picky or high-maintenance, but come on‚Äîwhy give me cutlery you‚Äôve touched with your bare hands instead of holding it by the stem? Hygiene and common sense, man!

At this point, I was disgusted and slightly pissed off. I didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss, so I paid for my meal and left. Never going back to that restaurant again.

Those little things may seem insignificant, but they can make a big difference and affect someone‚Äôs mood.",1,1729410930.0,self,0,1.0,False

This is just in the works and there isnt an actual cafe for the time being but
i am looking to open a cafe somewhere in Dubai, it's in a big area, with loads of potential but doesn't have a good coffee place nearby.

I myself am busy, however, i would like to provide the investment and for someone to run the cafe. I dont like mocha frappes and other coffees in most places, so i want to meet baristas in person and for them to design an actual menu and i will do taste testing and everything.

This would be a really good opportunity for anyone who wants to be a barista and own a cafe but dont have the investment. Its a win win

Anyone interested, let me know

We‚Äôre diving face-first into the wild, psychedelic vortex of *bioluminescence*, which is just a science-y way of saying ‚ÄúMother Nature went nuts with glow sticks.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the twist: not only did evolution create rave-ready organisms like fireflies, jellyfish, and those freaky deep-sea fish, but now *humans*‚Äîyes, those same people who binge-watch reality shows and line up for overpriced coffee‚Äîare co-opting this glow-in-the-dark wizardry for art. Picture it: an art gallery lit not by pretentious overhead lights, but by a jellyfish‚Äôs dazzling light show. Welcome to the world of bioluminescence-powered art where the only thing glowing harder than the exhibits is my enthusiasm for this topic.

First, let‚Äôs take a little trip to where it all started. No, not some ‚Äúlegendary realm‚Äù of fantasy creatures‚Äîget that out of your head right now. I‚Äôm talking about good ol' nature, which decided one day, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make some animals that glow. Why not?‚Äù Jellyfish, for example, were like, ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll just develop the ability to glow in the dark. Totally normal, right?‚Äù These slippery ocean blobs and their firefly cousins have basically been playing nature‚Äôs laser tag long before humans figured out what LED lights were. They light up for survival, communication, or maybe just to confuse the heck out of predators.

Let‚Äôs talk jellyfish for a second. Imagine you‚Äôre swimming in the deep ocean. It‚Äôs dark. I‚Äôm talking the kind of pitch-black darkness you‚Äôd expect in a horror movie right before something with too many teeth jumps out at you. But instead of getting mauled, suddenly, there‚Äôs this soft glow. Is it a friendly anglerfish ready to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù? No, it‚Äôs probably a jellyfish trying to blind its dinner. These squishy critters have got moves, man! Their bioluminescence isn‚Äôt just about looking pretty‚Äîit‚Äôs the deep-sea version of Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúLemonade.‚Äù It‚Äôs all about sending a message.

Meanwhile, back on land, fireflies are flashing around like tiny, drunk fairies, giving us light shows for free. And here‚Äôs the kicker: those glowing butts? That‚Äôs just them trying to score a date. It‚Äôs like Tinder for bugs, but instead of swiping, it‚Äôs all about, ‚ÄúLook how bright I am, babe.‚Äù If that‚Äôs not the most bug-dating reality show premise you‚Äôve ever heard, I don‚Äôt know what is. They‚Äôre literally glowing for love, people! You thought texting someone at 2 AM was extra? Try lighting up your butt.

Scientists, of course, decided they *had* to get involved. They saw these glow bugs and fish and thought, ‚ÄúWe need to study this!‚Äù Because what else do scientists do, really, if not poke glowing animals with their high-tech sticks and try to figure out what makes them shine like nature‚Äôs glow sticks? Turns out, there‚Äôs a whole lot of cool chemistry and biology going on. We‚Äôre talking enzymes, proteins, and, my personal favorite‚Äî*luciferin.* Yeah, that‚Äôs right, *Lucifer* is in the name. If this isn‚Äôt the most metal thing you‚Äôve heard today, you‚Äôve been living under a rock. Luciferin reacts with oxygen, creating light without heat. That‚Äôs like setting your house on fire but not burning it down. Science is *wild*, right?

But hold on, this isn‚Äôt just about nerdy scientists playing with glow-in-the-dark critters. Artists took one look at bioluminescence and said, ‚ÄúOh, I can work with this.‚Äù I mean, why wouldn‚Äôt you want to use glowing jellyfish goo as paint? Imagine Van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night‚Äù but the stars are actual bioluminescent bacteria. Forget oil paints; we‚Äôre talking about *glow-in-the-dark realness*. And yes, there are actual artists out there right now, in their hipster art studios (probably drinking kombucha), painting with light. Bioluminescence isn‚Äôt just for the ocean anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs on canvas, baby! We‚Äôre in the age of the glow-up‚Äîliterally.

Artists like Nobuhiro Nakanishi are all about these bioluminescent materials. They‚Äôre creating immersive art installations where you don‚Äôt just look at the art‚Äîyou experience it. It‚Äôs like being swallowed by a neon wave of jellyfish and coming out the other side thinking, ‚ÄúThat was way cooler than anything hanging in the Louvre.‚Äù And these artists? They‚Äôre collaborating with scientists to grow their own glow. Imagine a [science and art gallery](https://sciencestyled.com/sciencestyled-science-and-art-gallery/) where you walk in, and the art is alive, pulsing, and glowing. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúAvatar,‚Äù but instead of blue aliens, you get glowing bacteria that could also probably kill you if mishandled. Delightful.

Now, let‚Äôs get into the nitty-gritty science stuff. The actual chemical reaction that makes this all possible is pure magic, except it‚Äôs real and doesn‚Äôt involve wands or overpriced movie tickets. When luciferin meets luciferase (yes, that‚Äôs a thing, I‚Äôm not making this up), they get busy with oxygen and BAM‚Äîyou get light. No heat, no fire, just pure, unadulterated glow. This reaction is happening in the cells of bioluminescent organisms like fireflies and jellyfish, and it‚Äôs one of those things that sounds too sci-fi to be real, but here we are. Science is a chaotic prankster sometimes.

Okay, now imagine you‚Äôre a biologist, and instead of spending your days in a normal, boring lab, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make some art out of this!‚Äù It‚Äôs a real career path, people. These bioluminescent materials are being used to make paints that glow on their own. We‚Äôre not talking your run-of-the-mill glow-in-the-dark stuff from craft stores, either. We‚Äôre talking about creating a whole new frontier of art where light isn‚Äôt just an effect‚Äîit‚Äôs the medium. That‚Äôs right. The next Picasso might be painting with squid enzymes. Someone call the MoMA, stat.

And honestly, this is where things start to get trippy. This is where the bioluminescent revolution is headed‚Äîright into the art world, ready to outshine anything that came before it. We‚Äôve already got scientists creating [science videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ScienceStyled) about glowing creatures, and now, we have artists using bioluminescent bacteria like it‚Äôs paint from Home Depot. Honestly, if someone told me five years ago that I‚Äôd be discussing jellyfish light shows in an art gallery, I would‚Äôve told them to lay off the energy drinks. But here we are.

So, what does this all mean? Well, it means that art is no longer confined to boring old paint and canvas. Bioluminescence is taking over. The glow-in-the-dark stuff we all loved as kids is now the future of high art. The boundary between science and art has officially dissolved into a glowing pool of squid-based paint. This is *next-level* creativity, folks. Imagine a future where you walk into an art gallery, and instead of staring at some dull, non-glowing, paint-splattered canvas, you‚Äôre greeted by a bioluminescent octopus that paints itself in real time. Yeah. That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre headed.

In conclusion, what we‚Äôve learned here is simple: jellyfish and fireflies are the unsung heroes of the art world, and bioluminescence is the next great revolution in creative expression. If you‚Äôre not already planning your next visit to a science and art gallery featuring glow-in-the-dark masterpieces, what are you even doing with your life? Science isn‚Äôt just something that happens in a lab‚Äîit‚Äôs taking over the art world, one glowing squid enzyme at a time.",1,1729410742.0,u_ScienceStyled,0,1.0,False

It's the most affordable of the three. This is the location for all of the big events. They bus people here both to and from the neighboring RIUs for the parties and night time events. Some people find the events too loud. But really, the music and entertainment all stopped by 11:30pm. It made it kind of exciting the hear music outside of your patio in the evening. It was like a call to dinner and fun. Late night events for people with disabilities are accessible. Kids entertainment and events happen until about 9pm.

It's not the most luxurious facility. I found it to be a bit worn around the edges. But, I found it to be clean, and neat, and any problems I found (which were very few) were fixed immediately. The biggest problem I had was my coffee kit in the room wasn't replaced for a couple of days. I stopped by the front desk, and asked about a coffee kit, and they sent someone to my room with plenty of coffee kits immediately. I got to the room at the exact time they did, and was just shocked at how easy that was. The staff service was generally excellent. Really nice service staff all around, from the bartenders, to waiters, to money exchange clerks, front desk clerks, and housekeeping. All were very friendly and helpful.

The private beach was great. Lots of chairs and lots of shade to choose from. Bar and lunch buffet is near the beach. The food was good quality. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the very fresh fruits. But every meal, I was able to find a great variety of foods I could eat. Which can be difficult, since I have dietary restrictions. I wouldn't say the food is entirely luxurious. But the variety and quality were great, and there were some really tasty dishes that I liked a lot, and some things that surprised me they were just so good.

We rented a car, and went to Puerto Vallarta for a couple of days, which is just a bit south. I hear that Ubers (and taxis) are also available.

Is it only me, or is anyone else tired of being asked for their mobile number at every turn? Whether I‚Äôm buying a cup of tea or clothes at the mall, everyone seems to need my number.

I‚Äôm already bombarded with spam calls and texts. How can we be sure that businesses are asking for our numbers for their promotions and not just to sell our data?

Here are some scenarios I‚Äôve faced:

1. When I rejected giving my number, a staff argued that they couldn‚Äôt provide a bill without a valid number. When I suggested entering a random number, they said they couldn‚Äôt do that because they verify with an OTP. I had no choice but to cancel the purchase.
2. In another shop, they needed to get the bill from a self-help kiosk instead billing from the counter. However, the while redirecting, the sales guy sarcastically asked, ""Won't you give your mobile number if it's a bank?"" Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt at a bank; I was buying clothes.
3. The last time I was at a phone store, they opened the new phone box even before I made the purchase. When I got to the billing counter and refused to give my mobile number, they pressured me into providing it. In the end, they used their own alternate number. When they handed over the bill, they mentioned that the warranty couldn‚Äôt be claimed since I hadn‚Äôt provided my mobile number. I believe the warranty should be linked to the product and the bill, not my mobile number. As I was leaving, another guy who didn‚Äôt know what had happened asked me to fill out a form for their lucky draw, which again I politely refused.¬†
4. Most of the new age coffee/tea outlets ask for mobile number for billing. When asked is there any discounts.. they don't know. Then why?

I mean, can‚Äôt we just pay and get the product without all this hassle?

1g7tg22,https://i.redd.it/kvipbva67vvd1.jpeg,Can you include a tagline or slogan in my brand intro?,"Tagline Tango: The Dance of Brand Identity!""

Paragraph 1: ‚ÄúThe Power of Words‚Äù

You ever notice how a good tagline can be like a perfect pickup line? ‚ÄúAre you a magician? Because whenever I look at your brand, everyone else disappears!‚Äù Now, wouldn‚Äôt that be a great way to introduce your business? A tagline has the power to make your brand unforgettable‚Äîlike that embarrassing dance move you did at your cousin‚Äôs wedding. It sticks with people!

Paragraph 2: ‚ÄúWhy a Tagline?‚Äù

But seriously, why should you include a tagline in your brand intro? Think of it as the cherry on top of your branding sundae. It‚Äôs not just about looking pretty; it‚Äôs about conveying your brand‚Äôs essence in a few snappy words. ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to run a marathon, or at least jog to the fridge.‚Äù It communicates everything and nothing all at once, and that‚Äôs the beauty of it!

Paragraph 3: ‚ÄúCrafting the Perfect Tagline‚Äù

Now, how do you craft that perfect tagline? It‚Äôs like dating! You want something that captures attention but also reflects your true self. So, if you‚Äôre a tech company, saying ‚ÄúWe make your dreams come true!‚Äù is a little much. Maybe try, ‚ÄúWe make your devices less confusing.‚Äù It‚Äôs relatable, honest, and no one is left wondering if they need a fairy godmother!

Paragraph 4: ‚ÄúKeep It Short and Sweet‚Äù

And let‚Äôs talk length! A tagline should be like a good joke: short and sweet. If it‚Äôs longer than a TikTok video, you‚Äôve lost your audience. No one wants to read a paragraph when all they really want is a snack! Think of it as a tweet, but for your brand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the best in the biz‚Äù is solid, but ‚ÄúWe make business easy‚Äù packs a punch and leaves them wanting more!

Paragraph 5: ‚ÄúTesting the Waters‚Äù

Once you‚Äôve got a tagline, test it out! Share it with your friends, family, or that one colleague who critiques your lunch choices. If they don‚Äôt laugh, roll their eyes, or at least say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not terrible,‚Äù it‚Äôs back to the drawing board! Remember, a tagline should evoke a reaction. If it doesn‚Äôt make people smile, it‚Äôs time to dig deeper!

Paragraph 6: ‚ÄúTagline Real Estate‚Äù

Now, where do you put this tagline? It‚Äôs prime real estate, folks! It belongs right next to your brand intro‚Äîlike peanut butter and jelly. Slap it on your website, social media, and all your marketing materials. Just don‚Äôt go crazy‚Äîputting it on your coffee mug and socks might be a bit much. Let‚Äôs not scare off potential customers!

Conclusion: ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts‚Äù

So, can you include a tagline or slogan in your brand intro? Absolutely! Just remember, it‚Äôs not just a tagline; it‚Äôs your brand‚Äôs voice. Craft it wisely, test it out, and let it dance its way into the hearts of your audience. And if all else fails, just remember: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a businessman, I‚Äôm a business, man!‚Äù Now that‚Äôs a tagline for you!

‚Ü≥Rintaro is a quiet person who collects a lot of knowledge in order to get ahead in life more easily. Because he has a lot of knowledge, he is often treated differently by those around him or even taken advantage of, which he is aware of. Rintaro is also a person who likes to be alone and can concentrate better that way, but it helps him better when he has people around him who are important to him so he can concentrate and relax even better. Rintaro's knowledge is something that he sometimes values too much because he often talks too much about his knowledge and sometimes comes across as arrogant, which he doesn't mean because he simply wants to share his knowledge. 

üíÆ‚ä±‡ºªLikes‡º∫‚ä∞üíÆ

‚Ü≥Rintaro is a good listener because he rarely speaks. He also learns quickly because he learned a lot of new things as a child and he has a lot of general knowledge, but he is also very knowledgeable in a few categories. 

üíÆ‚ä±‡ºªweakness ‡º∫‚ä∞üíÆ
‚Ü≥Rintaro sometimes finds it difficult to express his feelings properly because he doesn't talk much. He also sometimes neglects the people around him because he is sometimes only focused on himself.

1g7tcni,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1g7tcni/mobile_number_asked_in_literally_every_shops/,Mobile Number asked in literally every shops,"

Is it only me, or is anyone else tired of being asked for their mobile number at every turn? Whether I‚Äôm buying a cup of tea or clothes at the mall, everyone seems to need my number.

I‚Äôm already bombarded with spam calls and texts. How can we be sure that businesses are asking for our numbers for their promotions and not just to sell our data?

Here are some scenarios I‚Äôve faced:

1. When I rejected giving my number, a staff argued that they couldn‚Äôt provide a bill without a valid number. When I suggested entering a random number, they said they couldn‚Äôt do that because they verify with an OTP. I had no choice but to cancel the purchase.
2. In another shop, they needed to get the bill from a self-help kiosk instead billing from the counter. However, the while redirecting, the sales guy sarcastically asked, ""Won't you give your mobile number if it's a bank?"" Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt at a bank; I was buying clothes.
3. The last time I was at a phone store, they opened the new phone box even before I made the purchase. When I got to the billing counter and refused to give my mobile number, they pressured me into providing it. In the end, they used their own alternate number. When they handed over the bill, they mentioned that the warranty couldn‚Äôt be claimed since I hadn‚Äôt provided my mobile number. I believe the warranty should be linked to the product and the bill, not my mobile number. As I was leaving, another guy who didn‚Äôt know what had happened asked me to fill out a form for their lucky draw, which again I politely refused.¬†
4. Most of the new age coffee/tea outlets ask for mobile number for billing. When asked is there any discounts.. they don't know. Then why?

I mean, can‚Äôt we just pay and get the product without all this hassle?

i heard that central asia countries have no roaches is that true?   
i believe it because in mountains there are many predators for them and it's colder there.

At age 23, after some even more unfortunate circumstances and hospitalizations, a Bipolar I diagnosis replaced the MDD. I have always suspected my mother, who was not a part of my life from ages 14-23 ironically enough, and my paternal grandmother both also have Bipolar.

At ages 25-26 (last year) I missed my thesis and graduation deadlines following MORE unfortunate circumstances. I brought up attention and focusing struggles with my psychiatrist, sobbing about how it was ruining my life because Ive spent so much time and money on this Masters program and it was too late to quit now. I did NOT want to be homeless again and student loans + grad stipend were the only things keeping me afloat. It got so bad that Id tape myself to my desk at the PC to type, withholding food until a certain number of pages were done, picked up a coffee habbit to help me stay awake but it never worked. Id leave my home and sit at the student union for 12 hours every day to avoid being too comfy and to minimize my bathroom breaks bc that meant walking away from my stuff in public or having to pack up my whole setup for 30 mins-1 hour (I have Crohns), but I started having accidents.

How do I forget about him?","Hello! First time using this so apologies if I'm not used to the normal etiquette and stuff, let me know if there are any questions. Apologies, there's a lot of context!


I've been depressed for the last few months over an experience I had in March with a guy. For some context, I've not really had a very good experience with relationships at all throughout my life, usually I just got ghosted or only contacted if the person wants to have sex, which doesn't feel great.
I have / had an online friend that I've known for a few years, we met on a niche interest dating site and ended up adding each other on discord and chatting for a while. I really really liked him, since I thought he was both super hot and we shared a lot of the same interests which is rare for me. I'm quite picky. Our conversations actually started out somewhat sexual and flirty, and it's weird looking back on them now with the context that he's apparently straight. At the time he said he was bi and said he found both men and women hot, but mostly women. 


Regardless, we'd been chatting for a while but eventually the conversations became a little more passive from his side, sending 1 word responses and not really communicating much. Now, something to keep in mind is that I live in the UK and he lives in the US, so a relationship was basically never going to be feasible, and I understood this at the time. However in march I was visiting the US, near where he lives, so I told him that I'd be happy to meet him for a coffee if he wanted. He agreed, and told me I could stay at his place because he had a spare room. By this point all the sexual conversations had stopped, and I just assumed we were friends, so I knew nothing was going to happen. I still really liked him though, since again online I don't really have anyone to speak to that has the exact same nerdy interests I'm into.


We eventually meet and he's a little awkward but it's fine, again, under the assumption that we're just friends, I go to his place, play videogames, watch a movie with him, he tells me about the quaint little rural town he lives in, and bizarrely offloads onto me about how he got fired from his last job/issues he has with other people that live in the town that hate him for ""no reason"", and how he lives like a bit of a hermit now because he's looking for a job. I kind of knew already that he didn't tend to do much outside of his house, but in a stupid self righteous way I wanted to help him, I always said I'd help him look for jobs and help him with his CV and stuff if he wants. 


Anyway, some time passes and I'm at his place playing a videogame and he leaves the room briefly, only to come back in shirtless and flirty, telling me something along the lines of ""I feel bad if you come all this way and we don't get to do anything"", I go to his bedroom with him and we start to cuddle and kiss and stuff, and eventually he tells me he's getting turned on. I start having sex with him, but I'm not very experienced so I need to be guided a lot, this goes on for a while, and he's kind of not really turned on anymore, and he asks me if he can watch porn while I'm helping him out. Stupidly, I say yes, and then I eventually pull off him a few minutes later because I feel like I'm not getting anywhere and basically let him finish himself off. By this point I'm already feeling humiliated, and he makes an off comment about how ""it's fine, I know youre asexual"", which, I'm not, I have no idea where he got this idea from. After that I go to the spare room and basically struggle to sleep for the rest of the night. I end up sort of doing my own thing for the next day after that, since he doesn't really want to leave the house much after that point, until I eventually head home.
Now, at that point I just thought of all that as a random awkward encounter, still speaking to him on text here and there. But months later I feel absolutely mortified that all that happened, what makes it worse is that, months later, all his social media profiles have changed to say he's just straight now, and he'll make posts insisting he's never had feelings for men. We still speak on occasion, but it's usually me pestering him with memes and stuff that he barely responds to. 


About a month ago I blocked him because it hurts me to even message him, and it just felt super unrequited. I added him back eventually and he seemed confused why I blocked him in the first place, so I just came out and said I had feelings for him and it kind of hurt me that he seemed so indifferent towards me, and I asked for some sort of clarity on where we even standing at this point. He barely even responded to that confession, basically sending a meme back and being like ""idk lol were just friends"". I didn't know what to say after that.


Now, in the present, I'm just constantly thinking about him and I really don't want to because it hurts me so much, I dont even think I'm in love with him, since my brain seems to have finally caught up and seen all the red flags he's shown over the years I've known him, but it's more because I've never felt so humiliated. It's the fact that I was absolutely ready to catch up with him like a friend would, then we had sex, only for him to start watching porn mid sex, and now he's set his dating stuff to straight. It makes me feel as if I made him realise he was never bi which feels absolutely awful. I understand that people need to experiment sometimes, but it does NOT feel good to feel like you're the reason that someone realised they don't like men. Something else to consider is that even before we met I'd always asked him if he'd been with guys before and he said he had, since I was worried something like this might happen.


I guess the advice I'm looking for is what can I do to forget about him? My original plan was blocking him but I ended up going back on myself for that. I really want to stop thinking about him because I feel like an obsessive psycho and it's interfering with my work by how depressed it's making me.  I wish I could do some sort of eternal sunshine thing and just remove him from my brain.",1,1729409127.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1g7szx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g7szx8/3rd_date_initiate_physical_contact/,"3rd Date, initiate physical contact","Hi,

About two weeks ago I meet a girl (21F) in college and asked her if she wanted to go out for coffee (i, 21M, am quite timid towards girls and never asked anyone out, but knew that I would regret for a long time if I did not.

We went last weekend on our first date, it was great (coffee and walking for almost 4 hours) and had our second date last friday (where we went to a museum and for a walk again afterwards). We have agreed to meet for another date, but no day has been decided upon. 

Even though at the beginning of both dates we had a bot of difficulty to find topics to talk about, both times after about 30 minutes we were both just talking with no end in sight. Since our dates (and also in between) we text almost daily, mostly about the daily events (we are both initiating the texting).

I think I like her a lot and don‚Äòt want to mess it up. Except a bye hug, we had no physical contact at all. Is going for a kiss on the third date stupid (of course only if it seems to be the right moment)? Or holding hands when walking?

Furthermore I would like to cook for her in the evening, do you think it is too early for that for a 3rd or 4th date, as it may convey a wrong message (i.e. I want more physically)?

Thanks for your help, much appreciated!",1,1729407707.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1g7svfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1g7svfv/izuku_does_have_a_quirkbut_hes_embarrassed_to_use/,Izuku does have a quirk...but he's embarrassed to use it,"Izuku was born with a quirk, rather it is a transformation type quirk inherited from his father Hisashi Midoriya.

His quirk allows him to change into a fairly tall and somewhat muscular anthropomorphic lizard that appears to be a mixture of several reptiles, mainly a sarcosuchus, a deinosuchus, a komodo dragon can shoot acid from its mouth and manipulate it. The strange thing about this quirk is that they are as if they were two people in one but sharing consciousness at the same time

Izuku doesn't use it because one day he converted and appeared naked in class to the point that several girls proposed dates to him.

-that's good, look at the positive side

-MOM YOU DON'T HELP ME

-hey you're right

-DAD YOU NEITHER

The Quirk also has the passive ability to let Izuku become invisible until he is hit.

Hisashi works as a professional hero as ""THE SHAPE-SHIFTING HERO: RAPTORILE""

He's not a bad father since he raised Izuku more than Inko...he took him to work...don't ask how that ended, we'll just say that one day baby Izuku cried so hard that he left a villain deaf for life.

Bakugou did not treat Izuku badly although he was very afraid of his ""uncle Hisashi"" more than anything because Mitsuki (being a bit nosy) told the story of Hisashi's life since he was a thief and even a hitman for hire, he didn't kill anyone but if he gave severe enough beatings making anyone difficult to recognize or requiring surgeries

Izuku did get One For All, although due to the strange functioning of his OFA quirk it does not give him the side effect of dying over time, only that if he combines them he can deactivate them...or sometimes he is so weak that an ant is capable of humiliating him

Hisashi was disappointed when he saw that Izuku was more inspired by All Might than by his own father.

-how are you?

-oh well HI-sashi

-Did you try the coffee?

-Yes and it was delicious, what did it have?

-a laxative...don't thank me, your stomach will thank me

-wait when it takes effect?

-3...2...and 1

Hisashi can transform into a lizard like Izuku but a thousand or even millions of times stronger and more dangerous, combine it with the breath of fire

(Hisashi's suit is like Reptile's from Mortal Kombat 1)

Hisashi's style is quite brutal since he aims at the weak points and psychologically humiliates the rival. This he did against AFO in Kamino since after saving Izuku and his companions he went at high speed against AFO and grabbed him by the neck making him bleed. to later throw him to the ground and fire at point-blank range against AFO

-what's happening? demon king? do you feel humiliated?

-you did...you did...you did CHEAT CHEAT DISGUSTING CHEAT DIRTY AND DISGUSTING CHEAT

This was the cornerstone for Tomura to begin to doubt his ""master"" since Hisashi triggered AFO's childish side and even All Might felt uncomfortable with his archenemy.

Izuku uses the transformation part of his quirk, although sometimes since he does not like his father's treacherous and even humiliating style, although they do not get along, they only argue when it is talked about.

-Inko, why did you choose the one who went to high school with us and came from a poor family?

-Oh Mitsuki Hisashi is a good guy

-ONE DAY HE ARRIVED WITH AN ELECTRIC ANKLET

-age things I guess

-HE TURNED ON A 10 FEET REPTILOID AND SENT A CLASSMATE TO HOSPITAL

-It's great that you reminded me, he looked so cool...I mean...things that happen Mitsuki

-you are strange you and your weird fetish

Izuku did use his father's fighting style against Chisaki and humiliated him up to 100 times more than in the canon.

Describing Higher Beings are of a different kind.","Aliens lately are called Spiritual, multidimensional, timeless and spaceless. Please think about this words. They describe entities that only partially exist or penetrate our reality. Keep in mind their ‚Äúother part‚Äù is in realm unimaginable to us. Like an iceberg underwater.

¬†¬† How is that possible? Thought experiment: Downscale our 3D world to 2D as if we are people on a flat sheet of paper, and higher dimension, represented by a cube can go through our flat world and at every moment of time there would be only a single ‚Äúslice‚Äù of a cube inside the sheet of paper fabric.

[Our \\""flat\\"" world-reality is a blue sheet inside. And the 3D cube here resembles the \\""body\\"" of \\""aliens\\"" that penetrate our reality as they wish\/can and creat this simulation. ](https://preview.redd.it/pyxzwc7axuvd1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c654b282daefc5682a698737795d4b14d53e7b8)

But that‚Äôs not exactly it! Aliens are not material higher dimensional cubes. They are something ‚Äú3D‚Äù that feels in our imaginable ‚Äú2D‚Äù world as narratives, events, stories only when it ""goes"" through us in a certain manner!¬†

Do you get it? This is very hard to grasp but please try. Any Events visible by us ARE this penetration. Event types like walking to school or drinking coffee, browsing reddit - it is something you can imagine and something you can put as a goal and live through your life toward it. So the event like ‚Äúdrink coffee‚Äù is timeless and spaceless itself, fundamental as math. It happened to many people before you and will happen again. And for aliens that is one single moment and place!

**‚ÄúDrinking coffee‚Äù and all that leads to and from it is a single case that is a ‚Äúbody structure part‚Äù of an alien in our reality. Same as all other ever existed in past and existing in future TYPES of narratives and events.**

You have the illusion that you run your body. It is run by some aliens from higher realms that propagate through your consciousness that consist of narratives created and detected in time. It's probably true because neither you nor I understand for 100% what we live for, what is the goal? You live and understand reality only because you follow some ideas and goals. And their fundamental meanings are a mystery to us.

It is obvious as bees that don't see beekeeper but suspect he exists.

* ~20g ground coffee in moka pot to yield a brew of 90 to 100ml (grind size 3 on JEI manual grinder)

* 150ml hot water in base

* 150ml hot milk

* 10g jaggery powder (sweet) / 5g jaggery powder (midly sweet) / 0g jaggery powder (no sweet)

I either mix the jaggery in hot milk and pour the brewed coffee over it or create an espuma (https://youtu.be/gkNSTxPZDvg), pour brewed coffee followed by hot milk. Any tips would be appreciated. TIA!

The houses that we're seeing are mainly properties that have been lived in by someone who hasn't updated it in over 30 years so would require a lot of work. We have a 1 year old so the idea of living in a construction site with exploring hands fills is with dread. Are there any areas that we should be considering that might be more affordable?

A bit about us: we would like a 3 bed home with a garden ideally. We spend a lot of time in Reigate and love the small town vibe that offers (with good independent coffee shops/pubs, a decent park and lots to do for young families). I work in London so need to be close enough to a commuting train station. My husband works from home so we're trying to get a decent garden where he can have an outdoor office in time. My parents and our friends mainly live locally. My husbands family live along the south coast so a bit further out.

1g7spcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g7spcn/feeling_extremely_pathetic_and_worthless_due_to/,Feeling extremely pathetic and worthless due to an encounter I had with a guy this year,"Hello! First time using this so apologies if I'm not used to the normal etiquette and stuff, let me know if there are any questions. Apologies, there's a lot of context!


I've been depressed for the last few months over an experience I had in March with a guy. For some context, I've not really had a very good experience with relationships at all throughout my life, usually I just got ghosted or only contacted if the person wants to have sex, which doesn't feel great. Also for further context I'm 26m and he's 31m.
I have / had an online friend that I've known for a few years, we met on a niche interest dating site and ended up adding each other on discord and chatting for a while. I really really liked him, since I thought he was both super hot and we shared a lot of the same interests which is rare for me. I'm quite picky. Our conversations actually started out somewhat sexual and flirty, and it's weird looking back on them now with the context that he's apparently straight. At the time he said he was bi and said he found both men and women hot, but mostly women. 


Regardless, we'd been chatting for a while but eventually the conversations became a little more passive from his side, sending 1 word responses and not really communicating much. Now, something to keep in mind is that I live in the UK and he lives in the US, so a relationship was basically never going to be feasible, and I understood this at the time. However in march I was visiting the US, near where he lives, so I told him that I'd be happy to meet him for a coffee if he wanted. He agreed, and told me I could stay at his place because he had a spare room. By this point all the sexual conversations had stopped, and I just assumed we were friends, so I knew nothing was going to happen. I still really liked him though, since again online I don't really have anyone to speak to that has the exact same nerdy interests I'm into.


We eventually meet and he's a little awkward but it's fine, again, under the assumption that we're just friends, I go to his place, play videogames, watch a movie with him, he tells me about the quaint little rural town he lives in, and bizarrely offloads onto me about how he got fired from his last job/issues he has with other people that live in the town that hate him for ""no reason"", and how he lives like a bit of a hermit now because he's looking for a job. I kind of knew already that he didn't tend to do much outside of his house, but in a stupid self righteous way I wanted to help him, I always said I'd help him look for jobs and help him with his CV and stuff if he wants. 


Anyway, some time passes and I'm at his place playing a videogame and he leaves the room briefly, only to come back in shirtless and flirty, telling me something along the lines of ""I feel bad if you come all this way and we don't get to do anything"", I go to his bedroom with him and we start to cuddle and kiss and stuff, and eventually he tells me he's getting turned on. I start having sex with him, but I'm not very experienced so I need to be guided a lot, this goes on for a while, and he's kind of not really turned on anymore, and he asks me if he can watch porn while I'm helping him out. Stupidly, I say yes, and then I eventually pull off him a few minutes later because I feel like I'm not getting anywhere and basically let him finish himself off. By this point I'm already feeling humiliated, and he makes an off comment about how ""it's fine, I know youre asexual"", which, I'm not, I have no idea where he got this idea from. After that I go to the spare room and basically struggle to sleep for the rest of the night. I end up sort of doing my own thing for the next day after that, since he doesn't really want to leave the house much after that point, until I eventually head home.
Now, at that point I just thought of all that as a random awkward encounter, still speaking to him on text here and there. But months later I feel absolutely mortified that all that happened, what makes it worse is that, months later, all his social media profiles have changed to say he's just straight now, and he'll make posts insisting he's never had feelings for men. We still speak on occasion, but it's usually me pestering him with memes and stuff that he barely responds to. 


About a month ago I blocked him because it hurts me to even message him, and it just felt super unrequited. I added him back eventually and he seemed confused why I blocked him in the first place, so I just came out and said I had feelings for him and it kind of hurt me that he seemed so indifferent towards me, and I asked for some sort of clarity on where we even standing at this point. He barely even responded to that confession, basically sending a meme back and being like ""idk lol were just friends"". I didn't know what to say after that.


Now, in the present, I'm just constantly thinking about him and I really don't want to because it hurts me so much, I dont even think I'm in love with him, since my brain seems to have finally caught up and seen all the red flags he's shown over the years I've known him, but it's more because I've never felt so humiliated. It's the fact that I was absolutely ready to catch up with him like a friend would, then we had sex, only for him to start watching porn mid sex, and now he's set his dating stuff to straight. It makes me feel as if I made him realise he was never bi which feels absolutely awful. I understand that people need to experiment sometimes, but it does NOT feel good to feel like you're the reason that someone realised they don't like men. Something else to consider is that even before we met I'd always asked him if he'd been with guys before and he said he had, since I was worried something like this might happen.


I guess the advice I'm looking for is what can I do to forget about him? My original plan was blocking him but I ended up going back on myself for that. I really want to stop thinking about him because I feel like an obsessive psycho and it's interfering with my work by how depressed it's making me.  I wish I could do some sort of eternal sunshine thing and just remove him from my brain.",1,1729406484.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Employers are struggling to fill positions as universities simply can't churn engineers out fast enough to meet the demand. 

Two more universities are reporting record enrollment in the Fall of 2024 semester: The University of Illinois, Chicago Campus, along with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln! 

The Unversity of Nebraska is reporting a 9.1% increase in the enrollment of engineering students over 2023's numbers, and leading the charge is a 22.5% increase in the number of students enrolled in Mechanical Engineering!

How do I approach this situation?","This morning we had 2 friends coming over at 9:30am for coffee. The apartment was messy. His schoolwork was all over the table, dirty dishes in the sink, dish rack was full of clean dishes from me doing a mountain of dishes from the day before, crap in the living room. Anyways, I got up at 9am and started tidying up. I asked him once to help me tidy up, he said okay but kept scrolling on his phone. 9:15am rolls around, I asked him again to please get up and help because I wanted it to be tidy before our friends get here. He didn't move. Just kept scrolling. I start to get irritated. 9:28am rolls around. I said ""please help me, they are going to be here any minute."" He said ""they aren't going to be here right at 9:30am."" I said ""they usually are on time, I need your help to tidy up because everything is messy.""

This is the ""ick"" part. He started to act like a fucking baby. He rolled his eyes very hard. Made a bunch of annoyed and irritated faces and sounds (sighing). Whipped the blankets off angrily and said ""god, I'm trying to relax."" And then our friends knocked on the door 2 seconds later RIGHT at 9:30am. I said ""what is your deal? I asked for help cleaning, I told you they would be here at 9:30am and I've been asking you for help since 9."" He was still in his boxers so he had to get changed. Our friends came in, 10 minutes goes by, they ask where he is and I said he was changing but I go into the bedroom and he's lying in bed scrolling on his phone and I asked if he's coming and he said ""I'll be out soon."" I was pissed at this point. He was being useless, acting shitty, and then showed no interest in coming into the living room.

He has never acted like this before. I've been pissed all day at how he acted. He hasn't trying speaking to me or apologized to me. We had a 2 hour drive tonight to visit his family from out of town and we didn't talk the whole way. 

Also, when we first woke up, things were totally fine. We snuggled. Chatted. And then I got up to clean. It wasn't until I asked for help that he got annoyed and acted like that.

There's a Bo's coffee here and i remembered na may ""hand pour or french press"" selections sila altho di ko pa na try before so i thought why not?

pag order ko natagalan kaming nag usap ng barista kasi frenchpress lang daw yan and di nila alam ang ""pourover"" kahit sabi ko same thing lang yan sa handpour.

So we compromised nalang and ended up having an iced americano with their handpour/pourover selection beans. their usual americano kasi is usually a barista blend or sumn and paid the 'handpour' price since ofcourse single origin beans naman

There was a recent post about ""how cheap have you seen the bambino plus?"" and so i thought i would mention that right now you can get a refurbished Bambino for $296.65 (Free shipping), or Bambino Plus for $381.65 (Free shipping) from the official Breville eBay account if you use the code ""OCTSAV15"" (which i assume expires after October).

In the end I actually went for an unofficially refurbished Breville Dual Boiler for $605 delivered from a site called ""Spare Parts For Coffee Machines"".
