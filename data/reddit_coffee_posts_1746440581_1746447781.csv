So to set the scene, at the time I was 14 and it was a couple of days before my 15th birthday. I was staying the night at my older cousins house where I stayed awake all night talking to this random boy I met on snapchat. We shared our traumas and experiences and we really bonded. As cringey as it sounds, even though we had only started speaking that night, it felt like we had known each other for years. After finding out we live kind of close to each other, we decided to meet up. I still remember how it went to this day. I had a maths mock exam at the end of the day and we were supposed to meet up at the library. I brought my best friend with me at the time because I was scared to go alone. Once I entered the library I saw him sitting on a chair in the corner of the library reading a book. I just got so nervous as soon as I saw him I walked back out, but he must have seen me walk out because he came outside too. He was in his schools cricket uniform. We spoke for a little while and then decided to go back into the library, where he asked me to sit on his lap. We spoke a little bit more and we went to the libraries bathroom. This was my first time ever doing anything. Just for a heads up this wasn’t SA, I did kind of want to do it. Anyways I gave him (well attempted to) a you know what job. I kept using my teeth and I could just tell I wasn’t doing a good job. After that, he tried to put it in me but it hurt so badly I said no, and I could tell he was like not mad mad but annoyed, we tried again but it hurt too much. After all of that obviously some of my makeup came off, revealing some of my acne scars… it cringes me to say it but in front of my bsf he started giving me homemade remedies to put on my face to help me? Like I was 14 and it was hormonal ??? How would putting coffee grounds on my face help, not to mention it was infront of her I was so embarrassed. After that day, he didn’t respond to me for a while. Eventually, when he did, he told me he didn’t want to talk anymore and basically ghosted me after all of that. To make things worse. It was my birthday the next day. I basically gave up my innocence and I wish I didn’t. I try my best to repress this memory and I haven’t thought about it since, up until this moment im writing it. I’ve never told anyone about this in detail except for my best friend at the time who didn’t know the whole story. I swear i regret it so much.",1,1746447697.0,Regrets,0,1.0,False

I was dating one of the owners for 18 months. Many times he would bag his coffee in my kitchen the night before market. Sometimes a bag would spill, he’d sweep it up off the floor, pick the dog hair out, blow off the dust and floor schmutz, and put it right back into a bag for sale. 

He won’t be packing coffee in my kitchen anymore, as I found out yesterday that he was cheating on me the whole time, or rather cheating on someone else *with me* the whole time. I thought he was the love of my life. I had never met someone so kind or caring or trustworthy, but apparently it’s all an act, and he’s *very* good at it. 

I’m sure some other unsuspecting girl will let him use her kitchen soon enough, if he doesn’t already have a third girl in the mix. Maybe her kitchen floor will be cleaner than mine. Otherwise he’ll be packing coffee in his own kitchen, conditions for which can only be described as squalid. So, drink at your own risk.",5,1746447451.0,bullcity,3,0.78,False

Doon sa kwarto, may sofa and doon ako pansamantalang pinaupo saglit kasi inaayos ng parents ko kung kama. Then they gave me this new released samsung phone na keypad at may camera to keep me busy. 

Ako na batang nawili sa bagong gadget, syempre naglaro ako. Pero naintriga talaga ako sa camera so yun yung pinagtripan ko.

Sa harapan ko is nandoon yung coffee table, doon nakapatong yung nag-iisang kandila na nagsisilbing ilaw sa kwarto. I took many pictures of it in many angles. Nung naayos na yung kama, kinuha na sakin yung phone and pinatulog na ako. 

Kinabukasan, lola went to check the phone. Yeh, di pa uso password non kaya kung sino-sino lang nakakabukas hahaha. Anyway, nung una si mama yung tinawag niya. ""Tignan mo nga 'to,"" she said sabay pakita ng screen.

Itong si mama, nagulat. Pero for some reason, nginitian niya ako nung humarap sa akin sabay sabing, ""nak, tignan mo yung napicturan mo.""

So ako, na-excite ako thinking na yung kandila yon. Well, yung kandila nga. Only, may sumama. Doon sa right corner ng pic is kita yung bintana namin. May reddish glow coming from the outside and what creeped me out the most is may mukhang nakangiti.

""Wag ka nang maglalaro ng camera sa gabi,"" bilin ni lola sakin. 

Si mama naman hindi ko maintindihan. Ginawa niya pa talagang wallpaper yon para lang hindi ko na pakialaman yung phone niya.

Till this day, that image scares me. Pero hindi na siya nag-eexist kasi nanakaw yung phone na yon sa jeep, lol.

Pero what if may akyat bahay lang pala noon tapos na-timing? Or what if glare lang yon ng camera? Pero kasi, old cam siya eh. And we know that old cameras got the creepiest shots.",1,1746447420.0,phhorrorstories,0,1.0,False

I’m not even a barista; just someone who loves drinking coffee from Starbucks and wants to try making it at home. Any tips on the espresso, milk, or other ingredients they use would be really appreciated.

My partner and I have been together for 11 years. We got pregnant the first year due to a lot of sex. Then our next child arrived 2 years later for the same reason. 

Since then, our sex life has rapidly taken a turn for the worse. I can count on 2 hands the number of times we have had sex during the past 2 years. The last time was what we call ""duty sex"". That was 2 months ago and I have since stopped initiating.

My partner gained a little weight during the last pregnancy, but lost it within a year and she's fit and damn sexy. I too are working out and taking care of myself. At home we split the chores fairly. We usually clean the house together, laundry is evenly split, I'm the main cook and we are both active in taking care of our children. I also do most of the maintenance on our car and home while she tends to the garden (I chip in here too because I enjoy it and I like spending time outside with her). 

We do all of the normal stuff every day together: we go on daily hikes with or without the kids to let our dog get its exercise. We watch shows together, listen to and discuss music and read books with coffee on the side. On the surface, everything is damn perfect. In the bedroom: nothing. And if it happens, it isn't passionate. I'm longing for any physical touch, love or passion. Just the need to feel like she looks at me and think I'm good looking...

We went to therapy about a year ago. This therapist specialized in couples and intimacy/sex. Things started blooming again. My partner told me to buy some sexy lingerie for her that I would like to see her in. I bought very sexy lingerie that was also modest and a sexy night gown. Both of these items were modest enough that she could use them around the kids as well. This was 9 months ago and she haven't used either of those yet... After the first few months of therapy she started initiating and we had sex a few times the first month (which was a huge improvement). 

She told me that she loved me and wanted me and that she wanted to work on this. We'll. For the past 7 months it has dwindled back to nothing. 

I feel like an utter fool. You guys told me two years ago to leave. I should have listened. 

Thanks for reading this. I just needed to get it off my chest. Advice welcome if anyone wants to chip in. ",5,1746446932.0,DeadBedrooms,0,0.86,False
1kfa02d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kfa02d/find_out_if_the_nobl_travel_zipperless_suitcase/,Find Out if the Nobl Travel Zipperless Suitcase Truly Delivers in This Review,"The **Nobl CO1122 Travel Zipperless Carry On Suitcase**, a compact yet feature-packed piece of travel gear, has me rethinking the concept of carry-on luggage. As someone who constantly juggles between business trips and family getaways, I’ve had my fair share of luggage heartbreaks. But this little beast of innovation surprised me. With its emphasis on durability, convenience, and tech-forward additions, it caters to a variety of travel needs. Of course, no product is perfect, and I’ll get into that below. Let’s take a closer look at what makes this product an excellent companion—and where it falters.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right off the bat, the suitcase flaunts its modern design. The sleek polycarbonate shell combined with a sturdy aluminum frame gives it an attractive, futuristic appearance. While the zipperless design feels innovative, it also provides a sense of security with dual TSA-approved locks. I didn’t have to worry about someone trying to force open the bag. Its reinforced structure had me impressed, steadily surviving a flight that involved one too many baggage mishandling incidents—thank you, airport staff.

This compact yet solid design comes in at 15.5 x 10 x 22 inches, and despite being lightweight, the suitcase feels durable enough to take on regular extensive use. I’d add that the green color option is a breath of fresh air compared to the usual black crowd, so spotting it amongst a sea of luggage was a breeze!

**Smart Travel Features**

What truly elevates this carry-on is its smart inclusion of modern travel amenities. The USB and USB-C charging port is a blessing during layovers or long waits. I travel with a lot of gadgets, and being able to charge my phone directly from my suitcase is wildly convenient. Plus, the handle integrates a phone mount, which I didn’t realize I desperately needed until I used it. Working or binge-watching at the airport, hands-free, felt like luxury travel.

The hidden cup holder is pure genius for someone like me, who's always rushing between gates with a coffee in hand. Those clever touches are complemented by sturdy, smooth-rolling 360° spinner wheels and an adjustable, four-level telescopic handle. These made navigating crowded terminals feel effortless.

**Storage and Organization**

Despite its sleek profile, the storage features inside this suitcase appear thoughtfully designed. The front laptop compartment allows quick access, which is especially useful when going through security. Meanwhile, the main compartment holds up to 35 liters and includes a mesh pocket, wet pocket, and X-straps to secure your clothes and toiletries.

That being said, the combo of its compact frame and additional compartments for tech-friendly travelers comes at a small cost. Packing for a week’s trip? You might struggle to fit more than two days' worth of clothing, as I discovered. It's perfect for weekend getaways or short business trips but certainly not for marathon vacations.

**Upsides**

Some standout merits of this carry-on include:  
- Durable polycarbonate shell with reinforced aluminum frame.  
- Integrated USB and USB-C charging ports for devices.  
- Hidden cup holder for convenient beverage storage.  
- Smooth, quiet 360° spinner wheels.  
- TSA-approved locks for added security.  

**Critiques**

That said, there are a few less favorable aspects I encountered:  
- The overall storage capacity feels limited for longer trips.  
- Exterior dimension discrepancies with airlines can complicate carry-on approval.  
- Missing assembly or product instructions, especially for the front compartment, was frustrating at first.  

**Market Rivals**

Compared to top-performing brands like Samsonite or Away, this suitcase carves its own niche. Samsonite options like the Omni PC carry-on prioritize interior volume over tech features, which makes it better for longer trips but less convenient for gadget fans like me. Away’s suitcases, while stylish, lack certain pragmatic add-ons like built-in charging and a cup holder, putting it a notch below the Nobl suitcase for tech-savvy users.

Nevertheless, the Nobl CO1122 suitcase struggles to beat rivals like Travelpro Platinum Elite in overall storage space. The Travelpro, with its soft-shell design, offers noticeably more flexibility when packing bulky items—something I missed while using the Nobl.

**Money's Worth**

The price-performance ratio of this suitcase feels pretty balanced for traveler types who value design, security, and tech integration. However, if all you’re looking for is maximum capacity, this model might leave you wanting more. Its premium features justify the investment, but the limited space and airline compatibility critiques are considerations. Honestly, for short hauls or tech-centric travelers, it’s still worth adding to your list of options.

Hi everyone! I’m 28F and have been diagnosed with ADHD, complex PTSD, and depression for about 3 years now. But even before I had those diagnoses — and before I got access to meds — I can now see that I was constantly chasing dopamine in all kinds of ways. Unconsciously, but intensely.

Right now, I’m unemployed (a whole another ADHD story of its own), and I recently noticed I was getting completely hooked on Instagram reels. That made me reflect on all the other addictions I’ve had over the years, and HOW INCREDIBLY EASY it is for us to get hooked on things that offer quick dopamine.

* **Early signs: sugar and soda** As a toddler, I was addicted to candy. I would throw full-blown tantrums when I couldn’t have it — not the usual “I want candy” kind of thing, but a deep craving that felt like something was tearing through my chest. Then around age 10, I became obsessed with Coca-Cola. I was drinking two liters a day and even started stealing bottles. I’d lie to my parents constantly, saying “this is my first glass today” when I’d already had more than a liter. It got so bad I started having regular stomach pain. I quit soda completely at 15 — and I’ve stayed clean since.
* **Teen years: coffee and weed** At 17, coffee became my best friend. I was drinking up to 5 cups a day, and honestly… still kind of struggling with that (heh). Then, at 18, I tried weed for the first time — and I really regret it. I fell into daily use almost immediately. Wake and bake, smoking all day, every day. I’m now **7 days sober**, and while that might not sound like much, it’s honestly killing me. After nearly 10 years of smoking 24/7, I have no idea who I am without it. That’s terrifying.
* **Screens and survival mode** Just a few days ago, I realized I was also addicted to Instagram reels, LMAO. I uninstalled the app today, and while I’ve migrated to Reddit (lol), at least here I’m reading and engaging — it feels a little more real.

Because I’m currently unemployed, I haven’t been able to afford my meds, and that makes everything harder. The cravings, the boredom, the spiral (AAAHH!!!). I keep reaching for weed or screen time just to *feel something* or to escape.

But now I honestly just feel stuck. I’m trying to be gentle with myself and celebrate every sober day, but OH GOD IT'S HARD! 

I wanted to ask… has anyone else gone through something similar? that feeling of chasing dopamine through anything (food, weed, screens, whatever) and then trying to stop and not knowing who you are without it?

If you’ve been there… how did you cope? how do you deal with that emptiness when the thing you’ve relied on is gone, especially when meds aren’t an option?

I’d really love to hear from someone who gets it. I just don’t want to feel alone in this.

1kf9sxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1kf9sxc/the_new_human_revolutionvolume_i_shinichi/,The New Human Revolution-Volume I. Shin’ichi Yamamoto holds a Q&A at a discussion meeting and talks about the vast and humanistic spirit of Buddhism.,"*Synopsis: In today’s installment of “New Human Revolution, Volume I” (pp. 210-215), Shin’ichi fields a question by a member who was looking too literally on a matter of Buddhist practice.*

Bernie and I are not meeting up early this morning; we had the opportunity to talk together Saturday after the session with the Maracle family and also a bit during Coffee Hour yesterday. We talked about The Three Sisters’ emphasis on the student as worker and how they envision the classroom as if it’s the floor of a busy wood workshop. 

This made me think about a book by Phillip Schechty I read in one of my education courses, “Working on the Work: Anction Plan for Teachers, Principals, and Superintendents.” As conveyed in the title, he created a framework called “Working on the Work” or, simply, “WOW.”

According to Schlechty, teachers have to design work that is “engaging.” He tries to push educators away from the perspective of “what or how am I teaching?” to one of “what are the students learning?” Schools shouldn’t be knowledge distribution systems but more like knowledge creation systems. Instead of “covering” curriculum, teachers should see themselves as leaders, and guides to instruction. 

And then came Father Merrick’s lecture yesterday on the papal conclave when he described some of the leading contenders to become pope as well as influencers who, for various reasons, have important voices but are not contenders. One of the latter, according to Father Merrick, is Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández who led a mass for the cardinals. We talked more about him in the car when I drove him back home. He asked me to read [this Catholic News Agency article](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/263807/at-novendiales-mass-cardinal-victor-manuel-fernandez-recalls-pope-francis-love-of-work). From the Cardinal’s homily:

>What I want to show, however, is to what extent [Pope Francis] understood that his work was his mission, his everyday work was his response to God’s love, it was an expression of his concern for the good of others.

>For these reasons, work itself was his joy, his nourishment, his rest. He experienced what the first reading we heard says: “None of us lives for himself.’

>It was always a mystery to me to understand how he could endure, even being a large man with several illnesses, such a demanding work rhythm. He not only worked in the morning with various meetings, audiences, celebrations, and gatherings but also all afternoon. And it seemed to me really heroic that with the very little strength he had in his last days he made himself strong enough to visit a prison.

The cardinal emphasized that Francis never took a day off either as pope or as an archbishop and priest in Buenos Aires. “His life is an incentive to carry out our work generously.”

>Behind this love of work is a strong conviction of Pope Francis: the infinite value of every human being, an immense dignity that should never be lost, that under no circumstances can be ignored or forgotten.

So, how shall we actualize this today? We will have our Morning Meeting to gather everyone’s news from the weekend. We will do a few pages from their ELA and math *work*books and then have Center Time when students play and work independently or in small groups.

Then will come our learning *work*shop. We will study an illustration in the Edwin Tunis book “Indians” a of an Algonquin husband and wife preparing to fell a huge tree during a time when there were no metal axes. We will break them into small groups and assign them two questions to discuss: “How did this husband and wife manage to chop down the large tree with a stone axe? What clues do we see that will give us the answer?”

Bernie and I are sure this will be a very fruitful discussion. After we come back to hear their responses, we will provide art supplies and paper so they can illustrate what they have learned. 

Returning to that Q&A session in Washington, DC, Shin'ichi answered to one question with ""This is America. Therefore, please have a big, magnanimous heart as vast as this great land itself.”

In a school attempting to ignite the “spirit of the longhouse,” we need to design one classroom experience after another that opens that “big, magnanimous heart as vast as this great land itself.”

I also think this passage, although specifically about Buddhism, can be productively applied to Longhouse Elem because it hops from theory to practice.

>This was the first time that the Buddhist spirit of humanism had been outlined to the members; they were struck by its freshness and engraved it in their hearts…. 

>Kosen-rufu translates directly into the happiness of humanity and the realization of world peace. It is simply revealing and cultivating the positive state of Buddhahood inherent in all people’s lives and enveloping the world in the brilliance of friendship forged on the basis of humanism. In a sense, kosen-rufu is a movement to realize a renaissance of life in the universal realm of the human being.

1kf9shg,https://i.redd.it/4ea0xkohdyye1.jpeg,Mystery Solved ..,"No posts after Eiffel Tower due to fight while out to dinner apparently without kids again .  She thinks that’s the last ? Let’s be real . Today she let boys sleep ( likely a concession as result of fight ) . She is back to her baseball hat , Christmas shop keeper skirt , farm jacket and her new sneakers .. none seen in packing pile .  But finally blazer is resting 🤪.  They tried Metro again ( likely another concession as result of fight last night .)  I wonder if they know they can go inside Sacre Coeur and go all the way up and get the most epic pictures .. ? Obviously not . Is she the worst with pictures or what ?  Skilled only with pictures holding coffee ? 

What has become very clear is that Ashley never properly researches or prepares before jumping in with family in tow to some very expensive situations .  Let’s recap , selling everything and purchasing “ land” which they then find out will cost $$$$ for it to be suitable for building . In an RV we go $$$$ flushed down toilet , invest all money made from black house sale and book on Joie ( only 7 night stays learned after the fact ) , buy 2M house she doesn’t like with HOA which doesn’t allow shipping from garage , buying 1.5M flooding mess , spend a fortune renovating only to learn they can’t sell wine and pergola not permitted . Do nothing to grade property to avoid flooding . Invest in church only to get kicked out or force a buyout after 4 years . Next buys house in TN for 2M without selling a thing in Florida except share in church . They cherry on top .. one way ticket to London .. suddenly a month long European vacation .. not for the art or history , but for family prayer and relaxation . 🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪🤪🤣

Ashley doesn’t even sand and prime  before painting something . She was playing darts while her businesses were destroyed and outdoor furniture flew around . 

Did we ever think she would plan a trip properly ? Research in advance , maybe get a guide one day to help explain getting around ? Use a Travel service ? No … she literally took Walker Family plan and copied it . And is stuck hauling these massive duffels around thinking they will be in beach clothing for a month .  I pray they get a car service to take to train tomorrow . 

They have a lot more walking in the upcoming weeks before they are at one place for a period of time , it’s going to get hilly  , and they will have to spend $$$ to get a lounge chair . Mediterranean will be COLD and Baby has never swam where there are currents,  rocks and pebbles for beaches .  🥶

So as we follow along a person who has never even planned a dinner without help or a Trader Joe’s bag salad before , I am sure we will see more hangry kids , angry Ashley , and frustrated Dino in his one brown hat and brown coat .. (as he followed the one bag rule apparently ) things are sure to get dicey . 

And just think .. these fools are closing on a 2M house in the middle of no where in 5 weeks, without selling a thing in Florida  .. because they liked Nashville and want to homestead . This from the person who is hauling a family of six through Europe obviously out of jealousy or spite . With zero knowledge , no interest in Art or history and only  plans are Airbnb reservations ! 

I honestly wonder if this all backfires and kids never want to leave that island again . Perhaps they realize .. what will we actually DO in TN ?  No Merk or beach ? Sun all the time?  I seriously wonder if that whole thing will happen after this insane trip . The next places are so beautiful , but Ashley will feel like a country bumpkin , this is all SO out of her comfort level being surrounded by confident people , and wealthy people , and here she is with party of six all looking unhappy and worn out .  I wonder if they will actually shop the markets and cook at their Arbnb .. or if the dump and run will continue ! 

Le long post ! But so many thoughts … biggest that TN move lurking .. and will Dino and kids continue to allow Ashley to run this show ……. I personally wish I was heading to the next portion of her trip , it will be so bad if they all are miserable in those beautiful places too :(

1kf9ryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kf9ryk/explore_the_aquaboon_abc5m_water_filter_review_is/,Explore the Aquaboon AB-C5M water filter review: Is it worth it?,"The Aquaboon AB-C5M 5 Micron 10 x 2.5 Carbon Block Water Filter Cartridge has been a recent addition to my home, and it comes with a lot of promises. Claimed to be a reliable solution for whole-house water filtration, this carbon block water filter intrigued me with its specifications and positive reviews. After using it for a month in my kitchen and under-sink filtration system, I can confidently say I’ve understood both its strengths and limitations. But before diving into the details, let me share my firsthand experience.

**Performance and Functionality**  
This carbon water filter shines in its ability to eliminate impurities. It uses high-purity activated coconut shell carbon, which effectively removes chlorine, bad odors, and other chemicals from water. I noticed a significant improvement in the taste of my drinking water, and even my morning coffee seemed fresher and less harsh. The filter is rated at 5 microns, which means it even traps finer particles like sediment and other microscopic contaminants. As someone using well water at home, I found that it reduced cloudiness and provided peace of mind by eliminating harmful impurities.  

**Ease of Installation and Use**  
The installation experience was straightforward, even for someone like me who doesn’t count plumbing as their forte. It fits in standard 10-inch water filter housings, and replacing the carbon block filter doesn’t require any specialized tools or a plumber’s assistance. This quick and fuss-free replacement process is a huge plus for those who dislike DIY projects that turn into weekend-long endeavors.  

[Check Aquaboon AB-C5M price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01lybm876/)  

**Durability and Longevity**  
From what I’ve observed, the long-lasting performance touted by the product isn’t just marketing fluff. While the product description estimates a lifespan of up to six months depending on water quality, my filter still looks like it’s holding up well after a month of continuous use. Its high dirt-holding capacity is evident, as it hasn’t required any mid-cycle cleaning or maintenance yet. I’m quite optimistic about its longevity and the reduced need for frequent replacements.  

**Material Quality and Design**  
This filter is built using activated coconut shell carbon, which is not only effective but also environmentally friendly. The compact design fits snugly into my filtration system without taking too much space or feeling flimsy. The build material exudes quality, and its NSF certification adds an extra layer of trust in its safety and performance.  

**Merits**  
- Provides noticeable improvement in water taste and clarity for drinking, cooking, and washing.  
- Efficiently eliminates up to 99% of chlorine and odors.  
- Simple installation process that saves on professional plumbing costs.  
- High durability reduces frequent replacement needs.  
- Compatible with multiple models like Dupont DWC30001, Whirlpool WHKF-WHWC, and others.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- While the filter works well for most contaminants, it may not perform as effectively on heavy metals like lead, which requires specialized filtration.  
- The product is slightly bulkier compared to certain slimmer models, which might be a concern for systems with tighter spaces.  

**Competing Products**  
The water filtration market is packed with options, so standing out isn’t easy. When comparing this option with brands like Culligan and Brita filters, each has unique features. Culligan filters often include added certifications for lead removal, which is one area where this product seems to lag slightly. On the flip side, Aquaboon offers a more robust solution for chlorine removal and sediment filtration than Brita's more basic offerings. Plus, the compatibility with different systems gives it an edge over rigid alternatives.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Discussing the value of this product, it’s clear that this filter is designed to be economical in the long run. While initial costs might seem comparable to other competitors, the extended lifespan and multi-purpose compatibility make it cost-effective. For homeowners prioritizing consistent water quality without spending a fortune on replacements every few months, this product fits the bill well.

1kf9or1,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kf9or1/does_tcs_dental_appliance_cleaner_deliver_results/,Does TCS Dental Appliance Cleaner Deliver Results? In-Depth Review of This Denture Care Solution,"I recently got my hands on the TCS 4351316877 Fresh Concentrated Dental Appliance Cleaner Set, which promises to handle everything from dentures to retainers and mouthguards. As someone with a nightly routine involving dental appliances, this sounded like an ideal addition to improve my dental hygiene. After using it for a few weeks, I can confidently share the highs and lows of this product, with a good dose of firsthand experience mixed in.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and neatly organized the packaging is. The set comes with 24 single-use packets of concentrated dental appliance cleaner, enough for a six-month supply when used daily. It avoids the mess of measuring powder or guessing how much solution to use. There's even a soft-bristle brush included, which I found surprisingly decent. The whole setup feels thought-out and portable, making it easy to store at home or take along on trips. A small detail, but having the packets in a mint flavor was a nice touch—it adds freshness to your cleaning routine. The product dimensions are manageable too, fitting comfortably on the bathroom shelf without taking over all the space.  

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
I was skeptical at first about whether it could handle deep cleaning my flexible partial denture and aligner, but this cleaner impressed me. By soaking the appliance in the cleaner, even tough stains from coffee and tea started fading. The claim about removing odors held up well too, as I no longer had to deal with that unpleasant smell retainers sometimes get. After a few uses, I started noticing that stubborn tartar and plaque buildup had reduced significantly. Using the included brush for manual scrubbing added an extra layer of effectiveness. One thing to note is its overnight cleaning feature, which worked great for tougher spots like iron stains—just make sure not to overdo it with soft liners or aligners, as they recommend no more than 15 minutes of soaking.  

**Ease of Use**  
Using this cleaner couldn’t be more straightforward, even on a Monday morning when my brain is still on weekend mode. Each packet is pre-measured, so I just pour the powder into a cup with warm water, let it dissolve, and dunk the appliance in. It takes almost no effort, and because the solution is highly concentrated, you only need to leave it in for 15 minutes for a noticeable clean. For daily maintenance, this routine fits in seamlessly with your brushing and flossing schedule, though the powder can sometimes take an extra couple of seconds to dissolve fully.  

**Highlights**  
- Powerful at removing tough stains like coffee, tea, and tobacco.  
- The mint flavor leaves a fresh feeling after cleaning.  
- Includes a soft-bristle brush for scrubbing, perfect for debris removal.  
- Compact and portable design, ideal for daily or travel use.  

[Check TCS 4351316877 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b077snxpyt/)

**Limitations**  
While I’ve been satisfied overall, the product isn't without flaws. One potential downside is that it’s geared more towards users who will actively integrate it into their daily routines. If you’re someone who forgets to soak or clean regularly, the six-month supply may feel like overkill. Also, the solution can be a bit harsh if left too long—my aligner felt slightly brittle after soaking for longer than the recommended time.  

- Strict soaking time limits for sensitive materials.  
- Not ideal for anyone who doesn’t stick to consistent cleaning schedules.  
- May require scrubbing for heavier tartar and stain buildup.  

**Product Rivals**  
When stacking it against similar options like Efferdent or Polident, this set comes out ahead in portability and freshness. Polident tablets are popular, but they don’t come with a brush, so you’d have to purchase one separately. Meanwhile, Efferdent is slightly more affordable but lacks the mint flavor and often struggles with tougher stains. Where the TCS cleaner outshines them both is the clear emphasis on being a professional-grade product while still being easy enough for everyday use. However, if you’re looking for something budget-friendly and plan to clean appliances less frequently, Polident might suit you better.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
After testing this for weeks, I believe it delivers excellent bang for the buck considering its features. The six-month supply ensures you won’t need to make frequent repurchases, which is helpful for both convenience and wallet fatigue. Compared to buying a lower-quality product that might not be as effective, this one feels like a worthy investment that balances long-term results with day-to-day utility. If you care about gum health and truly clean dental appliances, it feels like smart spending.

I’m having a hard time tracking down a perfect bag. I travel on 2-4 night trips most weeks (3-4 trips a month). I’ve got back issues so I take a roller carry on with a small bag on top of the carry on which goes under the seat in front of me on flights. I use the bag when I get to my destination for work or fun. Bag has to fit a MacBook Air, iPad, light layer and headphones. MacBook is only when traveling internationally since they want to scan it separately- otherwise laptop goes in the carry on.

My go to bag for this for the last 8 years has been the first generation Osprey Daylight using the waste strap and the opening at the top of the bag between the straps.  The zippers are finally failing and the bag is covered in (mostly coffee) stains. It’s professionally unpresentable but still pretty comfy. 

I’ve tried to replaced the bag with a briefcase style bag, first from case logic as a test. I also tried the AER Travel Sling 2. I like the aer in briefcase mode but I hate using it in sling mode.

Requirements:
-Slim- has to fit standing up under an airplane seat.
-Luggage pass through or other solution
-Small capacity/dimensions- under 20L and not protruding from the side of the carry on when mounted 
-light materials
-not too much organization

Looking for any recommendations! I prefer lightweight over “bombproof” materials.

I am a local student in Varanasi. I want to tell you there are a LOT of scammers here trying to rob you!!! As an Indian, and as a citizen of Shiva's Kashi, it is my duty to help you!

For the ones who are curious, here is an example:

Today, I was at the ghats strolling with a friend of mine who is from New Zealand. We came across a white guy smoking some something with a bunch of locals. 
My white, out of curiosity, started the conversation with the white guy. Once we started talking, I got to know a lot of stuff about the other white guy.
He was from England (Danish), his better half was in Rishikesh. I asked him about the brexit,  and the divide between the Tories and the Labours.
He told me it was his fourth visit in india. His name was Louise; and he was probably two more days in Varanasi.
At this point, I told him to give me his instagram and to meet me for a cup of coffee before leaving. Just as I said this, the locals started arguing with me in Hindi, telling me not to steal their customer. I tried telling them that it was just for coffee, but they wouldn't listen. 
So, I moved on with my friend. 
I hate that locals here treat foreigners like objects.

So, Louise if you are reading this, please reach out. 

And to everyone else who is and is thinking about visiting this city, please reach out to me with any and all the questions that you have!

Using the COMLAX FIELD CF-RS23064-S4GR Patio Furniture Set daily, I’ve come to appreciate its sturdy construction. The metal frame, coated with a powder finish, feels solid and doesn't shift or creak under weight. Even with friends lounging around for hours, the loveseat, rated to hold 660 lbs, and the single chairs at 330 lbs each, showed zero signs of strain. Adjustable feet on each piece took care of uneven patio flooring, preventing any wobbling. That little feature kept my peace of mind, even when my nephew decided to turn it into a jungle gym.

**Comfortable Cushions That Hold Their Shape**

The cushions deserve a round of applause for being 4 inches thick and maintaining their shape impressively after repeated use. My mom, who’s picky about back support, even made a comment on how comfortable the ergonomic backrest felt, especially paired with the well-padded seating area. The Velcro straps attached to each cushion are a small but mighty addition. They kept the cushions from sliding off the frame, even during a spirited game of “musical chairs” with the kids. The washable covers are a lifesaver for someone like me (hello, clumsy coffee spills). Just toss them into the wash, and they’re as good as new.

[Check COMLAX FIELD CF-RS23064-S4GR price on Amazon.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b0cty4y5ln/)

**Wide Design for All Shapes and Sizes**

The wide seat and ergonomic design of this patio set genuinely impressed me. Not only does the seating feel roomy, but it’s also easy for people of all ages to stand up from it without feeling like they’ve just completed a difficult yoga pose. My grandad, who avoids most outdoor furniture for lack of support, comfortably settled into the loveseat and spent an hour reading a book—a rare sight I won't forget.

**User-Friendly Assembly Process**

I’m no DIY enthusiast, but putting this thing together was shockingly stress-free. The installation manual included numbers on each part, making it straightforward to track progress. Yes, the set arrives in two separate boxes, sometimes at different times, which might throw you off initially. However, everything fit together seamlessly using simple tools. I appreciated that even with my limited patience for assembling furniture. None of the parts felt flimsy or misaligned, which is a testament to its quality control.

**Modern Look and Minimalistic Design**

What stands out at first glance is how sleek this set looks. The clean black-grey metal frame paired with heat-treated wood grain-coated arms caught everyone’s attention. It manages to balance that modern aesthetic without looking overly flashy, and the lightweight nature of the pieces makes rearranging them a breeze. While they’re attractive, function doesn’t take a backseat, which hits the sweet spot for patio furniture.

**Positives**

- Highly durable metal frame with powder coating for rust resistance.  
- Thick, supportive cushions that maintain their shape over time.  
- Easy-to-clean cushion covers with Velcro straps for secure usage.  

**Critiques**

- Delivery in two separate boxes could be inconvenient for some.  
- While the modern design is stunning, the color might feel too neutral for those seeking bright styles.  

**Competitive Options**

Compared to close alternatives like the Devoko 5 Piece Outdoor Furniture Set or the Tangkula Patio Conversation Set, this one holds its ground firmly. The Devoko set offers similar cushion thickness, but its backrest doesn’t provide the same ergonomic support. Tangkula’s design, while functional, lacks the modern flair of heat-treated wooden arm finish, which I love about the COMLAX FIELD set. Both competitors also fall short with their assembly instructions, often leading to confusion that this product avoids entirely.

**Worth Every Penny**

Considering the balance between quality, durability, and aesthetics, this patio furniture is a standout in its price range. While there are cheaper alternatives, they often compromise on the small details that make a difference—be it cushion comfort, design aesthetics, or frame durability. If investing a little more ensures that pesky wobble is avoided and the set lasts longer, I’d say it’s worth it.

As someone who strums daily, both for casual play and recording sessions, I've really had the chance to test every nook and cranny of this product. It struck me as a versatile tool for both beginners learning chord progressions and intermediate players seeking a solidly built instrument bundled with essential accessories.

**Build Quality and Design**  
One of the first things that stood out to me was its robust mahogany body. The wood finish exudes warmth, visually and acoustically. Its concert size is ideal—not too bulky to hold for extended periods, yet ample enough to produce rich sounds. I especially enjoyed the smooth walnut fretboard with rolled edges, which makes transitioning between chords buttery smooth. Featuring six strings made of bronze and a fixed pickup configuration, this guitar is balanced, lightweight at 9.65 pounds, and perfect for right-handed players like myself. Small details, like the satin finish and the nato neck, elevate the entire build quality without feeling overly flashy.  

**Comfort and Playability**  
What makes this guitar a standout for me is the new ""easy-to-play"" neck shape. It eliminates much of the finger strain I typically experience with some other acoustic guitars. Whether attempting barre chords or playing intricate fingerstyle arrangements, every movement feels natural and fluid, even after hours of practice. This feature proves particularly welcoming if you're just starting out or have smaller hands.  

[Check Fender AUS-0970150422 price on Amazon.](https://guitarharbor.com/p/b08fbl2gk1/)  

**Sound Performance**  
This guitar doesn’t just look great—it sounds fantastic. The mahogany top offers a mellow, textured tone that leans toward warm mids. The balance across the tonal range makes it suitable for various genres; I went from folk ballads to jazz improvisation without losing tonal clarity. While it doesn’t quite generate powerful projection as dreadnoughts do, the concert size still delivers more than enough resonance for intimate settings like living room jam sessions or small coffee shop gigs.

**Included Accessories**  
The bundle is packed with everything a player might need. The gig bag is durable, though slightly basic, and is fine for casual transport. A strap and extra strings are included too, which I often overlook until I desperately need spares mid-rehearsal. The highlight, in my opinion, is access to the Fender Play online lessons. It’s such a useful tool—I tested it on my nephew, who's completely new to the guitar, and within days, he was strumming his first song. The tuner and instructional DVD, while somewhat dated, also provide a boost for beginners.  

**Advantages**  
- Highly resonant sound thanks to a solid mahogany build.  
- Easy-to-play neck minimizes strain for long sessions.  
- Comprehensive accessories, including Fender Play online lessons, make it beginner-friendly.  
- Lightweight and compact without sacrificing tonal depth.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The gig bag lacks extra padding and feels less protective for extensive travel.  
- Although the concert size delivers warmth, it might fall short in volume for larger venues.  
- The bronze strings included with the guitar wear out relatively quickly compared to other premium options.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
One competitor to consider is Yamaha’s FG830, which also features a solid top but swaps out mahogany for spruce. The sound tends to be brighter, which might appeal more to those focused on country or bluegrass tones. Although Yamaha lacks bundled extras like Fender Play lessons, their FG series boasts undeniable durability and tone quality. I also tested the Taylor GS Mini, a similarly compact guitar with excellent tonal range, though it edges towards a significantly higher price point and doesn’t come with accessories.

**Worth Every Penny**  
From someone who plays both for fun and on semi-professional stages, I find this product to offer fantastic value. Guitar bundles can sometimes be hit-or-miss, but here, Fender matches quality with practicality. The additional features and educational tools are excellent selling points, especially when compared to piecing together a beginner kit yourself. Considering all the extras, including lessons, the investment seems fair for players stepping into the world of acoustic music or upgrading from their first instrument.

I currently do not take any supplements or medication. Have weaned off many things in the near past. Here’s what’s helped me.


- meditation with deep breathing. Helps to chill out which can help GI distress. we all know SIBO  contributes to poor mental health so it’s a vicious cycle. Make sure to feed your mind body and soul holistically. 


- before you do this consult a doctor, but I was taking feramax 150 mg for a couple months consistently when I noticed my extremely gassy rotten egg smell farts were gone when I accidently skipped a dose. I tested this theory a couple of times before I decided to divide my capsule into 1/7 and then just taking it with food. High doses of iron feed bad gut bacteria as a lot of it goes unabsorbed. I need it so im still taking it but now it’s every other day at a fraction of the dose. I had to work from home because I was legit farting every few seconds I seriously almost gave up thinking they would be my life  forever .

- I’ve never been a big sugar or sweets or soda person but I did notice how I craved so much of these junk foods and sweets when I started supplementing the iron. Bacteria was in full control. I began binging . When I stopped the iron , cravings stopped with it.  I’ve made serious changes to my diet past year and I do intermittent fasting twice a week, home cook 90% of meals. Cut out unnecessary foods. I go on walks about an hour post dinner.. 

- don’t drink liquids 30 mins prior to meals and 30
Mins post meals. Don’t dilute ur stomach acid . I suspect people with sibo have low stomach acid . Look into taking a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with warm water about an hour prior to fatty/ carb, /protein rich meals …. it can help digest but don’t take apple cider vinegar every day don’t outsource your stomachs job to something else. 

- chew your food to a liquid consistency before you swallow. This has helped me a lot I thought I used to chew my food well before. It’s crazy how we all make it harder for our gut to absorb nutrients and make it harder for stomach to digest food. My jaw is getting a work out every meal but it’s so worth it I don’t feel bloated or nauseated or bubbly guts and the flatulence is near gone. 


- no for me but since almost everyone is addicted to coffee you should cut down, it increases anxiety, makes it harder to get good sleep at night (vital for any healing in the body) , and increases acid reflux singer other things.  If you smoke anything or drink alcohol  you need to quit it too. Be serious about moving your body more. Bring your body as close to its natural baseline as possible. 

I’ve tried almost every supplement and seen every dr you can think of. They can help somewhat if you’re lucky but  change starts at the lifestyle level. ",6,1746445134.0,SIBO,1,1.0,False

1kf99d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kf99d1/its_been_a_month_since_i_last_spoke_to_her_was/,It's been a month since I last spoke to her. Was she toxic?,"Starting from the beginning...

I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started seeing a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her L.

We had a very strong connection right away, but things have been really difficult between us.

From the beginning, it was already hard to go out with L (it took about 2–3 attempts before we managed to meet up), and even after we did, things didn’t get easier.

L has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her ex-boyfriends, and from the start, she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is, even though she acted that way, she also showed signs of wanting something serious, like being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to go out with her and her family, and—believe it or not—getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, these past months were also full of ups and downs, with her wanting distance during her crises and me always being patient, trying to talk to her and make her feel better.

It went on like that until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and that we wouldn’t be hooking up anymore.

At that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I'll call her N). N ended up helping me during that period. She supported me through the breakup and even gave me advice about the situation.

N invited me to go out about three times, but I declined all of them because of L.

L and I had some fights before, but I consider this one the worst.

It was December, I was coming back from work when L messaged me saying she woke up horny and was going to have sex because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had hooked up with before her last ex).

I tried talking to her at the time because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play League of Legends.

I spent the whole day trying to talk to her about it, but she kept saying to give her some space. We only talked normally again when I didn’t bring up the topic.

The next night, after things had cooled off, I brought it up again. L said she didn’t go through with it, but she also didn’t admit that it was a lie. She just said she lost interest.

So I told her about N and how N had invited me to go out (which was true). I said this girl didn’t seem romantically interested in me—she seemed to want friendship only. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing with her friends at her house.

I told L and asked if I could go. I even said that, if she wanted, we could date and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want a relationship with me.

L said it was fine, but from her tone, I felt it wasn’t.

The next day, L made plans with her cousin and pretended to be on a date just to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted she had said all that just to test me. She also compared me to her exes.

She blocked me on WhatsApp, and in desperation, I ran out of the house to go see her and brought a bouquet and some things she liked (energy drink and chocolate) to try and fix the situation. I also messaged N, said we couldn’t talk anymore, and blocked her.

In the end, L and I made up, but everything got even worse.

Some time after the fight, L said I screwed up by blocking N, and even though she told me to unblock her, I insisted on keeping her blocked.

Eventually, I started thinking it over and realized I had been a jerk to N, and it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of L.

L had always been honest with me from the beginning and said she didn’t want anything serious (even though she showed otherwise). She always made it clear I was her best friend.

Because of that, a few days ago, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing. She accepted the apology but said she didn’t want to be involved in this drama anymore.

The thing is, I didn’t tell L that I had unblocked N.

On Saturday, we went out for coffee and were talking until we brought up the topic of our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She ended up wanting to see the girl’s profile, and after a bit of pressure, I admitted I had unblocked her.

From that moment, her mood changed during our outing and she wanted to go home. That night we were supposed to watch Big Brother Brasil together, but she didn’t want to anymore. After midnight, she sent me a video crying. I tried talking to her, and she said I wasn’t honest with her.

Sunday came, and things only got worse. She said all she wanted was honesty and told me I was never honest with her, that I always lied, and she didn’t want a lying friend.

I kept trying to calm her down, but it just kept escalating. She called me, cried harder than ever before, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N talked to me, and I explained the situation. N was pissed at me, said L and I were both crazy and immature, and that she had bigger problems than this. She said she never had any romantic interest in me and that the whole idea of friendship was dead. Then she blocked me and L.

I told L what happened, she asked for screenshots, I showed her, and it made her feel even worse. She sent a long message saying she forgave me but that it would be better if we went our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing happened.

I insisted and insisted until she got angry and blocked me (something she said she wouldn’t do).

I got blocked on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and several fake Facebook accounts I created trying to talk to her.

I even went to her house with a chocolate bar and a letter saying I was at the park near her place, but she didn’t show up or unblock me. She only unblocked me after I started sending 1-cent Pix transfers to her bank account, just for her to see the messages. She replied very rudely, told me not to bother her, and blocked me again.

L ended up messaging my mom saying I was harassing her and that she’d go to the police if I kept doing it. My mom talked to her, said she liked her but that, for both our sakes, it was best we stayed apart. L played the victim, said she was trying to move on, but I kept bothering her.

My mom came to talk to me and told me to stop bothering L and asked what had happened. I explained the whole story. My mom thought it didn’t make sense. She messaged L again, said she had talked to me, and also said it didn’t make sense for L to be mad at me since we weren’t even dating (which she always stated and confirmed again to my mom). She said my social media and phone were mine, and I could block or unblock whoever I wanted. I didn’t need to give anyone explanations for that.

Some time later, on Wednesday, things got even worse. I had lent my phone to my mom to check some stuff on my bank app. Everything was fine until suddenly my mom started arguing with someone on my phone. When I checked, it was L.

Basically, even after I stopped bothering her, L kept posting lots of indirect messages on Facebook saying she preferred to be seen as the bad one, that it was a blessing in disguise (livramento), that she didn’t want dishonest people, etc. She posted all of this while having me blocked and while still having my mom on Facebook (she knew my mom was there). At first, she posted on her stories so my mom would see it, but later she started posting it on her feed.

My mom got tired of it, took a screenshot of one of L’s indirect posts, and posted it on her WhatsApp stories, indirectly calling L toxic.

L saw it, liked the story, and reacted with a clapping emoji, but behind my mom’s back, she unblocked me and tried to turn me against her. She said now she understood why I was messed up, because my mom was just like me, and that it really was a livramento.

Long story short, L and my mom had a big fight. I still tried to calm things down with L, but she never apologized. She told me to delete all our messages, not to share her address, and said this could turn into something serious. She also said she had sent my mom’s audio messages to the police (which was a bluff).

I tried a bit more, and she said it wouldn’t work, and that it would be better if we stayed away from everything. She blocked me and asked her cousin to block me too.

It’s been a month since I last talked to L… and it hurts so much...

Even though my friends and family, who know the whole story, say she was toxic, I still miss her. If she came back, I would definitely take her back and try to fix everything...

I keep thinking that, if I hadn’t been so emotional and had just kept N blocked, L might still be here...",0,1746444510.0,BPDlovedones,0,0.4,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Floonk, Vaces - Sonar 💎 [Selfreleased]**  
*Recommended if you like: Aegis, Scurrow, Kevala*  

I feel like it has been a whole while since we've had a proper _Hidden Gem Of The Week™️_ on here. I swear artists just blow up past my arbitrary 1000 listeners rule way more quickly nowadays, this used to be very easy for me! Even the one I picked for today is kind of cheating, as one of them is already way past that barrier - but who really cares? Let's talk about two exciting Dutch talents, **Floonk** and **Vaces**. 

You might remember the latter from our [spotlight of _SubCulture Recordings'_ _Nomos_ compilation a couple weeks back](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnB/s/yy2cyYqDLs), but Ruben, the vace behind the Vacade, is so profusely prolific, he's already put out a whole bunch of entirely new singles. Not only were we treated to another outing on _SubCulture_ and a couple more self-released bangers, he's even explored the world of underground Hip-Hop on _JENEVER ANTHEM_ together with _zem_ and _LukaVonk_! Even though his last mini long player is barely a year old, Mr. Vaatstra is also already gearing up to his _second_ LP - the hype is real! 

And the former? That one's new, right? That's exactly right, non-existent person asking me this question! 24-year-old **Floonk**'s journey into DnB is literally only just beginning, with his bootleg of _Former_'s _Groningen_, some horizontally rotating DnBrainrot with previous spotlight features _SIMONS_ and _Tom Dune_, and his first original _Never Back Down_ with _Uffern_ having only rolled through in this very year, but as always, there's of course more backstory to be explored. But not all that much, to be fair! Back in 2021, the Netherlandian sound magician started out by writing heartbreaking piano pieces with _Julia Lefers_ under his real name, **Siebe Nicolai**, but when it came time for him to explore the more electronic side of music in 2022, he needed a new name - Floonk was born! After smashing out his debut Future Bass releases with _G Cameron_, he's widened his genre aspirations to also include Trap, and even Acoustic vibes, working with vocal talents like _Stella Key_, _Sergio Ochoa_ and _Jasper Lucas_, and fellow up-and-coming producers _Despotem_ and _Blckbrd_. Since a couple of months, however, he's found a new love: The drums! And, as it turns out, also the basses! 

After multiple ID showcase posts, and the aforementioned release of a couple of them, it's now time to unleash a particularly weighty ID that's been teased in those _months_ ago: **Sonar**! Boards creaking under the immense pressure of the deep sea, the sonar beeps being our sole, relentless companion amidst the occasional mission briefing radio chatter - this might seem like any ordinary submarine exploration mission, but far from it. Though we were warned about low pressure systems ahead, and witnessed unusually loud rumblings inside our vessel, that did not deter us from plowing ahead, until we crash right into a maelstrom of techy, syncopated rhythms, distant hardstyle kicks and chilling roars of otherworldly beasts throwing us off-course, into the deepest of the deep ends. 

Already plenty lethal on their own, these Dutch talents reach _even deeper_ depths when combined, exploring all sorts of powerful cinematic imagery and floonkslaughts of vace-scrunching bassery. 

Unrelated to much of anything but: It is very funny to me that I'm writing about this sort of deep sea misadventure while I'm sitting in a Eurostar train, literally travelling underneath the English Channel right now. Anyway, here's some other techy bangers from this week:  
- Rillium - Terminal EP  
- Joro Dudovski - Blurs Of Color  
- Azumai - Rude Boi  
- Curious Mind - She Knows It  
- Flowidus, Cecelia - Fever Thoughts  

---

####**2. Hologram - Crossfire [Eatbrain]**  
*Recommended if you like: Absu_NTQL, Prdk, Mob Tactics*  

Now onto a name I probably should've covered ages ago - or, well, _names_. That's right, our second spotlight shines its illuminance on Horsham-based trio **Hologram**! Before we get to any of those collabrorative shenanigans, however, let's break down the players involved first.

**2.1.1. De:Tune**

First up is David Waghorn, perhaps best known as **De:Tune**! While his first few outings under the alias trace back to the mid 2010s, with his runner-up entry in _Drum&Bass Arena_'s remix competition for Optiv and BTK's _Ignition_ in 2013 and the widely-supported _Purge_ on Ed Rush & Optical's _Fabriclive 82_ mix in 2015 being the only (kinda) released works from that era, things arguably only _really_ kicked into high gear when 2018 rolled around. After years of wag-honing his skills, he's not only unleashed his debut EP on ProgRAM that year, he was also responsible for a little tune called _Poveglia_ with this promising up-and-coming vocalist. In the afterglow of this rather successful, in my eyes still absolutely iconic piano anthem, not a whole lot more De:Tunes were leaving the creation pipeline, until he finally said _Au Revoir_ with his EP of the same name in 2021. Before we get to the project he instead devoted his time to, though, let's jump to the next name on the list. 

**2.1.2. Citrusfly**

The next piece in this particular puzzle: Richard **Citrusfly** Clements! Since about 2012, this one has been throwing out heavily dubby wubs all over labels like _Pick'n'Mix_, _BYTHEPRODUCER_, _Sublow_, _Dubplate Mafia_ (incredible label name) and _Dub Damage, appeared on early releases with _K Motionz_, remixed _SOTA_ and collaborated with _DJ Gaw_. A whole _'nother_ world of influences and different sound ideas, in other words! Additionally, he was part of _The Argonauts_ with _J-Rex_ and _Lash Lams_ and, according to the still yet to be discussed last man in this group, only hasn't finished and released more of his banging ideas because he has the _""discipline of a drunk toddler""_ - which might be another reason this collaborative thing has been working so well for them. So, who is that last unknown variable then?
 
**2.1.3. Degs**

That's right, the other Poveglihalf! Andrew Ndegwa **""Degs""** Davies, ""some dude"" who has arguably perfected the art of merging rap and singing in the world of DnB, becoming one of _the_ faces of current day _Hospital Records_ in the process. A name big enough that he would deserve his own, in-depth spotlight, but until then let's a short(ish) version: Not only did the Kenyan-British lad grow up playing guitar, piano and drums both solo and in various band projects, since all the way back in 2007 (!) he's also become obsessed with writing and performing lyrics, especially on DnB beats. When he wasn't busy working his day job in sales, he was hosting jump up raves, writing and producing Hip-Hop with his brother _MURIUKI_ as **Kikuyu Soul** or freestyling over liquid vibes by _Lenzman_ and _Redeyes_. Said freestyles eventually made their way to _Hospital Records_' executive floor and soon enough, his and his close mate David's anthem _Poveglia_ hit the clinical shelves. 

Whether it was him putting his stamp on his favourite Hospital releases via his _Mixtape Sprayout_ series, featuring on tunes by the likes of _Logistics_ (on his LP _Hologram_, coincidentally enough), _Whiney_ or _Makoto_, or his own work in collaboration with _Pola & Bryson_, _Unglued_, _In:Most_ and many more for his very own original music for his debut album, Degs has and still very much is absolutely _killing_ it. He's been hosting and playing Hospital stages all over the _world_, sharpening and flexing his production skills, entertained the online masses with his _Degscast_ format, until not too long ago took over the official _Hospital_ radio and was even part of Forza Horizon's radio crew! Not to mention his newest album dropping in like three days! Enough about him though, let's finally talk about the Hologram project.
 
**2.2. Hologram**

First of all, perhaps some actually important context: these three Horsham lads have been each other's best friends for _ages_. Hell, they've been bridesmen at each other's weddings! So of course they would try working together here and there, and with Poveglia, the odd Citrusfly ideas posted on Facebook and the actual fully fledged collab _Final Notice_ on Degs' second Sprayout mixtape, they've shown how well they mesh, even musically. So when lockdown first hit, and Andrew's finances were in absolute shambles due to the sudden drop in bookings, the three friends decided to create a Patreon together to tide him over until the things open up again. Born out of this pandemic-induced necessity, they started hanging out together in the studio way more often, and eventually, they decided to give a whole separate trio project a try - **Hologram** was born! 

Since their debut on the late and great _RAM Records_' _Riot_ compilation in late 2021, the lads became staples at René LaVice's _DeVice_, showed off their dreamy and melodic sides some more on _Spearhead_, made the world a slightly better place with their contributions to the charity label _Floodlight_, and put on some heat on _Grand Theft Audio_ and _Smokin Riddims_. With _Hang Up The Mic_ off of Degs' upcoming album, they've also crossed off several bucket list items for the project: Releasing on Hospital, working with the legendary _Ragga Twins_, and earning their first _UKF_ upload! Now, they've cranked up the already usually high nastiness levels even further into full-on Neuro territory, with their debut on Jade's one and only **Eatbrain**! 

**2.3. Crossfire**

We open the door into Hologram's most aggressive soundscapes so far with title track **Crossfire** - yes, this is actually a double single. Slowly at first, but then with violently pounding heart, we approach the ravaged battlefield, home to only a particularly catchy acid-y synth. That is, until the enemy forces open fire. With a swift _""crossfire""_ vocal insert, the team unleashes a whirlwind of relentless staccato neuro whomps fighting against gutteral alien screams, while truly nasty basses cause more than just one earthquake underneath it all. Sure, with the return of the synth, we get into a bit of a less aggressive, and more groovey groove, and can even get some much-needed rest in the breakdown, but the attack was for _sure_ not a one-off, and destroys every fiber of our beings one last time in the second half. Flipside **No Contest** takes a similar amount of prisoners, leading us into the madness with some proper wicked Reggae-esque vocals, before conjuring up an unrelenting storm of heavyweight bass hits, powerful snare action and dubby vocal vibes. 

**2.4. Conclusion**

As if their discography so far wasn't diverse enough already, the Horsham trio takes it whole 'nother couple of steps _further_ with their heaviest, nastiest, hologrambunctious-est tunes so far. 

Other Neuro from this week:

1kf97ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1kf97ro/i_lost_lost_73_kg_161_lbs_in_30_days_using/,"I lost  Lost 7.3 kg (16.1 lbs) in 30 days using ChatGPT. No gym, lots of calorie deficit.","*TL;DR at the end.*

**Some background:**  
I’m a 5’3” (160 cm), 42-year-old woman with a very demanding job that keeps me on my feet 9 to 12 hours a day, most days, without a break. I also commute by foot or bike — a bit more than 1.25 miles total, six days a week.  
I’m also a mom to a very active 8-year-old.  
And, of course, a housewife.

So my days mostly look like this:  
Wake up. Stuff my mouth with whatever’s around. Do chores. Go to work. Bake, cook, clean, make coffee, serve, repeat. Then stuff my mouth again with whatever cake or pastry I craved that day. Go home. Cook or order food. Eat whatever the family’s eating. Family time. Hit the sack.

I used to think that since I worked so hard all day, I must be burning off all the cakes, lattes, and late-night pizzas.

Until one day, my husband offered me the scale after him.

I mean, I knew I was gaining weight (I’ve never been a thin girl), but I didn’t realize it had gotten that bad. That night, I stopped eating and downloaded the Fastic app. Because I knew I had to start somewhere.

And, like any human with common sense, I asked ChatGPT what to do next.

It said “calorie deficit,” and we started.

**What ChatGPT helps me with:**

* Calculating all food macros instantly (even from a photo)
* Selecting food for me when we are eating outside
* Analyzing trends in digestion, water retention, and sleep
* Warning me when I push too far or under-eat
* Monitoring my blind spots (over-efficiency, ignoring emotions, normalizing burnout)
* Giving me meal plans, recipes, macros, and timelines
* Calming me with science when the scale doesn’t move for 3 days
* Keeping me company on this lonely trip

**Progress measurements from April 8 till now:**

* **Waist:** 88 cm → 82 cm (–6 cm / 2.4 in)
* **Hips:** 105 cm → 103 cm (–2 cm / 0.8 in)
* **Weight:** 75.0 kg → 67.7 kg (–7.3 kg / 16.1 lbs)

People started to tell me that I look different.  
I, of course, still have my belly. My arms are still wide like a huggable gorilla.  
But jeans are looser? T-shirts fit better. I look better.

**What I did:**

* Kept calories around 900–1,100 kcal/day
* Protein target: 50–60 g/day
* Water: 1.5–2 L/day
* Fasting: 14–16 hours most days
* Movement: 6k–10k steps/day, biking, Ring Fit, light running, some yoga
* Supplements: multivitamin, magnesium, omega-3
* Period-related weight bumps: tracked and managed
* All food tracked by weight in grams — every single bite

**Do I feel better?**  
Hell no. I am more exhausted than before — especially on my really busy days.  
I crave foods that I used to love. I miss my nightly wines. I hate cooking for the family and then sitting and eating tofu salad.

But I always keep in mind where I was and where I am going.

**My goals are:**

* 64.0 kg by May 18
* Next: 60.0 kg
* Then: 54.0 kg

And here is a prompt that ChatGPT itself created to give yours a similar job:

“You are my daily weight loss accountability partner. Track every bite I eat, every gram, and calculate the calories/macros with high precision. Speak bluntly. Be emotionally neutral but fiercely honest. Warn me if I’m too lax, too extreme, or missing something obvious.

I want fast results without harming my health. Give me meal ideas based on what I actually have. Help me understand plateaus, digestion, hormone effects, and how to work *with* my body, not against it.

I will tell you what I eat, how I feel, and what I do — and you will log, analyze, and strategize accordingly, day after day.”

Of course, you will need to give it your personal information — as detailed as you can. And I would suggest telling it what you already have in your pantry.

TL;DR:

I’m a 42-year-old mom, café owner, and a whirlwind of chores, running around, and baking — constantly on my feet. I used to eat mindlessly and assumed my crazy workdays burned it all off... until the scale said otherwise. So I got serious: started fasting, tracking every gram, and cut calories to 900–1,100/day with a focus on protein. With ChatGPT as my eating coach, I’ve dropped over 7 kg and shrunk my waist by 6 cm. I’m exhausted, grumpy about tofu, and miss wine — but I’m doing the damn thing. Goal: 64 kg by May 18, then down to 54.",0,1746444359.0,WeightLossAdvice,8,0.22,False

I am a local student in Varanasi. I want to tell you there are a LOT of scammers here trying to rob you!!! As an Indian, and as a citizen of Shiva's Kashi, it is my duty to help you!

For the ones who are curious, here is an example:

Today, I was at the ghats strolling with a friend of mine who is from New Zealand. We came across a white guy smoking some something with a bunch of locals. 
My white friend, out of curiosity, started the conversation with the white guy. Once we started talking, I got to know a lot of stuff about the other white guy.
He was from England (Danish), his better half was in Rishikesh. I asked him about the brexit,  and the divide between the Tories and the Labours.
He told me it was his fourth visit in india. His name was Louise; and he was probably two more days in Varanasi.
At this point, I told him to give me his instagram and to meet me for a cup of coffee before leaving. Just as I said this, the locals started arguing with me in Hindi, telling me not to steal their customer. I tried telling them that it was just for coffee, but they wouldn't listen. 
So, I moved on with my friend. 
I hate that locals here treat foreigners like objects.

So, Louise if you are reading this, please reach out. 

And to everyone else who is and is thinking about visiting this city, please reach out to me with any and all the questions that you have!

1kf919k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kf919k/could_the_mr_coffee_brew_now_or_later_coffeemaker/,Could the Mr. Coffee Brew Now or Later Coffeemaker review help your mornings?,"The Mr. Coffee 2176667 Brew Now or Later coffeemaker has been a staple in my kitchen routine for weeks now. As someone who takes coffee seriously (but not pretentiously, I promise), I’ve had more than my fair share of experiences with various coffee makers over the years. I was particularly intrigued by the programmable element of this machine. A device that’s supposed to simplify mornings and deliver that first cup of caffeine with minimal effort? Count me in. The combination of user-friendly features and sleek design immediately caught my attention. Let’s dive into the firsthand details.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This programmable coffee maker boasts a surprisingly modern and compact design that fits nicely in my modestly sized kitchen. When unpacking it, I appreciated the clean, black finish. It’s simple, not fussy, and manages to look sleek without standing out too much. The size is just right—not too bulky, yet large enough to brew for a crowd if needed. With dimensions of 8.9""D x 13.1""W x 13.8""H, I could tuck it into a corner without it stealing all the counter space. One thing a colleague pointed out during her visit was that the buttons are tactile and intuitive. The LED display is bright and straightforward, allowing even the most digitally challenged among us to set the timer.  

**Highlights**  
- Brew Now or Later feature for programming your perfect coffee schedule.  
- A Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause for those moments before the brew is done.  
- Lift-and-Clean Filter Basket to simplify maintenance.  
- Slick and easy-to-navigate programmable LED Display.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2176667 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b089dwfp9l/)  

**Performance That Matches Expectations**  
The real selling point for me was the Brew Now or Later function. Testing it out, I set it up the night before, cautiously measuring coffee grounds and water. Believe it or not, waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee makes mornings a bit less cruel. It’s like having a personal barista—only without the awkward small talk. The Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause actually saved me one desperate morning when I prematurely poured myself a cup before the brewing cycle was complete, impressed that it resumed where it left off without making a mess.  

In terms of brewing itself, the process seems faster than other machines I’ve tried. The taste falls somewhere on the spectrum of smooth and balanced, although I wouldn’t label it a substitute for the $6 barista-made delights. My uncle, a notorious coffee critic, gave it a nod of approval when he visited—high praise from the guy who grumbles over most brews.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
This coffee maker earns a gold star for maintenance. The Lift and Clean filter basket is well-designed for simplicity. I just pull it up, rinse it out, and I'm good to go. For someone who avoids manual labor in the mornings (or let’s be honest, in general), the ease of cleaning definitely scored points. The water reservoir’s transparent layout ensures I didn’t overfill or spill—a surprisingly useful feature I hadn’t appreciated until clumsier models spilled my previous attempts.  

**Who’s This Coffee Maker For?**  
Whether you’re living alone, sharing space with family, or hosting guests occasionally, this appliance caters to multiple needs. A neighbor who came over for brunch marveled at how it handled producing a pot for all of us. The 12-cup capacity seems excessive for just one or two people unless you're fueling a work marathon, but it’s nice to have when entertaining. Coffee aficionados, specifically those who value convenience and reliability over intricate brewing methods, may find this machine particularly appealing.  

**Pluses**  
- Compact yet functional design.  
- Easy setup for delayed brewing convenience.  
- Low maintenance with reusable filter.  

**Negative Attributes**  
While I generally loved the experience, a few quirks stood out:  
- It’s not the quietest coffee maker. Those pre-dawn brewing sessions might wake light sleepers under the same roof.  
- The instruction manual could do with a user-friendly tweak; figuring out some features required a bit of trial and error.  
- If you’re an espresso lover, this might not deliver the punchy richness you’d expect.  

**Competitive Options**   
Taking a look at the competition, the Mr. Coffee Brew Now or Later faces brands like Cuisinart DCC-3200 or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Cuisinart offers a more precise temperature control feature, which elevates the overall coffee flavor but comes with a heftier price tag. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew dives into versatility with the ability to use single-serve pods alongside ground coffee; however, it sacrifices simplicity in design and demands slightly more countertop space. Where Mr. Coffee wins is in programmability for its price range and a truly user-friendly interface. My sister owns the FlexBrew and admits she’s envious of how much simpler my coffee-making ritual is.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the simplicity and added features like programmable brewing and a reusable filter, this machine falls firmly in the affordable quality range. It delivers value that aligns well with its cost without feeling overpriced. You might find more refined brewing features on expensive machines, but for the everyday coffee drinker looking for good coffee without a manual, this is hard to beat.

Organized the first four shelves of the cabinets. I’m too short to reach the others. 

Found out that apparently my mom never cleaned them out after my great grandmother passed away, over 30 years ago. So I found some spices, teas, candy, and coffee that belonged to her in there. 

Now, this cleaning session was a mix between a “get the food out of the cabinets so we can have more space” and a “what is in here?” Session. I will be organizing it more efficiently later. 

I cleared the red table again because it was where we were storing what we wanted to keep, so I finally threw it all in a storage bin to keep it safe from the mice 

Not pictured: someone on my last post said to remove the paper towels from the alcove so the mice wouldn’t be attracted to it, I removed them today. 




Sorry for the absence, Easter plans ate into my cleaning schedule and both mom and I realized after staying the night at my grandparents, that my grandmother, who has dementia, is not doing as well as we thought she was. So I ended up going back after a few days to spend over a week at my grandparents to help care for my grandmother ",14,1746443656.0,UnfuckYourHabitat,1,0.95,False

 I (27M) have a friend (29F) that always blames me for the miss encounters.

A few times I would be busy with work, it’s 20km away from the city where she works, so sometimes when I used to go to the city I used to find her there and give her a lift close to her home off the city whenever.

So the problem starts when I would think I’d go to the city and I would tell her since we chatted a lot, but would end up busy and not call her to meet up to give a lift. Sometimes I would be in the city and just say that i am or would be. She would wait for me somewhere thinking I’d pick her up, while it was not on my plans.

One day she got angry all of a sudden and I felt bad because i did not know she used to assume every time i said im in town It meant Im available, so i offered to pay a taxi for her to go home. She refused saying she wanted me to pick her up. I did not because i was busy and would not return home anytime soon, and i told her multiple times, but she was insisting. She returned with a friend of hers.


The other day she gave me a laptop for me to fix. I fixed it and I asked if she really wanted the laptop on the same day or if I could give her the next day. The next day It would have been easier for me to give the laptop because i had a lot to do on the current day. She insisted she wanted on the current day. So I went to deliver a product to a client first after I left work. She started calling asking where I was, I told her i was delivering a product and she could meet me there so she could retrieve the laptop. She insisted I deliver and meet her at a spot 1km away from my delivery point. So after delivering the product I had a date with my girlfriend and I picked her up since it was in the same direction my friend was waiting. Together we give her the laptop and ask if she wanted a lift to the closest bus stop. She refused saying she wanted to get home fast, so she took the bus nearby.
After i get home i text my friend wanting to know hows the laptop and if she got home safe. She said she got robbed at the bus stop and they took her laptop. I felt bad for her and gave her strength. She responded saying it would not have happened if i told her i was busy that day. I got a little mad and sad and did not respond, because it would start a discussion.

The next day she calls and says she faked getting robbed and it should serve as a lesson for me and she liked the laptop. It really got on my nerves and I ghosted her for some time.

Few months passed She sent me a picture of a new coffee place i really like. I tell her I like the muffins there and we can go on a friday at 5pm. So i can buy the muffin. The day arrives and at 4:50pm i send a text greeting (no response). 5:20pm I start calling and no answer. By 5:50pm she calls back saying she was still at work and would leave late. I say no worries. Even though she could have warned me, but I brushed it off since it was work related and the focus can make people forget.

She said nothing after leaving work and the whole weekend. Then sunday she greets me by text asking if we could go on monday to the coffee place. I say i will be busy and maybe another day.
She then responds to not text her to confirm if the plan is ""on"" in the final hour. I thought weird, because she did not answer.

Another day she admitted that she did it on purpose to get me back from the event where I ""led"" and left her waiting months ago. 

I know im socially dumb and weird and should have known that updates I used to give her when i was around town would mislead. But was I actually a bad friend?",0,1746443324.0,AITAH,1,0.33,False

1kf8wlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyLive/comments/1kf8wlj/can_simple_mills_chocolate_brownie_cookies/,Can Simple Mills Chocolate Brownie Cookies Deliver on Flavor and Nutrition? Honest Review,"The Simple Mills H-1311 Chocolate Brownie Cookies quickly became my go-to snack during testing. They had me intrigued from the start with a promise of being gluten-free, paleo-friendly, and genuinely wholesome. Being a bit of a food enthusiast, I put them to the ultimate test: sharing them with my colleagues during our daily coffee break. Something about these cookies felt special. It might have been the intriguing blend of nut and seed flours, or maybe it was the promise of “real” and “purposeful” ingredients. Either way, everyone had plenty to say about them, some comments good and others, well… let’s just dive into it!  

**Packaging and Presentation**  
The first impression counts, and here, the product delivered in spades. Tightly packed into a 4.25-ounce box, these cookies manage to remain intact even after surviving the horror of being thrown into my tote alongside heavy books and tumbling water bottles. The branding is clean and minimalistic, reflecting the natural and nutritious vibe it promises. Luckily, the resealable bag inside is a real lifesaver, keeping cookies fresh and crunchy until the last crumb. Though three packs per order look generous, be prepared—they vanish quickly!  

**Taste and Texture**  
Chocolate brownie flavor? Yes, please. I noticed a pleasantly light, crispy texture—probably thanks to the watermelon seed flour mixed with cashew and sunflower flours. Sweetened just right with coconut sugar at around 7g per serving, the taste is neither overly indulgent nor underwhelming but nails a satisfying middle ground. No weird artificial aftertaste here, which is a huge win. Plus, the seed and nut blend adds dimension, making every bite uniquely enjoyable. However, be forewarned: this isn’t your typical sugar-laden brownie experience. Some coworkers missed the expected richness found in conventional chocolate treats.  

[Discover the Simple Mills H-1311 price on Amazon.](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b098r38x9h/)

**Functionality and Everyday Use**  
As someone juggling commutes, work, and workouts, I appreciated how portable and versatile these snacks are. They fit into every scenario imaginable—mid-afternoon tea times, a quick energy boost post-yoga, or stolen moments nibbling while stuck in traffic. A serving provides 12 thins, which seems ample for biting down hunger, although the serving size might feel small if you’re particularly ravenous. Trust me, they pair really well with almond milk or coffee, elevating that simple snack break into a moment of zen.  

**Highlights**  
- Delightfully light and crispy texture  
- Made with nutrient-dense ingredients like watermelon seed flour and flax  
- Naturally sweetened for guilt-free snacking  
- Gluten-free and paleo-friendly, catering to specialized diets  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- May not satisfy those expecting rich, traditional chocolate brownies  
- On the pricier side compared to standard cookies  
- The serving size might feel limited for big appetites  

**Nutritional Considerations**  
The brand deserves a nod for transparently listing the simple, nourishing ingredients: watermelon seed flour, cashew flour, sunflower seed flour, and flax. It’s comforting knowing these cookies skip the artificial additives entirely. They checked all the boxes for someone like me trying to balance snacking without guilt. However, those with nut allergies should proceed with caution.  

**Challengers in This Space**  
When it comes to gluten-free and healthy cookie options, brands like Enjoy Life and Partake Foods often pop up as competitors. Enjoy Life leans heavily on allergy-free goodies, catering to a broader spectrum. However, they sometimes miss the mark on flavor, occasionally feeling too safe or bland. Partake, too, has its strengths—like bold flavors—but often lacks the crisp texture of Simple Mills’ Sweet Thins. That being said, the Chocolate Brownie flavor does outshine most rivals in its crunch and depth of taste. Yet, compared to some, its price tag may look intimidating for casual snackers.  

**Quality for Price**  
Is this product worth its cost? Honestly, it depends on your priorities. If eating clean with thoughtfully sourced ingredients is your thing, these cookies are worth every penny. They deliver on taste, healthfulness, portability, and little indulgences without tipping into regretful junk food territory. Sure, they’re not the cheapest treat out there, but the care that goes into crafting them earns my respect—and wallet.

*""At least while I was doing porridge I had a goal...It was called 'getting out'. But now I am out, well, it's a bit of a let down.""*

It's generally regarded as a poor second to the original series, despite starring all the same actors and written by the same team of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and overseen by the same producer Sydney Lotterby, but I enjoyed it a great deal.

It's fascinating for reminding me how brown and grotty late 70's Britain was for us. The food, the decor, the nicotine stained atmosphere. Plus the irony of the newly released Fletcher complaining about the high prices, 10p for a coffee! 

I think part of the problem the series didn't take off its one of its main themes is whilst Fletcher was a respected man in Slade Prison, outside he is just another unemployed middle-aged man with a family who've long since learned to live without him. There's a sadness to most of the episodes as his efforts to prove himself to his children often come undone and he ends up taking out his bitterness by insulting them. In one shocking moment he even physically manhandles his daughter Ingrid during an argument. Viewers want to see Fletcher getting one over the authorities, not bullying his family.

Not only that but his relationship with Godber changes from one of bickering comrades to open hostility, due to Lenny romancing Ingrid. Godber himself is no longer an inexperienced young man trying to better himself but a randy working man who's blokishness in less endearing.

Two highlights of the series are Nicholas Lyndhurst as Raymond, Fletcher's vague moody teenage son who steals every scene he's in, even with the mighty Baker there.  David Swift as Mr McEwan, the well-meaning owner of a hotel who offers Fletcher a job has some amusing moments, reminiscing about his farm job in Africa.

Ending with Fletcher making a firm decision to walk away from a bank job and accept the hard path of being law-abiding, it does give the Stanley Fletcher saga a proper conclusion and there are some good quips along the way.",20,1746443188.0,BritishTV,9,1.0,False

Testing the ChefWave NCM01B espresso machine for a few weeks has been nothing short of an adventure. As a coffee enthusiast always on the lookout for that perfect espresso, I had high hopes for this sleek device. This machine, compatible with Nespresso Original Line capsules, boasts a compact and modern design while promising an Italian-style coffee experience right from the comfort of your home or office. After using it to experiment with various coffee pods and settings, I found it to be a great choice with some notable quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

The black matte finish immediately caught my attention, giving the espresso machine an elegant and stylish appearance. Measuring 12.3""D x 13.6""W x 11.1""H, its compact size fits seamlessly on my small kitchen counter without dominating the space. Despite its lightweight structure, the unit feels sturdy and well-made. The included capsule holder and espresso cups add a touch of convenience. I particularly appreciated the fully automatic operation mode and button interface, which allows for effortless brewing with a simple button press.

**Advantages**  
- The aesthetic adds a professional café vibe to any countertop.  
- Compact dimensions make it suitable for smaller kitchens or offices.  
- Lightweight but durable design ideal for daily use.  
- Ready to go? [Check ChefWave NCM01B price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07s2t5nzv/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**

With a high-pressure 20-bar Italian pump, this machine excels at extracting rich flavors from coffee pods. I often switched between the 1.3 oz Espresso and the 3.75 oz Lungo settings, both of which delivered consistent results. The taste profile was well-rounded, with a robust crema that reminded me of espresso shots served in cozy coffee shops. Starbucks pods worked wonders here, maintaining a smooth and bold finish. However, I noticed Nespresso-branded capsules were slightly watery than expected.

Its fast heat-up time of under 30 seconds stood out. As someone who rushes to get caffeine in before starting work, this was a major plus. The automatic ejection of used capsules into the storage container aids in maintaining cleanliness. The machine's dishwasher-safe components, like the drip tray and water tank, made cleanup straightforward.

**Convenience Features and Programmability**

The programmable brew sizes are particularly useful when catering to different preferences. My husband enjoys a more robust shot of espresso, while I tend to savor a slightly longer brew, and the machine handled our demands admirably. The two-hour automatic shut-off feature ensures I never have to worry about energy wastage if I forget to turn it off. A standby mode also adds to its eco-friendly appeal.

The only hiccup I encountered was when it initially refused to start. After a bit of troubleshooting, I realized the power plug wasn’t fully inserted—user error on my part—but worth noting.

**Disadvantages**  
- Limited compatibility with certain pods produced thinner coffee.  
- Occasional difficulty with the plug firmly connecting for power use.  

**Usability Considerations**

Given my hectic weekday mornings, the ease of cleaning and maintenance is non-negotiable. Thankfully, removing the water tank, drip tray, and capsule container took just seconds. Once disassembled, each of these parts fit perfectly in my dishwasher. Another aspect that stood out to me is its lightweight build. While it’s easy to move around, it sometimes felt less substantial compared to heavier machines in the market. Still, this lightness was beneficial when I needed to reposition it in a pinch.

**Competing Products**

When stacked against similar espresso makers, like the Nespresso Pixie or Essenza Mini, this machine holds its ground in many ways. While both Nespresso machines boast a slightly higher-end finish and refined coffee extraction, they also come with steeper price points. The ChefWave espresso machine delivers comparable performance at a far more affordable cost. A notable downside arises with branding limitations, as it leans heavily toward compatibility with certain capsule types, unlike some competitors offering wider variability.

**Value for Money**

One of my main concerns when shopping for an espresso machine is whether the investment justifies the offered features. This coffee maker ranks high in the value department due to its performance combined with energy-efficient functionality. Comparable models may charge significantly more for similar brew quality and automated features. If you’re budget-conscious but still desire a machine capable of delivering café-like espresso, this could easily be a top contender. For cost-conscious coffee drinkers, I’d definitely say it’s worth the expense.

i did make it to aldi and paul's. the purpose of aldi's was to see about pre-packaged meals, but i wasn't impressed by any of them and/or questioned the multi-syllable ingredients / preservatives, so i just got bread and bananas; neither of which i can get at paul's, where i only go for chicken.

i also decided to immediately cook the chicken when i got home and all shopping/cooking took place between breakfast and lunch which was perfect.

oh yeah that reminds me...

...so, while i was planning to go shopping earlier before breakfast, there really wasn't enough 'runway' (time) to comfortably do so before the next 'horizon' (AKA breakfast).

*side note: i have to mention this bc ever since i discovered my 'idle time blindness', i'm continuing to realize/discover how bad it really is.* 

*the worst yet is when my alarm reminds me to finish my coffee and drink water so that i can floss my teeth.*

*long story short, my brain simply cannot see that, once i'm done with my coffee, i still have 30 minutes to drink my water before flossing my teeth.*

*what does this mean?*

*well, i have a GENERAL problem with task-switching but also i find that i'm savoring my coffee and dragging it out as an excuse for spending more time on reddit.* 

*BUT, the minute i finally acquiesce and finish my coffee and switch to water, i now idle again for 30 minutes which means that i'm back on reddit again bc i can do reddit while i sip my water!! anyway back on topic...*

so i didn't have enough time to floss and shop before breakfast, but i DID have plenty of time to floss and ROCK (practice my set) before breakfast, which i did and it was hugely fun bc i hadn't played guitar since i've been sick and the longer i go without playing the more creative and fun it is.

...and i was able to get all shopping and cooking done before lunch so no harm no foul.

for lunch i grabbed chipotle bc i usually don't carve my chicken until it's chilled and then took a looooong nap.

then i went into 'evening mode', where i pre-hydrated while watching some TV until i felt a bit hungry, after which i cooked pasta including shredding fresh parmesan and carving the chicken while the water boiled and pasta cooked.

then the usual gym > shower > meditate chill. 

it was a good day!

i also experimented with tracking what i actually do bc i'm bothered by my inability to recall events of the day (this was on full demonstration during one of my recent videos where i was trying to recount the good feelings i was having being able to juggle mopping, laundry, running the dishwasher, playing guitar, monitoring the washer cycles, etc.).

...so, in addition to (and probably can be combined with) my 'prescription', i created a 'log':

https://preview.redd.it/i1rjepbh0yye1.jpg?width=2836&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a88e5bc5c8840ae01bb340375621415bf40142f

whew, that was a lot. now for today's board (current):

https://preview.redd.it/2ebmba9muxye1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a4ae055d158ce21db1367032e5e4fd994120364

so, the only thing for today is cooking rice before lunch. 

i also changed some of the text from blue to green bc i don't need/want  'template/routine' things to stand out.

...so you'll notice that i added 'gym' in blue. this is because i want add some more elliptical sessions at the gym since i've increased strength session frequency.

my plan is to keep it simply by just hitting the gym if there's nothing else i need to do. for example, today i have to cook rice so i won't go to the gym. but most days, i'll be able to achieve two-a-day workouts.

*side note: aside from being a lifelong athlete, going to the gym, walking, and other pastimes are very useful to keep me busy (AKA out of trouble, haha) and give my days/evenings structure without having to make any decisions about how to spend my time.*",1,1746442466.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Getting back from the Pangarchulla summit trek, one of the best parts wasn’t just the views, it was brewing fresh coffee in the middle of it all.

Carrying my Aeropress XL, hand grinder, and freshly roasted beans, each morning we’d sit down with a view that no café could match and the kind of silence that lets you actually taste what you’re drinking. 

There’s something special about sipping coffee with numb fingers, looking out at the vast stillness of the Himalayas. It’s not just about the caffeine, it’s about presence. About making time for something slow and deliberate in the middle of a physically demanding experience.",30,1746442219.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

1kf8luj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ania787878/comments/1kf8luj/fjaka_the_croatian_word_that_refuses_to_be/,Fjaka: The Croatian Word That Refuses to Be Translated,"If you’ve ever visited Croatia, you might have heard the word **“fjaka”**. You might have even seen a local staring into the horizon, exuding an aura of supreme relaxation, and thought, *“Wow, they’ve mastered the art of doing absolutely nothing.”*

And you’d be right!

Fjaka is one of those words that **defies translation** — not because it doesn’t have a meaning, but because it’s more of a *lifestyle choice*.

**So, What Exactly Is Fjaka?**

The simplest explanation? **A state of blissful, lazy relaxation.**

But don’t be fooled! Fjaka is *not* just laziness. Lazy people don’t *want* to do anything. Someone in fjaka, on the other hand, **could do something, but chooses not to.** It’s an art form. A spiritual experience. A Dalmatian superpower.

Imagine this:

* It’s a scorching summer afternoon.
* You’re sitting in the shade, with a light sea breeze, sipping a coffee that you’ve been “drinking” for the last two hours.
* You’re too comfortable to move, think, or even blink too quickly.

**Congratulations! You’re in fjaka.**

**Why Is Fjaka Impossible to Translate?**

Because no single English word captures the full fjaka *vibe*.

Let’s examine a few attempts:  
❌ **Laziness** — No! Fjaka is **elevated** laziness. A kind of mindfulness without the effort.  
❌ **Relaxation** — Not quite. You don’t *actively* relax; fjaka just *happens* to you.  
❌ **Meditation** — Sounds too deep. Fjaka requires no mental effort. Thinking too much ruins it.  
❌ **Chilling** — Close, but fjaka is more philosophical. “Chilling” is something you do. Fjaka is something you *become.*

If anything, the closest English translation is:  
**“That feeling when you are too relaxed to function, but in a deeply meaningful way.”**

**Common Situations Where Fjaka Appears**

🔹 **At the Beach:** You lay down and suddenly, **moving becomes a theoretical concept.**  
🔹 **During Coffee Time:** You sit at a café for hours with one espresso, staring at the sea, achieving absolutely nothing — yet somehow feeling accomplished.  
🔹 **After a Meal:** You intended to get up, but instead, you just **exist**.  
🔹 **On a Hot Summer Day:** The sun is shining, the cicadas are singing, and your brain decides that thinking is overrated.

**How to Achieve Fjaka (If You’re Not Croatian)**

Fjaka is deeply ingrained in Dalmatian culture, but non-Croatians can experience it, too! Just follow these simple steps:

1. **Slow down.** No rushing. No productivity. Just *be*.
2. **Find a warm, breezy spot.** The presence of the sea helps but isn’t required.
3. **Drink coffee (or wine, or both).** Sip slowly. Time is irrelevant.
4. **Stare at something in the distance.** Not because you’re thinking deeply, but because it feels right.
5. **When someone asks what you’re doing, answer: “Ništa” (Nothing).** And mean it.

Fjaka isn’t just a word — it’s a *state of mind*. It’s about **enjoying the art of doing absolutely nothing and being totally okay with it.**

So next time someone asks you why you haven’t answered an email, cleaned your apartment, or finished that project, just tell them:

*“Sorry, I was in fjaka.”* 😎

1kf8k25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1kf8k25/my_second_grand_mal_seizure_probably_looking_for/,My second grand mal seizure (probably?) looking for insight,"
I’m (33f) not diagnosed with epilepsy but I have an appointment with a neurologist next week after having what seems to be my second grand mal seizure. The first one was nearly six years ago and I did not seek any kind of medical attention afterwards but let me give some background as I believe it’s important. 

Firstly, I know that no one can diagnosis me, thus, upcoming appointment with a neurologist. I just really want to hear anecdotal information from people and would love to know if my experience sounds familiar to anyone here. 

I apologize in advance for the length here. I don’t expect many to get through it and that’s okay. 

So, in hindsight, I almost felt my first seizure coming, but I chalked it up to a few things. The first being that I was a functional poly-substance abuser grappling with the aftermath of my mother’s (who I was extremely close to) sudden death and my family’s sudden reliance on me (the youngest of three children but the only one with a degree and solid-paying career) as our financial backbone. I started abusing opioids, knowing full well it would end in full blown addiction, because I just could not get on with life while in the throes of the grief I was experiencing. I was already a lifelong depressive and was taking stimulants (Adderall) as I was deemed to be “treatment resistant”.  So I was using amphetamines and opioids daily and benzodiazepines sparingly. I was only “abusing” opioids I suppose. I was taking Adderall as prescribed as well as Xanax but I was buying “oxycodone” from a dealer and I was living in the states at the time and understand now that it’s a near certain that what I was taking was not actually oxycodone but some combination fentanyl and who-knows-what. That said, my tolerence to opioids at the time was sky-high and I was barely feeding my habit at the time of my seizure.

So seizure #1: Age 26. I am a writer and working in an office. I don’t remember why anymore, but for some reason I didn’t have my car and my father had to pick me up from work. He and I got into a horrible screaming fight in the car ride home and I remember everything very clearly, I was not “fucked up” on drugs or outwardly impaired. We pulled up to our house and we were both stepping out of the car, still fighting. The next thing I remember, we are in my father’s kitchen and I am picking up right where we left off in my head. But now he’s REALLY YELLING AT ME. Like he has never yelled at me in my life. He screaming “you’re on drugs! You’re on drugs!” And at this point, no one knew I was an addict so I’m like “what the fuck are you talking about!?” and he very sternly says “you just overdosed in the driveway! Don’t tell me you aren’t on drugs!” 

I suddenly began taking stock of things. My head hurt badly. I don’t remember how we got from outside to inside. I lost time but I didn’t realize it. My father eventually told me that as we stepped out of the car, I just fell straight back, smacked my head on the cement, he came running over, I was foaming at the mouth, convulsing, not conscious, he told me he thought for certain I was going to die. Then, I suddenly regained consciousness, jumped up, ran inside, and picked up our fight where we had left off like nothing had happened. 

This is the important part though. In the weeks leading up to that event, I was having little jolts of electricity hitting my body like lightening. That’s the best way to describe it. The jolts would happen and I’d have a sort of big twitch, often causing me to drop whatever I was holding or to trip if I was walking. They were sometimes noticeable to onlookers and people would show concern. One time I was holding a full iced coffee and just twitched and sent it flying and everyone in the cafe was like…”are you okay?” These happened more and more often and stopped after I had my seizure. I should also mention that my father has a medical background and although he was accusing of ODing, he did say many times that he’s positive I had seizure. That he’s seen countless seizures in this life and he has no doubt it was a grand mal seizure, he just assumed it was brought on by drugs and frankly, I did too. 

I got clean. Life went on. I was never seen medically for it because I assumed it was caused by a mixture of drug abuse and stress. Fast forward to a little over a week ago. 

Seizure #2: I am now a wife and mother to a 1.5-year-old beautiful baby boy. I do not take illicit drugs like before but I am still prescribed amphetamines for ADHD/TRD (Vyvanse now rather than Adderall) and I’m still prescribed Xanax for occasional panic attacks. Never had an adverse reaction to either medication. 

Again, in hindsight, I REALLY should have seen this one coming and in a sense I did and even vocalized it but was stupid and didn’t do anything about it. The lightening strikes had returned. They started slowly and became more frequent over the course of several weeks. The day before my seizure, I told my husband that I was leaving the ATM earlier in the day when one of the major twitches happened and I literally threw all the cash I had in my hands out onto the street and a man walking in the opposite direction stopped to ask if I was okay and it was a bit embarrassing. I sort of nonchalantly said “this is exactly how I felt leading up to my seizure the year my mother died” but because I had assumed that seizure was the result of drugs, I wasn’t worried enough about the lightening strikes returning to do anything about it. I am notoriously bad about looking after my own health, it’s sort of like reverse hypochondria. But I’m a mother now and I need to change. 

My son woke up at 3am and wouldn’t go back to sleep which is unlike him. In fact, it’s only happened once and it was this night. So anyway, he comes into bed with my husband and I. My husband had a big day at work the coming day and was planning on leaving for the office between 5-6am. This bit is told from my husband’s perspective. 

My son and I were lying in bed and my husband was getting ready to leave for the office. He suddenly hears my son screaming in a way he’s never heard before and yelling the equivalent of “mommy” in our language. My husband comes running in and I am foaming at the mouth, convulsing, totally unconscious, eyes rolled back in my head, my son is losing his shit and now so is my husband. He calls our equivalent of 911. 

Again, I lost time. The next thing I know, I’m in bedroom and there are two people I’ve never seen before, along with my husband, standing in the room. They were paramedics. It was about 6am so it was still dark outside and I was very confused. I thought it was nighttime for about an hour into regaining consciousness. 

This is getting very long so I’ll skip some details. I will say that after seizure #2, it hit me what I felt like after my first seizure. Every muscle in my body was in agony like I had been in a car wreck. I was bedridden for the full day following and basically the day after as well. My memory slowly returned and I was able to connect the dots and understand the timeline better. 

When it happened the first time, my father thought I was going to die. I remember very specifically him saying that he said to himself while I was unconscious “you took my wife, now you’re taking my daughter to!?” (Not sure who he was talking to as he’s quite staunchly agnostic). My husband thought I was dead. It was by far the most traumatic thing he has been through so far in his life. He’s a high-anxiety guy to begin with and this scared the shit out of him. He wanted to pay thousands out of pocket to see a neurologist privately the day of the seizure. He worked from home (where I work) for about a week and skipped a big business trip because he’s been terrified to leave me alone. 

If you’ve made it this far, I guess I’m just curious if this sounds familiar to anyone? I remember reading once that if you’ve had more than one grand mal seizure in your lifetime, you meet the criteria for an epilepsy diagnosis but I don’t know if that’s true or if I’m remembering correctly. I’ve been a little bit too scared to start researching until now.

When I arrived, I was used to him not hugging me or even saying hi, so I just walked in, placed my weekend bag down, and went into the living room. He was sitting at his PC, looking at my Facebook account. When he looked up at me, he had a fake smile and said the usual things, pretending that he missed me and noticed that I hadn't called as much anymore.

After about an hour, when I was setting the table, I noticed there were three plates. Confused, I asked him, “Why did you set three plates? It’s just us, right?” He looked at me as if I had insulted his cooking and replied, “Yeah, you know that A (35, his old fling) is coming to join us. I told you, but you must have forgotten.” I felt a surge of anger and replied, “You didn’t tell me anything because you fail to remember the things you talk about.” He just stood there, pretending to be hurt, then punched the counter and said, “She's coming whether you like it or not.”

When A arrived, she looked terrified to see me sitting in the lounge chair drawing. She walked into the kitchen and asked my dad, “Why didn’t you tell me your daughter was here? You said it was just going to be us!” I couldn’t help but laugh inside; he really messed up. Dinner ended up being tense between my dad and me. But   after dinner she went home and was getting late so i went to bed and slept until the morning when i woke up at nine am and sat up and began dressing for the day and opening my blinds & get fresh air before getting  breakfast  while i was eating my toast dad was stressed about something so i look at him

''Are you okay dad you look.... tense'' i said knowing something was up

So after a hour my stepmom arrived with her son (M31) and his sons and i was yet again confused as why the fuck as to why they were there in the first place apparently we were going to the beach to look

And after a drive where we drove to the wrong beach twice i had enough of my dad's pissy mood so on the way home i unleashed hell on my dad '' no wonder my mom left your ass Your so toxic and you know it and yet you do nothing to change it'' i say with venom enough to cut through air then this man starts defending himself saying he slept terrible and what not. I had enough ''You never shut up about you its always you and only you you never even think about how i feel anyway so why i am here listening to you using me as a therapist instead of your daughter !''  there was the silence i waited for all day.

He didn't talk to me for a while until my 19th birthday rolled around and i had recently gotten a bf which is nice and all but my dad didn't know until my 19th birthday when he called and my boyfriend answered because i was busy making coffee he put it on speaker and he starts with how he was not me

This final leg of the trip felt contemplative, both Alex and Carbon a little more quiet as they counted down the hours. Conversely, Neya was practically foaming at the mouth the entire time - Alex’s tendency to leave her messages unread after saying intentionally ambiguous things even got put on hold. She missed them terribly and their group chat was the most convenient way to stay connected.

Neya had been busy too, she wasn’t just sitting around pining for their return. Before they left, they had decided that a room meant for one or two people *temporarily* was indeed too small for three people to live in long term. Neya, doing business as Carbon or Alex - she switched off for practice - had taken care of finding a new place. There were not a lot of options onboard the *Sword*, but she took choosing seriously. Unless she was Alex, then it was somewhat flippant. There had been a bit of work to do on the unit ‘they’ settled on, and furniture to be made, as well. 

But all of that was done now, so she had been sending them a river of pictures and a few videos of pretty much everything in the new house. A lot of them were selfies because she was finding ways to entertain herself. The house was more than four times the size of the old cabin, close to that of his parent’s place. Most importantly? It had a couch. Made on board using synthesized cow leather, she said, and quite comfortable. Apparently there was a TV as well, but Neya couldn’t drape herself over that so no picture of it specifically had been sent.

The *Tamat sa Na’o* traveled for speed on the way back, the Waverider drive pushed to its maximum until reaching Proxima, where it rejoined the Superlight network and proceeded into Sol in a neat and orderly fashion. The captain hadn’t worried about lining up arrival times to play nice, so Alex and Carbon ended up shuffling off the *Tamat* at three in the morning. 

While they had seen Keta and Desaya every day on the way back, those two were still sleeping. Possibly. *They* weren’t expected to depart until a more reasonable hour.

Alex was the only one who actually had somewhere to be.

Carbon got picked up by an absolutely giddy Neya, mostly figuratively, but Carbon’s feet did leave the ground when her Zeshen hugged her with no small amount of ferocity. It was the return to the hearth that Neya had expected the last time Carbon boarded the *Sword*, everyone happy to be reunited. Neya had then turned on Alex and admonished him about his texting habits before almost squeezing the life out of him as well, though the height difference kept him planted on the ground.

Those two departed to tour their new home... or probably just go back to bed, given how sleepy they both looked.

*He* reported to the Xenotechnology lab. There was data to lift from his systems and fix up before they went back to McFadden, and time was of the essence. After a stop at the Berkmann, of course. A few dozen donuts and a carafe of coffee to perk up the early morning before he climbed into the surgical chair. He wasn’t about to arrive empty handed when making a bunch of people work on him before the sun was even supposed to be up.

This was a known habit of his. Admiral Olan met him there while the donuts were printing, had a brief discussion about the retrieval and expected timeline for having the fixed version uploaded. Olan was considerate, tactful, and concerned about Alex’s well being. Listened carefully about the items that Alex wanted them to excise for personal reasons, as well.

Suppose he was in charge of their intelligence arm, he would know the weight this sort of thing could put on a person. Or at least he was concerned about someone with so much access to the Royal family.

They had redone the whole procedure room while he was out. The layout was more streamlined, the walls now white and trimmed with purple to make it feel more like a surgical suite and less like the storage room where they stick needles in your head. He was still sitting face down under a mechanical octopus, but the chair had been massively improved. It was adjustable enough to properly fit him now. It was even pretty comfortable.

“Prince Sorenson? Ground control to Prince Sorenson.” Sergeant Zenshen was crouched beside the surgical chair, looking up at him and shaking his shoulder.

“Wuh?” What was she doing here so soon? They had just started. 

She laughed at his bleary response, very quietly. “There you are. Intel is done, you’re unplugged. Big day today, on the bounce.”

“Right. Winter’s Nadir. Uh, *Kina’o Lamasha*.” He sat up and stretched, feeling a smidge less tired than when he got here as he turned his systems back on. That chair *was* comfortable if he slept through getting all those PIN’s jammed into his wetware. Well, more pressing matters were at hand. Alex stood and wandered over to where he had left all the donuts, running his finger tips over his scalp. Not a drop of blood, which was nice. “Did everything for that get set up?”

Winter’s Nadir was their Solstice celebration and new years mixed into one. The shortest day, and their biggest holiday, it was one of the two days on their calendar that were not grouped with a week. It was where the new year started, the halfway point through winter. A festival, a feast, roving gangs of poets and singers demanding treats or booze to shut up and go away, and yes, gifts for the kids. Sometimes for adults too. Mostly kids.

Alex had given up on the concept of seasons. It was mid-winter on board. Five days ago they had been at an early spring wedding, and back in Berkley it was just turning to summer. What’s the point of keeping track if you were just going to head off somewhere and get a brand new one, entirely out of order?

“Yes. Picked up the shipment you ordered yesterday, and the Empress had already shifted some manufacturing around so there’s a mix of Human and Tsla’o toys. Sorted by age range.” Stana rifled through the remains of the pink boxes beside him, eventually finding a maple glazed donut that worked for her.

“Do we have enough for everyone?” He poured himself a cup of lukewarm coffee and chugged it, then poured himself another and put a little half and half in it this time.

“You gotta go easy on that stuff, man.” She said around a mouth full of donut and shook her head, looking at him like he was mad for shotgunning a cup of black coffee. “Unless you brought a couple of hundred kids with you, yeah. Should have excess, we’ll figure out what to do with it later. Birthdays or something.” 

Alex shrugged. He had a long day ahead and- Hang on. Alex looked up at the clock. Fuck, it’s only *six*? He had a *really* long day ahead. Maybe he would start pacing himself after this. “Good. Pick up went all right? Had a couple of deliveries on Arvaikheer that went down without a hitch too, but I think they’re living a different way of life out there.”

Everything on Arvaikheer had just felt more laid back.

“Got some weird looks and the harbormaster himself came down to check the paperwork, but otherwise it went as smoothly as one can hope when receiving cargo on an alien planet.” Stana was amused as she retold it. As the Tsla’o on board who had the widest experience interacting with Humans, even including Carbon, she was sought after when dealing with them in person. “They were a little perplexed as to why the Tsla’o Empire was receiving a shipment of toys bought by a Confed citizen, so I just hit Marcus - the harbormaster - with a ‘the order is from an ambassador, and it’s for a holiday like Christmas’ and he got it. Pretty close to the truth anyway.”

“Suppose I am sort of like an ambassador.” Not really professionally, but he was sent on behalf of his government. He gave the one technician looking his way a wave and headed for the door. “Good. Carbon and I are taking Leeward, right?”

“Upper leeward, yes. Amalu would not shut up about getting put on that detail. He was so excited about the idea of participating in *Kina’o Lamasha* festivities, it was unreasonable.” Stana considered the coffee for a moment but ended up passing on it before following him out. “So I took him off it.”

Alex looked over his shoulder at Stana as he turned down the stairs. “That’s unexpectedly brutal coming from you.”

“It’s one thing to be excited, but he was *distracted*. He’s young, yet.” She shrugged as she pointed out the difference. “Maybe someone will console him with a quick call and invite him along.”

“Ah. I get it. You have his number?” Hey... Wait. “Isn’t he like two years older than you are?”

“Of course I do. Closer to three years, actually. I would say we’ve been through very distinct experiences recently.” She had a point, there. Amalu had joined up after being evacuated from Schoen, then bounced around several companies and not really trained to do anything specific until recently. Sergeant Zenshen had been thrown into a life or death situation as a refugee, conscripted, and ended up as one of the most skilled Human intermediaries the Empire had in Na’o a few months later, all because some Confed marines had taken her under their wing and given her a crash course in dealing with Humans that weren’t diplomats.

It was a pretty significant difference.

“Fair.” He checked his comm. No messages since one letting him know they had gotten back to the house and where it was located, so they were probably still asleep. Might as well make use of the facilities while he was here. “Have you had breakfast yet?”

“No, the canteens just opened. What are you thinking?”

“Ever had biscuits and gravy?”

“Which biscuits?”

“The... fluffy bread ones.” He gestured for approximate size as he cut over towards the Berkmann. “Not a cookie.”

“Oh, yes. So you put gravy on them as well?”

“Yup. You’ve been missing out.” He dialed in two orders for breakfast, both sans lactose. To go. He already missed the lackadaisical pace of long distance stellar travel.

They ate as they walked. The house was in the Citadel, just a short train-ride away from the xeno lab. It did put them closer to Eleya, as the Citadel was her personal section of the ship, but it was also the highest security area and very centrally located.

Alex had taken a shower on the *Tamat* but was dressed for getting his implants worked on, not being a proper prince on the big holiday. He didn’t want to go to the new place, because then he’d want to take a nap and then bed was *right there*, but he needed to look the part.

Fortunately, when he poked his head into the main room, it was what he’d think of as a living room. The bed was no longer *right there*, because they didn’t live in an extended stay hotel anymore. He could ditch Zenshen somewhere comfortable, not ask her to stand around in the entryway. She could even make use of the facilities if she needed as the kitchen was there as well, and the bathroom down the hall past the office.

Narrow stairs led up to the bedroom loft. As he suspected, Carbon and Neya were still asleep, but a quick check of the alarm said they were set to get up at seven. Perfectly reasonable.

In historical times, or anything over two years ago, the traditional outfit for *Lamasha* was heavy. Literally. Unless there was a blizzard, your ass was going outside and standing amid the celebratory bonfires where they cooked and ate and carried on. If there was a blizzard, everything just got rescheduled to next week. Recent celebrations had been somewhat subdued, understandably.

They tended towards bright colors. Yellow and orange for the sun and fire, greens for the coming growing season. Light blue for the sky, but that was a loaded color right now with Schoen’s sky being a dirty gray. None of it was really Alex’s preferred color scheme. He would love to just wear his black suit again, even though it was getting played out. Carbon had given him a look when he suggested it. Inappropriate for this moment, apparently.

So that’s how he ended up with a purple suit. Used in medical fields because it was perceived as being clean, it also was representative of wisdom and bravery. The last one was very heavily emphasized in recent years.

Neya, being a professional, already had their outfits laid out on the new, incredibly wide dressing table.

It was cut in the rustic style - no sleeves and very little adornment - so he was just wearing a dark purple vest over a burnt orange *daman*, which was still not his style but the colors worked well enough that he didn’t feel stupid wearing it... Even if it was better suited to halloween. Just kept the black engineering-rated pants he’d put entirely too early this morning, as it fit the ‘working man’ motif pretty well.

Carbon had the same outfit he did, for all intents and purposes. Same colors, same vest. Interestingly, Neya went with a black vest with a red *daman*.

They were gonna have a chat about that.

Him and the Sergeant hung out and drank a lot of deep tea while he called Amalu - yes, he *would* be coming along - and made some breakfast. Keeping himself active so he didn’t just go back to sleep. Carbon was particularly pleased to find food waiting for them, and Neya squeezed the life out of him again. Looked like she was about to go in for a kiss as well, but held back with Stana over in the living room.

They were underway by eight and heading to the aft promenade, picking up the rest of their group a half hour later - Amalu, Keta, Desaya, and a couple more members of their security team - at the closest maglev station.

It was already packed. Food carts cooking, groups of people socializing, the drone of a hundred conversations filling the large social area. No roving singers yet, thankfully. It actually pushed Alex’s translator past what it could handle, a warning chime playing as a notification popped up to let him know all the processors were in use.

He wondered to himself if this wrecked the spyware’s ability to collect data. Too much noise to filter from the signal. Alex was pleased at the very thought - he'd send intel a message about it later.

The energy in the promenade was shockingly positive. The discussions he was getting translated trended towards a couple of specific events - the Namara shipyard, their largest yard before the Cataclysm, had come back up to full production. It used to sit as the counterweight to their space elevator, which had collapsed, so the refit and repair operation had been a massive undertaking.

There was still a lot of discussion about the strike against the Makalva pirate clan, as well. Everyone liked that, even if it wasn’t *new* news anymore. Over two thousand citizens freed after everything was said and done, and some high ranking collaborators rooted out by the Empress’ brother on the frontier. A win for everybody except the pirates.

Both were things the Confed had been involved with. There was much less hesitation when people saw him now, they were less guarded when the Human head sticking up over the crowd bobbed into view. It had taken some time, but evidence of Humanity’s earnest intention was finally starting to show up in ways that were visible.

There was also a lot of food. He ended up with a paper sleeve full of those cinnamon roll things, but actually bite size, still hot from the oven and a tart, alcoholic cider simply by slowing down to look in front of eager vendors. It was early to start drinking, yes, but Alex and Carbon had one more thing on the docket before the holiday really kicked off for them.

They pardoned themselves shortly before nine, as did Sergeant Zenshen. They had a meeting to attend. A short walk away from the promenade, back to The Hidden Bloom. The security in the hall was a little more obvious this time, soldiers in regular uniforms with the mark of Eleya’s Royal Guard flanking the entry. Everyone got a scan before they were allowed in, and Alex’s food got a second scan to make sure he wasn’t drinking acid or napalm.

The door Alex had wrecked between the lounge and the dining room had been fixed, which was a load off his mind. It currently sat open, a handful of military personnel already loitering in there. He recognized Olan and Colonel Lhenan, talking over tea.

Eleya was alone in the lounge, save for the waitress she had cornered. The same waitress as last time, actually, standing in the corner next to the silver bar cart and mixing a drink. They appeared to be having a very amiable conversation.

The Empress joined them after she had her *kalaatan* in hand. Apparently holidays were for day drinking. She smiled, wide and genuine, a hint of a bow leveled towards the trio. “Good Nadir, everyone. Welcome back to the *Sword of the Morning Light*. Your presence has been sorely missed.” She was in a fantastic mood, the sharpness Alex had come to expect from her nowhere to be found in her warm greeting.

“Happy *Kina’o Lamasha*.” Alex popped another spice roll into his mouth and reached out to clink their drinks together. “Good to see you too.”

A quiet, nearly fully contained laugh came from the corner the waitress was still in as she cleaned up the cart.

“Really.” Eleya’s initial exasperation at Alex’s unrelentingly casual behavior was short lived, a thin smile curling up the corner of her muzzle. “I understand you are starting to come into your role, young prince. I look forward to when you embrace it fully.”

“Don’t get your hopes up.” No matter how far into his role as a prince he got, or even if he someday became Emperor... He would have the exact sort of behavior you’d find at a backyard barbecue ready to go just for her. They would be bros, forever.

The waitress must have thought he was killing it because there was another muted sound of amusement from her as she hustled off to the dining room.

She smiled softly. “I feel I must. I am still appreciative of your actions. Tanse and Lema both approve of you, as it happens. They had been... cautious. I could not show them your truth, after all.” 

Did Eleya just turn that around on him? Damn it. He took a sip of cider. “Time will tell, I guess.”

“Their help was invaluable, and very necessary. Please pass my thanks to them both along when you have the opportunity.” Carbon said, just before she stole his beverage. Lifted it out of his hand and started drinking it like he wouldn’t mind. He didn’t, but it was the premise of the thing.

“I speak with Tanse nightly now, so it will be done very soon.” She turned to Carbon specifically. “How have you fared with your father?”

“It was good. He is apologetic and I believe he speaks in earnest. He is also very unsettled, but he is accepting help and is well supported.” She paused and drank half of what was left in one go. “I do find the holes in his memory to be worrisome.”

Alex stole his cider back. If she was going to be swilling it, she could get her own.

Eleya raised an eyebrow, but did not comment on the pace of Carbon’s morning drinking. “I understand that Kaleta has found her path again. It is good, I did not like seeing her in such a sorry state.”

“Same.” Alex still didn’t like Kaleta very much, her first impression was pretty strong. Yes, it was good she wasn’t about to start spewing slurs and advocating to have him shipped back to Earth, and actually able to do her job. Also good that she was under Tanse’s eye for the time being.

Carbon nodded. “It is so.” 

“While we are on the subject of Zesehn...” Eleya plucked a small object from her *daman* and held it out to Carbon. Gray metal, half the width of her palm and only a centimeter thick. “*Zetalo* Varasha sent this for Neya using the most secure channels she has access to. I assume it will be safe in your care?”

“Yes, of course.” She took the case, the top surface embossed with Eleya's sigil above a depression for a thumbprint scanner. “It is keyed to her?”

“It is. She said it was data related to an inquiry Neya had made to her a few weeks ago. Personal among their kind. I have not had intel verify that, I hope I do not need to.”

Carbon shook her head. “She has had much on her mind lately, most of it related to the recent expansion of her duties.” She gave a nod to Alex.

“Is that why I felt like Varasha was trying to suss me out the whole time we were on Na’o Gateway?” He assumed that if the verdict was bad, Varasha would have just sent an email telling Neya to get out, not... whatever was on that storage device.

“It is likely. She is crafty, more careful than other *Zetalo*.” Eleya approved of that, of course.

Alex thought she couldn’t have been too crafty, as he clocked her doing that, but he stopped before it turned into actual words. “Must have passed the test, then.”

“So it seems.” She gestured to the dining room. “Come, we have a few items to discuss. Some news that is related to you, specifically.”

It was a pretty small crowd, a commander and lieutenant that Alex didn’t recognize the only other folks on hand, some snacks and deep tea already laid out around the table. The waitress, who Alex was starting to think was not simply a waitress, secured all the doors behind them.

“I will attempt to make this short, it is a holiday. Gold protocols. An update, as the Prince and Princess have not been informed - the Makalva raid was an unmitigated success, and the more we dig into the spoils the better it gets.” Eleya stood at the head of the table, where she had sat last time they were here. “Governor Madala in particular had been dumping Human donated supplies with the express intent of having it salvaged by the clan. In turn, they used them extensively - we have cleared three sites already set up for habitation, and are working on ensuring another three are safe before allowing civilian crews to overhaul them.”

“At least somebody was putting that stuff to use.” Alex might have been a little salty about it. Nothing about the Tsla’o frontier sounded good, but it was an extreme measure by desperate people.

Eleya gave him a nod of recognition, despite the sarcasm. “Indeed. While it seems counterintuitive, this is proof that the supplies work, and they work well. The Makalva clan grew at an unprecedented rate and remained strong because of them. That they were a torn claw for my Navy for so long is evidence of just how useful these will be to our citizens.”

“I am pleased that some good is coming of this.” Carbon chimed in.

“As am I. The next order, your return to the Artifact. Plans have not changed, you will be returning to McFadden station in two days time, and then shipping out to the Artifact the day after. Per our previous plans, you will conceal your relationship from the crew involved. They should not know that Carbon is related to me, merely an accomplished engineer. And while I believe most of the Confederation is fair-minded and well intentioned, it has become clear that the ONI is not. *They* violate their own citizens and our treaties alike. I know you will not ‘play favorites’, Alex, and I would prefer that you not be replaced because someone else finds that trait distasteful.”

“Yeah, I got it.” He still wasn’t looking forward to it, but the deal was that both sides got access to whatever they found in the Artifact, if they found anything at all. Eleya was right, he wouldn’t play favorites. That was the agreement.

Carbon tipped her head. “By your sight.”

“There is a recommended packing list the Confederation has sent along that will be forwarded to you both. Apparently the seasons have changed.” Eleya did not elaborate on that before pushing on. “The last item... Obsidian protocol.”

She paused, looking around the handful of people in the room for recognition of that change. Presumably the scan at the door was enough proof that they were who they said they were. A rather solid bit of evidence this wasn’t simply a private dining room at Eleya’s favorite restaurant, as well.

Once happy that they were all on board, she turned her attention to Alex. “The intrusion that you uploaded has - what is that term you kept using? ‘Phoned home’ just in the last few days. It is currently on an infrastructure-grade network in the Western hemisphere of Mars named *Kay Oh Emm*. Does that happen to sound familiar at all?”

Alex shook his head. “Just the letters K-O-M? Not immediately, no. If it was in all capital letters it could be an acronym, but that also doesn’t mean anything to me. Sure would have been nice if it had gotten loose on tharsis.oni.navy.mil or something.” If they were doing stuff that violated at least a few laws, an appropriately named network would be the dumbest place to handle that illicit data.

“Ah, unfortunate. Either way, this ping raises the next question. It currently sits quietly, avoiding doing anything that might draw attention. If we want more data, it will have to begin taking more noticeable measures.”

Eleya had said that she would leave the choice of what to do with it up to him. “It can’t be traced back to you?”

“If that network only handles data from you, then yes, it could be. The amount of storage and traffic it has recorded indicates that site is a very busy *satalo* warren.”

Alex absolutely didn’t get that idiom on the first pass. “Well, fire it up then. Minimally invasive. I don’t want... I don’t want anything important damaged.” That wasn’t true. Alex really *did* want something important damaged, but would hold his desire for retribution until it wasn’t just blindly striking at unknown systems.

“By your sight, young prince.” She bowed just a little bit at him. “And if something should come to light when you are out of contact?”

“You remember the discussion we had on the GX8?”

A pleasant smile crossed Eleya’s lips. “Of course. It was enlightening.”

Alex trusted her a little less when she smiled like that. It was something that a normal person would do, so when she did it, it had to be manipulative. “With what I said in mind, use your own discretion.”

“So be it.”

“Minimally invasive.” He reiterated, just to make sure that part was clear for everyone.

“It is understood, young prince.” Eleya was gracious about it, very much a surprise. “Unless you have anything else to add, that covers what we were to discuss. Anyone?”

A quick glance around the table found that no, nobody had anything they wished to add.

“Then you are dismissed... Do have a good holiday.” The probably-not-just-a-waitress opened the door to the lounge, and the naval personnel disappeared after an appropriate amount of bowing and holiday well-wishing.

Carbon hung around for a moment, so Alex did too. “Eleya...” Carbon started, words faltering before she could get them out.

Eleya had been keeping an eye on them, sipping her drink across the table, but her attention was instantly focused on Carbon. “Yes, dearest niece?”

Carbon held up a hand and leaned in to Alex, speaking to him stretching up on her toes to whisper in his ear. “I would like to invite her along.”

He had not hidden that Eleya was not his favorite. Carbon was well aware that there was not a small amount of animosity on his end that he tamped down and sat on because she was the Empress... and because he did want Carbon to have good relationships with her family. Alex responded in a similarly quiet voice. “Sure, the more the merrier, right?” He had not yet said it out loud, but he did kind of like Eleya sometimes. In those moments where she was earnest, she did feel like family. She was squarely in their corner.

But there was always the matter of trusting her after their initial meeting scratching at the back of his mind.

Carbon slipped her hand into his, turning back to her aunt. “Eleya. I do not know what you have planned for today, but I would like to invite you to the gift-giving event we will be hosting later.”

She set her drink down and leaned back in her chair, caught off guard by that. The Empress took a moment to compose herself, blinking back tears. “I would like nothing more.”

Yes, the concept of winter is 'alive' by their language. While other seasons get an -o suffix, only winter gets the glottal stop. Many consider it beautiful, some even enjoy the quiet temporary isolation that it can bring... But one cannot forget that it is capricious, demanding, and how easily it will take a life.

1. Buy a grind by weight grinder for $700.
2. Buy a 'bean cellar' from Amazon for $30, which are those dosing tubes with an air tight seal that you can pre-prepare 12x18g tubes of coffee ready to add them to the grinder.

Option number 2 seems like the more sensible solution at this point in my relatively new  espresso timeline.

Apparently, in this society of COWARDS and uncommitted people, being genuine, vulnerable, intense and honest can be a problem to find a partner, this is the sad reality. There is a real disregard for “the vulnerable” and displays of “weakness” even if they mean love and respect for the other person can be unattractive.

In any case, I was corresponding with a former student (20 years old) who had shown clear signs of interest, in her emails she said things like “I feel very comfortable talking to you and I don't know why”, “I feel you are special”, “I like that a person like you sees me like that and sees potential in me”, “I hope you don't consider me too intense”, “I hope to see you soon”, “we could meet for a coffee when you come back here'”.

A lot of things like that, I am not going to quote them all but I think it gives a clear sign that there were signs of interest, and also according to her, she did not find my messages emotionally overwhelming....

Well then. I sent her a rather long email (a bit longer than usual) and her reply was....

RADIO SILENT, it's been 10 days. Just shortly after I was going to see her again....

I can't say she hadn't already given little signs of disconnection but the reality is that the last email was a clear sign of “love bombing” and she responded the same day I wrote her... then I wrote her the email I said, the next day, and WHAM, it was over....

1kf8dsw,https://i.redd.it/ue9yja8erxye1.jpeg,What you love about VTMB and what worries you about 2,"Disclaimer: This is going to be a long boring-ass post because I tend to ramble and I've had a coffee and it's sunday. I've had these opinions and thoughts in my mind for so long that I just need to vocalise them. Also, this isn't a Negative-Nancy post, in no way am I trying to create distrust of the talented team working on VTMB2. We all know the history of VTMB2 and I don't think anyone would envy the position they are in. Working on a game that has been cancelled more times than a tennis match in English weather.

But I've been lurking here awhile and I just want to put my thoughts down and see how others are preparing themselves for the sequel.

  
I only played the game for the first time a year and a half ago after getting a Steam Deck and finally catching up on all the PC imsims that I'd missed and to say that VTMB entered my top five games of all time would be an understatement. Even with all the flaws, even when it's at it's most broken and most frustrating - VTMB offered me an experience that no other game has come even close to.

Obviously it offers the usual, vampire roleplay and the usual imsim tenants like hacking, espionage and emergent gameplay. But frankly, I've gotten that from a lot of games. But what VTMB gave me was something that I unfortunately don't think can be replicated and it's no fault of the VTMB2 dev's that they won't be able to give me the sequel I dream of in my head.

I'm going to break it down into two separate groups, one technical and the other aesthetic. Lets start with technical because it will be shorter:

* The incredible facial animation of the source engine - this is a huge one and it's no fault of the team that their animation won't be on par because the entire industry ignored the starting pistol Valve fired and has seemingly swept all the research and tech they were heralding under the rug. The industry is clearly not interested in realistic expressions/performances. No engine as far as I am aware, can offer even slightly what the source engine did in regards to every NPC being able to emote and instantly become affable and humanized (this is kind of important for a vampire game). But I guess we will see when the game releases but I would be astonished if they reach beyond the usual Bethesda lipsync and blinking.

  
Now onto the long list, aesthetics:

* This is a huge one - the 2000's LA goth and industrial scene. I grew up during the 2000's and had a sibling who was going through this exact stage during their teens. New Rock boots, blond streaks in black hair (think Tiffy from Raw Time). It was a wonderful time where goth was becoming commercialized due to artists like Marilyn Manson and the album Fallen by Evanescence (including movies like Blade, Underworld and shows like Angel). Usually the commercialization of a subculture is a negative thing, but it worked so well with VTMB because it perfectly portrayed LA during that time. A hedonistic, dark and doomer mindset that was completely without pathos or merit. The death of the 90's grunge scene and the start of the vapid goth club scene. An MTV's broadcast of the Armageddon.  A Hot Topic Apocalypse. Obviously all of this is captured with impeccable music and fashion choices. Rik Schaffer's OST also perfectly captured that late night LA mood with his incredible dub/trip-hop ost. Helping you feel like you're travelling a city that never sleeps but the only crime is petty interpersonal office-vampire drama.
* The colourful graphics and art direction - this is a huge one. From everything I've seen of the new builds, VTMB looks to be very dark visually and I don't mean dark in themes, I just mean the lighting in general. VTMB was clearly made with comic-books in mind, the entire look of the game is filled with vibrant colours (and I don't just mean neons like modern games seem to overuse). It just generally has a cartoony look to everything. Whilst the game was made during films like Blade and Underworld, it absolutely did not try to emulate that visual style and instead went with an appealing bright look which made exploring the city a delight. The only time it went more realistic was during the sewer segments etc and I'd say that was more due to the source engine's included photo textures more than anything. The costume design is a clear representation of this, especially the female cop uniform. It's a wacky world of darkness.
* This is a controversial one and is probably the one that no studio would ever really try to replicate and thats the (as Grimbeard would say) \*smelly boy humor\*. This was the age of South Park, Jackass, Daria, Invader Zim and male-centric internet subcultures nurtured through sites like SomethingAwful, Newgrounds and hanging out with your friends shooting the shit on IRChat. To put it lightly... Guys being guys. This game for better or worse, is absolutely filled to the brim with male-gaze and early 2000's frat-boy humor. Whilst I found some of the humor in this day and age to be a little eye-rolling, it absolutely hit that nostalgic part of me that grew up during that time and it's a very important part of the game. From the radio show adverts straight out of GTA 3 to the emails in the cybercafe. It all helps give the world this strange feeling of parody - again, VTMB isn't grounded. It's a very wacky game that feels more like Futurama than King of the Hill (I mean, Bender is even in the game for fucks sake).
* The writing - This one is tough because the writing in VTMB is both incredibly complex and personable but can also be very immature and hollywood-ized. Personally, I love this. I love this mix of petty politics regarding rules and grudges that have festered for centuries, passed down from an old-guard from so long ago that the people who are inheriting them may not even understand what began these conflicts in the first place. I love that we have this complex-writing and then we have a scene where we plant a bomb inside of a sarcophagus like we're in a fucking Tex Avery cartoon. The brujah for instance are essentially college-commies who watched a documentary on Che Guevara and listen to Black Flag whilst smoking weed. But why is that writing bad? Sure it's surface level, but that was the point. They were the 'good guys' but they were still naive. I don't think simplistic takes on politics should always be seen as bad writing. There's songs written by a teenager that sound like Blink-182 and then theres songs written by a teenager that sound like Alkaline Trio. Angst can result in engaging writing as long as it's self-aware of that and written by someone who can write from multiple perspectives and not just their own.

  
OK, so why did I write all that? Basically, when I played VTMB I fell in love with it because it's crystalised so perfectly a time in place of both tech, art and culture. It both parodied it and paid homage to it in equal measure and it's perfect. It took the VTMB lore and used it to explore a culture in LA that was on the verge of imploding (leading way to the emo/scene era music wise and the indie-tumblr generation. Soon the sexy-goth school girl outfit, flames T-Shirt and cargo pants would be swapped out with a sweater-vest and shoulder bag. Invader Zim tee's would be replaced with My Chemical Romance Tee's and so on. I fell in love with it's well written and wonderfully performed characters and it's wacky sense of humor and late night city atmosphere. It felt like a show that would air on Adult Swim.

Can the sequel even begin to offer me anything close to this?

No, I don't believe so. From what I've seen, VTMB2 looks to be more Vampire the Masquerade than Bloodlines. What do I mean by this? What I mean, is that Bloodlines was it's own game. If it didn't have WOD lore, I still believe they would have made a game incredibly similar to Bloodlines. They clearly wanted to capture that culture and VTM slot into that incredibly well. But in the end, VTMB is a Troika game and the only way VTMB2 could be something special imo is if they took the risk to really drill-down into a subculture and exploit it.

I don't even care if it's a subculture that I'm familiar with or a fan of. But I'm finding that the best games I'm playing today are the ones written by people with a nostalgia for the subculture they were or are a part of. I recently played Corn Kidz 64, an incredible platformer that reeks of mid 2000's Hot Topic lolsorandom XD subculture that came about from sites like Deviantart etc.

  
VTMB2 needs to have an identity outside of VTM or it would just be another dark vampire game that plays like Dishonoured and reads like a Anne Rice and Twitter had a baby.



So how would I have made VTMB2? Well I would have set it a few years after VTMB1 and just completely went all in on that mid to late 2000's nostalgia. The time of HDTV's, screamo and Juno-hipsters who listened to Devandra Banhart and had a blogspot that no one read.  


TL;DR:  I hope VTMB2 is about emo kids or something.",28,1746441361.0,vtmb,9,0.85,False
1kf8dql,https://i.redd.it/20y04q5pyxye1.png,"[Any Literacy] The Wilsons, The Detective and The Spies Episode 2.5; Contacted (Pls read body, and also Villain OCs preferably)","Your (villain) OC was enjoying a nice and peaceful lunch, and to celebrate a surprisingly good day so far, they decided to eat at a small time cafe. As they enjoyed their lunch, they found the cafe was strangely… empty. The atmosphere was thick with a deafening silence. The clock on the wall ticked softly and quietly, not intending on interrupting the quiet. The barista stood at the counter, awaiting for other customers to come in. He muttered underneath his breath, a tiresome look on the barista’s face. “Bloody hell, where the hell are the customers? This place is usually busy this time of day.” He thought aloud, speaking with a small bit of sass in his voice, and annoyance seeping into every syllable. He didn’t seem to mind that your OC was a dangerous villain, even occasionally glancing at them and giving a soft and friendly smile.

Suddenly, Your (Villain) OC and the barista hear small bells ringing loudly, slicing the silence like a knife through butter, as someone enters the cafe. The man’s skin was grey and rotting, as he sat at the counter next to your OC. His hands were clean, however he only had 3 fingers on each hand, including thumbs. He spoke firmly, as the barista walked away to the kitchen. “I’ve been looking around for you.” the man’s skin says, the shiny bit of copper at the top of his scalp glistening in the light. The barista returns, his face now covered by a blue disposable face mask. “I’ll take a couple cups of black coffee.” The man says, as the barista nods and is handed some cash. The barista places the cash into the cash register, as he goes to make the Grey Man his cups of joes.

The man turns back to your OC, a crooked smile on his face. Judging from his expression, he has a wicked plan in mind. “I’m willing to offer you a deal, if you’re interested, of course. I’d say it would be worth your time.” He offers, as he held his hands together. His red eyes pierced Your OC’s soul, observing their reactions closely. He fidgets with the stitches over his mouth, as he his sinister expression remains. He awaits Your OC’s response, patiently waiting for his coffee to arrive.

How does your OC react?

No Killing, but fighting is allowed, just no OP OCs, only city level or below

I'm writing this post now that the dust has settled a bit. So, six months ago I started working at Lidl (a company that supposedly pays the best wages and “cares” about its employees – LOL). After six months of working there, these are my impressions and traumas from Lidl...

You work 10-hour shifts, sometimes starting as early as 4 a.m. That alone isn’t the biggest problem – the real issue is the management, who treat regular workers like slaves. While they smoke and drink coffee, everyone else has to carry goods and do all the work. That was the first thing that really bothered me.

Then there’s the rude behavior – constant belittling, swearing, and insulting of workers. I witnessed one of the managers yelling and insulting a new colleague so badly that she was brought to tears. Every month we get new employees, who don’t even get the chance to find their footing before being let go. Very few last more than a month or two.

The salary is €800 net – nowhere near what people say. The seasonal work is better paid, but has even more working hours and far too few days off. The slogan “Lidl cares for its employees” is a complete lie and scam. People burn out on that job, become anxious – a colleague who recently quit was constantly taking anxiety meds (Normabel) until she finally left as well.

So, if you care about your mental health, stay far away from Lidl.",9,1746441341.0,lidl,7,0.77,False

                                                            A long day. 

Wasn’t much to do, thankfully, in the office today—the ever-exciting paperwork and filing followed by the never-ending busy work that kept Nick’s mind in check. No missing persons reports or anything unusual (or updates on Tommy). The work companion jabs back and forth made the day go by, and Nick also made sure to fix the name plaque outside the door.

As the workday finally came to an end, Nick grabbed his gear and headed to the door.

“Hey Nick, is everything ok? You seemed a bit off today.”

“I’m good, I just didn’t get any sleep last night.” (How could he with the little road stop “Encounter” he made on the way home?)

“Some bad news in the envelope?” Adam asked.

“Just something I gotta take care of.”

Adam just looked at his friend and co-worker. “Just please be careful, and don’t do anything stupid. I have enough missing persons reports to fill out without adding to the pile.”

Without looking back, Nick waved over his shoulder at his friend. “You know me.”

“I know; that’s what worries me,” Adam said before Nick walked out of the office and closed the door.

""How'd she get that ID? Does that mean her and that creature are connected?""

“I’m not sure what to expect on this, but I better go prepared for anything and grab a few things before I leave,” Nick says to himself while heading to the evidence and munitions hold.

Any reluctance was shoved to the side as his resolve hardened. If this was a trap, he wasn’t about to be caught off guard. He had questions, and tonight he was going to get answers, no matter the risk.

Being a detective had its perks; it gave him access to the evidence locker without needing to bother anyone who had access to both the munitions closet and evidence storage.

Swiping his ID, he was greeted with a green light followed by a *fuchunk* from the door. Nick heads to the locker that had some confiscated weapons and ammo from some would-be bank robbers that the special tactics and rescue force took down a couple of weeks ago. 

The only reason they still kept the items in evidence was because they still had a few members of the group that gave up instead of fighting to the death and needed what evidence was left for the court case. Luckily, the ammo was plentiful, and none of the other guys picked through the boxes of armor-piercing .45 ACP, although the boxes of 9mm were missing—not that he cared at the moment.

There were a couple of folks he knew who would pick the cabinet, probably to go blow up pumpkins and beer kegs on a Friday night with heavy drinking involved.

Nick went through his gear with practiced efficiency, checking and rechecking to ensure he grabbed only what he needed—and some of what he hoped he wouldn’t. He added boxes of armor-piercing rounds to his bag. Experience had taught him that preparation meant survival, and tonight, he planned to be ready for anything. Nervous energy tugged at him, but he pushed it back to the darkest reaches of his mind. Whatever awaited him at the playground, he wouldn’t be going in blind.

He stuffs the boxes into his shoulder bag, then before closing the locker, he notices some stubby compact cylinders. He picks one up to inspect it—*P/N 1750-002 Stun Grenade*. “This looks like a good backup just in case.” He grabs a few, then closes the locker back up and makes sure the rest of the evidence is secure.

Nick leaves the police station, still having a few hours to spare. “Well, I’ve got time, maybe I’ll head to Frank’s for a bit, get a bite to eat, and some coffee,” Nick says to himself. He starts thinking of a plan on his way, playing out different scenarios in his head of what possibly to expect.

A few minutes later, he pulls into Frank’s and parks to the side of the building, then goes inside to the register.

“Nick! Back so soon?”

“Hey Elis, did I miss any excitement?”

“Oh yes, you missed the Friday extravaganza,” Elis replied, dripping with sarcasm. “Frank even bawled out one of the girls for daydreaming and burning the burgers, you know, the usual excitement.”

“Egads! Burnt beef, you say? That’s, dare I say, a felony! I have half a mind to take her in right now if I wasn’t off the clock!” Nick retorted, matching her sarcasm. They both started laughing.

“Y’all keep it down out there, or I’m gonna have to charge you for all that fun and excitement you’re having!” a voice hollered from the kitchen.

“Hey, Frank!” Nick hollered back to the kitchen area.

Elis asked if he wanted the usual—(two eggs over easy, bacon, and a biscuit).

“You know, im feeling adventurous this evening, how about a number two with extra mushrooms, add bacon.”

“Hey, Frank! One mushroom Swiss burger, add bacon, extra shrooms, with a side of fries! Oh, and Frank"" Elis looked over at Nick  giving him a wink before turning and hollering back to frank in the kitchen. ""Nick said to make sure not to burn the burger this time.” 

“Got it,” Frank replied.

“Another crack like that and I’ll have Maggie cook your burger, Nick!” (Maggie was already in hot water for the beef offense earlier.)

“Anything else, dear, before you antagonize the cook any further?” Elis joked with a grin.

Nick shook his head at Elis. “You know, if he poisons—or worse, burns—my burger, I’m blaming you, right?”

“Burn the burger, maybe. Poison one of our best customers? I doubt it. Besides, he knows he’d be sleeping on the couch for a month if I had to help him hide the body,” she said jokingly.

Nick paused for a moment, patting his pockets. “Dang it, I must’ve left my cigs at work. Could you give me another pack of Reds?”

“Sorry, hun, that was the last pack you bought this morning.”

“Ugh, fine. Any Lucky Strikes?”

“Yeah, two packs of those left; the truck’ll be in tomorrow.”

“I’ll take the two packs of Luckies then. Oh, a cup of coffee also.”

She handed the cup and cigarettes to Nick while he gave her the money. She handed him his change back.

“I’ll let ya know when the burger’s ready, hun.”

“Thanks, ma’am,” Nick said, turning to go get his coffee. He poured a cup and put it at a table on the outside patio, out of sight. He went back and got his food from Elis. Heading back to the table, tray in hand, he sat down, pulled out the boxes from his bag, and then pulled the magazines from his holster and gun. 

He takes a sip of his coffee and starts flicking the bullets from the magazine to his palm, then replacing the hollow points with the armor piercers. Once the magazines were swapped, he put his hollow points in the box that he got the armor piercers out of, put his magazines back in the pouches and gun, then re-racked the round and set the safety.

After finishing his burger and fries, he lights up a cigarette and sips his coffee. When finished, he tossed his trash out and brought his tray back to Elis.

“Thanks, ma’am, that was really good.”

“Anytime, Nick, you know where ta find us.” They smiled and waved at each other as he walked to his bike.

I’ve studied in both Oujda and Rabat, and I can definitely say there’s a big difference—especially when it comes to how waiters in coffee shops treat you. In Nador, it's honestly shitty. It’s not about racism or anything like that(i think its even worser if you speak darija), it just feels like there’s this collective anger that’s been growing over the years.

But what I don’t get is: if a lot of Moroccans are struggling in similar ways, why is the attitude so different from one city to another? Why do some places still manage to stay warm and welcoming, while others feel so bitter?",8,1746441021.0,Morocco,7,0.91,False

Dear diary...

I had been a smoker since I was 14. We used to meet up during school breaks to buy a pack of Winston cigarettes for about $1.50. After that, I moved on to rolling tobacco. I rolled. Day after day. I would catch myself, when out of cigarettes, digging through the trash for old cigarette butts to crumble and roll one more. Now I am 28.

44 days ago, I smoked my last cigarette, and I keep telling myself: ""You're not losing anything."" I haven't had any cravings. I've cut down on food, I stay active, and so on. I enjoy walks, coffee, spending time with friends... I've even started swiping left on girls on Tinder if their profile says “smoker.”

So yeah. Stranger, if you’re reading this—

JUST GO FOR IT

P.S. I also drank alcohol without smoking. It is possible.

I let out a lethargic groan, my head pounding furiously as I rolled over on a bed softer, larger and more comfortable than I remembered mine to be.

Ring. Ring.

That incessant ringing of a cell phone nearby was practically blasting my ears to bits. I felt around for my phone, wanting to answer it but my hand came to rest on a hard, naked chest.

I froze, my thoughts and heartbeat coming to a standstill, only to start again even more ferociously as my head swam with memories from last night while I tried to place why I was in bed with someone else, a man from the look of things.

I splayed my fingers and coasted down the chest. Too smooth and broad to be Kevin, my on again, off again boyfriend I usually hooked up with when I needed my fix.

RRRRING RRINGGG RRR-

The annoying ringing was cut short by a pissed off voice demanding in a heavy accent; “What is it?”

My eyes flew open, my heart stilling at the deep, husky voice that was unfamiliar until yesterday… Last night to be precise. Hot humiliation and ice cold fear warred in my chest, my heart sinking into my stomach as the memories came crashing down.

No no no.

I could already hear the words, the accusation. You filthy slut. Dirty whore. Your own stepbrother you only just met…

How did this happen?

I sat up in the bed, clutching the sheets to my chest, my heart beating my lungs to death and pumping dread and horror into my veins.

This can’t be happening.

Blinking rapidly, I saw my clothes in a heap by the door, my undies strewn on the chair, my shoes lying in one corner of the room.

I desperately tried to remember what happened last night that had led to me in bed with my new stepbrother; Luca Salvatore, the don of the entire Italian mafia and most dangerous man in all of Chicago.

My mother was getting married to his father; Manuel Salvatore, the retired godfather of the city. She had invited me for the little get together Manuel was throwing to celebrate their union. As usual, Amanda; my mother and I had gotten into an argument about what I was wearing and why I wasn’t even trying to fit in with the crowd and I had drank myself silly to drown her incessant tittering.

Worthless.

Piece of shit.

Mistake.

The accusations were piling up on top me, squeezing my heart of everything I had in me. I could hear his voice, feel his lips, his hands and teeth as he repeated those dreaded words over and over again.

The used condoms on the floor sealed the deal for me.

I clutched the sheets as the reality of this situation dawned on me.

I need to get out of here.

Luca was still talking about god knows what on the phone and my common sense kicked in, deciding that now was the perfect time to make my escape if I wanted to leave unscathed.

I stepped out of the bed, almost tripping over myself, thanks to my blurry tearstained vison and managed to put my clothes on.

“Stop right there,” the voice commanded, thick and deep and demanding.

I swallowed, every cell in my body fighting against the sheer common sense to obey. But there’s not a single man alive that will tell me what to do and the most dangerous man in the city isn’t going to change that.

I was going to leave him right there, however the sound of a gun cocked in my direction stopped me in my tracks.

“Turn around.”

I did. Slowly. Begrudgingly but only because there was a gun aimed at my head.

Luca Salvatore was too goodlooking for his own good but the darkness in his eyes ruined it for me.

How on earth did I end up in bed with a man like him.

From past experience, I knew better than to mess with men in the mafia but somehow, the reasons had blurred in my head last night.

He was lying in bed, silk white sheets twisted around him. My face paled at the recent scratches on his body, his heavily mussed hair, the lipstick marks on the corner of his lips, his body.

My cheeks burned as I remembered the feel of his naked skin against mine, his rough hands cupping my body.

“Who the fuck are you?”

I blinked, hurt and annoyance eating at my chest, softening my retort because he was currently armed and dangerous. I have heard a lot of rumours about the don. Most people agreed that he was a little too trigger happy and the last thing I needed right now was my murder on his bloody hands.

“Cara. Cara Torello.” The blank look in his eyes sparked with annoyance at my last name.

That makes two of us.

“Fuckk!” He cussed angrily, shutting his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose as he looked up at the ceiling and blew out a frustrated breath.

He looked at me again, his jaw clenched. Tension and unease coiled tight between us like a tight spring.

“Pack your shit and leave,” he muttered, tossing his gun on the nightstand and folding his large arms as he stared at me with unsettling grey eyes.

I rolled my eyes because that’s exactly what I was trying to do before he chose to acknowledge my existence.

I could still feel his irritated stare burning my back before I shut the door firmly behind me, hoping to put this day and this experience far behind me.

I had no such luck because the first person I ran into as soon as I left the room was a disgruntled Amanda. Her eyes widened at my rumpled and haphazard state and I watched as she squinted at me, registering my messed up hair, rumpled clothes and the direction I was coming from.

“You bitch!” she snarled, grabbing my arm and yanking me into an enclosure in the wall, “I took a big risk getting you involved in this family and I won’t have you ruining everything for me before I have even officially married Manuel.”

A panic attack was clawing its way up my throat but I swallowed it down and schooled my expression because from experience, I knew to always always plead the fifth.

“Let go of me. I did nothing wrong.” Nothing that she knows of anyway.

Her fingers dug into my skin as she pulled me in and sniffed at me, her face pinching into a scowl. “Don’t lie to me. You’re just a whore. Always was, always have been. Of course you’d jump right into the bed of the first man you find.”

It occurred to me that she didn’t know who I had slept with. She probably didn’t believe her own words.

I could see why she was overreacting this way when she used to look the other way when it came to matters concerning me. Managing to score a man Manuel Salvatore after years of barely scraping by was a damn near impossible feat. She had the opportunity to live in the laps of luxury from this marriage with him, of course she wouldn’t want anyone to ruin it.

“Look, mama, I didn’t do anything, I promise. I just got drunk last night and had one of the servants find me a room. I just woke up and I’m incredibly hungover and I’ll appreciate if you can hound me about your false suspicions some other time.”

Her hold on me slackened, her eyes flickering with uncertainty, proving my theory correct.

She didn’t know a damn thing and was just suspecting the worst about me.

“I’m not you mamà,” she spat acidly as her last jab before she walked away.

My shoulders slumped and I exhaled another breath I didn’t even know I had been holding and I found my way out of the dreaded mansion.

# Chapter 2

Cara’s pov

“She’s so beautiful,” cried a woman to my left and I rolled my eyes just as another woman scoffed.

“She’s nothing but a shameless, penniless gold digger. Look how tacky her shoes are.”

“I heard that Manuel didn’t contribute a single dime to her wedding dress. It was the final test of her loyalty.”

The second woman snorted, “that explains that ill fitting dress.”

“Shh! You have to be quiet. Luca is glaring at us.”

The mention of my stepbrother’s name had me whirling around in the direction the women were trying desperately hard to avoid.

He was glaring alright, but not at the old gossiping women. Luca Salvatore was glaring at me. Molten grey eyes were searing holes into the side of my head as one of his men relayed a piece of information too urgent to wait till the end of the wedding ceremony.

I frowned, a tiny frown so that he couldn’t accuse me of blatantly disrespecting him and perforate my skull with well aimed bullets.

What does he want now?

If I were him, I’d happily forget my existence and not make it known to the whole church that something had happened between us.

I was used to people staring at me, sometimes in admiration, most times in horror, but that’s not the point. The point is I knew how to live with getting stared at even if they were being unbearingly obvious about it. I knew how to ignore it and continue on my merry way but it was taking a herculean effort fending off Luca’s glare.

Thankfully, the ceremony ended without any altercation and I found myself on the lawn of the prestigious Salvatore estate, sipping orange juice and trying to pretend like I was enjoying the reception even though I was sick to my stomach and couldn’t wait to go home.

But Amanda had warned me against leaving before I had officially introduced myself to the family and I knew better than to chase away my misery with alcohol.

Gossip and blatant stares poured out of lips as easily as refreshments and I was becoming more and more miserable with each passing second, second guessing the life choices I made that led up to this point.

The only reason I hadn’t lost my stomach yet and braved through the reception was because Luca was no longer a big dark cloud hovering around me. Knowing who he was and the kind of job he does, he was probably off somewhere hacking some poor man to death.

The reality of the kind of family I was now a part of made me scowl in distaste. Hopefully, after today is done, I wouldn’t be expected to interact anymore with the Salvatores.

I couldn’t look at the wealth dripping off this place without thinking of red, splotchy blood and the loud bangs of gunshots. I’m very sure that if I peeled off the paint on the walls, the blood of their enemies and victims would spill out in its place.

I closed my eyes against the hacking of my heartbeat and sipped more juice.

Really, I couldn’t wait for the day to be over. I was already looking forward to heading back to my dingy apartment, climbing into bed in nothing but my underwear and a large tshirt and spending the rest of the holiday binging on The Devil Wears Prada, even though I’ve rewatched it a million times over.

“Caraaa!” Amanda’s shrill call startled me out of my imagination where everything was warm and cozy. “Come here, baby, come and say hi to the family.”

I swallowed and plastered on a fake as f u ck smile before turning around to meet my new family.

Manuel was standing tall and proud and imposing, his arm around Amanda’s slim waist. He intimidated me, that man. He had very thick eyebrows and dark dark eyes weathered by old age and a thick beard and moustache that made it look like he was constantly glowering at someone.

Despite my good intentions and the blank stare Manuel was currently throwing my way, I couldn’t stop my hands from trembling as darkness covered my vision and all I could hear was the bang of a gun going off and red staining my shoes.

“This is my daughter, Cara,” Amanda’s voice broke through the murky waters as I clenched a hand into fist trying to stop myself from fidgeting like a terrified school girl about to be chastised by her worst teacher.

“It’s nice to meet you,” I remembered to say, before the awkward silence could bloom into something thicker and heavier.

“This is your daughter?” He asked in a thick and heavily accented voice. “She looks nothing like you, stellina.”

Amanda laughed dryly and patted Manuel softly on the chest. “That’s because Cara was adopted when Theo was desperate for a girl child.”

“Theo. That is your ex-husband.”

“Yes. We lost him to a car accident, remember?”

Manuel nodded and kissed Amanda on the forehead. “Of course, I remember, tesoro.”

To me, he said, “You are welcome to the family, Cara. I trust that you won’t be giving us any problems as you are now part of the family and we Salvatores must uphold a certain image.”

I gave him a tight smile, wondering what Amanda must have told him about me. “I won’t, sir-”

“Call me Manuel,” he cut me short, “we are now family and there is no need for formality with me.”

I smiled and nodded, turning my attention to Gina, Manuel’s daughter who was typing away on her phone, in a world of her own.

Manuel and Amanda had already left us to entertain the other girls.

“Hi,” I prodded, giving her my best ‘I got you girl!’ smile, “it’s nice to meet you. I’m Cara.”

She lifted her eyes up from her phone and regarded me like I was stale, bloody meat. Her eyes immediately went cold as she flashed me a sickly sweet smile. “The pleasure is all mine, Cara. Your dress is… interesting.”

I looked down at the gold sequin dress I was currently wearing. It was two sizes too small but it was really cute and had been on sale and I had paired it with my favourite boots. “What’s wrong with it?”

“Oh nothing,” she shrugged, “if your intention is to look like a slut, that is.” And she promptly turned back to her phone and walked away.

My left eyes twitched. Old Cara wanted to chase after her and have the last laugh. New Cara knew that there would be hell to pay if our interaction escalated into a full blown fight. I had already fucked up once by ending up in bed with my new stepbrother, I just had to get through today without any altercation.

Suddenly, shouts and screams erupted from one corner of the courtyard and, unable to stop myself, I looked and saw that Luca of all people was holding a poor innocent man at gunpoint.

Silence fell throughout the entire garden until it was quiet enough for the entire guests to hear him say in a deadly whisper. “Repeat what you said about her.”

“D- Don, I don’t- Please. I can’t-”

“Don’t waste my time, Rico.”

One second. Two seconds. Rico was wasting his time.

BANG.

The explosion of the gun made me shake, slushing orange juice over my hand.

More than one person screamed as Rico’s blood and brain matter splattered on the ground.

See? What did I tell you? My new stepbrother was a trigger happy mad man.

I was only fooling myself believing that I could get through today without inebriating myself.

Sighing, I drained the rest of my orange juice and went to look for some alcohol.

# Chapter 3

Cara’s pov

As soon as I opened the door to the guest bathroom to relieve myself of all the orange juice and red wine that had come back with a vengeance, I promptly regretted it and wanted to turn back around and find a different bathroom with the help of the cute server from earlier.

But shutting the door and running away would as well announce my defeat because right there, washing the blood of his hand was none other than Luca Salvatore.

Dark grey eyes flicked over to me in annoyance as I braved the daunting task of stepping into the bathroom and shutting the door behind me, practically shutting myself in with a literal wild animal.

He let out an irritated grunt deep in his throat and said nothing else, going back to washing his hand. He had taken off his rings and wristwatch and had rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, exposing taut, bulging muscle rippling under golden tan skin.

I hated how attraction for him burned hot and bright and furious in my lower abdomen but I fought to remind myself that I didn’t want a repeat of last time. My bladder felt like it was about to burst open and Luca was taking his sweet time washing his hands, thick red blood swirling around the drainage of the sink.

My throat tightened. Who had he killed this time?

I knew it was probably stupid of me to be alone with a hardened criminal and seasoned killer but my pride and ego far outweighed my common sense.

Dropping my glass of sweet, sweet wine on the granite top sink, I chose the farthest stall away from him and took my sweet time relieving myself but when I came back out, he was still there, drying his hands and putting on his wristwatch.

My face twisted into a scowl but I ignored him and walked to the sink to wash my hands.

I could feel his eyes on the side of my face. It made the air around me thick, heavy and uncomfortable.

“”Did you have to kill him?” I had to ask when the silence became stilffing.

A dark lazy gaze bored into me, “did you know what he said about you?”

I froze. What?

Schooling my expression into chilling nonchalance, I shrugged. “Don’t care.”

“Well I care,” he said, in that deep voice that made my insides jump through hoops. “Apparently, you go to the same school, that you’re easy and you have the sweetest pussy on campus.”

My hands were trembling as I held them together. I racked my brain for a recollection of the terrified young man but I came up short. Did we really go to the same school? Did he really know about me? S h i t!

“You see how that can be a problem, don’t you?”

I shrugged again, feigning nonchalance. “I don’t see anything, Luca. And why do you care, even? Just leave me alon-”

The word stuck in my throat because Luca was standing behind me, ice and animosity radiating off of him, sinking into my bones and making my teeth chatter. “That’s going to be difficult, micetta, seeing as you’re now part of the family and you have an image to uphold. I can’t have our allies and enemies thinking we can’t control our women.”

My stomach dropped as fury and annoyance took its place. “Hey, what do you mean control? And I’m not a part of you guys, okay? Let’s get that straight. I’m only here because of my mother and after today, I have zero intentions of playing house with your family.”

“You’re not the one to make that call.”

My heart sank. “W- what do you mean?”

“I mean you can’t keep whoring around and you need to pull yourself into the semblance of a respectable woman. You’ll be fending off potential suitors if you don’t.”

“And what if I don’t want potential suitors?” My voice was small, tight, because he was stepping closer and closer into my space. He was so close to me that I could feel his chest graze my back when I tried to stand straighter, I could almost taste his scent on my tongue.

“Well that’s too bad, mia cara.”

I swallowed, why did he say it like that? Why did he sound like that?

“I’m serious. I can’t-”

“You can’t keep wearing these kind of dresses that make you look like an easy lay. Although that defeats the purpose of who you really are.”

“And who am I?”

I felt a tight tug on my ponytail. He was wrapping my hair around his fist and something was turning my insides inside out.

Easing out of his hold, I maintained a neutral expression as I turned around to face him.

Jesus, he was even more goodlooking up close, my heart skipped several beats just standing so close to him when his dark grey eyes locked in mine.

I swallowed and reached for his jacket, gently slipping his button through the hole. “Is that what you think I am?”

“No.”

“No?” My hands froze against his chest as I looked up at him.

“I think you’re far worse.” His accent was thicker, heavier, his voice deeper.

Hn, I scoffed. My hands stroked down his chest and rested against his abdomen, a few inches above his belt.

“And does that turn you on?”

“You rate yourself a little too high, micetta.”

“Hm, so do you care to explain this?” My hand slipped between us, where his hardened erection was pushing against my stomach and I rested my hand against the bulge.

He let out a short curse, nearly stumbling over, his breath coming up in short rasps. “Cara.”

He pushed deeper into my hand as I rubbed him up and down, peering up into his eyes and smirking at the pained and sexually frustrated expression on his handsome face.

He wasn’t stopping me or I would have come back to my senses a long time ago.

There was a hot feeling in my chest, knowing that I was damning us both straight to hell with my actions, but I couldn’t find it in me to care about the consequences when I was pretty much bringing this powerful man to his knees with just a handjob.

“F u ck, Cara.” He cursed, his hand grabbing the sink and caging me in. He was all I could see now. His delicious scent was all around me.“Don’t stop. I’m going to come.”

Something about his voice, the firm and aggressive tone, the order that demanded to be obeyed made me want to do exactly that. Something told me that this man was used to getting what he wanted. He only had to say what he wanted in that tone and it was as good as his.

So naturally, I fought to disobey him.

Squeezing softly and feeling something in me explode with need at the rough, gravely moan he rasped out, I leaned up on my toes and kissed his cheek as eagerly as I’d kiss his mouth. And when I was done, I brought my lips close to his ears. “You see, Luca, the problem is; I like sex a lot more than I fear you and there’s not a single man alive that will tell me what to do with my life and with my body. Looks like I’ll be remaining a slut for a long time to come.”

I dragged his earlobe between my teeth, tugging gently and patted him softly.

He gritted his teeth in annoyance when I stepped away from him and snatched up my wineglass from the sink and before I made my escape, I turned around and flashed a smile at him, although the smile turned into a wide eyed grin when I saw the lipstick marks on his cheek and collarbone, his coat and dress shirt askew, his even harder and more visible bulge and frustrated and enraged look in his eyes.

I tipped the glass in a cheers motion, turned around and left the bathroom.

# Chapter 4

Luca’s pov

I have never put myself in a position I couldn’t get myself out of since I was fourteen, and never in my life has that been because of a woman.

But here I was, sitting in my car, palming a raging hard on that refused to go down no matter how many times I jerked off to dirty thoughts of her, her voice, her s e xy little body, nimble little hands and pouty little mouth.

It didn’t help that I haven’t been able to even look at other women since I met her. The thought of touching someone else to rid me of this aching lust made me tick with repulsion.

Fuck, she wasn’t even my type.

I liked my women pliant, submissive, dark haired, eager to please but meek about it. Cara was the exact opposite. She talked too much, laughed too hard, she was the only blonde I have ever met in the entire cosa nostra and everything pointed to the fact that she was selfish in bed; taking what she wanted and not giving a flying f uck about her partner.

To be honest, I don’t know how I could ever have approached her first. I had met her only once, in a brief introduction I didn’t care about. She was frowning throughout the occasion and when she wasn’t frowning, she tacked on a smile that was as fake and cheap as those imitated red soled louboutins I had seen her wear on two different occasions.

She liked to act like she wasn’t excited that her mamma was getting married to my papa. I knew that one year as a Salvatore would do more to alleviate her impoverished life than all the years she has lived as a Torello.

She probably saw an opportunity to get even more from the family, that was why she sneaked into my room that night.

I cursed as memories of that night washed over me, making me even harder than I already was.

And as if my thoughts and desperations had conjured her up, I saw her leave the bodega she had spent the last fifteen minutes in. She was calling out goodbye to the barista that sold her coffee, the barista that was only nice to her and served her oat milk for the price of regular milk every f u c k i n g day of the week because he wanted to f u c k her.

If he hadn’t already, a nagging voice told me.

The fact that she may have actually f u cked him before made my hands curl around the steering wheel.

Better teach him a lesson before he gets any ideas about having seconds.

She was smiling hard, the sun shining down on her glowing skin, her long blonde hair I had made the mistake of pulling that time in the bathroom. Now I know what it felt like, how soft and silky it really was and now, I had half the mind to drag her all the way to my bed and f u c k the memories of he away as hard as I can until I forget her face and the feel of her hands, her smart mouth and bold smile.

She was holding a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine in a brown paper bag in one hand and her favourite coffee in another hand. She was wearing nothing but a thin white tanktop, her full, pert b reasts pushed against the flimsy fabric that barred most of her toned stomach and black cotton shorts that could as well be panties that barely covered her a s s.

I rapt my fingers on the steering wheel, clenching it tight when the urge to follow after her became too difficult to bear.

An irritating itch started behind my neck, darkness curdled my veins as I watched her walk up the stairs towards her apartment.

I wanted to follow her but f uck it, I won’t let her win.

I was going to leave, to drive off now that I had tracked down where she lived and caught a glimpse of her to feed my aching lust, but my resolve exploded into bits when I saw her stop before a guy, a preppy blonde guy smiling brighter than the f u c k i n g sun at her. I wondered if she had f ucked him before too. I was starting to realize that my new stepsister was more work than she was worth.

I shouldn’t care about her, shouldn’t worry who she sleeps with as long as she was being discreet about it.

But when he reached out and touched her hair, a golden brown tendril that curled slightly and fell down the front of her face, I ground my teeth and exited my car, slamming the door shut with much more force than was necessary. The sun burned bright and heavy against my back but it was nothing compared to the molten lava flowing in my veins.

I walked up to her and I saw the man tighten with intimidation when I came up from behind her.

Her slender shoulders tensed and she turned around, a scowl on her face.

“Well if it isn’t my fratello.” Her sharp smile could cut through ice.

I glowered, although dark amusement sparked in my eyes. Italian sounded fascinating on her tongue. Like it was something she hadn’t grown up with.

I walked closer to her and dropped my voice so that only she could hear. “Do brothers know what their sisters taste like?”

She flinched from me, terror and annoyance in her cornflower blue eyes.

“Your brother?” Blondie asked.

“Stepbrother,” she said firmly, those startling eyes, icy cold on me for a few seconds before she turned around. “I’ll see you later, Tony. You better not start that movie without me.”

He nodded and left.

She sighed and deftly held her coffee cup in the hand that was already laden with the paper bag, pushed her key into the keyhole, opened her door and walked in.

She was about to shut the door but I intercepted it and pushed my way in.

She scowled at me before going to drop her groceries on the counter top of her open concept kitchen. “Well, what can I do for you, Salvatore?”

“This thing with Tony, end it. It goes without saying that you can’t be alone with a man under no conditions, since it’s obvious that you can’t be trusted with one.”

She leaned against the wall with her left shoulder, “and what do you say for yourself?”

I leaned closer until the tips of her breasts grazed my chest. “But I thought I was your fratello.”

She sniffed and looked up at me, blue eyes bluer than ice. “What the f u c k do you want, Salvatore.”

I grabbed her hand and placed it on my aching c0ck, hissing when she curled her hand around it. “I want you to finish what you started.”

She was a f ucking tease, because just like last time, she fitted her body into mine and gazed up at me with those f u c k me eyes and just like last time, my common sense took a hike on me, so that I was only thinking with my d!ck.

Her blue tipped nails raked down my torso as she leaned up to whisper in my ear. “And what exactly do you want, Luca? Want me to get down on my knees for you? To suck you off? Or how about I bend over for you right now? Would you like that.”

She stroked me softly, cupping my e r e c t i o n with her eager hands and I gripped her fiercely, a deep groan escaping my throat. “You’re still so hard for me, it’s pathetic, you know. You’re pathetic,” she whispered venomously. ”F u c k you, Luca.”

She stepped away from me and was about to turn away and leave but I gripped her shoulder and hips and bent her over the counter, her ass up, her head forced down.

Grabbing her ponytail, I yanked her head up and pressed my hardened e r e c t i o n hard against her ass. “Want to repeat that again, sweetheart?” I growled icily against her ears, rocking my hips roughly into hers, unable to get my release fast enough.

She struggled beneath me, yelling at me, “what the f u c k is wrong with you? Get off of me!”

“I don’t think so,” I rasped, taking her tiny cotton shorts in my hands, I ripped it off, tearing it off of her easily, groaning when I saw her beautiful pert a s s on display for me.

MY hand splayed flat on her a s s and slid up her slender hips. “How about I teach you a lesson on finishing what you started.”

“Luca,” she warned.

“Fratello,” I growled.

“What-”

“If you want me to stop, call me fratello.”

“What are you doing? Don’t you dare- ah!” she groaned loudly when I thrust two fingers into her dripping w e t pussy.

F u c k, she was even wetter than I imagined.",1,1746440734.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I am not at all regular at Starbucks. And up till now have only prefered their cold milk coffee like the frappes, mochas , java chip coffe tletc.
