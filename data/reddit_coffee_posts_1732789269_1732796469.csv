1h1uq80,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h1uq80/aliexpress_baskets_nice_surprise/,Aliexpress baskets - nice surprise,"After a long and overwhelming [research](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1go2qep/novice_overwhelmed_by_options_grinder_machine/), I decided to jump into the espresso rabbit hole by buying Kingrinder K6 and Dedica 685 (knowing many flaws of the machine, but considering it will be appropriate first step).

I just got a package from AliExpress where I got a simple WDT tool, a funnel, MHW-3Bomber coffee scale and a mesh puck-screen, as well as a bottomless portafilter and two baskets.

To play around until the portafilter and new baskets come, I have initially drilled a hole in the second bottom of my originally pressurized portafilter to de-pressurize it, but still could never pull a good shot with it. Now I pulled a few shots with new baskets from Ali and, after a bit of dialing in, got a much more balanced, much more satisfying shot than ever before.

I will probably get a normcore/IMS basket down the road, but for now, I think ""CafeGaGa"" baskets and portafilter will do just fine. I have looked the baskets under the magnifying glass and found no metal shavings and the holes actually look pretty consistent for such a no-name cheap basket.

Is this just ""lottery"" or are there actually useful items on Ali (not regarding scales, WDT and similar tools)?

if u cant consult a doctor a better option would be just spend some time in the sun whatever time u want to wake up like if u want to wake up at 5(no sun at that time agreeD) then be outside or rooftop or in the balcony for 15-20 minutes after sun rise do this at any cost even if u sleep afterwards in the day 
and in the evening spend some time in the dark (not dark dark ) like in the dawn time when is the sun is going down or already gone spend 20-30 minutes at that time too 
then at the time u sleep move your phone to other room 1hour or 45 minutes before u going to sleep i know its hard but u have to do it if u dont want to stay awake until 4-5 am doing nothing just scrolling. also if u can have dim lights 30-45 minutes before bedtime.

take a notebook or get a print of a excel table and mark daily write down your wake up and sleep time in the morning along with the markings to daily sunrise and sunset time (this will help u on the days u dont feel very good or the day u fail to do it)

most of the time we say its hard to sleep - its hard because we are continiosly feeding our brains keeping it stimulated if u cant sleep without phone here is a fun exercise u can use to sleep quickly 


Exercise- think of any letter then think about diffrent word starting from that letter fruits objects names anything at all then think about a memory ou anything u can remeber related to that word keep doing it for some time and u wont even know ur brain will get kind of overloaded and sleep for example - letter M- mango - (either describe it or try remebering any fun memory related to it )my brother and i used to eat kilos of mango evryday until i hit my teenage -TRY this exercise with a diffrent letter every day.



the moment u wake up wash your face then do something fun and uses brain something like wordle or any other puzzles like suduko then start studying-its like a kick start for the brain  (dont u dare check messages in the morning)  


for the caffine addicts out there - dont take coffee 9 hours before your sleep time or u wont be able to sleep well
try not to sleep in the day time coz then it will affect your sleep time at night 


do this for 15-20 days it will change ur sleep schedule
 i made this routine most of it from the sleep related podcats of dr hubermann and some other videos along with my own changes	


my experience- u might be thinking its too much or waste of time but i did this for just 10 days and now its a habbit now only if my times shifts i reinforce the sunset and sunrise regime thats the  actuall way of aligning ur circadinan rythm and it produces natural melatonin in ur body(hormone responsible for your body clock) and i started this in august and i used to wake up at 4am and sleep between 9-10 pm now i have shifted it because the time of waking and sunrise should not have a diffrence of more than 1:30 hours because then ull end up sleeping on the table(personally experimented and tested ) so as sun rises around 6:30 i wake up around 5 am



its not that hard uf u really want to do it and beleive me when i say this its much much better then waking up whole night- instagram has brainwashed people into thinking that they are night owls just so people use their app even more (thats how i think of it) most of you guys thought u were night owls started staying up late and now u feel wasted even after waking up from a 8 hour sleep.


this was all i had to say this was all my work in the past few months 

200%it will work if u follow this 2 of my friends have already fixed their sleep cycles others didnt took this seriously and still suffering dont make their mistake and ALL THE VERY BEST ",3,1732796257.0,JEENEETards,1,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

She had pink hair, pink eyeshadow and pink checked trousers, and this super intense gaze and she was with two friends. 

We kept making eye contact and my best friend kept telling me to go and talk to her. At one point I got up to put my coffee cup away and she turned her head to look at me when I walked past. I was super nervous to approach her because I always feel like I'm bothering people (especially other women) so I waited until I was ready to leave, and then went up to her and said that I was sorry to interrupt, but that I absolutely loved her style and outfit and thought it was super pretty. She smiled and said thank you and I left. 

Probably never going to see her again but I'm happy I got the courage to approach for once and it was pretty well received!

The good:

• Price: the gyms here are way cheaper than back home and the price to quality ratio is seriously impressive.

• Equipment: the gyms have pretty much everything you'd need and the equipment is high quality, and gets fixed / replaced pretty quickly. Could do with a few more of each machine though, as seems to be one of each is the par. Also, most gyms seem to have a pool which is nice.

• People: the people in the gym are for the most part really kind and friendly. I'm a bigger guy so I've always been self conscious in the gym but everyone here seems to really big each other up. There still a few ego lifters and juice heads but that's the case everywhere.

The bad:

• Hygiene: Almost nobody carries sweat towels and I've never seen anyone wipe down a machine before / after use. There's no spray or hand sanitizer anywhere and, at least from my experience in the locker room, the majority of guys are not washing their hands.

• Respect: People treat the equipment like trash. Slamming weights, not re-racking and just generally leaving shit everywhere. The first gym I was in also had a big issue of people smoking in the changing room but I've never encountered that at my current gym so that's likely an outlier.

• Hogging: People use benches as tables for their phones, coffee, hoodies and just to sit and watch TikTok for ages. It's not uncommon to see someone using three benches at once.

• PT's: the PT's seem friendly enough but they are really pushy about buying personal training and more than once I've seen them straight up kick someone off a piece of equipment because they want it for their client.

The downright bizzare:

• Clothing: It will never not be funny to me seeing guys working out in a shirt and jeans or girls in full face makeup.

• Food: I've regularly seen people bring full on meals into the gym and just have a mid workout snack like McDonald's or a bowl of noodles.

• Stretching: Some of the warm-ups I've seen are bordering on contortionism. I've seen people walking up and down their friend's backs or bending arms almost to the point of dislocation.

Anyway, as I said this is entirely based on my own experience so please don't come for me with the 'you're generalizing!'. I'd like to hear if others have had any funny or interesting stories from gyms here too.",7,1732795614.0,chinalife,9,1.0,False

1h1uepj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1h1uepj/beware_the_malicious_owl/,beware the malicious owl >:},"The Owl Above the Door

It started with the door creaking open in the dead of night. No breeze stirred the room, yet the door swung lazily on its hinges. I’d lock it before bed, and by morning, it would be ajar. At first, I blamed the humidity, the warped wood of an old house. But then I noticed the scratches.

Tiny, deliberate scratches around the doorframe, like something had been climbing.

One evening, as I closed the door and secured the latch, I glanced up. That’s when I saw it—perched above the door like a grotesque gargoyle. An owl. Its eyes gleamed faintly in the dim light, twin coins of molten gold. Its feathers were matted and dark, blending into the shadows of the ceiling. It didn’t move, didn’t blink. It just stared.

“Hoot,” it murmured, but the sound was sharp, mocking.

I laughed nervously and waved it off. “Shoo! Go on!”

It tilted its head, impossibly far, as if pondering my command. Then it leaped, spreading its wings—massive wings that seemed too big for such a small creature. It vanished into the hallway with a rustle of feathers, leaving only a faint draft and the unsettling feeling that it hadn’t really left.

The small inconveniences began the next day. My keys disappeared from the hook by the door, turning up hours later in the freezer. My phone battery drained inexplicably overnight, though I had plugged it in. I’d find drawers half-open, contents slightly rearranged. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. Then I found the feather.

A black, greasy feather lying on my keyboard.

The owl was back that night. I saw it sitting on the bookshelf, talons curling around the edges of my books. It stared at me with those luminous eyes, unblinking. This time, it didn’t hoot. It just watched as I tried to focus on my work. Every time I glanced up, it was still there. Watching.

I tried to get rid of it. I opened windows, left food outside, even bought an ultrasonic bird repellent. The owl didn’t care. It was always there—perched on the top of my monitor, or the edge of the coffee table, or, worst of all, above the door. Its favorite spot.

And then it got bolder.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt a weight on my chest. My eyes shot open, and there it was—sitting on me, its talons lightly pressing into my skin. Its eyes burned with cruel intelligence. “Hoo,” it whispered, and for the first time, I swore it smiled.

“You’re not real,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The owl tilted its head and hopped off me, gliding silently out of the room. But before it disappeared, it knocked over a glass of water on my nightstand with a flick of its wing, spilling it onto my phone.

I began to realize it wasn’t just an owl. It was something more. It wasn’t here to hurt me—not physically. No, its purpose was far worse. It was here to annoy me into madness.

It deleted my saved files seconds before I submitted them. It turned off the coffee maker after I’d left the room. It unplugged my Wi-Fi router at the most inconvenient times. And no matter how many times I changed the passwords on my devices, it somehow got in.

One morning, I opened my laptop to find a new folder on my desktop titled “>:}”. Inside were hundreds of images of the owl, all taken from my webcam.

I smashed the laptop with a hammer.

Desperation turned to fury. “What do you want?” I screamed one night, clutching a broom like a weapon.

The owl, perched as always above the door, stared at me with those glowing eyes. Then, for the first time, it spoke in a voice that wasn’t a hoot.

“You left the window open.”

“What?”

“It’s my house now.”

I don’t sleep anymore. The owl won’t let me. It taps on the walls, scratches at the furniture, whispers nonsense into my ears. I tried to leave, but the car wouldn’t start. The bus station was closed. Every time I step outside, I see it in the distance, perched on a power line or a lamppost, its golden eyes never leaving me.

Now, it’s not just an owl. I see it in the shadows, in the corners of my vision, in the static of my television. It’s everywhere, always watching, always waiting. I don’t know what it wants, but I know I’ll never escape.

Because it’s not just an owl.

It’s malice incarnate.

And it’s never leaving.

**How can collagen benefit your gut?**

* **Gut lining repair:** Collagen can help repair and strengthen the gut lining, reducing leaky gut symptoms like bloating, gas, and food sensitivities.
* **Improved digestion:** Collagen can promote healthy digestion by supporting the production of digestive enzymes.
* **Probiotic growth:** Some studies suggest that collagen can create a favorable environment for the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.

After my morning coffee which gives me so much energy and dopamine, if I make the mistake and start listening to music, all that energy is gone.

Also, when I feel anhedonia (which I believe is a part of taking SSRIs) I find music really really irritating. The anhedonia makes me feel fatigued and when music comes in too,then I just feel even more fatigued

1h1ubxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h1ubxk/beware_the_malicious_owl/,beware the malicious owl >:},"The Owl Above the Door

It started with the door creaking open in the dead of night. No breeze stirred the room, yet the door swung lazily on its hinges. I’d lock it before bed, and by morning, it would be ajar. At first, I blamed the humidity, the warped wood of an old house. But then I noticed the scratches.

Tiny, deliberate scratches around the doorframe, like something had been climbing.

One evening, as I closed the door and secured the latch, I glanced up. That’s when I saw it—perched above the door like a grotesque gargoyle. An owl. Its eyes gleamed faintly in the dim light, twin coins of molten gold. Its feathers were matted and dark, blending into the shadows of the ceiling. It didn’t move, didn’t blink. It just stared.

“Hoot,” it murmured, but the sound was sharp, mocking.

I laughed nervously and waved it off. “Shoo! Go on!”

It tilted its head, impossibly far, as if pondering my command. Then it leaped, spreading its wings—massive wings that seemed too big for such a small creature. It vanished into the hallway with a rustle of feathers, leaving only a faint draft and the unsettling feeling that it hadn’t really left.

The small inconveniences began the next day. My keys disappeared from the hook by the door, turning up hours later in the freezer. My phone battery drained inexplicably overnight, though I had plugged it in. I’d find drawers half-open, contents slightly rearranged. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. Then I found the feather.

A black, greasy feather lying on my keyboard.

The owl was back that night. I saw it sitting on the bookshelf, talons curling around the edges of my books. It stared at me with those luminous eyes, unblinking. This time, it didn’t hoot. It just watched as I tried to focus on my work. Every time I glanced up, it was still there. Watching.

I tried to get rid of it. I opened windows, left food outside, even bought an ultrasonic bird repellent. The owl didn’t care. It was always there—perched on the top of my monitor, or the edge of the coffee table, or, worst of all, above the door. Its favorite spot.

And then it got bolder.

One night, as I lay in bed, I felt a weight on my chest. My eyes shot open, and there it was—sitting on me, its talons lightly pressing into my skin. Its eyes burned with cruel intelligence. “Hoo,” it whispered, and for the first time, I swore it smiled.

“You’re not real,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The owl tilted its head and hopped off me, gliding silently out of the room. But before it disappeared, it knocked over a glass of water on my nightstand with a flick of its wing, spilling it onto my phone.

I began to realize it wasn’t just an owl. It was something more. It wasn’t here to hurt me—not physically. No, its purpose was far worse. It was here to annoy me into madness.

It deleted my saved files seconds before I submitted them. It turned off the coffee maker after I’d left the room. It unplugged my Wi-Fi router at the most inconvenient times. And no matter how many times I changed the passwords on my devices, it somehow got in.

One morning, I opened my laptop to find a new folder on my desktop titled “>:}”. Inside were hundreds of images of the owl, all taken from my webcam.

I smashed the laptop with a hammer.

Desperation turned to fury. “What do you want?” I screamed one night, clutching a broom like a weapon.

The owl, perched as always above the door, stared at me with those glowing eyes. Then, for the first time, it spoke in a voice that wasn’t a hoot.

“You left the window open.”

“What?”

“It’s my house now.”

I don’t sleep anymore. The owl won’t let me. It taps on the walls, scratches at the furniture, whispers nonsense into my ears. I tried to leave, but the car wouldn’t start. The bus station was closed. Every time I step outside, I see it in the distance, perched on a power line or a lamppost, its golden eyes never leaving me.

Now, it’s not just an owl. I see it in the shadows, in the corners of my vision, in the static of my television. It’s everywhere, always watching, always waiting. I don’t know what it wants, but I know I’ll never escape.

Because it’s not just an owl.

It’s malice incarnate.

And it’s never leaving.

~3L water per day split between morning afternoon and evening

Reishi, cordyceps and magnesium malate in the morning, 2 shots of quinton water

Qigong 10 minutes in the morning + 20-30 minute yoga

Gentle exercise (walking/gentle swimming if possible) on a regular basis 

Avoiding coffee, and excessive bread/pasta (reduced intake of simple sugars

Chaga tea

Avoiding stress as much as possible, monitoring heart rate and making sure it stays below the level that causes crashes.

Avoiding crashes like the plague, being super aware of your triggers and pacing up gently, always taking the time to rest if you need it 

Not smoking is also a big one even if the cfs makes you depressed and you can't do anything and it's your comfort mechanism 

If I'm crashing then half a lemon (or full one depending on the crash) in a pint of water helps a lot.

Happy to post qigong + yoga + supplement information (naturitas) for where I get these if people are interested.

Also mentality plays massively into recovery, if I feel like I won't get better I don't, slow and steady seems to work for me and I'm at around 75-80% of my previous health after 2.5 years as long as I avoid all triggers (as much as possible)

Good luck to everyone, it's not a one size fits all but hopefully sharing this info can benefit someone in some way, good luck and lots of love to everyone, you do not lose worth simply because you are less capable than you were! ",1,1732794765.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none
* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

1h1u79c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1h1u79c/coercive_abuse/,Coercive abuse ,"Has anyone had experience with a family member in a coercive relationship, cut off from all family, children, parents etc, financially abused? Just like puppet master on Netflix. 

The man is very slippery, narcissistic and wiggles his way out of legal situations (has done in the past.) so fighting it is a daunting prospect. 

I have spoken with police who said I cannot get any information under ‘Clare’s Law’ as I am not the person in the relationship however they said i would be right in doing so if family member wanted info. (He has history of domestic violence but family member is in denial)

I know he is dangerous, manipulative and emotionally abusive….. I have been victim of his abuse myself.

Family member is isolated and extremely delusional in believing his promises of a luxury life, living on a yacht, owning billion pound companies whilst living in a studio flat & living off food from food banks with hardly any money. 

It is heartbreaking and I’ve had enough. It’s been 10 years. 

Having a relationship with family member is hard because she is so delusional and truly believes this is her whole family’s fault rather than his. I am often criticised for being the problem because I don’t ‘respect’ him. 

He has manipulated and isolated her. She is missing out on her children’s lives and any normality or livelihood. No friends, no job, nothing. 

He owes people thousands of pounds. He’s under investigation, got debt collectors after him and is constantly running away from hotels etc without paying (not cheap ones either). 

I have spoken with therapists and researched everything over and over again. It it just cruel that people like this get away with it and I don’t know what to do. I have avoided doing anything for so long out of fear and every time I confront the situation I am faced with abuse, or threats. 

Whole family has given up on her, but I just wonder if there is any hope of it getting better for her & enjoying life again. 

Sounds awful but I often fantasize about him dying just so she can catch a break & smell the coffee once and for all. 

Any advice welcome. Thank you.

I have also learnt Hibiscus tea triggers a flare up also! Another on my avoid list for now. 

I googled being cold and CPPS and found below:



**Objective:** Chronic abacterial prostatitis/pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is characterized by pain, voiding and sexual dysfunction persisting fo r> 3 months. The symptoms tend to occur in relapses of varying length. To evaluate what causes a relapse and what precautions patients with CP/CPPS undertake to avoid a relapse and/or aggravation of symptoms, individual semi-structured interviews were performed.

**Material and methods:** Information was obtained from semi-structured in-depth interviews with 10 selected men with CP/CPPS (mean age 44 years; 30-62 years). The interviews were transcribed and analysed according to Girorgi's phenomenological method as modified by Malterud.

**Results:** CP/CPPS tended to start in connection with a specific event involving cold exposure, suggesting cold as an initiating stimulus for CP/CPPS. The informants also reported that cold exposure caused aggravation of symptoms and provoked their relapse. Sitting on cold objects, spending time in cold, damp or windy surroundings and walking on a cold floor were provocative and thus were avoided. The exposure did not have to be either prolonged or intense. Heat applied to the perineum, as well as spending time in a warmer climate, gave relief from symptoms.

**Conclusions:** It appears that cold is one of the factors that can trigger a process resulting in CP/CPPS. The fact that cold also causes aggravation of symptoms and can initiate a relapse was evident, as was the fact that symptoms could be relieved by heat. The connection between cold and symptom aggravation is well known among clinicians but has not previously been studied in a systematic way. The fact that cold, in a susceptible man, can initiate a process resulting in CP/CPSS has not been reported before. Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are warranted.

ARIA'S POV

I am speechless for the next few seconds as his words hit me like a freight train. I wait. I wait for his hard eyes to soften with remorse at the harsh words he threw at me but that doesn’t happen. He is glowering at me, nose flaring angrily.

“Adam, how…how could you say that to me?” I say, my eyes crossing over to Sophia who is now hiding her own frame behind his tall, muscular one, “In front of her?”

“Because it’s the truth!” He yells again, startling me into making a small helpless sound. Adam has never yelled at me. And even though it hurts me to admit that he is truly saying the truth, he has never said it to my face and I never really thought he would. I have always known it yet it hurts to hear it come from him. It feels like a thousand needles are pricking my heart and making me bleed out with so much pain.

He runs his fingers through his hair, seeming frustrated. Like he would rather not have this conversation with me. And just when I think it is over, he continues to speak, breaking me even further.

“You were nothing but a mere secretary who wormed her way into my life. If you hadn’t forced yourself on me that night, none of this would have happened! This marriage would have never happened and you know it.”

He brings up the past. Our past. The night that meant everything to me but clearly means nothing to him. I swallow over and over again till my throat and mouth become dry. I can’t cry. No, I can’t appear weak. Not in front of Adam and definitely not in front of Sophia so I keep my tears at bay, urging them to return before they spill down my cheeks.

“I never forced myself on you, Adam. Why won’t you believe me?” I manage to say but he raises a hand to tell me to stop talking and I clamp my lips shut.

“Do not stand there and try to look innocent, Aria because that is far from who you are. I simply said the truth and I do not care if you cannot take it.” He says and stares at me intently.

“Do not let what happened today repeat itself again. Know your place and I will not have any reason to talk to you like this. Do you understand?”

He lays emphasis on every word of warning he is giving me and turns his back against me before I can even open my mouth to speak again.

“Are you okay?” I can’t believe how his voice goes from hard to soft in the next second as he fusses over Sophia. Sophia makes a face that has me balling my fingers into a fist. A face that clearly says she is not okay.

“The coffee was hot and I think I might have to visit the hospital to prevent the burn from leaving a scar.” She says in a quiet voice. I look down at my own body that is also drenched in the same coffee. The coffee wasn’t hot enough to cause a burn but Adam believes her instantly. He pulls her into a hug and embarrassment washes over me like a bucket of ice.

“I’ll drive. Wait here, I will get my keys.” he says as he pulls away, rushing to his office table to grab his car keys before coming back to her side. He takes her purse from her and leads her out. They both seem so lost in each other that they forget my existence totally, leaving me to stand alone in the middle of the room.

Silence falls over me and I am left with my thoughts, licking the wound that his words caused. I have never been able to convince Adam that I didn’t force myself on him yet till this very day, he still believes I drugged him into sleeping with him on the night we were having dinner with his family three years ago. I can never forget the pure look of disgust and shock on his face when we both woke up in each other’s arms the next morning.

I knew since then that Adam would never love me, yet I was hopeful. As the years go by, the hope keeps dwindling with his grandfather, being the only support system in everything.
Sighing, I return to my office and pick up my phone. My eyes widens when I see that a number has called my phone repeatedly all the time I was in Adam’s office. The dread that fills me stems from the fact that I recognise the number as the hospital’s number.

I call back instantly, my heart racing. They pick up on the second ring.

“Mrs Miller, we have been trying to reach you all afternoon!” A female voice says.
“Why? Is something wrong? Is my grandmother okay?” I ask, rushing my words as I am filled with dread and panic.

“You need to be at the hospital, your grandmother—”

I don’t wait to hear the rest of her words. I race out of the room and call on a taxi to drive me to the hospital. I go straight to her hospital room but the sheets and blankets are already being neatly arranged and the bed is empty. More panic. More dread.

“Where is my grandmother?” I ask, “Where is she?”

The nurse cleaning the room gives me a look of pity that nauseates me.

“I am sorry, Mrs Miller but your grandmother died ten minutes ago and has been moved to the hospital’s mortuary. I am sorry.” She says.
The world around me stops and I don’t know how I am able to walk on my two feet to the mortuary where the Nurse leads me. She stops at the door and points to my grandmother laying on a table in the room, her body covered in a white sheet from head to toe.

I walk to the bedside with shaky legs and the moment I take the sheet off and set my eyes on her pale face, I burst out into a loud sob, wishing I could go back to a month ago so I can prevent that accident that made her this way. The accident that took my only living family away from me.

“Grandma…” I call in a broken voice as I reach for her hand. They are too cold, so lifeless and the tears begin to leave my eyes in torrents as I remember how warm these hands used to be when they held my face.

“I’m sorry…I’m so sorry.” I cry, holding tightly unto her and hating myself for not being there in her last moments. I should have been there with her but I was too busy worrying about my place in my husband’s life.
The nurse comes into the room and says, “She asked us to give you this.”

I wipe my tears, sniffling as I take what seems to be a key chain from her. I couldn’t think of a reason why grandmother’s parting gift to me would be a key chain but I can’t seem to care. Her cold hands slammed me into the reality of what had happened. Grandmother is dead. I fall to my knees by the bed and weep, muttering and calling for her to return to me.

“Aria.” Adam’s voice calls from behind me. I am both surprised and relieved to find him there. He must have been contacted by the hospital as well and stopped by since he already came here with Sophia anyway. Sophia is standing in the room with us but I ignore her. I focus on Adam because I need him. I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be fine.

“Adam.” I cry as I walk over to him and hug him without a second thought, my tears gathering and falling again. His body stiffens at my touch but I don’t let go. I need his warmth. I need him because he is really all that I have left and I can’t bear to lose him too. I expect him to push me away but he doesn’t. He doesn’t hug me back too but I can’t find it in me to care as I sob uncontrollably. My tears subside and I sniffle repeatedly and slowly let go of him.

He clears his throat and takes out his phone, saying; “I’ll place a call to start making preparations for her funeral.” He turns around to leave with Sophia also following him but I can’t bear the sight of him turning his back to me and leaving. I grab his hand.

“Stay.” I sound so weak and helpless but I do not give a damn, “Please, don’t go. Stay with me.” I beg.

Adam opens his mouth to say something but a sharp cry stuns us both. We spin around at the same time to the source of the cry and she is crouching, holding her stomach with an expression of pain. Adam rushes to Sophia’s side in a heartbeat and my heart sinks further down my stomach.

“Sophia, are you okay?” He asks with concern ringing high in his voice.

She shakes her head, “There is something I’ve been wanting to tell you but didn’t know how.” She says, holding her stomach as she looks directly at me.

“What is it?” Adam asks, still very much concerned.

“Adam…I…I am pregnant.”

ARIA'S POV

My husband and boss Adam, is laughing at every joke that leaves the lips of his first love while I watch them through the glass doors that separates his office from mine. I had been dutifully preparing some documents that needed his signature and also setting up his meetings for the day like I have done for 7 years as his secretary but since Sophia’s arrival, I have been unable to get any work done.

I feel a pang in my chest every time Adam laughs, almost tearing up at the thought that he has never laughed like that around me. I stare at her slender frame, her lush black hair that bounces back into place even when she throws her head back in laughter and the grace in every of her movements. Sophia is an epitome of feminine grace and every of her features is proof of why Adam has been hung up over her even though they separated years ago. Even though he married me.

The dark binds of his office are brought down abruptly, blocking my view of them both and now all I can see is black. It is as if Adam is trying to prevent me from prying even though I am his wife and privacy shouldn’t be a thing between us, especially when it comes to a woman he used to love so much.

I still remember how shocked I was when she walked up to me earlier, heels clicking ever so sophisticatedly on the office tiles. I saw the feet cladded in shiny red heels before I raised my head to look at her.

“Aria, I didn’t know you still worked here! I can’t believe Adam is still making you work even after you both got married. That man is something, isn’t he?”

She said, smiling sweetly with blood red lips that would look horrifying on me if I dared to try that shade of lipstick. I couldn’t speak, caught in the shock of staring face to face with her after all these years, especially as she still had the same aura of wealth and confidence that I have always known her to possess. For a split second, she made me feel insecure in my gray office wear and my tight bun hair and the fact that I wore little to no makeup.

“Sophia!”

Adam’s voice was what broke me out of that trance I was stuck in as he stepped out of his office and there, right in front of me, he hugged her ever so tightly like an old time friend before he led her back into his office without sparing me as little as a glance.

Now, they are alone together in his office, the blinds of his office pulled shut so that I can’t see them but can only hear their muffled voices and his own laughter every now and then. I squirm in my seat uncomfortably each time they laugh, gripping the edges of my table tightly and too destabilized to get any work done while they are both holed up in there.

I stare at the calendar on my table. Today’s date is marked with a red marker and I sigh deeply. Does he even know today is our third wedding anniversary? Every year, it seems like I am the only one who remembers it and now with Sophia’s appearance, I can already tell that today will pass by like it’s just another day.

I knew she was coming today. Being his secretary is the only reason why I knew the things Adam would rather keep from me. He already briefed me about a new business partner that just returned to the country two months ago and will be at the office at any time. What I didn’t know or should I say, what he purposely kept from me was that the so-called business partner was Sophia Bradley and perhaps the reason why he has been more cold and indifferent than usual, ever since her return.

My heart aches at the realization but it aches even more because there is nothing I can do about it. I have never had a place in Adam’s heart but he has been the only one in mine. I loved him from the very moment he saved my life years ago but I can say the same for him.
He always reminds me even without speaking, that our marriage is nothing but an attempt at fulfilling his grandfather’s wishes and I knew if he had gotten his way, he would have never looked at me twice, not to talk of getting married to me.

Grandfather’s love for me is perhaps the only reason I am still sane in this loveless marriage. The old man never ceases to show how much he cherishes me but when has that ever been enough? I am married to Adam and not his family.

The clock ticks endlessly, yet Adam remains in there with her.

Their laughter dies down all of a sudden and I can barely hear a word they are saying. Unable to hold back anymore, I stand before the restlessness kills me. I am his wife and I deserve to know what is going on. To look natural, I quickly make two cups of coffee. After all, I am his secretary and this is a part of my job.

Nervous sweat breaks out on my forehead as I make my way to his office with unsure steps. Inhaling sharply, I open the door and step in. My heart clenches at the sight of them both, relaxed in each other’s company as they sit so close to each other on one of the couches in his office. I swallow hard and try to walk over to the table with the best confidence I could muster.

“I made coffee.” I say but they don’t even acknowledge my presence, lost in each other and whatever they were discussing. I study Sophia for a moment, watching as she twirls her cherry blonde hair with a finger while seated with one leg crossed over the other to reveal a provocative amount of thighs, smiling so brightly that I can’t tell if she’s faking it.

I want to turn around and leave but my feet fail to move. I can’t just leave like this. For how long will I keep quiet and suck it up?
“Sir,” I call, looking directly at Adam. We are married but he never fails to remind me that I address him as my boss at work. Adam doesn’t even make a move to look at me and anger rises inside of me, slowly boiling.
“Sir,” I call again and that is when he finally regards me with a cold look that almost deters me but I remain firm under his gaze.

“There is something I need to talk to you about, it’s important.” I lie right through my teeth. I can feel Sophia’s gaze burning through me but I try not to look at her, for the fear that my confidence would slip away if I do.

Adam just waves me off.

“It can wait. As you can see, I have a guest.”
“It can’t wait.” I say, even more firmly but he is already back to smiling and listening to Sophia speak like a lovesick teenage boy. I call him a few more times and unable to hold back any longer, I call him by his name instead.

“Adam!”

They both look up at me with a mix of expressions. That of Adam is pure anger while Sophia is obviously irritated. I know she has never liked me and back when I was just his secretary and she was his girlfriend, she complained about every single thing I did.
“Adam, what is this? Is this how you let your employees disrespect you?” She says it with absolute disgust and disrespect.

I am stunned at her words, so stunned that I scoff. Employee? She dares to talk down on me like that even when she knows fully well that I am not just an employee.

Adam stands, his tall frame causing his shadow to sweep over me while I grip the tray of coffee tightly in my hands.

“Aria, out. Now.” He commands and I am filled with so much hurt that my hands shake and my lips quiver.

“Why should I? I have every reason to be in this room and I have every right to speak for you to listen to me.”

Sophia stands at once.

“It seems as though your wife has a bone to pick with me and I will not sit here and take such insults.”

She begins to walk away and of course, Adam follows her. I try to move out of her way but my attempt fails when her shoulder heavily bumps into mine in a way that is too fierce to be considered unintentional. I lose grip of the tray and stagger forward and just like that, the hot coffee spills all over her very expensive looking dress and mine. She shrieks, backing away from me only to glare at me the next second.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” She yells. Adam rushes to her side in less than a minute, fussing over her stained dress and even offering her his handkerchief while I stand there, drenched in coffee as my husband takes care of another woman. I feel the tears prickling at the corner of my eyes but what does crying in front of this woman make me?
“I can’t believe you! What did I ever do to you? Go ahead and dislike me all you want but there is a limit to how far you can go and you just crossed that.” She says again, seething in uncontained anger.

Adam turns to me, eyes dark with rage. It makes me shiver. Makes me feel unimaginable pain to know he is mad at me because of another woman.

“Apologise right now!” He commands and I scoff. How can he stand there and take her side when I did nothing wrong?

“Why should I do that? I have done nothing wrong. She bumped into me!” I defend myself, my voice breaking. Lips quivering.

“I did no such thing!” Sophia says defensively but her eyes tell a different story.
“You heard me, Aria. Apologize to her right now.” Adam says again, still intently looking at me. I almost laugh at the fact that the only time he is looking me directly in the eyes after three years of marriage is when another woman is involved.

I shake my head, finding all of this hard to believe.

“So you believe her over me? You take her words for it but mine does not matter? I am your wife.”

“A wife I never wanted to marry!” He yells back and shatters what is left of my broken heart.

You’re not my person. This place just makes everyone refer to a lost love or friendship or whatever, whoever they’re writing to as “my person”. But you, no you’re not my person. 

My person is the moon child, the yin to my yang. Cristina to my Meredith. The one who plaited my hair into warrior braids after every defeat or victory. The one who fed me, who bathed me, who guarded me whilst I slept after the assault. The one who held my hand all day long on the 24/10 whilst we waited for news of the hearing outcome. The one who cried tears of relief with me. The one who would drag a body across a floor for me no questions asked. 

My person is the Kate to my Tully. The one who drove 300 round mile trip to bring me, little one and the cats home when I was mentally disappearing. The one who helps bathe the little one when I’m so burnt out I can’t manage. The one who takes him off my hands so I can rest. The one who surprises me with random care packages. The one who has been there for 16 years, from teenage years through to adulthood. Gifting each other the parental rights over each others children should the worst ever occur. 

My person is the ones who ring me up telling me they’ve organised childcare cover with my mother and they’re arriving in two hours to take me to the lakes so I can climb my mountain and reset my brain and my nervous system in a way that only that mountain can do. 

My person are the ones who watched my back on the circuit, who tried to feed me when I didn’t have time, who kept the coffee coming, who jumped into action and were ready for any order I had to throw at them so we could make those events happen even in the worst conditions. 

My person is the one who surprised me with concert tickets to my favourite old 90s artists, took me on surprise trips to my favourite countryside towns, my favourite bookshops and bought me a bambi necklace to honour an old nickname I’d long since forgotten my own connection to. 

My person is all those people and more. You’re not my person in that sense, no. This place just tells me I must refer to you as such. You are however the one I love more than even all those people above, and the one who would always have had a place amongst them. The one I feel is missing when I’m with all those people and we’re creating these incredible life long memories and pulling off the impossible. 

They were the ones who picked me up off the ground, sometimes even literally. They’re the ones who presented me a crown of sunflowers and reminded me at my worst times, the strength and fortitude I had to pull through all of it, they’re the ones who held my hand as I cried, the ones who tended to the bruises and cuts, they’re the ones who ensured there was a strict barrier in place so that the controlling one couldn't get backstage to harass or cause more damage. 

They are my people, my village, my tribe. They gave me, perhaps now when i reflect on it, probably the most appropriate and beautiful nickname, they could give me. When i think now of the similarities between myself and who they nicknamed me after, I can see it, and i see their infinite love and care for my wellbeing. It makes me wonder what nickname you would give me these days. What caring, loving or even hurtful thing would I be compared to? 

Some words stick out more than others, and it's true, It it weren't for the worst people and moments and the rest, I would have stayed a little bird all my life.
And no; shes not the girl you knew, not after what shes seen, not after what they did to her. 
“Dying your hair doesn’t change anything, your place is in the North.”

I saw a message in a place away from here not so long ago that gave me slight hope, and I guess parts of me will always still be that silly little girl with silly dreams who never learns, because I had hope for a moment, that some of those little messages, were from you. Oh to wish on impossible things..

The ones that said about holding me through it, and yes you knew. 
One said there was no one else they’d rather give their last name to. 
One asked if I kept the letters. 
The latest said the poems written were beautiful and they never meant to cause any hurt. 
Some said to their warmest love, they hadn’t read or written until now but you deserve the peace of my absence, 
Another said real life over anonymous and you were there waiting. 
One said I’m stuck in your habits now I miss you and want to talk. 
Another said it still aches despite the years I wish you hadn’t left. 

The colours used, or the name/alias used, a few of those dark red ones even remembered the accent above my name, and only you and my father have ever remembered to use it correctly. I always adored you for that. 

There were many in fact, that were parallel to my own writing, and my own shorter messages I sent but only two have ever been posted. For the record mine was regarding the only exception, and another that it will always be you. Not so long after that, one was sent to my name, saying the same message. But I didn’t dare hope too much, not until this one; 

The one that said you’d be waiting for our pack. It felt so hauntingly like your voice, and perhaps it was indeed wishful thinking, but it gave me hope, that perhaps one day, you’d come back and take your place within the pack. 

But you never will, will you. No matter how much one hopes or wishes on impossible things. 

I’ll continue to love them, my people, and as you know, a mother always protects the pack. 
You will always have a space within it, should you ever chose it. 

I learnt long ago that lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice, you can find the chemistry but not the love and care as well, or you find the sweet nature but there’s zero chemistry. No, you only get that once, it hasn’t been for a lack of trying to find something even vaguely similar to what I felt with you, believe me I tried. 

You will always have a space, even in friendship, you have a place here. Much like the others who form that tribe, they all have a key and know where their personal bedding is everyone gets their own you see, all tailored to their personalised styles and tastes, their own bedding, their own towels, they all have their own wash kits here in the cupboard, everyone gets their own coffee or tea cup, they never need to ask beforehand they know they are all family and they can be here any time should they find the need to. The same extends to you, should you ever find yourself needing a moments rest or curiosity gets the better of you I don’t know.. but you have a key if you need it. You know where you can find us. I know you never will, but I’d hope that should you ever find yourself needing to get away, to rest somewhere peaceful, to be fed properly and gain a deep restful sleep, no questions asked, no conversation even required, I hope you would come here.

After reading that Wireguard can sometimes bypass captive portals, I tried it. Here's what worked for me on Mac/iPhone:

1. Use the IP address for the Wireguard server instead of a domain name
2. Use my own DNS (Adguard Home) self-hosted on my router, again accessing via IP address, using it in my client config
3. Use the standard UDP port

The process: Connect to the captive portal WiFi, close the captive portal browser window without log in, and then activate Wireguard. Now I get about 70Mb/s.

I suspect it works because it doesn't need to make any DNS resolutions for my Wireguard server, and they are not blocking UDP connections. Is my assumption correct?

In addition to that, steam started also coming out of the filter, just a few seconds after pressing the power button and the button lights get steady, like a type of leak of some sort, this same behavior happens also when I start heating milk with the steam dispenser, steam starts coming out of the diffuser.

Keep in mind that I keep the machine clean with regular descaling when the orange indicator starts showing.

***What I have done already, but didn't work :***

* descaling
* water tank has no leak
* water inlet valve seems to be okay ( from where the water is drawn under the water tank ) ""not sure if they are called like that""
* remove / clean diffuser
* Made sure there's no steam / leak inside the appliance
* purge the appliance from water and steam ( just removed water, and I emptied it through the dispenser until there was nothing left )

The video shows the steam and the excess water dripping, but also what to focus on, is the part that shows that there is air / pressure that keeps on pushing water inside the tube / pipe, even after a while of the shot being delivered. ( *Sorry for the poor quality* )

After checking a couple of videos and the official appliance flow, it seems to me the problem might come from the pressure valve or the pump, or both, it might even be a bad O-ring that's holding the pipe, but not sure what to replace exactly.

Also there's no official delonghi support / maintenance in my country, only retailers and I don't trust those.  
  
Any ideas / advice would be very helpful.

It seemed like everything was going fine, I was following my usual process - but the coffee just did not come through.  I tried again from scratch, but nothing. I had to start a meeting so I had to let it go this morning.  

I came back to it tonight checking everything on the pot, searching this sub and looking at various websites to try to figure out what's happening. I still don't know for sure, and will try again tomorrow reviewing each step. 

This search has left me with questions about the valve that cannot find an answer to. If I understand correctly, they should have a piston that comes out of the valve along its axis to release pressure if needed. Mine has a short moveable piston inside that does not protrude through to the outside. Many of the images of my pot show the same. Equally, images of the traditional mokapot clearly have the piston protruding to the outside. 

My question is whether I am viewing this correctly? Are the valves different depending on style or material,  or, is mine broken some how? 
(I've added some images to help illustrate my meaning.)

I met a girl at my gym back in September, and we started talking. After 2-3 days of chatting, I found out she had a boyfriend. But despite that, we made plans to go for coffee (it was a date). The date went really well, and we had fun. After I dropped her home, she texted me saying she was confused between me and her boyfriend. I told her it was her choice, but if she wasn't happy in her relationship, she should do what feels right.

She ended up meeting with her boyfriend, and she didn’t break up with him. However, I continued talking to her, and it seemed like we couldn’t really stay away from each other. She said she was emotionally cheating on her boyfriend with me, and that they were arguing because of me. According to her, they hadn’t talked in over a month.

I liked her, but this situation started to feel overwhelming, and I didn't want to be involved in a relationship where someone wasn’t being fully honest. So, I decided to block her.

I’m now questioning whether I made the right choice. Was it wrong of me to keep talking to her after I knew she had a boyfriend? And was blocking her the right decision?",0,1732792084.0,AmIOverreacting,12,0.5,False

It was fantastic!,"My vestibular symptoms significantly increased recently despite non-vestibular migraine symptoms being controlled well with Botox and nerve block and amitriptlyne. Did the VNG to rule out meniere and PPPD.

The test was not as negative as most people experienced. It was really light work! My doctor allowed me to take domperidone for nausea and asked me to not discontinue my long term benzo usage as it will hinder my health with withdrawal and likelihood of benzo withdrawal effecting the test is higher than actually continuing to use it -just avoid using it that morning of the test it possible, use it afterwards, as you want to come in with 0 ingested water and meds 6 hours before the test-, she said severe regulation of medications is counterproductive to VNG and there isn’t a universal guideline— it’s case specific and it shouldn’t be an all out destruction of vestibular suppressants when they are at low doses and can be avoided with their half life into consideration. Obviously had to stop Betahistine and Amitriptlyne for 5 days and coffee restriction for 24hrs and 6 hours of everything-fasting and 16hours of food fasting.

But lord, the test was light! Caused me a bit of dizziness. So light. Nothing like what I read or expected. I went for breakfast and a coffee afterwards, the test showed weakness in right side of vestibular function by 40%, which needs a certain betahistine + ginko bibola and vestibular rehab plan for 3 months then do the test again.. but more than happy to do it.


I have GAD, so my anxiety was through the roof.. I understand some people genuinely have a severe experience, but please do keep in mind that people who usually report their experiences are the ones with the most negative one. Most people seem to have it light. I have seen the patients from my doctor’s clinic. They all left feeling good and light so it wasn’t just me. If you have your VNG scheduled: don’t overstress. It is a needed test to avoid long term health complications and might save your life. Likelihood of a severe bad experience is very low.

A cafe where once in a while a loud unexpected violent boom occurs and the whole place shakes.,"This is to simulate what it's like to be near a missile strike while people are just trying to have a normal day. You'd never know when the next boom comes. The loudness should be up there to the legal limits. A sudden, violent boom. Good big loudspeakers, behind the walls even? Ask your local sound engineer about an authentic sound profile, watch some footage, collaborate with a military expert or an actual survivor. Also make some debris fall from the ceiling. Have some of the paintings fall on the ground at boom. The entire cafeteria should rest on a giant mechanical platform that can be shaken with a press of a button. If you want to be completely grim about it, some customers could be actors (students) and have them act like they're injured. Fake blood, screaming, crying, the whole works. ...should maybe just call it PTSD Cafe.

Challenges:

-Employees might get stressed out by the noise and vibration very quickly. They also can't give any clues to the customers when the next ""strike"" comes such as by leaving the place or by putting on ear protection. Unless they wear it all the time? Could still be too stressful. Possibly rotate employees frequently by design and accept the high turnover rate, and be open about it too.

-Lots of broken ceramic coffee and tea cups, even if cheap and covered by the ticket price. Maybe use only cardboard cups.

-Spilling hot beverages. Possibly don't serve them at all. Only cold drinks.

-Frequent clean-ups necessary.

-The falling debris should possibly be food safe because it's going to fall on everything. Possibly guarantee 5-10mins time for eating and drinking, after that it could boom at any moment, and then no eating allowed.

-Noise pollution to surrounding spaces. Should probably build the cafe in an isolated area with no adjacent businesses or homes. Thick sound insulation.

-Have the customers sign a waiver or something in case they somehow get injured. The customer should always be aware of what they're getting into. Maybe even have a medic on standby.",2,1732791924.0,CrazyIdeas,1,1.0,False

So much dereliction and boarded up retail units, but the ones that were open just seemed to be the same as so many other places, and had I not unfortunatly known I was in Clonmel, I could have told I was in a lot of towns in Ireland and would have beleived you based on the same shops you see in them all.

It seems like its generally a mixture of, Lifestyle sports, dealz, an off brand deals that seel a lot of greeting cards, holland & Barrett (or other chain health store), if you are lucky a pennys, easons, a generic mens clothing store and a womens store (probably Dv8 or something in that style), about 12 pubs, 5 pharmacies, a generic chain bakery serving overpriced sandwiches, a few chain take aways again a supoermac or macdonalds if your lucky and probably Lana as your asian option, 18 phone shops, a CEX, 9 Vape shops and the rest are barbers & nail salons. You then either have one one supermarket or supermarket overload with Alid, Lidli, 3 Dunnes & 2 Tescos all on top of each other.

There is obviously a few exceptions, and a lot of places do now have nicer coffee shops or trucks opening, but everything is just so generic in Ireland and everything seems like the same chain stores everywhere you go.

The UK is very much the same, but if you go to mainland europe, their towns and outside cities all seem very unique in their stores and cafes and everywhere feels like you step into somewhere new each time you go, where as here its the same group of shops almost everywhere.

Will honestly say I could be wrong here, maybe I dont spend enough time in these places to really find the unique places but it really seems like most of towns are just copy and pasted with the same stores and a ton of boarded up places not opened.",16,1732791904.0,AskIreland,29,0.68,False

**Synopsis:** This story is based on two theories. One, that if we flirt with someone continuously for 21 days, there will be a chance that that person will start to be interested back. Two, we're able to forget exes if we break up for 11 months. 

Nune likes Vicky, a customer of the coffee shop. Nune talks about Vicky to Pie (Ferin) every day, which makes Pie annoyed. So, she challenges Nune to flirt with Vicky for 21 days. Nune accepts and finds ways to flirt with Vicky. Nune also challenges Pie back to forget Vava (Great), her ex-girlfriend in 21 days, because in 21 days it will be 11 months. Pie accepts the challenge thinking it will be easy. But, on that day, Vava appears at the coffee shop.

21 days... with hearts that just want to get closer.

Why can't I drink specialty coffee but can drink donut shop, Starbucks, and dunkin?

I feel I need to explain a little on why I think this happens but I'm not 100% it's really the reason. I would really like to know if others have this problem.
So starting from the beginning, I've been drinking coffee since I was about 13, I'm currently 27. When I was about 24 or 25 I worked at Starbucks and my coffee consumption got a bit excessive. In a 4 hour shift I would drink roughly 12 shots of espresso, not just that, but blonde espresso which has way more caffeine. I would also regularly drink energy drinks a few times a week, so a lot of caffeine. I realized how bad it was getting and instead of cutting back I quit cold turkey. Now I never planned to stop for good, just wanted to reset my tolerance. 
Anyways, after about a month I was at work and it was a rough day so I drank 2 shots of blonde espresso. I ended up being sent home for projectile vomiting. I didn't realize this was because of the caffeine as I normally don't feel good because stress makes me physically sick(work stresses me out so badly). A few days later I drank an energy drink during a therapy appointment I only drank about half before I felt like throwing up. I had to pull over multiple times on my way home to throw up out my door. I realized I couldn't even drink a bottle of soda that contained caffeine. I could have just stayed off caffeine but I love drinks that contain caffeine. Eventually I started drinking half a bottle of soda and worked my way back up to being able to drink anything again, or so I thought.
But here's where my problem come in. I follow this family on YouTube who have a organic coffee business. They had mentioned how most coffee has mold and bugs in it and they talk about how big coffee businesses pay coffee farmers like shit. After doing my own research on big coffee brands, i wanted to try their company as they individually go through every bean, so no bugs and they pay over WAY over that amount to the small farms they buy from. I ordered 3 bags as it also gave you access to a coffee tasting stream where they go into detail about how to properly make pour over coffee.I tried it when it arrived and I had a reaction to the drink I made. I ended up going to the hospital becausemy throat was itchy and i was wheezing. (I'm highly allergic to hay and i was allergic to canola  oil for a few years so I knew I was having an allergic reaction) this reaction wasnt as bad as the two i just mentioned but i wanted to be safe not sorry. I thought the reaction may have been from the creamer I got, as I've never had it before so I didn't automatically think the coffee was at fault because i was already drinking other brands. A few days later I went to a Thai restaurant and ordered a Thai ice coffee as I've never tried it before and I had the same reaction as a few days prior. 

Since then I haven't drank any coffee outside starbucks, dunkin, and donut shop out of fear because the hospital said reactions can get worse the more times they happen( not the way they said it but I can't remember exact words).

when I was a young man
I felt these things were
dumb, unsophisticated.
I had bad blood, a twisted
mind, a precarious
upbringing.

I was hard as granite, I
leered at the 
sun.
I trusted no man and
especially no
woman.

I was living a hell in
small rooms, I broke
things, smashed things,
walked through glass,
cursed.
I challenged everything,
was continually being
evicted, jailed,in and
out of fights, in and out
of my mind.
women were something
to screw and rail
at, I had no male
friends,

I changed jobs and
cities, I hated holidays,
babies, history,
newspapers, museums,
grandmothers,
marriage, movies,
spiders, garbagemen,
english accents, spain,
france, italy, walnuts and
the color 
orange.
algebra angered me,
opera sickened me,
charlie chaplin was a
fake
and flowers were for
pansies.

peace an happiness to me
were signs of
inferiority,
tenants of the weak
an
addled
mind.

but as I went on with
my alley fights,
my suicidal years,
my passage through
any number of 
women-it gradually
began to occur to
me
that I wasn't different

from the
others, I was the same,

they were all fulsome
with hatred,
glossed over with petty
grievances,
the men I fought in
alleys had hearts of stone.
everybody was nudging,
inching, cheating for
some insignificant
advantage,
the lie was the
weapon and the
plot was
empty,
darkness was the
dictator.

cautiously, I allowed
myself to feel good
at times.
I found moments of 
peace in cheap
rooms
just staring at the 
knobs of some
dresser
or listening to the
rain in the 
dark.
the less I needed
the better I 
felt.

maybe the other life had worn me 
down.
I no longer found
glamour
in topping somebody
in conversation.
or in mounting the
body of some poor
drunken female
whose life had 
slipped away into 
sorrow.

I could never accept
life as it was,
i could never gobble 
down all its
poisons
but there were parts,
tenuous magic parts
open for the
asking.

I re formulated
I don't know when,
date, time, all
that
but the change
occurred.
something in me
relaxed, smoothed
out.
i no longer had to 
prove that I was a 
man,

I didn't have to prove
anything.

I began to see things:
coffee cups lined up
behind a counter in a 
cafe.
or a dog walking along
a sidewalk.
or the way the mouse
on my dresser top
stopped there
with its body,
its ears,
its nose,
it was fixed,
a bit of life
caught within itself
and its eyes looked 
at me
and they were
beautiful.
then- it was
gone.

I began to feel good,
I began to feel good
in the worst situations
and there were plenty
of those.
like say, the boss
behind his desk,
he is going to have
to fire me.

I've missed too many 
days.
he is dressed in a
suit, necktie, glasses,
he says, ""I am going
to have to let you go""

""it's all right"" I tell
him.

He must do what he
must do, he has a 
wife, a house, children.
expenses, most probably
a girlfriend.

I am sorry for him
he is caught.

I walk onto the blazing
sunshine.
the whole day is
mine
temporally,
anyhow.

(the whole world is at the
throat of the world,
everybody feels angry,
short-changed, cheated,
everybody is despondent,
disillusioned)

I welcomed shots of
peace, tattered shards of
happiness.

I embraced that stuff
like the hottest number,
like high heels, breasts,
singing,the
works.

(don't get me wrong,
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism
that overlooks all
basic problems just for
the sake of
itself-
this is a shield and a 
sickness.)

The knife got near my
throat again,
I almost turned on the
gas
again
but when the good
moments arrived
again
I didn't fight them off
like an alley 
adversary.
I let them take me,
i luxuriated in them,
I bade them welcome
home.
I even looked into
the mirror
once having thought
myself to be
ugly,
I now liked what
I saw,almost
handsome, yes,
a bit ripped and
ragged,
scares, lumps,
odd turns,
but all in all,

almost handsome,
better at least than
some of those movie

butt.

real feelings of
others,
unheralded,
like lately,
like this morning,
as I was leaving,
for the track,
i saw my wife in bed,
just the 
shape of
her head there
(not forgetting
centuries of the living
and the dead and
the dying,
the pyramids,
Mozart dead
but his music still 
there in the
room, weeds growing,
the earth turning,
the toteboard waiting for
me)
I saw the shape of my
wife's head,
she so still,
I ached for her life,
just being there
under the 
covers.

I kissed her in the,
forehead,
got down the stairway,
got outside,
got into my marvelous
car,
fixed the seatbelt,
backed out the
drive.
feeling warm to
the fingertips,
down to my
foot on the gas
pedal,
I entered the world
once
more,
drove down the 
hill
past the houses
full and empty
of
people,
I saw the mailman,
honked,
he waved
back
at me.",2,1732791342.0,SaudiReaders,0,1.0,False

Prepped everything from the cinnamon filling and vanilla batter. Na assemble ko na at naisalang sa oven. Then, it’s time to clean up.

Fast forward. We were kinda working on shit. I say kinda because we've taken steps forward and then he's taken steps back.

Anyway... the other day, my SIL messaged me. Telling me that a few months back... my husband was kinda getting into an RP chat with her. She's got a few screws loose and was trying to help him out thinking if he saw a sample chat it might help with our issues. However... he *engaged* with her. She shut it down and hasn't talked to him since. I wondered why they didn't talk anymore. I'm not mad at her. But when she told me. I freaking laughed. I did. Boy oh boy did I laugh. Here is he... acting like his nose is clean... claiming he's asexual left and right... but he's over here trying to get into sexting with my SIL... 🤦🏼‍♀️

I talked to him about it. And he legit told me ""it doesn't matter"". 😂 And I tried to tell him how I felt DOES matter. He's been gaslighting me left and right about all kinds of stupid shit for quite a while. This was no different. But yeah. Just needed to get this out there I suppose.

I thought with suffering with bad constipation that I'd test positive for methane as well but I never, some days my upper bloating is still really bad even on Rifaximin, could this be the bacteria die off releasing gasses? I'm just worried that because suffering with constipation while the Rifaximin is killing off the bad bacteria, is it a problem if I'm not getting it all out with good bowel movements? I don't want the bad bacteria to stay in me. I take Prucalopride and Dulcolax regularly but never helps me fully.

any advice on this is appreciated, I was going to try Metronidazole with Rifaximin but decided not too. would doing a colonic irrigation or coffee enema be a good idea at some point to do a good flush out ?

We barely texted, all he said was “make it back home safe?” and “i wish we finished what we started” since all we did at the party was kiss, but the next weekend he texted wya, i told him he could come over and we had sex. I told him i didn’t want it to be a one night stand and he seemed to agree. He then said he had to leave right away after. 

If that was it i would have understood he just wanted sex but he said he wanted to hang out and get coffee the next day. He never ended up texting me though. So i asked him to hang out the next week which he said Of Course to making it seem like the feeling was mutual. He said he was gonna be busy that whole week because of practice but next week he would have much more time. the next week rolls around and he texts me saying he got a concussion but he’ll be good in a week. the next week rolls around and i don’t get a text from him so i ask him if he feels any better, which he replies “better but still out of it.” i told him i hope u fully recover soon and told him how i was doing and he never replied and it’s been a week since that last message. 

First of all, regardless of whether he truly had a concussion or is just lying to not hang out why can’t he just be honest he doesn’t want to see me. even if he did have a concussion he wouldn’t leave me on delivered for a week if he was interested. 

So i got the hint, he doesn’t wanna see me again and isn’t interested. But the thing is i guess i got attached and he’s all i can think about. i know i gotta move on but it’s so hard. how do i detach myself from him and how do i stop checking my phone every 5 minutes to see if he texted me back. i know i deserve someone better so how do i move on. i think he’s lying about the concussion as an excuse to not hang out ",1,1732790321.0,dating,0,1.0,False

My son is 5 months old and we also have a 5 year old daughter. I have been a SAHM for 5 months now and things have been getting a lot harder. 

My boyfriend does not help much at all when it comes to the kids, I ask for very minimum since I know he is working and is our only income at the moment, but he does not respect me at all. He does not do anything but sleep and work Friday-Tuesday, on his days off he will help sometimes with chores but not much when it comes to the kids. Tonight i’ve basically reached my breaking point as i’ve not had more then 3-4 hours of sleep in months, it’s his day off and we have plans for the holiday tomorrow. He said he was going to bed around 11pm, my son has been sick and not sleeping until between 6-8am, so I asked him if he could take over around 4-5am so that I could sleep for a little also but he refused. He started asking why do I need sleep? I just stay home. He always says thing like “shut up, you’re home all day while i’m working” and it gets much worse. 

Everyday I bring him breakfast and coffee to wake him up for work, I pack him lunch to take and also make dinner for him to come home to. I clean the house by myself daily while taking care of both kids and their needs. I do not get any time to myself and I feel like i’m going crazy. 

He is always saying all the baby does is eat and poop so what is he supposed to do? 

I feel like i’m a single parent and even when I try to talk with him calmly, he gets mad and it turns into an argument. 

I’m also tired of hearing how i’m doing “nothing” all day when I am taking care of 2 kids, cooking, keeping the house clean. I’ve never spent more then an hour away from the kids and that is usually just the grocery store unless I take them with me. He will leave my son to cry anytime I am gone and does not care at all to take care of him.

I have no family close by and he is my only source of help, is there anything I can do to help him realize this is not fair? He always says how he needs to relax because he works, but according to him I don’t need anything because I am simply doing nothing.  

i love him and if i just go along with letting him sleep and work, relax on his days off or do things he likes to do, then we have no issues.

*Roughly translated.*

**with Prokop Jirsa**

**Q**: What were the challenges?

**Prokop**: People who modelled the city, they had unreal amount of work. Since first game, we want every character the most real possible. They do not just spawn around the corner, they have place to sleep, to work, to drink.

**Q**: What were the technical limits?

**Prokop**: The limit was to calculate certain amount of NPCs on certain area. We have very long streets, where you can see well into distance, we are trying to block it, so it does not distract player, but at the same time they can see into distance. We put little stores in these streets, it does not look strange.

**Q**: Is it a technical problem, NPCs do not spawn just for player?

**Prokop**: For example, there is a small village, there is a quest which changes the behavior of NPCs, example, we do not have it, but if the pub got burnt down, people will not go to it. It is easier to grip the village with 20, 30, 40 people, compared to the huge Kuttenberg, where...>!the whole district changes. People will stop going there.!<

**Q**: Can you think about things which make the game most realistic?

**Prokop**: There are many. It would be easy to speak about events. You do not only want to meet people going places, going shopping which is nice. We want something else happening. There is system which detects there are 2 NPCs which are going towards each other. They will start talking. For example, there can be 2 neighbors who hate each other and want to brawl. This one of many ways how it can make a world more fun.

**Q**: What is the best advantage of having big city?

**Prokop**: Esthetically, it is godlike. It is realistic and beautiful. We can show Czech history and architecture. You can go the walls and just look into distance, or go to Saint Jacob (church) and admire it.

There is a lot of honorable townsmen, craftsmen, who have real names, if we could find historical sources. We can make quests and stories which would otherwise seem weird.

**Q**: Why Kuttenberg yes and Prague no?

**Prokop**: Specifically for our game, Kuttenberg is historically important place where the story goes through. At the time, there was a civil war, it was difficult to control the city.

**Q**: What other city would deserve implementation?

**Prokop**: Prague, for sure. Czech Krumlov, I like it very much.

**with Jakub Kuneš and Tobias Stolz-Zwilling**

**Q**: How was the idea created to cooperate with Warhorse?

**Jakub**: We (Czech saving bank) are in gaming for 2 years now, and our dream was to connect with some Czech studio because we do not have a game product. We were talking about what gaming studio it should be, out of 10 people, 9 said Warhorse. Then we knocked on door to Tobias.

**Tobias**: Email was received one day. It is quite interesting. First reaction was: next. We thought what we should be doing there. Then we said why not. It was an honor this bank is interested in us. We thought it is good to connect one of the most influential gaming studio with one of the best banks here.

**Q**: How did you choose the design of cards?

**Tobias**: We had so many ideas and we said so many times, we finally got it, and somebody else came, the weapons, not so good. I think it was generally fruitful conversation. The cooperation was nice.

**Jakub**: I received email from Tobias, this is the best design. And then we got email, maybe we got something else. We only have 3 designs.

**Tobias**: These 3 is the culmination of the best designs. Somebody said if we could change weapons to baguettes, no we can not send it.

**Q**: Which is your favorite card?

**Jakub**: My favorite is called Adventurer (picture of Henry and Hans on horses).

**Tobias**: My favorite is maybe Adventurer.

**Q**: How did you choose merch to moneyback event?

**Jakub**: We wanted everything, the variety is important. Somebody wants mousepad... the choice is good.

**Tobias**: Typical fan is a collector. Xzone is a reliable partner.

**Q**: Did you play the first game?

**Jakub**: I just looked at it yesterday, I played it for 6 hours. It is difficult.

**Tobias**: Do not listen to him, KCD is not hard. When you know the game from inside out, the majority of developers did not play it. Unless they played it before coming to the job. I do not just turn it on and play it for 100 hours. I like when it releases. I enjoy watching people play it. How they play, whether they enjoy it, if they find jokes funny, if they find Easter eggs. In reality, I only played the game for 20, 30, 40 hours what I had to show to the journalists. I played 20 hours continually of KCD2. I tested the beginnings how it behaves. If it gives you enough info for the start.

**Jakub**: We are talking who is gonna take a day off on the day of release, so we are all planning to play it that day. Even if the combat system was too hard for me, I would appreciate just to wonder around Kuttenberg.

**Tobias**: You are saying, your bank will be putting PS5 consoles in all rooms with coffee machines?

**Jakub**: We are working on it.

**Tobias**: It is settled.",10,1732790062.0,kingdomcome,2,0.92,False

Isn't a favour ,"Dating is not a means to an end, it's supposed to be quality time with someone you like. It's supposed to fun for both parties and something your partner wants to do, because they should enjoy and want to spend time with you. If they have no problem going out and spending money with friends it should be the same for you. I've heard so many women say they're relationship of 3-6 months have never wanted to out on a date even when they've asked - if you're tolerating that I want you to know they're giving you the bare minimum and they don't actually like you. You are convienient, and they're dating you for ulterior motives because there's no way a person who actually likes a person would never want to leave the house with them, and says no to doing stuff with them even when they ask for it. I don't even do that to my friends. If someone likes you they want to make you happy, and 3 hours at a resturant really wouldn't feel that taxing. You're telling me you're in a relationship but he can't even muster up the effort to do something once in a while but finds the energy to go out with the boys same week? No... no he dosnt like you. 

And before anyone starts talking about finances coffee is cheap, the local museum or park or browsing at the mall is free. Darts and cocktails is under £20, split the bill 50/50.  If you have money to spend on new stuff, going out with your friends and other leisure activities you have the money you're just choosing not to spend it with your partner, so it's not about money, it's about you not wanting to doing activities with your partner- because you don't see them as a partner you see them as a resource of whatever you're using them for and you think your time and attention is the token that you put into their vending machine to get stuff out of them. They should not act like giving you time and attention is payment or labour.  ",8,1732790001.0,dating,1,0.84,False

After many hours spent on research, for the “best” grinder which suits me, I decided to buy the timemore 064s. Also wanna mention, that this is my first grinder, because I upgraded to a sage dual boiler and the timemore 064s, but this is another story to tell. 
So, my grinder arrived and I “seasoned” it with almost 2kg of coffee (I read that it needs some seasoning). After that I decided to disassembly the grinder, to clean out the burrs a bit, and also with that occasion, to allign the burrs. But when I got in the burrs chamber, I was surprised to see that there are some pins missing. I want to mention that the grinder works fine I guess, and already contacted the seller, but I’m on hold, because they don’t know for the moment what to do.
Did someone else encountered this issue? Or know if I can purchase those pins from somewhere else? Or worse, if there is a problem if the grinder ran without those pins in place.

1h1t350,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLegendborn/comments/1h1t350/my_speculations_on_how_brees_purple_power_would/,my speculations on how bree's purple power would be like: which majorly stems from when i was wondering how bree's power smells like and half the post is just that,"*^(\[spoilers for legendborn and bloodmarked, read at your own caution ;)\])*  
*^(\[also this is kinda copied from my tumblr because i wanted opinions so yeah\])*

so there are a few...things related to magic in the legendborn series; it's abilities, specialties, weaknesses, aftereffects, smells, color, common form etc etc so i wanted to make some headcanons which may or may not be true but yeah these are my thoughts;

so now that we are here, let us begin;

* her power is purple ~~as everybody and their mamas know~~ but just let's get into this?? purple has been like a symbol of yk *rarity and royalty* in literature since ages before, which goes perfectly with the fact that bree is our king. now since it is so rare her powers will have the usual and added benefits, which i have headcanoned before but i just wanted to put them in one place.
* firstly, aether was usually used to cast hard constructs, harder than diamond if needed, but selwyn has proved that aether could be forged into practically anything you wish to as long as you're capable and willing. so bree's power can surely be used like *an all-encompassing building block to forge everything from weapons to mundane things* like i said here. so this is aspect one.
* secondly, rootcrafting is mainly for healing and perseverance. so bree could now possibly have the ability to heal herself, and because she is seen to have at least some knowledge of medical field or can like basically guess which part is hurting and which one is not, i mean isn't it possible now she has her own *unlimited* (debatable since she collapsed after jessie healed alice but i have a point for that too??) *healing powers*?? surely she will be able to heal herself pretty fine, yk like a quick break between things because rootcraftng doesn't allow use of much power because it is borrowed but like now she has her own furnace so yeah.
* about the collapsing part, it is possible that because in legendborn she hadn't completely unlocked and accepted her powers yet, she was running on a limited-time root that was supposed to be an ""emergency"" supply. and also that it was used by someone else through her, she did not willingly give it like she did in bloodmarked (she wouldn't have refused to, just that she didn't realize quick enough what jessie meant when she said you'll have todo from your side so like kind of different from when she gave her root to selwyn) and in bloodmarked she also had like yk 70% set unlocked ig.
* thirdly, because these powers are now merged, it would be so badass if she is able to [actively defend herself ](https://www.tumblr.com/worth-this-and-more/762128137749512192/do-theory-about-rootcraft-in-oathbound?source=share)[*and*](https://www.tumblr.com/worth-this-and-more/762128137749512192/do-theory-about-rootcraft-in-oathbound?source=share)[ heal herself at the same time](https://www.tumblr.com/worth-this-and-more/762128137749512192/do-theory-about-rootcraft-in-oathbound?source=share), after mastering her control over powers now that arthur is no longer manipulating her with his ""too much aether, too fast"" strategy.
* along with this, we saw that bree's healing gave alice like permanent immunity from mesmer, either triggered by pain or just not able to stick properly in the head, but either ways *mesmers don't work now*. so after they all reunite, one task in her to-do list could be to have sel or anyone mesmer everyone and then to reverse the mesmer so that everybody now has immunity from mesmer. yk for future reference or relevance to the plot perhaps. and ofc you can't forget anna (nick's mom) i strongly believe her mesmer is gonna be broken by bree.
* also, ***THE DAGONNN***. so the question is about her fuel and sustenance, so like if she's in her dragon form can she eat what dragons eat (obviously meat i don't think vegetarian dragons exist?? and also does bree eat meat is this ever mentioned?? if not then i hope she eats meat she gonna need that protein to fly) will it affect her?? like in her human form ofc she wouldn't want to eat uncooked meat but like become a dragon breathe fire and you have your medium rare steak ready. is this possible. ~~same question for selwyn btw, can he eat worms in his owl form or does he like throw up after turning human or have food poisoning like is this a thing guys.~~
* anyways, back to topic, so these are like her abilities, but what about the physical descriptions?? now her rootcraft was mage flames, and aether was the solid armor construct. so her new powers could either be something in between or a combination that she can wield in whichever way she needs. technically it should be a combination, *harder constructs for weapons and armor, flames for large defense and flowy to make her own wards* (i mean she would need them sometime?? ig?? after they reunite and shit so yeah)
* and the smell, her new power should have different smells and purple is the rare royal color and hella nostalgic vibes there don't ask me why so here are my guesses;

1. *petrichor*; the smell of earth after the first rain. not exactly rare, but it is kind of a nostalgic smell that has been on earth hundreds of years even before humanity. like it ties with the fact that bree's power was more from the shadow king so the smell is also like yk ancient af.
2. i don't know the name but *the smell of salt on the beach, waves rolling in and the sprayed misty scent*. correspondence to, again, it has been here since ages and is one of the smells that has a different type of nostalgia. anybody who has ever been to a beach or water body will know but it just smells different.
3. now this one a kind of hard to explain but yk when you go to your grandparent's house, maternal grandparents, and it has like this distinct smell that is different for every family?? *the smell of generations of mothers growing up in the same house, like their childhood, puberty, old age everything in one place*. (yes i thought of this while i was at my own grandma's house and i wondered what it would be like if bree also had the chance to be in a house which had all the memories and elements of her line of mothers lives). it will be a difficult smell to explain because i do not have the proper vocabulary to say it but it is a guess of mine and probably possible.
4. yk that *very powdery smell of silk*?? the one that doesn't go away even after washing the cloth many many times, its very hard to explain but silk has been a major symbol of royalty in history (yk the silk road?? yeahhh) so it could also be one of the scents, depending on which type of royalty you mean.
5. i ran out of scents but you get the point now.

* now, weaknesses. i am hoping she doesnt have to like yk collapse after every fight, at least not until the adrenaline wears off. i hope her powerhouse can heal her and replenish her energy levels. at least for short term, like yk coffee makes you forget you're tired. not exactly good but will be good while she's on the run. may or may not happen but hey I'm just making theories.

this is all ig?? could make a pt.2 or add something here but yeah this is all i guess.",1,1732789661.0,TheLegendborn,0,1.0,False

Was it worth pushing it out a year or two just for the extra set of (mainly useless hands)? 

I’m currently 38 weeks pregnant with a 16 month old. I pay half the bills and more towards food and I cover all the toddlers needs like clothes, shoes, large purchase items to like her cot. We also live in my home I own and built SO rents his out. We moved in together before the first was born. 

My SO works from home. He does no yard work, doesn’t help with the pets or house work I do everything even heavily pregnant- think can’t help me carry in groceries or even put a used dish in the dishwasher lazy, does the bare minimum with the toddler - plays with her for half an hour and changes her into her pajamas. He will leave her in a shitty nappy and go shower himself, cook himself food and if I’m ever included it’s not enough for the toddler so I have to give her half of my portion. Won’t drop her or pick her up from daycare without a massive argument even when I was commuting two hours to work and do all the morning routines getting her ready (packed her bags, breakfast, change nappy, clothes, hair done etc). He has done nothing to prepare for this new baby or come to any of my appointments (I’m high risk). Talks down to me because I won’t give him sex anymore, make him a coffee on demand or do his seven month pile of laundry shoved in his filthy office. He sits on his phone and plays computer from morning till bedtime. 

Whenever he works interstate for a week or two my life and work load is lighter and easier, the toddler doesn’t notice he’s missing. If I wasn’t pregnant I would have no qualms of leaving and be able to do this on my own but I’m about to give birth, so I’m afraid I can’t manage this plus the extra workload completely on my own whilst breast feeding and finding a routine all over again to begin with. At the least I might get ten minutes in the shower or toilet with him around.

2g Nicotinamide (a non-flushing version of Niacin, vitamin B3) per day split into two doses. Helps alleviate anxiety and reduces my cravings for booze. 
MCT (C8) oil. Two tablespoons per day. 

Diet. 
I am eating a mainly carnivore diet and feel the benefits to my mental health are enormous.   I still have a few carb cravings that I am trying to remove, but that involves getting my blood sugar steady. 

At the moment, I buy 5kg of fatty beef brisket per week and freeze it in 700g portions. I cook it in a slow cooker, with half a glass of water, for four hours. I eat it as two meals, with some salt. I drink black coffee and black tea.   I am constantly reviewing and tweaking what I eat. 

Yes, the protein affects the absorption of Levodopa, but my mental health is a priority and I have no wish to go back to my old eating habits. Also there is soon the possibility of having Produodopa installed, this will avoid the problems associated with protein interfering with Levodopa. 

My aim is to be in ketosis as much as possible because I have had glimpses of what can be achieved. There have been times when I have been out walking and felt fabulous enough to miss a dose of Sinemet, I did not feel any PD symptoms at all, I felt normal. I am fairly certain I was running on ketones at those times.  The trick seems to be getting the level of ketones high enough. The idea is to bypass the problems with mitochondria associated with PD by generating energy using ketones.
