1q9e5rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indianbooks/comments/1q9e5rc/need_help/,Need help,"Chapter 1: The Alley at the End



“Every man believes he is free—until someone starts watching.”

December in the Himalayas didn't just bring the cold; it brought a heavy, suffocating silence. A white blanket of snow swallowed the sound of footsteps in Joshimath, mutting the world into a series of foggy breaths and crunching ice.

Kabir and Rishi walked with the practiced ease of locals, complaining about their shift manager’s ego to pass the time. To any onlooker, they were just two tired workers heading home at 6:30 PM. But Kabir’s rhythm faltered.

The air felt different. It wasn't the cold; it was the weight of eyes.

Without breaking his stride, Kabir bent down, fumbling with his laces. ""Don't look back,"" he muttered as Rishi slowed down beside him.
Rishi didn't need to be told twice. 

He caught the sharp, predatory glint in Kabir’s eyes. They didn’t head for their room. Instead, they cut toward a nearby café, the bell chiming a lonely note as they ducked inside.

They took a corner table—Kabir facing the glass, Rishi facing him. Two coffees sat steaming between them, untouched. Kabir’s gaze was fixed on a shadow across the street—a man in black attire, as still as a grave.

“You feel that?” Rishi’s voice was a low hum.
“Yeah. He’s been on us since the turn,” Kabir replied, his fingers drumming a restless beat on the table.
“Then why hasn’t he moved?”

Kabir’s lips pulled back into a grim smirk. “That’s what worries me. I don’t like being the mouse. Let’s go grab him.”

As they stepped back out, the atmosphere had shifted. The streetlights flickered with a dying buzz, and when Rishi checked his phone, the signal bars had vanished into thin air. The town felt hollowed out.

""It's too quiet,"" Kabir whispered, his hand sliding into his pocket where his brass knuckles waited. ""Joshimath doesn't sleep this early.""

They saw him then—the man in black—turning into a narrow alley that bled into the dark treeline of the forest. If he hit the woods, he was gone.
“He’s leading us,” Rishi warned, but he was already moving.

The alley was a throat of shadows. Light struggled to reach the center, leaving the two boys nearly blind as they pressed forward. They reached the midpoint and stopped, the silence pressing against their eardrums.

Flick.

A small orange flame bloomed in the darkness. It illuminated a sharp jawline and the tip of a cigarette. The man exhaled a plume of grey smoke that swirled around his face like a shroud.

""I'm Mr. K,"" the man said, his voice smooth and dangerously calm. ""How’s life, boys? What are you up to these days?""

Rishi didn't flinch. He stepped forward, his voice steady. ""No need to waste words on someone of your vintage, old man."" He gave a sharp nod. Kabir’s hand came out of his pocket, the brass knuckles glinting dully, while Rishi snapped open a pocket knife.
Mr. K didn't move. He just took another drag. ""Two brats itching for a fight. I'd suggest you watch before you act.""
Kabir let out a jagged snarl. ""You listening to this geezer? By the time I'm done breaking your jaw, you'll be begging to answer our questions.""

""You have two options here,"" Mr. K continued, ignoring the threat entirely. ""The first: follow every order I give, and you might just survive the night.""

""The second option is your grave!"" Kabir barked.

He lunged, but stopped dead. A sudden, freezing draft hit the back of their necks. It was the unmistakable sensation of someone—something—standing inches behind them.

They spun around, weapons raised, but the space was empty. The alley was a dead end. There was no rustle of clothing, no sound of retreating footsteps. Whoever had been there had vanished like a ghost in the fog.

In the silence that followed, the only thing they could hear was the slow, rhythmic ticking of Mr. K’s lighter. They weren't the hunters anymore. They were the ones in the cage.

Photography where I can also do a little hiking and take a nice landscapes, sunsets, or other nature shots.  While I enjoy golf, but I’m not very good at it.  I enjoy the game and play purely for the fun of it.  Its like a nice walk a park where I can lose golf balls, and make the occasional lucky shot keep that leads me to believe I can play the game.

The most promising options for my account were skirk and ineffa.
Let's not focus much about ineffa because she's not completing a single team in my account, and I don't need a wheelchair to clear content.(still, I kinda like her).

As for the second option, I was thinking about skirk. I've been playing her for a while when I played on my friend's account at his house, and she's pretty fun.

I have a team already prepared for her: a c6 furina is certainly doing a lot to improve her damage while also adding hers. I already have her best teammate(lady coffee) with homa, and both shenhe, citlali, and yelan ready for her to use. I also have mistplitter ready to be used by her.

Everything seems perfect to take her in my account, and I think she could easily take the spot of the strongest dps in my account.

Now 15 weeks pp not on birth control or anything regulating my hormones/chemicals or whatever I just feel like I’m back to feeling like I’m fighting so hard to just be okay with living life. Feels like I’m working so hard to be happy. It’s like my brain is a generator that’s on during a hurricane trying to keep the power (my mood) up/on. 

Also the little things just set me off. It’s like if I don’t have time in the AM just to zen for 10 minutes my whole day goes to crap. Like this morning walking my dog to go pee she heard sirens so she wanted to rush back inside before going poop. So that made me mad because my husband had to leave for work so that means if I wanted to let my dog out again because she didn’t fully go to the bathroom I would have to strap the baby to me and then walk the dog -_- so that put me in a horrible mood. 

All this happening before I could even sip some coffee. Or get the crust out of my eye. 

Then my husband got irritated because he felt like he was my punching bag when really I am just emotionally sensitive. I need zen time to fully be prepared for what the day entails. I know it sounds minuscule but it’s the truth. I need a good amount of time to get myself together so I can then push through the whole day of taking care of baby, taking care of dog, trying to clean the house (we just moved this week) and then somewhere some point feed myself because I’m breastfeeding so my normal fasting is non existent.

I'm a 21-year-old woman and a complete introvert. I get overwhelmed by large groups, loud environments, and too much small talk, and I genuinely recharge best when I have time alone or with just one or two people I feel safe around. I've grown comfortable with this part of who I am, but over time I've started longing for someone who shares the same preference for calm and depth. Someone I can connect with gradually, without the expectation of being outgoing or constantly active.

I'm in my third year of college right now, mostly focused on my studies and the small routines that keep me grounded. In my free time I read a lot (literary fiction, quiet mysteries, or anything with complex inner lives), watch films and series that feel thoughtful and atmospheric, listen to gentle music like indie folk, ambient, or soft piano while I write in my journal or sketch simple things. I like brewing coffee or tea slowly, taking walks when the world is quieter, collecting quotes or passages that move me, and spending hours lost in my own thoughts. Busy social scenes, parties, and endless plans make me feel drained quickly. I prefer peace, space, and moments that don't demand performance.

I'm not searching for someone who wants to pull me out of my comfort zone or make me more social. What I'm hoping for is another introvert who naturally gets it. Someone who finds comfort in silence, who would rather have one long, honest conversation than a lot of surface-level ones, who enjoys simple shared activities like reading in the same room, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something meaningful together, or just talking about life when the mood strikes. I think two introverts can create something really calm, respectful, and profound because we both understand the need for personal space and the value of choosing closeness intentionally.

I'd like to connect with guys around 20 to 26 who also identify strongly as introverted. You don't have to be extremely reserved or awkward, just someone who feels most themselves when things are low-key, who thinks deeply, and who appreciates quality time over quantity. Long distance is completely fine if we communicate well and the connection feels real and worth the effort.

If this sounds like your kind of quiet, please feel free to message me. Tell me a little about yourself, perhaps what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been meaningful to you lately, or what a peaceful day looks like for you. There's no pressure to reply fast or be particularly chatty at first. We can take it as slow as we both need, starting small and seeing if it grows naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel shared and a little less lonely. Thank you for reading.",0,1768075502.0,IntrovertDating,2,0.5,False

spent the last year diving deep into behavioral psychology research, listening to podcasts from neuroscientists like Andrew Huberman, reading books on habit formation, and talking to therapists. here's what nobody tells you: the habits that are quietly destroying your life don't look dangerous. they look normal. they look like what everyone else is doing.

the problem isn't that you're lazy or weak. it's that we're swimming in a society that's literally engineered to exploit our psychological vulnerabilities. social media algorithms designed by the smartest engineers at Stanford to hijack your dopamine system. work cultures that glorify burnout. food companies that hire neuroscientists to make products addictive.

but here's the thing. once you understand the mechanics behind these traps, you can actually do something about it.

# the habits that are quietly destroying you

**constant digital grazing**

your brain wasn't built for the amount of context switching you're doing. every time you check your phone between tasks, you're not just losing 10 seconds. research from Dr. Gloria Mark at UC Irvine shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully return to a task after an interruption.

you're basically running your brain on dial up internet while everyone else is using fiber optic. the cumulative effect is that you're operating at maybe 40% capacity without even knowing it.

what actually works: set specific times to check notifications. i know it sounds impossible but start with batching email checks to three times per day. your brain will fight you on this because it's literally addicted to the variable reward schedule of notifications, same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive.

**using substances to regulate your nervous system**

i'm not talking about being an alcoholic or drug addict. i'm talking about needing coffee to wake up, needing alcohol to relax, needing weed to sleep, needing sugar to feel good. you're outsourcing your nervous system regulation to external chemicals.

Dr. Anna Lembke's book ""Dopamine Nation"" explains this perfectly. she's Stanford's addiction medicine chief and the book breaks down how we're all basically running from pain and chasing pleasure in ways that make both worse. every time you use a substance to change your state, you're training your brain that it can't handle that state naturally.

the dopamine deficit you create requires bigger hits next time. it's not dramatic, it's gradual, but five years from now you literally won't be able to function without these crutches.

try this instead: learn actual nervous system regulation techniques. the Insight Timer app has free guided breathwork sessions that genuinely work. box breathing for two minutes does what coffee promises but never delivers, actual sustained energy without the crash.

**chronic people pleasing**

this one's subtle as hell. you're not helping people because you want to. you're helping because you're terrified of disappointing them. you're morphing yourself into whatever version gets approval.

here's what the research shows: people pleasers have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and autoimmune disorders. your body keeps the score when you're constantly betraying yourself. Dr. Gabor Maté talks about this extensively in his work on trauma and disease.

the fucked up part is that people pleasing doesn't even make people like you more. it makes them respect you less. they can sense the inauthenticity, even if they can't name it.

boundary work is uncomfortable but necessary: start saying no to one small thing per week. not rudely, just honestly. ""i don't have capacity for that right now"" is a complete sentence. watch how nothing terrible happens.

**comparison scrolling**

you're measuring your behind the scenes against everyone else's highlight reel. but it goes deeper than that. social comparison isn't just making you feel bad, it's literally preventing you from figuring out what you actually want.

when you're constantly looking sideways at what everyone else is doing, you never look inward. you end up chasing goals that aren't even yours. you're running someone else's race.

Cal Newport's book ""Digital Minimalism"" breaks down why this is so destructive. he's a computer science professor at Georgetown and argues convincingly that we're not using technology intentionally, we're letting it use us. the book gives you a framework for taking back control.

practical fix: delete social media apps from your phone for 30 days. keep the accounts, just remove the apps. use the browser version if you absolutely need to post something. the friction of logging in manually will reveal how much of your usage is just mindless habit.

**ignoring your body's signals**

you're tired but you drink caffeine. you're full but you keep eating. you need to pee but you finish the email first. you're in pain but you push through.

every time you override your body's signals, you're training yourself to disconnect from internal wisdom. over years, this creates a profound alienation from yourself. you literally stop knowing what you need.

Bessel van der Kolk's ""The Body Keeps the Score"" is THE book on this. he's a trauma researcher who shows how disconnection from your body is at the root of most psychological suffering. insanely good read that will make you question everything you think you know about mental health.

For anyone wanting to actually internalize this stuff instead of just reading and forgetting, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books like the ones mentioned here. Built by former Google AI engineers, it generates personalized audio content based on whatever you're struggling with, whether that's boundary setting, nervous system regulation, or breaking digital addiction patterns.

You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and research backing. The adaptive learning plan evolves as you interact with it, so it's not just random content, it's structured around your specific goals. What makes it less annoying than other learning apps is you can pause mid-session to ask questions or explore tangents, kind of like having an actual conversation about the material.

start small: set a timer to check in with your body every two hours. pause and scan from head to toe. what sensations are present? what's your body asking for? sounds woo woo but this is backed by decades of somatic psychology research.

**living in preparation mode**

you're always getting ready to start living. once you lose the weight. once you get the promotion. once you find the relationship. once you have more money.

meanwhile years are passing and you're not actually present for your life. you're in this perpetual state of not good enough yet.

this is what psychologists call ""arrival fallacy."" the belief that reaching some external milestone will fundamentally change how you feel. but research on lottery winners and people who achieve major goals shows happiness returns to baseline within months.

the shift: start treating today as if it matters. not in some carpe diem cliche way, but in the sense that this is actually your life happening right now. the promotion might not come. the weight might not come off. then what? you'll have wasted years waiting for permission to enjoy being alive.

these aren't dramatic interventions. you're not going to overhaul your entire life overnight. but if you pick one or two of these and actually implement them, six months from now you'll barely recognize yourself.

1q9dyyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1q9dyyd/6_secret_habits_that_make_every_man_more/,6 secret habits that make every man more attractive: the psychology that actually works,"I've spent the last two years digging through research papers, interviewing dating coaches, and consuming every piece of content I could find on male attractiveness. Not the surface level ""hit the gym bro"" advice everyone parrots, but the psychological mechanisms that actually make women notice you. This post pulls from evolutionary psychology research, relationship science, and interviews with actual women about what catches their attention.

Here's what nobody tells you: attractiveness isn't about your genetics. It's about behavioral patterns that signal high value. And most guys are sabotaging themselves without realizing it.

**1. Stop seeking approval from anyone**

This is the foundation everything else builds on. When you constantly check if others are watching you, laughing at your jokes, or validating your existence, it broadcasts insecurity. Women can smell this from a mile away.

Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that self-assured behavior (not arrogance) triggers attraction responses. It signals you have options, resources, emotional stability.

Start small. Make decisions without polling your group chat. Order what you actually want at restaurants. Disagree when someone says something you don't align with. The goal isn't to become a contrarian asshole, it's to demonstrate you have an internal compass.

**2. Develop a singular obsession outside of women**

Pickup artists got one thing right: women are attracted to men who are attracted to something other than women. When you're genuinely passionate about woodworking, Brazilian jiu jitsu, building a business, learning languages, whatever, you become magnetic.

Dr. Maryanne Fisher's research on male attractiveness found that dedication to mastery signals resource acquisition ability and focus. These are evolutionary triggers that haven't disappeared just because we invented Tinder.

Pick something that genuinely interests you and go annoyingly deep on it. Read the technical manuals. Join the online communities. Bore your friends talking about it. This authentic enthusiasm creates an energy that people want to be around.

**3. Learn to hold eye contact past the comfort zone**

Most guys break eye contact the second it feels slightly uncomfortable. This is a mistake. Holding eye contact 2-3 seconds longer than feels natural does something powerful to human psychology.

Studies on nonverbal communication show extended eye contact triggers dopamine release and increases feelings of attraction and connection. It signals confidence and creates intensity that's rare in our screen addicted world.

Practice with everyone: baristas, coworkers, random people on the street. Make it a game. You'll notice people suddenly seem more engaged with you, more interested in what you're saying.

**4. Slow down your speech and movements**

Anxious people move fast. Secure people move deliberately. This is universal body language that everyone unconsciously reads.

Research from Stanford on nonverbal status cues found that slower, more controlled movements signal higher social status and confidence. Fast, jerky movements signal anxiety and low status.

Next time you're talking to someone attractive, consciously slow down. Take pauses before answering questions. Move with intention instead of fidgeting. Walk like you own the space you're in but aren't trying to prove anything.

The book ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down how Silicon Valley executives use these techniques. She's worked with everyone from Fortune 500 leaders to military commanders. Her framework on presence, power, and warmth completely changed how I show up in social situations. The section on deliberate pacing alone is worth reading twice.

**5. Build genuine friendships with women**

This sounds counterintuitive but having female friends (that you're not trying to sleep with) dramatically improves your attractiveness to other women. It provides social proof, helps you understand female psychology, and removes the desperate energy guys carry when they only interact with women they want to date.

Anthropological research shows humans are hardwired to trust preselection. When women see other women enjoy your company platonically, it signals you're safe, socially calibrated, and not a creep.

Join co-ed sports leagues, hobby groups, or use apps like Meetup to find social circles. Genuinely invest in these friendships without ulterior motives. The secondary benefits will shock you.

**6. Develop a morning routine that's non-negotiable**

How you start your day determines your energy, confidence, and presence for the next 16 hours. Most guys wake up, scroll their phone, and wonder why they feel like shit.

The app Ash (mental health and habit coaching) has this incredible morning routine builder that helps you stack behaviors. Sounds basic but the consistency compounds into unshakeable confidence.

Another app worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning platform that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it creates adaptive learning plans based on your goals. 

You can customize everything from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and pick voices that match your mood (including that smoky, sarcastic tone that makes early mornings less painful). The virtual coach avatar actually learns what resonates with you over time. It's been solid for replacing doomscroll time with something that actually improves communication and social skills.

Another solid option is Finch, it gamifies habit building through a virtual pet that grows as you complete tasks. Weirdly effective for making boring routines addictive.

Create a 30-60 minute morning sequence that's sacred. No phone, no emails, no distractions. Mine is: cold shower, 10 minutes meditation, coffee while journaling three things I'm grateful for, then 20 minutes reading. This sets an internal state that radiates throughout the day.

""The 5 AM Club"" by Robin Sharma changed my entire perspective on mornings. He's a leadership expert who's advised billionaires and elite performers globally. The book argues that the first hour of your day is the most valuable 60 minutes you own. His formula for optimizing that hour is legitimately life changing. Plus the framework around neurochemistry and peak performance is backed by actual science, not just motivational fluff.

The truth is, attractiveness is a skill you build through deliberate practice. It's not about becoming someone else, it's about removing the layers of conditioning and anxiety that hide your natural magnetism. These habits work because they address the root psychological patterns that either attract or repel people.

Start with one habit. Master it for 30 days before adding another. Small consistent improvements compound into transformative results over months and years. The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is right now.",1,1768075277.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False
1q9dxdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticPeeps/comments/1q9dxdj/dating_and_trying_not_to_beat_myself_up/,"Dating, and trying not to beat myself up","Hey guys.

Generally, I try not to voice my issues in subreddits like this. I try and leave the space for the people who have far more severe daily issues than I do. I’m very fortunate. For context, I live in the UK, and have very low support needs. In my diagnostic letter, for my own edification and research I was informed that I land in the arena of what used to be called Asperger’s. I’m generally doing pretty good these days. I had a rough few years (drug problems, emotionally bereft and not understanding what was wrong with me, etc) but I have a nice life. I have a good job, a good living space, I have hobbies and interests and good friends.

So, last Monday, I went on a date. And honestly, I thought I went really well. It turns out she shared a lot of my interests, and she was autistic too! Great! We had a nice dinner. We talked for ages, she asked me to text her when I got back. It was honestly the most myself I’ve ever been in that kind of setting. 

Since then, no response.

And don’t get me wrong, but the part of my brain that stays rational knows that’s just what dating is. Sometimes, one party doesn’t click. I know that. I get it.

And I thought I was fine with it, because unfortunately I seem to never get that I take a while to actually feel how I’m feeling. But today it’s kind of hit me, and I’m having to be aware of some pretty negative thought patterns that I’m trying to avoid.

See, I mentioned earlier that it was the most myself I’ve ever been in this setting, which means, yeah, there was moments of awkwardness. Nothing serious, and I feel like that’s normal for a first date, but generally conversation felt pretty fluid. What hurts is that a younger me, masking both myself and my addiction to high heaven, while being completely emotionally devoid, had a very good track record in dating. Don’t get me wrong, I was a non-committal apathetic dick, but it hurts to know that I have it in me to be charming but not as much if I’m being fully myself.

And the worst part is obviously that I thought it went well. If there was some closure from the other side, it’d be easier to just draw a line under it. A message saying “sorry, didn’t feel it”. But unfortunately, there isn’t.

Practically all my ability to socialise is based on hyper analysing people around me and trying to work out if I’m doing the right thing. It’s why I steer clear of large groups these days, and why I had to be drunk to be in them in earlier life. So when I dont have certainty about how an interaction went, I start micro analysing myself and wondering where I messed up. 

Again, I logically know I probably didn’t. But because on the day I was certain it went well, now it’s thrown me into whack. And since I went in as myself authentically, it means I have to beat back all the potential thoughts that the authentic me is something inherently unloveable, that I’m too strange or awkward for anybody to want to be with the real me. This is nonsensical, and I know that. But today it’s just a feeling that’s hit me pretty strongly.

I know that’s silly, but I just needed to scream into a void of people who’d get it. I’m going to an NA meeting in a bit, and I’ll talk to people in person (there’s a fellow who’s quite a bit older than me and autistic at the meeting I’m going to, and we’ll probably grab coffee and talk it out), so I’m gonna be all fine. And once I’ve had a little mope, I’ll dust myself off and try again.

But sometimes, it sucks to feel like, and frankly be reminded that, being yourself is something wrong, or something that hinders you in so many ways. Because now that I’m clean, I don’t really know any other way to be.

I don’t wanna whine too much. I definitely don’t want any of the people here for whom dating is a fundamental impossibility to feel like I’m being too “woe is me” about what is a VERY first world problem. 

I just wanted to write down in words that I’m feeling a little sad, and a little reminded that my gauge on situations like these is just all out of whack.

Cheers for reading if you did.

1q9dwl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1q9dwl0/is_there_such_thing_as_very_mild_pots/,Is there such thing as very mild POTS?,"Hello everyone, I am not diagnosed with POTS but I've suspected for years that I might have either something very similar or a very mild case but my doctor is unconvinced that I should be tested because I've never fully passed out before.

I'm wondering if anyone diagnosed with POTS can relate to my ""presentation"" of symptoms.

🔴🔴 Some of the POTS symptoms that I experience can be explained by my other health conditions such as:🔴🔴


🔴 Brain fog/Light-headedness/dizziness can be either from:

. Fibromyalgia

.ADHD effecting my sleep

. Generalized anxiety disorder causing tunnel vision/blurred and stress so my mind is muddled

. Being overweight - if I'm moving a lot I can get light-headedness, shortness of breath and heart beating fast because I'm out of shape. I can feel shakiness or like I'm unstable on my feet when I'm doing a lot of walking and physical labor. 

But I have occasionally experienced vertigo enough to require laying down. 


🔴 Severe temperature disregulation and heat intolerance: 

. Erythromelalgia 

. Raynaud’s phenomenon 

. Fibromyalgia 

. Obesity 

. Medication side effects 


🔴 Chest pain: 

. I suspect I experience recurrent costroconitis and/or slipping rib syndrome related to my hypermobility 


🔴 Blood pooling/swelling in my hands and feet can be: 

. Raynaud’s phenomenon 

. Erythromelalgia (not officially diagnosed by a specialist but I'm on a waiting list for a specialist and my regular doctor is convinced) 

When blood pools my hands and feet swell to the point that I cannot wear rings and my footwear feels uncomfortably tight. My hands feel pathetically weak and bending my fingers feels so swollen like I'm wearing thick gloves. 


🔴 Digestive issues: I am chronically bloated, gassy and overall feel chronically ill

. I have severe IBS/GERD

. ADHD 

. Fibromyalgia 

. PCOS - looking into bowel endometriosis as well with my gastroenterologist 


🔴 Excessive sweating:

. Erythromelalgia 

. Fibromyalgia 

. Obesity 

. Multiple of my medication side effects 

. Generalized anxiety disorder 


🔴 Chronic Fatigue: 

. Fibromyalgia 

. ADHD & poor sleep hygiene 

. Generalized anxiety disorder effecting my sleep hygiene 

. Chronic pain from Fibromyalgia, Myofascial Pain Syndrome, Hypermobility strain, IBS/GERD, PCOS, Erythromelalgia, Raynaud’s phenomenon, back pain from obesity and weak ankles causing back misalignment, recurrent severe mysterious chest pain either costroconitis and/or slipping rib syndrome...all effecting sleep hygiene 


🔴 Heart palpitations: 

. I don't know if its palpitations or a fluttering feeling that very well could be a spasm in my esophagus or something but it feels like my heart or in the center of my chest. When it happens in my chest I also feel it in my neck around the lympnodes and it makes my inner ears pulse and ring with each pulse and sometimes my eyes makes the light look like it's flickering. I occasionally get random muscle spasms all over my body either feeling like a fluttering feeling or a Charlie horse. 



🔴🔴WHY I THINK I HAVE A MILD CASE OF POTS: 🔴🔴

. Every so often if I've been sitting for a while or laying down and I get up and stretch I will suddenly get completely blank minded, stop hearing and I'll flop over onto the ground. It's been happening since high-school and I'm now 30. I do not lose consciousness, I just got blank minded and my body is numb. I don't think I drop like a rock though, I seem to be able to fall in a way that I'm subconsciously catching myself to avoid injuries. Either it's a subconscious thing from years as a figure skater as a kid trained to fall safely or it's because I'm 5'2"" so the ground isn't that far anyway or because it often happens near a couch or chair or bed I'm able to fall back down on those things. Once my father witnessed me get up from the couch, stretch and then completely flop over onto the coffee table scattering the magazines and remotes and then land on my back on the floor and just lay there for what feels like a full minute until my mind wakes up again and I have feeling in my body again but it might only be 5 seconds. I brought it up with my childhood doctor and he said it's just because I'm short so I'm getting a head rush... I will also see stars floating around in my eyes. I know a lot of short people and this doesn't happen to them.

. I get this weird phenomenon where when I'm up and down a lot (for example, I'm vacuuming and I'm looking under stuff and then standing up then bending over a lot) and I'll get super lightheaded/dizzy and I'll feel this pulsing feeling in my inner ears, behind my eyes and in my neck around the lympnodes. It doesn't feel consistent like with my heartbeat per say, it feels like an irregular heartbeat but I've had heart tests for a separate issue (we suspect recurrent costroconitis) and I don't seem to have an irregular heartbeat or a murmur or anything. When this pulsing happens I get something like tinnitus but not like a constant ring but a ring with each pulse. When I feel the pulsing in my eyes I'll see stars floating around in my eyes or it's like the lights seem like they are flickering subtly. It usually goes away if I lay down flat for 20-30 minutes. I've been to an ENT to test my balance and inner ear conditions and everything has been ruled out in regards to these specific symptoms and a MRI of my head and neck didn't reveal anything. I'm not sure if I have experienced the Tilt table test when the ENT was testing my inner ear and balance. 

. Sometimes I'll just randomly start seeing stars but it happens more frequently with the above scenarios but also if I've experienced a shock or I'm having an anxiety attack. 

. I suspect I might possibly have Sjögren’s syndrome (which can be related to POTS) but it very well could be just side effects of some of my prescription medications and generalized anxiety disorder but it's chronic and incredibly inconvenient and irritating because I need to have water and candies on me at all times and in the middle of conversations with people which stresses me out further. 

. I suspect I might have mild MCAS (also related to POTS) but my allergenist wasn't convinced to test further but I have a long list of seasonal and chronic allergies plus oral allergy syndrome and food allergies and digestive issues 

. I have not been tested for Celiac Disease (also related to POTS) but I have a gluten intolerance and live like I do have Celiac Disease.

. My legs and occasionally my arms fall asleep every day, sometimes multiple times a day if I'm sitting on a harder chair or the toilet and if I'm laying on my side both arms can become completely uncomfortably numb. 

. I have hypermobility spectrum disorder, potentially even EDS or HEDS but my doctor is reluctant to investigate further because I don't have a history of frequent dislocations. EDS is related to POTS 






Does anyone else relate to these symptoms? Should I push further for a diagnosis with my doctor?

1q9dvc8,https://i.redd.it/l88gm7fuukcg1.jpeg,What a day…I didn’t see this one coming,"Part One — The Barbershop

Yesterday didn’t start out as anything special.
It was just a normal day.
A get-your-shit-done kind of day.
I needed a haircut and a shave. My beard was out of control, my hair looked like I’d stopped caring, and I knew if I didn’t deal with it I’d spend the whole day thinking about it. So I did what I usually do — routine.
Coffee.
Maybe a donut if I’m feeling reckless.
A podcast on the drive.
Lately it’s Billy Corgan’s. I like the range of guests, and as far as I’m concerned, the guy’s got Hall of Fame credibility with the numbers to back it up.
The barbershop is in Maywood. I love that town. I love the market there. I love this barbershop. It’s old school. No appointments. You sit. You wait. There’s a bell on the door. Radios playing. Strangers becoming familiar for ten minutes at a time. I’ve written about that place before.
So I’m sitting in the chair.
My guy starts in.
The door opens.
The bell rings.
We both glance over. Just another guy walking in, taking his jacket off. Nothing unusual. I turn back to the mirror.
Then I hear someone say,
“Tim?”
That alone throws me. Not many people call me Tim. Most people call me Gamble.
I look over.
And there he is.
Stephen.
Patrolman Stephen Gildea.
The police officer who saved my life. 
Not in uniform, not working just doing what I’m doing.
There was no big cinematic moment. No slow motion. Just instant recognition. My emotions didn’t build — they hit all at once. I couldn’t stop it.
We exchanged a few normal words.
Merry Christmas.
Happy New Year.
How are you?
He sat down in the chair behind me.
My barber, being as good as he is, could feel something heavy had just walked into the room and gave me a second.
When he came back, I said it out loud.
“That guy sitting behind me saved my life.”
When I died, my wife tried CPR. It wasn’t working. I was upstairs, collapsed on a bed. She couldn’t move me. She couldn’t get me flat enough to do compressions the way they needed to be done.
In that moment, Kate made a decision that saved my life — she called 911.
If panic had taken over for another few seconds, I’m not here.
Stephen and his partner, Detective Sergeant Douglas Kearns, showed up in four minutes.
Four.
They got me off the bed. They had a defibrillator in their car — something that was brand new to our department at the time. In under twenty minutes, they got my pulse back.
And this part matters:
If, when that call came in, they hesitated — even a little — I’m not here.
If they didn’t move as fast as they did, I’m not here.
If after fifteen minutes they stopped three seconds earlier and gave up, I’m not here.
That’s just the truth of it.
They kept me alive long enough for EMTs to get there.
Long enough to get me into an ambulance.
Long enough for Kate to get to the hospital.
Long enough for everything else that came after.
When I finished up, I went to grab my jacket. Stephen was already at the counter paying.
Something in me moved before my brain could get involved.
“No no no — I’ve got this.”
Immediate panic on his face. Total discomfort.
“I can’t let you do that.”
“I know you don’t want me to,” I said. “But please. It would really make my day.”
He finally let me.
I told him I wave every time I see a police car in town — even though the windows are blacked out and there’s no way to tell who’s inside — just in case it’s him or Doug. I told him I always worry someone’s going to think I’m flipping them off.
We laughed.
Then he said something I wasn’t ready for.
“Doug and I talk about you all the time.”
I froze.
He told me they still talk about my tattoo — the one over the left side of my chest that says Fight the Fight. When you’re giving someone chest compressions, it’s impossible to miss. They noticed it while they were working on me. They talked about it afterward. They still talk about it now.
I shook his hand.
I hugged him.
I told him to be safe.
And he left.
I turned around and my barber was staring at me with tears in his eyes.
I said to him: there’s no book, no article, no therapy session that could’ve prepared me for that. The oldest trick in the book still works —
Go out into the world.
Talk to people.
Be human.
There is no replacement for that.
The bell rang again as the door closed behind him.
I stood there for a second, breathing, getting my feet back under me, before stepping out into the rest of the day.
And that’s where the day could have ended.
But it didn’t.
Because somehow, impossibly, it was only halfway over.

The sidewalks are too narrow, the rails are way too low, cars zooming by.. it’s terrifying. I know it could be much worse, but it can also be much better. 

If a whole new bridge cannot be achieved, we need to improve the preexisting bridges. We can use steel for strong but not bulky additions, such as widening the walking space, adding a guardrail on the street side, and raising the rail on the outside. We can raise them 8+ feet high and add a roof to protect from rain and harsh sun. We can commission welding artists to make these barriers beautiful, or we can go the efficient brutalist route. The barriers can be planters. The space could be wide enough for an occasional bench. Maybe there’s even enough room for a protected bike lane! The possibilities are endless but we need to do *something* for a less car-dependent Burbank. Nothing wrong with needing a car when you need it, but encouraging walking is the best thing for our future and our children’s future. 

Had to vent somewhere so thanks for letting me do it here. These are my pre-coffee thoughts, as I dread the walk I’m about to make to the post office. I would love to draw some ideas and formally present them to the right representatives, but for now this is all I can do. Maybe someone here is reading this and has the authority to get the ball rolling.

Salary is $95k/year before taxes, live in a high COL city. About (just shy of) $4k take home a month after taxesMy wife is a freelancer so her annual income varies, but on average about $40-50k/year.

I have about $1.5k in checking account and about $3k in savings account, which is really just a vessel for my student loan payments.

My share of rent is about $1.1k, split between my wife and I. In addition to rent I pay about ~$125/month for gas. Groceries about $200/month, so all in all lets say $1500/month on general living expenses.

I also lay $100/month for a climbing gym that I use regularly.

I don’t go out much, but I probably spend anywhere from $200-400/month on myself as my wife and I like to eat out and treat ourselves. We do cook at home often and I’m usually very good about not ordering out for my lunch break. I also make coffee at home but probably spend about $25/week getting coffee (I’m addicted, but I love it).

No credit card debt, got myself out of that a few years ago. I’m using my card as much as possible and paying off immediately to rack up points, but overall making sure I stay disciplined and ensure they are zero’d out always.

I own a car but it’s paid off. Inherited from my parents.

I have about $38k in student loans left and am paying about $50/month over the minimum, and in total paying $600/month towards that. Avg of the loan interest is ~5%, and I’m doing the snowball approach and knocking out my highest ones first (have a a couple at 6.8% and the rest are are 4% and below).

I started a Roth in 2024 and have maxed it in ‘24 and ‘25, and currently have $17k in there total. Deducted straight out of my paychecks to ensure this is maxed every year. My wife is also maxing hers each year.

I have a HYSA with about $21.5k at 3.25%, was originally at 4% when I opened it. Wife also has a HYSA with a bit more in there. I add about $200/month into that.

Employee doesn’t have 401k match, which is the only reason I haven’t opened one yet.

I don’t qualify for an HSA, at least not that I’ve figured out, but might not be looking into that right. Generally though I’m rather healthy.

I also have ~$2k in robinhood, its just for fun really because stocks are just too much for me to go hard on. That amount had accumulated over the past 5 years.

No kids, and would like to own a home one day but it’s not a major priority to us either way.

My main question is regarding a 401k - I feel like opening one with Vanguard or similar and putting what I can into it is the best bet for me at the moment. Ive also considered CDs and taking it out of my HYSA (not all of it) for that, since I haven’t touched it once since opening it.

Aside from that, not sure what else to look into. Im open to anything that might be worth looking into. Im quite comfortable at the moment but want to ensure I’m being proactive in my retirement and get that to a good spot because I’m so “late” in the game on that front, but I’ve accepted that I’ll retire at 65. 

Thanks in advance! Looking to better myself financially any way I can.

- I just upgraded from my aeropress and buying a daily cortado at my local, to my own setup.  Brand new GCP,  paired with the 1Zpresso J series grinder I’ve been using for the past 5 or so years.  Plus some other bits I copped off of Amazon (shown) that I thought necessary to begin with.

Two days in, my coffee has been mediocre, as I am still figuring out the proper setting for my grinder, optimal tamping pressure, and how to extract the best temps from my machine.  Using 18 g of coffee, gunning for about 30 g of liquid, in about 30 seconds.

I think I’m doing it all right?  Set up certainly isn’t minimal but I’d also rather keep it to the bare necessities (the gear/kit nerd in me is struggling, here).

No real questions atm, just stoked to finally be able to dive deeper into the beverage I enjoy the most and figure my new setup out!!",8,1768074896.0,gaggiaclassic,1,1.0,False

1q9dsxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1q9dsxz/day_3_thoughts_hopefully_this_helps_others/,Day 3 Thoughts. Hopefully this helps others.,"First off thank you to this sub for added motivation/community & evidence of what life can be like, post Nicotine.

30M, have had the nicotine monkey on my back for the last 14ish years in various forms. At my worst, 7-8 6mg a day.

Thought I’d share some perspective from a long time users experience so far. If it helps great! Would like to give back to you all. 

Acknowledging everyone has their own process/methods that work best for them.

1. Build a strong why, search for evidence to support that why. Believe it. If you don’t have this, it’s gonna be a lot harder not to cave in times of pressure. For myself, I enjoy working out and health. I convinced myself that using zyn was to betray my authentic self. Maybe harsh, so to each their own. Evidence example: when running, I can see via my fitness watch my heart is performing much better which motivates me/reminds me when I think I want one. Meaning, heart is healthy = more aligned with who I am. 

2. Cut out accessory vices. Zyn while you game? Stop gaming. For me, it was caffeine and alcohol. I haven’t had a drink in almost a month, nor coffee in 2 weeks. Not only does this put some skin in the game, but it also gives you direct evidence that you can change habits and builds confidence that you are capable of taking on the real challenge. 

3. I did taper for about 4 months down to 3mg at 4 a day. If you can, great. Aim small miss small. 

4. Understand the brains reward function. At its essence, it’s designed for the survival of our species. Walk 10 miles to the river = hard, but you get a reward = happy + then you don’t die. Today, we are saturated with cheap, immediate dopamine hits that abuse this system. Nicotine is no different. Real reward comes from real effort. Do hard things, get rewarded for them. A lot of advice on this sub says to stay active/workout etc. This is partially why. Give your brain real rewards and it won’t look for the cheap one as much. Connect the hard things to your why and even denying the urge when it comes on for a  zyn becomes a reward/replacement in itself. Do hard stuff. 

5. Cytisine - over the counter smoking cessation aid pretty popular in Europe. Not FDA approved here (big tobacco probably had nothing to do with that) but herbal substance that attaches to the pinging dopamine receptors looking for the next hit. Do your own research, if it turns out to be a sugar pill, so be it. Can get it on Amazon. Can help you get out of the immediate trenches. 

Again again, everyone is different, but my withdrawals are honestly very very manageable. Give yourself some grace, when a craving kicks in, look at it with curiosity. “Oh, I want one now because I used to always throw in a zyn after lunch, interesting, I wonder where else I associated zyn to in my life” and move on.

For me, living my authentic life, proving to myself I am capable of what I set my mind to trumps any discomfort of the current moment. Tell the people you love that you are going to do this, and that you need their support. Let them know you might have mood swings etc and that you love them. If you need to take a sick day at work, do it and invest that time in yourself.

Good luck guys - I know I’m not even close to out of the woods yet, sharing my experience and selfishly posting this to hold myself accountable :) excited to get to know the non-nicotine me. ",3,1768074879.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

So I 19F went to dinner with my friend Jack 22M and his friend Alya 20F who just moved to our city . I’ve never met Alya, and she just moved to our city away from her and Jacks hometown so I thought it would be nice to offer her some company / friendship as I know moving to a new city is hard. The problem here is (slight TMI warning) I got my period the morning of the dinner (yesterday) and for some reason when I get it I have an extreme aversion to meat, i just can’t stomach it , it genuinely makes me gag and nauseous, as a meat lover this is very sad but it’s been a few months and I’ve learned to cope. I get to the dinner and Alya made chicken cubes and rice, she didn’t ask of any dietary restrictions to me directly (we haven’t got each others contact) and I’m assuming Jack said none, which is usually true. I didn’t mind, I just ate the rice and not the chicken. The dinner went fine, I actually thought I hit it off well with Alya we had a lot in common. The next day (this morning) I was meant to see Jack for coffee but he cancelled, saying he was busy. An hour later, he called me. He was so angry, I’ve never heard him so angry. He said that I made everyone (him and Alya) feel uncomfortable and acted like a child picking at food, he said i basically insulted her because I didn’t eat all the food. I was confused as nobody said anything at the dinner, I tried to explain my temporary meat aversion to him  and how if I knew a few days before about it I would have said something to him for the dinner. He got even more annoyed saying I had to “cope harder”  and that I need to leave Alya alone then hung up. I feel awful, if I had Alyas contact I would have texted her the day of the dinner and explained and been apologetic, but I didn’t,  I also can’t apologise to her right now. It seems like an overreaction from Jack and honestly I could see it being fixed if I explained it to her myself, but at the same time i do feel awful that I hurt her, I don’t think it’s as bad as jack is saying though, am i crazy for that or is what happened an offense?

1q9drv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Illustrious-Fly-29/comments/1q9drv4/hot_compost_doesnt_take_months_it_takes_management/,Hot compost doesn’t take months — it takes management,"Most people think compost takes months.

It doesn’t.

If you control materials, moisture, and air, you can turn scraps and yard waste into finished compost in about two weeks. No additives. No tricks. Just biology doing its job fast.

Hot composting works because microbes explode in population when conditions are right. When they’re fed properly, kept moist (not wet), and given oxygen, they generate serious heat—often 130–160°F. That heat is what speeds everything up and knocks out weed seeds and pathogens.

Cold compost is passive.  
Hot compost is managed.

# The ratio that makes it work

I treat compost like cooking. The core ratio is simple:

* **50% browns (carbon)** — dry leaves, cardboard, paper, straw
* **30% greens (nitrogen)** — food scraps, coffee grounds, grass, trimmings
* **20% water** — damp like a wrung-out sponge

Get that balance right and speed follows.

# Pile size matters

Your pile needs to be at least **3×3×3 feet**. Smaller piles bleed heat too fast and stall.

Build it all at once:

* Browns
* Greens
* Light water
* Repeat Finish with browns on top to trap heat and control odor.

If it’s built correctly, it should heat up within 1–3 days. Steam is normal. Bad smells mean lack of oxygen. Cool and dry means it needs water or greens.

# Turning is where speed comes from

I turn aggressively every 2–3 days. Each turn:

* Reintroduces oxygen
* Redistributes heat
* Prevents anaerobic pockets

A healthy pile reheats within a day after turning. That heat → turn → reheat cycle is what compresses months into weeks.

# When it’s finished

By around two weeks:

* The pile shrinks a lot
* Material is mostly unrecognizable
* Texture is dark and crumbly
* It smells like forest soil, not trash

If it doesn’t heat back up after turning, it’s done and ready to use.

# What usually slows people down

* Too many food scraps
* Not enough browns
* Letting it dry out
* Forgetting to turn
* Building too small

Hot composting isn’t hard — it’s precise.

When you control your soil, you start to control your food. And everything downstream gets better.

1q9drup,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q9drup/different_coffee_beans_grind_to_different_size/,"Different coffee beans grind to different size using same grinder settings? [KINGrinder K6, Delonghi Stilosa]","Hi everyone, relative newbie here. I have a Delonghi Stilosa and the Kingrinder K6 hand grinder (don't think it's too relevant to my problem but what the hell).

I bough some ""specialty"" Cogito coffee (2 sorts) and ground them successfuly with the hand grinder set to 35-38 ""ticks"". This achieved the coveted ""gram in, two out, in thirtyish seconds"" rule. It tasted good.

I now bought some basic storebought coffee (Hausbrandt) and tried doing the same thing I've been doing and it tasted bitter as fuck and it took over a minute to draw to desired amount. I concluded that the bitter taste was from the coffee burning because it took too long to draw because it was ground extremely fine. I also noticed immediately upon first grinding that the coffee was ground much finer, more akin to turkish coffee levels.

Since said failure I've dialed in the grinding a bit and found that \~60 clicks is more similar to the results I've been getting with the specialty coffee. 70 is already too much and it sprays everywhere. I'm guessing that I'll ultimately settle to around 55-60 clicks for this specific bean.

Now comes my question: Does anyone know why these two different coffee beans are grinding to different sizes using the same grinder with the same settings? It's not even a small difference, it's a pretty large difference of \~25 ""clicks"" on the K6. Does the kind of coffee bean really impact it this much?

I'll definitely switch back to specialty coffee since I liked it a lot but I also wanted to have a bag of ""regular"" coffee because some guests might enjoy ""normal"" coffee more.",1,1768074809.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I went through all the stages of grief-denial, anger, bargaining, depression…coming to terms now with acceptance. She’s not coming back. She chose him. She chose him several times over the course of the last few years. I lost at each interval. No contest. 

What the hell was all this? Leaving astrology and karma and past lives out of it. Leave out the rose-colored glasses and storytelling and romanticism. Leave the lens of the mind. All that’s left is pain. 

Whatever was between us was real. It was for me. I know what I felt. 

She didn’t look too happy about the energy between us. It made her look upset and sad. 

That’s not how I want someone to feel about the prospect of me.

I made a joke before about not giving up coffee and women. I take that back. Maybe it’s time. No more music either. 

I’m tired of stories and lore of past life loves and thoughts of karma and Eros/Psyche and that stupid last season of that hbo show. I’m tired of astrology. I’m tired of losing and suffering. I don’t want my mind or life dictated by outside forces any more than it has to be. 

None of this was ok. This hurt like hell. No more romanticizing pain, or problematic women. My nervous system is sensitive already. No more coffee. No more music because most of it is the ennui of love. Ick. 

I don’t believe in love. I believe we believe in fantasy. 

There’s only Maharaji. And he lives somewhere else. 

I’m 95 percent ready to let her go for good. She doesn’t want to be here. There’s no reason for me to continue with this. I don’t need to prove anything. 

Real life doesn’t have happy endings, there’s no closure, it isn’t fair. That’s where I live. It’s time to face that and let go. 

In retrospect I’m glad I was blitzed out of my mind for this phase of life. If I’d had to do it sober I would be a lot more angry and jaded than I am. The anesthetic is wearing off and I’m just tired and sad. I didn’t deserve this. 

I don’t need a relationship. I don’t need anyone. It makes life harder not easier. Look at the pain, anger and destruction it’s caused. “Love” is poison. The last thing I need is to invite someone else close to me in order to repeat this lifelong nightmare. No thanks. 

I really loved her, and I would have really loved her. Maybe that’s what I’m letting go of. Women who don’t care or respect the love and stability I’ve given them, both when they’re vulnerable and when they don’t deserve it. Women who take me for granted. Women who control me and betray my trust. Women who “love” me but won’t choose me. Women who aren’t serious or trustworthy about truly loving me. 

I would have never done this to her, or to any of them. 

I don’t have to love her. There’s no logical reason to continue this. I don’t have to love anyone. It’s not my responsibility to care. I need to make friends with indifference. 

Ok. Letting go it is. Acceptance phase. 

The truth always hurts but that’s what I’m committed to. I’m not afraid to be alone. Even in relationships the reality is I’ve always been alone. It’s finally accepting that the fantasy (and fallacy) called love has been my demise. I believed it was real. I worshipped it. I lived it with conviction. Your beliefs will make or break you, and mine broke me. ",1,1768074764.0,u_NewNeptuneSaturn,0,1.0,False

1q9dme4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9dme4,Growing crack in coffee table. Please advise,"I purchased this “Organic Modular Coffee Table” from Marketplace for a couple hundred bucks. It’s originally from West Elm. Top is solid walnut. Additionally, website says “Solid acacia wood legs covered in your choice of finish.” 

In the photos you can see a crack that has gone all the way through to the bottom. It extends about half way into the narrowest side. I want to be able to repair this before it gets worse, as I would hate to lose this table. 

My initial thoughts are to sand it all down, fill the crack with wood epoxy filler, clamp, sand, and try to find a similar dark walnut. 

Are these the correct steps? Any good resources I can check out? Should I put in a few staples underside for good measure once all is said and done?

I had a Cosori stainless steel electric kettle, and the small heating element inside the kettle at the bottom (the little metal nub that presumably heats up) tested very positive for lead.

*Side note to be clear - I am 100% confident in the test result. I have a piece of lead in my garage I used as a control, and tested all sorts of things in my kitchen. Our stainless steel pots and multiple Le Creuset / Lenox cookware and mugs all came back 100% negative. Our water is also negative - we have a whole house filter and I did 2 different water tests, both negative.*

Before the Cosori, I had a Balmuda electric kettle which I loved but the thin shiny metal coating at the bottom started flaking off, revealing a more dull metal underneath. I was probably drinking those tiny flakes of the metal coating for weeks.

I am starting to doubt that I can even find a lead-free electric kettle, as it seems like the heating element that is inside the kettle to heat the water via electricity is almost certainly going to contain lead. The Cosori kettle is on every ""best lead-free / non-toxic"" electric kettle list I can find, so I am at a loss. Willing to spring for Fellow or Great Jones or something, but I am curious if anyone has experience with this. Thank you!

PS - I have to believe a 100% stainless steel kettle that I have to heat on the stove is probably my safest bet, since I think I can isolate the lead to the heating element of an electric kettle. But I figure it's worth asking if there are any options out there.",1,1768074123.0,tea,3,1.0,False

Ever feel like your savings are just… sitting there? Like a forgotten gym membership, collecting dust instead of gains? What if I told you that *right now*, your money could be working harder than you are?

Here’s the thing: **Most people underestimate their financial potential.** They see their savings as a static number—$10K, $50K, $100K—and think, *""That’s nice, but it’s not life-changing.""* Wrong. With the right moves, that number could be the seed of something *way* bigger.

### **How Your Savings Could Actually Fund Your Future**
1. **The Power of Compound Interest** – Einstein called it the 8th wonder of the world. Even small, consistent investments can snowball into serious wealth over time. Example: $500/month at 7% return = **$500K+ in 30 years.** Not bad for coffee money.
2. **Passive Income Streams** – Your savings aren’t just for emergencies. They’re your ticket to freedom. Dividend stocks, rental income, or even a side hustle can turn idle cash into a money-making machine.
3. **The ""I Didn’t Know I Could Do That"" Factor** – Most people don’t realize how accessible smart investing is. You don’t need a finance degree—just the right tools and a little guidance.

**Here’s the kicker:** You might already have enough to start. That ""not enough"" feeling? It’s just fear talking.

I'm still haunted by the memory of being 14, writing stories down during class. On the day that I tried to write my very first kissing scene, my math teacher caught me not paying attention and decided to confiscate my notepad. I was mortified when she didn't give it back to me after class; she actually took it home and gave it back to me the next day. I was desperately hoping that she only wanted to teach me a lesson without actually looking at what I'd done. ""You're writing a story?"" is what she said when she handed it back to me, and I could only nod as I wished for the ground to open up and swallow me whole. I was SO embarrassed that I never tried to write anything remotely romantic for years, because my inner cringe-meter went through the roof. I just couldn't shake the memory. That same year was the first and only time I ever tried to write fanfics.

13 years later, last month, around Christmas, I finally found the courage to start a new fanfic with fluffy romance. I posted the first two chapters, reassuring myself that maybe it wouldn't gain any attention, so I wouldn't have to feel weird about it. But against my predictions, people read it, liked it, and commented on it. It was an amazing experience.

Back then, when I was trying to find an idea, a plot bunny was hopping around in my brain, but it required a character writing love poems, something that I'd never tried before and had no clue how to do. So I didn't and picked something else.

Now, for some reason, I always find it the easiest to write while on a train since I have nothing better to do anyway, and my inner critic disappears for a while. A few days ago, I was sitting at the train station thanks to the train being delayed (in a country famous for delayed trains), and while I was in the waiting hall, I saw that someone had carved a love confession into one of the benches. And my brain decided that THIS is what I could use as inspiration for trying to write my first poem, my first love poem, and so I started to write something and actually managed to create an entire poem. I showed it to friends despite being a bit embarrassed, and they told me it's good!

But I was facing another problem then - my plot revolves around B finding the first poem and publishing it, hoping to find the author, and A being so embarrassed that he decides to write a poem so embarrassing to readers that B wouldn't try to do it again. The first thought that went through my brain was to copy pop music, the way that songs clearly revolve around sex. I discussed it with a friend and said that I can't just do that, write something bordering on erotic, and she asked me, Why not?

I didn't have a better idea, and I was lacking inspiration for that one, so when I had to take a train the next time, I was hoping to encounter something once again. It was delayed, again, and in shitty weather, again, but nothing stood out to me. Until, at one particular stop, I looked out the window and saw a flat bread, still wrapped in its plastic packaging and lying on the track bed, and I asked the universe if this is really the best thing it could send me.

A whole day later, I'm sitting here and, with the power of coffee and cheesecake, decided to test if I can actually write a somewhat erotic sounding poem inspired by that flat bread. It's still a draft, but I DID IT! 

It's actually genuine, and you wouldn't connect it to my inspiration without knowing about it, but I tried to use as many parts as I could, for example, ""to make your mouth water at the sight of me"". I showed the draft to my friend, asking if it's too terrible, and she told me that she's confused by the thought of how sexy flatbread can look on the train tracks, and that it's good. 

I can't believe I pulled it off or that I would have so much fun trying this, seeing if I could do it. I'm way too proud of myself to feel embarrassed! So hey, if you're looking for inspiration, maybe try this unconventional method and see where it gets you.",6,1768073265.0,AO3,0,0.8,False

It has really been growing a lot the past year and I attend a lot of the events, which tend to be about self growth, light spiritualism, etc. 

The only issue is, inevitably, when it’s a group of women, it starts to devolve into talk about kids and birth and their identity “as a mom.” I am starting to get frustrated and pulling away because it dominates the conversation and they don’t seem able to discuss world events, self improvement, or career unless it’s somehow related to their kids. I get that kids are a big part of their lives but it’s so isolating as someone without kids. There are a couple of other childfree and unmarried people in the group and I’d imagine it’s tough for them too. 

I went to another workshop today and it’s supposed to be a series but I’m wondering if I want to let them know I won’t be coming to the other two sessions. It was supposed to be about unlearning unhelpful beliefs and trying to reach your own life goals but without fail it was all “I want to be the best mom I can“ (nothing about actual personal goals) and then as usual it started getting into birth stories, gory pregnancy shit, etc and then the person running the group started talking about how she’s trying for a baby and can’t wait to be a mom, etc. I just felt like I couldn’t relate at all and was like, do any of you have personal goals or identities outside of motherhood? Like why am I even here?

I’m writing because I’m really struggling and hoping that someone might relate or at least offer some advice.

For over a year now, I’ve been dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. In those moments, I am completely convinced that something terrible is happening to me — that it’s something serious — and the fear just keeps feeding itself in a vicious cycle. Every time I think I’m having a stroke or a heart attack “for sure,” and then once I calm down, I realize it was just a panic attack and anxiety.

My first panic attack happened at the end of November last year. I went out with a friend, and suddenly it hit me — intense panic, fear, and a feeling of losing control. We went to the ER; they did an ECG, checked my blood pressure and labs — everything was normal. The doctor said it was obvious I was very anxious and offered medication to calm me down, but I’ve never really been someone who likes taking meds.

When I got home, that’s when the real panic attack started: disorganized speech, irrational fears, constantly asking my parents if I was going to die, if it was my heart, a stroke, etc.

After that, I experienced depersonalization and went to the doctor again — blood tests, urine tests — all normal. The third time, I even did an ultrasound of my heart and abdomen — again, everything was perfect.

For the next 7–8 months, I had constant anxiety, especially after alcohol or going out. I started connecting every physical sensation to some serious illness:

* Pain in my calf → I think it’s a blood clot
* Pain near my lungs → I get chest scan, everything is fine
* Twitching sensations in my chest → scan again, all fine
* A sensation in the upper right side of my abdomen → I think my liver is failing (which is what I’ve been feeling these days)

I became extremely sensitive to sounds and light during certain periods. Whenever I hear that someone has died, anxiety completely overwhelms me. Even small things — drinking coffee or eating certain foods — immediately make me think they will harm me.

I may have had a somewhat unhealthy lifestyle when it comes to alcohol over the past few years, but I honestly think it was within what’s considered “normal.” I sleep well and eat well, and I don’t believe I could have damaged myself that badly.

I’ve read about psychosomatics and Freud’s idea that repressed conflicts can “spill over” into the body — that symptoms aren’t a malfunction, but rather the body’s attempt to stabilize itself.

When I talk about all of this, I actually calm down and feel more normal, which makes me think this might really be anxiety-based and that there’s some underlying trigger causing it.

Yesterday I heard a story from a friend about a character in a series who, after witnessing someone’s finger being cut off in childhood, started having panic reactions whenever he saw meat. How much do you think this could be connected to some kind of “minor” trauma that I might be able to uncover — maybe only with the help of a psychotherapist?

My questions for you:

* Has anyone been through something similar?
* Can this leave long-term consequences on the psyche or the body?
* How did you break out of this vicious cycle of fear and physical symptoms?
* What are your experiences with psychotherapy?

Any advice, shared experience, or words of support would mean a lot to me.

1q9cydb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1q9cydb/valiant_lady_review_aruban_nights_and_antiguan/,Valiant Lady Review Aruban nights and Antiguan Sights,"We just finished our 6 night / 7 day voyage with Virgin. We had a couple of ports redirected due to the Venezuela problem the night before our boarding. Virgin handled everything wonderfully and we had a great sailing. 

As this is our fourth cruise in 5 years and everyone keeps discussing how “things have changed” I thought I’d share my two cents.

1) Has the crowd changed / become more conservative  - Yes and No. The demographics are a lot more varied and there is a wider variety of people on the ship. When we first sailed there was definitely a younger crowd and vibe. But those looking to be wild and sexy, young and young at heart have plenty of others  around with the same attitude. And those who aren’t certainly seem at least amused / supportive of those who are more “free spirited” 

\- another note on conservatism - there were definitely a few old dudes with MAGA tees and gun iconography on them but they were a very small minority and seemed relegated to the casino. 

2) Is the vibe less “sexy” in the way of shows, happenings cast etc - yes but it’s minor. The Happenings cast is less sexual in their demeanor than in the past and their outfits have become a bit more conservative over time. The shows still have a lot of innuendo and crass humor. There is still a lot for LGBTQ+ people to appreciate. The Misbehave Show was dirty good fun as was Bingo. The VHS workout class was crazy dirty years ago and even I was blushing. This has changed. 

3) Has service gone downhill - this I will say sadly yes. Not hugely but enough it was noticeable. Our room cleaning was meh. In the past they have folded and organized everything. Now they do the bare minimum and even at that they forgot to replenish the water bottles and a couple of other noticeable details. The galley for service at the tables is kind of a mess. The staff speaks very little English and does not know the menu very well. They are also very hard to get help from and forget orders etc - leave you sitting there. I like to relax in the morning by the window with my coffee and order rather than run around with the tray. This was disappointing. 

4) Restaurants - Extra Virgin is still number one for me. Amazing food and great service. Pink agave was really good again. Both venues had a couple new items in the menu but could use an over haul of the menu for some more refreshing. Razzle Dazzle is what it is. I hear there’s a new concept on the way. The Test Kitchen has added a new menu as well for those that have done menus A and B. Gunbae is fun only with the right people. I’ve had better Korean BBQ.  I did not do The Wake this time. Service at all restaurants was great. 

Club venues: first night at the manor was great. Classic Manor playing lots of fun music. The music at Scarlet Night party is awful and chaotic with an insistence on only playing 7 seconds of any given song. My favorite night is typically the final night at the manor which sort of goes through dance hits from the 70’s until now. But this time it was “Caliente” night. Latin music. I’d hoped it would be Latin music for maybe the first 45 minutes but that seemed not to be the case. It was fun for an hour but the dance floor was pretty sparse as I think not enough sailors wanted to merengue all night long. This was disappointing as I love dancing with all the people I’ve met and saying goodbye. 

Something I LOVED: they added a nightly LGBTQ+ meet up each night at 5:30. Only the G’s showed up but it was great. (I did connect with a great group of L’s in the pool on a couple of occasions. Super fun) Such a wide variety of guys from all over! A variety of ages and backgrounds. And everyone was so kind and fun. We really connected and planned excursions, beach trips and pool time together. This was such a bonus and very special. 

Ports / Excursions: we did a stop in Barbados. Lesson learned. Go to the beach or stay in the boat. Bridgetown is a dump. St Lucia is gorgeous and watch out for the rum punch on those catamarans! The natural shoreline in Phillipsburg is amazing but strenuous! Wear hiking shoes!! The beach at St John was lovely. 

All in all a fantastic voyage. As always we met so many wonderful people, ate and drank way too much, danced like fools, laughed too hard and too long and even found some time for rest! 

I hope Virgin continues to strive for improvement in some areas. As far as things getting “tame” - yes but hardly. Let’s just hope is stays where it is in regard to that. Do I have my quibbles? Sure. Will we sail again? You better believe it! ",5,1768072920.0,VirginVoyages,0,0.86,False

This is f x m but! I am a female. Idm what gender you are but my oc will be male whilst your oc is a female for this!





Hi! I'm looking for rp partners!  I am a 22 meaning I am looking for people 18+ I am would actually prefer 20 plus to be honest. I am a female in real life (just incase my gender matters to you.) 

I have been roleplaying for 8-9 years. Possibly longer, hard to pinpoint exactly when I started. But I do have experience. However, I do usually stay semi lit as I find that is the perfect range for rp to be smooth, not to over done and also so characters can interact with each other. So I do 4+lines occasionally less. Occasionally more. 

I do put a password in to my posts sooo- spot the password lol. 

My limits are simple, don't ghost me please, if you need a break, let me know, nothing gross in the rp! No armpits, no scat or anything like that. Just no. I mainly do romances, I don't do aton of drama as too much is just exhausting but I do mix my romances with different things like supernatural, fantasy and so on and so forth. 

Plot of the day! 

My oc is male, yours is female. That is the pairing for this rp. M x F. I really really wanna do a stereotypical kinda plot. My oc is the bad boy. Comes from a...well, difficult home life. While your oc comes from the perfect family. He does stupid things almost every night whilst she studies, chats with friends and stays at home or anywhere that isn't a bar, party, club, she's sweet, friendly. She's an angel. Everyone loves her. She's innocent. He's the opposite. 

They run into each other in the hall of college, a college she adores and one he's honestly surprised he got into. 

That's how it begins! 


The password is: lover..love her. 

I hope you enjoyed the read even if you decided the plot wasn't for you. Here's some tea/coffee as thanks for reading! ☕🍵🧋

1q9clt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAQDebate/comments/1q9clt3/two_days_of_argument_flooding/,Two Days of Argument Flooding,"For two days, this sub was flooded by almost 200 paragraphs of commentary from u/Richard_Wharfinger. When I asked him, for the sake of sustainable dialogue and sub moderation, to limit his commentary to one response, per thread, per day, with four paragraphs, he was not pleased. Richard demands “documentary evidence” from Oxfordians (fine), but he repeatedly *leaves the record* when it suits the Stratfordian narrative. Examples: he says “it seems reasonable” Heminges/Condell “knew the man” they praised and treats that as effectively dispositive—yet that’s an inference about private knowledge, not a document. He asserts the Folio “Friend & Fellow” “can only apply” to Stratford and that honorific “gent.” uniquely identifies him—again, plausible, but it’s still an interpretive step that assumes there’s no other path (e.g., deliberate allonymity). He also keeps invoking “the evidence shows” Stratford birth and says it’s “reasonable to assume” John Shakespeare raised his family in the Henley Street property—explicitly conceding he can’t prove it, but treating the assumption as default because it’s convenient.

He also characterizes Stratfordian suppositions as if they’re neutral “common sense.” He frames the entire attribution dossier as straightforward authorship proof (“literally every single piece…identifies Shakespeare”), then dismisses alternative explanations as “squint and decoder ring” speculation—without actually *demonstrating* that pseudonymity/allonymity is impossible in principle. He claims “everything we do know points to Stratford” while simultaneously admitting how thin or secondhand many early modern biographical claims are for other writers; that move functions rhetorically as “therefore Stratford must be true,” which is not the same as “therefore alternative models are false.” And he repeatedly shifts the burden: any question about how prefatory matter works or what paratext can bear is labeled “speculative nonsense,” even when he himself leans on inference about motives, knowledge, and identity-linking.

A more serious problem is that he’s frequently mocking or openly contemptuous. He uses loaded labels like “anti-Shakespeareans,” “anti-Shakespeare crowd,” “Shakespeare authorship denier,” and “conspiracy theory” as if those settle the argument rather than describe it from his own subjective view. I have yet to meet an Oxfordian who hates Shakespeare, and speaking for myself, my research comes from a great love for the works stretching over three decades. He calls an interlocutor’s points “wittering on like background music,” says “nothing you say is to be taken seriously,” describes Oxfordian interpretations as “hallucinated monkey faces,” and says the late Alexander Waugh “should have been sectioned,” which, for our non-British readers, means involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. Richard characterizes opposing views as “uninformed and unsupported fancies.” He also drops “to put it in crude terms, we know precisely fuck-all,” and calls ideas “speculative nonsense,” which isn’t critique—it’s attempted intimidation dressed as certainty.

None of this means the Stratford case is wrong; it means Richard isn’t applying his stated standard consistently. He rightly demands Oxfordians distinguish record from inference, but then relies on his own inferences (about knowledge, identity linkage, “only possible” referents, and “reasonable assumptions”) while calling the other side “deniers” and “conspiracy theorists.” **Linking those who question the traditional narrative to those who question the Holocaust is a very low standard of debate,** and violates the rule requiring respectul discourse. Please call me out if you find I ever resort to that same low standard here. If we’re serious about method, we should all separate: (a) what documents *say*, (b) what they *imply*, and (c) what we *assume* to make a narrative feel closed. I invite Richard to continue the discussion, as he is evidently a very intelligent person with plenty of background knowledge.

I got some new coworkers at this new job and got back into contact with some old friends that work for the same company I dont know how to word that. But again baseline friendships and relationships. Except one person. I do not understand her. We agreed to be plutonic and be friends but I don’t know. I got her coffee one day plutonically I swear she called it a date but wouldn’t say it loud enough to hear it and when I asked she said “nevermind Im just messing with you”. This is the same woman who asked me why I spent 5.2k in a pay period and when I said my ex pissed me off she seemed put off by that. I told her someone said he’s going out with her and she like over explained to me that they weren’t. I told her when I first got her number I thought she was cute and and I want to hang out or something I dunno and she said there’s nothing we can really do together when I pushed away and apologized for making things weird she changed her mind and suddenly there was stuff we could do. I didn’t respond once for 5 hours cus my phone died and she asked me if I was okay. She’ll give me compliments which I don’t remember receiving compliments in years and I swear it almost made me cry.

But again Ive been friendzoned she said she doesn’t think a relationship will work and she’s talking to a guy. 

What bothers me is if I push away she doesn’t let me (so far atleast), if I don’t respond she’ll ask if Im okay apparently, and she gives compliments but we’re plutonic and just friends. So either there’s a perfectly logical explanation for this behavior or for the past 3 years Ive been friends with the shittiest friends on this earth.",1,1768072060.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Hi, all,

60M, US-based poster. Long time lurker; occasional poster. 

I am in search of a new roasting method that will allow me to roast 1/2 to 1 lb of beans once a week in the most efficient / quickest amount of time. 

I'm no longer as passionate about roasting as I once was and now am looking to only get it done quickly and easily. 

I go through about 1 to 1 1/2 lbs a week between beans for espresso brew and beans for pourover. 

Been researching roasters and am kind of landing on a gas grill method (again).

I know RK suggests minimum 40k BTU but AI-google suggests 5000BTUs for every pound. This would significantly lower the cost of the new grill. for me if I only wanna roast 1 lb.  

My budget is around $500US.

What, IYOs, would I need to roast 1 lb once a week on a gas grill? 

**Give me thoughts on the grill, the rotisserie and the basket for roasting 1 lb - budget $500US**

Thank you!



*PS- For context, if you're interested...*

*I've been home roasting off-and-on for nearly 3 decades.* 

*I started off with cast iron / spoon and moved to stovetop whirleypop before moving to a Swissmar AlpenRost (some of you who've been in the game a long time may remember the Swissmar).* 

*I was buying beans from Tom at SM when he was still  in Columbus, OH. lol*

*The Alp was riddled with problems so I moved on quickly (\~2y) to a gas grill method, using what I had on hand: existing gas grill, basket from the Alp and my variable-speed drill (lol...ikr?).* 

*That worked...okay... but ultimately fizzled out because my gas grill was old and took the old style tank that was unsafe.* 

*Regardless, by this time, Third Wave coffee shops/roasters and fresh-roasted beans were finding their way into my community store and grocery stores of my metro area.* 

*So I resolved to just purchasing fresh-roasted beans (I still purchase from a local roaster frequently to support my local small businesses).* 

*Alas, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I am not thrilled with this shift to light-to-medium roast only on all coffees to preserve the nuances/terroir of the bean.* 

*Yes, I completely agree that light-to-medium roasts has its merits for some beans.*

*But IMVHO, so does a deep roast at 30 sec beyond 2nd crack or even a shade darker.* 

*And it is REALLY hard to find this anymore with fresh-roasts! And when I ask, I'm looked at like I'm a Riunite drinker in a wine shop asking about lambrusco. lol!*

*Again, IMVHO, there is something to be said to roast 3 different beans from 3 different terroirs/regions to 3 different roast profiles and blend post-roast. The Melange...SM calls it. Chef's kiss IMO.*

*Also, the price of fresh-roasted coffee (coffee in general) has, as many of you know, skyrocketed.*

*So a couple of years ago, my sis gifted me a hot air popcorn popper.* 

*I decided to start roasting again and things are going...okay.* 

*The roasts are coming out great.* 

*But the hot air popcorn roaster can only handle \~2 oz (wt) pre-roast for each roast and that yields about 1.8 oz post roast. So it's taking me FOREVER to roast enough to last me a week.*

*And I have to do this once a week. Ugh.*

*So I began researching roasters. Roasters in my orbit and budget were the FR SR800, Behmor and Skywalker.* 

*And while all 3 (I believe) market that they can roast \~1/2 lb, I am skeptical based on what I read here from owners and my experience with the AlpenRost* 

*I'm convinced that roasting at max capacity regularly takes its toll on the roaster...quickly.*

*So, I'm also now considering the gas grill method again. I have the space in my heated garage and could keep everything set up and ready to go - easy-peasy, I think.*

*RK now seems focused on commercial roasting. I don't need a grill or basket for 12 lbs.*

*So looking to put together my own setup. Hence my questions above.* 

*Thanks for reading if you got this far. :)*",1,1768071826.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Price wise it sits in that budget-to-mid lane, about what you’d pay for a basic Toshiba or similar compact microwave, not the fancy inverter stuff.

Heating performance is decent but not what I’d call punchy for a claimed 1000 watts. A bowl of soup and a mug of coffee got hot, just slower than another 1000W unit I’ve worked on, so cook times needed a bit of recalibration. Ten power levels help if you actually use them, and they made melting stuff less of a gamble.

Size and capacity at 1.1 cu ft is that sweet spot for most plates, meal prep containers, and a medium casserole. Countertop footprint is noticeable though, so I measured before sliding it under my cabinet. Installation and setup were simple: plug in, set clock, done, no weird smell. Aesthetics and finish are a sleek black, hides smudges ok, not a design statement but it looks fine.

Ease of use is strong. Control panel design is basic and readable, plus one-touch presets like 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes are the buttons I hit all day. Reheat efficiency for leftovers was good, and cooking evenness surprised me in a good way, the turntable rotation helped keep hot spots down.

Noise level is mixed. Some folks call it quiet, and on light loads it is, but with heavier stuff the turntable stability can get wobbly and loud. A full soup bowl made the glass tray rattle on the roller ring, annoying at night. Door mechanism is a pull-open style rather than the push latch, which I prefer, but the door can still sound clunky if you aren’t gentle.

Defrost function works, nothing special, decent for ground meat. Child lock function exists and it’s easy enough to toggle off, yet it can be a pain if you never need it.

Build quality feels ok for the money, but dents in shipping seem common, and I’d inspect the cabinet panels. One user reported scary exterior heat buildup and poor venting on longer cook runs, so I watched for that and yeah, after 3-4 minutes it got warmer than I like on the outside. That part has me cautious on safety first, airflow space around it matters, and I wouldnt wedge it tight in a corner. Energy efficiency is basically “standard microwave,” fast heat beats an oven, but it’s not an inverter saver either.",1,1768071822.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

I am looking to buy my first espresso machine and I would really appreciate some advice. I am based in Europe, Romania to be exact, and right now I can get the Breville Barista Sense / Sunbeam Origins sense for around 350 USD, down from roughly 800 USD due to a 50% discount. Because of this deal, it suddenly looks very tempting.

Initially, I was planning to buy a DeLonghi Dedica and spend more of the budget on a good grinder, since I know how important the grinder is for espresso. After seeing this discount, I started reconsidering.

I am new to making espresso at home. My main goal is to achieve good crema, sweet espresso, and those nice pour shots you often see online. I enjoy experimenting and learning, but I do not want something that is extremely frustrating to work with.

If I go with the Barista Sense, I plan to buy a bottomless portafilter, a puck screen, and possibly a better grinder if the built in one is not good (I saw some review online testing, and it was actually pretty good).

My questions are the following. Is the Breville Barista Sense a good choice for a beginner at this price? Is the built in grinder good enough, or would an external grinder still make a noticeable difference? Can this machine realistically produce espresso close to specialty caffe quality, or is that unrealistic? Would the Dedica paired with a good grinder still be a smarter long term choice?

I do not want to make the most perfect shot and I have other expensive hobbies. I really just want a good tasting coffee that is close to a specialty caffe and to look nice, have a good crema.

I really enjoy good crema and sweet coffee, and I am happy to practice and improve over time. I just want to make sure I am not buying something that will limit me too quickly.

I have lived all my life in italy and i was born here etc ill spare all the useless informations, when i was 18 i met this guy online, he used to study in the same city i live in even if he's from the middle east he wasn't happy of his situation and all so when we talked for a month and then ghosted each others i didn't think much about it. Fast forward 2 years later we texted again cuz i randomly reached out after seeing he posted on stories on i guess, just to check up on him nothing much no other motive. I kinda wish i never did that cuz i regret it till this day. We texted the whole day and for the next 3 days we texted and called 24/7, he said he's coming back so i shoot my shot and said to grab coffee. He booked a flight that day for two days after just cuz he wanted to see me that badly. Picked him up from the train station, since the beginning i felt there was smth about this but i just brushed it off, cuz its weird i didn't know this guy much so why am i feeling those feelings anyway. We hugged as if i was a woman hugging her husband after he came back from deployment. Since the moment i saw him at the train station i swear we were inseparable, Everyday we saw each others, we had breakfast everyday together and he would come pick me up everyday from work, on my rest days we would go on dates, he was just amazing i felt safe and all i told him everything about me and he did the same and we just clicked. He asked me out after a month and i was the happiest girl alive ngl, I'm literally crying while I'm writing this lol, we kept doing kept that routine for 4 more months.

He needed to go back to his country to fix somethings with his parents, i was scared he would go and never come back he pinky promised he would be back by December 2023. He never did season passed we kept having calls and FaceTime dates. I fought with my mom when she found out and told me i should do all of this and I'm betraying her and my father, i felt extremely guilty but after being mad for a week or two she let go of the topic cuz she knows how in bad shape i was with depression for almost the last decade so she never brought it up she trusted me and she knew i wasn't fooling around. Told him everything obv and he promised to come talk to my parents when he could. His situation got worse in summer 2025 got kicked out etc so he didn't know when he could come back, i did my best to make it easier for him. But obviously i could do much since i was at least 2500 kms away, in the end he broke up with me because of his situation, i don't blame him never will. All i do is blame myself for falling that hard and trusting someone that much just for them to abandon me like that. And till this day i reminisce all the memories i have with him, i wished him the best the day we broke up didn't shed a tear... i just let go cuz i thought that was the best thing i could do for myself after waiting for more than one year. After two weeks i was out, just finished working i was in a really bad shape i just called my best friend and told her to come pick me up cuz i was feeling sick, and it just hit me right then and there in her passenger seat, i cried for hours while all her comforting words were in vain. I was in a bad shape the only thing that kept me from crumbling was my job that i did not want to lose so i worked 5 days a week and then on weekends i would stay curled up on my bed crying. Went on for a months tried to go out with guys but didn't work out i would just think they will abandon me like he did and that i will never experience love as pure as what i had with him. Thank god i never reached out to him even when i wanted it so badly, but after having winter vacation and staying home all day everyday it just hit me again and I'm finding it really difficult to get out of bed.

I lost a lot of weight since the break up, my hair is falling and my mom is starting to notice, i don't even think i can explain in any language how i feel to her rn i would just cry.

Im really sorry if this is long, i just poured my heart after months.

**Disclosure:** This is my channel; not sponsored. Mods please let me know if this post isn’t OK and I’ll remove.

**What I found (TL;DW):**

* Each book = 32 cards from a 100-card set
* Consistent **red cracked ice** \+ **red holo** per book
* Chases: **autographs**, **numbered**, **Color Blast** (I didn’t hit those this time)
* Photography/print quality is surprisingly nice; book is a legit coffee-table piece

* Be a subscriber, like the video, and comment on the video

**Questions for the sub:**

* If you’ve opened these, have you seen **numbered or color blast** show up?
* Is $59.99 fair for the bundle (book + 32 cards), or should Panini drop MSRP?

On arriving to London, many people (at least 4) with golf bags didn’t receive them - including me. There was no oversized luggage delivered at all. 

I filled out all the forms for tracking and was told I would get it next day. After not receiving for a few days, I called. I got the “someone is looking for it, don’t worry” response. I told them I have an Apple AirTag in the bag and know exactly where it is and if they wanted that info. They said “no, someone is looking for it.” I said I know where it is with 5-10 meters and was once again brushed off. 

Now it’s 5 days later and the bag is still there. It hasn’t moved. Clearly no one is “looking for it”. If I was there and had access, I could literally find it within 5 minutes. I am willing to share the AirTag location with someone, but BA isn’t interested.

He would be online a lot but not reply to me and it got to the point where he didn’t answer me for 2 days, we used to text every day. I texted him and asked if everything was okay because his dog had just died and I wanted to understand why he was doing this. He said he was overwhelmed with work and that he was withdrawing due to overwhelm but that he would improve his replied. 2 days later, the ignoring just got worse so we had this convo:

me: “[his name], I’m not going to lie I’ve been really upset these past 2 days and I have been in tears this morning. I know that you’re overwhelmed at the moment with work, ginger, etc but sometimes I feel like you don’t care about me and it really hurts. I think it’s important to let you know how I’m feeling right now, that’s all. I know it’s hard for some people but I just want to know how you feel because it feels like I’m being left in the dark and I do care about you a lot and I am here for you ❤️”

him: “[my name], I’m sorry you’re right, but I don’t think I can continue this relationship any further I’m not in the right headspace to do it, I’m really sorry, it has nothing to do wuth you you’re one of the nicest people I’ve ever met I just don’t think I csn be the person that you deserve right now, I’m so sorry, I don’t want to lose contact with you I would love to keep talking I just don’t think I can continue in a relationship.”

“I stull want to be friends and in future if you are still interested in being in a relationship I would be too, I just really don’t think I am right now I just can’t, it’s nithing to do with you, I wouldblove to still talk to you as friends.”

He was always incredibly anxious around me and he would apologise for absolutely everything when he really didn’t have to. But I am so angry at him.

EDIT: He broke up with me on the day of a concert I had been looking forward to all year. I went along with the idea of being friends and he took me out for breakfast 2 weeks after the break up, then when I asked him a week later if we wanted to meet for coffee, he replied AN ENTIRE DAY later saying that he would love to but when it came to the day of it, he never showed up or messaged to say he couldn’t make it.

The shame of starting over at 32 is killing me.,"I was supposed to meet up with a woman today. She’s great and honestly she’s interested in me. But as the time got closer I realized I didn't even have a spare 20,000 Tsh to buy us a simple round of coffee. Instead of being honest I did what I always do... I acted like I wasn't interested and I ghosted.

A few years ago this wouldn't have been a thought. I had the car,a job and a high salary. I was the guy who handled everything. But I blew it. Bad spending, alcohol, and weed took it all. Now I’m back in my parents' house trying to rebuild a business from scratch but the mental weight is heavy.

The hardest part apart from being  broke is the hiding. Deep down I want the connection. I want to be with someone. But I feel like I have absolutely nothing to offer a partner right now. I feel like a fraud. When a woman shows interest I instinctively run away because I can’t face the  ""Where do you live?"" questions.

The shame of being 32 and having to choose between a date and basic survival is a pain I wouldn't wish on anyone. I act cold and uninterested to protect my pride but the truth is I’m just broken and embarrassed.

Do not get me wrong, I have a lovely husband and a couple of pets and nice colleagues and a family that does not try to push me to get pregnant (anymore, it got better the older I became). But I recently realized that I do not really have one friend left. When the first friend became pregnant I tried to be supportive, even though I find babies and kids plain boring and a pain to be around. I helped with shopping for baby, I listened to endless laments about pregnancy, when baby was finally born I tried to be interested in it and so on. But I myself somehow just vanished in that friendship. They were not interested in me and my life anymore and constantly so self-centered and baby-fixated, it was unbelievable. That friendship just wasted away until it finally died. And it has been like that with every other friend that became pregnant ever since. It got easier for me mentally when I started to write them off once they announced pregnancy as I knew what was coming. The most horrible experience was with my former best friend, she did not just became a mother, it was more as if the person I befriended with just vanished and was then replaced with a total mombie. She lost all her interests (it was not the most intellectual of all friendships but we regularly travelled together and were both very into make-up and fashion) and became nothing more than a baby-nurturing-machine with no personality or interests. Now I have no more friends. I do not make friends easily and I fear to be friendless forever now. Meanwhile, my husband still has his friends, even when they became fathers, maybe there is no such thing as a „dadbie“. They still meet up and talk normal talks that do not include the baby bullshit.

*One*

 

Its 6:30pm on a Tuesday.

I’m relaxing on the futon, in my boxers, reading Raymond Chandler’s *The Big* Sleep.  The TV is humming softly in the background and my stomach’s full with spaghetti. I use Prego. Fuck Ragu.

Can’t say things have been too eventful lately. A Jew named Carly came home with me a little over a week ago, but shortly after we’d started doing the deed we changed our minds and just watched cable.

Re-runs of Home Improvement.

Anyway, I’m reading my book and enjoying the quiet. I get a lot of it and wouldn’t have it any other way.

As I’m turning the page, I hear a hum rising. Then: a loud popping. Like popcorn.

Out of the corner of my eye: a spark.

It’s not the TV. 

The lights start flickering.

Thinking the power’s about to go out, I look at the window. Calm weather.

Then another spark. Now I put the book down.

There’s a god damn thunderstorm on my ceiling.

It’s a little difficult to properly document this experience in text, so bear with me here. There’s lightning and clouds hovering on my ceiling, the lights are flickering, and now the TV’s skipping like an old VHS would. And all I can think is: cigarette. 

I grab my pack and quickly light up, never taking my eyes off the ceiling.

Now there’s a white dot at the center of the storm and it’s getting larger. It goes from the size of a peanut to a six foot oval in a matter of seconds...

And then...

SMASH.

A blonde falls out of the storm and crashes through my coffee table. Now I’m thinking Terminator. I take a ridiculously long drag from my cigarette and just sit there. Unsure.

She’s wearing tight leather pants and a wife beater. Not bad looking at all. But she’s not moving. Went right through the damn table.

Still sitting on the futon, I give her a gentle nudge with my foot.

She winces.

“Hey lady, you alright?”

She’s starting to stir.

I don’t think any porno ever started like this.

“Lady?  You alright?”

No answer.  So I give her another push with my foot. A little harder this time.

And quicker than I could say ‘Maury Povich’ she spins around on her knees and has a 9mm pointed square at my forehead.

“Whoa!  No need for the heavy artillery, chick!” She looks determined. Her eyes are locked dead on me. Nice eyes. Eyebrows could use a little plucking.

At last she speaks, “Are you Quincy Moore?”

I look at her baffled...Not sure how to reply. I am in fact Quincy Moore, but I don’t know this chick’s agenda.

So I reply, being the wiseass that I am, “Who’s asking?”

“I’m Sasha Livingston. I’ve come back in time from the year 2049 and I’m looking for Quincy Moore. “Now”, she cocks the gun, “are you or are you *not* Quincy Moore?”

Okay, now I’m pretty sure there was a porno that started like this. I take a drag and quickly weigh my options.

“Alright, you found me.  I’m Quincy?”

“Good.”

She puts the gun down and, getting to her feet, brushes off the glass and wood splinters.

“Wait a second. You’re just gonna take my word for it?”

“You have to come with me right now. We’ve got less than eight hours left.”

“Well now, hold on a minute.” I stub the butt in the ashtray. “I’ve got no problem going anywhere with a pretty lady like you, but we’ve actually got less than two hours. You see, *LOST* starts at nine and-”

“Two hours? Impossible. The target’s location is still unconfirmed.”

I sit back on the futon and cross my legs. No hurry. 

“Sorry hun, but I don’t miss *LOST* for anything. A week ago, my buddy Paul was drunk off his ass at the bar. You see, he’d been fighting with his lady. Anyhow, it was a quarter after nine when he called looking for a ride home and I told him, ‘No chance in hell. This episode’s about Desmond.’ So he apparently decided to walk from the bar and got hit by a motorcycle. Called me the next day to tell me all about it.”

“Right...well...put some pants on. We have much to do.”

“Hold on. I’ll buy your time travel story, if nothing else because you came through my ceiling like the fucking Terminator, but why exactly are you standing in *my* living room?”

“Please, Mr. Moore, put some pants on. I’ll explain everything on the way. Time, unfortunately, is not on our side.”

 

*Two*

 

She’s got nice tits. I took out a mailbox because I couldn’t stop staring at them. I am not a good person.

“Please, Mr. Moore, drive more carefully. We can’t afford an accident. Time-”

“I know. Time isn’t on our side. Where are we going anyway?”

“I’m not sure yet. My radio isn’t picking up a signal.”

“Your radio? Let me guess, you’re communicating with someone from your time? In 2049?” 

“Yes Mr. Moore. And don’t be sarcastic. You have no idea what’s at stake if we fail to complete the task.”

“I’m not being sarcastic. Just a little confused. Out of the loop, ya know? So please, do tell Ms. Livingston, what is our task? And stop calling me Mr. Moore. It’s Quincy.”

“Very well, Quincy. I’ll start near the beginning.” She takes a deep breath to prepare for the speech. Her chest expands as the air filled her lungs. Lovely. I hate myself for being such a sex-starved perv. “In the year 2035, the United States entered into a war with Sweden. Fourteen years later, in my present day, the reasons are still up for debate. The draft was instated and many of our nation’s young men were sent overseas to defend our freedom. But, while the U.S. soldiers excelled in texting their girlfriends and were superb at playing video games, they didn’t know how to properly aim and fire a gun. The U.S. suffered heavy losses and Sweden quickly withdrew from the war to save the U.S. any further embarrassment. The United States suffered 300,000 casualties in a little more than thirteen months.”

“Sweden? Why in the blue hell would we fight Sweden? All their men are like, what?  Six feet tall and blonde? That’s like having Michael Cera fight Thor. Fucking suicide.”

“Who is Michael Cera?” Knowing how irrelevant the answer is I don’t even reply.

“Anyway, the nation was in such a horrible state of despair and denial that it was looking at someone to point the finger at. And that was when a young senator from Montana decided to take control of the situation. Adolf Smi-”

“Wait...Adolf? Are you fucking serious?”

“I know, Mr. Moore. The irony is uncanny.”

“Totally.”

At this point, you might ask why I haven’t been a little more inquisitive about this whole situation. Well, to be honest, it’s not every day a sexy blonde with perky tits falls through a portal in your ceiling and tells you it’s your job to save the world. (The ‘save the world’ part comes later. Pay attention.). So, if this ever happens to you, I say just go with it. Sure beats updating your Facebook status or cleaning the litter box.

“Smith pointed his finger at the celebrities. He said they were to blame for the U.S.’s embarrassing defeat. According to him, the celebrities had withheld millions of dollars from the government - money that could have been used to ‘train more efficient soldiers and build bigger bombs’. And with the country’s morale being so low, and Smith having such a lovable face and strong speaking voice, it was an easy decision: the celebrities were at fault. His legislation was quickly rushed through Congress citing that every celebrity had thirty days to hand over fifty percent of their net worth or would be arrested, charged with treason, and thrown in federal prison. This was in the spring of 2037.

“Leonardo DiCaprio was the first to stand up and speak out against Smith’s new legislation. He’d said Smith was being unfair and that while he and other celebrities had publicly spoken out against the war, they had nothing to do with the defeat. On an episode of *Late Night with Daniel Tosh*, DiCaprio was shot by a crowd member, Alejandro Gallegos, who had lost two brothers in the war. He was a plant for the CIA.

“This single shot started the dominos. A chain reaction. That same night, there were riots in Chicago. The next night, they were in Hollywood and New York City. Teen pop sensations Kinky Keira and Jayme Rothesburge were partying at a club in northern Los Angeles and were savagely beaten, burned, and raped by a group of drunken rioters-”

“You hungry?”

“I’m sorry...what?”

“Are you hungry? There’s a McDonalds just past this light. I’m gonna get some food.  You want anything?”

“Mr. Moore, this is hardly the time, we’ve got-”

“Listen, Sasha. So far you’ve broken my table, pulled me away from my futon, and told me some silly story about a war with Sweden and a guy named Adolf attacking celebrities. And there’s a marginal chance that I’m gonna be late for *LOST*, which, if that’s the case, I’m gonna need a cheeseburger. Got it?”

“Yes. Yes, sir. This may very well be my last opportunity to alter the course of future events and-”

“Last opportunity? You implying that there have been previous attempts?”

""Several, Mr. Moore. This is my third mission in the past year, and there were others before me.”

Time-jumping. Looking for ways to change the future.

“As we speak, back in my time, the year 2049, a wave of military men is closing in on my camp’s headquarters.  If I don’t complete this mission, there is no doubt that they will overrun our camp, kill every one of my friends, and destroy our time machi-”

*“Thank you for choosing McDonalds. Would you like to try our new coconut frappe?”*

“No. I’ll just a take a double cheeseburger and large Coke. You want anything, Sasha?”

 

*Three*



Eating while driving while listening to some bombshell tell you about the future is not an easy task. Trust me, between eating a cheeseburger, drinking a Coke, trying not to stare at those tits, and comprehending the business of Sweden and celebrity murders, it takes some real effort to pay attention to traffic lights and speed limits.

Since leaving McDonald’s, I’ve learned that Sasha is a member of a rogue group of celebrities. She and her friends have been resisting Smith’s legislature by hiding out and making the occasional guerilla attack on military squadrons. 

“Our tactical strikes have been relatively unsuccessful and morale is at a low point. We’ve lost some close friends the past six months, Mr. Moore.”

She’s still playing with the radio.

“C’mon Suri. I need that address.”

“Wait a second...Something just occurred to me.  You’re a celebrity? I haven’t heard of you, and the only one I know with that last name is-”

“I am the illegitimate daughter of Ron Livingston. My mother is nobody special. Just some floozy he’d met at a club. I am not a celebrity and, truth be told, I had no interest in this nonsense at the beginning. But I realized the injustice needed to end. Innocent men and women were being held responsible for the mistakes of a foolish, blood-thirsty government.”

“Ron Livingston, huh? His career was all downhill after Office Space. Sorry.”

Her radio starts beeping.

“Yes! We’ve got a signal. Hang a left at the next intersection.”

“You can’t make a left. You actually have to go through the light and hit the turn-around.”

“Turn-around?”

“It’s a Michigan thing. Fucking stupid.”

“Oh. I’ve got the address. 396 Robinhood Circle.”

“You got it, toots.” I’ve always wanted to call a woman *toots*. 

 

*Four*

 

396 Robinhood Circle looks no different than 414 Robinhood Circle and 414 Robinhood Circle looks no different than 374, 426, 448 or any of the others. About an hour until *LOST* starts. 

Sitting in the parked car I ask, “What’s the plan?” The lights are on inside every house on the street. 

“The plan is simple. We enter the house and extinguish Adolf Smith.” 

“Extinguish? You mean kill?”

“Precisely, Mr. Moore.”

“Quincy. And how do you plan on doing that without getting caught?”

“Getting caught is of no concern to me Mr. Moore. The mission must be completed.”

“And what about me? I’m not exactly wanting to go to jail here. There’s only six episodes left!”

“I’m sorry Mr. Moore but this is how it has to be. It is your responsibility to recreate the future. Consider this: with the extinction of all celebrities, future generations will never get to enjoy quality television programs like your *LOST*. Can you imagine such a world?”

That one hits me pretty hard.  I, in fact, cannot imagine a world without television or movies. They’re the one thing that keeps life from sucking major cock. The moment of silence that passes feels like an eternity.

“I cannot make you do anything Mr. Moore, but I urge you to consider the responsibility placed before you. You can alter the course of history and guarantee that entertainment lives on for hundreds of years to come.” With that, she cocks her 9mm and offers it to me.

I’d had this stepfather once. He’s not around anymore. But when I was thirteen, he taught me how to fire a gun. We’d spend hours firing at various targets on his property up north. I’d never hunted or killed anything living, but many beer cans had met their demise at the pull of the trigger. That was nearly two decades ago, but I’m sure it’s like riding a bike. 

 The possibility of not seeing how *LOST* ends is devastating no doubt, but I’ve gotta suck it up for the future. I tell myself this will be the one truly decent thing I’ve done with my life. A necessary sacrifice, I guess.

“Alright. Let’s get this over with.”

 

*Five*

 

Standing at the door of 396 Robinhood Circle, I ask Sasha if she’s got a plan.

“Leave no one breathing.”

“Oh. Well, yeah. Sure.” I’m not looking forward to this at all. Hello America, meet your resistant hero, Mr. Quincy Moore. He stands at five-feet seven-inches tall, has a few extra pounds, unsuccessfully attended community college, has an unhealthy dependence on science fiction, and is a miserable excuse for a sexual being. “Should we knock?”

“Of course, Mr. Moore. I haven’t forgotten my manners.” 

A joke. It doesn’t help my nerves. 

Seconds pass after she knocks, and then the door opens. 

“Hello? Can I help you?” He has a German accent and seems on edge, looking us up and down. He has an imposing stature, taller than me and noticeably works out. 

Sasha responds, “Why yes. We’re here to kill your son.” And before he has a chance to respond, she snaps his neck and gently guides his body onto the floor of the home. I close the door behind me, pistol at my side and follow her lead. 

Coming from somewhere in the house, a woman speaks. “Steffen? Who’s at the door?” When we enter the kitchen, she screams, runs toward the drawer, and pulls out a knife. “Who the hell are you?”, she barks. “Steffen?” There’s no answer. “Steffen?!” They look pretty young…

“Calm down, Mrs. Smith”, says Sasha. “Your husband is dead”. I don’t know how she expects the woman to be calm after hearing that.

“What?” The woman lets out a cry and the knife is shaking in her hand. I’m nervous as hell but Sasha remains perfectly calm. “What the hell do you want?” she asks. 

“Your son, Mrs. Smith”, Sasha replies.

“What?!”

“Where is he?”

She’s shaking so bad now. Jesus Christ this isn’t good.

“Get the fuck out of my house”, she yells.

Sasha begins to approach her. “That’s not an option, Mrs. Smith.” Her eyes are locked on the woman. “Mr. Moore, please go upstairs. He must be in his room.”

With that, the woman runs toward the stairs. “Get the fuck out of my house!” She’s pointing the knife at us, ready and prepared to protect her son.

“Mrs. Smith, please. You’re embarrassing yourself. Step aside or die. Those are your only options.”

The woman’s crying, shaking, scared as all hell. A mother lion protecting her cub.  Sasha is getting closer. Nervous, I speak. “Sasha, what the fuck are we doing?”

“Please, Mr. Moore. I’ve got this under control.”

“It’s Quincy. Stop fucking calling me Mr. Moore.” I’m getting agitated now. I’m on edge and just want to get the hell out of here. There is no way this is going to end well. “I’m out of here. Good luck, lady.”

Sasha turns around to face me. “No! You’re not going anywhere!” What happens next happens quickly. It’s hard to recall the moment, but before I know what’s going on there’s a bang, Mrs. Smith is bleeding on the floor, my ears are ringing, and my hands are frozen to the gun. Sasha notices this and pauses only for a second to take it all in.

“He’s upstairs.  Follow me, Quincy.”

 

*Six*

 

My grip is so tight I can’t even feel the gun in my hand. *She charged. I reacted.*

The door is ajar and aside from a nightlight the room is dark. Sasha enters first and I follow, still in a bit of shock. It takes a moment for me to process that I’m looking at a toddler in a crib, sleeping. When the connection is made I have a meltdown.

“This is Adolf?  He’s a fucking kid, Sasha!”

“He is an evil man, Quincy. A bastard who must be extinguished.”

“The hell with that. I’m not killing a kid. You wanna change the world? You fucking kill him then. I didn’t sign up for this!” With that, I set the gun down on the dresser and head for the door. I can feel the blood rushing back to my fingertips.

She begs, “Quincy please! I can’t do this. I’m not meant to. This is your destiny!”

I pause at the doorway. “John Locke thought he had a destiny too, and look what that got him. Strangled, broken, and defeated. There is no destiny. Not for him, not for me, not for you, and not for that child. You can’t change the past, Sasha. Daniel Faraday knew that and accepted it. What happened, happened.”

“Quincy, please.” She speaks softly now as she approaches me. Still standing in the doorway, I feel her hand on my jeans. “I’ll do anything. This is why I’m here. To convince you…”

I look down and consider my options. It’s then that I notice my watch. “Peace out.  *LOST* starts in thirty-five minutes.”

 

*Epilogue*

 

Calling this an epilogue seems a bit silly. This whole story is a bit silly too, I suppose. But nonetheless it happened and as is true with all things that come to pass, they eventually become nothing more than fractured pictures; memories broken into tiny pieces, coming back to you at various moments throughout life. As I sit here writing this, I am filled with conflicting emotions. There seems to be a strange necessity to share this story with the world…knowing within days of its publication I will be gunned down by the desperate and violent renegades. Perhaps that is my destiny. If that be the case, I am very much at peace with it all. I made my choice forty years ago and have no interest in being a broken old man weighed down with regrets. 

I cannot help but smile when I recall that evening spent with Sasha. Her gorgeous head of hair lying upon my bare chest, the two of us covered only by a blanket watching *LOST* in a house belonging to neither of us, with freshly deceased bodies only feet away. She didn’t have a clue what was going on with the characters but seemed content enough in the moment. I find myself wondering where she is from time to time…Wondering if she’s still alive and wondering whether she thinks of me. 

When my accusers come, I will not ask for mercy. I accept the fact that in some way I’m responsible for the bloodshot of thousands. It was certainly within my power to prevent all of it. I will only ask them to consider this: could you have taken the life of a child? 

I certainly did my damned best to raise him…to teach him what it means to be a kind, caring and generous man. I knew what he’d become and did what I could to prevent this, but he made his own path and I can only feel disappointment for that. Perhaps he’ll be the one to put me to rest when he learns the truth about his parents. Strangled, broken and defeated. Destiny is shit.",1,1768070452.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

For the past couple of years I've been using the Goodal Vita-C patches as part of my morning routine after cleansing in the shower and toner pads. I had tried a lot of patches in the past for occasional treatment (Shangpree, Blaq, etc), but there are a few reasons why I loved these for daily use:

- I don't have specific issues like dark circles, just thinning 51-yo skin and these dealt well with hydration and morning puffiness
- they are thin, clear, and grip well so they stayed in place while getting dressed, making coffee, etc, so that I could get a good 10 min treatment before finishing my routine
- I loved the clean tangerine smell. It kind of substituted for coffee as my wake up signal 😊
- they are affordable ($18-20 for a 60 pack) for daily use

BUT I've been getting a reaction the last couple of times I've used them...not sure if it's because I got scammed by Amazon, but I don't want to buy multiple versions to test this out.

Since people in this sub have tried so many things, do you have suggestions for thin, clear, hydrating eye patches? If possible with a nice clean scent? 😊",1,1768070410.0,AsianBeauty,1,1.0,False
1q9bufq,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalbranding/comments/1q9bufq/how_i_stopped_dreading_my_own_contentc/,How I stopped dreading my own contentc,"I spent 18 months building a personal brand the ""right"" way. Consistent posting, authentic stories, professional headshots. The content performed okay, but I dreaded every single post because my face was attached to everything.

Then my industry went through layoffs and I realized something terrifying: my personal brand was now a liability. Future employers could see every opinion I'd ever shared. Every hot take. Every vulnerability I'd posted ""for engagement.""

I started researching how faceless creators build visual consistency without personal exposure. Most advice was useless. Generic stock photos. Cartoon avatars that screamed ""I'm hiding something."" Nothing that felt professional enough for the B2B space I work in.

The breakthrough came when I discovered that some creators were using AI generated personas that looked completely real. Not obvious AI slop, but consistent characters they could place in any scenario. Coffee shop working shots. Conference speaking images. All featuring the same ""person"" who didn't actually exist.

My first attempts were embarrassing. Midjourney kept giving me that plastic skin look, and the faces changed slightly between generations. One image would have blue eyes, the next brown. Totally unusable. A designer friend in a Slack group mentioned she'd been experimenting with APOB for client work and the face consistency was actually holding up. Took me about two weeks and maybe 50 generations to figure out what worked. The images that passed were the ones where skin had visible texture and pores, lighting created natural shadows under the nose and chin, and the eyes had that slight moisture reflection real photos have. The failures all had that smooth, airbrushed look that immediately triggers the ""AI"" response in people's brains.

I ran this experiment for three months across 47 LinkedIn posts. My real face content had been averaging around 38 engagements per post. The AI persona posts averaged 34. Slightly lower, but within normal fluctuation. What changed was how freely I posted. Without my actual face attached, I started sharing bolder opinions. Last month I wrote a post arguing that most ""thought leadership"" is just recycled platitudes from people too scared to have actual thoughts. Never would have posted that with my real face knowing my current boss might see it. Got more genuine discussion than anything I'd written in months.

The visual branding ended up more consistent than my real photos ever were. Same lighting style, same aesthetic across everything. And I can scale content without coordinating photoshoots. Need a ""working from home"" shot? Generated in minutes instead of staging my actual messy apartment.

I know some people will say this defeats the whole purpose of personal branding. That the ""personal"" part requires actually being the person. Fair point. But I'd argue the value I provide through my content is the same regardless of whether the face attached to it is mine or a consistent AI representation. The ideas, experience, and perspective are still genuinely mine.

One thing I want to be upfront about: I don't claim these are real photos of me. My LinkedIn bio mentions I use AI generated imagery. The persona represents my ideas and expertise, just not my physical face. That distinction matters to me.

Still figuring out video content though. Static images work great, but getting talking head videos to look consistent with the same character is a whole different challenge I haven't cracked yet.

The biggest lesson from this experiment is that personal branding doesn't require being personally exposed. The ""personal"" part can be about perspective, expertise, and voice rather than literal face recognition. Not for everyone, but for introverts or anyone who's felt trapped by their own visibility, there's now a legitimate alternative that didn't exist two years ago.",0,1768070404.0,personalbranding,1,0.5,False

If you’ve been lurking or saw the recent drama on r/gachagaming about Brown Dust 2 ""censoring"" everything, I’m here to tell you that the situation is actually a **massive win for players** (especially new ones) and the devs just dropped a ""nuclear"" apology package that you don't want to miss.

# 1. The Rewards: 100 FREE TICKETS + 16,000+ Diamonds

The Director (Jun-hee Lee) just released a huge apology note. Because they fumbled the communication on some recent updates, they are literally showering us with pulls:

* **100 Draw Tickets:** Straight to the mailbox for everyone. No strings attached.
* **16,000 Free Diamonds:** Every player gets 2,000 Diamonds per affected costume (8 total). Even if you don't own them, you get the base 16k just for being here.
* **Ownership Bonus:** If you *do* own those specific costumes, you get *another* 2,000 Diamonds each.
* **The Deadline:** You have until **Wednesday, January 21, 2026**, to claim the 100 tickets and the base compensation.

If you start an account today, you are looking at an insane amount of currency to hit the current banners (which are cracked right now, btw).

# 2. ""Censorship"" Reality Check: Is the game ruined? (Spoiler: No)

There’s been a lot of noise about censorship. Here is the actual tea based on the Dev Note:

* **It’s targeted, not global:** The changes are mostly for characters with ""underage implications"" (like Rou and Seir) to prevent the game from getting booted off App Stores/Steam.
* **Adult characters are SAFE:** The Director explicitly stated: *""There are no plans to make any further changes to characters that are clearly recognized as adults.""*
* **The ""Sexy"" Direction is Staying:** They literally name-dropped **Wilhelmina’s tights cutscene** and **Ventana’s coffee bean cutscene** as the standard they are sticking to.
* **Liberta Prestige Skin:** They originally tried to release it without the ""tentacle interaction"" because it was ""too niche/intense."" The community rioted, and the devs **backed down.** They are now recreating it *with* the interactions to be released in the first half of the year.

Basically, they tried to pivot slightly to be ""mainstream,"" the fans said ""hell no,"" and the devs immediately apologized and recommitted to the game’s ""fan-service"" identity.

# 3. Why Now?

Beyond the freebies, the **2.5 Year Anniversary** vibes are still going strong. We’ve got:

* **Free Wilhelmina +5:** You can get one of the best units in the game fully maxed for free.
* **500+ Free Draws:** Distributed over the anniversary period.
* **The Refund Policy:** They are being so transparent that they’re offering full Diamond refunds to anyone who doesn't like the costume changes. You don't see that in other gachas.

**TL;DR:** The devs messed up a livestream, realized they hurt the community's trust, and are now paying us 100 tickets and 16k+ diamonds to say ""sorry, we're still a cultured game.""

1q9bio8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9bio8,Heritage Coffee,"On my slow and methodical search for the best coffee shops, I stopped by Heritage Coffee 10/01/2026 Saturday at 10:30 AM.

My Rating System: I use Starbucks as my baseline (0). A score of +5 to -5 indicates how much better or worse the experience was compared to the ""standard"" Starbucks experience.

* Mocha Latte (Hot) = +1: The foam was nice. The mocha could of been better but still enjoyed it. 
* Decor = +1.5: I liked the marble floods and clean feel, but the trim around the counter looks like it could use some repair. Table I was sitting at did not rock or move and was big enough for my laptop and note book. I loved the pop of the green plants and the painting on the back wall. There was a power outlet not far from where I was sitting. Political items did bring it down a little. Note below on that. 
* Volume = +2: It clocked in at about 65 dB on my app. There was a few people. Easy to talk, no music so just a nice hum of the people and the coffee making witch I liked. 
* Staff = +1: Friendly people with smiles and you can tell they love where they work. basic uniforms but where they are still show their own style.
* Food = +0.75: Had the everything cream cheese croissant. It was flaky, but I personally think it was slightly over filled with the filling and over powered the croissant. The ice cream macrons was good but biting into it was very hard. You need to let it sit out a little to warm up or it will stick to your teeth a lot. Better than Starbucks but had to really think on it. 
* Workable = +2: Free WiFi is provided but will need to ask for Password \[I did not ask as I don't use public Wifi\]. Tables are large enough for a laptop and a notebook, there was an outlet close to my table but they are limited. The noise level wasn't to loud so if you had to take a phone call you could.
* Cleanliness = +1: Everything was clean from what I could see, tables could been wiped down some as they started to get busy they neglected in doing that. 

Notes: They had one unisex bathroom. When I go to a coffee shop I would like to go to a place that feels like a third space. Political items EVEN if I agree with it, I just wouldn't want it there. I know some may disagree and that is totally ok. If I where to remove my ""view"" on the political part of my rating [or if that was removed from view] I would say the Decor is 2. Some minor damage to wall and the counter could use some repair but it is a cute shop. Some may say I'm being anal, but this is my thoughts and please share yours if you like! 

Price: $6.00 for the 16oz coffee For the price, very happy

Croissant $5.00

Ice cream macrons $7.50

Overall Rating: Heritage Coffee scored +1.32 points higher than Starbucks as a standard.

I’m still refining this rating system, so I’d love your suggestions! I feel like using Starbucks as the baseline works because everyone knows what to expect there.

If you have any suggestions please let me know! I think picking on Starbucks as the base line is smart as everyone knows what to expect at Starbucks no matter of the location. When you go to a coffee shop, what are some of the things you want/look for.",20,1768069664.0,frisco,13,0.83,False
1q9bhzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1q9bhzu/the_oak_ridge_inheritance/,The Oak Ridge Inheritance.,"On April 2nd, 1989, my Momma died in her sleep. She was 82 years old. My brother Benji found her lying on her back with her eyes closed. I found Benji screaming, hunched over her cold body, slapping her corpse while big fat tears ran out of his wide eyes. I calmed him down, told him I’d call the doc, and sent him to wait in his garden. The barn needed cleaning, so after the call I worked while I waited.

It rained the day we buried her, like something out of a movie. A dull gray rain that lingered and made you feel wet even beneath your umbrella. Benji’s tears were all spent by then though; he’d done his crying before the rains, where everyone could see it. He didn’t talk for twelve days straight after that, like back when he was a little. On the evening of the twelfth day, he up and told me he was gonna clean the barn tomorrow. When I got up the next day, I found him swinging from the rafters. I’d stepped outside for my morning coffee and a cigarette, and saw that the barn doors were still open. I crossed the small yard that lay between the farmhouse and barn, passing Benji’s garden along the way. He’d just planted a few days before Momma passed, and already growth was overtaking the small plot. For all his faults, at least he’d had a green thumb.

The barn smelled of hay and dried dung and old timber. The wood came from the forests that once grew around the property. Our family had long since cut and sold all the timber, starting all the way back when Grandpa acquired the land. We were some of the first to settle in these parts, and the barn was likely one of the oldest ones in the state. The wood from the forest was good and stiff, as sturdy as a man could ask for. Benji’s body was stiff as a board when I cut him down. He landed in the hay. It sounded like a bag of flour, a low, dull thud. He kicked up dust when he landed, dust that caught the morning light passing through the open barn doors. I sneezed as I climbed down the ladder and inhaled the dust. It got in my eyes and made them water. The dust made me cry.

I poured whiskey in my coffee as I waited for the ambulance to arrive. I waited for a good long while. Our property was way out in the boonies. Technically, it all passed to Benji when Momma died. It’s just mine now. Lily pawed at my knee as I sat waiting on the porch. She whimpered and stretched her jaw into a wide yawn. Her canines were sharp and yellow. Benji’s teeth never did come in right. The ambulance pulled up the dirt road and passed the “Welcome to Oak Ridge Farms” sign Benji and I had painted when we were children. I kept my hands in my jacket as the men approached. The responder wore his navy blues, and he had a lip swollen full with tobacco. His partner looked nervous. We spoke for a moment, then I led them into the barn.

“Why’d you cut him down?” The lead asked. His name was Rick, and I took him for the lead cause there was no way in hell the other guy was in charge.

“Couldn’t stand to leave him up there any longer,” I said.

“You really shouldn’t have moved him. The police’ll say it looks fishy.”

I shrugged my shoulders at that. It was far too late to worry about how it all looked. I stepped back outside for some air while the boys called for the ME.

About two hours later, I said goodbye to the ME as he drove off with my brother’s body. The police had their questions, sure, but I’d been drinking buddies with the chief for years. He knew me, he knew Momma, but most importantly, he knew Benji.

“Damn shame,” he’d said shortly after entering the barn.

My mind was on the cattle out in the pasture, and the wheat growing in the fields. It was almost time for harvest. I had things to get done.

“He show any… signs? Ever tell ya what was on his mind?”

I shook my head no. “All he said was that he was gonna go clean the barn in the morning. It was the first and last thing he’d said since Momma died.”

The chief sighed and shook his head, “Damn shame.”

I walked the chief out to his car. He rolled his window down before driving off.

“I know you’re going through a lot right now. Just… take some time. Swing by in a few days, and we’ll get the paperwork squared away. I’ll go ahead and let the county clerk know you’ll be by soon, for the property transfer, and the dissolution of that, er, what was it called again?”

“Conservatorship,” I said quietly. “I’ll be up later, get it taken care of.”

“Right. You take care now.”

I watched the chief pull away, his truck kicking up a trailing ribbon of dirt that spiraled into thin clouds before settling in the grass on the sides of the road. He’d had a look in his eye, hadn’t he? A queer one? The kinda look you give a thug or an out-of-towner, not a man who’s driven you home countless times after one too many. No, no, I must’ve imagined it. I stayed outside a moment, pacing the gravel, hands laced behind my head. Thinking, ignoring the sting of sweat on my rope-burnt palms.

The paperwork all went through, and I buried Benji beneath his garden. There was some debate with distant relatives who thought he should be next to Momma. I didn’t want to do that to her, despite it all. I made sure to keep the garden intact. It was a beautiful garden.

That year was the biggest harvest Oak Ridge Farms had ever seen. Stalks of wheat taller than a man, with full heads of grain. I managed to pay off all the funeral expenses that year, with plenty left afterwards. I met a nice girl from the town over that year as well. Her name was Patty. Patty baked and sold her goods down at the local farmers’ market. She used Oak Ridge wheat for her bread and sold out every time. People couldn’t get enough of it.

But whenever I ate it, all I tasted was ash.

The herd was hit with a case of spring fever that year as well. The vet couldn’t believe it. Neither could I. Every cow that year gave birth to twins. Some even had triplets, all of them healthy and strong. The vet said he’d never seen or even heard of such a thing. The herd grew and grew, all of ‘em fat and robust. Patty started selling their meat at the market as well. We could charge whatever we wanted, and people would pay it. That’s how good everyone said the cattle at Oak Ridge Farms were.

But whenever I ate it, no matter how long I made Patty grill it, all I could taste was raw flesh and blood.

I could handle the wheat. I could handle the cattle. But what I couldn’t handle, what no one could handle, was the garden. It seemed to grow with a mind of its own, spreading every year, no matter how often I fixed the fence or trimmed the plants. Patty didn’t think much of it. In fact, she enjoyed the garden and its bounty.

“Looks like Benji’s still helping out from beyond the grave, huh hun?” She’d say with a smile. “I sure do wish I could have met him. He sounds like such a kind soul.”

I’d nod my head, but inside I knew something was wrong. The tomatoes burst in my mouth like pimples. The cucumbers cracked like bone. I couldn’t eat any of it. I couldn’t eat. Patty prided herself on preparing for each meal only what the Lord had blessed our farm with. She scolded me when she found grease stains on my shirt, or empty bags and cups in my work truck. The fast stuff was all I could eat. All I could keep down.

The worst came a year after Benji’s death, on his anniversary. I’d stepped outside to eject the meal Patty had made. I had to, otherwise it would curdle in my stomach. She didn’t know any of this. God, she didn’t deserve any of this. I’d barely made it out the door and leaned over the porch railing. I vomited right on top of Benji’s grave.

It was then I noticed the roses. They were magnificent; large flowers of deep lavender grew all across the garden. They grew as I watched, their petals blossoming, their thorns stretching longer and longer. I threw up again, and again. Their smell, their stench, was overwhelming. Like a field hit with blight. Like a dead cow left to rot beneath the sun. Like Benji’s room when he’d have an accident and Momma would ask me to help her clean it up.

In that moment, I waited for Benji. I knew he was coming. I knew I was about to pay for what I’d done. But damn it all, it was my farm. It was always supposed to be my farm. Why hadn’t she trusted me? Of course I was gonna take care of him; as if I’d abandon my only brother. To do that to me, to strip away all I had worked for and give it to an imbecile… what was she thinking? What choice did she leave me? My tears mixed with the bile staining Benji’s headstone as I waited for the roses to take me. I felt their petals lick my skin like the barbed tongue of the Devil himself. Those thorns inched near the crown of my head, and I prepared myself to die a wicked man, damned by my wronged brother, beneath the eyes of a just God.

Only Death never came. He whispered from the bushes. His voice laughed in the wind. But he never showed his face. The roses retreated, the thorns scratching my skin as they went, but leaving me otherwise unharmed. Patty found me there in the morning. My clothes were soaked with sweat, and she said I was shivering like I’d been out in a winter storm. I don’t remember any of it.

I still can’t eat the food. I take no joy in the fruit of my labor. But I no longer care.

Because there was another voice that night apart from Death’s.

And it said,

Wager Amount: 1.5U to WIN 1.95U

League: Los Angeles Rams vs Carolina Panthers (3:30PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: Jamal Murray was ruled out due to illness so we get a PUSH.

**Matchup:** I'm really confused af. Why is the line moving towards the Panthers? I was expecting it to go north of -700 on gameday. And I thought I was getting a great entry when I placed a nuke wager on -550, Rams are now -535  after they were -600 or above leading up to gameday. I kno Panthers are historically one the biggest home dogs and they did beat them in November, but I just think Stafford and the Rams are just way too experience in the postseason.

Well.. despite that if I am wrong on nuking the Rams ML then so be it, which is why I'll take the Rams TT TDs. The line movement worries me a bit because it indicates Sharp Panthers money, but if the Rams don't win they should at least put up points against this mediocre defense. Stafford and the Rams offense is too experience in the playoffs and he got tons of viable options, getting back reliable DaVante Adams. Rams third and fourth options are solid too! Tutu Atwell and Xavier Smith are great additions to complete this receiving corp. Not to mention their two solid RB as well, Corum and Kyren. Can't forget about Puka and Higbee as well! Rams did score 4 TDs on the previous matchup despite losing by a FG. I'll take the plus money on the Rams TT O 3.5 TDs today.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.5U on Rams TT O 3.5 TDs. Also wagering 1.15U on Rams TT (O 27.5). Stafford throw two TDs in the 1st half and Rams score 2 rushing TDs in the 2nd half.

This will be our first time in New Zealand - we have put together an itinerary based on a couple of online ones (the inafarawayland and weekendpath ones mainly).

We're keen for hiking several day-treks, seeing as many sites of natural beauty as possible, and also doing a bit of wine-tasting / coffee / a few nicer meals (although not a huge budget).

The only activity we've booked so far is seeing Hobbiton on Day 6. We've got two full days in Queenstown, but if we do a day-trip to Glenorchy one of those days then this only leaves one full day in Queenstown. Any advice on if it would be better to cut a day elsewhere on the South Island to add one here (perhaps Franz Josef)?

Would really appreciate any thoughts on route and timings - does it seem feasible overall? Any particular recommendation for each stop also very welcome. We still need to pick exactly what we'll do on each day in each location with potential options listed. Thank you!

I finally found a framework that actually works for building low-friction digital assets.

I wanted to share 14 specific hacks I've learned to help you guys save time and avoid the mistakes I made:

1. **Solve ""Micro-Pain"" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.
2. **Clarity > Length:** A 10-page guide that works is 10x more valuable than a 100-page book that is confusing.
3. **The ""Coffee"" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the sweet spot for impulse buys and building trust quickly.
4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a ""Version 1"" to see if anyone even wants it.
5. **Use Social Proof:** Once you get your first sale, share that it's working! It builds immediate credibility.
6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a magic trick; it's a repeatable system you can run over and over.
7. **Organize your ""Digital Office"":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.
8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.
9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it.
10. **Value First:** Provide 10x more value in the community than you do in your pitches.
11. **The ""Loop"" over the ""Launch"":** Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Use feedback to grow.
12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't rely on just one platform; build a way to reach your audience directly.
13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business.
14. **Focus on ""Evergreen"" Value:** Solve a problem people will still have 12 months from now to ensure steady income.

I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions about how to get started or how to find your first ""micro-pain"" point!

Just curious to know what is the general consensus when it comes to paying when dating in 2026?

For example, I would always pay for first dates because I am the one 99.9% of the time who asks the other person out and I think it's a gentleman thing to do. 

However, after a few dates, is it a red flag when women don't offer to pay or expect men to pay for all the dates? I noticed some difference between cultures. 

For example, when I went out with women who were raised in North America, some of them either offered to split the bill on first dates or cover small things (like coffee, snacks) after I pay for the meals.

However, I also have went out with women who recently moved from Eastern Europe or Asia where they expected me to pay for everything during a date. (Meals, smaller things like coffee, bubble tea, snacks, Uber/taxi to send them home, I don't have a car).

First date, sure, I wouldn't mind paying for smaller things as well but after seeing them for a longer period of time and this continues, is it somewhat normal in dating that men are expected to pay for everything on a date?",10,1768069003.0,AsianMasculinity,17,0.78,False

1q9b7pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nobuy/comments/1q9b7pb/frustrating_start_but_getting_back_on_track/,Frustrating start but getting back on track,"I ended up having several bigger expenses this week that were not planned 🥲 I had been on a waitlist to book a local kids museum for my son’s birthday party (on my green light list!) but I wasn’t sure when it would become available because it’s pretty sought after. So when i was alerted that my day and time was available I had to strike.

Next was my husband - he pays a monthly amount to a coffee shop near his work for unlimited coffee (it’s like $20 a month or something) and he said they offered him a full year with a $100 discount so he just said yes and paid up front for the full year. That happened to be on the same day as I booked the party 🫠 Not a great day for our bank account

Third is harder for me emotionally and where I was struggling the most with my mindset. I have a young child family member (9yo) that lives out of state. He came to stay with his dad to visit for christmas/ new years. Unfortunately his dad has severe mental health issues and struggles badly with alcoholism, and there was an incident that was very concerning, so my siblings and I had to intervene and remove child from that person’s care for the remainder of the visit. For the time child was with me I really wanted to make sure they had fun after witnessing something that I’m sure was traumatizing and scary for them. So I set aside my no buy rules for that time period to make sure the kid would have good memories of Christmas and new years rather than focusing on the negative things that happened. We did a lot of fun stuff, got pizza and soda, junk food at the grocery store for movie nights, a Christmas gift for the kid, etc. It was a pretty large expense at the end of it but I felt it was my responsibility as the temporary guardian of the kid to make sure we did a lot of fun stuff before he went back. I don’t regret doing any of it, and occasional family outings are on my green light list. But just all of these big expenses back to back hurts when I’m looking at my expense log 😬

Kid is home as of today so I am going to try to get back on track - except the only problem is we leave for vacation in a few days which is going to be another huge money sink. It’s my first time taking a vacation since I was pregnant with my son 3 years ago and I’ve been looking forward to it but it’s going to be a lot of work with a 2 year old. I’m going to stick to my no buy rules there as well as much as possible, although I named a few specific exemptions for certain souvenirs I want to get for my son.

It’s just hard because I was all geared up to have a really good start to this, but within just a few days all my plans and budgeting were completely blown. I am excited for this vacation, but also ready to get back to normal life again so I’ll be relieved when we have all of this out of the way and can really refocus on my goals for this year, which is to increase my savings for certain big house maintenance/ repairs, for my baby’s 529 account, and starting a retirement account for myself as a stay at home parent.",11,1768068964.0,nobuy,3,1.0,False
1q9b7ah,https://i.redd.it/al47kwjpckcg1.jpeg,Why do my oatmilk lattes taste so gross? [Breville Bambino plus],"Hi! Wondering what I’m doing wrong here. My shots look and taste great with perfect crema. If anything I might go a little darker or more acidic with my beans, but for the most part I’m really happy with my shots.

But when it comes to frothing the oatmilk and drinking the latte, I’m so disappointed. I feel like I’m ruining my perfect shots :(

I am using the barista oatly (if you have other brand recs im open to this! It’s just been hard for me to find other options in town). I make sure it’s cold, shake it up. Let the steamer run for a sec and heat it up before submerging the milk. I feel like I’ve finally gotten a good motion on the milk swirling perfectly as I froth. I do the thing where I let some air rip for 6-8 seconds then when the cup is too hot to touch, I submerge the prong deeper so less air gets in.

The milk will look PERFECT in the cup I frothed it in. I let it sit for about 8-11 seconds. I tap it on the counter. It’s nice and glossy. To the eye looks like a glossy thick milk.

However, when I pour into the cup with my espresso, what comes out looks like 1% dairy milk! It’s so thin as it pours from the spout. It looks ok in the latte cup I guess as it mixes and it gets slightly frothier near the end of the pour. I don’t care a ton about latte art, but tends to have a little froth sit up top. First few sips- texture is great. After about 3 minutes the whole thing goes flat. Tastes like I’m drinking dairy milk.. I can barely finish it. Grosses me out bc it just tastes like a cup of warm thin milk…

Any tips? I’ve been learning with watching a lot of tutorials that basically say the same thing. Whenever I first take a sip my thought is “this tastes so mid” Like a disappointing drive thru coffee

1q9b6ci,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q9b6ci,Rug size + placement help for studio living area (off-center couch),"I’m stuck on rug size, placement, and color for this living room and would really appreciate outside eyes.

The room is itty bitty (cozy!!).. about 8’11” x 11’11” per the floor plan. Couch is 7’ wide and deep green, floors are greige, walls are white, curtains are light gray. TV is wall-mounted opposite the couch. The coffee table is a long wooden bench.

One important constraint: the couch cannot be perfectly centered in front of the divider wall. There’s a Peloton that has to live in the window corner, so the couch is intentionally shifted to the right. That’s what’s throwing me off

Sooo… What rug size actually works here? 5x8 vs 6x9 vs something else? Should it go under everything or just the couch? Any color or pattern suggestions that won’t fight the green couch or make the room feel even smaller?
