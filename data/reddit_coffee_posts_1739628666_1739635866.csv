1iq4lwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1iq4lwg/has_anyone_met_any_of_the_actors/,Has anyone met any of the actors?,"So far, I've met the following characters:

Ziggy. He was shooting a movie with channing Tatum in Astoria queens. I was leaving the train and accidentally stepped on his foot. Quickly looked up and apologized profusely to the guy, thinking he was an actual cop. He laughs and goes ""don't worry, I won't ticket ya!"" Then I see all the cameras and saw channing Tatum and giggled and walked away. Didn't even think of getting a picture lol. 

Nick. He was filming law and order svu in the city. I was emerging from the train and tripped over a wire. Landed on my knees and he rushed toward me and asked ""you alright?"" I said yeah and hurried over to a clients office. Didn't even dawn on me until I saw the show a week later. In case anyone wonders, walking through sets of Law and Order SVU is a daily occurrence in the city. It's like walking through the woods and seeing trees lol. Thought he was just a camera guy or something.

Marlo. Took an elevator with the guy at my old office. My old office had a casting agency in it. Held the elevator for him. Acknowledged him..when I went out for coffee later he was standing in front..asked me how to get to the A train. Shook his hand and said I was a fan of his work on the wire. He thanked me. 

Bubbles. Caught him at a chocolatier in union square. Didn't speak or bump into him. Hard to tell without his normal appearance at first but when he took off the sunglasses it was obvious.

Met a slew of other actors from other shows, but this is who I met from the wire.

1iq4i7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Andjustlikethat/comments/1iq4i7z/what_were_the_all_the_little_things_you_liked/,What were the all the little things you liked since AJLT started?,"So, I’ve been hate-watching the show since the beginning and wanted to find a particular scene. I couldn’t do it—there’s too much cringiness for me with Che, everyone wearing high fashion all the time (even Che’s boss at the dog shelter, I mean…), Miranda, etc. I started thinking about why I keep watching the show and decided to make a list of everything I liked.

**I liked:**

* How the show is honoring its history by bringing back characters from the previous series. However, I didn’t like how some of them were handled. I always felt frustrated that characters like Susan Sharon (Molly Price) didn’t appear again in the show (Even if her return wasn’t a success, she had a completely different personality). I wouldn’t have minded seeing again the friend who was ashamed of his girlfriend or their old friend who was pregnant in season 1 but was never mentioned again.
* The friendship with Stanford, which felt very season 1 and 2. I hated how it evolved in Sex and the City, and I liked that they went back to the roots with this one.
* That she repurposed her Vivienne Westwood wedding dress.
* When she moved back in her flat in season 1.
* The convo with Steve when Carrie lost her ring in the drain. It felt real and was one of the rare instances where the two spoke, even if she did him dirty later…
* The conclusion of Natasha’s arc and the fact that she had her own life since she left SatC—she wasn’t just there blandly waiting for Carrie. However, I didn’t like how serendipitous it felt when they met in the coffee shop at the end of the episode.
* Charlotte’s arc in season 2—to me, she had the best one. Going back to work, finding herself again as a person after being a wife and a mother. When she told Harry that she understood he believed he was doing it all, but in reality, he was doing the bare minimum compared to what women are expected to do.
* How Carrie behaved in the last episodes of season 2—it felt the most true to her character in the original show and stopped making her act like an old snobbish lady (almost).
* The idea of Carrie doing a podcast, with the potential for season 2 to be a callback to when she was doing narration (sadly, it went nowhere).
* The idea of Carrie exploring topics of sexuality with her audience, but this one never materialized.
* The callbacks to Carrie’s clothes from Sex and the City.
* The idea of incorporating the kids’ sexual lives as a continuation of the show. However, they didn’t do anything meaningful with it and handled it in a gross way—pure buffoonery.
* Of course, that they succeeded in making Kim Cattrall do a cameo.

**On a more subtle note:**

* How they mixed the decoration of Carrie’s apartment with both how it looked in the show and in the movie, rather than keeping the movie version, which was ugly.
* That we got to see the hall of her apartment, the stairs, etc.
* That we learned Carrie was a nickname for Caroline.
* The [poster from season 2](https://imgur.com/a/oogQUE1) (except I'm realizing just now that Steve is the only one missing....)

1iq4i44,https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1iq4i44/am_i_a_bad_janitor/,Am I a Bad Janitor?,"So, I’m a janitor at a V10 law firm.  I don’t want to give too many details in case I dox myself.

Anyway, every night I clean the floors of this hallowed law firm.  Empty pellegrinos, coffee stains on the marble, and stuff in the bathroom you don’t wanna know about.  I start my rounds at about 9 pm, and there’s this one corner office partner, about 55F, who is always burning the midnight oil.  She’s beautiful!  For her, business casual means an embroidered black cashmere sweater with a wide neck, form fitting jeans 👀, and a cute pair of slingback heels.  I call her the Midnight Siren.  Never out loud, of course, because I’ve learned the hard way that people don’t like it when janitors say stuff like that at law firms.

Anyway, last night I saw her but she was in an awful mood.  It took three knocks before she let me into her office to vacuum.  As I asked her to move and vacuumed around her desk area (she was wearing YSL Libre last night, very nice), the Midnight Siren was glaring daggers at a young woman’s LinkedIn page on her phone and muttering darkly to herself.  

This was unusual, so I took a risk.  I asked her what was wrong, as she’s usually so happy even as she works late at night.  She turned to me and, with a resigned sigh, she said “I’m just about to ruin this junior associate’s Valentine’s Day with a false deadline on an MTD that isn’t even due until April.”  I maintained an understanding smile, but it hid my sudden lurching feelings of disgust and contempt.  How could it be?  The Midnight Siren was one of THOSE partners?  I made a quick excuse to leave, and her tall glass door seemed to echo in the night as I pushed it closed and reeled away.

As I pushed my cart down the hall to the break room (coffee spilled on the goddamn counter, again), I went over and over the interaction in my head.  Nobody is perfect.  Who am I to judge?  But the illusion was shattered.  I didn’t even finish cleaning.  All I could think was, I need to tell this young man that the deadline wasn’t real.  But if I do that, I’d be breaching the well established privilege for janitor-V10 partner conversations after 9 pm.

Is this progress or dystopia on a subscription plan?

**When AI Tanks Your Startup Dreams**

Artificial intelligence isn't just changing the business landscape; it's practically repurposing it into an AI theme park ride—and sorry, you might not have a ticket for the next loop. As ground-breaking and profit-making as it can be, AI also has the potential to do a slash-and-burn on traditional startup models. Imagine spending sleepless nights building your product only to find that an algorithm in a garage does it faster, cheaper, and without needing a motivational podcast.

**Who’s Winning? Not Always the Little Guy.**

- **Market Disruption:** Startups flourish by being disruptors. Yet, AI has cranked up the dial, making it a disrupt-the-disruptor game. New AI can create and iterate at a pace that makes caffeine-laden all-nighters look like a snail’s holiday.
  
- **Tool vs. Competitor:** Once a tool in your arsenal, AI can quickly morph into your fiercest competitor. The race isn't just about making the next big thing; it’s about surviving the bots possibly rendering your innovation obsolete.

- **Staff Replacement:** It’s not just hypothetical—AI is ready to take some jobs off your payroll. Do you really need a data-entry team when robots will do it in a blink and never take a coffee break?

**Laugh Through the Chaos**

But hey, who said this ride has to be a downer? Humor is your parachute as you plummet through existential business crises. Shakespeare didn’t write “AI, thy dreaded foe,” but maybe he should've. Use wit as your co-founder; it’s the only thing AI hasn’t learned to out-quip.

1iq4g5i,https://i.redd.it/hlqnqq0tsbje1.jpeg,Brewing honey process medium roast Pacamara,"Hello all!

Tl;dr: brewing above mentioned beans produced a bitter cup until I lowered water temp to 85°C

I recently purchased these beans (photos) and am struggling to pull out any “juicy acidity” mentioned on the bag. 

My recipe is as follows: 
[Hario switch]
- 16g beans
- medium coarse grind (6.2 on Ode 2)
- 85°C water
[Process]
- 0:00: (close switch) Bloom to 48g
- 0:35: Pour to 135g
- 1:50: Small stir to settle grounds (3 each direction) 
- 2:15: (open switch) Begin drawdown
- ~2:45: Pour to 240g, at a height to create lots of agitation, swirl, and wait to drawdown
- 4:30: brew done

The issue I’m having is that after troubleshooting the above recipe (going finer, coarser, changing recipe for more water in immersion phase/percolation phase) I’ve finally settled on this recipe that extracts a good amount of sweetness, but not much acidity. Also, any increase in water temp above 85°C produces unpleasant bitterness, even at a very coarse grind. 

Has anyone had this experience with this varietal of coffee? Or perhaps this roast is just a little too dark for me.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

That a lot of men tend to go into a relationship with the idea that they want something serious. What happens, again based off this sub, is that they meet some woman who is able to put up with their shit for the time being and stays with him for as long as he can. 



The worst part about this is that many guys will meet a woman from friends or either through dating apps. These two avenues are between ok and bad. Dating apps, especially the current setup of them, are designed to be a revolving door where people spend money and keep coming back. Side note, I have asked why people arent upset about dating apps monitizing love and they say that they would prefer they make money off them, prey talk.

  
Now, you have a guy who is somewhat desperate for a woman and an app thats feeds off desperate men. What happens when you combine them? You get mildy mediocre if not shitty relationships. 

  
The guys in these relationships are locked in because they know how hard it is to be back single and on the apps. As a guy who was living off the crumbles of dating apps, I can say this is a voluntary literal hell. I would compare it to sniffing paint thinner for fun, you know its bad and you feel bad afterwards.

It took me a while to get out and talk to women and start dating, it was a nightmare first but I would rather live a temporary nightmare that a daily hell. I even got my friends into approaching women as well. I am not sure why guys in friend groups dont wing for their friends? Like its so easy and even if it doesn't work, you guys lose literally nothing. 

  
Just a quick reference, I have been approaching for a few years now, I always approach when I am outside, whether going to the store or a on a trip I always try to make an effort of being social, not just getting womens numbers but also having simple conversations as well. 



Out of curiosity, I downloaded Tinder and Bumble last year and tested it out for a whole year while I approached. I made at least 5 actual approaches a week to get a number. Usually, I would do 1 a day. I tried to do this once a week but if I had too many numbers I would skip a week or 2. On average, I would get 2-3 numbers a week, roughly 40-50% success rate on numbers. after I got about 3 numbers I would start asking for dates, I would get several first dates and just as many second dates. By the 3rd date I would determine if I would date them or not. After about the first 2 months last year and 20 numbers I decided to start dating women, so I took about 4 months off, this was after several first dates and multiple second dates. After the 4 months, I got back into the approaching game again, still had bumble and Tinder btw. I was still able to get the 2-3 numbers a week, rarely I would get 1 number a week. By august I was in the same situation as before, roughly 20 numbers, going to officially have a woman be my gf. I started getting my guy friends into it, heard too many sob stories of catfish first tinder dates.  Dated my gf for a few months then noticed that she was not the one, so I ended it near the end of October. Got back out there again, but this time went even more into it, 10 approaches a week, got 20 numbers in less than a month. Noticed that during the holidays its a lot easier to approach. By the end of the year, I had gone on, I would say almost 70 first dates(yes walk or coffee, usually walk or hike), roughly 60 second dates(simple restaurant, under $20) and around 50 third dates($50ish bucks). I make only $70k a year, I am 5ft 8.5in, 175lbs, slightly balding. Now, the main part of this quick story is I compared it to the dating apps, I am the same person on the apps and IRL btw, After 1 whole year, making about 30 swipes during peak times on both apps 3 times a week, I got \*(drum roll)\*, ZERO MATCHES!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Which I sound like a cliche, but most average guys know they cannot compete on these apps. I learned it a long time ago and switched my strategy. 

  
So with that all that said, if you are still reading this, just know that you can make it happen, you do not need a fancy car or a lot of money, hell I even started going on dates with girls after telling them my car was in the shop for 6 months and they would pick me up. You just need to work on your health/body and just learn to talk to people, you dont even need to be suave or perfect, you will never get 100% on approaches, look at me my success rate was around 45%, while my success rate on datings was LITERALLY ZERO PERCENT!!!!! I push this because a success rate of even 1% is better than 0% so 55% is 55 times better.



That being said, why dont you want to approach women in public? It legal to talk to people in public under free speech and its not harassment if you walk away if they are not interested. So why arent you approaching?

The second season of Kosem portrays the constrasting approaches to authority and leadership of Kosem and her son Murad IV. Kosem, the de facto ruler during the regency period (1623-1632) and later the main second power, prioritizes stability through negotiation and appeasement, particularly with the Janissaries and Sipahis. In contrast, Murad IV adopts a rigid, authoritarian rule aimed at restoring the empire’s lost discipline and centralized authority through fear and brutality. This essay explores their leadership styles, assessing their effectiveness, implications for the Ottoman state, and broader historical relevance. 

To give some context, by the time Murad IV consolidated power in the **1630s**, the Ottoman Empire was experiencing **a decline in central authority**. The Sultanate had become increasingly **weakened by factional struggles** and subjected to the janissaries' endless demands and corruption ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Murad-IV)). We see these aspects in the show as well, with season 2’s opening scene being a rebellion, and we are made to understand that this has been a recurring event for a while. 

**Disclaimer : while I add some historical elements to assess the broader impacts of their actions, I am analyzing the actions of the fictional characters, not the real Kosem or Murad IV.** 

**Kosem Sultan :** 

Kosem’s ruling philosophy revolves around **maintaining stability and preserving the existing power structures**. She believes this to be the best way to ensure peace within the Empire and safeguard the well-being of its people. Her extensive charity work demonstrates her **genuine concern for the well-being of the subjects.** This approach has its merits—she successfully preserved the institution during turbulent times and established herself as a **figure of stability** that people could rely on for decades. 

However, her approach also has significant drawbacks. Indeed, we see throughout the show that Kosem has a tendency **to over rely on the janissaries**, as their support preserves her own power. Because of that, she is prone to placate them when they rebel, favoring sacrificing whatever person the janissaries have decided to hate this month (Musa Celebi for example), giving them money, and relying on them to unseat sultans who turn their back on her. 

While this approach has its benefits and **she often has understandable motives**, and it allowed her to remain in power for several decades, if you look at both history and the show, **empowering the janissaries so much proved to be very bad for the Empire on the long-term**. 

To fully grasp the implications of Kosem’s policies, I think it’s important to examine the evolution of the Janissary Corps **from a historical perspective.** For centuries, the Janissaries served as the **backbone of the Ottoman military**. Originally, they were an elite infantry unit composed of Christian boys taken through the *devshirme* system, converted to Islam, and trained to be the Sultan’s most loyal soldiers. Strict regulations prohibited them from marrying or engaging in trade, ensuring their singular focus on warfare and state service. They were a disciplined, highly skilled force, crucial to Ottoman military success.

However, by the late 16th and early 17th centuries, **the Janissaries had undergone a drastic transformation** that would alter the empire’s political landscape:

The abolition of the devshirme system: “*In 1568 a select few sons of retired Janissaries were allowed into the Corps, \[..\] The soldiers themselves seem to have favoured phasing out the Devşirme system so as to open up opportunities for their own sons, and by the end of the 16th century the majority of recruits were probably the sons of Janissaries. The Devşirme system effectively stopped in 164*8.” (the Janissaries, David Nicolle)  
**This shift weakened the discipline and military effectiveness of the corps*****.***

Many Janissaries transitioned into trade and landownership, leveraging their military status for personal gain. By the 17th century, many were no longer active soldiers but had instead become an elite hereditary class that **expected privileges** (notably financial ones) from the Empire without contributing to its defense.

Virginia Aksan explains:

*""The Janissaries had become increasingly ineffective and irrelevant to the kinds of warfare in which the Ottomans were engaged, partly because of a typical elite military resistance to innovation, partly because of the dissolution of their discipline and solidarity, and their gradual merging with rural and urban society \[...\]. They became small tradesmen whose main rewards were judicial and tax immunities, which they were increasingly unable to justify on the battlefield.""*

—*""Whatever Happened to the Janissaries? Mobilization for the 1768-1774 Russo-Ottoman War.""*

**They also became an obstacle to modernization :** 

* **Failure to adopt new military tactics,** which left the Ottoman military **becoming more and more outdated over time**. David Nicolle notes for example that they were reluctant to copy European infantry tactics in the late 17th and 18th centuries.
* **Blocking administrative and economic reforms:** Any Sultan or Grand Vizier who sought to **restructure the government, reallocate land, or implement tax reforms** faced Janissary opposition. Since the Janissaries were deeply involved in commerce and landholding, they had a vested interest in **preserving the status quo**, even if it **harmed the empire’s long-term stability** : 

*“They ‘The Janissaries” jealously guarded their privileges and fiercely opposed all military reforms aimed at undermining their status. By this time the Janissaries had evolved into a powerful social caste and political pressure group. They allied themselves with the religious establishment (ulema) and the guilds to guard their privileges and limit the power of the sultan and his government” (Military Transformation in the Ottoman Empire and Russia, 1500–1800,* ***Gábor Ágoston)*** 

***They became kingmakers and fostered a culture of rebellion :*** 

Their repeated **insurrections weakened central authority**, making it **difficult for any ruler to implement large-scale structural changes**. They had become **a state within a state**, answering only to their own interests rather than the empire’s needs. Them deposing and installing rulers became a recurrent thing : Mustafa I, Osman II, Ibrahim I, Mehmet IV, Mustafa II, Ahmed III, Selim III, Mustafa IV… 

This broader historical reality finds **a clear reflection in the show and notably though Kosem’s actions, starting in season 1** : Osman, who had big dreams and ambitions, saw the urgent need to curb Janissary power, while Kosem, ever pragmatic, deemed it a dangerous gamble. His vision aimed at long-term reform, but **her instinct to preserve stability and the status quo**, as well as her desire for revenge for Mehmed’ death, prevented him from potentially revolutionazing the Empire, and ultimately strengthened the very force that would continue to weaken the Empire.

In Season 2, we see a similar power struggle between Murad and the Janissaries/Sipahis. In S2E1, they storm the palace, directly confronting Murad and threatening to replace him with his brother Bayezid. Kosem, advises Murad to give in to their demands—something the show implies has happened repeatedly. Later in the episode, she personally assures the Sipahis that they will get what they want, reinforcing their sense of entitlement. Murad, understandably so, is deeply resentful of this dynamic, which is further emphasized in the same episode when Osman the Witch tells him outright, *“We are fine with our sultan as long as he agrees to our demands.”* 

The show also illustrates the Janissaries' unchecked power through scenes of them **extorting shopkeepers and terrorizing civilians** (S2E10 for example), portraying them as an increasingly corrupt and destabilizing force.

Of course, even in the show, **the trouble with the janissaries (and the sipahis as well) goes way beyond Kosem and did not start with her**, and as a woman her leeway was limited and it’s really impressive that she acquired so much influence on them in the first place (though sadly the show decided not to show us how she acquired it), however it’s also true that by being so reliant on their support and using it to maintain her own power, she reinforced their power and entitlement. **She was not the problem, but she was part of it.** 

Also while in history, we only have evidence that Kosem played a part in the deposition of her son Ibrahim (who was driving the Empire to the ground by his incompetence and was going to be deposed anyway) and tried to depose her grandson Mehmet IV, the show also makes her be behind both depositions of Mustafa I, the deposition of Osman II and an attempted coup against Murad IV (as well as the deposition of Ibrahim and an attempted coup against Mehmet IV), always with the help of the janissaries : this contributes to the weakening of sultanate authority, proving that a sultan **could be easily overthrown if they displeased certain factions.** She also helped this way to increase factionalism (which in end backfired on her) : by continuously **reshuffling power** to maintain her dominance, she **fueled instability** in the long term, the empire becoming **a battleground for palace factions**, as illustrated in the showdown between her faction and Turhan’s in the last episodes. 

Her reaction to the end of regency—despite Murad being 19/20—also reflects **her willingness to weaken the Sultan’s authority if it meant preserving her own power**. An adult sultan needing a regent implies he is mentally unfit, which undermines his legitimacy, both domestically and internationally. This is demonstrated when Farya’s uncle dismisses Murad as *“a boy hiding in his mother’s skirts”.*

Kosem’s approach to ruling in the show is deeply pragmatic—she prioritizes stability and survival above all else. In a political environment where power is fragile, especially for a woman, aligning with the Janissaries is an effective strategy. They provide her with the force needed to protect herself.  However, while this ensures her dominance for decades, it also has lasting consequences that she either **fails to foresee or simply chooses to ignore. She is both a victim of her circumstances and an active player in shaping the empire’s instability**.

**Murad IV :** 

Murad reacts to this growing instability with the opposite approach: **he seeks to reassert absolute monarchical rule through discipline, repression, and fear**. Rebels and traitors are executed, including sometimes in a deliberate public display of force like when Murad bludgeoned his traitorous Grand Vizier to death in front of the crowd, seeking not only to punish him but to instill awe and terror in his enemies (S2E1). In that same episode, he also personally murders the chief of the rebellious Sipahis. 

Murad is determined to have unchecked power over the Empire. **He does not just use repression against the army, but also against his own people**. After the Great Fire of Istanbul (S2E11), bitter that he has been blamed for failing to protect his subects, he begins imposing **draconian bans** : alcohol and opium are banned but also coffee, he closed the coffee shops and taverns, forbade people from walking at night without a lantern…It’s not all arbitrary of course, he notably targeted coffee shops and wine shops because they were places of public reunion and circulation of ideas, and thus possibly sedition. This was also his way to instill fear in his subjects, as he goes out himself to execute people who don’t follow the bans (S2E13 for example). As Sue Sylvester would put it : “*I (Murad) empower my people to live in a state of constant fear by creating an environment of irrational, random terror*”. People who live in fear are less prone to question authority (well at least in his mind). **Unlike his mother, who cultivates and embraces the people’s love, Murad ends up rejecting it.** 

He also executes the Sheikh of Islam, who while it’s true he was plotting against Murad, was I believe considered to be a sacred person and so his execution was an unprecedented act. And we do see that Murad keeps repeating that he is “the Shadow of God on Earth” to assert that he is **the only one with divine authority**. It’s also interesting to note that in S2E1, while Murad was facing a rebellion and janissaries asked for vouchers, the Sheikh of Islam was the first one to coming forward, yet instead of being grateful, Murad started hating him because how dare he thinks he can vouch for a sultan? He also has his brothers executed without a fatwa sanctioned by the Sheikh of Islam. Murad’s actions demonstrate his rejection of any authority beyond himself, including religious authority. 

**Murad also dreams of going back to the era of conquests and becoming a true “ghazi”** : “*The world - I hope one day to conquer it all. In St Pietro and in St Stefan we will perform Salat*” (S2E2). His crowning achievement comes from the fall of Baghdad : “*I have won the greatest, bloodiest victory they will ever be*”, he asserts (S2E25), a huge reach which showcases his desperate desire to establish his legitimacy as a ghazi, by bringing back military prestige. 

**His methods do yield tangible results**: by the latter part of his reign, janissaries have grown to fear him and rebellions decreased significantly, he had re-ssarted central authority and he successfully reconquered Baghdad, reaffirming Ottoman’s prestige.  

However, the sustainability of his approach is questionable : 

* His executions in masse brought a **huge human cost** to the Empire
* He over relied on fear and repression : while terrorizing opponents keeps order **during his reign**, he did not create any lasting institutions and reforms. His autocratic style of rule is indeed dependent on his personal presence. 

**His desire of restoring a Ghazi-style sultanate can also be seen as an outdated dream**. The Ottoman administrative system had become too large and complex to be governed purely through military leadership. Conquests were also not so economically sustainable anymore, as the advantages of fresh land, resources and tax revenue did not outweigh the strain on the state treasury anymore.

His terror-based governance was not **a sustainable model**, proving that **force alone cannot save an empire in crisis**. 

**The Question of Succession** : 

In terms of succession, Kosem is still presented as **the architect of the end of the fratricide law and the implementation of agnatic seniority** : the eldest prince is the heir, which means more often than not a brother rather than a son. After thinking about it for a while, I concluded that the logic behind it is that it creates a sort of “every prince gets their turn” framework : Brother 1, Brother 2, Brother 3, then son of Brother 1, then son of Brother 2 and so on, so there’s no need to kill them anymore as they all just wait their turn to be sultan in captivity. As the princes are confined within the palace, it creates a pool of inexperienced, often mentally troubled sultans, **which serves very well the janissaries and other faction that seek power** : if they don’t like Brother 1, they can just depose him for Brother 2, and so on, and those weak and inexperienced sultans tend to be more easy to manipulate. 

While Kosem is a proponent of this policy because she believes it to be **the best way to preserve the princes’ lives and she’s not wrong**, it’s undeniable that it serves her desire to remain in power. Murad is not completely wrong when he says “I go, and Kasim come, and then Ibrahim”, while Kosem **remains the power behind the throne.**

We also see that Kosem, despite always claiming to want the best for the Empire, is **not particularly interested in raising competent sultans**, on the contrary, we see that she hired Musa to keep Murad away from politics and undermined his first attempts at asserting himself. Nor does she seems particularly interested in using her power and influence to adopt a succession system based on the European model, where brothers of princes usually lived in peace (I want to point out that I know the real Kosem did not have the means to do that, but the show does overemphasize just how powerful she is). 

That said, I feel like it’s a bit frustrating to discuss the succession question and the consequences of the abolition of fratricide law because **season 2’s depiction of the Kafes system is kind of all over the place**.  Indeed, one of the show’s more puzzling inconsistencies is the way Kosem and Murad handle the princes confinement : while all princes are technically supposed to remain in Topkapi, **only Mustafa is actually confined** up till S2E22 when Ibrahim and Kasim get locked in the boxwood. It makes sense that they would see him as a potential threat—having ruled twice before, some might still consider him the ""legitimate"" sultan. However, the show does not commit to this idea in a convincing way. **No one in the season 2 ever seriously calls for his return**. When the Janissaries or Sipahis want to pressure Murad, they shout Bayezid’s name, not Mustafa’s. When they want to depose him, Bayezid is always presented as the obvious choice. Later, Kasim, is the one favored. Yet, while Mustafa is locked away in a guarded room, Bayezid, Kasim, and Ibrahim are given much more freedom, to the point where Bayezid even sneaks out repeatdly of the palace and no one other than his obsessive younger brother seem to notice. If Kosem and Murad were truly worried about pretenders to the throne, wouldn’t these younger, healthier princes be an even bigger threat than a mentally ill former sultan? This contradiction also makes Mustafa’s suffering feel less like a strategic necessity and more like cruelty. And though I understand they did to be allowed to involve more freely the princes in the drama, it does misrepresents the reality of the kafes system, making it seem like an more like an informal, loose house arrest rather than the **carefully maintained isolation meant to eliminate political threats**.

Murad eventually decides to go back to the old ways. Reinstating father-son succession, and then the practice of fratricide. Murad first starts taking the life of his brothers because they betrayed him : Bayezid (my poor boy), then Kosem wanted to dethrone him in favour of Kasim so he had him killed (yay) and then tried to kill Ibrahim so there would be no threat to his power. Then when he knew he would die, **he decided to end the dynasty with him, showing his lack of care for the future of the Empire beyond him, which is a glaring example as to why he could never be a truly great sultan.** Because of this, it’s clear that Kosem, despite her flaws, at least cared more than him about the futur, since a sultan from the Osman house, even a weak one like Ibrahim, is arguably the only way to maintain the existence of the Empire (there’s a reason why it was the same dynasty from the beginning of the Empire till the end)

**Conclusion** 

In the end, both Kosem and Murad’s approaches were flawed and neither provided a lasting solution to the Empire’s decline. I will say I believe Kosem was better because her approach was a lot more humane and pragmatic, and she cared about the people. However, if one wanted to play devil’s advocate for Murad, you could argue that he did have a point in wanting to reassert central authority and rein in the Janissaries, though he went out about it by relying entirely on terror and military power and that Kosem was too focused on maintaining stability (and her own power) but had no great vision for the future and contributed to the inertia of the Empire. The question does remain of whether it would have even been possible to stop the decline of the Empire. ",1,1739634937.0,MagnificentCentury,1,0.67,False

1iq495y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1iq495y/nagano_lean_body_tonic_my_uncles_surprising/,Nagano Lean Body Tonic: My Uncle’s Surprising Transformation,"I wanted to share a story about my uncle, Mike, who tried Nagano Lean Body Tonic and had some pretty unexpected results. He’s in his late 50s, lives in Austin, Texas, and has always struggled with energy levels, metabolism, and keeping weight off. He’s not someone who usually tries new supplements, but after hearing about Nagano Lean Body Tonic from a coworker, he figured, ""Why not?""

**Skepticism at First**

Mike had tried all sorts of things in the past—low-carb diets, intermittent fasting, even those green juice cleanses that claim to work miracles. Nothing really stuck. His main complaints were always the same: low energy, constant fatigue, and struggling to keep his weight in check. He wasn’t looking for a ""miracle cure,"" just something to help him feel better overall.

After doing some research and seeing mostly positive reviews, he ordered Nagano Lean Body Tonic online in December. It arrived a few days later, and he started taking it every morning with water, as recommended.

[Nagano Lean Body Tonic](https://preview.redd.it/9qfsepy5rbje1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e93b2c37903df6ca7ed15a39955d596008f0f01)

**Week 1: Small but Noticeable Changes**

By the third or fourth day, Mike called me and said, ""I don’t know if it’s just in my head, but I feel like I have more energy."" Normally, by mid-afternoon, he would crash hard and need multiple cups of coffee. But that week, he noticed he was powering through his workday without needing as much caffeine.

**Week 2: More Energy, Better Digestion**

One thing that surprised him the most was how much better his digestion felt. He had frequent bloating issues before, and within two weeks, he felt ""lighter"" and more comfortable after meals. He also noticed that his food cravings—especially for sugary snacks—were much lower than usual.

**Week 3-4: Weight Loss & Mental Clarity**

By the end of the first month, Mike had lost 6 pounds without really changing much in his diet. He wasn’t skipping meals or following any strict eating plan, but the combination of higher energy, better digestion, and fewer cravings made a difference. He also mentioned feeling more mentally sharp, which he wasn’t expecting at all.

**Two Months Later: Still Going Strong**

It’s now February, and Mike is still taking Nagano Lean Body Tonic daily. He says it’s become a simple part of his routine, and he loves the steady energy it gives him without the crash of coffee or energy drinks. He’s down a total of 12 pounds, and he feels like it’s easier to stay active. He even started walking more after work, something he used to be too tired to do.

**Final Thoughts**

Obviously, no supplement is a magic pill, and Mike knows that. But for him, Nagano Lean Body Tonic has been a great addition to his routine. If you’re someone who struggles with energy, metabolism, or digestion, it might be worth a try. Of course, results will vary for everyone, and it’s always good to check with a doctor before adding something new to your routine.

1iq48x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iq48x7/i_wish_i_had_never_taken_off_my_eye_patch/,I wish I had never taken off my eye patch..,"I guess I should start at the beginning. Years ago I lost use of my eye. It just blew up and stopped working right. Sort of rolls to the side and only saw distorted images. Slowly, over time, the distorted images turned darker and darker. Recently my eye just winked out. Total darkness. I've always worn an eye patch. This morning I was standing in my yard in the blowing snow and I took the patch off to rub my eye. I fluttered the lid for a second and looked around and, this freaks me out, I saw it. Just it at first. Only one. In the blindness there was this glowing thing. It was big, like about as tall as my garage. It had these moving, waving tentacles, lots of them. Each tentacle had an eye. It was walking, slithering, maybe oozing around the corner of where I think my garage is. Those tentacles were looking everywhere. It had six legs, hands, paws? Not sure. It seemed to stand on four and two were holding something. Spindly, sharp and squishy looking all at once. It had hair, but it was dripping ooze, each foot hand thing had curled dirty claws. I didn't scream, oh I wanted to but didn't. My breath came in sharp and I did jump back. All those tentacle eyes whipped in my direction. Under those eyes I saw light blue foam begin to drip. Drool? I fumble, my hands are shaking and cold but I slip my patch back on as fast as I could. Then turned to look at the creature. Nothing. My good eye sees snow, garage, my house. In order to get to my house I have to go by the garage. There was nothing there, right? Just some dead eye phantom. Not some impossible thing. I ran past the garage, up my stairs, sliding, stumbling, in the door, locked it, then just shook. Composing myself, I poured a cup of coffee and took my winter coat off.  
I should have let it go. Why didn't I just let it freaking go! I convinced myself it was some wacky fluke but I still walked over to the window. I had to see it wasn't there, right? So, I lifted up my patch and looked. There were tentacle pressed up against the glass! I counted 8, at least, they were squirming and waving in the wind. There was foamy blue dripping down the glass. Something caught my attention and I looked over to the street. There are more of them coming. So many more. Some with eight legs, some with two. Some with more fur, or scales, or extra tentacles. Each one a little different. Each one a walking, slithering sprinting nightmare!  
I sat under my kitchen table with my tablet and my coffee for awhile.  Every curtain is closed tight. I was afraid to move, afraid to look again, afraid not to.  
Eventually I crawled out from under the table and decided this must just be a fleeting burst of crazy. Impossible things certainly aren't possible, right. Deciding maybe I was just tired I got a snack and put some true crime on the telly to relax. A little snack, a little nap, I woke up feeling so much better. Maybe that was a dream? Sitting up from my nap I looked around. My patch had slipped off while I was sleeping. I didn't realize that when I opened my eyes. I scanned the room, just me. No monsters. See, just a silly nightmare.  
I took my patch off, absently tightening the cord as I walked down the hall to the bathroom. Turns out when I closed all those curtains, I forgot one. I looked out. It wasn't just a nightmare. Most of the crowd had wandered, skittered,oozed away, but a few were still out there. They didn't see me see them and seemed to have lost interest in me. Just wandering around doing whatever it is monsters do for fun. It looked like they were gathering things. Soil samples, snow, an old rusty bit of fencing. Why? What are these things? Have they always been here? I have a blind friend who almost never leaves her house. Does she see them? Or maybe, I'm just crazy?  
Sooner or later I'm going to have to go outside. I slipped my patch back on but not before I noticed a slight glow, a slight movement, from the other room. I think one of them may be in the house but honestly I'm afraid to look. Maybe if it doesn't think I've seen it, I'm safe? This is freaking me out. I have to know. Just one quick peek, what can that hurt?

I'm not really a cat person but for whatever reason she chose me and just sat on my lap for like 2 hours straight cuddled up. I didn't really pet her at all, I just let her be. 

About half an hour after I left the coffee place I started having these two little swells on my top lip which weren't hurting me but where kinda growing and feeling a little numb. I washed my hands and changed my jeans as soon I got home, and I've never had something like this before so naturally I'm wondering if this happened because of the cat. Also as I got up to leave she did kinda stick her claws in my leg trying to hold on to me but I don't see any scuffs. 

Right now the whole thing is kinda piping down, I don't think it's getting worse. But it's weird because I don't ever remember being affected by any cats that where around and there's no way I've never petted one of something like that sometime.

I’ve been making this coffee that’s supposed to have tasting notes of milk chocolate, vanilla and dark cherry and is naturally processed. I tried grinding coarser to reduce the acidity (1.3.0 on my k ultra). I was able to taste the chocolatey notes and the acidity was completely gone, but it was a little weak for me. (5 pours). I ran out of that coffee so I ordered another bag and after resting it for 7 days, it is now tasting acidic again even on the same coarser grind setting, temp, etc. (brewing at 88c).

I have been baking for quite a while and tried to dabble into the world of milling my flour at home. Im usually using spelt for bread and starters. So I bought some spelt and milled it (apparently my mill was a coffee mill haha). The flour was really coarse, more like semolina. It killed two starters which were in perfect health before. I have noticed, that the smell was straight up vinegar instead of lightly acidic. 

  
Has anyone experienced this before? Or did I just flunk two starters by chance? In case this is important, I didnt let the ""flour"" rest for the appropriate amount of time.

I’ve been mining Pi since 2021, and I've never had any trouble logging into my account at all until a couple of mornings ago.

It gave me the option to log in with Facebook (which is what I should have done but didn't), or login with phone number.

So I entered the password I was pretty sure I used when I set up my account and I pushed the continue button, and that's where my troubles really began to become apparent. I didn't take the time to read what was on the screen, but instead just entered phone number and password. I thought I was logging in to my account when in reality I was creating a new account. Now that I'm thinking about it I realize that I set my original Pi account with my old phone number, and I think maybe my old phone number still on my account, but I haven't used that phone number in 2 years. I have changed phones a couple of times since I’ve had my new number, and have had no issues being able to log into my Pi account with a new phone but I must have logged in via Facebook.

I myself am 30 but get along better with women in their 40s and 50s including elderly women. I have noticed how older women value friendships more and have more time for their girlfriends than women of my age and younger ladies. I tried befriending younger women and every time when I call them over for some coffee time they always come with a excuse like “I can’t, I’m busy” or “I have other things to do” and then you see them spending their times with their boyfriends instead, they put other people in their lives aside and put their boyfriends on a pedestal like they are a God, even my 2 year younger ex BFF said that her boyfriend is her best friend, she doesn’t have any friends only me. It’s sad to see how many young women ditch their girlfriends for their boyfriends who are sooner or later going to dump them anyway. You don’t see this behavior in men, they are still there for their buddies and even consider them more important than their girlfriends (bros before hoes) but with young women this is sadly a big issue. Older women don’t act this way, even though they are busy with work, housechores, their husbands and children they still find a way to spend some time with their friends. I have also noticed how older women get tired of their husbands and prefer company of their girlfriends instead. They also have stronger bonds with their girlfriends and longer friendships that last for many years. I hope that younger ladies will grow out of this behavior and learn something from older ladies, to value friendships with girlfriends more otherwise they would end up alone if they keep behaving like this. Maybe you younger ladies should stop ditching your girlfriends for your boyfriends and look up to older women instead. Also no offense, I didn’t mean that all young women are like this but the fast majority are unfortunately.",0,1739633580.0,women,4,0.25,False
1iq3u3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1iq3u3y/29_m4f_compliments_matches/,29 [M4F] Compliments > Matches,"Here’s a theory: maybe we should build relationships based on complementing interests instead of just similarities. The best connections aren’t always built on sameness but on balance. Like coffee and cream, peanut butter and jelly, or grilled cheese and tomato soup—sometimes the best pairs are made of differences that bring out the best in each other.

Hi there! I am 29 years old, from Quezon City, and a budding entrepreneur in the coffee and food industry. My work revolves around crafting great experiences and connecting with people, but at heart, I’m more of an introvert—a homebody who enjoys the quiet just as much as the energy of a busy café.

I believe that shared values and beliefs are the bedrock of any real connection—things like respect, ambition, kindness, and a sense of purpose. But beyond that foundation, differences in personality, interests, and perspectives add depth and make things interesting—the way a steady drumbeat grounds a melody or a cool breeze makes a warm day perfect.

I’m looking for someone who doesn’t just reflect me but complements me—maybe you’re more spontaneous where I’m structured, or more laid-back where I’m always on the move. Some of the best things in life come from balance:

* **Sun and Moon** – One thrives in the spotlight, the other in quiet moments, but together they create harmony.
* **Salt and Caramel** – One sharp, the other sweet—individually great, but together, richer.
* **Waves and the Shore** – One adventurous, the other steady, yet they shape each other over time.
* **A Bonfire and the Night Sky** – One brings warmth and energy, the other brings peace and depth.

I am someone who appreciates thoughtfulness, ambition, and someone who enjoys both fast-paced and quiet moments. If that sounds like you—or if you just want to ""argue"" about the best way to brew coffee or maybe tea— my inbox is open. ",11,1739633569.0,PhR4Dating,0,0.92,False

I miss a life with you that has never happened. Or maybe it has in some other life. Maybe my fingers traced your face while you slept before waking you with my sweet call of your name before snuggling back into you, both of us just wanting five more minutes. Knowing us, it would be five more minutes endlessly. I miss planning our day together and sittng in the living room you playing your space cowboy game while I crochet a pillow that is for our place instead and when either of us get up we need to show our love first, a sweet kiss on the forehead, a hug from behind. I miss the quiet debate about what new thing we will make for supper. I miss knowing the ones you love, the ones you've told me somuch about. Especially her, I find her inspirational, her bravery and tenacity, how she raised you. When you tell me about her, I wonder what she would see in me with her gifts. I miss kissing you goodnight before we fall asleep in our arms. I miss kissing you goodbye before you go to work, before you see your friends. I miss giving you the space to be you, to have what you need to feel fulfilled. I miss the cats we would have, undoubtedly named after gods of an older world. I miss snuggling on the couch watching supernatural, which you can qoute far better than I. I miss reaching into your closet and bundling up in your sweater because I miss you. I miss the road trips where we have to stop multiple times just to be close to each other. I miss a life that I haven't had in this one, but it must have happened before, or how could my heart feel such deep sorrow for it? See, I wish it was us too desperately. I catch myself daydreaming of it all the time. To be able to be there when you get to see the things you have always wanted to. To be more than just a part of your happiness, to love you tenderly and watch you be and do all the things you need. To hold you when you're lost, to let your tears stain my shirt. To love you whole through the good and the bad and the bleh. To make you dance with me in the living room just to see you smile again. I haven't ever thought like this about another before. I kinda just thought I was selfish, but it's just that I haven't loved the way I love you. My love, even now it is you.

I'm 19, and for future reference in this, I've only ever been with one person and she's another woman with no health issues. For the past 8 months to almost a year, I've had some sort of infection going on. It started off with an off smell, sort of sweaty or milky. I was worried I was getting a yeast infection because I had one before but the first time I had it, it got taken care of immediately and that was about two years ago. Then I started getting extreme discharge. I know discharge is normal but this was so much that I would have to clean myself every few hours in the restroom. I thought maybe it was yeast again so I got treatments and nothing helped. I've been to three different doctors and they've ran every single test and every one said negative or that my pH was good as well. The only thing I haven't had done was a transvaginal and they haven't done a pap smear either (at least where I live that doesn't get done until you're 21). The past 4-5 months my periods have become so unusual as well. I never once had issues with them until this started but now I hardly bleed and when I do the blood is almost black. 

I have changed everything, my soap, my clothes, new underwear, laundry detergent, I have started using flushable wipes the past two weeks because I thought maybe I just wasn't clean enough. Nothing I use is scented there either and of course I do not do anything out of the usual. I have not had sex with said female partner in two months and before that, it was only maybe once a week but whether it was with fingers or toys, it was always painful after. Sex has never felt normal for me  and the first few times we did things I almost couldn't walk for three days out of pain. We also did everything right and did not force anything, used enough lube, whatever. 

I have used multiple different pH balancing vitamins that my gynecologist recommended and some friends have recommended, nothing changes. The most that improves when taking vitamins is the smell disappears. I drink so much water its sickening and I force down cranberry juice as much as possible. I've changed my diet, I try to eat so healthy its almost insane. I change my underwear so often as well. 

I am insanely worried that it's something more serious. Family history wise, my mother has endometriosis and thats it, which the gynecologist also said is probably not my case. I have not felt normal in almost a year and it is stressing me out. I even cut out coffee and other caffeinated drinks, thinking maybe the acidity could be causing issues.

* **ASL**: The toxic ""king"" of SPTV, at minimum a narcissist or worse a narcissistic sociopath. A bad boy with a wife and children he keeps on a shelf and at least two women he ""dates"" on the side and multiple women he's ab7$3d. Destroys anyone who challenges him or who he just doesn't like for whatever reason.
* **Jenna**: The current queen of SPTV who is being trotted out to convince viewers that the breakdown in their relationship is not ASL's toxic behavior--having a wife and other girlfriends and other women--but her fault because she's a ""psycho,"" a classic narc move by the way to reverse victim and offender.
* **Natalie**: Switzerland. Her nothing-to-see-here silence co-signs ASL's bad behavior, leaving the narc king's behavior unchecked. Or is she just afraid to be in Nora's shoes?
* **Nora**: ""The Crazy One,"" another classic narc move called the smear campaign. When a narc can't manipulate you into silence, they'll go on a smear campaign, making the victim look crazy or like the problem. Most often the victim is triggered and reactive from long-time abuse, so their triggered behavior plays right into the smear campaign's narrative.
* **Reese**: Does she even count? Sure. ASL helped her start a channel, but she's on her own path and mission. Has been diagnosed with a cluster B personality disorder, per her own admission. Probably a grifter with her crim fiance. Has no interest in SPTV but working hard to keep the peace with the toxic king while being thrown under the bus by him a few times.
* **The Coffee Ladies**: Just gnats buzzing in our ears with their ""opinions"" that further smear campaigns and ASL's narratives under the guise of neutrality. ""They don't agree with ASL's behavior,"" but they're here to jump on his narratives.
* **Feral Cheryl**: The king's servant who will do his bidding on command.

Hubby is helping with it, plus have a masterhop and sell things on etsy. I am working as mid-level software developer. I work from home.
Summer is coming and I am absolutely dreading it. No one has told me that I must help with farm or garden. But I feel like I have to do it all, cook, clean and do work outside in yard. I should be helping his mother with garden. I do help a bit, but is not enough and I do not spend every free moment I have working outside the house.

We cannot go away for vacation during summer because of farm work, and in Winter have to have someone heat the housue for us while we are away.

I mainly smoke American Spirits so I purchased a tin of Spirit Blue tobacco (which came at a hefty cost that I should’ve had foresight to avoid) but then realized the tobacco seemed quite strange and bad for rolling. 

It didn’t have the fluffy quality or many ribbons/strands that I’ve felt the few other times I’ve rolled, and no matter what I did, how tight or loose I packed it, when I smoked that tobacco it always tasted a bit acrid and unpleasant. Maybe a stroke of bad luck gave me a bad tin? 

Anyways, I’d like to avoid that experience again but I have a bit of a conundrum. My favorite cigarettes are American Spirit Blacks - despite the fact that they kinda smell like cat piss - because of their deep, rich, almost nutty flavor and the way they pair with coffee. I’d like to find a rolling tobacco that also has that kind of deep rich flavor and strength. 

I know this applies to almost every rolled cigarette but I need to feel like I’m inhaling smoke to enjoy a cig. I can’t stand Camels for their sweetness in addition to the fact that they’re incredibly weak. I like the attack on the lungs, it’s part of the experience for me, and reminds me to only smoke one or two (or maybe if stress hits, three) times per day. 

So, if any of you have recommendations based on that, I’d very much appreciate it. Sorry it was a bit of a rant.

Chai doesn't always have spices but it can have things like ginger, cardamom, black pepper. Even without those the basic recipe is simple - milk, black tea, sugar, boiled together.

Coffee doesn't have this problem either. A bit of googling suggets reheating tea releases more tannins and makes it bitter. Is that the only reason? It also seems to lose spice flavor unlike other dishes. Any way to counteract this?

Then we were talking a little about some of our dating experiences and he said he’s been asked some surprising questions on his dates. He said I’ve in particular really caught him off guard.

About a month ago, I met someone on sa who I exchanged almost over 300 messages with, and we proceeded to talk over WhatsApp for about a week. It was highly mentally stimulating, he is a confident man himself so there was back and forth banter. There were 2 instances in which he annoyed me, but we talked it over and the second time I withdrew he “caved” and sent the first message to reestablish contact. 

Now, for me I don’t do coffeedates and he wanted to, we ended on the note that he could contact me when it he is open for an initial dinner date but now I look back and understand, given that he had just had a negative experience with a dinner date. Now we haven’t texted for about a month, and now im wondering how it would be if we would meet and want to say to him that we could (but then do like a more fancy coffee date) but I don’t know if I am going to completely fuck the dynamic if I text him again.. 

I would text him and say that I did enjoy our conversations and would still be up for meeting for a coffee date (in my city, not in his as he proposed) if he is cool. He only hid his profile picture from me but didn’t delete me, which makes me think that he also knows we’ll talk again but he doesn’t know when)

I wanted to mention a few things which I feel are under-discussed which I have found to be important in my healing.

I am 31. I discovered corn at age 8 & have been addicted my whole life except for a 5 year period when I was in a good relationship in my early 20's.

WARNING # 1)

DON'T DO CHEM SEX or use drugs to amplify dopaminergic activities - including gym.

I smoked THC + poppers + caffeine & would have threesome marathon sex while watching corn. For months. You will just time travel forward into the future in a haze. I barely have memories of this. It warped my sexual tastes. I ended up dating trans ""girl"" (I am straight) & got sucked into a sexually loose world. The devil is beautiful. The memories & subconscious impressions come at great cost.

WARNING # 2)

DON'T VAPE THC & WORKOUT even though it's awesome (if you're gonna do it, 60/40 sativa/indica strains are best...). This habit ruined my life, & melted my brain.

Sophomore Year of college got into bodybuilding because I liked getting high off DMAA / Ephedrine in old C4 pre-workout product. Discovered hedonistic pump chasing. At age 29, I smoked cannabis for the first time and decided to try it pre-workout. It's awesome, but I am powerless to stop. Once I start, I'm high 24/7 until my supply runs out. It melted my brain, dopamine, subconscious, etc. In addition to wrecking your dopamine, THC stimulates the nervous system & makes post workout urgers unconquerable.

WARNING # 3)

Material success (including looks maxing) is meaningless. I graduated top of my class, have the body of a Greek god, lead every team I worked with (I'm a programmer), & was a millionaire by age 27, but have been suicidal for most of my life, excepting some good years. Severely. I almost killed myself many times, including most recently, but a synchronicity (phone call telling me my brother was expecting his first kid) stopped me milliseconds before I pulled the trigger. I'm now trying to believe in God.

WARNING #4)

The ""whatever it takes mindset"" (engendered through extreme things like bodybuilding or high caliber success) is a double edged sword and carries with it unique risks. When we think of things like disciple, we often only think about avoiding bad stuff; we neglect moderating good behaviors. Limiting positive behaviors is necessary to build discipline & train the body to obey. Don't say, ""I'm gonna study for 8 hours"" and then only study for 4. This will train a greedy & disobedient mind.

TIP #1)

Spend more time in silence. Fuck your phone. The pain of boredom is evidence that healing is taking place. Stimulation of the sense organs is a WAY bigger problem than I ever could have imagined. It is a primary root cause of a disturbed mind. Yoga says that vital life force energy (Veerya) leaks through the sense organs (Indriyas). Pay attention to how you feel after consuming ANYTHING. I don't allow my eyeballs to gaze upon ANY scrollable menu, and this has helped - news feed, YouTube. I used to think that listening to educational podcasts was innocent, or listening to self-help type YouTube videos was innocent. It is not. More information won't help. You already know the answer. See the impulse that you have to seek outside of yourself for something that lies within. That impulse is a lie and it isn't you. Become aware of things that stimulate the nervous system (thinking, reading, consuming, emotions, coffee, etc). Dopamine is the drug of all drugs, and it lies in subtle forms. Silence (and things like Yoga, meditation, prayer) train the subtle perceptions to gain awareness of the subtle costs of everything. Discover for yourself how destructive things are which are viewed as benign.

TIP #2)

I've been unemployed for 2 years now, and have SEVERE difficulty concentrating for interview prep. I can effortlessly do 5 hot yoga classes every day & can maintain an impeccable diet but can go for months dumping my clean clothes on the ground in my room, unable to clean it. Recently, I looked at my bank account for the first time in 2 years to see how much cash is left. I have had chores I tell myself I need to do, daily, which I haven't been able to do in the last 2 years - like go to the USPS website and submit a change of address, cancel old gym membership I'm still paying for, change billing address on financial websites, etc.

Last November, I made it 3 weeks on monk mode + no fap, here's what finally helped me:

I tell the mind ""I am willing to waste an entire day. Day after day after day. What is permitted is sleeping, eating, studying, or meditating. That's it. Productivity be damned."" Be willing to waste the whole day if that's what it takes. Eventually, the mind will fall in line. This technique of strong tyranny helped me get my first bit of success.

TIP #3)

In the difficult acute phase of quitting drugs & PMO, Ibuprofen helped me with the depression / withdrawal symptoms (could be the Interleukin-6 receptor, idk). Don't take it just to feel better - use it so that you can take the next step in your plan. It gives me 90 minutes of relief which can be applied towards doing the next useful thing - I use it to get out of bed, get into the cold shower, get liquid food in me, get sun exposure, etc. Helps with the suicidality.

TIP #4)

As a severe insomniac (hot feet, restless leg syndrome - goes on for 4+ hours all the time; it's miserable), here are some things that help. Remember the misery of insomnia in the moment and use the misery in visualizations when functioning during the day. When it's time to force yourself up & into the sun in the morning & you don't want to, visualize the misery of lying in bed awake and ask yourself what's worse.

TIP #5)

Momentum / a taste of success begets hope. My \~3 weeks of success during my last run (in November) was the first experience in my adult life of alleviation from my suicidal symptoms. Clinging to this experience has been making subsequent progress much easier.

OBSERVATION #1)

Running from hell (negative emotion; avoiding PMO) won't get you to heaven (positive emotion; highest ideal). From age 21 - 25, I dated & lived with a women who was 20 years older than me. We had sex daily, my circadian rhythm was stable, and my domestic life was analgesic for tolerating my unpleasant career. I was pretty happy. I probably rarely, if ever, did PMO during that 5 year period. 2 years ago, my best friend died unexpectedly at age 37 and I realized immediately that he was the only source of positive emotion in my life. That + quitting my job was the beginning of a decline.

I don't know the answer to how to get to heaven; I'm working on this. But I have seen enough in life to understand that heaven & hell are two separate axes.",1,1739632004.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False

I’ve set my boundaries firm and there’s probably one or two blow-ups a year when he hits that boundary (intimacy will not happen when he’s drunk, hungover, or high) and we have the same conversation:

Q:
There’s something else going on you aren’t telling me. Is there someone else? Is there something else I’m not doing? We haven’t had sex in _____ weeks. You don’t hug me or kiss me or initiate sex with me. Is there someone else? Are you depressed? Do you need to see a doctor for your low libido? Yeah, I like to numb out. [Insert top four major stressors about his life at the moment.] This can’t just be because of my drinking and smoking habit. 

Me:
It’s about your smoking and drinking. I’m not sexually attracted to you when you are actively in heavy use, and it doesn’t go away by taking a day or two break from it.

Q:
It can’t just be about that… [continue trying to pick a fight to argue that I should be wanting sex with him.]

Me: I’m not going to nag you and throw your drinking and smoking in your face. You get to live your life the way you want. I might not be attracted to what I see and I might not want to hang around to watch.

And from there I usually find a way to end the conversation. 


Cut to yesterday. I’ve been blunt with him. We haven’t been intimate for over two months. I haven’t seen him sober in over two months. He leans in for the kiss, I can already smell the bong water and smoke on him. I don’t meet him for the kiss. The smell disgusts me. He walks off in a huff and slams the door behind him. I text him later that he should wash his beard after his workout so I can get my kisses in. 

So he feels his feelings and walks to the store to buy beer. I know I don’t have to remind this group that yesterday was Valentine’s Day. He wants to have a serious conversation while he drinks his beer. Normally I wouldn’t do that but I let it slide and remember to grey rock if I need to. The Conversation I outline above begins and I assuage his fears that I am cheating on him. I deflected the rest of the convo to sometime this weekend, he can chose to be dry and we can have a real conversation about all of this. 

So here’s the crux: I happily slept last night. But now I’m coffee in hand and journal in front of me. I want to write my magnum opus for this conversation and then give it to him. I don’t want to have this painful conversation anymore. Can I do this and not backslide into obsessing over his SUD and his actions? I can’t go back to that.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

He initially wanted to just crash in my sofa but I decided to just room with him to save up on costs since we're still both university students (I'm enrolled in UBrite while he's in Foxbury). I know our universities have this rivalry going on but honestly, living with him was great. We kind of have a system in place where I'm in charge of the meals while he cleans up the place. He also loves his coffee and would brew one every single time. Even though I always complain about how he just always leave them to spoil, deep inside I appreciate that we always have coffee ready especially on nights where we both have to stay up late finishing our courseworks.

So naturally, I fell for him. At first I was scared because he's romantically reserved, and it took me a really long time before he agreed to go on a date with him. Also, pro tip: never go on dates in Brindleton Bay. I don't know why but it's always raining there, which kind of ruined our date in this case since we were supposed to go stargazing. The night didn't end that badly however, since we just went around walking by the docks where we shared our first kiss. Now that it's clear that we both have feelings for each other, this domestic thing just made our relationship even stronger. I haven't made anything official yet because I wanted it to be really special, and also because we have both been very busy with university that we never got the chance to go on another date. I also noticed that he has been coming home less and less lately, often giving out the reason that he has a meeting with the Brainiacs.

That's why I started saving up for this vacation in Mt. Komorebi where I'll finally ask him to be my partner. For that, I had to do a few odd jobs here and there including one where I have to work with this Emit Relevart dude. Anyways, I went to the local library to read up on how to create this time machine when I suddenly saw him flirting with a very pregnant Ava Harjo! I was so ready to confront him but I decided to withhold judgment for now and see what he's gonna do next. They were being very secretive, whispering in each other's ears and laughing. I was beyond furious at this point so I went home and took a cold shower to calm myself down. At this point, I don't know what to do. Initially, I just wanted to let him off easy by kicking him out of the apartment, but lately I keep having these intrusive thoughts of stealing the unborn child to be used for experimentation or perhaps sell it to a vampire as food. I don't know though, so please tell me what you guys think. ",3,1739631588.0,AITASims,0,1.0,False

Due to heavy snowfall in the city, parking has been a nightmare, especially with huge, hard snowbanks. So, I parked on Roncesvalles Street early in the morning, where it’s usually quiet. I parked as close as I could to the snowbank and paid for parking, planning to grab a quick coffee at the shop. 

I was inside for maybe 45 seconds to 1 minute max, and when I looked out, I noticed the streetcar had stopped. Turns out, my side mirror was slightly blocking it. I immediately went out to move my car, and the streetcar driver told me not to worry, that he called the police and was giving me a parking ticket. I apologized and explained that I parked as close as possible and didn’t realize my mirror was blocking. He said it didn’t matter and the cops were coming to tow it. 

I apologized again, moved my car, and went on with my day. Now, I’m not sure if he took a picture of my license plate, but can the ticket still be enforced? It was literally only 45 seconds to a minute.

1iq33ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCroommates/comments/1iq33ep/april_1_movein/,april 1 move-in!,"Hi all :)

I am looking for someone to look for a 2bd/1ba in Manhattan for a late March/April 1 move-in date with me.  


***Some things abt me!***

* 24F, I am a civil engineer and work in the office in Midtown 5 days a week. I am originally from Maine and went to college in California.
* I am very outgoing and social! I love to host and make new friends, I would love for us to be friends. I moved to the city a year about and I already have a lot of friends and live a very busy life! 
* I am very type-A, I don't like clutter and I love to clean, love interior design and want our apartment to feel homey. 
* I am vegan, I love to bake and cook, and sharing food is a love language of mine :)
* Some hobbies of mine are; reading, going outttt, going to concerts, eating at vegan restaurants around the city, traveling (been to 13 countries), hot yoga, walking, fashionnnnnn, movies (loving 80s and 90s movies), thrifting! (95% of my closet is thrifted), environmentally conscious (I want to start composting at home)
* PS: I love animals but am allergic to cats unfortunately, so not cats at home :( and I would like to stay under 2k (ideally less) 

***My ideal roommate would be:***

* someone who is easy-going but also very clean and type-A (ish) who wants to decorate an apartment to feel like home, host dinner parties, brunch, etc.
* someone who doesn't cook or eat a ton of fish/meat, would want to possibly cook together (and saving $$ on groceries)
*  someone who likes a balance of going-out and staying in! who is happy to be living together and respectful of each other

I am looking for apartments primarily on the *UWS*, but open to *UES*, *EV, LES, Midtown*, anywhere we can find a cute place! Big closets are a must because I have a ton of clothes. I also have a decent amount of furniture already so we won't be starting from scratch!

If we sound like a match, I would love to meet for coffee! ",2,1739631505.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

To set this all up, I’d like to mention the fact that recently our consumption of sweets has been rather high and the day before Valentine’s Day I had mentioned to her something along the lines of “yeah our sugar intakes been crazy we really gotta cut back” she sorta took this as maybe some subtle hint as to not get anything for Valentine’s Day like chocolates or something. For some more context, she’s Korean and Valentine’s Day is primarily suppose to be the girl giving the guy some chocolates or flowers and there’s a separate day a month later called “white day” where the guy reciprocates. My comment seems to have spoiled her plan and made things a bit awkward that day and she finally told me about the situation and I think I made it even worse by telling her that of course I was going to get her something. This sorta led into her general perception towards gifts and that she feels slightly burdened to receive gifts not on holidays, so at random. She came out and told me that she feels like our relationship (financial) is transactional on her end. She really calculates our spending towards each other and feels like if I take her out she needs to repay me (e.g. multiple smaller things like a few coffee dates). Never knew she felt like this and it’s definitely something I need to put time into thinking how to lessen that burden but not the main part of this post. So now onto Valentine’s Day, I met her at her place to be surprised by flower..!?!?! We had both agreed the day prior to not get each other ANYTHING to avoid any awkward burden feeling or situation. I mean now I completely terrible and like a total ass. She even came out and said she does mind that I didn’t giver her anything but she knows she has no right to feel so due to our talk and agreement. I mean, then why even say that to me?? It just made me feel terrible that I couldn’t make her feel special or loved. This led to an awkward dinner and I wasn’t very inclined to make the situation feel better since she extensively told me how much burden she gets from some of these gifts and that let’s not do anything gift exchange on Valentine’s Day besides enjoying a nice meal out. Admittedly I could have problem solved the situation in real time to prevent further issues but I really felt stubborn and didn’t want to. So naturally, it snowballed. Leading to her saying were not a good match and that she might have finally reached a limitation and that she doesn’t know if we should be together. Tried my best to talk it out and it really took hours to get anywhere and finally come to a peaceful conclusion to keep the relationship going. Basically said I would try to find ways to lessen her burden or make her feel more comfortable but I’m really concerned with the difference in efforts coming from us. I truly want to make things work out between us but I also want to not feel like even in situations like these it’s seems to be solely my responsibility to make the situation better. Do I always have to be a bigger person lol. Just seems so hypocritical from their end but it’s somehow not alright for me to act in that way. Idk..

1iq2ynk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1iq2ynk/theyre_at_an_anime_convention_right_now/,They're at an anime convention right now,"I need support really badly right now. 

I wish there was an in person support group I could go to but even if there were I couldn't get to it because I don't drive, I'm physically disabled so I can't walk far, and I'm currently very isolated in the suburbs. 

So here I am and I guess I'll dive in. 😣

The person that tried to kill me is at one of the biggest anime conventions in the country, roaming free and presumably having a good time connecting with others, pretending that they didn't abuse their partner (my friend) for years and didn't try to kill me last year when I stood up to them.  

I'm not ok. I'm not ok that these people just get away with it and can move about the world to find and hurt even more people. 

This person is extremely mentally unstable and should be in jail or at least a treatment facility but the cops said ""there wasn't enough evidence"".
 The cops even discouraged me enough that I didn't get a restraining order because they were probably right that I couldn't get one. Maybe. Or they were just being lazy. I wish I knew but ultimately it doesn't matter because it's too late now. 

I've been living in this house, the new person that needed somewhere safe to go to after leaving another unsafe place, triggered every single day since things started going badly just a few weeks in; when their mask dropped. 

They tried to kill me in September.

Eventually they were kicked out. Unfortunately it took my friend and our other roommate a while to do it so I was in a constant panicked state for a month and my blood pressure was through the roof because my blood pressure meds were out. My friend was dissociating so hard that he kept not getting me to a Dr. I assume because he had no idea how much time was passing. I also started fawning/gaslighting myself, thinking I was just being dumb, and didn't really need my blood pressure meds. Obviously not true, blood pressure meds are no joke. 
When we did eventually get to the Dr my blood pressure was so high that they said that I was very lucky I didn't have a heart attack or stroke. 🫠

I'm in the first stages of heart failure because of that month without my meds and can no longer have caffeine (I know, first world problem)...which kills me because I love tea and coffee. Non caffeinated just isn't the same.😮‍💨

I'm not okay. There's so much else going on that makes me not ok but this is the biggest thing going on right at this moment and I didn't want to do a gigantic post discussing my thoughts on life in general. 😞

I even tried months ago to alert the convention staff and asked this person to be banned but they said they couldn't. I have evidence, the police report and everything. I told con staff that. Even though the cops didn't do anything, the report still exists. Con staff said they'd reach out to the hotel security but they never got back to me. 

I hate this. I hate all of it. I don't know how to be okay. The people I live with right now, I'm relying on them for shelter, food, I'm financially dependent on them while I'm recovering both mentally and physically. They aren't the most awful people, there's good points about them, but they are very unhealthy and definitely are making it very hard for me to be okay. 

Their friend group is also extremely unhealthy. They've known for years that my friend's now ex was terrible but none of them said a word to him that he should break it off. I had no idea what I was landing in when I sent out an S.O.S. for a safe place to go but this has been so, so very bad. 

I don't want to be here. I don't want to be around any of these people but I'm in the middle of a conservative suburb, I'm very not conservative, I can't get into the city because I am not financially or physically able, and I'm miserable. I'm so, so alone and I daily fight with myself to not just end it all. 

I have stress nightmares almost every night and panic attacks that wake me up. Not about this, the people I live with are definitely triggering in their own ways, but I know I'm extra activated by this convention because it brings up this person further in my mind. 

I didn't end up going, no money to do it and I'm still recovering from a major surgery (unrelated to the person that tried to kill me), but if/when I do go back to this convention next year... How much shittalking will this person have done to completely smear mine and my friends' names to the point where we won't even be able to enjoy participating with any events at the con.

Like, I really want to try my hand at competing with a cosplay. I work so hard on them, I've been cosplaying for 20+ years, and I'm finally like ""you know what yeah! I wanna get up on stage and show off a little maybe!"" But if they've already made everyone think I'm some sort of terrible person and they're the ""uwu widdle victim"" ...will I actually be safe? I've seen how easily people fall into mob mentality time and time again and all it takes is one ""crazy"" that admires this person, wanting to hurt me physically or online, to garner favor with them or something. 

I'm having a lot of feelings I know nothing of what to do with. I've been alive long enough to know that there's good and bad people but societally it's built so that we're never really going to be okay in the face of a determined, loud abuser and their flying monkeys.

My mom was the American traditional hard working stay at home mom and my dad the always working construction worker trying to keep a roof over our heads dad . 

I did not see my dad much and when I did he was generally in a tired and foul mood . As an adult I understand why but as a child I did my best not to upset him. 

I did not spend much time with him and when I did it was generally to do something he wanted to do . Baseball, roller skating, tennis and eventually riding bikes while he road his unicycle.

I dont know why my dad road his unicycle or why he learned st all. It really did not suit his masculine personality but he did. 

At a certain age, I became interested and after falling off my dad’s unicycle a few to many times he bought me my own. 

When he did I cried and cried and told him I did not want it . I knew money was scarce and because of that I did not want the obligations to learn. Mostly I was afraid of how my dad would feel towards me if he spent that money and I failed to accomplish the task. 

Looking back, it’s sad to think about the the things kids understand and the unspoken rules of the house.

However, I would eventually learn. Sure it took a while and during the course of those few weeks and perhaps a month I acquired my fair share of bumps and bruises. To the point that my school prinicpal asked me if everything was ok at home. I guess they also knew my father’s temper .But sure enough one day I would ride my unicycle to school and put the school admin and staff at ease. 

I road that unicycle for years and years . It kind of became my niche in the neighborhood and something I became known for. I even rode it in the school play :)

However, some where in middle school or at thr start of puberty I put it to the side and eventually it just became a little piece of rust that was placed outside .

Now to fast forward more than three decades I was leaving work and what did I see but a little boy riding a unicycle. Being one of my science students I walked over to talk to him and inquire about his talent.

He eventually handed me the unicycle to see if I could ride. Not telling him my previous talents , I adjusted the seat and took it for a short spin. 

On my first attempt I barely got a foot before hoping off but on my second attempt all the sparks in my brain fired and muscle memory took over and I was off.

There I was this adult man pedaling and balancing for my dear life. Heart pounding and fears of falling down in front of my student causing blood to pump at a level I have not felt in years . 

But I was a doing it, I was riding it and while I did all the memories of a small poor child came rushing back to me. It was more exciting to me than riding a rollercoaster but also sad. 

Sad for the loss of my talent and sad for thr little boy I used to be. 

On the way home i reflected of all the lessons I learned on the single wheel. I also thought of my student and how his life might be and the small connection between us. 

However, today on this Saturday morning, I am contemplating picking up my old hobby again. At my age I might break a bone or seriously injure myself but still the thought is there. 

Perhaps I am missing my youth or perhaps I am missing my fathers approval or perhaps I am missing the dreams that I once had on that single wheel . What ever the case, these are the thoughts on this early morning. ",2,1739631078.0,stories,0,1.0,False

“Whatever.” I answer when you ask me what I want for breakfast. That’s not me. I’m not like this. I never, ever used to be like this.

Or the feeling of your hard cock pressed up behind me, feeling you kiss my neck down my shoulder. I’d wake up to a gentle fucking with a little smile on my face. 

Instead, now you put your arm around me for a quick cuddle and ask me what I’d like for breakfast.

So there she met a guy and they clicked and they went out after the photoshoot to eat smth just them (even though there were other team membersand modal). 

So went to get food like 10 kms further, (also she didn't have her jacket on so he offered her jacket to her just being a gentleman) from where the shoot was and they stayed there till late like 9pm(shoot ended like 6pm) and he dropped her off at her place. 

She comes home and calls me all excited and tells me about her shoot and I even woke up early to hear all about it and tells be about the guy she met and thinks that he knows people and would be very useful to keep in touch with. And then tells me that she feels guilty because she said they had connections and she didn't think of me the whole time they were having good conversations, and said she haven't felt like this in a while. And I asked her ""if we weren't dating do you think something would have happened between you two tonight?"" She said ""Yes""...

I didn't know what to say but I said maybe try not to put yourself in the same situation again.

And bear in mind she still hasn't told him that she is in a relationship until this stage.


On Valentines day he messaged her asking her out today. Only then she said she is in relationship but still would like to go out if he wants.

Dealership is closed today because of 4th of July. I have no plans for today besides starting to house-hunt and start budgeting.

Yesterday half of the dealership was gone. Everyone took the day off to get drunk as shit. I had a bit of a conversation with \[Doe\] for the first time. I was filling up my water bottle at the water station and she was fiddling around with the printer next to me. She was struggling to remove one of the paper trays, and the new barista was behind me waiting in line for water. \[Doe\] knows limited English, and she asked me what error message the printer was displaying. Tray 1 of 2 had run out of paper. She had removed tray 2 and it had paper, but she couldn't open tray 1 and asked for help. I opened the tray without issue, and they were both in a wtf state, tray was empty. Barista joked \[Doe\] needs coffee and then despawned. I needed parts from the counter but nobody was there. I asked \[Doe\] if there's anyone at the counter, she said \[Jon\] was there. She went to ask for \[Jon\] and came back to continue fiddling with the printer. She went on a mini-rant on how much she hates printers, especially when she had to replace toner cartages for her dad's printer. She then asked if I planned on drinking tonight, then asked if I drink in the first place. I replied with: Well, I'm hungover right now. She laughed and said we guys are too much. \[Jon\] then shows up and helps me out. \[Doe\] now acknowledges me and includes me in her conversations when I come into the parts counter.

I think this is the lowest paycheck I'll be having this year. I only flagged 47.70 hours, so I'll be lucky if I get a $1,200 check. All the work I have been getting is pending approvals. I have 2 cars that can be fixed now. One is a GT53 with a leaking secondary radiator, and the other is the black GLC63 with leaking AIRMATIC lines. I had a GLC 300 Hybrid with a faulty compressor that I was going to finish yesterday. I removed the front bumper & replaced the front headlamps. Then \[Jon\] did the high-voltage power-down since I'm not certified to do so yet. I then replaced the electric A/C compressor, but the low-pressure line wasn't lining up. I then realize that the new compressor has a pulley and no electric port. It's the wrong compressor. I removed it & got the correct one ordered, should arrive Friday the latest. This car has been here for about 2 weeks and \[Jon\] had already told the customer the car was going to be ready today. Now \[Jon\] has to tell the customer that it will carry over for next week.

I mentioned it to \[Jon\] in the warranty office with \[Doe\] when I was getting more work. I sarcastically say, ""We all know \[Jon\] is a really calm and collected person, he'll handle this situation very well."" \[Doe\] then kept adding to the fire, but \[Jon\] put it to a stop. He said ""\[Doe\], I'm asking as a friend…"" He started explaining that he's actually been going to therapy for his anger issues, and that he is going through a lot right now. \[Doe\] then started getting defensive and played the victim, which came out of nowhere.

Towards the end of the day we were all huddled at \[Jon's\] bay. It was \[Jon\], \[Jon\], \[Jon\], \[Jon\], and I. \[Jon\] was talking about the weird comments that \[Doe\] has made in the past, and that today it kind of enforced that she's a little weird. \[Jon's\] phone started ringing, and \[Jon\] checked it out and said ""Oh, \[It's for you\]"". \[Jon\] looks at the phone and answers, pretending to be \[Jon\]. \[Jon\] was reminding \[Jon\] to clock back in from lunch. \[Jon\] responded with ""Oh, sorry boss. I forgot. It's because I am FUCKING STUPID!"". We all started dying of laugher for a good minute or so. 

Day ends, I go home and start drinking a bit. I mention in the group chat that I am hungry, but that I already feel like a fat fuck. \[Jon\] then DMs me asking if I really am hungry. We go back and forth beating around the bush whether we should go out. He did end up picking me up, and then we went to Texas Roadhouse to pick up \[Jon\] after his dinner with the police academy kids. \[Jon\] was with him but he wanted to go uptown; \[Jon\] didn't so he came with us. \[Jon\] and I were pretty hungry so we stopped by Whataburger. \[Jon\] shows us a dank meme:

\[Dank Meme\]

We then go to a gas station to buy beer & snacks. We go to \[Jon's\] house and drink at his back porch. I don't remember much about what we talked about, but towards the end we started getting philosophical, talking about consciousness and what happens after death, etc. Eventually \[Jon\] drops us off home at around 3am.

My house hunting journey will start today. I've rebuilt the \[Car's\] engine already, but the engine keeps overheating on me because of the very tight bearing clearance. I don’t want to dedicate more time to fixing cars on my free time, so I'm thinking of just buying my sister's car and start looking for houses. I'm barely in the process of really seeing how much house I can afford and setting a budget. I'll also be appraising my sister's car to see how much to give to my dad. I was going to make notes about it using this notebook, but I figured I'd write an entry since it's been close to a year without one. ",1,1739630834.0,u_5MeatTreat,0,1.0,False

How the concept works and what the police and city say about it.

February 14, 2025

Worms. Originally, a shisha bar was supposed to be built here. For months, the signs on shop windows and the outside facade advertised the ""combined shisha lounge""; the tenant at the time had announced evenings with live music and opening hours until 5 a.m. on weekends. The bar in Worms was supposed to open in October, but that never happened. Smoking is now allowed in the rooms of the former ""Rheingold"" pharmacy on the corner of Bahnhofstrasse and Wilhelm-Leuschner-Strasse. But not just water pipes. 

Here, on Bahnhofstrasse, Worms' first cannabis lounge has opened. Fabian Baig, a partner in the company, describes the location as ""super central"". In addition, there are many patients in Worms who consume medical marijuana. The ""House of Cannabis"" describes itself as a ""chill space for safe, legal medical marijuana"". The lettering on the outside facade and the style of the website are - like the fast food chain ""House of Döner"" - based on the Spanish Netflix series ""House of Money"". Cannabis can not only be smoked in the lounge, but can also be ordered. However, only with a medical prescription.

# Sale of cannabis only with a medical certificate in the “House of Cannabis”

To receive this, you must register on the website with your name, date of birth, email address and mobile number. You will then be redirected to the portal of the online pharmacy [docnow24.de](http://docnow24.de), where you can choose the type and amount of cannabis you want. Before you pay, however, you must provide medical information. **Medical cannabis can be prescribed for chronic pain, but also migraines and sleep disorders, among other things**. In order to rule out interactions, however, information must be provided about other medications you are taking; being under 21 years old or suffering from mental illnesses such as depression are also reasons for exclusion.Baig says that the pharmacy can deliver the order within half an hour - but of course only during opening hours. ""But it's just an additional option for our customers,"" he reports. Observations from the other branches in Heppenheim, Bensheim, Frankfurt, Neu-Isenburg, Offenbach and Mörfelden show that most customers bring their own cannabis.

# The “House of Cannabis” is classified as a smoking bar

The city's press office says that the business in question has a restaurant license from the city. This allows, among other things, the consumption of cannabis outdoors within the framework of the legal regulations. According to the police, the ""House of Cannabis"" is a smoking bar that distributes cannabis ordered from an online pharmacy on a doctor's prescription. This means that this does not constitute a criminal offense. However, the new lounge is not the only place in Worms where you can smoke a joint since the partial legalization of cannabis. [The ""Funzel"" pub behind the main train station hosts ""Doobie Thursday"" every two weeks](https://archive.ph/o/8pO4c/https://www.wormser-zeitung.de/lokales/worms/stadt-worms/in-der-funzel-in-worms-geht-der-griff-regelmaessig-zum-joint-4041080) , where people smoke together. Snacks are a must both there and in the ""House of Cannabis"": In the latter, not only snacks are for sale, but also cornflakes, soft drinks and coffee.

Open to everything.,"Hi, I am 30, single and I am looking for a marraige partner who wants Total control over her future husband

I won't mention about Kinks like some post do and this is because I believe that hard limits should be used as descipline and the rest for pleasure. I also feel that writing about the experience afterwards could help my partner understand things better. Besides, over time a kink that might be enjoyable to you might become boring and you might want to change things. Thus me being open to anything is the best option.

I also feel that if I am forced into something it would be better as this is the true form of submission and will teach me to put my wife's needs above mine and make me a better husband overall.

As a person, I am someone who takes risk and experiences new things even if I am afraid and FLR marriage where the husband cannot say no to any hard limits  certainly makes it a very scary yet, exciting relationship as the wife can implement any kink she wants to her hearts desire.

I could tell you stories of adventures outdoors with sharks, volcanoes and much more. Of course, once married I will NEVER  attempt to do anything crazy without permission. 

Why I prefer an FLR?  I have always dreamed of a marraige where the wife is 100% in control of everything and the husbands privileges of freedom are a gift from his wife. And the husbands only purpose in life is to love, be loyal, committed and serve his wife. 

How I came to understand that this is the right lifestyle for me?  Since I was teenager  I always had this desire to one day become a husband who will serve, yet, growing up in a strong Christian family the verse from the Bible ""wives submit to your husbands"" along with growing up in a country where men are either dominant  or equal in a relationship made me suppress any desires I had  and I never knew about FLR until one day when I was doing research for University paper and accidentally stumbled upon a blog on Blogger which intrigued me. Aftwards, over the years as I contemplated  while doing more and more research and reading other peoples stories I became  more and more intrigued to the point where I realised that this is the only lifestyle I want. 

However, the challenge is that most women don't want such a  husband and see men like that as 'Weak' 'no backbone' and prefer the Vanilla life that comes with arguments, fights and compromise instead of the freedom and full control that comes with FLR.

Service submission: I want to be the one who is solely responsible for all chores and also be responsible for cleaning up any mess you make and as a wife your duty is to relax or do whatever you like. This way you can come home, toss your shoes and clothes on the floor or wherever and not have to worry about it. Same goes for after eating, just leave the plate wherever and I will take it to kitchen and wash it. 

I understand that are some women like house chores and if your this type, its fine, I won't clean what you don't want me to. 

I also love acts of service where I perform the role of an assistant and butler on command. Imagine me carrying your bags, opening car doors, taking off your shoes and doing whatever you say where outside work your treated like a Queen.  I say outside work because in today's world its not realistic for two people to survive on a single income in many countries, but let's see how life goes.

When I deeply love someone, I become someone who is nervous, fearing I might unintentionally hurt their feelings. This makes me incredibly loyal and dedicated, to the point where I completely lose interest in other women. My focus narrows, and I can only recall the faces of women I encounter regularly, like family and colleagues. I also become very attached where I only think of the person I love and put her first in everything.

But for me it's all about love and passion, you love someone and are passionate about being more than just a husband and putting needs of the women I will love mine. 

Energetic and active: I am always full of energy despite my age of 30. I still go cycling, climb mountains, run and do much much more. Even after a whole day at work I am full of energy even at 12 midnight and their are days when I stay awake till 3AM just so that I will feel tired enough to fall asleep at 12 midnight the next day. I don't drink coffee or any stimulant. Just plain old water regularly or fruit juice sometimes.

As a person: I get along well with everyone regardless of nationality and stay out of trouble. Never had on issue in any of the countries I have travelled to and I find it easy to adjust to a new culture or country.  To be precise, it takes three weeks to completely settle down live in a country as if I have been living their for years.

I am also more like a gentlemen who is kind, polite and does not get angry as I suffer from headaches if I do. But just because, I am like a gentlemen,  you don't have to be like a lady. You can be rude, short tempered and use the F word as much as you like and call me whatever you like. But if I ever lose my temper or am rude, desrespect you or  use the F word then you can just descipline me. This is because I want you to be comfortable and just know your free to do whatever you like to me. 

WIFE CAN DO ANYTHING SHE WANTS BUT THE HUSBAND CAN ONLY DO WHAT HE IS ALLOWED TO 

I have travelled to different countries and had an opportunity to go to places that are normally restricted to the public due to my job and experienced so many things and continue to have some amazing experiences.

With my present job, I get to attend high class events where the best food, music and sometimes get to see celebrities perform in one of the most iconic cities in the world. 

Sleeping: when it comes to sleeping I can fall asleep in a five star hotel or a even on a sleeping bag on a concrete floor. Recently I slept in the desert under the stars next to a camp fire and a week before on the beach at night.

I am also incredibly independent as I live alone and work in a foreign country with no family or anyone but everyday when I come back to my flat, I wish I had someone to serve and the same goes when I wake up. I hate living alone and having complete freedom to do whatever I want, when I want. I wish I had rules to read every day and follow and to know that my life belongs to my wife and must stay healthy for her.

Social Media: I hate using social media, but only post images so that I have something to show while I am looking for a partner. I just want to remove all the photos and keep it strictly for work and family. I also want to stop writing these kind of post and delete this account.

To make a wife led marriage easier one day, I already use a system that will make it easy for my future partner to easily take control and continue to refine it. This system will allow you to see everything live and make edits in real time. The best part is that if I make any changes you can see what edits I have made in the version history, so their is no way for me to cover up any mistakes I make. All you need is to install four apps; Google Sheets, Notes, Google Task and photos. Thats it.

Financial where you can decide what I am not allowed to buy and how much I am allowed to spend. I use a Google sheet to track every expense and this can be shared with you live. This will also allow you to highlight purchases I have made that your not happy with or write comments.

Using Google photos so that all images on my phone are automatically uploaded to the cloud where you can access from your phone anytime via the partner sharing. This also includes any images received from others on WhatsApp.

Google Task: I currently use Google Task to schedule any task I want to do, from laundry, to shopping or anything else that needs to be done and the same can be done in a marriage where the wife can write down task she wants me to do when we are both at work or away on the app which will appear on my phone screen and when I finish a task I can tick it off.

Google Calendar: Long term task that need to be done or to schedule events.

Youtube: See every video I have watched and searched for

Rules: Google Docs or Notes seems to be ideal. 

Breaking rules: any rules that are broken intentionally or unintentionally or anything I do wrong or is not upto your standard can be added by me (so you dont have to do the tedious work of typing it) into a Google sheet which will show the date, rule broken and reason. This way if we are busy and don't have the time to deal with it, you can have a judgement day, where I will be kneeling and you decide how I should be dealt with for each mistake and start implementing punishments as you see deem necessary. 

Location tracking:  wearing a smart tag or air tag so that you can track my location anywhere. 


Other things about me;

- Never married, single

- I have no siblings 

- Past relationships: one (a little bit of FLR, but not serious) and we never had sex

- Virgin: Yes, I am still a virgin at 30 because I strongly believe that my body belongs to the women I marry (does not matter if my future partner is not a Virgin, I will explain why I am okay with this in a private message). 

- No medical issues except that I do wear spectacles for a minor eye correction on one eye where I can still see clearly even without spectacles.

- Smoking Habits: None, I do not smoke or vape (completely fine if my partner smokes or vapes)

- Height: 5'8 (partners height does not matter)

- Alcohol: very rarely, (partners drinking habits don't matter) I have no problem being banned from ever touching alcohol, if my future partner does like me drinking.

- Native language I speak: English, but willing to learn any new language my partner speaks 

- Relocation: As long as I have someone I can love and care about, location does not matter as I have lived in different places in the world such as Jungles, Mountains, the coast where the beach was just 40 meters away to advanced developed cities.

- Friends: the friends I have now are all guys, I have no female friends but in an FLR I will only have female friends that my partner allows me to have, but as a wife you can have as many female and guys friends as you wish and hang out with them anytime. And if you decide that I should stay at home alone while your out I will do all the chores and complete any task you have given me. But if I want to hang with my friend's I will first ask your permission.

- Jealousy: if your someone who is very jealous in a relationship, you have nothing to worry about as I don't flirt with women and even if I see a beautiful women, I don't remember her face an hour later because in my mind she is not someone important to me. Recently, an incident happened where I met someone at an event and month later when I met her she said "" I remember you, you were at the..."" and I pretended by said ""oh yes..."" but to be honest I still don't remember who she was even through I later found a photo of our business meeting at the event. Its like my mind categorizes people by those who are important in my life and those who are not, but when it comes to names, I am able to remember them better. 

If we don't live in the same location at the moment we can be friends and keep in touch on Facebookor Instagram, althought it is on Facebook that I constantly roll out updates that are happening both in my personal and professional life. This way we can figure out how we make this work and as soon as the opportunity presents itself we can meet, get married where I will be yours forever. Many people think thst distance is a problem but in reality it is not.

Please note. I am 100% serious about this and want this to be 24/7 lifestyle and I am willing to get married anytime. I have given this very serious thought over the years, done my research and understand very well what I am getting into.

I know I have not written much here but if you would like to get to know each other better send me a message and let's go from their where we can chat have voice and even video calls as we get to know each other better.",2,1739630408.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

I wanted to mention a few things which I feel are under-discussed which I have found to be important in my healing.



I am 31. I discovered corn at age 8 & have been addicted my whole life except for a 5 year period when I was in a good relationship in my early 20's.



WARNING # 1)

DON'T DO CHEM SEX or use drugs to amplify dopaminergic activities - including gym.

I smoked THC + poppers + caffeine & would have threesome marathon sex while watching corn. For months. You will just time travel forward into the future in a haze. I barely have memories of this. It warped my sexual tastes. I ended up dating trans ""girl"" (I am straight) & got sucked into a sexually loose world. The devil is beautiful. The memories & subconscious impressions come at great cost.



WARNING # 2)

DON'T VAPE THC & WORKOUT even though it's awesome (if you're gonna do it, 60/40 sativa/indica strains are best...). This habit ruined my life, & melted my brain.

Sophomore Year of college got into bodybuilding because I liked getting high off DMAA / Ephedrine in old C4 pre-workout product. Discovered hedonistic pump chasing. At age 29, I smoked cannabis for the first time and decided to try it pre-workout. It's awesome, but I am powerless to stop. Once I start, I'm high 24/7 until my supply runs out. It melted my brain, dopamine, subconscious, etc.



WARNING # 3)

Material success (including looks maxing) is meaningless. I graduated top of my class, have the body of a Greek god, lead every team I worked with (I'm a programmer), & was a millionaire by age 27 (I made & lost fortunes twice - lost most of it), but have been suicidal for most of my life, excepting some good years. Severely. I almost killed myself many times, including most recently, but a synchronicity (phone call telling me my brother was expecting his first kid) stopped me milliseconds before I pulled the trigger. I'm now trying to believe in God.



WARNING #4)

The ""whatever it takes mindset"" (engendered through extreme things like bodybuilding or high caliber success) is a double edged sword and carries with it unique risks. When we think of things like discipline, we often only think about avoiding bad stuff; we neglect moderating good behaviors. Limiting positive behaviors is necessary to build discipline & train the mind to obey. Don't say, ""I'm gonna study for 8 hours"" and then only study for 4. This will train a greedy & disobedient mind.



TIP #1)

Spend more time in silence. Fuck your phone. The pain of boredom is evidence that healing is taking place. Stimulation of the sense organs is a WAY bigger problem than I ever could have imagined. It is a primary root cause of a disturbed mind. Yoga says that vital life force energy (Veerya) leaks through the sense organs (Indriyas). Pay attention to how you feel after consuming ANYTHING. I don't allow my eyeballs to gaze upon ANY scrollable menu, and this has helped - news feed, YouTube. I used to think that listening to educational podcasts was innocent, or listening to self-help type YouTube videos was innocent. It is not. More information won't help. You already know the answer. See the impulse that you have to seek outside of yourself for something that lies within. That impulse is a lie and it isn't you. Become aware of things that stimulate the nervous system (thinking, reading, consuming, emotions, coffee, etc). Dopamine is the drug of all drugs, and it lies in subtle forms. Silence (and things like Yoga, meditation, prayer) train the subtle perceptions to gain awareness of the subtle costs of everything. Discover for yourself how destructive things are which are viewed as benign.



TIP #2)

I've been unemployed for 2 years now, and have SEVERE difficulty concentrating for interview prep. I can effortlessly do 5 hot yoga classes every day & can maintain an impeccable diet but can go for months dumping my clean clothes on the ground in my room, unable to clean it. Recently, I looked at my bank account for the first time in 2 years to see how much cash is left. I have had chores I tell myself I need to do, daily, which I haven't been able to do in the last 2 years - like go to the USPS website and submit a change of address, cancel old gym membership I'm still paying for, change billing address on financial websites, etc.

Last November, I made it 3 weeks on monk mode + no fap, here's what finally helped me:

I tell the mind ""I am willing to waste an entire day. Day after day after day. What is permitted is sleeping, eating, studying, or meditating. That's it. Productivity be damned."" Be willing to waste the whole day if that's what it takes. Eventually, the mind will fall in line. This technique of strong tyranny helped me get my first bit of success.



TIP #3)

In the difficult acute phase of quitting drugs & PMO, Ibuprofen helped me with the depression / withdrawal symptoms (could be the Interleukin-6 receptor, idk). Don't take it just to feel better - use it so that you can take the next step in your plan. It gives me 90 minutes of relief which can be applied towards doing the next useful thing - I use it to get out of bed, get into the cold shower, get liquid food in me, get sun exposure, etc. Helps with the suicidality.



TIP #4)

As a severe insomniac (hot feet, restless leg syndrome - goes on for 4+ hours all the time; it's miserable), here are some things that help. Remember the misery of insomnia in the moment and use the misery in visualizations when functioning during the day. When it's time to force yourself up & into the sun in the morning & you don't want to, visualize the misery of laying in bed awake and ask yourself what's worse.



TIP #5)

Momentum / a taste of success begets hope. My \~3 weeks of success during my last run (in November) was the first experience in my adult life of alleviation from my suicidal symptoms. Clinging to this experience has been making subsequent progress much easier.



OBSERVATION #1)

Running from hell (negative emotion; avoiding PMO) won't get you to heaven (positive emotion; highest ideal). From age 21 - 25, I dated & lived with a women who was 20 years older than me. We had sex daily, my circadian rhythm was stable, and my domestic life was analgesic for tolerating my unpleasant career. I was pretty happy. I probably rarely, if ever, did PMO during that 5 year period. 2 years ago, my best friend died unexpectedly at age 37 and I realized immediately that he was the only source of positive emotion in my life. That + quitting my job was the beginning of a decline.

I don't know the answer to how to get to heaven; I'm working on this. But I have seen enough in life to understand that heaven & hell are two separate axes.",1,1739630347.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False

If it's more of a social group like a coffee group or going to a bar when I feel more at home because I go frequently, then I can enjoy those. I enjoy reading, cooking, and working puzzles by myself at home and hanging out with my dogs. More than anything I'd like to be able to enjoy other groups, but there's too much self-consciousness and too much self-judgment. I'm envious of people who are able to do these things and simply enjoy themselves. I've made myself try all kinds of different groups and activities like this, but I have never enjoyed any of them, and I don't see this ever changing so I don't see any use in continuing to do things like this.

“Yup,” I nodded, “the doctor confirmed it if that helps.”

“Good enough for me, if you turn into a stargazer it’s on you,” he shrugged, motioning to a map of what I assumed was the surrounding area on a nearby table. The scouts, with the most dangerous job were rewarded as such, having what had once been a nice hotel all to themselves. It was on the outskirts of the small walled town, meaning no one else wanted to live there. It gave them a large parking lot for the various vehicles they used to scour the region, plenty of rooms to live in, a built in kitchen and plenty of meeting rooms for briefings like the one I was now attending.

“We have a convoy heading out in the morning,” the scout commander explained, “their ultimate destination is another safe zone south of Redmond, us scouts will escort them to the highway after which we’ll break off to scout for supplies. You, Traveler, will be going to an elementary school in the hills. It was a FEMA site early in the phage, before we understood everything. That means there’s thousands of stargazers there, but also potentially useful equipment.

“It’s too dangerous for any of us non-immune to go in, a single mistake could result in infection, but you don’t have to deal with that,” he continued, pointing at the map, “The other issue is crazies, there shouldn’t be any currently in the school but, as I’m sure you know, it’s hard to tell what could cause them to change.”

“Why not put a few teams of snipers on the hills and pick the stargazers off one at a time?” I asked, “might not be fast but seems like you could clear out most of them that way.”

“They tried something like that out east, soon as they started firing fully half of the stargazers turned crazy.”

“I heard about that,” another scout spoke up, “proceeded to overrun a nearby safe zone if I remember correctly.”

“Most of them managed to evacuate, but ya,” the commander nodded, “you’ll have an overwatch team to warn you if they spot any crazies, but don’t expect any fire support.”

“What am I looking for? Food? Water?” I asked.

“No, all the food there has long since gone bad and you couldn’t carry enough out to really make a difference anyway. I mean, if you find a pallet of MREs and a jack to move it then we’ll take it, but that’s not your main goal. You’re looking for equipment, radios, water filters, computers, welding kits, power tools, anything that we can’t easily make here.”

“And vehicles,” the other scout, who I assumed to be the vice commander, “check the cars, trucks and FEMA jeeps, see if they’re in good condition and if they have fuel.”

“Right, that’s the other big thing, fuel. There should be a portable generator there, and therefore, fuel. Recon didn’t mention seeing a gas tanker in the parking lot, it’s possible they parked it in the gym or something but more likely there’s a large, wheeled tank somewhere. If you can find that and get it away from the stargazers that would be a big help.”

“Alright, complex equipment, vehicles and fuel. Anything else?” I asked.

“Beyond that, use your judgement,” the commander said, “intact clothing, shoes, weapons, scrap metal, ultimately we can use just about anything.”

“And booze,” one of the other scouts shouted, “if you spot some pre-phage booze, bring that back!”

“Not a bad idea,” admitted the commander, continuing on seeing my confusion, “booze is valuable, if nothing else we can trade it to other safe zones for supplies. Unless you have any other questions, you’re with team four, they’ll find you a room to sleep in. Convoy leaves at first light.”

I nodded, following his gesture towards my team, which turned out to only be three other guys, and introduced myself.

“So you’re the immune guy?” one of the scouts, who introduced himself as Boris asked, “can’t say I envy you, going into a school filled with stargazers.”

“Didn’t you hear, he volunteered for it,” Jim, the second member of the team said, elbowing Boris.

“If you want to die, don’t drag us down with you,” the third member, Eric, said.

“I don’t plan to die,” I replied dryly, “I’m tougher than I look.”

“Then you’re crazy, I wouldn’t go into one of those places if I was fucking superman,” Jim said with a shutter.

“Why not?”

“You haven’t heard the stories?” Jim asked, leaning forward.

“Don’t scare the noob with your ghost stories,” Boris said, glaring at Jim.

“Hey, he should know what he’s getting into,” Jim complained before turning back to me, “as I was saying, the stories are weird things happen when hundreds of stargazers gather in one place.”

“Like what?” I asked, eager for any clues though I heard Boris sigh loudly.

“Like that sometimes, very rarely, the stargazers will all sing and anyone who hears the song will become a stargazer,” Jim said in a hushed voice.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Boris nearly shouted, “if anyone who hears the song becomes a stargazer, then how did we hear about it?”

As they began to bicker I glanced at the Harmony, which was still hovering silently over my shoulder. It glanced at me but didn’t say anything, seeming to have the same thoughts as I did. I doubted this stargazer thing was related to the Harmony or any other harmonic entities, but I’d been surprised before. That being said, I didn’t think it likely, normally the main goal of any harmonic entities was to spread, not stare at the sky for months at a time. More importantly, I didn’t think the Composer had the ability or reason to implant a harmonic entity in humanity’s genetic code on a several hundred-thousand-year timer. It simply didn’t make sense.

More likely this was just some old story to explain why some teams went into a place and never came out, but the parallels were worrying.

From there Jim spent the rest of the evening trying to scare me with more and more outlandish stories, from how the stargazers were slowly melding into a single mega-entity to people going insane simply from being near masses of them. Other than the story of them singing none of the stories felt that important, so I simply enjoyed the nice dinner the scouts got before retiring to the hotel room that had been picked for me.

“Don’t suppose you can tell if the hyperspace bubble feels odd,” I asked the Harmony as I prepared for bed.

“Not really,” it said, “I can tell there is something there by a slight fuzz in how my waves propagate, but without you telling me it’s the result of some extra-spatial construct I’d just think it was because of dust or something. What about your new sensors? They tell you anything?”

“No, they’re mostly longer range, lower resolution versions of what I already had. I haven’t activated the hyperspace communications system, no need to advertise myself to whoever might be listening.”

“I agree, for the moment anyway,” it said, bobbing in what I’d learned was its way of nodding, “but we might want to try contacting someone, be it AI or Uplifted, at some point. This stargazer thing is likely their doing, so it might be helpful to speak with them.”

“I suppose,” I replied slowly, “dangerous to do so unless we know their reason for implanting the stargazer gene in the first place though.”

“I doubt we’re seeing the gene activate properly,” the Harmony said after a moment, “for all we know the phage messed with it in some way, perhaps only partly activating it. The true purpose could have been to cause all of humanity to look at certain points in the sky all at once so they could get a quick count. Or maybe it was simply the first stage of uplifting humanity. Or a test to overcome, could humanity discover and avoid this genetic mine. Or, and I sincerely hope it isn’t this one, it could be a weapon used by the creators of the ancient AIs, a kind of timebomb they implanted in species they were considering for uplifting. If something went wrong they just had to wait and eventually all the uplifted would be frozen in place.”

“And we just got unlucky that some bacteria phage managed to make the jump to humanity, and latch on to those genes specifically?” I asked.

“From what I understand of the multiple worlds theory, there are infinite worlds, so even the most unlikely things must happen in at least one of those worlds.”

“That’s not… exactly how it works, but it’s close enough,” I shrugged, laying down in the bed, “But a world in which that happens would be very low amplitude, approaching zero.”

“But it would exist.”

“In the same way all of your side-thoughts exist,” I said, “you think through overlapping sound waves right? Based on where they interfere constructively or destructively determines what thoughts carry on. That’s how the multiple worlds hypothesis works, different events, actions, and probabilities overlap and interfere either constructively or destructively, with every possible resultant waveform being its own world. A world like this, where something crazy like a phage jumping from bacteria to humans and happening to activate an artificial gene implanted by an ancient civilization would be extremely low would have to be very low amplitude. On the verge of vanishing entirely.”

“So like a lighthouse world?”

“Not really, the world won’t become a void world or anything. Honestly, I’m not sure what will happen to it… it can’t just disappear, if it were just a sound I’d say it would be assimilated by another sound, overwhelmed. But, obviously, that can’t happen to a world.”

“Why not?” the Harmony asked, “if worlds are just waveforms, then couldn’t it just fade out? Become a lighthouse world through sheer bad luck?”

“They aren’t just waveforms, they’re closer to light, both a physical thing and a wave. The wave could be cancelled out, but the physical thing is still there. Like I said, I don’t know.”

After a minute of silence I turned off the light and went to sleep, by now I was long used to having the Harmony floating over me as I slept. From what I understood it did something similar, but referred to it more as meditation, giving it a chance to sort out its mind.

The next day, after a quick breakfast of toast and coffee I followed the other three to a large truck we’d be using for the day. There was, barely, enough room for the four of us in the cramped cabin, but in the end Boris opted to sit in the back. Escorting the convoy was relatively uneventful, only having to stop once for the front guards to take out a stargazer that had wandered into the road. I was told that the stargazers occasionally moved around at night, not far and not all at once, but slowly they moved and for no apparent reason. The running theory was they preferred to be in groups, as those in large groups didn’t seem to move as much. Apparently the doctor thought they were doing so under orders from whatever alien overlords created them, but he was considered crazy for a reason.

“Alright, the school is through those trees, you should be able to see the parking lot,” Jim said as he pulled the truck to a stop, “we’re going to drive up to an overlook, don’t go into the school itself until we’re in position. There shouldn’t be any crazies but…”

“I’ll be careful,” I nodded, ensuring my radio was on and clipped to my belt as I hopped out of the truck. As they drove off I made my way into the parking lot and began picking through the vehicles. There were half a dozen stargazers, all clustered near the center of the lot presumably to see over the trees surrounding the school. This appeared to be the main lot for the school and it was packed, far more vehicles were here than it was designed to handle and getting one out around the others would be a job in itself. Getting their gas, however, would be much easier. I was able to pry open the tanks of a half dozen cars, confirming many of them had at least some fuel left, by the time Jim radioed me to say they were on the overlook and they didn’t see any movement.

I reported back with what I’d found about the fuel before moving into the school itself. It was an outdoor plan arrangement, with a row of classrooms that opened to a covered but not enclosed walkway. Each of the classrooms had been converted for other uses, typically what looked like bunks or possibly long-term care rooms. The FEMA cots and long dried blood contrasted starkly with the walls, which were still largely covered with fading art drawn in the rough, simple style of children. Other posters had been torn down or covered up, but not walls of crude art, as if to hide it would be sacrilegious.

The constant silence combined with the eerie contrast made me want to avoid the rooms, but I forced myself to check each one. Several still had bodies, long rotted to nothing, and I hoped none were those of children, but they were otherwise empty of life, anyone infect presumably going outside to see the stars or turning into crazies. The latter likely being the reason for the blood splatters and bodies.

In the third classroom I found an emergency medical cart with all kinds of potentially useful bits, Jim confirmed the paddles to shock someone out of cardiac arrest alone were valuable. Pushing the cart outside so I could grab it easily on the way out I continued down the rooms. When I reached the end of the building I found the playground, and the reason people avoided the school. Hundreds, if not thousands of people stood, all perfectly still, staring at the sky. They seemed to stand in every spot not covered by a tent or some other kind of debris. Swings, slides and climbing bars were all off to one side, while most of the area was taken up by what was once a sports field of some kind. It was hard to tell with the masses covering it all.

“That… is unsettling,” the Harmony said as we paused to look, and I could only nod in agreement. I’d intended to check the field next, but seeing the masses of unmoving people, I opted to check the gym instead. Being the largest indoor room, and next to what I figured was a staff parking lot, it had been used as a supply point. Pallets of rotten food or stagnant water filled most of it, forcing me to cover my mouth as I walked down the narrow open paths between row of pallets.

Most of it was useless, as the scout commander had said, long expired food and the like. But there were some promising things, like a pallet of blankets and tents. Jim agreed it could be useful, but wasn’t high priority. Near the back door of the gym, however, I found the big thing, a five-foot-tall plastic tank, half filled with fuel. The generator it was meant for was around back, one of the large, wheeled generators in army green that probably belonged to FEMA at one point.

I wrestled the tank onto a cart and carefully pushed it out to the road where the others could easily pick it up. Along with the medical cart and a handful of computers I’d found it was already a good haul. But, there was one more place to check.

Taking a deep breath I stepped out onto the playground, carefully picking my way through the stargazers. I made it to the tents, and immediately found a small portable radio. The kind one might use to listen to music on. The next tent had a pair of cellphones, and the third a laptop. I didn’t know if any of it was functional but Jim said they’d help regardless.

I’ll admit I twitched every time he came over the radio while I was picking through the yard, worried any noise might set off the mass of stargazers. Even the Harmony remained quiet, though it did ask me to get my weapon shard out and arm it, something I did happily.

“Traveler,” Jim’s voice came over the radio, causing me to jump, he’d been silent for the last few minutes I reached for the radio but the Harmony interrupted me.

“Traveler,” it said, drawing my attention up, I opened my mouth to say something but froze when I noticed that all of the stargazers were moving. Very slowly their heads turned in unison, tilting down until, all at once, their gazes landed on me. It felt like a physical force, their stares, freezing me in place, the sheer fear and wrongness of it rendering me unable to move. I could hear Jim speaking over the radio, but was unable to make out his words, my ears filled with the sound of my heart racing. I noticed the mouths of the furthest gazers moving, spreading like a wave across the field until all their voices hit me at once, perfectly timed so they overlapped in a single, momentous voice.

“Traveler,” they said as one, none of the spoke above a whisper, but the word hit me like a tidal wave, somehow synced up to account even for the speed of sound so the voice of the furthest one reached me at the same time as the one closest.

“You have yet to embrace the void,” they continued, “join us.”

God man, I am.. it's okay actually. The leak in my ceiling is annoying, yes. I keep waking up to a lot of things being wet, that should not be wet, but it's okay. This morning I put down a bigger bucket, to collect the water. I've cleaned my dishes already, and I am boiling water to make some Matcha. It's 9:03 and I woke up, idk, 15 minutes ago? I have been waking up very quickly lately. I only \*fully\* woke up once last night, after a dream I had of dying, being unable to breathe. Super uncomfortable, yeah. But falling asleep after that, after a pleasant conversation with a gloomy cat, I slept dreamlessly. It was beautiful.

I am kind of tired, but not as tired as I have been. Feeling dehydrated, though I drank so much water throughout the night I was up and using the washroom several times... maybe I am consuming too much sugar or salt. I am a little agitated and kind of giving up on the concept of being friendly despite not feeling it. I am preferring silence to interacting with people who are stressing me out. Politest way I can say that...

today. and uh, now. Plans for today and how I am feeling now...

Routine stuff. Breakfast soon, after this tea is brewed. I am not shoveling the roof..  spring is only a month away, right? I can survive a little water.. I am pretending I am not enraged and annoyed by the constant dripdripdripdripdrip and the splashing of water over all of my shit that happens every time I fall asleep and don't empty the bucket for 4 hours. It's okay though.. I have a bigger bucket now. I'm tracking food intake with Chatgpt and, it is confirmed, I am eating a massive excess of sugar.. I like some sweetness.

God, I want some sweetness...

I turned off my heater last night hoping it might slow down the leak but, it seems to have no effect. Whatever, okay.

Plans for today. I am trying to motivate myself to dedicate a lot of my excess time to art. I'm gonna use the video journal thing as an excuse to art - it's kind of cheating, a sort of multitasking, but let's get two birds stoned here. I remain sober.. amazing. Was fantasizing about a smoke, already, this morning though. The dream I had last night, dying of some kind of asthma attack, was too real though - and.. it's good incentive not to smoke. What a terrible way to die..

anyways, okay. I'm looking at the effects of consuming 5X the daily recommended sugar amount, and suddenly a lot of things are making sense.

|**Effect**|**Why It Happens**|**Severity**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Energy Crash**|Rapid blood sugar spike → Insulin spike → Sudden energy drop|🟡 Mild|
|**Increased Hunger**|High sugar = No lasting fullness → More cravings|🟡 Mild|
|**Irritability & Mood Swings**|Blood sugar instability affects neurotransmitters|🟠 Moderate|
|**Dehydration & Thirst**|Sugar pulls water from cells → Increased urination|🟠 Moderate|
|**Increased Heart Rate & Jitters**|Some people experience adrenaline-like effects|🟡 Mild|
|**Digestive Issues (Bloating, Gas, Diarrhea)**|Gut bacteria ferment excess sugar → Gas & bloating|🟠 Moderate|
|**Higher Blood Pressure (Temporarily)**|Excess sugar impacts circulation|🟠 Moderate|

FUN. I really like sugar too. Sugar and salt. Today's side goal I guess, is to consume less sugar, while still trying to reach my calorie goal of 3500\~ ish. This might explain why I am so tired too... probably.

other stuff... I swear there was more to note here. I've got pumpkin seeds and a massive amount of garlic, because of some vague ideas from people that my weightloss might be related to some kind of tapeworm , they're both supposed to be helpful in removing parasites.

I want to get a little exercise in today, I haven't done any serious cardio in a few days - just played some BeatSaber and did some stretches. I think my focus today should be on making some good healthy meals, and creating some art. I am kind of wanting to socialize more than is healthy maybe, I miss humanity a lot, and the past few days I have spent a lot of time with some idle chatter.. which is okay, it's good even, but I am maybe using it to procrastinate instead of having beneficial conversations. I want to, at least, avoid debates, and stressful chats. I just want some warmth and comfort, to give and provide such a thing, I don't need or want incredibly in-depth philosophical debates.

On the topic of teas tho

Matcha is really nice. Chamomile, is really nice. They're really nice for exact opposite reasons too, the first being very stimulating - but in a stable way, compared to coffee or energy drinks, I don't feel the jitters - the latter being fairly calming and relaxing. So I have a drink now, to wake up with, and another one for nighttime to try and sleep a little more calmly. I need to make a point of destressing before bed, I think, because the dreams I am having are honestly absolutely dreadful. I should maybe look into some lucid dreaming techniques again, but I am not sure how helpful that might be...

Okay, just a little ramble, following the morning routine. I feel a bit better now. I'm gonna go watch some youtube, catch up with news maybe, listen to some music, enjoy my tea and try and get breakfast together.

    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iq2i7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1iq2i7x/the_foreign_tongue_in_the_dark/,The Foreign Tongue in the Dark,"Back in my teenage years, I was sent to the Philippines for school and to reconnect with my culture. My mother arranged for me to stay with my aunts for a while. For context, my family is deeply religious—the kind that holds Bible studies, attends Sunday school, and never misses church. One of my aunts was a pastor who worked with missionaries from all over the world.

We lived in an American missionary campus filled with century-old buildings—offices, churches, and guest homes. Our house had once been an office before being converted into an apartment. The rooms were side by side, with walls that weren’t exactly soundproof.

My aunt was strict and forbade me from dating. Any romantic relationship was frowned upon until you were ""of age."" But, of course, I was secretly seeing a boy whose family lived on the floor above us. He was a pastor’s kid, and we were both a little rebellious. At night, when everyone was asleep, he would sneak downstairs, and we’d talk for hours through my window, whispering and flirting.

One particular night, I wanted to make sure my aunt was asleep before our usual secret rendezvous. I grabbed a glass and pressed it against the wall, listening for any signs of movement. Instead of silence, I heard murmurs—two distinct female voices engaged in conversation. Curious, I ditched the glass and pressed my ear directly against the wall.

This time, the voices were clearer—definitely two women talking. But something was off.

I couldn’t understand a single word.

I speak Tagalog fluently, and in our household, we spoke either Tagalog or English. But this… this was neither. The language was foreign, something I had never heard before. The sound of it sent a shiver through me. Even now, I can almost remember the way the vibrations felt through the wall. It reminded me of Latin—low, rhythmic, and eerie.

I kept listening, trying to make sense of it, but after a few minutes, I gave up. Feeling uneasy, I texted my boyfriend and told him to skip coming down that night. It just didn’t feel right.

Oh—one more thing.

This happened around 1 or 2 a.m.

The next morning, I went about my routine, had breakfast, and waited for my aunt to come out for her usual coffee. But she never did. Confused, I asked about her—only to be told that she had left for a conference the morning *before.*

She hadn’t been home the previous night.

I froze.

No one had been in that room.

Goosebumps prickled my skin as I replayed the voices in my head. Who—or *what*—had I been eavesdropping on?

To this day, I have no explanation. No idea what language it was, where the voices came from, or who they belonged to. And honestly?

1iq28ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iq28ug/reality_v20_part_1/,Reality v2.0 [Part 1],"I’m not sure how to start this. It’s funny, you spend all day with these thoughts shifting through your brain, but then the moment you set down to put them on paper, everything leaves you. Ok, I guess to keep it simple, I’ll start at the beginning. Or at least, what I think is the beginning. 



I’ll start with the first thing I can remember. It was the water…but also, it was the feeling surrounding it. It’s how all memories become, the dimensions of reality collapsing into bas-relief, a snapshot in time. As I sit here trying to think back as far as I can remember, I’m realizing that the totality of my life now belongs to me as a string of images and impressions pinned to a single fragile string stretching backwards into infinity, anchored perhaps in the heart of a star. 



The oldest picture that I can reach is the moment of my death. My legs are stretched out in front of me, and I’m wearing my favorite jeans, the ones with the hole pre-cut into the right knee in a gaudy attempt to look worn. The steering wheel is in front of me too, but my hands are floating several inches above it. Everything, I realize, is floating. I am suspended in the crystalline lattice of this moment like a chunk of meat in a jello mold. I am trapped in that weightless ticklish belly feeling of free-falling, and I will never get relief. I am forced to look in horror at the water rushing up to meet the windshield. And everything else, the smell of the hot coffee spilling across the passenger seat, the sound of rushing air mixed with a pathetic whining ripping itself from my throat, is congealing into a single impression in my mind. 



The next thing is fuzzier, less distinct. It’s funny, but the older you get, the more life you live, the more it seems like your brain stops pausing to take those snapshots. Everything from early times used to come at me fast, a staccato rhythm of memories as frantic as a paparazzi’s trigger finger. But now, everything is different. It feels like each new memory is a sacrifice. I once had a coworker (I least…I think he was a coworker? He might have been my Uncle, or..?) tell me that his mind was like so many penguins squeezing onto an iceberg; every time a new penguin jumped up, it pushed another one off. That is what life is like for me now, an endless exchange of penguins while I desperately clutch to the few things that once held meaning. But I’m getting distracted again.



The next thing. That was waking up in a hospital bed. I can remember the feel of the too-stiff industrial cotton under my fingertips, and the pounding in my head. The room was bright in that sanitized way that makes your breath catch. There was a man looming over me. He had crisp, clean professional clothing and a white jacket. He wore a kind smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. 



“Mrs. Hurrian? Emily?” he was asking. My head swam, I struggled to focus on his voice. The world was slipping from me like sand through my limp fingers.



“Do you know where you are right now?” he pushed.



I shook my head softly, tried to mouth the word “no” but no voice came.



“That’s ok. You’re in the hospital, Ruthford General” he offered. For a long moment he paused, seemingly searching my face for something…a sign of recognition? When he didn’t find what he was looking for, he continued.



“It’s Tuesday today. You’ve been asleep since you were brought in last Friday. You were in an accident, nearly drowned. Luckily someone spotted your vehicle and was able to get you here. You’re lucky to be alive.”



I shook my head numbly. His words were all there but I struggled to make meaning from them. All the components made sense: hospital, car, drowning; but I couldn’t piece them together, to lay them on the larger backdrop of my life. I realized with a start that I couldn’t remember who I was.



Evidently seeing the terror in my eyes, the young Doctor reached out to grab my hand where it lay numbly at my side.



“Hey, it’s ok. I’m sorry, I know that’s a lot to take in. For now, just know that you’re safe. You’ve got a long road ahead, but you’ll have support every step of the way.” 



I swallowed heavily and nodded, tears prickling at the corner of my vision. And that’s it, the little stage-play in my mind fades to black with the stabbing globus sensation rising high in my throat.



The next pieces are…better? Little photos of me, surrounded by friends and family. There are yellow carnations on the table beside my hospital bed. Someone said they were my favorite…from before? I think that makes sense, perhaps still does, I don’t know. Something yellow at least, chrysanthemums, because I liked the name?



It doesn’t matter. In the pictures I’m smiling, because I’ve gotten my memories back. At least, I *think* that’s what's happened. I can’t recall the memories themselves, I just know I had the *feeling* of remembering in those pictures. I remember the sensation of slipping back into my skin like falling into a warm bath, a balm for the previous soul-deep ache. But now I’m looking at the pictures again and I can see the outlines of the figures around me but the faces are blurred and…oh god, I can’t remember their faces, my own parent’s faces, oh my god…



No. This is why I’m doing this. I’m keeping a record here, something immutable, something to anchor myself to in this storm. Here, in this place, in this time, the internet is forever, right?



I’ve heard it said that one technique people will use when attempting to lucid dream is to write something on their hand. Throughout the day you must tell yourself to look at the word, read it and assure yourself that you’re still awake. In your dream, this should subconsciously prompt you to look at your hand, except you won’t be able to read it; this *supposedly* will make you aware of the dream and thus able to control it.



The trouble is, I *can* read in my dreams. It’s just that the words keep changing when I glance away from the page. So maybe, if I can list things as I know them to be true here, then if anything shifts, I can catch it and know? Or maybe control it, stop *it* from happening again. The next time something shifts, something is *wrong*, I’ll catch it faster and move on….or…at least know. But I’m getting ahead of myself again. 



So…the first time *it* happened was in that hospital too. I was laying in bed. I don’t know what time it was, but I can assume that it was late at night, because the normal raucous bustle of the hospital day had settled into the calm din of hospital night. The television hung in the corner was on, playing some infomercial for a set of spoons with huge holes in the center. The sound was muted, but for a moment I sat and watched as the announcer on TV made a big show of dipping them into soup, only for most of it to pour through the middle before he could bring it to his lips. Unperturbed, he continued trying again and again and again. Somewhere in the distance a man coughed, and a machine beeped, but to my tired brain it sounded more melodious than monotonous; if I focused, I thought I could pick out the tune of an icecream truck composed entirely from high-pitched IV alarm chir-chirrups. My hospital room had a window taking up most of the wall to my right. I tried to peer beyond it, but everything was black. No moon hung to catch the welded corners of skyscrapers, no headlights of cars reached their greedy fingers through the gloom, not so much as a phantom reflection from inside the hospital room itself. Just pure, inky black.



“I have to get out of here” I thought, and the terror was fast and ice-cold and unforgiving.



The first touch of my bare feet on the floor was torture. Weeks in a hospital bed with little sleep and even less food had left me weak. I remember the way the hospital gown clung to my pitiful frame as I stood, legs quaking beneath me, holding on to an IV pole for dear life. The burning in my legs was enough to almost make me give up, crawl back into bed and pretend this was just another bad dream. But it wasn’t. I knew that in the way that everyone just *knows*, right? Of course you know. And that window with its wrongness, and the way this room was just a bit too tall, the walls just a bit too white, light someone had constructed it based on how someone else described the idea of a room.



I forced myself forward, one foot and then another, all the while inching that IV pole forward on two wheels, terrified that it might slip out from under me at any moment. By the time I reached the door I was already exhausted, pale and sticky; the feel of my sweat sliding down my bare back made me shiver. But that was nothing compared to what lay just beyond that door.



It wasn’t just the room. This place, this entire hospital was wrong. Beyond my room’s door a single hallway stretched off into the distance. The walls canted at odd angles, coming together in seemingly impossible patterns, stretching here and thinning there as if reflected in a funhouse mirror. No lights were on, save for the single green “EXIT” sign that hung above the solitary door at the end of the hallway, its phosphorescent glow casting everything in sickly sharpness. With a grunt of effort I forced my protesting body forward. There were no other hospital rooms, but etched along the walls here and there I could make out the faint outline of a door frame. More than once I passed a picture frame hanging on the wall, but instead of some generic hospital art of a flower or a rainbow, the frames were empty. By the time I reached the end of the hall and stood in front of that door, my body was shaking so hard I worried that I might rattle my joints loose. 



The feeling of the cool metal bar of the exit under my fingers when I reached out to touch it felt like deliverance. And beyond the door? I could faintly hear what sounded like the happy chatter of voices, mixed with….industrial sounds? No, more like…a blender? I pressed the bar down, and as the door cracked open, the smell that rushed to greet me was a warm one, coffee and fresh bread. I fell more than pushed into it.



And all at once I was on the other side. And my bones didn’t ache, and my feet weren’t cramping in the cold. I was standing at my full height, and, I realized all at once, wearing my favorite blue jeans, the ones with the hole in the left knee. Above that, a warm auburn sweater, though I could only see pieces of it from behind the black apron slung around my neck. When I looked up, it was to the scene of a coffee shop. The room was warm, but something in the quality of the light beyond the windows revealed it to be a crisp fall day. The place was packed with customers, sitting at tables, pushed into little nooks around the edges, leaning against the counters with their drinks and purses and phones. 



“Did you find it?” came a voice to my right. It took me several long minutes to realize it was talking to me, something which evidently annoyed it.



“Hey, dude, wake up” it pressed. I turned to see a flustered brunette in a white tank top and jean shorts that were somehow both Mom-ish and far too taut.



“Did you find it?” she repeated, punctuating each word with a frantic glance behind her towards the, I presume, waiting customer.



“F-Find what?” I asked. My voice sounded foreign to my ears. 



“Emily, dear lord, what were you even doing back there?” she asked, heat rising in her eyes as the woman behind her sighed dramatically.



“Back there?” I ask. 



When I turned around I found a metal door with a small window set into it. Beyond the window, a completely ordinary storage room with rows of boxes pushed haphazardly onto its shelves. Completely, totally normal. An ordinary storeroom in an ordinary coffee shop on a complete ordinary fall day.



*Where am I?*



It wouldn’t be the first time I asked myself this question. ",3,1739628983.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1iq27yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1iq27yt/my_neighbor_has_had_their_christmas_tree_laying/,My neighbor has had their Christmas tree laying in their front yard since December 26th.,"They had a large live Christmas tree and after christmas proceeded to throw it directly out their front door and onto their lawn right in their front yard and it's been laying there ever since Christmas was over.

 Literally just a half dead Christmas tree laying directly in their front yard. It's still laying there halfway through February and I have no doubt it will lay there indefinitely. 

When we first moved here the same neighbor had a junky coffee table laying out by the trash can but the garbage people never did take it, it laid out there for almost two months. I finally got sick of looking at it and went over there and took it, sawed it up and put it in my trash can when they weren't home and I'm about to do the same thing with this damn Christmas tree. 

I've though about politely asking them if they need help getting rid of it, but seems as to how it's a mid 30s couple with a pickup truck, this is just a case of pure laziness. ",15,1739628907.0,neighborsfromhell,64,0.64,False
1iq27ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1iq27ik/cannabis_plant_basics_anatomy/,Cannabis Plant Basics & Anatomy,"Cannabis is a medicinal plant that is moving to the forefront of holistic health care solutions. The potent flowers have a long and prosperous history with civilizations throughout the world. From the roots to the flowers, many components offer therapeutic value, and each plant part serves a purpose in the cultivation process.

# Hemp vs. Cannabis

Some confusion exists with respect to these two classifications, but the difference lies in the concentration of THC within a given plant, with hemp containing 0.3 percent or less THC. Hemp and cannabis each have over 500 chemical compounds, including more than 125 phytocannabinoids such as THC and CBD. While cannabis is primarily used for medicinal and recreational purposes, hemp tends to be more industrially versatile and can be used in the production of various items such as paper, rope, and building materials. More recently, there are a growing number of beauty and self-care hemp products such as dietary supplements, skin products and makeup lines.

Observing the appearance of the two plants, the shapes and attributes also differ. Hemp grows taller (sometimes up to 20 feet), with thinner leaves that concentrate at the top of the plant. Cannabis on the other hand is stockier and more bushy, with broad leaves and buds that appears to have tiny hairs or crystals. Additionally, hemp can grow in a variety of climates, is hardier and requires less attention. Cannabis on the other hand, requires a carefully controlled environment that is warm with a humid atmosphere, in order to thrive.

# Male vs. Female vs. Hermaphrodite

Cannabis is a dioecious species which means it produces male and female plants. This genetic characteristic is rare in flowering plants, only 6% of angiosperms species share this [trait](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?s=n&v=2&id=105422). When cultivating cannabis for medicinal or recreational use, it is vital to use only female plants, as males will pollinate females causing them to produce seeds and thereby decrease their THC production. As such, the term “sensimilla” is used to refer to this process of using only unfertilized female plants in order to maintain a higher THC potency. Cultivators using seeds must learn to identify the plant’s sex early in their development to reduce accidental pollination, the key to which is watching the node’s development.

# Male Plant

Male plants produce seeds but no flowers. However, they do grow pollen sacs necessary for developing new cannabis strains. The male plant is identifiable by the tiny green eggs or pollen sacs.

# Female Plant

Female plants are seedless and contain calyxes that grow pistils. These quickly change from small pre-flowers to dense flowers in a few weeks.

# Hermaphrodite

A hermaphrodite is a plant with male and female reproductive parts. Cultivators treat these like pure males and remove them fast to prevent pollination.  

# Cannabis Plant Anatomy

There are several components of the cannabis plant. The function of each part of the plant and its relationship with the other parts of the plant is crucial to maintaining a healthy plant.

*Cola*: The cola is the central flower cluster where the flowers or buds of a female cannabis plant grow together tightly at the tip of the plant’s stem. The larger the cola, the more substantial effect the plant produces. The plant’s genetics determines this characteristic.

*Flower*: The flower is a distinct female component. These are fluffy or dense and grow in various shades of green, yellow, red, blue, and purple. Most flowers are teardrop in shape and are heavily coated in trichomes. Also referred to as buds, they are covered in hair-like pistils that attach to the bracts.

*Bract*: There are three types of leaves that surround the cannabis flowers. The smaller leaves that form around the reproductive cells are bracts.

*Sugar Leaves*: The sugar leaves are also small, like the bracts. However, they are found around the colas and appear to cup the flowers. These do not contain sugar. Instead, growers refer to them as sugar leaves because they make the flowers appear to sparkle. The sheen comes from the high concentration of trichomes coating the leaves.

*Fan Leaves*: The large leaves on the cannabis plant absorb the sun and are the powerhouse for photosynthesis. Many of these are trimmed as the plant grows, and they are discarded completely following the harvest.

*Pistil*: The pistil is part of the plant’s reproductive system. It contains a single ovule and has two stigmas: thin hairs that extend from the bract.

*Trichomes*: The factory of the cannabis plant exists within the trichomes. These minuscule mushroom-shaped outgrowths produce the 500-plus compounds found on the plant’s stalk, stems, and flowers. The trichomes are responsible for the almost wet appearance of cannabis flowers.

*Stem*: The stem is the main transport for the plant. It moves water and nutrients to the leaves and flowers. It also helps support the leaves and flowers.

*Node*: The node provides connection points between the stem and leaves. These cannot carry much weight, one or two leaves at the most. Nodes play an essential role in cannabis cultivation. They are where the male plant begins to grow pollen sacs and where the pistils begin to form on the female.

Node vs. Stem

# Indica vs. Sativa vs. Ruderalis vs. Hybrid

All three cannabis species look and act differently from one another, but the two most well-known subspecies are sativa and indica. A third variety that is not as well-studied or used is ruderalis.

Over the past 30 years, breeders have developed thousands of hybrids of the sativa and indica subspecies. Although there may exist a limited number of pure indica and sativa plants, the overwhelming majority are hybrids. For the most part, hybrids vary from 90 percent indica-dominant to 95 percent sativa-dominant and everything in-between. Each plant offers a difference in appearance and effect.

In the past, indica, sativa, and ruderalis also defined the effects of the flowers. However, experts believe there are other ways to classify the different subspecies. Between the extensive crossbreeding over the past few decades and new scientific information about the assortment of compounds and essential nutrients, the contents in the trichomes can offer a better and more detailed measurement of each strain’s effect.

# Sativa

The sativa is a tall plant with slender leaves that thrives in warm climates. The herb’s migration westward began in Thailand, Southern Africa, and Mexico, where high temperatures and substantial rainfall helped them flourish. When grown in these climate types, the plant grows to an average height of 12-18 feet. When compared to indica, sativa has longer, thinner leaves. Additionally, it has lighter and fluffier flowers, making it easier for its long stalk and stems to support them.

Sativa strains are beloved for their perceived ability to enhance activity, creativity, and sociability, but often lack the high CBD percentages of its indica counterpart. Some of the most popular sativa strains include:

*Sour Diesel:* Said to be an accidental cross between Chemdog 91 and Super Skunk, the strain smells like gasoline and produces dreamy, cerebral and fast-acting effects. Sour Diesel first became popular in the 1990s and has been considered legendary ever since.

*Maui Wowie*: Appearing in the 1960s, Maui Wowie was one of the first strains created with greatly increased THC content. Creating an energetic and creative high, this strain is associated with a strong case of the stereotypical munchies and a pleasant relaxing body sensation.

*Green Crack*: Unique in its potency, Green Crack creates a strong, buzzy high and was originally called ‘Cush” until it was re-named by musician Snoop Dogg. Considered an excellent wake and bake strain, Green Crack is purported to make mundane tasks more fun and interesting while creating a sharp sense of focus.

# Indica

Indica plants are hardier than sativa, growing shorter and much bushier with broad leaves. Indica plants can thrive in the summertime across most of Canada, and require much less space than sativa plants, making them a convenient choice for indoor growing. With origins in Central Asia, in countries such as Nepal, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Pakistan, indica strains are popularly believed to promote a more relaxing and tranquil effect than sativa, unwinding and calming the mind and body. Some of the most popular indica strains include:

*Purple Kush*: Emerging from Oakland, California, Purple Kush is a cross between two landrace strains, Hindu Kush and Afghani. Rather than stimulating hyperactive thoughts, this strain is more likely to create a sense of contentment and calm. Purple Kush was named a Top 10 Strain of All Time by High Times Magazine.

*Girl Scout Cookies*: This Cannabis Cup award winner is a combination of OG Kush and Durban Poison, Girl Scout Cookies (or GSC), has become a staple strain within the US and Canada. Frequently used for treating chronic pain and inflammation, GSC creates a euphoric feeling and provides a pleasant, tingling body sensation. Stimulating creativity, this strain passes through waves of silliness and introspection.

*Northern Lights*: perhaps one of the most popular strains of all time, Northern Lights is utilized across all user demographics, including medical patients and recreational consumers. Known as a ‘hit and quit strain’, Northern Lights is extremely strong and catapults users into a lazy, comfort-seeking mode that fuses with a sense of well-being and general happiness. The strain originated in Holland, and is believed to be a mix of two landrace building block strains, Thai and Afghani.

# Ruderalis

Ruderalis as a stand-alone strain is rare. However, it is starting to pop up more in hybrids available on the medicinal cannabis market. It is a hardy plant that can grow in one of the world’s most inhospitable climates—Siberia. Ruderalis is extremely stout and compact with thick stems and broad fan leaves, growing to a maximum of only about 20-25 inches tall.

This third subspecies is unique because it is auto-flowering, meaning that the cultivation cycle moves automatically from the vegetative growth stage to flowering after a specific number of days rather than based on its sun exposure. This has led to the development of strains such as Quick One, which was created around the idea that the plant transition to being harvest-ready as fast as possible.

In general, the ruderalis is less known than its indica and sativa counterparts because it is generally used to breed certain qualities into a particular cannabis species.  

# Landrace Strains

The word landrace refers to “[a variety of species that has distinctive characteristics arising from development and adaptation over time to conditions of a localized geographic region.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/landrace)” When referring to cannabis, a landrace strain represents the oldest known cannabis strains, ones that grew naturally in the wild and took on certain qualities based on their environment. For sativa strains, this would be in areas closer to the equator, whereas indica strains grew in more temperate mountainous regions. Landrace strains are the ancestors of the many cannabis types and hybrids seen today.

These landrace plants include:

*Durban Poison: Durban Poison is a pure African sativa identified in the 1970s by Ed Rosenthal. It was reproduced in Amsterdam and has been a popular cannabis strain since. Durban Poison often has about 15% THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) and produces a sweet flavor with citrus undertones and an earthy aroma.*

*Malawi: Malawi is a pure sativa flower originating from the Salima region of Malawi in southeast Africa with an earthy aroma. The warm climate cannabis has a long flowering time that can last for nearly four months. Laboratory analyses suggest it contains an average of 21% THC.*

*Kilimanjaro: The 100% sativa strain comes from the eastern side of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. History suggests it was popular in religious ceremonies among tribes. Kilimanjaro offers a fruity fragrance with lemony undertones and a citrus taste.*  

*Acapulco Gold: Acapulco Gold is a well-known sativa originating from the Acapulco, Mexico region of North America. Laboratory studies indicate it contains an average of 19% THC and produces a burnt toffee fragrance.*

*Lambs Bread: Also known as Lamb’s Breath, it is an original strain from Jamaica with a sweet and musky aroma. The Landrace gained popularity with the reggae duo Bob Marley and Peter Tosh.*

*Panama Red: Another well-known landrace strain is Panama Red, which, as the name suggests, originates from Panama. Panama Red provides an earthy fragrance. It saw a boost in mentions in the 1960s. The original strain is a pure sativa with an average growth rate that produces around 17% THC.*

*Punto Rojo: Punto Rojo is a South American sativa landrace strain that gained popularity in the 1970s. It offers a fruity taste and incense aroma. The rare flower’s THC level is unknown.*

*Colombian Gold: Columbian gold is a classic sativa landrace strain originating from the Santa Marta mountains in the South American country. It contains an average of 17% THC and provides a skunky fragrance with lemony lime undertones and a sweet taste.*

*Thai: Thai is a pure sativa cannabis strain originating in Thailand. The Southeast Asian flower generally ranges from 14% and 24% THC. It offers an earthy aroma with sweet undertones and an equally woody taste with a sweet and spicy aftertaste.*

*Chocolate: Also known as Chocolate Thai, it is another Thailand sativa landrace strain with a twist. It contains an average of 15% and offers a flavor and fragrance, a sweet blend of chocolate and coffee.*

*Afghani: As the name suggests, Afghani is a pure indica landrace native to the mountains of Afghanistan. Unlike other regions of the world where cannabis was prohibited before the 1940s, the Middle Eastern country did not end cultivation until 1937. Afghani contains an average of 21% THC and produces a skunky, diesel aroma with citrus undertones.*

*Mazar: Also known as Mazar I Sharif, it is another Afghanistan strain found in the Northern Afghanistan mountains. Mazar contains low levels of THC, about 13%. The pure indica landrace offers an earthy aroma with spicy undertones and a sweet and spicy taste with a lemon-pepper aftertaste.*

*Hindu Kush: The Hindu Kush is a pure indica landrace named for the harsh area it originates from, the mountain range between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Laboratory analyses show it contains around 18% THC on average and offers a sweet and earthy aroma.*

*Lashkar Gah: Lashkar Gah is a pure indica landrace strain that also originates from the Middle East. The flower averages between 11 and 13% THC and comes from Southern Afghanistan. It produces a spicy and earthy aroma and flavor.*

# Hybrid

Most strains available today are hybrids, a cross between two or more strains to create a new variety. Hybrids have features closely related to their dominant subspecies and are produced to achieve a particular effect, the best of both combined strains.

The beauty and complexity of the cannabis plant brings forward a lot of opportunities to learn and grow alongside them. Having basic knowledge of the plant is important for making the right decisions about what cannabis products or strains are right for you.Cannabis is a medicinal plant that is moving to the forefront of holistic health care solutions.
