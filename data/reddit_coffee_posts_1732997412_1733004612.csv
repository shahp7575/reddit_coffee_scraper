Let‚Äôs face it, if we‚Äôre going to stay on top of this, we need to stay innovative. It‚Äôs not just about following someone around anymore, it‚Äôs about the psychological game. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned, but I‚Äôd love to hear your insights.




1. **Synchronization is Key**  
   Anyone can tail someone in a car, but *synchronized actions* get in their head. Like opening an umbrella at the exact same time they do, or everyone coughing when they walk by. One time, our team coordinated a simultaneous ringtone in a coffee shop. Their face? Priceless.

2. **The Color Game**  
   Red shirts, blue hats, or even neon shoelaces. Pick a color code and make sure they see it everywhere. Bonus points if you switch it up suddenly‚Äîthey‚Äôll think they‚Äôve cracked the pattern and then BAM, you change it.

3. **Subtle Sounds**  
   We‚Äôre not talking airhorns here. Whispered phrases like, ‚ÄúWe know,‚Äù or jingling keys in their vicinity can work wonders. For pros, try using a dog whistle. Dogs react, they hear it, but they can‚Äôt explain it.

4. **Tech Tactics**  
   We all know about hacking into their Wi-Fi, but what about leaving subtle glitches? Adjust their screen brightness remotely or make their smart speaker answer unasked questions. It‚Äôs the little things that make them question reality.

5. **Fake Familiarity**  
   If you‚Äôre walking by, say their name or something personal like, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the new apartment?‚Äù even if you don‚Äôt know them. The goal is to make them feel like everyone‚Äôs in on it.

Should I try to work things out more?,"I 15F have been together with my medium distance boyfriend M17 for almost 7 months now and it‚Äôs been bumpy for us. We met online but we‚Äôve hung out irl before only a few times because my mom is strict and he lives about a hour away from me. When we first started dating he would talk about his ex a lot. Not about how she was as a person but how she had changed him which I didn‚Äôt think was weird until he showed that he still had her and her family‚Äôs stuff, art and I have now just found out videos and some pictures together. Of course he told me all of this with no hiding of it but I just felt a disconnection ever since the start of this. He‚Äôs only ever had 2 girlfriends before and he‚Äôs only been in love with one of them, the girl who‚Äôs stuff he still has. I‚Äôve never been officially together with someone I‚Äôve just had been in love with one guy before him. I only bring this up because I have barely talked about this guy to him. It‚Äôs funny, I actually was in the middle of telling him the full story of my first love and he made it into his story with his first love which then started an argument because he had used their song for OUR song. And that is also when I found out about the painting she gave him that he still had up on his wall, he then broke the painting in front of me and begged for me to stay with him. I should also add I am overly sensitive, not to actions but to an emotional point where every action you take has an underlying meaning to me so I‚Äôm just putting that out there for my perspective. I also have been feeling a bit overwhelmed recently about the girl, I just keep comparing myself to her because I‚Äôve seen pictures of her and she is really beautiful. She is a copy paste Latina and I‚Äôm Mexican also so it hurts to know she‚Äôs basically the better version of me. I memorized her face and I noticed our eyes look the same. I feel this is my problem though, like I‚Äôm just trying to find a reason to feel bad maybe? Being with my bf has made me gain some weight so I‚Äôve been feeling extra insecure about that too. He tells me I‚Äôm beautiful and that I‚Äôm perfect but whenever he compliments me now I can‚Äôt help but think of him saying it to her. They‚Äôve laid in bed and kissed and gone on coffee dates together while I‚Äôve done non of those with him or at all for that matter. He was my first kiss and he says he‚Äôs never had sex with her but I feel like he‚Äôs done something somewhat sexual with her since he doesn‚Äôt elaborate, he runs into her all the time now that we‚Äôve started dating. And his family doesn‚Äôt really show interest in me so I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. He recently has logged into their shared tik tok account and told me but I have no idea why he would need too? Like why go and see what has happened to your videos? What‚Äôs the point? Aren‚Äôt you dating me? This is a small portion of what I‚Äôm thinking someone please I need advice I really love him. He says the reason for logging into the account is because he wants to see if she still is logged in and what she did with the videos. AITA for wanting him to forget about her and focus on me? Or maybe I‚Äôm just not seeing the work he‚Äôs putting into us? ",0,1733004203.0,AITA_Relationships,0,0.5,False

Anything goes from ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else. 

I'm a working professional. Outside of work, I volunteer, exercise, visit local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, and read. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too üëª

Looking forward to reading from you.

1h3nks0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1h3nks0/the_creamer_dreamer/,The Creamer Dreamer,"I am in one of those strange, amorphous mindscapes that I so often encounter while dreaming: a mall or other large commercial location that becomes an entirely different scape with the turning of a corner or egress through a door. Ex: I‚Äôm wandering through a mall, turn a corner, then find that I am in the detached garage at my grandparent‚Äôs summer home in Goshen, NJ.

Anyway, in my dream last night, I found myself in one of the aforementioned and nebulously defined environments. This time, I am standing in the back of a church basement, making myself a cup of coffee. It‚Äôs clear that I am at a 12-Step meeting, with one person up at the front of the room, dressed in casual attire (white t-shirt with a design I either can‚Äôt remember or couldn‚Äôt make out and, I‚Äôm assuming, blue jeans), and telling their story of Experience, Strength, and Hope. Anyone who‚Äôs been to an AA meeting will know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. They may not even need to read the rest of the description of my environment to envision a location in which the coming events could take place. As is common for my dreams, I hear speech, but can only make sense of phrasal odds & ends‚Äîa word here, half a sentence there. The audience is rapt, hardly daring to blink or breathe for fear of interrupting the vocal spell being cast by the speaker.

I notice that there is an uncommon number of children among the crowd. There are sometimes one or two children, wreaking quiet havoc or playing games on tablets, but in this dream it appears as though as much as fifty percent have their children in tow. This in itself is not particularly alarming, just strange.

The coffee station in the dream AA meeting is no different from the dozens of others I‚Äôve encountered over the past few years. With its large steel electric coffee urn, stack of possibly the smallest Styrofoam cups allowed by Galactic law (roughly half the size of what most adult Americans would consider a normal cup size, and *always* Styrofoam), one of the foam cups filled with granulated sugar set into hard brown clumps as a result of people stirring their coffee with the ubiquitous plastic spoon then placing it immediately back into the sugar, all set atop a faux wood-grain folding table.

As previously mentioned, I am at the described coffee station, making myself a cup of usually surprisingly good coffee. (F.N.: I have theories as to just why it is that AA meetings typically have above subpar coffee, the most logical being that the coffee urns, receiving no more than a cursory rinse at the end of each meeting, have an effect on the flavor, just as the seasoning of a cast iron skillet or wok effects the flavor of the food cooked in it. But I digress. Again.)

I‚Äôve always been a cream and sugar person. That‚Äôs how I experienced coffee for the firt time, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve consumed it since, with the exception of a period of just a few weeks in my early thirties when I drank it black for no reason more significant than just wanting to try something differently. In my dream, I fill my cup with coffee, add a spoonful of sugar, then go to add some of the non-dairy creamer that‚Äôs usually available in one of the foam cups right next to the sugar. Only this time, instead of being filled with a reasonable amount of the whitish powder, it is overflowing, sitting in a pile of the stuff. The cup literally runneth over. For reasons I did not at the time, and still don‚Äôt, understand, I find that I am wary of this sight, as one may be wary of a stray dog. There is now not a spoon to be found on or about the table. I look behind the urn, under the table, in my pockets: nothing. But I know that \*simply must\* add creamer to my coffee. I have no choice in the matter. It must absolutely be done. Not adding creamer to this particular cup of coffee has, in the context of the dream, dire/unknown and therefore possibly life-threatening consequences.

Meanwhile, the bits & bobs I‚Äôve been hearing of the speaker‚Äôs story have ceased. A venomous silence has fallen over the room. I turn to investigate, to see what might have prompted this sudden silence, and find that everyone in the church basement is staring at me. Not just the adults; the children are watching, goggle-eyed, as well.A few among the populous whisper to one another while keeping their eyes firmly on me, sopeaking from the corners of their mouths. My anxiety rises several notches.

Although I don‚Äôt typically have Lucid Dreams, I become aware that it‚Äôs entirely possible that I may be in the midst of a classic Naked-in-Public dream, but when I look down, I am fully clothed. All the same, this does nothing to assuage the steadily mounting fear and trepidation building in my mind and heart. At this point, I can only assume that they are watching and waiting for me to/to see if or how I add the creamer to my coffee. Again, my anxiety increases. It hasn‚Äôt yet reached a point of criticality, though I can tell that that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs headed, based on past experience.

I turn back to the table, cup in hand, even though I distinctly remember leaving it on the table before turning to inspect the crowd. This time, there‚Äôs no creamer, non-dairy or otherwise, anywhere in sight. The table is entirely barren, save for a white plastic spoon set parallel to the length of the table. The sight of the empty table is somewhat relieving. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôve been absolved of my creamer-adding duties by some benign beverage-base deity. (F.N.: I have a memory of being told by my father one summer afternoon in my thirteenth or fourteenth year that I was to learn how to use the lawnmower the following morning. I spent the rest of that afternoon/evening in an anxious daze because, at the time, I had something of a phobia of gas-powered machinery. My relief the following morning when I woke up and saw that we were being hit by torrential rains was such that I can still recall that visceral sense of relief in decent detail. My point here is that I experienced a similar breed of relief upon discovering that the coffee creamer had gone missing that I felt back in ‚Äò99/‚Äô00 when the lawn mowing lesson had been delayed.)

This is where the serious surreality kicks off. Staring at the suddenly barren table, foam cup in hand, I feel a tug at the back of my shirt. I turn and see a little blonde girl in a blue and white checkered Little Debbie‚Ñ¢dress proffering a cardboard pint of Half&Half. Not an eye has wandered from me and my plight. My fear, anxiety, and relief are now melding into an odd pseudo-emotion I am at a complete loss to describe with any accuracy. I turn back to the table, set the cup down on the faux wood surface, twist off the half & half‚Äôs plastic cap, and pour a dollop into the black coffee. I reach for the spoon to stir it up. An angry male voice shouts, ‚Äú\*What the hell was THAT\*?‚Äù

I freeze.

An equally angry female voice then adds, ‚Äú\*Does this guy even know what he‚Äôs doing\*?‚Äù

Stasis intact, I second guess my actions. Did I do that correctly? What did I do wrong here?

More cries of contention arise from the ever watchful crowd, all voicing convictions to the effect that I‚Äôve added the creamer incorrectly and haven‚Äôt the foggiest clue as to what I‚Äôm doing. The amorphous pseudo-emotion transforms quickly into firm, unalloyed terror. I cannot speak, and therefore can‚Äôt counter the crowd‚Äôs arguments or defend myself. I look like an idiot. There‚Äôs no way I look like anything but a complete ineffectual moron. Confused and beginning to feel the cyclonic swirl of anxiety-induced disorientation, I do the only thing that seems to make any sense.I pour more half & half into my cup, an action met by some positive reactions from the crowd. Cries of ‚Äú\*There you go\*,‚Äù and, ‚Äú‚Äù\*Now we‚Äôre talkin‚Äô\*,‚Äù and the like emanate from the crowd like deconstructed atoms from a fissile core. When I stop pouring, the negative comments regarding my creamer-related aptitude resume. There is no no more than a quarter-inch of room left in the cup. If I add much more half & half, I won‚Äôt be able to pick up the cup without spilling it, but still the catcalling and ridicule come. The crowd begins to chant (F.N.: One thing I learned from this dream is that hearing large groups of people chanting, whether directed at me or not, prompts a serious phobic reaction in me), but there‚Äôs no uniformity in the act, as is the norm for chanting crowds; it sound as if there are different factions within the group calling out their own individual slogans, equating to a maelstrom of indeterminate vocalizations, none of which sound very encouraging. Or, at least, encouraging of anything that made sense to me. Imagine standing in the middle of a stadium filled with people who hate your guts. Each one of them is equipped with a megaphone and ceaselessly spouting personalized vitriol in unison. That is as accurate an approximation as I can convey without divulging (or \*indulging\*) vast quantities of abstract, nonsensical verbiage.

For some unknown span of characteristically elastic Dream Time, I absorb the barbs, the digs, the slings and arrows; my distressed perplexity mounts ever higher. In an attempt to quell the chaos, I begin pouring more creamer into the cup. Coffee and creamer run over the rim of the cup and onto the tabletop. Instantly, as if some Frankensteinian Lever has been pulled, the chiding ceases and become cheers, encouragement, applause, laughter. The AA attendees are losing their ever-loving minds. \*This\* is what they‚Äôve wanted from me the whole time, what they‚Äôve been waiting and watching for. I pour and pour, periodically looking over my shoulder at the ecstatic crowd. When the cardboard pint is empty, a man departs briefly from the crowd to clap me on the shoulder, congratulate me, and hand me another carton of creamer. I begin pouring this into the cup as well. The coffee has long since departed the cup, washed away by a tsunami of half & half, leaving behind only specter of pallid beige to evidence its one-time existence. The table and floor are now home to puddles of coffee-laced half & half. I empty a second carton, a third, a fifth (there is no fourth carton‚ÄîI go straight from number three to number five) all the while the crowd behind me cheers and shouts fervently in support of my actions. I was born for this, made to do this; generations have passed, awaiting my arrival. I am the Pourer of Creamer, a King by my Own Rite. The cosmos begins to deflate around me. I want to drop the creamer and run, but there is no stopping this foretold event. I must pour the creamer, I must not stop. The universe begins to speed up like a VHS tape on Fast-Forward, faster and faster until all that exists, has existed, or ever will exist becomes one uniform blur of light and life and pain and pleasure.

This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

It was not as hard as I anticipated, just lots of frogging both large and small as I miss stitches. It was a lot of fun following the visual pattern vs the non-visual , exclusively counting patterns like Amigurumi - I am so awful at those! I got to a point where I would reference the pattern, but once the base of the letters were set, I could work off of my piece and didn‚Äôt have to look at the pattern much. 

So many people seem to love Amigurumi and I have struggled so much I thought I may only be good at basic blankets and pot holders, but wanted something more challenging and artistic.

1h3nh68,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1h3nh68/working_a_full_time_job_acting/,Working a full time job + acting ,"Hi there! 

I keep on seeing posts about how to get a good job while acting, something full time with benefits, how to successfully live in LA, etc. and I wanted to share my experience in case it works for anyone. I‚Äôll go from the beginning to where I am now (a 2.5 year journey) so it may be long but I think it could be good insight. 

Feb 2022: decided I wanted to start acting 

May 2022: i got signed in Seattle and LA. I told my bosses I wanted to work remote for the summer (I was already part remote) but they fired me 

June 2022: went to Cali for the summer to take classes and audition. Lived with my dad and worked at a coffee shop. I was driving 200+ miles a week to LA from Orange County for acting class while making minimum wage and was so broke and so depressed. I actually hit rock bottom. I realized that there was no way I can be an actor without making an actual salary. I told myself I was going to take some time off acting, go back to Seattle at the end of the summer and look for a corporate job. 

October 2022: i got hired as an EA at a corporate company (that was remote from October to May) and didn‚Äôt audition for a couple months, was still taking classes, but wanted to really focus on getting good at my job. I was booking jobs, auditioning and my boss never knew. I would take PTO for gigs and just ensured I always did my best. 

October 2023: my boss found out I was an actor after he tried to find out what present to buy me for my 1 year, and a coworker told him to buy me lights for self tapes. He told me to never let my job get in the way of my creative endeavors and he supports me fully. This was a turning point for me. I told him I appreciated his support and planned on moving to LA in the new year, and wanted to stay with our team. I got a job I knew had offices in LA with the idea this would happen eventually and he told me he will discuss the possibility 

March 2024: i sat him down and told him i wanted to move, he said we could give it a try and i moved. I‚Äôve been in LA since, i have amazing reps, im auditioning like crazy, i have a real job with real money and can live my life. 

Nov 2024: im being put up for promotion at work, have been offered jobs based out of LA bc of my work reputation and can still focus on acting. My team isn‚Äôt here so i can leave anytime for in person auditions, work a flexible schedule to self tape and take time off when I book. I am so lucky and truly feel like I have the dream scenario

How did I do it? 

- i took time off acting, i knew if i wanted to be in this long term i really needed to focus on getting good at my job 
- i busted my ass at work, i did my best EVERYday bc i wanted to ensure he wanted to keep me when I wanted to move, that was key to having flexibility without my team here 
- work comes first. I‚Äôm not a series regular, I‚Äôm building my career and that takes time. The more money i have, the more i can pour into acting. So many people don‚Äôt want to work a full time job bc they will miss out on an opportunity - that is not the case, if it‚Äôs for you - you will NOT lose it 

Some caveats: 
- i started acting when I older, i was 25 and had a college degree, it was easier for me to land this job 
- i lived with my parents and was able to save a bunch of money 
- i got lucky with the best boss ever, he in himself is a blessing and i do realize thats rare 
- i have had luck with acting due to my type & personality (not trying to yank my chain - there are so many more people out there that are more talented than me, I just have something ppl like) 

I‚Äôm not trying to brag - it has been hard. I have hit rock bottom, wanted to quit, was so broke I was constantly borrowing money and it fucking sucked. I wanted this to work so bad I know I needed to hit the drawing board. 

Take some time off acting, find a career, make a plan, and invest in yourself. It takes time regardless, let that time pass while you are also pouring into yourself and your future.  ",1,1733003853.0,acting,2,0.67,False

The current owners, an elderly couple, started the business 6 months ago after converting it from a coffee shop. They now want to sell due to health and age-related reasons.

A few details about the business:

* They operate the shop entirely on their own without staff.
* The shop makes its own ice cream using a batch freezer, but coffee sales are stronger in the winter.
* They don‚Äôt do any marketing or have an online presence (social media, delivery, etc.).

I‚Äôve drafted a list of questions to ask during due diligence, but I‚Äôd love additional advice from the community.

Here‚Äôs what I plan to ask:

1. Financials: Revenue, costs, and profit margins for coffee and ice cream.
2. Equipment: Details about the batch freezer, coffee machines, and other tools.
3. Recipes and Suppliers: Clear, reproducible ice cream recipes and transferable supplier contacts.
4. Legalities: Lease transferability and operating restrictions in the mall.
5. Operations: Seasonal sales patterns and any opportunities for growth.
6. Transition: Support and training to ensure a smooth handover.

On a personal note, I work a 9‚Äì5 job and can only manage the shop evenings and weekends. I‚Äôm considering hiring part-time help for weekdays.

What else should I ask or consider before taking the plunge? I appreciate any insights from those experienced in small business ownership or food service.

1h3ndh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1h3ndh9/how_do_i_know/,How do I know?,"I (28M) am not sure if I have been manipulated or conditioned or whatever it‚Äôs called by my wife (29F). 

Not sure if it‚Äôs important but before our relationship she was in a very abusive relationship both physically and mentally. She also has a bachelors in psychology (not sure if important). So she knows a lot about this type of stuff and I know nothing about this stuff. 

Recently, I have been wondering if I have become conditioned/manipulated. My eyes ‚Äúopened‚Äù actually when her dad gave me magic mushrooms. We drove home and I started to pick stuff up from the passenger floor ‚Äúher seat‚Äù because it‚Äôs always messy unless I clean it. She said ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù But because I was on mushrooms this like alarm in my body/mind went off immediately, I felt like it was a controlling ‚Äúwhat are you doing‚Äù because how she said it and how I felt. Then I started to think about our past‚Ä¶. Super fun on mushrooms yay! Then I started to realize or think I‚Äôve been mentally abused, manipulated, conditioned or whatever. I know nothing about this stuff.

Another thing she loves to do is ‚Äúwhisper‚Äù shit under her breathe. I can hear it but barely and I‚Äôll ask her what‚Äôs she said and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúnothing don‚Äôt worry about‚Äù in an annoyed aggressive tone. 

She blames me for basically everything. She loves coffee and this one time I said no to getting coffee at a coffee stand because every damn day that money adds up! She then started to say ‚Äúyou always get your damn nicotine pouches! And I can‚Äôt get my coffee!?! Asshole!‚Äù I said, not the best response I know ‚ÄúI get my pouches about once or twice a month and it‚Äôs 6 bucks. Your coffee every day is 5-7 bucks‚Äù she ignored me and I still got her coffee so she wouldn‚Äôt be pissed all day. 

Another thing ‚Äúopened‚Äù my eyes, our kid walked outside in socks, it rained the night before. She didn‚Äôt want her shoes on even though we warned her it‚Äôs wet outside. She walks on the grass, my wife yells at me for allowing her to get her socks wet. So I picked her and say ‚Äúher socks aren‚Äôt wet, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù wife says ‚Äúno they are!‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI just felt them? They are dry‚Äù then my wife goes off on me about whatever and blames me etc etc. I ignore her and all is ‚Äúgood‚Äù. 

All in all, she loves going off me and blaming me for whatever. It could be the tiniest thing and she goes off on me.

She never cleans or helps with chores ever. I‚Äôve given up on asking for help because it‚Äôs useless and I don‚Äôt feel listening to an excuse. Her excuse is always ‚Äúthe kids need me, baby needs food, I don‚Äôt have time, i hate doing that (because as a kid she was abused if she didn‚Äôt do the chore correctly) and etc.‚Äù so I do all the chores and cleaning, I never ask for help anymore. She can‚Äôt do anything herself, she always ask me to do it. I‚Äôve started to say no and she‚Äôll get annoyed or pissed. She literally sits on her phone pretty much all day. It‚Äôs a hassle to even ask her to make dinner these days ‚Äúshe‚Äôs tired‚Äù. 

Another things I‚Äôve noticed is she will never go off on me in front of family. She did slip up and slightly went off on me when her dad was around. Idk if he heard or what but I was happy lol, I was like look!! I never say anything is her fault or get on her for anything because she‚Äôll start finding any little I do wrong and put it on blast. I‚Äôve also figured out she lied to me about a certain thing that cost a lot of money! 

Mentally, I am done with her tbh. I don‚Äôt like her anymore. Idk what to do because we have kids.

1h3n777,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1h3n777/trying_to_find_balance_between_maximizing_savings/,Trying to find balance between maximizing savings and enjoying what we‚Äôve earned.,"Hi everyone, 
My partner and I (28 M & F, respectively) have been struggling financially for a while, only about a year out of grad school with somewhat unsteady jobs, piecing things together month by month. We have never been able to do much due to not being able to afford it. Recently, I received a job offer for a salary of about $90k, take home after CA taxes is around $67-70k. He also just recently got a new job where he expects to make around the same, somewhere between $85-100k before taxes, depending on the year. If this comes to fruition in the way we think it will, I think our take home will be somewhere around $130k after taxes, or just over $10k per month. 

This is the first time we‚Äôve ever actually been able to have real finances to discuss, since all of our previous conversations have been mostly hypothetical for when we *do* have some money to plan around. Since we haven‚Äôt had much in the way of disposable income, our expenses are low (about $3000 per month including rent, utilities, groceries, gas, etc); we both agree we want to establish our HYSA emergency fund first, and 3 months would be about $10k. After this is created, we would have about $7k leftover to save, taking out ‚Äúfun money‚Äù for coffee or date nights or whatever. My calculation is that if we save $5-6k per month, this leaves us with somewhere around $60k in the bank at the end of next year, after taxes, monthly expenses, and emergency fund. If we both max out retirement funds, we‚Äôre looking at closer to $50k, which is the working number we‚Äôre using. 

My dad has always been my best friend and biggest supporter and he has done so much for me and for us while we‚Äôve been struggling. He also lives on a fixed income and is nowhere near where he wants to be financially, but he has never hesitated to help us when we need it, no questions asked, no strings attached. Since we would finally have a little bit of breathing room, I thought it might be nice to plan a trip to take him to somewhere like Vienna next Christmas to really treat him and say thank you for everything he‚Äôs done. I calculated that this trip would likely cost about $5k, being generous (ChatGPT said $3500 in its itinerary, and I added a buffer for unexpected travel costs since those always happen). I floated this idea to my partner thinking it would be a nice thing to do now that we could actually afford it, and he flew off the handle at the suggestion that we spend 10% of our savings on a trip. In my mind, if I save $50k in a year, get to take my dad on an incredible trip, have an emergency fund, max out everything I can, and still have $45k left in the bank at the end of it, I feel like that is AMAZING considering we are starting at 0. He, on the other hand, thinks it‚Äôs absolutely ludicrous to suggest spending 10% on one trip and thinks it should wait at least 2-3 years until it‚Äôs a smaller proportion of our funds, and insists that ‚Äúanyone who is even remotely financially literate‚Äù would agree that 10% is an obscene amount to spend on a vacation (regardless of the fact that 10% is a very low absolute number and can be replenished easily).

We have had our ups and downs, but arguably happy for the most part. We have a three year old and recently my wife started an intensive 1-year graduate business program.

We had a huge fight prior to the program starting, and since then she even told me that in hind sight, she doesn‚Äôt even think that was the worst fight we have had.

The problem is that my spouse has been so distant, told me she doesn‚Äôt want to be romantic (like no hugs or cutesie interactions). I completely respect it, but then she will act flirty for one moment and then go right back to actively avoiding me. I know she is busy with her program, but even the other day when I got her flowers, her response was: I wish you hadn‚Äôt done that. 

I‚Äôm trying to be supportive, but I can‚Äôt help but feel slighted. She studies hard and I know she is succeeding in her program, but again, why do I need to pushed to the side?

I tried talking to her about this and even said ‚Äúhey, I am actively trying to be better since we never reconciled fully from our fight. Im trying to grow, I also feel like I dont get any time of day from you.‚Äù

Her response: You‚Äôre being a narcissist making this situation about you.

A few days later, she said she wanted coffee and I jumped at the opportunity to make it for her and she got mad and said that I am trying to control her.

I recognize this isn‚Äôt the full picture, I know I am not perfect, but her comments are coming out of nowhere. I can‚Äôt try to help her because then Im pushing my agenda, and I can‚Äôt tell her I am sad because then she says I am a narcissist and trying to manipulate her with my emotions.

It‚Äôs honestly very isolating. I still take care of our son when I dont work so she knows that our kid is thriving and having lots of 1 on 1 with Dad, but I genuinely get the vibe that she doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me aside from being parents together.

I would really like some help or advice. I am sure there is something that I could improve but idk what that is. Im given no more than 5-10 minutes a day to connect (mostly on our kid and plans for them) but other than that, she leaves to study, spends forever in the bathroom if its around bedtime‚Äîalmost like waiting me to go to sleep‚Äîand doesn‚Äôt bother reading any texts I send until later.

Understanding God's will can sometimes feel like trying to find your way in a dense fog‚Äîyou know there's a path, but you just can't see it clearly. It's easy to wonder if you‚Äôre on the right track, or if you're missing something. But here's the good news: you don't have to navigate life‚Äôs uncertainties alone. Prayer is your GPS, your compass, and your guide. Through daily communication with God, you invite His wisdom and guidance into your life, helping you understand His purpose for you.

Each day brings decisions, big and small, and sometimes the road ahead seems unclear. But when we commit to seeking God‚Äôs guidance through prayer, He promises to lead us. The key is to trust that He is always speaking, even when we can‚Äôt hear Him clearly. 

In this post, we‚Äôll explore five powerful prayers that will help you understand God‚Äôs will more deeply and follow His path with confidence.

# Prayer for Guidance in Daily Decisions

# Why God‚Äôs Guidance Matters in Everyday Choices

Life is made up of decisions, both major and minor. Sometimes we feel overwhelmed by them, unsure of what path to take. But God is in the business of guiding His people through the daily grind. He doesn‚Äôt just care about the big moments‚ÄîHe cares about every detail of your life. When we pray for His guidance, we open the door for His wisdom to lead us, even in the smallest choices.

# A Prayer for Daily Wisdom

‚ÄúLord, I seek Your wisdom in every choice I make today. Help me recognize Your voice in the noise of the world. When I face decisions, big or small, guide me to make choices that reflect Your love and truth. Amen.‚Äù

Sometimes, it‚Äôs easy to think God only cares about the ‚Äúbig‚Äù decisions‚Äîwhere to work, who to marry, where to live. But He‚Äôs interested in your day-to-day choices, too. Every decision is an opportunity to invite Him into your life. When you‚Äôre stuck in a dilemma, take a moment to pause, pray, and ask for His guidance. It‚Äôs that simple, yet that powerful.

# Action Step: Start Each Day With Prayer

The best way to make this prayer effective is by beginning each day with it. Before diving into the busyness of life, take a quiet moment to ask God for wisdom and guidance. Whether you‚Äôre making a decision at work, dealing with a difficult conversation, or simply deciding what to have for lunch, ask for His input. Trust that He will guide your choices throughout the day.

# Prayer for Strength to Follow God's Plan

# Why We Need God‚Äôs Strength to Walk in His Will

The road to understanding God‚Äôs will isn‚Äôt always easy. It often requires us to step out of our comfort zones, face challenges, and sometimes even make sacrifices. Following God's plan for our lives may mean taking risks or walking through hard seasons. That‚Äôs why we need His strength‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs in our weaknesses that His power is made perfect.

# A Prayer for Strength to Stay the Course

‚ÄúLord, give me the strength to follow Your plan, even when it feels uncertain. Help me to trust in Your timing, knowing that Your plan for me is better than anything I could imagine. Strengthen my faith and help me stay faithful, no matter the obstacles. Amen.‚Äù

Walking in God‚Äôs plan requires more than just a desire‚Äîit requires strength. Strength to trust when things get hard, to move forward when you can‚Äôt see the full picture. It‚Äôs okay to feel weak. God is not expecting perfection. What He wants is a heart that is willing to say yes, even when the path ahead is unclear.

# Action Step: Recognize God‚Äôs Strength in Your Struggles

When challenges arise, recognize that your struggles are an opportunity to lean into God‚Äôs strength. Instead of relying solely on your own abilities, allow God to fill you with the courage you need. Remind yourself that His power is always available to carry you through any situation.

# Prayer for Clarity in Understanding God's Purpose

# Finding Clarity in a Cloud of Confusion

We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîsitting in the middle of life‚Äôs mess, wondering what on earth God wants us to do next. The future may feel uncertain, or you might be at a crossroads, unsure of where to turn. This is where God‚Äôs clarity comes in. Prayer isn‚Äôt just about asking for answers‚Äîit‚Äôs about quieting our hearts long enough to listen for His voice. When we ask for clarity, He promises to speak into our confusion.

# A Prayer for Clarity

‚ÄúGod, open my eyes to see Your purpose for me. Remove the fog of confusion, and help me hear Your voice clearly. I trust that You will lead me with wisdom, and I‚Äôm ready to follow. Amen.‚Äù

Seeking clarity requires patience. Sometimes, the answers don‚Äôt come immediately, but when we seek God through prayer, He promises to reveal what‚Äôs next in His perfect timing. You might not have all the answers right away, but the process of seeking God‚Äôs purpose brings a peace that transcends understanding.

# Action Step: Practice Quiet Time

Make it a daily practice to spend quiet moments in God‚Äôs presence. Whether it‚Äôs during your morning coffee or a break in the middle of your day, take a moment to pause and listen. Ask for clarity, but also trust that He will guide you even when the answers don‚Äôt come right away.

# Prayer for Acceptance of God‚Äôs Will

# Letting Go of Our Own Plans

It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of thinking we know best. We plan, we dream, and we work hard to achieve our goals. But what happens when God‚Äôs plan for us looks different than we expected? That‚Äôs where the true test of faith begins. Accepting God‚Äôs will isn‚Äôt always easy, but it‚Äôs always the best thing for us. Trusting that His plan is better than our own is the key to peace.

# A Prayer of Surrender

‚ÄúFather, help me to accept Your will in my life, even when it‚Äôs different from my own desires. Teach me to trust that Your plans for me are good, even if I can‚Äôt see the whole picture. I surrender my will to You, knowing that You know what‚Äôs best. Amen.‚Äù

Sometimes, God‚Äôs will means we have to let go of our own plans. It‚Äôs tough, no doubt, but it‚Äôs also incredibly freeing. When we stop trying to control every outcome and trust in God‚Äôs sovereignty, we find peace that surpasses understanding.

# Action Step: Let Go of Control

Today, take a step back and ask yourself, ‚ÄúAm I holding onto something I need to surrender to God?‚Äù It might be a decision, a relationship, or even a dream. Give it to God, trusting that He will guide you in the best direction, even if it‚Äôs not the one you imagined.

# Prayer for Alignment with God‚Äôs Will

# Aligning Your Heart with God‚Äôs Desires

Living in alignment with God‚Äôs will means that your desires start to reflect His. It‚Äôs about becoming so in tune with His heart that what He wants for you becomes what you want for yourself. This alignment doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but with daily prayer, we begin to transform. God‚Äôs desires become our desires, and that‚Äôs when true fulfillment starts to take shape.

# A Prayer for Alignment

‚ÄúLord, align my heart with Yours. Help me to desire what You desire and to see the world through Your eyes. May my life reflect Your goodness and bring glory to Your name. Amen.‚Äù

Alignment with God is like tuning a guitar. At first, the strings might feel out of tune, but as you adjust, the harmony begins to form. It takes time and effort, but when we align our desires with God‚Äôs, the music of our life becomes more beautiful and purposeful.

# Action Step: Reflect on Your Desires

Take a moment today to reflect on your desires. Are they in line with God‚Äôs will for your life? If not, ask God to help align your heart with His. Let Him gently adjust your path, trusting that His ways are better than yours.

# Conclusion

Understanding and following God‚Äôs will is a daily journey, not a one-time event. Through prayer, we invite God into every area of our lives, allowing Him to guide our steps, strengthen our hearts, and shape our desires. Whether you‚Äôre making decisions, facing challenges, or simply seeking His clarity, these prayers can help you grow closer to His purpose for you. Remember, God is always there, ready to guide you if you seek Him.

As you continue on your journey, let these prayers be a reminder that God‚Äôs will is good, pleasing, and perfect. Trust Him, lean on Him, and know that with every step, He is leading you exactly where you need to be.

1h3n29v,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h3n29v/update_no_2_6_months_i_got_a_girlfriend_after/,UPDATE No. 2 (6 months): I got a girlfriend after being single for 9 years! ,"I just wanted to see what she looked like in the shower, and now I'm answering the nurses questions about her health insurance and medical history?

I mean yeah, I'm down, but wtf happened? I am, as a total computer nerd, all of a sudden responsible for this beautiful woman who is, frankly, way out of my league, who I love and who is in love with me.

I need to have the Minecraft server login memorized AND her social security number?!

Who tf authorized this? How did I even get this far?!?

And a quick heads up, just because her new hospital room is in the [ONCOLOGY](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/finding-care/what-is-oncology.html) (https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/finding-care/what-is-oncology.html) department, 5 stories up from where we were for 3 days with no information, and everyone is being *real* fucking cagey to her about what's going on, apparently that does NOT mean she has cancer.

And NO, you cannot find that out until her dad (who you've built a fire with and gone deep sea fishing with) is packing a bag and bought a flight and her mom (who ""doesn't like people"" but surprisingly gave you (yes I'm bragging) a 9/10) is having a panic attack over the phone with you and you're trying to figure out how qto tell both of these people who just love their daughter so much as well as the sleep deprived and in pain woman you somehow conviced to fall in love with you that everything will be okay (but you don't actually know that) and you tell her parents that you will and you do advocate for her and figure out what the actual fuck is going on by making a nurse who does not give one single fuck and frankly seems like she'd rather be eating garlic parmesan traditional at B'dubs go ask the Infectious Disease Specialist to read the results and step into the room for one minute (after waiting two days!) to explain that it's just a very weird kidney infection that wouldn't show up on CT, Ultra, X-ray or any other scan except the blood culture lab results that take 48 hours to get back but the kind lab people WILL NOT TELL ANYONE.

Anyway, all you know is that no one is saying shit and they're taking you and the woman of your dreams to the FCD (Fucking Cancer Department, it's a made up acronym). She is sobbing and holding you, her parents are on the phone, and you're just wondering how you're supposed to react while you're internally melting into a puddle of despair.

Also, you're going to fall in love with her dog, and you need to feed and take her for a long walk twice per day. She's an English Black Lab named Roxy who has ZERO spacial awareness and will unknowingly try to knock the entire coffee table over and eat your cat's (your son named Dwight)'s poop at every opportunity. She will do a run-by-cat-vomit-lick in a split second and keep running down the stairs like that didn't just happen.

I am going to have children with this woman. I have a ring for her (a 2ct green sapphire emerald cut with 10 tiny diamonds on the sides down the ring all set in 14k yellow gold), and it's, by far, the largest purchase I've made in 10 years. I honestly was surprised by the tax because I had never seen it that high.

I am a broke computer nerd! This is who I am. What is happening?

1h3n1a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1h3n1a4/cannua_lodge_review_marinilla_colombia_mr_mrs/,"Cannua Lodge Review, Marinilla Colombia (Mr & Mrs. Smith property) ","**TL;DR** | Our 4-day stay at Cannua was INCREDIBLE. One of the best experiences I‚Äôve had traveling. The food was amazing, staff incredible and deeply personable, stunning property and surroundings, and the overall eco-philosophy was fascinating, inspiring, and restorative. It was the best part of our Colombia trip and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.¬†

What is Cannua: A luxury eco-lodge built on the principles of permaculture (sustainable design, integration with nature, preservation and spotlighting of what the environment has to offer) in the mountains outside of Medellin (approx. 50 mins drive from airport or 1.5 hrs from the city). They pride themselves on their food (mostly grown in their gardens), curated list of activities, and relaxing atmosphere.¬†

Highlights:¬†

* Food: This is a gastro-experience and the food we ate rivaled (if not surpassed) all the Colombian fine dining we experienced in Medellin and Colombia. The herbs, vegetables, and flowers, all grown in the local garden were extremely fresh and delicious. Truly some of the best produce I‚Äôve experienced. Example of a main: ‚Äúsustainable whitefish from the Colombian pacific, served with a beurre blanc of 3 types of passionfruit) and honey with crispy sweet plantain gnocchi and grated coconut with a rum reduction sauce, lime, and sugarcane pulp accompanied with vegetables from our gardens‚Äù. Mains run about $15-20 and apps/desserts closer to $10.
* Drinks: Every cocktail we tried was amazing. Again, they leverage local ingredients and have clearly put a lot of thought into their menu. Example drink: Beetroot Time - Mezcal, ancho Reyes chili liqueur, beetroot and sage syrup, red fruit, balsamic shrub, and lime. Around $10 for a drink. They also have a wonderful partnership with a local beer brewery and offer 8 Belgian style beers brewed by 2 Belgians who moved to Colombia to bring the style to Latin America (Torrealta Cervezeria) as well as local coffee, rum, and chocolate producers who embody the ethos of Cannua.¬†
* Design: Though small (18 rooms total), Cannua is stunning. The rooms are bright, well-furnished, and covered in lush greenery. The entire resort boasts stunning views and is meticulously integrated into its environment. Dining tables made of natural wood, muted, natural toned bathrooms with hanging plants, and¬†
* Staff: All amazing and fluent in English. Special shoutout to Fabian who guided us through the permaculture tour, the chocolate tasting, and had exceptional recommendations at dinner. They are all very bought into the eco philosophy of the resort, and their passion for Cannua is palpable.¬†
* Experiences: We partook in the chocolate tasting, the permaculture tour, and the pre-hispanic trail hike during our time here. We also got massages. All were great! For the first 3, the staff was extremely knowledgable and personable. On our hike, our guide explained the history of the trail and the diverse flora and fauna to us, and also had us smell and taste a few wild products along the way! The permaculture tour was similarly fantastic, and learning more about the history and philosophies of the property was one of our favorite parts of our stay. Massages were good and affordable ($60 for an hour), though not the focal point of the experience. Our favorite part, however, was just relaxing and reading or drinking/eating with the mountains in the background ‚Äî the atmosphere is the height of relaxation.¬†

Some things to look out for:¬†

* Discomforts: The road up to the resort is ROCKY. If you have a bad back or neck, you may find this tough for about 20 mins. Some of the cabanas are very high up and require a good amount of climbing daily at altitude. Not terrible if you‚Äôre young and mobile, but again might be a drawback. The hot water gets hot but there‚Äôs a tradeoff between pressure and warmth (i.e., only gets truly hot if you are okay with lower pressure). Lastly, there are some bugs but that is to be expected for a resort of this kind ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt find the bugs to be disruptive.
* No coffee maker in non-Cabana rooms: The coffee at breakfast is great, but if you‚Äôre a big coffee lover like us you‚Äôll find the trek from your room to breakfast sluggish without your first cup in the room.¬†
* Salt levels: Many of the dishes were a little on the salty side. If you notice this, definitely ask them to modify and they‚Äôll be more than happy to do so. Food was less salty on our final days.¬†

All-in spend for 2 (food/drink + activities and massages + accommodation) was about $1000 (US, 3 nights 4 days), which felt like a steal for what we got. If you‚Äôre in Colombia or even a neighboring country, I‚Äôd highly recommend a detour here. We can‚Äôt wait to go back.",3,1733002604.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

1h3mysc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1h3mysc/cannua_lodge_review_marinilla_colombia_mr_mrs/,"Cannua Lodge Review, Marinilla Colombia (Mr & Mrs. Smith property)","Finding some positivity in the broader anti-MMS crusade!¬†



Disclaimer that I was able to book the property for around 13k points per night though opted to book with cash for \~$150 per night for a standard room ‚Äî if you are after killing cpp redemptions, spending on MMS is obviously is not for you.¬†



**TL;DR** | Our 4-day stay at Cannua was INCREDIBLE. One of the best experiences I‚Äôve had traveling. The food was amazing, staff incredible and deeply personable, stunning property and surroundings, and the overall eco-philosophy was fascinating, inspiring, and restorative. It was the best part of our Colombia trip and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.¬†



What is Cannua: A luxury eco-lodge built on the principles of permaculture (sustainable design, integration with nature, preservation and spotlighting of what the environment has to offer) in the mountains outside of Medellin (approx. 50 mins drive from airport or 1.5 hrs from the city). They pride themselves on their food (mostly grown in their gardens), curated list of activities, and relaxing atmosphere.¬†



Highlights:¬†

* Food: This is a gastro-experience and the food we ate rivaled (if not surpassed) all the Colombian fine dining we experienced in Medellin and Colombia. The herbs, vegetables, and flowers, all grown in the local garden were extremely fresh and delicious. Truly some of the best produce I‚Äôve experienced. Example of a main: ‚Äúsustainable whitefish from the Colombian pacific, served with a beurre blanc of 3 types of passionfruit) and honey with crispy sweet plantain gnocchi and grated coconut with a rum reduction sauce, lime, and sugarcane pulp accompanied with vegetables from our gardens‚Äù. Mains run about $15-20 and apps/desserts closer to $10. 



* Drinks: Every cocktail we tried was amazing. Again, they leverage local ingredients and have clearly put a lot of thought into their menu. Example drink: Beetroot Time - Mezcal, ancho Reyes chili liqueur, beetroot and sage syrup, red fruit, balsamic shrub, and lime. Around $10 for a drink. They also have a wonderful partnership with a local beer brewery and offer 8 Belgian style beers brewed by 2 Belgians who moved to Colombia to bring the style to Latin America (Torrealta Cervezeria) as well as local coffee, rum, and chocolate producers who embody the ethos of Cannua.¬†



* Design: Though small (18 rooms total), Cannua is stunning. The rooms are bright, well-furnished, and covered in lush greenery. The entire resort boasts stunning views and is meticulously integrated into its environment. Dining tables made of natural wood, muted, natural toned bathrooms with hanging plants, and¬†



* Staff: All amazing and fluent in English. Special shoutout to Fabian who guided us through the permaculture tour, the chocolate tasting, and had exceptional recommendations at dinner. They are all very bought into the eco philosophy of the resort, and their passion for Cannua is palpable.¬†



* Experiences: We partook in the chocolate tasting, the permaculture tour, and the pre-hispanic trail hike during our time here. We also got massages. All were great! For the first 3, the staff was extremely knowledgable and personable. On our hike, our guide explained the history of the trail and the diverse flora and fauna to us, and also had us smell and taste a few wild products along the way! The permaculture tour was similarly fantastic, and learning more about the history and philosophies of the property was one of our favorite parts of our stay. Massages were good and affordable ($60 for an hour), though not the focal point of the experience. Our favorite part, however, was just relaxing and reading or drinking/eating with the mountains in the background ‚Äî the atmosphere is the height of relaxation.¬†





Some things to look out for:¬†

* Award redemption: MMS obviously isn‚Äôt great for award travel so it may make more sense to book on cash, but if you‚Äôre not anchored to the highest cpp, you can get a wonderful free stay here that would beat many ‚Äúbetter‚Äù redemptions. 



* Discomforts: The road up to the resort is ROCKY. If you have a bad back or neck, you may find this tough for about 20 mins. Some of the cabanas are very high up and require a good amount of climbing daily at altitude. Not terrible if you‚Äôre young and mobile, but again might be a drawback. The hot water gets hot but there‚Äôs a tradeoff between pressure and warmth (i.e., only gets truly hot if you are okay with lower pressure). Lastly, there are some bugs but that is to be expected for a resort of this kind ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt find the bugs to be disruptive. 



* No coffee maker in non-Cabana rooms: The coffee at breakfast is great, but if you‚Äôre a big coffee lover like us you‚Äôll find the trek from your room to breakfast sluggish without your first cup in the room.¬†



* Salt levels: Many of the dishes were a little on the salty side. If you notice this, definitely ask them to modify and they‚Äôll be more than happy to do so. Food was less salty on our final days.¬†



All-in spend for 2 (food/drink + activities and massages + accommodation) was about $1000 (US, 3 nights 4 days), which felt like a steal for what we got. If you‚Äôre in Colombia or even a neighboring country, I‚Äôd highly recommend a detour here. We can‚Äôt wait to go back.¬†",2,1733002407.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False

I've spent the past few weeks playing around with my Aiden and now that we have the ability to share profiles I thought it might be cool to try to put together a central listing of profiles we can share.

Introducing: [https://brewshare.coffee](https://brewshare.coffee)

At the moment it's a spot where you can post a link to a profile you have created and make mentions of the bean type, roaster, brewing notes, etc. Clicking on the link will take you to the official Fellow website to add the profile in to your app.

I would love to get anyone's feedback on what is missing or what I could do better (I'm aware on mobile it's not a great experience just yet, a little bit messy). I picked a couple of profiles I found on Reddit but please feel free to submit your own!

I am planning to implement the ability to filter and sort the table (think: filter for only light roast or Ethiopian beans) but I've been typing away all day and need a bit of rest :)

For anyone wondering about the email field on the form: I also plan to have the ability to create your own user profile where you can manage the brews you have submitted (update the notes, delete them entirely, etc). It will **not** be used for any sort of marketing and is currently stored in the database encrypted (even I can't read them). The plan is to implement with an actual authentication provider which will allow you to sign in with Google (or others) and only then would I do any matching of actual email addresses. Feel free to leave it out if you prefer!

And to the Fellow team: if this functionality is something your team is already working on and would like me to back off, just let me know.

1h3mwb1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3mwb1,First time citrus owner,"I got this Meyer‚Äôs lemon tree back in early October. When I first got it the box was all tore up and the leaves had been folded. There is some scaring on the leaves but for the most part I thought it looked pretty good. 

Fast forward to this week. A leaf fell off a few days ago. When the leaf fell off it was very green and I have no idea why it fell off. 

A few weeks ago I had posted because it looked like white mold was starting to form, it was suggested the soil was packed too tight and I was over water. I have since then poked around and loosened the soil and I have only watered 2 1/2 times since getting. I have it some fertilizer once per the instructions, and I have laid some coffee grounds on top once (about 1 tbsp). 

It‚Äôs about 66-67 in our house right now l (Midwest) and I keep a lamp on about 12 hours a day. 

Some leaves have a little yellow on them, is this to be expected for this time of year and temp? 

I also wanted to mention I‚Äôve seen a few little black bugs on/in the soil but they don‚Äôt look like citrus mites when googled. Today when I was taking photos I also noticed it looks like some green mold is forming. I can‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I used cactus soil mix and I won‚Äôt water until a wooden stick I have is bone dry on the bottom of the pot.

1h3muag,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1h3muag/sleep_and_insulin_resistance/,Sleep and insulin resistance ,"This is probably old news for most of you here, but I feel like it‚Äôs worth talking about because the effect of sleep on my sugar control is ridiculous. I mean, one bad night‚Äôs sleep and my insulin resistance goes absolutely haywire.

Take this week, for example: after a night out with a couple of G&Ts (responsible enough, right?), I idiotically followed it up with a coffee. Couldn‚Äôt sleep till well after 1 a.m., and then dragged myself out of bed for work. Despite sticking to a low-carb snack that morning, my blood sugars shot up to 14 mmol. I threw five units of insulin at it over the course of the morning, and it barely nudged‚Äîstill hanging around 12 for hours. That insulin resistance stayed with me all day and didn‚Äôt really settle until the evening. It was almost laughable (except it wasn‚Äôt).

The first time I realised how bad sleep affects me was back when I used to do shift work, about 3 years after diagnosis. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why my blood sugars were always so off in that job‚Äîthen one day it hit me. After a bad night‚Äôs sleep, my sugars would stay unpredictable for up to 36 hours. The insulin resistance was unreal, and once I made the connection, it was like a lightbulb moment.

I‚Äôm sure loads of you already know this and manage your sleep like pros, but if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs honestly a game-changer. The difference between a terrible night‚Äôs sleep and a solid one is profound. 

I genuinely hope this helps somebody.",3,1733002065.0,diabetes_t1,1,1.0,False

Anything goes from ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else. 

I'm a working professional. Outside of work, I volunteer, exercise, visit local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, and read. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too üëª

The employee told me the scent actually comes from a specific perfume (shows the picture), so I bought that perfume, but I still prefer the candle‚Äôs scent. I can‚Äôt tell you the exact name, but it‚Äôs something like rose roots. The room spray version is amazing. Oh, and a member‚Äôs name is part of it.

**Q: Coffee?**  
Smash! We're done now. This is everything I prepared for you guys. Now it's your turn to share some icebreakers! (she didn't actually say ""smash"" to all these but yeah)

**Below are her comments expressing gratitude for the opportunities she‚Äôs been given:**

""You guys are asking about my tolerance limit? To be honest, I have no idea. I haven‚Äôt drank enough to figure it out yet. Plus, I don‚Äôt drink to the point of getting hammered when I‚Äôm outside. Also, I think I look pretty bad when I drink. So what happens when I drink is... umm, my eyes get unfocused and I can‚Äôt stop sucking on my lips. You know what happens when you do that? Your lips just disappear and lose the color! So yeah, it‚Äôs not a good look.

This is actually something I mentioned briefly and half-jokingly while filming *Workdol* today. Reflecting on my youth, my brightness, and the passion I have at 21, I feel so lucky that I get to leave these moments as permanent records. Of course, I‚Äôve dreamt of becoming a singer since I was 10, and now I‚Äôve achieved that dream. It makes me so happy when fans capture beautiful photos and videos of me when I‚Äôm fully dressed up on stage, doing my absolute best to perform. Watching those moments fills me with so much joy.

Being able to preserve these days... the youngest, hardest-working, and most exciting time of my life is something I‚Äôm truly grateful for. I‚Äôm so thankful I can do this job. If I hadn‚Äôt taken that audition at Yongin back then, would I be doing *Monthly Oh Haewon* for you all now? No, probably not, right? When else would someone like me, get to sit next to a legend like Bae Cheolsoo and talk about music on *Immersive Lifestory* (He is the most well-respected radio host and former singer)? Having the chance to have a meaningful conversation about music with Bae Cheolsoo sunbaenim is such an incredible opportunity, one that I‚Äôm sure won‚Äôt come around again. I really thought about how lucky I am during that moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and since we‚Äôre talking about hate comments... I mean, do I even have hate comments, guys? üòÇ Or am I just not seeing them? I can‚Äôt really find hate comments about me. Of course, they definitely exist, I‚Äôm sure they do. I‚Äôve seen them before. But you know, I‚Äôve never even imagined writing something nasty about someone else in my life. Why? Because I‚Äôm way too busy living my own life.

I once read something that really stuck with me: people who write hate comments are usually those who don‚Äôt find their own lives very interesting. It means their lives are that boring. So! I should actually be thankful, right? If my existence gives them something to be interested in, even if it‚Äôs just writing hate comments, then I should be grateful for it! üòÇ

I realized it‚Äôs better to just feel sorry for them. Honestly, it‚Äôs a relief. I can think, ‚ÄòThank goodness I exist, so I can bring a little excitement to your otherwise dull life!‚Äô That mindset really helped me put things into perspective.‚Äù",15,1733002019.0,NMIXX,2,1.0,False

it feels like reze could fill that void inside of me, not that i want her to, it's the matter of her existence, she could be there, try to destroy me, be nice to me or just breathe, doesn't really matter, as long as she's there i couldn't ask for anything more, you see this panel

this, exactly this is all i could ask for, to wake up and see her face, to close my eyes and be able to remember memories of me and her, to be able to call her and have her turn around to see who called her name, to exist next to her and feel the touch of her hand, to hear her voice, to look at her until she turns to me and look away after our eyes meet, to make her coffee and breakfast every morning, brush her hair before going to work when she doesn't feel like doing so, to be able to say she's a part of my life, that, that would be way more than enough to get me out of my bed every morning and give me reason and hope to live another day and be actually excited about my day! to look forward to what the day brings me because at the end of the day nothing could matter more than seeing her, experiencing another day with her;

honestly i was jumping around and biting myself after i saw her in that panel after so long, just seeing her image helped me go through weeks wonderfully, i started college, I'm getting my driving license, and I'm even learning sign language! all I'm saying is that I can't have any, absolutely ANY reason to choose anyone or anything else when she can easily be my reason to live, i chose her yesterday, i choose her today, and i will choose her any other day as long as i live and there's a me in this world, i love reze and I'm so happy to exist in a timeline that i could get to know her and i will never forget herüñ§",1,1733001805.0,Chainsawfolk,6,1.0,False

If my loser has been good, I love to hand out treats. Let me spoil you by sending any picture, of ANYTHING you‚Äôd like nothing is too weird. Or I‚Äôll roleplay anything my loser likes..But first, proof me ur loyalty.

I am the priority in your life. Someone who devotes their life to me. Their own needs are erased, just my needs and the need to spoil and serve me in their vision.

I am not searching someone just for money (i work full time, high function, i earn alot). But receiving money, someone WANTING to spoil me makes everything more exciting and real.

1h3mlw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h3mlw7/im_catching_feelings_for_my_roommates_brother/,I‚Äôm catching feelings for my roommate‚Äôs brother.,"I had met him once before. She was building a privacy curtain for me when I moved into her apartment. Her brother works in construction and lives down the street, so she took me to his house and said I could come in. He was very bashful, it was a sweet moment. We were cracking stupid jokes.

Thanksgiving comes, my roommate decided to host dinner at our house. Her family, her boyfriend‚Äôs family, and a few other coworkers were all in attendance. Before the party, she was making seating arrangements. Every time she would sit her brother next to me, I‚Äôd get a little excited. I‚Äôd quietly get sad when she moved him away.

The party begins and I change into my evening gown. We see each other and he says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve met before, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù and I say, ‚ÄúWe have,‚Äù making very strong eye contact. He played the game of pretending to forget my name. He remembered it after ‚Äúthinking‚Äù about it for a second. I have a fairly unusual name.

The party was getting started, and the roommate‚Äôs brother was in the kitchen with the roommate‚Äôs boyfriend. The boyfriend and I are friends. I said, ‚ÄúMen in the kitchen, I love to see it‚Äù and took a photo on my camera.

We were seated next to each other. During grace, we joined hands in prayer. He made sure my hand was on top and I can‚Äôt lie, I caressed his fingers with my thumb LMFAOOOO!!! ü§≠ As we said ‚Äúamen,‚Äù we squeezed each other‚Äôs hands. The person holding my other hand didn‚Äôt squeeze it.

I‚Äôm a very bubbly person. I love to laugh, I love to giggle, joke around, and just express to people how much I love them. But the families invited are kind of ‚Äúhigh class,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to explain. My roommate was very adamant about having perfect lighting and putting certain people at certain parts of the table. Timeliness and dress were very important to them. They‚Äôre also very into politics, military, all that official stuff. Suuuper conservative and Christian.

I say that because I was beside the girl‚Äôs brother and again, we were cutting up a bit. I dropped a piece of lasagna on my foot and he whispers, ‚ÄúI saw that,‚Äù making me giggle and blush out of embarrassment. So I tried to tone it down a little. I tried to be nonchalant. I don‚Äôt drink but maybe a few times out of the year, and I had a glass of red wine. I always get into a laughing fit when I drink so I tried stifling it, but their father noticed. He‚Äôs judgmental, so I‚Äôm not sure if he was laughing along or sizing me up.

The Brother starts chatting away. Turns out he OWNS his construction business at 23. He‚Äôs showing me graphs and talking about clients. I‚Äôm deep in his files and they‚Äôre so organized. He‚Äôs currently working on a project at my favorite coffee shop. We‚Äôre both a little tipsy. I remember putting an hors d'oeuvres in my mouth, and he watched it go in and stumbled over his words a bit. Chile‚Ä¶

I was also seated next to my roommate‚Äôs boyfriend. Honestly, that was probably the best decision because he alleviated some of the awkwardness when needed. I had turned away from The Brother for a moment and he touched my arm to get my attention to show me more graphs. It was too cute. I was still wearing my RBF as well as I could, which was not well at all LMAOOO. I just really didn‚Äôt want to be all over him in front of his family and embarrass him. But I really liked him.

I talked to The Boyfriend after the party and asked if I was a good guest/host. He was a little surprised that I asked, because I WAS a great guest. The only thing he says is, ‚Äúyou were chatting up a storm with [Her Brother]!‚Äù Cover blown. LMAO.

I went to sleep thinking about him. Girl, that wine was WINING. I also woke up thinking about him, which is rare‚Ä¶ Wondering when I‚Äôll see him again. Hmmm‚Ä¶

I mostly wanted to gush about my night, but any advice on moving forward would be appreciated. He seemed pretty into me, too. He doesn‚Äôt have social media (maybe Facebook, but it‚Äôs not like I looked him up or anything‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.) and he lives maybe 5 minutes away. There‚Äôs just no reason I would see him unless it‚Äôs another spontaneous or planned thing by my roommate. Christmas is coming, so maybe then. Not really sure.

I am female, 34, 5'3, 120 lb, non-smoker.

Yesterday I was shopping, and carrying some clothes around. I thought they smelled of sweat, but then realized it was my own armpits. I was shocked, because¬†**I never, ever had any armpit smell.**

For context, I have a recessive¬†*ABCC11*¬†gene, and I have never in my life had any distinctive armpit smell, even if I happened not to shower for days or sweat profusely. It's been noticed by all of partners, and I had only realized that when I was an adult. I really enjoy not having to wear a deodorant, and smell great.

I got home and I thought that maybe I was trying something on and someone else's sweat rubbed off on me. I took a shower and changed into clean clothes. Spend the evening and the night wearing the same t-shirt to bed. When I woke up and had a coffee, I started smelling my armpits again. It was not as bad, but there was definitely a faint odor of sweat.

I am not sure what could have changed, and how I could suddenly start having an odor. I don't know much about genetics, except for I took a 23andme test, and that I never smelled before. Internet says hormones or diet, but I am not sure if it works that way.

I took another shower and I am now nervously smelling my armpits every five minutes. Does anyone have an idea of what might have happened or has this happened to anyone else?",1,1733001047.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

But there's so much to it than that.

The history is we met 14 years ago (absolute fireworks and blown away with how we both felt for each other instantly) just after we'd both been in bad breakups. His ex had run off (litteraly) with another bloke whilst she was still pregnant with his baby (yes there was a DNA test). She was a nasty piece of work and the texts she would send you would have thought it was he that abandoned him. Sadly the stress of everything (both of us suffering from our own bagge) was just too much and our relationship eventually failed.

We stayed friends and would confide in  each other about everything. This would include me trying to support him as much as I could as he battled to get access to his child. Overtime I knew she moved from being aggressive to him to the sending inappropriate and unrequested for pics when her bloke dumped her. She really is all sorts of wrong. He put up with it so she didn't stop access. I had no relationship with him then so he had no reason to lie. And we've always been eye-wateringly honest with each other, so if he felt differently I would have known.

Between me and him over the years,  whenever we grew too close he would get freaked out and do something to push me away and I would be firey and blow up. Basically it was a whole lot of Carrie and Big in all honesty. And in 2018 I pulled the plug on the friendship. 
In that time (before as well as during), he worked hard to placate his ex so he could get a good co-parenting relationship with her. She still lives 3 hours away so he uses all his holiday to have his child 5 weeks in the year dotted throughout. He really is a great Dad and it's wonderful what he does in person or from afar.

Last year we started texting and met a couple of times for a coffee. But it wasn't exactly the same. But this July, we started messaging and something changed. We met for a meal (I suggested a drink to celebrate him buying a new house and he suggested a meal). By the time we saw each other my old feelings were coming back and turned out that it was the same for him. 
We decided to take it slowly (we had finally learnt from old errors) and it's been going well. 

This weekend, we were going to have a big day/evening out, including staying in a hotel and it felt like a big step. Especially as when we saw each other last 2 weeks ago, it was absolutely 'take your breath away, blissful and so emotionally intimate' time. We've been gently talking about the future and with my friends I've been saying that this could be it. Walking on cloud 9 is about the right phrase. 

Tuesday I had a msg apologising profusely but he had to cancel because all of a sudden his ex got work this weekend right near here and so he would get his child. This has never happened. In fact any vists she never drives the child, so it's........curious timing. But I was excited that he gets extra time which is amazing. 

Yesterday i only found out after picking up on a phrasing of a msg that his ex will also be staying with him. He thought it was a straightforward option as she'd be at work till late and why wouldn't he offer a spare room.
I told him it was all sorts of level of fucked up and bizarre (potentially I could have been more delicate but tbh I was grossed out and it was the lesser version). 
She arrived Friday night and I've been absolutely tortured about it since. Just knowing she's in his new house which previously felt like such a happy haven for me is making me feel violated. 

You won't believe it but I genuinely trust him. I've known him as a mate more than as an other half and he was one of the few lads in our group that would never cheat on someone. 

I do think he's been a classic and cliche non thinking bloke thinking its a straightforward thing to offer.  But his ex? What woman would agree to stay with an ex unless she had nefarious reasons? As much as I'd be polite to any of my exs, I'd rather sleep in my car or a park bench tbh than in the same building as them!

I genuinely want to know if anyone has had this kind of arrangement with an ex. Because the friends I've spoken to (male and female inc a single parent) all think it's creepy but is it just us? I'm kind of desperate to see the other side as I do strive to be balanced in life but this is too much for my head to get round.
I can't begin to tell you how much this has impacted me this weekend. The images in my head her getting comfy there is making me feel sick. 
Any advice welcome please.

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily.

Long story short late September I was cold stone sober for a few months and then went on a crazy weekend binge. Not even sure what happened that night but I was coma level intoxicated and one arm and hand exploded in size at least 3x size. Most likely passed out for 12+ hours with my arm jammed behind a piece of furniture, guessing I yanked it out at some point. Woke up to rhabdo and a bunch of open wounds and a non working hand. Straight to the icu. Pee was coffee colored, almost went to dialysis.

My ck levels were 45,000+

My hand is still numb and burning, can‚Äôt grasp, pinch, twist, etc. I‚Äôm in occupational therapy, pain management, ortho appointments, doing everything at home I can possibly do - following physical therapy instructions when I‚Äôm not in their office. I take gabapentin for nerve pain and now a 6 day steroid pack because my left side became absolutely useless with crushing pain. 

I was told I‚Äôd lose my arm, I was told permanent damage, I have muscle atrophy in my forearm. I have done all the tests (emg, ct scans, X-rays, etc.) based on my emg I have issues starting with my brachial plexus and will be seeing another top end surgeon in a few weeks for a 2nd opinion.

With my at home research I‚Äôve been taking alpha lipoic acid, b, d, and magnesium vitamins which seem to be most beneficial for nerve function. My hand seems to be coming back but soooo slow. My diet is healthy with lean protein, greens, veggies (carrots, tomatoes, green beans, salmon, and some carbs)

My clinical question is, is there anything further I should be doing? I know the longer you wait to fix these problems the harder it is to get function back. Should I be seeing a hand specialist? Should I seek out surgery? I almost had surgery because they thought it might be compartment syndrome but was ruled out not necessary. I just want my hand function back at this point as it has extremely affected my quality of life.

The holidays.  And that means family dinners, with the usual uncomfortable topics that cause the usual arguments.  Drumpf, Sleepy Joe, Harris, immigration, race, other political topics and ages old family disputes that your relatives can't let go of.  There's probably another topic that gets brought up : why aren't you in a relationship?  

Well, unless you like the bigger gals, you're kinda outta luck.  And, when I tried to explain this to my relatives, I would usually get incorrect advice with a sprinkle of casual racism.  (For the record, I'm Asian.  Could care less what you call me but inaccurate stereotypes hurts the person who holds them the most)

**Bad advice #1 - It's only old people that are fat.  Young people are fit** 

https://preview.redd.it/j3oio9nwl34e1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a286f4497299ea18b3f8e81e06de647435e3685

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm) 

As seen by the graph here, that's not true.  Young people are just as bad as the older folks.  In fact, my (entirely anecdotal) experience has been that the older generations are more health conscious.  Older people grew up in a less stressful environment.  They also have more money and free time to look after themselves.  My friends at my age are chugging monsters or Diet Mountain Dews (srs, this isnt a JD Vance or LDR reference) every morning.  When I went to his parent's house, they gave me the choice between oat milk and almond milk with my coffee üòÇ 

**Bad advice #2 - Just avoid certain groups**

https://preview.redd.it/e27bzgqem34e1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea79aba44430e8b054db8f78ff8aa6ac2da23d80

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm) 

Now, the numbers aren't that much different overall.  We can disregard the Asian number because they're such a small group of the population, but as an Asian American let me assure you we're catching up in the weight olympics.  Also consider that Black Americans face challenges such as food deserts and poverty, and yet the other groups aren't that far behind.  This is an **American** problem, broadly, not a moral failing of a specific demographic.   **Don't listen to the prejudiced advice of people who don't know better.**  

**Bad advice #3 - You should have looked during college**

https://preview.redd.it/inw2seqtn34e1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7eb8acd8c6602fcd7a2c5e9048cdfc6bdd0b34c

[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm)

I mean, the numbers are still pretty bad.  Technically, this holds true.  But it reminds me of a a car club buddy's legal issues.  His lawyer knocked the sentence down from 30 days to 2 months probation.  But the charges that will increase his insurance rates still stuck.  And, his driver's license is gone for half a year.  Did it improve?  Yes, but going from you're toast to you're toast but here is a small concession isn't great.  

**Bad advice #4 - Move to a different state**

https://preview.redd.it/935gs9zoo34e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb627bf480c4758a2d9c09d9186cdc0d9f0e3fae

[https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-u-s-obesity-rates-by-state/#google\_vignette](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-u-s-obesity-rates-by-state/#google_vignette)

The point is the same as #3.  

I mean, your lawyer can save you from jail and get you probation.  Paying 50% more for insurance sucks though.  Having your brother drive you to work is embarrassing.  As someone with enough run ins, or rather, run aways from the law : Keep it on the track.  A lawyer can only do so much.  ",2,1733000117.0,itsthatbad,6,1.0,False

But it wasn‚Äôt just us and the sun; the birds had gathered too, on the trees and the cabins and the shores.

From out of the pines men carried a figure: a clumsy graceful thing. They held its white robes so it didn‚Äôt walk, but rested on their arms. Though, it tried to walk, much too slow and strokes much too wide. When it got to the lake it kept up those strides. It danced over top that glassy fire, not even a ripple to whisper a footstep.

They asked if anyone had faith enough to follow. The first walked halfway before the waters gave way. The second passed the first as he thrashed. The second made it all the way to those white robes, but as it held her face the waters took her too.

We fell upon the ground. We wept. We danced. We cried out in praise. A miracle. We were terrified.

Too enraptured to notice, I think we worshiped as they drowned.

After graduating High School I had two competing aspirations. Growing up in the church I felt I had some obligation to go into ministry. After all, all my role models worked or volunteered at the Church. But, I also wanted to be a journalist. Not only was I passionate about the truth, but the excitement of getting out of this town and getting paid to do it seemed too good to be true. Being a missionary seemed like a good compromise. I would still get to see the world and win souls for Jesus all at the same time.

It was around that time the Pastor of my small town Church gave a sermon on synchronicity. But, my pastor didn‚Äôt talk about synchronicity in the same way Carl Jung did. He called them little miracles. He said they were the Holy Spirit whispering his will into reality from just beyond our perception. He said that if we listened carefully, sometimes those whispers were clear signs; clear instructions about what God wanted from us. He gave examples about how he'd get a feeling he needed to pray for someone, then he‚Äôd ask what they needed prayer for only to find out some tragedy had just befallen them.

He said the same day he‚Äôd been asked to resign from another Church, an old friend from seminary called him about a job opportunity at this Church. He went on to minister here for almost 17 years. He said it was a clear instruction from God, and the proof was his long successful work here.¬†

In my state of unease, unsure about what to do with my life after High School, the idea that God would give me a clear sign about what to do with my life for the next two decades was about the most appealing thing someone could tell me. After the sermon I asked if I could meet him for coffee the next day to talk about my future. He was more than happy to oblige.¬†

Growing up in the youth group this was nothing new. I‚Äôd cherished these kinds of talks. He was like an uncle, or close family friend. Not just to me, but to most of the kids at the Church. He was always at our games and our plays. He helped coach the soccer team. He always sent our families cards on Christmas. In fact, he sent everyone in the church birthday, Christmas, and get well soon cards.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Small town pastor taking an interest in a young boy. I assure you it was nothing like that. His interest in myself and the other kids was nothing but wholesome. He took a hard stance on maintaining healthy boundaries even when parents stopped feeling the need for them. We weren‚Äôt allowed to be at the office with him unless someone else was in the building and his door was open. He was even the one to suggest the Church get cameras so that no volunteers or staff could ever really be with kids unsupervised. He always told us to be wary, to never isolate ourselves with someone we didn‚Äôt know, especially authority figures.

The next day I met him at the Church. When my presence pulled him out of his study he laughed, made some jokes about always being a week behind on his sermon, and told the receptionist he‚Äôd be back in an hour or so. He texted my Mom I‚Äôd arrived and we walked around the block to the coffee shop.

Once we sat down, I told him all my concerns. Just talking to someone so eager to listen made the torrent of my adolescent thoughts a little clearer. He told me he‚Äôd felt similarly at my age, that my parents probably did too and that I should tell them everything I told him. But, what excited me most was what he showed me.

He pulled up an email on his computer from earlier that day. It was a newsletter containing an advertisement for a year long missionary boot camp out in Oregon. It boasted training that would equip young adults with all the skills they needed to be successful as a missionary, as well as connecting kids with full time positions all over the world. They just wanted $500 dollars for room and board for the whole year, and promised your money back if we couldn‚Äôt land a job.

That price point seemed too good to be true. Looking back on it I guess that‚Äôs part of the trap. Get rid of your kids for long and for cheap. You can even be proud of them too.¬†

He told me normally he‚Äôd be suspicious of these kinds of programs, that they could be well meaning but misguided. He said it‚Äôs easy to get high on emotions on these kinds of trips, to lose track of truth, to see God where he isn‚Äôt. But, given the subject matter of his last sermon, everything I‚Äôd told him about wanting to be a missionary, and the timing of the email, he thought it may be whispers from God. I asked him to forward it to my mom. He did.

And simple as that, I joined a cult. It‚Äôs ironic: I think growing up in such a good church blinded me and my parents to the signs.

After arriving in Oregon with swathes of other bright eyed kids we were greeted by so many vibrant and passionate adults, blue skies, green hills and fluffy clouds. I‚Äôd never seen so many trees; I‚Äôd never met so many happy people. I thought it looked like Heaven. We played get to know you games with staff so earnest and eager. We sang songs and prayed until the sun went down and into the night. I think we were all tired, but I couldn‚Äôt tell; the positive energy charged the air and kept us animated.

It must‚Äôve been 1am by the time they started telling us the rules. First, they told us basic stuff about respectful behavior, boys sticking with boys and girls sticking with girls. Then they took our phones, assuring us we‚Äôd get them back later. This was to cut down on distractions so we could focus on God. They told us our group leaders were in charge of us, and that we couldn‚Äôt go anywhere without letting them know. This was for our safety. Then they divided us into groups, assigned us counselors, put us in vans, and sent us into the woods. We were already far too tired and in love to see the red flags. I never did get that phone back.

I had the privilege of riding with the program director: a silver haired man full of life and passion. He asked me all about my home, my family, and my hobbies. I‚Äôd never seen a man his age fake interest in video games so well. I was reading Matthew 14 in that van to impress him. When he saw, he mentioned that was the chapter Jesus walked on water. He told me God had so many good plans for this year, that God was so happy I‚Äôd come. He told me I was in the right place. Coming from someone like him, who seemed to know exactly what God wanted, who seemed to love me so much, those words were power. I was in the right place.

But I wasn‚Äôt, because that next morning it wasn‚Äôt God out on that lake.",3,1732999708.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

We got together to go to a scenic area and practice tarot reading, then this unfolded into many coffee dates, going to the beach a couple times, a festival together out of state, with a long year of covid interrupting things, etc. I was the one to quickly offer to drive, the one to make plans most often, we both had our anxious times where we'd back out and cancel due to mental health fluctuations over the years as we grew into our mid twenties. So we were friends from about 22-27 years old, HUGE changes happening in each year of growth. I went through a long 3 years or so of a spiritual awakening that taught me so much. I then put it all up to the universe and let go, fully ready to accept anything that was meant for me and not try to force myself to be loved after 2 big heart breaks within about 3 months of eachother. (I fell in love really fast with someone just about a month after a relationship,  crazy story I'll write later) 
So Lee had invited me to go see a mutual friends band play, and a whole group of friends were going. So I went even though I was having a hard time accepting it was time to date other people and move on. A mutual friend who sat with us, and is bff's with Lee's boyfriend asked me for my number. We were FWB for a year, dated for 1.5 years, then got engaged 2 weeks ago!! 
Anyways, idk how to stay on track & my mind is swirling. So we moved away after a year of dating, across the county. It was (is) so hard to face the fact that my bff's that I introduced to each other get to see each other constantly and are close now when I leave. This also made communication so hard, they all are dating someone so that takes up most of their time and social life, they also have problems texting often, from what I understand its not preferred of a way to be friends which I agree with long distance sucks and I love hangout in person. They also are neurodivergent and the livestyle their always feels like a force to do tons of things constantly while there's a couple months of warmth in the summer. 
So it's 10 months into living very far away, I haven't even visited home yet. I've had 2 of 4 of my bff's visit, no family. Meanwhile my fiance is always playing games online with friends, has had like 8 visitors, and is constantly texting talking about everything with is friends which made me believe it's totally possible. Also they are neurodivergent. Maybe the difference is guys like being on their phone more and me and the girls like crying and dancing together in person, telling secrets face to face while holding hands and sharing snacks- it's the best! 
The entire year I am so anxious and annoyed with Lee, so many mixed feelings. They actually got diagnosed with autism a year ago in late September I think. A couple months after I remember them mentioning this and hernot wanting to say anything. When it came down to talking about it it was vague so how I remember it we didnt say much but I said I have open arms and space to support her when she's ready. I also was trying to plan my birthday trip a couple states away (about 1.5 hour drive) to a favorite city, or going to a concert that I squealed and sent to her because we had individual amazing experiences discovering this artist at a really young age. She soon after backed out of both plans, not exactly saying why. I cried so confused and just wishing she was okay and I could be with her to support her. Selfishly I did want to be that friend she went to be I thought maybe she was to her others just not me and we werent that close anymore. This sounds super immature of me, I know, and I will admit it is, as the following. But it came from love, although the problems arrise because it did not come off as love when I closed myself off and slowly inched away. I had noticed every time we had any conversation it was from myself promoting it after we had moved away. So I waited to see if she even asked if I was doing well or anything, our sn.ap score never held up long, we tried sending video recordings on sn.ap to ease the stress of phone calls that for some reason gives me so much anxiety when it comes to friends, we tried sending a notebook back and forth with letters but only did it a couple times, cute apps that didn't get used much, etc. 
I started counting up all the things that didn't go well over the year and noticed we hadn't been very close. We had small moments. 
Back to the birthday planning part, so end of last year ( after diagnosis, prior to us moving ) I was so stressed telling everyone we were moving, working an hour away from my friances house making for long days with a terribly organized work place & difficult boss, packing to move from my friends house to his place, and facing relationship trauma by dating again which sent me into cptsd episodes constantly. Fight or flight always. I honestly feel like I was beginning to fall apart at this time now that I look back. Even tho good things were happening to us I was so stressed and focused on them I forgot to keep in touch with my spiritual side to keep grounded and sooth my anxiety and have a level mindset. I quickly will loose myself when I'm stuck in my own thoughts it's been life long of trying to calm myself from the inside out in this way. So Lee says something along the lines of needing to do other plans soon around my birthday party planed weekend that will prevent her from going. My fiance then one evening comes to me and says "" I know why she isn't going.. *boyfriend* just told me that they are going out of state the following weekend and that's why"" so this tied in with her falling apart from her diagnosis was the reason and she never flat out said either. I was upset to find this out through others. That weekend of my birthday she then went to the concert that her and I had talked about going to. I found this out by seeing her sn.ap story while in the hotel out of state with a group of friends. It immediately ended my night, I felt sad and confused. According to the guys, the night was arranged because Lee's boyfriend convinced her it would be good to get out and do something she loves, she went with her other bff and then they got to go home comfortably after. The concert and the hotel were in different areas but the same distance away from home. I had come to believe being away from home was an issue because there was a time she wouldn't drive anywhere in paralyzing fear, even as a passenger. So the entire end of the last year we live in the same state, she doesn't visit me. Until the NYE party that doubled as the going away party. She did make effort to try to get together ""for my birthday"" although It seemed it would be a time to talk about my frustrations with her not coming to my birthday party and I was 4 weeks away from doing the biggest thing ever (moving across the country) and did not even have the energy to cook or do much outside of work to save money and relaxing events. So I just hungout with people who made full efforts and were a breath of fresh air to be around. 
Flash forward to 3 weeks ago, I had gotten in my head quite a bit, noticing we had hardly talked, I didn't know much about her anymore, or who she became in the last year at all. I felt it naturally shifted and I kept telling myself I need to move on, accept it as it is, that I probably won't have closure as I mourn this close phase of our friendship ending. We used to live together for a couple months when she needed a safe space, we cried together, would sit together on bad days, id drive us to the beach, we'd sing together in the car parking lot for hours, so low maintenance but only if I show up to her or reach out to her. This could be a factor that is heavily affected by her autism although I am worried it was also just a lack of effort because I have other friends the same diagnosis, but it also has a wide range of outcomes I understand. It was very close for about 4 years. Starting out way back in 2019 when we would sit and text back and forth massive paragraphs on topics of spirituality, growing up, the universes mysteries, anything out of the boring normal, we'd spend so much time formulation huge conversations through text. So why did this fade out when we have been the same people this whole time, does she not perfer it or find it exhausting now? My worst fears and my victim mentality sadly got the best of me and said that I'm a bad friend so that's why she couldn't come to me in her time of change and pain, and that I'm not worth the same efforts she used to put in. I still enjoy texting that much, so I'm confused. My mom is always playing poor me, the victim, & slowly fades away in silence when she doesn't feel valued or is upset. I sadly had resorted back to this manorism that I inherited, I had unlearned it and spoke my mind, and held space for myself when I had learned in my awakening, although the outer stress of the year took my eyes off of myself and continued self growth. So I feel into old habits and I am so embarrassed and ashamed. But I also am so glad that it only took about 4 days for me to notice this and take a serious look at how I hold myself and talk to myself internally, I have woken up again.
So with my birthday plans I was so upset, I just let it be and had other things to quickly finish before moving. The NYE party came around and my other bff pushed us together, we stood in the center of a very loud full house and I poured tears expressing how I felt I wasn't a close friend enough to be able to hear and support what she was going through and literally asked if I wasa bad friend. She disagreed and still didn't really tell me what was going on. For some reason I craved a clear answer so badly. 
Last week I went back home the first time, and my bff and I talked about things a lot, and this topic of how Lee and I fell off came up a lot. I said I'd be open to talking although she cut the friendship off so I don't see myself welcome to, and I'm just grateful I've learned, have relief, and can move forward because I mourned all year, almost making my own bed I guess, because if I wasn't so negative In my head it probably wouldnt have ended. I got to a point I felt weird she'd see my posts on the bff shared story and she didn't know anything further than that about me or ask how I was, and I didn't know much about her but had tried to strike up conversation in text a few times before noticing it fails over and over. And even when I mentioned it was a missed message, the messages we're replied to, excuses were made about being chaotic and busy with a fun new life hobbies / life style. So I felt so ignored. I un added her from the sn.ap group. She noticed after a couple days. Another immature move. Because If I was thinking with my clear healed mind and not my old programming, I would have realized I need to have enough self love to have a conversation to get this cleared up rather than being upset and crying and mourning for the entirety of the year we hadn't been close, purely from the shear shock of hour our friendship went from a constant, #1 bff's of eachother, easy going, comfortable, long conversations, efforts, you name it, to hardly gets a response even with 3 texts within a week or so of time, 2 calls in a year, & not ever asking how life is even though for me it so drastically changed. Moving across the country is not easy, it's so hard. And 10 months in i still have waves of stress because every event place is new, every friend is still fresh, it's so constant of new and hard. But it's all perspective and this is a dream fulfilled of mine. 
So I un added her from the chat. Suddenly she's so quick to message me and we go back and forth texting ( another immature move ) for 4 hours. It fades out, I feel okay but so confused, we had 3 topics going on at one time for the entire time and so much got confused, multiple times she thought I said one response to something else she sent as a newer message and thought I was saying something rudely when I was thinking before responding and I started saying let's get on the phone. But didn't. Biggest mistake. I should know this very well by this age. But it's okay we're always learning and growing. 
Then that day ends, I call out of work the next day completely exhausted and needing to ignore the world. I was in tears so obviously didn't feel right. I message her the next day saying I feel I needed to hear an apology for not letting me know why she wouldn't come to my birthday party and just communting the truth instead of walking around it because I had to find out through others or in the moment by her videos posted. She thought I wanted an apology for her not knowing how to speak about the turmoil of the diagnosis that turned her life upsidown. This is not what I wanted, I felt terrible it shifted everything for her and had he confused and lost and hurt. I wanted to be there for her. 
My bff when I visited my home state again, told me a story she hadnt told anyone about SA that had happened about 4 years ago or some time a while ago, she broke down in tears reliving it for a moment, and she said she didn't know how to tell anyone about this for so long, and was not conscious when it happened and for a week after so she didn't know it even happened to her for over half a year. Anyways, this opened my eyes so much, that sometimes people go through things and don't know how to talk about it. I open up so much that I personally can't relate to this much, other than I guess when I was hiding my abusive relationships from people, I never knew how to talk about those. I also didn't realize what was happening or how bad it was, I think this is similar in my bff's situation years ago, and Lee's situation with her diagnosis last year. 
I have realized my mistakes, counted up my important lessons to be learned, and then also realized this was a huge awakening to myself again, back to being in touch with me. Learning to love myself again, esp in the way of speaking up when I am upset about something.
 In that first day of 4 hours of texting Lee she had mentioned the past year she had because of her diagnosis, been trying to learn and better her skills of communicating and definitely say right away when something is upsetting. So I was like yes absolutely I love this, I should have done this so many months ago, and apologized for closing down. She offered to have face time calls and play games, I admitted I wasn't ready to jump back into things this had been heavy for a while it needs time to process everything. 
The day off went by where I rested, then when I said I wanted an apology for something specific and that I felt we should still have a call, she initially responded within a couple hours and said yes, then proceed to send a very long message about many details of things and that's the opposite of what I wanted I wanted it to be on the phone. A whole work day, and a work outing goes by, I was drinking so I decide it's best to reply the next day. I set up my day nicely then when I am free for a moment and can mentally handle reading the messages I read that first one saying yes to a call, and a second one that is very long where she says she is done with our friendship. I had told my (other) bff that we were having awkward conversations and that it should probably be known by her because I was staying at her house when visiting my home state, and if she was invited over at the end of a night out that could be awkward esp if she wasn't prev aware we are a little off lately. 

Little did I know my fiance had put her in a group chat along with 2 of my other bff's to plan my purposal during this trip. 

She hardly contributed he had said in the end, which isn't like her. She's very creative and crafty, usually so overly excited and positive. My other 2 bff's were the ones there and fully involved. 
I'm not sure if my comment telling my bff, who works with Lee and told her, that I thought it would be awkward and don't really want her invited to her house, then decided to call off our friendship because of the not being able to be at the surprise engagement also. I had no idea it was going to happen. The ring was with us on the plane and everything but I thought it would be something that happened next year, not 3 months after we first talked about marriage together. 

In my eyes it's not a bff to cut someone of approx 5 years out just before their engagement, and not get on the phone. I was called manipulative and hot and cold for not wanting to immediately jump into being close with video call double date nights and games, etc. We had so much updating to do on each others lives, I don't even know how this year has been to her or changed her hardly at all. I wanted to talk more about her diagnosis. Tons of things. But felt sick every time I wanted to reach out and I knew I wasn't ever going to have her be able to / put in effort to visit me, or talk to me much even. 

I later realized that it was none of my business her hard time with her diagnosis, she didn't know how to talk about it and sometimes it's just simply that way. I've noticed now moments where that had happened in other friendships, about 3 times or so even. I took it personally this time, I thought we were attached at the hip. I didn't understand how this friendship could have changed so so fast. Others shifted and changed over the years for sure, I don't live with any friends I once did, I'm mature in ways I wasn't, I have learned many things, I also have messed up and had awkward times where I had to try to vocalize it and it fixed and smoothed out, esp since this falling out. I immediately tried to vocalize still having a bad gut feeling with Lee, she I was right in my gut things were trying to be brushed over because she did think I was being so rude and I wanted to get on the phone so she could hear my tone of voice is anything but passive aggressive and rude to her, I had so much love for her. I just can't know everything that's going on with everyone and honestly that's weird and confusing at times. Like we all experience life so so differently. 
So I realized I need to not have such a personal hurt reaction when people just don't know how to speak about something. I think I was triggered because I was that friend in middle school who was so religious and goody goody that no one told me anything, they'd tell my sister before me because I'd cry if they told me they s m o k e d or something like that. So I was triggered in many ways, had some old bad habits/ programming sneak up. And I'm so thankful for that hard work I've put in showing up in smalls ways to at least show me this in my actions, even when I made mistakes. I don't told onto it angrily and store it. I've felt through it and learned and leveled up spirituallt again. ",1,1732999604.0,AITAH,0,0.67,False

I‚Äôm a big fan of RDT (Ross Droplet Technique) as a means to reduce static build up in coffee grounds, however, I began to notice some rusting / pitting / flaking of the chrome finish on the Niche Zero hopper that I acquired earlier this year. 

I emailed Niche and they responded same day saying they would ship out a new chrome hopper and I got it a few days later. I was extremely impressed with their customer service and love that the company did this even though it was probably my fault as a customer. I‚Äôm going to send them these pictures so they can warn customers. 

For extra context, the water that I use in the RDT bottle sprayer is tap water and fairly hard (180ppm). Does anyone think this could have contributed to the corrosion on the chrome on the NZ? Should I no longer do RDT or switch to distilled water for RDT? 

Hope this helps anyone out who uses RDT and the NZ or any other chrome plated grinder. ",14,1732999466.0,espresso,17,0.82,False

1h3lupq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1h3lupq/day_17_improving_benefits/,Day 17 (improving / benefits),"So for some context, I think what's been helping me recently is the fact before I overdosed on caffeine (500-400+ mg, which for my body was a shock since I never drink caffeine), I was never a caffeine user. I wouldn't even call myself a moderate caffeine drinker honestly, it was like a cup of coffee maybe every few weeks or something.

That being said, I would say my body is sensitive, and I've definitely gone through hell the past few weeks, it really felt like my symptoms were never ending.

\- Seeing floaties at night

\- Palpitations

\- Panic attacks

\- Intense tremors

\- Tachycardia

\- Nausea / Dizziness / Lightheadedness

\- Borderline Agoraphobia (I have not been able to leave my house for a little while)

\- Super sensitive to stimulation (noise / bright lights)

\- Headaches 

etc

As hard as all of this has been, I've been told that while my symptoms have been pretty acute especially towards the beginning, the length of my withdrawal will probably look different than most people (since everyone recovers differently). With all of that out of the way, I wanted to note some benefits I have seen, especially since I've been blessed with some pretty good days during recovery (especially more as of recent, but still not 100 percent)

\- More gratitude for just being alive / daily functioning

\- Better focus before my overdose (probably cause I've had to live lower stimulation for awhile now)

\- Eating better (I don't really have a choice lol, if you want to recover faster you have to treat your body well)

\- Better habits

\- Succumbing control and becoming more patient

\- MORE GRATITUDE FOR LITERALLY EVERYTHING

\- More motivation / ideas after withdrawal etc

This has been one of the toughest things I've ever gone through honestly. That being said, being aware of how so many people have been struggling and that I'm not alone in my symptoms has been comforting. I am not out of the storm just quite yet but the clarity I've been getting as of the past week has been eye opening.",5,1732999314.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I had my back towards the door as i was making coffee in my office and someone walked in (who i presumed was my friend). We have an inside joke where we tell mean things to each other without meaning it so i just told him to kill himself (we both find this hilarious).

To my surprise it was not my friend who walked in but a patient who had been struggling with suicidal thoughts. I immediately tried to apologise to her but she already ran off crying. This was all 2 weeks ago and no one has heard from her since. Not even her family. I dont know what happened to her but i feel guilty and dont know what to do.",0,1732998706.0,offmychest,2,0.44,False

1h3lhx5,https://i.redd.it/of3tbmfrl34e1.jpeg,Can‚Äôt pull a good espresso.,"Hey guys, I picked this gaggia classic up from a Salvation Army store for $15.

I tested it, all lights worked and looked like a goer.
Left it in my apartment for a few weeks and now has come the first use.

The temperature light won‚Äôt turn on. I think I can audibly hear the temp relay clicking, but I‚Äôm unfamiliar with these systems so it‚Äôs hard to say.

I can‚Äôt get the machine to pull any crema, although I‚Äôm a newbie in the artisan coffee industry I am aware of grind size (I grind to a medium) and the importance of matching this with tamp pressure ETC.

I feel like the machine just isn‚Äôt building enough pressure. Is this to do with the heat not being up high enough ? Or is it most likely a faulty light and I just combat this by tamping harder ? I‚Äôm trying my hardest to figure it out verbally rather than opening the machine up and fault finding.

I hope my lack of vernacular doesent offend as I really am not trying to impress anyone, I just really wanna know why it‚Äôs so hard to make a good espresso with this machine. My sunbeam will always pull a good shot even without tamping AT All.

Appreciate you guys !!!",1,1732998335.0,gaggiaclassic,11,0.6,False

1h3lgzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1h3lgzw/help_us_find_the_perfect_adult_all_inclusive/,Help us find the perfect adult all inclusive Cancun area please,"This is my first time posting here, glad to have found this sub! I have checked out the amazing pinned spreadsheet, but am looking for some advice for a November 2025 adults only trip with my husband. We have been to the Cancun area a few times and like it, would like to return but having a hard time narrowing down. Here‚Äôs what we are looking for:
4 nights at the beginning of November for our birthdays, Cancun/Riviera Maya that whole area within reasonable distance to airport. 

Vibes: We are low-key and spend most of our time finding different spots to relax, read a book, and have some drinks. We love enjoying morning coffee, taking long walks on property or along a beach, and going to a spa. We wouldn‚Äôt likely leave the property but may be open to SUP or kayak or cultural classes, but not a must do. We are both introverts so we like our privacy. We are not looking for a party scene, and don‚Äôt care about whether there is nightlife available. We also don‚Äôt care about having a swimmable ocean, just looking at it is good enough for us. 

Room: in a perfect world we want to be in a swim up room or have our own plunge pool or hot tub but we would sacrifice the room category for other aspects like food, atmosphere, or service. 

Budget: Ideally I don‚Äôt want to spend more than $1k per night, but may be able to stretch slightly above for the right place. If we have to choose between room category or food, I‚Äôd rather have a lower class room and better food. 

We have stayed at Secrets Akumal, but had higher expectations for the food. We heard great things about it but ended up feeling like it was sub-par. Maybe we have too high expectations for AI food, but this is our top priority and we would even be willing to go to a lower class room category and sacrifice for better food and drinks. 

The ones that I have come across so far that may work for us that I‚Äôm looking for input on are: 
Xcaret Arte Adult section - I‚Äôm worried we would be paying for excursions that we probably wouldn‚Äôt use, but if everything else checks the boxes does that matter?
Grand Velas- I think there‚Äôs an adult section? But may be a little too family oriented, and it‚Äôs in the higher end of our budget. Is it worth the splurge? 
Atelier Playa Mujeres- higher end of budget, is it worth it given the other options? 
Impressions Moxche- is the food better or the same as Akumal? 
Unico 2087- heard good things a while ago but has it held up? Is it more of a party/social scene? 
Excellence Playa Mujeres- one of the cheaper options for our dates which has me suspicious that the quality and service won‚Äôt meet our expectations. ",1,1732998264.0,AllInclusiveResorts,11,0.67,False

1h3lepu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3lepu/the_devil_died_on_a_cross_out_in_oregon_part_2/,The Devil Died On A Cross Out In Oregon (Part 2),"I saw my first miracle on the pebbly shores of that placid lake painted orange by the watching sun. But it wasn‚Äôt just us and the sun; the birds had gathered too, on the trees and the cabins and the shores.

From out of the pines men carried a figure: a clumsy graceful thing. They held its white robes so it didn‚Äôt walk, but rested on their arms. Though, it tried to walk, much too slow and strokes much too wide. When it got to the lake it kept up those strides. It danced over top that glassy fire, not even a ripple to whisper a footstep.

They asked if anyone had faith enough to follow. The first walked halfway before the waters gave way. The second passed the first as he thrashed. The second made it all the way to those white robes, but as it held her face the waters took her too.

We fell upon the ground. We wept. We danced. We cried out in praise. A miracle. We were terrified.

Too enraptured to notice, I think we worshiped as they drowned.

After graduating High School I had two competing aspirations. Growing up in the church I felt I had some obligation to go into ministry. After all, all my role models worked or volunteered at the Church. But, I also wanted to be a journalist. Not only was I passionate about the truth, but the excitement of getting out of this town and getting paid to do it seemed too good to be true. Being a missionary seemed like a good compromise. I would still get to see the world and win souls for Jesus all at the same time.

It was around that time the Pastor of my small town Church gave a sermon on synchronicity. But, my pastor didn‚Äôt talk about synchronicity in the same way Carl Jung did. He called them little miracles. He said they were the Holy Spirit whispering his will into reality from just beyond our perception. He said that if we listened carefully, sometimes those whispers were clear signs; clear instructions about what God wanted from us. He gave examples about how he'd get a feeling he needed to pray for someone, then he‚Äôd ask what they needed prayer for only to find out some tragedy had just befallen them.

He said the same day he‚Äôd been asked to resign from another Church, an old friend from seminary called him about a job opportunity at this Church. He went on to minister here for almost 17 years. He said it was a clear instruction from God, and the proof was his long successful work here.¬†

In my state of unease, unsure about what to do with my life after High School, the idea that God would give me a clear sign about what to do with my life for the next two decades was about the most appealing thing someone could tell me. After the sermon I asked if I could meet him for coffee the next day to talk about my future. He was more than happy to oblige.¬†

Growing up in the youth group this was nothing new. I‚Äôd cherished these kinds of talks. He was like an uncle, or close family friend. Not just to me, but to most of the kids at the Church. He was always at our games and our plays. He helped coach the soccer team. He always sent our families cards on Christmas. In fact, he sent everyone in the church birthday, Christmas, and get well soon cards.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Small town pastor taking an interest in a young boy. I assure you it was nothing like that. His interest in myself and the other kids was nothing but wholesome. He took a hard stance on maintaining healthy boundaries even when parents stopped feeling the need for them. We weren‚Äôt allowed to be at the office with him unless someone else was in the building and his door was open. He was even the one to suggest the Church get cameras so that no volunteers or staff could ever really be with kids unsupervised. He always told us to be wary, to never isolate ourselves with someone we didn‚Äôt know, especially authority figures.

The next day I met him at the Church. When my presence pulled him out of his study he laughed, made some jokes about always being a week behind on his sermon, and told the receptionist he‚Äôd be back in an hour or so. He texted my Mom I‚Äôd arrived and we walked around the block to the coffee shop.

Once we sat down, I told him all my concerns. Just talking to someone so eager to listen made the torrent of my adolescent thoughts a little clearer. He told me he‚Äôd felt similarly at my age, that my parents probably did too and that I should tell them everything I told him. But, what excited me most was what he showed me.

He pulled up an email on his computer from earlier that day. It was a newsletter containing an advertisement for a year long missionary boot camp out in Oregon. It boasted training that would equip young adults with all the skills they needed to be successful as a missionary, as well as connecting kids with full time positions all over the world. They just wanted $500 dollars for room and board for the whole year, and promised your money back if we couldn‚Äôt land a job.

That price point seemed too good to be true. Looking back on it I guess that‚Äôs part of the trap. Get rid of your kids for long and for cheap. You can even be proud of them too.¬†

He told me normally he‚Äôd be suspicious of these kinds of programs, that they could be well meaning but misguided. He said it‚Äôs easy to get high on emotions on these kinds of trips, to lose track of truth, to see God where he isn‚Äôt. But, given the subject matter of his last sermon, everything I‚Äôd told him about wanting to be a missionary, and the timing of the email, he thought it may be whispers from God. I asked him to forward it to my mom. He did.

And simple as that, I joined a cult. It‚Äôs ironic: I think growing up in such a good church blinded me and my parents to the signs.

After arriving in Oregon with swathes of other bright eyed kids we were greeted by so many vibrant and passionate adults, blue skies, green hills and fluffy clouds. I‚Äôd never seen so many trees; I‚Äôd never met so many happy people. I thought it looked like Heaven. We played get to know you games with staff so earnest and eager. We sang songs and prayed until the sun went down and into the night. I think we were all tired, but I couldn‚Äôt tell; the positive energy charged the air and kept us animated.

It must‚Äôve been 1am by the time they started telling us the rules. First, they told us basic stuff about respectful behavior, boys sticking with boys and girls sticking with girls. Then they took our phones, assuring us we‚Äôd get them back later. This was to cut down on distractions so we could focus on God. They told us our group leaders were in charge of us, and that we couldn‚Äôt go anywhere without letting them know. This was for our safety. Then they divided us into groups, assigned us counselors, put us in vans, and sent us into the woods. We were already far too tired and in love to see the red flags. I never did get that phone back.

I had the privilege of riding with the program director: a silver haired man full of life and passion. He asked me all about my home, my family, and my hobbies. I‚Äôd never seen a man his age fake interest in video games so well. I was reading Matthew 14 in that van to impress him. When he saw, he mentioned that was the chapter Jesus walked on water. He told me God had so many good plans for this year, that God was so happy I‚Äôd come. He told me I was in the right place. Coming from someone like him, who seemed to know exactly what God wanted, who seemed to love me so much, those words were power. I was in the right place.

But I wasn‚Äôt, because that next morning it wasn‚Äôt God out on that lake.",3,1732998090.0,nosleep,2,0.81,False

Is it worth giving him another chance?,"I never had a relationship before but I met a guy in a very unexpected way a few days ago on the bus, we talked a lot and before we said goodbye he asked for my number. He seemed nice and I enjoyed talking to him so I gave him my number and we met a day later for a coffee and a walk. However, while we walked, he tried to kiss me and I pushed him away telling him that I wasn‚Äôt ready and I preferred to wait. Honestly, I barely know him and above all, I never had my first kiss so I wanted to take things slow. He said he understood so we kept walking and talking but half an hour later he told me that he wanted to try to kiss me again. I didn‚Äôt even had the chance to say something that he got close to me, kissed me passionately and then moved to my neck and started kissing it too. At that point I pushed him away saying that it was enough. 

That was basically my first kiss but I didn‚Äôt tell him. I didn‚Äôt even like it and I didn‚Äôt feel anything. To be honest, I barely got the chance to get to know him, we talked about this and that but I‚Äôm confused about his intentions. He messaged me the day after asking how the date went and I told him that I thought that the kiss was unnecessary because it was our first date and we barely knew each other. He told me that we can stay friends but I‚Äôm just very confused. I‚Äôve never had a relationship before and I don‚Äôt know if I should just risk it and give him another chance or end things completely. What he did made me uncomfortable so I‚Äôm a bit worried about his intentions and goals, if I have to be honest. I have a lot of things going on right now so I really don‚Äôt know what to do. At the same time, a part of me wants to have this new experience but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs the right person for me right now. I‚Äôm very sensitive and what happened triggered my anxiety. I don‚Äôt know if giving him another chance is the right thing to do. He was nice to talk to I guess but the way he kissed me makes me think that he has specific intentions and I don‚Äôt know if I should see him again.

Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links) the case, its being offered free, which frees ~100 to spend on other parts. Also have a 4k and a 1080p dial monitor setup.

PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) gaming, mostly in VR, but im also an indie game dev so rendering etc.

Purchase country? Near Micro Center? USA, not near a microcenter

Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate) no

Budget range? (Include tax considerations)
Under 2000$ please, at most. If i can spend less without taking major performance hits, thats obviously preferred. 


WiFi or wired connection? Wifi

Size/noise constraints? Nope

Color/lighting preferences? I could not care less about how it looks

Any other specific needs?

I just really dont want anything to do with AMD right now - my last pc was all AMD stuff and the software crashed constantly, would fail to update, etc.

A pretty good first lunch but I have had better versions of everything we got. Loads of crawfish in their √©touff√©e but it wasn't packed with enough flavor imo. Gumbo was better but not quite there. Overall, everything was just alright, especially for the price.

The good: Service was fantastic. They really went above and beyond to make our anniversary dinner special including bringing out free apps and dessert. Wonderful, attentive service. Great martinis.

The bad: The food was all just fine with the exception of their trout catch of the day which was so fishy it truly boggled the mind that this dish was being served at such a nice restaurant. We each took one bite and left the rest. Everything else was forgettable.

Damn y'all. I was most looking forward to this one but it was a bit of a let down. The tofu and fish did NOT have that numbing tingly kind of spice. We asked for everything extra spicy too (with even more chili oil on the side). All the food was tasty, but we were looking for something we don't have at home and Spicy House reaaaally reminded me of Little Chinatown in Kenner. Which is good. But I think we should have gone to Dumpling Hour a second time instead.

I can actually explain more about myself here. I've posted before but things just fizzled out after a few days.. Online communication is weird isn't it ? So yeah, I'm keepin my spirits high and up... let's give this another chance :))

I'd say I'm a funny, energetic ,sarcastic and yet chill, calm and somewhat depressive type of guy . I care about my looks, I know what I want from life, partner, work .. anything.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

I like to spend my time with loads of stuff like, having a pint with friends every now and then, going to gym 3 times a week, playing games, watching movies/series, playing guitar, reading books, lying down on the rug watching the ceiling while listening to Pink Floyd.. Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I also enjoy deep chats, philosophy and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun.. honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny LOL :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate and more than anything straightforward guy .. but as you might've guessed already those just doesn't come from the day one.. feelings are feelings because we can't control them , right ?

Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and analyse the characters ? We can read poets to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other , come up with weird jokes to see the reaction :D .. all those lovely stuff.. live in a wee village and have late nite drives together ? We can go for an ice-cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL .. We can watch true-crime or horror but don't worry I'll watch family guy with you if that's too scary :D

What I'm looking for ?

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order , who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D ) , who's loyal and who's curious about things in life.. who knows what she wants.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also love to have a coz night in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence.

Things I think could be deal-breaker for some people:

\- I'm Atheist. But I do respect to religions as long as the respect is mutual and it's not your total personality

\- Got 4 tattoos.

\- I'm originally Turkish. Turns out people care about the least important thing about me more than anything so there you go :))

Other stuff :

188cm (6 2 )tall , 90 kg (200 pounds) , fit but no abs LOL \*crying in distance\* , green eyes, caucasian, brown hair (with a blonde undertone), beard and moustache

Ultimately I'm looking for something profound, deep and love-fueled... but yeah let's start by being friends, and then let's see where we can lead it !",0,1732997465.0,r4r,1,0.5,False
1h3l6cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1h3l6cc/work_gifts_for_15_people/,Work gifts for 15 people?,"I did this to myself so I‚Äôm the only one to blame. I love giving gifts. I started with my work crew a few years ago, simple, like a can of exotic hot chocolate fancily wrapped. Then one year I did silly coffee mugs that were chosen with something really funny related to each person; filled with candy. Super-personal. (I literally bought after-Halloween candy in sales).

Now I‚Äôve been promoted. One group had been eliminated due to a work gift exchange, whew. But I still have 15 people I want to buy for. Budget is a few hundred in total. What am I not seeing that is $10-$15 a person? Can‚Äôt do lottery tickets because two people refuse to gamble. 

World Market has those orange chocolate balls but I hate that flavor. Do enough people like those? ",11,1732997456.0,Gifts,22,1.0,False

Following my posts from yesterday, as well as my original one from months ago, I‚Äôm receiving a lot of private messages from you guys wanting 1 to 1 advice.

As much as I try my best to get back to you, I‚Äôm unable to get back to everyone all at once, especially because I like to take the time to converse with you guys properly and give a through detailed response.

With that said, if you‚Äôre from the UK, I do run a manifestation group twice a month that is free and I provide complimentary tea, coffee and cupcakes! So if you‚Äôd like more details on this please leave a comment and I‚Äôll reach out.


In regards to the private messages a lot of you will experience a delay in my responses, please know I‚Äôm not ignoring you and will get back to you when I can. I‚Äôm a busy lady, and with running my email service which is a paid service I have to give my time and attention to them first and foremost, but all your questions and dilemma‚Äôs are important to me too and I will get back to you when I can.

As for the details of my email service, many of you have asked why I‚Äôve taken the post down about that and my manifestation course-it gained a lot of attention and the spots filled up almost immediately. I had to turn some people down so I removed my post to avoid any further disappointment. I have to give followers from my other platforms a chance to get an email service spot too, too keep it as fair as possible. If any spaces become available I‚Äôll get back to those on the waiting list asap. 

Thanks guys!",1,1732997431.0,u_Green-Cucumber1399,2,1.0,False
