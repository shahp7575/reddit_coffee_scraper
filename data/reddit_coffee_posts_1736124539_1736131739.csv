I’m getting married this March on the Mornington Peninsula. It’s going to be a fairly relaxed micro-wedding (less than 30 guests). The ceremony is in a pine forest overlooking the ocean, and afterward, we’re heading back to our place for a big, family-style dinner.  

I’m struggling to figure out my outfit, so I’d love your help! Here’s what I’m thinking:  

- **Shirt**: A white linen or cotton shirt—something lightweight and comfy but still looks nice.  
- **Pants**: Brown, dark brown, or maybe a coffee color? I’m torn between linen or cotton, or maybe something else entirely. I honestly have no idea what works best for the foresty style vibe  
- **Shoes**: Probably loafers, but I’m open to other ideas if they fit the laid-back yet stylish feel of the day.  

I’ve been hunting online and checking Reddit, but I’m honestly lost in what to look for. im struggling to find specific brands or shops that fit the look I’m going for. Ideally, I’d like to keep it under $300 (for everything), but I’m happy to stretch the budget a bit if needed.  

Any recommendations for websites, stores, or styles would be amazing. Bonus points for anything that ships to Australia!

Just like the title says, I need some meal/restaurant recommendations but let me give some background 1st and please pardon my ignorance. My husband and I will be going to NOLA for the 1st time mid-April during the French Quarter Fest. I am not very well traveled as I grew up very poor and have literally only been out of my beautiful state of New Mexico maybe 5 times EVER! I know...I know. I'm very accustomed to our Native & Spanish inspired cuisine here which inclides loads of Hatch green-chile. I haven't really had any other types of meals. I do love seafood, but it's hard to get real fresh seafood here in the desert. The closest we get is Pappadeaux Seafood restaurant (I do love this place albeit very expensive, so don't get to enjoy often). I also know this is a very ""chain"" restaurant with probably nothing like true New Orleans meals. I also enjoy pasta, not really into red meat (however, my husband is a meat and potatoes kinda guy). I love deserts of all kinds, and love me some bomb-a$$ coffee. None of the sweet crap served at Starbucks. My food palette is not bland but very limited in opportunities to taste other foods. Help a girl out and give me some amazing recommendations. Low cost, upscale, whatever you got. Descriptions of the flavor would be amazing.

1huopaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/punchout/comments/1huopaq/nintendo_might_dodge_punches_but_gamerant_dodges/,"“Nintendo might dodge punches, but GameRant dodges humor.”","**Original link:** [https://gamerant.com/punch-out-new-game-unlikely-dead-why/](https://gamerant.com/punch-out-new-game-unlikely-dead-why/)

**My hot take:** *“I posted this glorious Punch-Out roast on GameRant, but apparently, Little Mac wasn’t the only one getting knocked out.”*

Anyway for humor's sake this is what (all) the characters of Punch-Out's 2009 wii would say in 2025 about their glorious (and I mean fabulous) stereotypes:

=====================================================

*Cue dimly lit basement, folding chairs in a circle, stale coffee in the corner. A neon sign flickers:* ***""PUNCH-OUT!! ANONYMOUS""*** 🥊☕

**Doc Louis:**

*""Alright, everyone, welcome back to Punch-Out!! Anonymous. We're all here because Nintendo ghosted us harder than Little Mac ghosting cardio day. Who wants to start?""*

**Little Mac:**

*""Hi, I'm Little Mac, and I'm a Nintendo mascot…technically. I've trained harder than anyone here, and my reward? Smash Bros. benchwarmer. Thanks, Sakurai.""*

**Doc Louis:**

*""Mac, baby, you ain't even DLC-worthy anymore. Now pass the mic before I eat it."" 🍫*

**Glass Joe:**

*""Bonjour, I'm Glass Joe, and I have the win-loss record of a weathered baguette. But at least I didn't lose to a wooden chair, Aran."" 🥖*

**Aran Ryan:**

*""Oh, real rich coming from a guy who folds faster than Nintendo's PR team during controversy.""*

**Glass Joe:**

*""At least my greatest rival isn't a restraining order from the furniture department, you unhinged potato.""*

**Von Kaiser:**

*""Guten Tag, I'm Von Kaiser. Nintendo says I'm too aggressive. ME? Aggressive? I just yell motivational phrases like 'DO BETTER, OR I WILL CRUSH YOU INTO STRUDEL.'""*

**Disco Kid:**

*""Heyyyy sugar pies, Disco Kid here! I'm all glitter and groove, baby. Nintendo says I'm 'too flamboyant.' Yeah? And Mario isn't flamboyant in his fifth different golf outfit? Please.""*

**King Hippo:**

*""Greetings, peasants. I'm King Hippo, and I've been told my belly is 'problematic.' Bro, it's not my fault Nintendo keeps eating up Luigi's Mansion sequels instead of feeding me screen time."" 🍗*

**Piston Honda:**

*私は本物の戦士です。私の眉毛は侍の刀のように鋭いです。しかし、任天堂は私たちの方向に眉をひそめることさえできません。*

*Watashi wa honmono no senshi desu. Watashi no mayuge wa samurai no katana no yō ni surudoi desu. Shikashi, Nintendō wa watashitachi no hōkō ni mayu o hisomeru koto sae dekimasen.*

*( ""I am a true warrior. My eyebrows are sharp like a samurai's blade. But Nintendo can't even raise a single one in our direction."" )*

**Bear Hugger:**

*""Hey there, I'm Bear Hugger. Nintendo says I'm too 'stereotypically Canadian.' Oh, sorry for respecting nature, eh? Meanwhile, Wario's out here actively committing tax fraud in every single game."" 🍁*

**Great Tiger:**

*""Namaste, everyone. I’m Great Tiger. Nintendo says I’m too ‘mystical.’ Bro, Link literally time-travels with an ocarina and rides a talking boat. But I’m the problem?"" 🪄*

**Don Flamenco:**

*""Ah, mi amor! Nintendo says I’m ‘too passionate.’ Are you serious? Bowser kidnaps a princess every Tuesday and calls it ambition. Meanwhile, I’m out here looking like a telenovela heartthrob and I’m the issue?"" 🌹*

**Aran Ryan:**

*""Ahhh, top o’ the mornin’, everyone! Nintendo says I’m ‘too aggressive and chaotic.’ Bruh, have you seen Kirby? That pink menace literally consumes universes and smiles about it. But sure, I’m the scary one."" 🍀*

**Glass Joe** (cutting in)**:**

*""Your greatest achievement is being the final boss of a folding chair,* ***mon ami.****""*

**Aran Ryan:**

*""Your greatest achievement is being the tutorial enemy,* ***ya baguette fossil.****""*  


**Soda Popinski:**

*""Здравствуйте! (Good day, my comrades!) They watered me down to soda pop, comrades. But Mario? He’s out here drinking mysterious potions and growing ten feet tall. How's that not suspicious?""*  
  
**Bald Bull:**

*RAAAH! Nintendo says I’m too intimidating. Meanwhile, Ganondorf’s out here chucking lightning bolts at toddlers. I headbutted one guy and suddenly, I’m the villain.*  
  
**Super Macho Man:**   
  
*Oh honey, Nintendo told me I was ‘too much.’ Meanwhile, Captain Falcon is out here karate-chopping planets in half while wearing skintight spandex. But I’m the over-the-top one?* 💪

**Mr. Sandman:**

*""Listen up. I’m Mr. Sandman, and I put people to sleep professionally. Nintendo says I’m ‘too intimidating.’ Bro, have you seen Tom Nook’s mortgage payments? Now that’s scary.""* 🛌

**Donkey Kong:**

*""OOH OOH AH AH!"" (Throws banana peel at a coffee cup)*

*(Translation: ""Y’all still mad about stereotypes? I’ve been wearing the same red tie since the Reagan administration. Call me when that gets an update."")* 🍌

**Doc Louis (Mic Drop Time):**

*""Well, Nintendo might’ve left us in the basement, but guess what, baby? We’re still swingin’, still laughing, and still ready to clock in the second they blow the dust off our gloves. Now go get ‘em, champ!""* 🥊🍫

=========================================================

***Cue applause, folding chairs creak, and someone awkwardly tries to refill the stale coffee pot.***

=========================================================

**Final Note from The Gremlin Commentary Booth (me):**  
**====================================**

*This group therapy session was brought to you by Nintendo’s fear of commitment and a whole lotta unresolved potential. 🛎️🔥*

  
=========================================================  
*Trolling aside. Here's my final take on that and the future for Punch-Out to come:*

*One final thought to our future indie developers:*

***🧠 The Problem: Punch-Out's KO Moment:***

*First off, the Punch-Out series is caught in an \*impossible paradox\* :*  

*- Keep the charm and legacy: Fans want the goofy, over-the-top stereotypes because \*that's what Punch-Out is\*.*

 *- Avoid backlash: Modern audiences and critics (rightfully) call out stereotypes for being problematic.*

***You can't have both without either:***

*1. Watering down the characters into bland archetypes, losing their unique appeal.*  

*2. Doubling down on the stereotypes, and risking becoming the internet's punching bag (pun intended) .*  

*On top of that, Nintendo isn't a charity. If Luigi's Mansion and Mario Strikers are raking in* ***Scrooge McDuck levels of coin*** *, why would they bother investing in something* ***that'll cause PR headaches and barely sell by comparison?***

﻿*Nintendo's motto might as well be:* ***“If it doesn't print money, it's not our problem.”***

***💡 How To Solve It (Punch Out Style):***

*#### 1.* ***Lean Into the Goofiness, Not the Stereotypes:***

*- Keep the cartoonish charm but* ***modernize*** *the humor.*  

*- Characters don't have to rely on outdated stereotypes to be fun. Think less* ***“over-the-top national caricatures”*** *and more* ***“absurd personalities.”***  

*Example:*

﻿***Soda Popinski →*** *Make him an unhinged fitness influencer chugging protein shakes and Energy drinks mid-fight.*  

***King Hippo →*** *A social media food critic who fights between bites of burgers.*

*#### 2.* ***Make It a Cross-Over Chaos Fighter:***

*- Integrate characters from other Nintendo properties or even indie games. Imagine facing off against Wario, Captain Falcon, or even Shovel Knight in a Punch-Out-style boxing ring.*  

*- Every fight could be wildly different, with gimmicks tailored to each character.*  

*#### 3.* ***Double Down on Little Mac's Storyline:***

*- Make Little Mac's journey \*cinematic\*.*  

*- A gritty underdog story but with Nintendo's charm. Maybe he's retired, washed up, and trying to make a comeback in a hilariously self-aware way.* ***Think \*Rocky Balboa\* meets \*Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\*.***  

*#### 4.* ***Digital-Only / Indie-Sized Release:***

*- If* ***big-budget development*** *is too risky, make it* ***a smaller eShop-exclusive project****.*  

*- Lower expectations, lower risk, and if it \*pops off\* (pun intended), they can escalate from there.*  

*#### 5.* ***Give It to Another Studio:***

*- If* ***Next Level Games*** *is too busy polishing Luigi's flashlight or Wario's cleats, give Punch-Out to an indie studio with a passion for the series.*  

*- Studios like* ***Yacht Club Games (Shovel Knight)*** *or the* ***Thunder Ray devs*** *could absolutely knock it out of the park.*

﻿*### 🔥* ***The Hot Take Conclusion (""EXTREME"" deep cut edition):***  

*Nintendo’s hesitation to revisit Punch-Out isn’t about the stereotypes—it’s about their fear of commitment.*

They’re treating ***Punch-Out*** like a risky stock investment while they’re busy counting *Luigi’s Mansion* gold coins and *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe* microtransactions. But here’s the thing:

* **Stereotypes aren’t the issue—it’s execution.** Characters don’t have to rely on outdated tropes; they can evolve into modern, absurd personalities without losing their charm.

**And GameRant?** Oh, bless your hearts. You’ve turned the *Punch-Out* discussion into the equivalent of **Glass Joe tripping over his shoelaces.** **You can’t declare a franchise “dead” while ignoring every possible way it could thrive with a little creative vision.**

* *Did you ask what fans want?*
* *Did you explore indie potential?*
* *Did you even try to see beyond the surface level?*

**Nope.** Just hit **publish** and walked away like ***King Hippo at an all-you-can-eat buffet.*** 🍗

But hey, here’s the truth: ***Punch-Out can absolutely work today.*** Give it to an indie dev with passion, lean into the humor, and keep the charm intact. The fans are here. The love is here. The potential is ***dripping off the ropes.***

So GameRant, next time you want to call a beloved franchise *“effectively dead,”* maybe try stepping into the ring and *actually fighting for it.*

  


***Your move, Nintendo. "" Ding-ding!""*** *🥊✨*  
*From your loving Punch-Out fanbase.*

  


***P.S. Please give me your thoughts. Humorist takes especially when the cast dig some 4th wall breaking comments, etc. Love you guys. Stay safe and keep up the fight.***",2,1736131181.0,punchout,0,1.0,False

And when you were making those mistakes, I was sitting across from you at the coffee shop nodding, and listening, and supporting you. I was *not* sitting at a Chinese restaurant *turning away,* when you should have been *looking at me.""*

From this, I gathered that what actually hurt Carrie was the way Charlotte turned away, loudly sipping her drink, as she talked about her financial issues. I think that, by doing this, Charlotte accidentally made Carrie feel judged, and that caused this explosion of emotion from her. 

So it's always interesting to me when people only ever discuss the offering money part of this argument, since I think this was the lesser issue in Carrie's own mind.",7,1736131141.0,sexandthecity,2,1.0,False

He gets uncomfortable when I compliment him but at least he says ""thanks babe"" instead of awkward silence or changing the subject like he used to do. We have been together for 6 years. He has a chronic illness that zaps his energy. We have read Love Languages and he knows I thrive on words. He has explained how he just struggles to get words out.

I have tried romantic or flirty texts and emails to see if that would get him to express more. I get a heart emoji in response.

So I've been doing a sort of pseudo-fast thing for ages in that I typically have just coffee for breakfast, but I have my coffee with milk and tend to eat dinner pretty late, so I doubt this was at all effective. Anyway, I'm currently doing a weight loss clean living thing in solidarity with a friend, so I've decided to commit to intermittent fasting (16:8).

The issue I'm having is that I never seem to get hungry during the day; only when I'm lying in bed having already started my fast. It doesn't help that I typically go to bed past midnight, so it works out that the only time of day when I'm hungry is at 2am when I haven't eaten for 6 hours. The past couple of days this has kept me up, so I've gone downstairs and had some food, but honestly eating at night just makes you feel like shit. On the flip side, I'm fine with going the entire day without food - my schedule is just completely nocturnal.

Long tangent, my bad, but the question is, do your hunger cues adjust to your fasting schedule? And if so, how long does it take? I also don't want to be starving to death in morning lectures lol",1,1736131026.0,intermittentfasting,2,1.0,False

I been love of dunkin coffee for long time (3-4 yrs) but recently for past 2months i notice the coffee is NOT the same flavour/aroma.  it's more dark n less aorma..   
I am HSP (highly sensative personality) so i detected slightest of changes in taste/smell/details. 

I like to have hot coffee 90%, with heavy cream milk 10% 3 splenda 2 stevia. I been consistent n loved dunkin coffee with perfect light flavour n aroma. 

I hate to break it to you guys but this coffee Quality is not the same. Perhaps due to rising cost of coffee in South America.. may be the supplier may have been switched, to save cost.   
I am going to quit, its not the same, the way how darker n less aroma thtere is, might as well make my own instant coffee at home. (add a bit of zero sugar french vanilla - int'l delight milk)

Eitherway, we are not getting the same flavour coffee, this is my opinion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Outdoor living spaces are becoming more valuable for homeowners. One of the best ways to enhance your deck or patio is by adding a deck propane fire pit. Not only does it provide warmth and ambiance, but it also serves as a focal point for gatherings. Let’s explore the benefits of deck propane fire pits and why they are a worthwhile investment for your outdoor spaces.

### Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the biggest advantages of using a deck propane fire pit is its convenience. Unlike traditional wood-burning fire pits, propane models ignite with the simple push of a button. This means no more struggling with kindling or waiting for logs to catch fire. You can enjoy a cozy fire in mere moments!

### Controlled Flames

With a propane fire pit, you have complete control over the flame height and heat output. This allows you to adjust the fire to suit your needs, whether you want a low flame for a romantic evening or a more robust blaze for roasting marshmallows. You won’t have to worry about sudden gusts of wind blowing the fire out or spreading embers.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/deck-propane-fire-pit  
  
### Less Maintenance Required

Wood-burning fire pits require frequent cleaning and maintenance. The ashes can create a mess and need to be disposed of regularly. In contrast, propane fire pits produce minimal waste, meaning less time spent cleaning up and more time enjoying your outdoor space. Simply connect your fire pit to your propane tank and you’re good to go.

### Eco-Friendly Option

For those who are environmentally conscious, a deck propane fire pit can be an eco-friendly choice. Propane burns cleaner than wood, emitting fewer pollutants into the air. This is especially important if you live in an area with air quality regulations. You can feel good about enjoying your fire while reducing your impact on the environment.

### Versatile Design Options

Deck propane fire pits come in a wide variety of styles and designs to suit any aesthetic. Whether you prefer a modern look or something more rustic, there is a fire pit that can enhance your outdoor decor. You can choose from:

- **Tabletop Models:** These double as coffee tables or dining surfaces.
- **Built-In Fire Pits:** These provide a seamless look integrated into your deck.
- **Portable Fire Pits:** Ideal for those who want to move their fire pit around or take it on camping trips.

### Extended Outdoor Season

With a deck propane fire pit, you can extend your outdoor living season well into the cooler months. The warmth provided by the fire allows you to enjoy your deck even when temperatures drop. Imagine sipping hot cocoa while wrapped in a blanket, enjoying the glow of the fire with friends and family. This can quickly become your favorite place in the home!

### Safety Features

Safety is a primary concern when using fire pits. Most propane fire pits come equipped with safety features like automatic shut-off valves and spark screens. These features ensure that your outdoor experience is safe and enjoyable. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safe use to minimize risk.

### Perfect for Entertaining

Fire pits transform an ordinary deck into a lavish entertaining space. They invite conversations while providing a cozy gathering point for your guests. You can roast marshmallows, share stories, and even cook hot dogs over the open flame. A propane fire pit can elevate your outdoor gatherings and make memories that last a lifetime.

### Choose the Right Location

Placement of your propane fire pit is crucial for safety. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

- **Distance from Structures:** Ensure your fire pit is at least 10 to 15 feet away from your home, any overhanging branches, and any other structures like fences or sheds.
- **Flat Surface:** Always set up your fire pit on a flat, stable surface. This will prevent it from tipping over and causing accidents.
- **Ventilation:** Make sure the area is well-ventilated to avoid gas buildup. This is especially important if your fire pit is enclosed or on a deck without good airflow.

### Always Monitor the Fire

Never leave your fire pit unattended. Here’s what to remember:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/deck-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Stay Close:** Always have someone monitoring the fire. If you have children or pets, ensure they’re at a safe distance.
- **Fire Extinguishing Tools:** Keep a fire extinguisher, a bucket of water, or a garden hose nearby in case of emergencies.

### Use Proper Fuel and Equipment

To maintain safety while enjoying your fire pit:

- **Fuel Use:** Always use propane designed for fire pits. Avoid using flammable liquids, like gasoline, to start or accelerate the fire.
- **Check Your Equipment:** Regularly inspect your propane tank and fire pit for leaks. Use a soap and water solution on propane connections; if bubbles form, you have a leak.

### Follow Manufacturer Guidelines

Every propane fire pit comes with a set of instructions. Following them carefully is essential:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/deck-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Assembly:** Ensure that you put the fire pit together according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. This includes proper connections and securing all components.
- **Operational Instructions:** Familiarize yourself with how to ignite and extinguish the fire safely, including details on how to turn the gas on and off.

### Be Aware of Weather Conditions

Weather can significantly impact fire safety:

- **Windy Days:** Avoid using your fire pit on windy days. Wind can carry sparks and embers, posing a fire risk.
- **Wet Conditions:** On rainy days, consider another way to spend time outdoors. Using your fire pit may be impractical and unsafe if everything is wet.

### Extinguish the Fire Properly

After enjoying your time around the fire pit, proper extinguishing is vital:

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/deck-propane-fire-pit  
  
- **Turn Off Propane:** Always turn off the fuel source after use to prevent leaks or gas buildup.
- **Allow to Cool:** Allow the fire pit to cool completely before touching or moving it. This will help prevent burns or other injuries.

### Respect Local Regulations

Before setting up your fire pit, check with local authorities regarding any regulations or burning bans. Some areas might have specific rules regarding outdoor fires.

By following these safety tips, you can enjoy the warmth and ambiance of your propane fire pit on your deck without compromising your safety or that of your loved ones. Always remember that preparation and awareness are key to a fun and safe outdoor experience. Happy relaxing!

### Conclusion

Enhancing your outdoor living space with a deck propane fire pit offers a plethora of benefits that truly transform the atmosphere of any backyard. These fire pits not only provide warmth on cooler evenings but also serve as a stunning focal point for gatherings with family and friends. Imagine cozying up with loved ones around a mesmerizing flame, sharing stories, roasting marshmallows, or simply enjoying a quiet moment under the stars.

I see vegans occasionally post about seemingly having intensely visceral emotional states when seeing people eat meat and consume/use similarly made products- this all of course makes sense. I understand if you view eating animals as murder, consuming dairy as exploitation, etc, its going to be upsetting watching people support financially such products.


It seems it can be extremely overwhelming and almost mind consuming at times to the point that people who have these intense feelings can hardly think about anything else at times....


 my question is for people who experience this deep emotional state, does it only apply to animal products, or does it apply broadly to any such suggestion of travesty trigger it as well? 
 Does people consuming specific brands of chocolate that use child slavery for example cause the same reaction? Specific brands of coffee? It's still people contributing to immense suffering and travesty and even death, is it more intense when it's not related to human suffering or do these vegans experience the same emotional distress?

I'm in my mid 30s and my relatives are in their late 50s to mid 60s. We all come from the same house (in my early childhood I was raised by my grandparents) who filled two living rooms with presents for our entire extended family. It was a HUGE event. I feel bad not being successful enough where I can get everyone something small but everyone has moved to different states so its a hassle and frankly I make the least out of everyone, so it's hard. And if I get a gift I want it to mean something? Not be an obligation. For my aunts and uncles who have children I don't even bother considering their kids because we're not close. I'll only buy them something if we attend an event (like a graduation).

One issue is my wife expects us to give an equal or greater gift to the giver, and I just can't do that. This makes me feel cheap, like the grinch. We also aren't having kids so if anyone gets us gifts it goes to us instead of a child which I feel weird about. We're adults and don't need it. Like, getting or giving a random gift is always  nice but the obligation  should only be for little ones and your spouse (IMO). However, my aunts will still get something anywhere from $50-120 and I feel the need to give back, so even though I love them and enjoy spending time with them it's just obligatory at this point and I want to stop.

My parents (aunt and uncle who are like my parents) overspend on me and my wife, and we arent having children. Since I was in my late 20s I've tried to pick up the bill whenever we go out to eat and get bigger gifts for their bdays depending on how financially well off I've done in the year, but in the end its never as much ... as a young man and now as an adult they have always gotten me more. Honestly, I'd be much happier if we just took turns paying for dinner instead of the whole hullabaloo. For perspective I'd say they spend $250 on us while we spend $100 on them. For birthdays they spend maybe $300 on us while we spend $150 - $200 on them.

This year I said fuck it and bought everyone coffee, except my parents. I got them a few small things they asked for. My relatives got us food, while my parents spent big money on my wife and I. My wife chewed me out for not getting them enough, but even when I asked what they wanted they told me very inexpensive stuff.

This is what I would like to do. Really only buy something special for my wife and ask my parents if we can change the gift giving into a new tradition of going out to eat. I have one aunt who is like a sibling kind of a mother but lives the furthest. Instead of gifts, I'd just like to put the money towards travel so I can see her every few years (pay for dinners). Two other aunts, same thing, no more presents put the money towards traveling funds and buy dinner when we see them. Is anything I'm saying abnormal? I wonder how and who the rest of you buy gifts for.

They are the go to by many people. I personally do not like just going for the consumables like a coffee or drink and want to go for something reusable. The ones in stores are deceptive because they do not have that much merchandise compared to corporate locations. The last year I had my eyes on the reusable straws they sell but are a bit pricey at 13 dollars a straw. This year I was given a 15 dollar Starbucks card and a 20 dollar Starbucks card. I saw for the holiday season they had red ones. I called around because they had changed the color to purple after the holiday season. I eventually found one near by that had the red ones and asked them to put it on hold. Turned out the red ones were 50% off and they had other items that were also 50% off that they had sold for the holidays. So I got 50% off for getting the color I wanted for the reusable straws and pipe cleaner and then they had cups that were color changing that had reusable straws as mine only had 2 and the cleaner so I was able to get 2 items for 50% off and use my Starbucks gift cards I got over the holidays for it. I found it funny that they were 50% off because the only difference was the color of one and the fact one mentioned the holidays on the packaging. Nothing I would spend my own money on but really useful if you have gift cards to there. Like I mentioned many service workers do have these cards laying around.

I've needed my wisdom teeth removed for a long time. I'm 25 and I think they came in when I was younger. Spotty access to dental care. Anyway, I had a cleaning/checkup and a couple fillings done early last year while I had dental. I was told my wisdom teeth really need to be removed and have cavities. Specifically one is in a pretty advanced state of decay. That's why they hurt - I told the dentist that they were ""coming in"" and I'd had ""teething"" pain on and off for years. It makes more sense now that I know more. I can feel the bad one with my tongue and yeah, it's, like, barely there anymore. Of course the dentist told me I needed them removed, but it would have cost me around $1200 with the dental coverage I no longer have, so I said I'd have to wait and just addressed what I could afford.

So I have dental again! Very similar benefits to last time, so cost would still be around $1200. I still don't have $1200 lying around. (Things are looking better financially though, and I'm in a much better position to save.) My question is: how soon do I need to deal with this? Is this something where I could wait another year? Or is it going to get infected/hurt me? Not willing to post pictures online, sorry. (Also I don't have one of those mirrors and don't want to shove my phone in my mouth.) I'm not in terrible pain, I get mild pain maybe once or twice a month.

I have very little credit history and it seems like a lot of credit/financing options are either 1) not available for such a low amount or 2) really expensive in the long run.

I vape but don't smoke. I don't drink at all. I eat an average amount of sugar for an American. I drink coffee in the morning and then water for the rest of the day. I brush my teeth twice a day and floss once a day.

So, I wanted to give my overall thoughts and will try to give a somewhat detailed review. There was no lab testing, but I did try to do a couple of ‘lab like’ tests. This was done in a 4-bedroom 1 story house with no pets or dogs. I also got the version with the clean water and dirty water tubs (the standard) because the version that connects to the water pipes wouldn't suit my house layout at all. I’ve never owned a Dreame before and my last Roborock was many years ago.

 

Some new features:

 

\-Double brush design

\-Dustbin compression for Pets (If there is pet hair in the house, it will try to limit how much space is used in the dustbin via compression).

\-Retracting Lidar to access low areas

\-Electrolyzed water (Pro/Ultra versions only) - This is a good feature if you live in a country with 'hard' water as this can affect longevity of these devices.

\- Self-cleaning Filter

\- Self-cleaning tray

\- Ability to lift at high heights (I didn’t test this as I have no value in it and majority of you probably don’t either).

 

 

***Vacuum design: 8.5/10***

The vacuum looks very slick and modern. The retracting lidar with the different coloured LED is also a very nice touch, so I will give them props for this design. I will talk about functionality later on.

***Dock Design: 8.5/10***

It feels very premium and looks like the X40 dock design. One of the main differences is the full removal tray is no more! And you only have a small filter tray that is removal. I’m sure some will be disappointed by this change but one of the features of the X50 is that it cleans its own tray and so far, I’ve found that to be true, after multiple cleans, the tray still looks spotless. However, it has now been a very similar design for a few editions of the top model for the dock, so I feel it is time for Dreame to take a bit of a risk and change it up for the x60 in the future. That is why I'm giving it an 8.5/10 because the dock looks good, but it’s the same design. In terms of functionality, I’d give it a 10/10. It did a good job cleaning the mops for example, so I tested it with some coffee powder and here are the

I live in a family full of females with very long hair, after multiple passes of the house, I’ve seen 0 hair getting caught in the brushes, so 10/10 for that one.

but it wasn’t anything too significant. So, that’s why I gave it a 6/10 as it is a neat idea and has potential, but right now it is okay and slightly delays manual cleaning of the filter.

 

***Self-cleaning tray: 10/10***

 

https://preview.redd.it/izcundz50abe1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5ef0e1209a1f901b9de85a7b1b9eef8205315c0

The new design is very good, I did not have to clean it at all during its use and I likely will never have to clean it again. So, good job to Dreame on this one as it is definitely an amazing feature. There is a small filter tray in the middle that picks up debris and it just has to be emptied every so often.

 

 

***Retracting lidar: 6.5/10***

 

Design wise, it is a slick design, and the different LED colours are a neat touch. You have different settings for how cautious you want it to be in this feature.

https://preview.redd.it/o68jellv8abe1.jpg?width=1115&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f56c0065e2a5e01cec04d7c565913513891ba380

I tested it on a couch that has a high enough area underneath that it should be able to clean under it. The results were it using the retracting lidar in the beginning of the couch

However completely refusing to go any further despite there clearly being enough room + setting it on the least cautious option. That’s why I’m giving it a 6.5/10, right now it is way too overly cautious and I hope Dreame can improve this via firmware updates.

 

***Battery life: 5/10***

 

This is the most major disappointing aspect of the vacuum. Essentially 1% = 1 minute of use (on Clean Genius). You have around 90-100 minutes of use with a full battery, which is significantly less than the industry standard. I wouldn't say the vacuum is any faster than other brands in cleaning the house, so I can't justify it by saying it is quicker at navigating through the house, in fact it is sometimes slower in certain environments (Which I will talk about later). This is probably the biggest glaring issue with the vacuum and should be noted. However, if you plan to go to work at 8-9, let it start vacuuming and come back at 5-6 then you should be okay. For example, I started it at 8:45am and it finished at 4:45pm. The whole house area cleaned was around 121m\^2 and this was on Clean Genius (no deep cleaning).

 

***Carpet performance: 8/10***

 

So, in terms of carpet performance, it does pick up most things on the ground but, it does miss a few things including the sides of the room (Just unfortune limitation of most Robot Vacuums due to shape). I’m seeing multiple small pieces that it should pick up on the carpet + tiles and the sides are just full of small pieces. I feel this is because the FlexiArm is not used well in these situations when it comes to sides of rooms with carpet. I even set it (The FlexiArm) to the highest frequency via the app but I still had the small issue. Another thing I ran into was if there was 'stubborn' dust that is really stuck onto the carpet, it fails to really clean the majority of it. I thought the 20k kPa suction power would be enough, but no it isn't anywhere near enough. Also, it does this thing where let's say it vacuums just the carpet for 30 minutes, it will go back to ""wash the mops"" even though the mops were not used at all. I also notice the mops are dragging along the carpet to the point it somewhat distorts the shape of the mops, but luckily the carpet does not become even a little 'wet' at all due to this. One example of this is that I did one test where it was on carpet with Coffee Powder (Had issues, so will not bother talking about these results) and the mops were all stained after the test despite it not being used at all since it is on carpet:

https://preview.redd.it/tqhgo8464abe1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99651bc5d9b7faecafd9f64e407418c534ff253f

I did some carpet cleaning tests with Yellow Sand and here are the results:

**before:**

https://preview.redd.it/yfi97jqg3abe1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45048354b1909403e3912967c441fd8061239f48

This was just 1 run, so overall I’d say it did a very good job and probably would have gotten the last little bit after a second run.

  
Here is a map of the cleanup:

https://preview.redd.it/eafzt6k26abe1.jpg?width=490&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccb7bbbcf5d1cf4fc6b1f638a12d33c36f45c06c

 

***Mopping performance: 7/10***

 

The mopping is solid, the tiles come off as clean after a run and the extended mop makes sure every spot is covered. It does miss some small pieces of dust, but the FlexiArm is a lot more active on this surface and it does usually pick them up. The only negative is that the amount of water is uses can be high, but this can be changed via the settings. It does use the auto detergent, but considering it is 1:200 dilution, you will not notice the difference vs normal water. I tried testing the mopping  via the use of Coffee Powder on the ground to see how it deals with a situation like that.

https://preview.redd.it/og8z2k1s4abe1.jpg?width=2482&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2159c0a5663c0157449228d38d818f84745f7f48

It has a stain recognition + large particles setting in the app:

https://preview.redd.it/ve9ssm3x4abe1.jpg?width=1115&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43bc9e0eaf65fe859af077a68c1b953ab768fccb

It genuinely did a good job at the start, it recognised the stained areas and so it paid more attention to them:

https://preview.redd.it/dam9xy855abe1.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40260a1a7e0ad0a258831990e6639c3b9bb784d5

I was happy with its performance until around 30% left, when it decided to start mopping with Coffee Powder present and so you got this:

https://preview.redd.it/t6y8ovta5abe1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed98c3ac1ca51d0f31ffaad9a62ccd9e89f08268

The Coffee Powder was just attached to the ground at this point, so couldn’t continue the test anymore and probably would have been better using something else. However, large amounts of pieces were still on the ground but it is my fault for using Coffee Powder to do this test, it wasn't a good choice. It does fine in every day situations.

 

***Obstacle avoidance: 9/10***

 

The obstacle avoidance is very good, it avoids everything and recognises everything ALMOST right. This includes cables, small objects like a white toy pen that I couldn't even see on the carpet until it told me about it. The screenshot qualities are not great, but good enough that you will know what is in the way. However, the reason it isn't 10/10 is because it does have false positives at times especially on carpets with patterns on them, but sometimes it does correct itself and recognise there is no obstacle there later on. Also, it will recognise obstacles in the wrong part of the room sometimes, so it will ‘avoid’ it in the middle of the room when the actual obstacle is at the end of the room.

 

***Navigation: 7/10***

 

Overall, navigation is alright. If you have an open area with little obstacles. However, if you have things like a table with chairs that does not have a lot of room, few tall sofas closely together (where the robot vacuum can go under and clean), it struggles quite a bit to be honest and takes significantly longer than it should. It will also sometimes form random circles on the carpet, but this has gotten less after recent firmware updates. It also got stuck in one specific area, where there is a higher and lower carpet close to each other next to a wall even though it  should easily be able to get out of the situation, it just gives up and says there is an issue with the wheels (when there isn't). However, it was limited to that area only and I didn't experience this anywhere else. I would also say very tight spaces, it is not fantastic with, but I'm talking spaces barely bigger than itself so this is understandable. I forgot to mention, within 1 hour I see a massive white line across the vacuum, so it bumps into things (gently) and will do 360s when it is close to things such as well. I bought some thin PE foam tape and put it around the vacuum (avoiding sensors, cameras etc) and this resolved this issue but that 1 white line still remains.

 

***FlexiArm: 6.5/10***

I completely forgot about this one, but I did mention it in the other sections, I'd say it does overall alright job on non-carpet area but could be better used on carpet to cover the sides and should be turned on more frequently. 

***Maintenance: 9/10***

 

Pretty straightforward maintenance overall. Empty dirty water, re-fill the clean water, re-fill the auto detergent etc. The self-cleaning filter is 50/50 but the self-cleaning tray is amazing and does a really good job. Where it loses points for me is that I feel the cover where the auto detergent and dust bin are placed can be a lot more user friendly and easier to put back in. It required me doing it a few times before it finally sat properly. The app tells you when and what to replace over time as well, which is very nice.

 

***App experience: 7.5/10***

 

I'll keep this section short; it is a pretty good app and gets too much hate at times (outside certain firmware updates). It has a ton of features and is overall user friendly. I did run into one issue where when 90% of my house was vacuumed + mopped and this resulted in the app becoming very laggy, which is definitely an issue.

 

***Things I cannot/did not test:***

 

Longevity - Only had it for a short period.

Pet use - There are specific features it has to help with pets, but I don't have pets so any testing related to pets I can't discuss at all.

I can't test the voice commands (including via Alexa and Google) + AI voice features because it is the Chinese version.

Lift feature – No interest at all in this.

 Electrolyzed water - I wouldn't even know where to begin in terms of testing it.

 

Overall, I'd be lying to you if I said I was blown away by its performance, it has issues that need addressing that were mentioned above + the price it will be released at is likely going to make it likely the most expensive Robot Vacuum on the market once it is released, so I can't justify the price tag at that price (Probably $1900-2000 USD before discounts). However, I bought it for $650-700 USD (excluding additional costs to get it working here) so for that price, it was probably worth it. If you have the X40, I'd recommend saving your money and passing on this one unless you have pets then I'd look into the new features or If you feel the self-cleaning options etc are worth it. If you want a rating out of 10, I'd say it is a 7.5/10.

 

 

\*\*tl;dr\*\*

 

Overall, decent vacuum but has poor battery life (1 minute use = 1%), navigation can be iffy if complicated layout but otherwise does well, carpet performance + mopping is good but nothing mind blowing. New features like retracting lidar is too overly cautious, self-cleaning filter is okay, but the self-cleaning tray is extremely good.

If you have X40, skip this one unless you want the pet features and/or retracting lidar. The self-cleaning stuff maybe a selling point for some as well. 7.5/10",1,1736130510.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False

Your lovely community has given me a lot of great starting points for planning a Hawaii trip with my spouse for next month, but I'm hoping to get some knowledgeable feedback on our current plan. 



Setting the scene: 

My spouse has a work conference in Honolulu next month. We are taking the opportunity to turn it into a vacation as well, with a few days together on Big Island before the conference, and then I'll mostly be entertaining myself solo on Oahu while they are busy networking and whatnot. We are from the Midwest, and are primarily interested in ocean time/snorkeling and other ecotourist type activities. Some of the museums and cultural things in Honolulu also caught my interest. We also love all food, especially seafood. I already have so many restaurant recs I've stolen from comments, but more are always welcome!  

I have learned from ya'll that winter is not necessarily the best time for ocean activities, but we will cross our fingers we can get a few snorkels in, guided or otherwise. We are intermediate level snorkelers (and scuba certified, though not planning on diving this trip) who have our own masks/snorkels/fins. 



Our current plan:

Feb 5: 

Fly to Kona. Current plan (not yet booked) is hotel + car rental booked through Costco. 

Feb 6-9: 

Volcano Nat'l Park 

Any/all of the following locations for snorkeling if able: 2 Step, Manini'owali Beach, Captain Cook, Kealakekua Bay. 

Night manta ray snorkel (through Sea Paradise?)

Other non-ocean activities if needed: Coffee or vanilla farms

Feb 10-16: 

Fly to Honolulu

As I will be mostly sightseeing solo for this portion of the trip, I'm not sure if it would be worth renting a car or not. Maybe just trying for a ride share or something on a few of the days? I also am not sure I would feel safe snorkeling without a buddy, but am open to guided excursions. 

Activities that have looked interesting, in no particular order: Foster Botanical Garden, Chinatown, Iolani Palace, Bishop Museum, Hololulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, Hanauma Bay (could be difficult to get in, sounds like), Puu Ualakaa State Park, Makapu'u Point, Ali'i Beach Park.

I sat down this evening to see how everything fits and I had a few initial concerns on which y’all could maybe weigh in to help me dial this situation. 

Here’s what’s in the box already:
- Firemaple 600ml Gooseneck Kettle
- Firemaple Ultralight Titanium stove
- Isobutane canister
- 1zpresso Q
- MHW 3Bomber scale
- Plastic Hario v60-02 with filters
- Coffee 
- Generic thermometer
- 500ml Yeti rambler with the cup lid

I’d like to add in a dosing cup as the 1z Q can’t do 30g in one shot and I typically make 532ml of coffee. I like to at least have the flexibility to brew two cups at once when possible. Are there any recos on something that is compact and either metal or wood that could do the trick for this purpose? 

My other main concern is just how much space the v60-02 takes up. There’s kind of no good way to pack it in without what feels like a bunch of wasted space. It would be really nice to be able to carry an extra cup for whoever is with me at the time. I’m not sure I love the folding options I’ve seen but maybe there’s something I haven’t looked at, or the products I’ve seen are actually fine. Any ideas? 

Also would love general feedback. Is there anything missing? Should I do anything differently?

We talked like 20 times between meetings for up to 5 minutes over a span of a couple months. We are both in our thirties, she seems like a traditional woman and looking long-term (as am I).

Because of the work environment, I didn't ask many personal questions and I felt she was reserved about her personal life, but I cared about her projects and personally supported her when she needed it, she did the same. Now that the project is over, I thanked her and asked her out and she agreed. **There is no possibility of working together again, there are no problems with that.**

The point is, I have a date with her, there is mutual trust and understanding in a work environment, but I still don't know much about her personally yet, that is why I am asking her out right? However, I don't have much recent experience in dating since in the last years I have been very focused on my professional career. I assume she already noticed that, still, she is pretty special so I took the initiative and she agreed.

My plan is to meet her in the afternoon near her office for coffee and a walk in a park. 1h to 2h max. Something short and gentle to transition and build anticipation for the next date. **At the moment, transitioning from work to personal, light touching and a soft kiss seems like a success for a first date. I don't know if that plan could be boring, but I am focused on moving things, not rushing them.**

**I assume a beautiful woman in her mid-30s will have wide experience and (perhaps) high expectations. So I don't know if I am overthinking about a soft transition from work to platonic to romantic and I just need to act like in a normal date.** In that case, what might she expect dating a man in his mid-30s looking long-term? Again, is that plan boring and might fall into friendship?

1huo555,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1huo555,Every Starter Solo Run. #029 - Nidoran♀ | Eternatus trying his best but wave 66 is still harder. 12/587,"Hey everyone! KC here! Bringing you another episode of the Every Starter Solo Run! Nidoran's time!

Nidoran♀, I have mixed feelings about you. You were really easy to get to 50+ wave, really hard to get you past that and you ended Eternatus while taking a coffee.

Tho, can we make a pause here to talk about what is supposed this Pokemon to be? Nidoqueen has 92 Attack and 75 Special Attack. So obviously is a much better physical attacker. Well, she doesn't learn any great physical move via levelling up. And her egg moves are special. And her passive boosts Sp. Attack when burned. Someone has identity problems!

But her stats are not the only bad thing. Her egg moves. Okay, as I said Malignant Chain is pretty good, but Nidoqueen learns Sludge Wave at lvl 1 (Mushroom and you get it), which is 5 less power but has 10 PPs and hits both opponents. Then there's Sandsear Storm, 100Pwr/80Acc. And Nidoqueen also learns at lvl 1 Earth Power 90/100. So why would you want any of those attacks?? Yeah they are good for the start, but just as any other decent egg move, and in late game you just want to change them for her lvl 1 moves! Then she has Calm Mind, actually decent but mostly for boss fights and even then it's hard to set it up due to Nidoqueen being so slow. And the last one is Moonlight, which I guess makes it easier for the first 20-30 waves, but you will change that move later in the game since you need 3 attacking moves with Nidoqueen, Poison Type, Ground Type and whatever the best TM you can get is to cover against Corviknight and similar who will make you cry.

So as I said early stages are really easy, you can get Nidoqueen really early into the game if you are lucky, and the same goes with the Flame Orb that boosts your sp attack. Problems came mostly with Evil Team fights at floor 60. 

Wave 66 was the main run killer, no possibility of getting back some waves and me having no idea about which pokemons the enemies had made it really hard. But the main issue was the burn. Needing to be burned every single turn for Flare Boost, was making me stumble. And if you add the fact that you are slower than much Pokemons, then you have a real problem. 

Mostly all my runs died just because I didn't have any healing items. I managed to get one run to 165 without healing items, but Cosmos President Rose was a wall with his Galarian Articuno lowering my accuracy and speed and then GMax Copperajah to finish me off.

So when I got Garbodor's encounter in this run at wave 81, I knew it had to be the chosen one. I managed to get through the run getting really close to die every single battle, but surviving just powered by faith (and maybe leftovers and shell bells).

There was no fight this run that needed deep thinking. I checked E4 and Champion teams in advance to relearn any needed moves and have an idea of what was ahead. 

Against Ivy, I went without Sludge Wave and just had Earth Power and Ice Beam as attacking moves. Why? Well, I had Calm Mind, that was a must in every boss fight, but for Ivy, I also learned Reflect. I reflected first turn as Ivy changes to Toucannon. I could then Calm Mind a bit and then kill Toucannon and kill Rayquaza in two hits while resisting his attacks.

For the most part of the run I had Sludge Wave/Earth Power and then two out of the next attacks Thunderbolt/Ice Beam/Dragon Pulse/Calm Mind. I learned Sand Tomb and Protect in the way to Eternatus, and relearned them for the fight.

Against Eternatus, I Calmed Mind to +6 while he was trying to deal some damage, which was mission impossible for him. I then went for Earth Power + Sand Tomb and Nidoqueen won the fight chilling in the sofa.

So that's how Nidoran♀ did! I recorded the first half of the run and the other half was this [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/imworthy13/v/2345437660?sr=a&t=5111s) . You can follow the Twitch [channel](https://www.twitch.tv/ImWorthy13) if you want to miss out on the next streams!

When I and the baby were discharged I never left the house until after 8 weeks. My thoughts behind it was that I or my baby would get ill and we'd be back in hospital. Fast forward I am getting out and about but not as often like maybe once every two weeks? Sometimes it could be once a month. I do feel like I'm going crazy. I didn't participate in new years fireworks because I was scared of my baby getting hurt so I stayed in and watched it from the window. Last week we went out for a walk and I didn't want a coffee because I was scared I'd accidently drop it on baby. I am scared of germs viruses RSV you name it. Recently I have been feeling really empty and distant and whenever I talk about it with my partner he says that I'm not helping the relationship and that he feels distant from me too.

Intimacy is out the window and the only cuddles I get is from my baby. My partner believes I have changed and he's put off by me especially by what he saw during labour.

## Rancilio Silvia PID Tuning: Optimize Your Espresso Machine for Perfection

The Rancilio Silvia is a beloved espresso machine, prized for its build quality and performance.  However, achieving truly consistent and delicious espresso often hinges on precise temperature control.  Upgrading your Silvia with a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller can dramatically improve temperature stability, leading to significantly better espresso. This guide will walk you through understanding PID controllers, installing one on your Rancilio Silvia, and fine-tuning it for optimal extraction.

## Understanding PID Controllers and Their Benefits for Espresso

A PID controller is an advanced temperature regulation system that offers far superior accuracy compared to the standard thermostat found in the stock Rancilio Silvia.  Instead of the on/off cycling of a basic thermostat, which leads to temperature fluctuations, a PID controller constantly monitors and adjusts the boiler's heating element to maintain a precise target temperature, typically within ±1 degree Celsius. This consistency is crucial for achieving optimal espresso extraction.

**Key Advantages of a PID Controller for Your Rancilio Silvia:**

* **Precise Temperature Control:**  This is the most significant benefit.  Consistent temperature throughout the brewing process ensures even extraction and prevents channeling, resulting in a more balanced and flavorful espresso.
* **Improved Efficiency:** By minimizing temperature swings, the PID controller reduces the time the machine spends heating and cooling, leading to faster brewing cycles and energy savings.
* **Enhanced Flavor:** The direct consequence of precise temperature control is a significant improvement in the overall taste of your espresso.  You'll experience richer crema, enhanced sweetness, and a more nuanced flavor profile.
* **Reduced Wear and Tear:**  The gentler heating cycles provided by a PID controller can extend the lifespan of your machine's components.

## Installing and Tuning a PID Controller on Your Rancilio Silvia: A Step-by-Step Guide

Installing a PID kit on your Rancilio Silvia is a relatively straightforward process, but requires care and attention to detail.  Numerous kits are available online specifically designed for the Silvia.  Always choose a reputable supplier and carefully read all instructions before beginning.

**Step-by-Step Installation:**

1. **Purchase the PID Kit:** Choose a kit specifically designed for the Rancilio Silvia.  These kits typically include the PID controller, a temperature sensor (usually an RTD screw-in sensor), wiring, and mounting hardware.
2. **Prepare Your Machine:**  Power down and unplug your Rancilio Silvia.  Allow it to cool completely before proceeding.
3. **Mounting the PID Controller:**  Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions for mounting the PID controller. This usually involves drilling a small hole in the machine's side panel to accommodate the controller's display and controls.
4. **Connecting the Temperature Sensor:**  The temperature sensor needs to be securely installed in the boiler.  The precise location will be specified in your kit's instructions. This sensor provides crucial temperature feedback to the PID controller.
5. **Wiring the PID Controller:**  Connect the wiring according to the provided diagram.  Carefully double-check all connections to avoid short circuits. Ensure all connections are secure and well-insulated.
6. **Initial Setup and Calibration:**  Once everything is connected, power on your machine.  The PID controller will display the current boiler temperature.  The kit's instructions will guide you through the initial setup, often involving setting the desired brewing temperature and potentially adjusting initial PID parameters.

**Tuning Your Rancilio Silvia PID Controller:**

After initial installation, you'll likely need to fine-tune the PID constants to optimize performance for your specific machine.  These are typically labeled P (Proportional), I (Integral), and D (Derivative).  Many kits come with default settings, but adjustments often yield superior results.

* **Proportional (P):** This constant determines the initial response to temperature deviations.  A higher P value leads to faster responses but can also cause oscillations.  Adjust this value cautiously, starting with small increments.
* **Integral (I):** This constant corrects for persistent temperature errors.  A higher I value reduces offset but can increase oscillation.
* **Derivative (D):** This constant anticipates future temperature changes and helps prevent overshooting.  Adjusting the D value is generally less crucial than P and I, and often left at the default setting.

**Important Note:**  Fine-tuning involves making small adjustments and observing the results.  Keep a detailed log of your adjustments to track progress and avoid accidentally making detrimental changes.  Many PID controllers allow you to save multiple profiles, allowing you to experiment and compare different settings.

## Fine-Tuning and Troubleshooting Your Rancilio Silvia PID

While the installation and initial setup are straightforward, achieving optimal performance often requires fine-tuning.

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

* **Temperature Oscillations:**  Slight temperature fluctuations around the set point are normal.  However, excessive oscillations indicate a need to adjust the PID constants, particularly the I (Integral) value. Reducing the I value often helps dampen oscillations.
* **Slow Heating/Cooling:**  If your machine is too slow to heat up or cool down, you might need to adjust the P (Proportional) value upwards.  Remember to test your adjustments in small increments.
* **Overheating:**  If the boiler overheats, check your wiring, sensor, and ensure the safety thermostat is functioning correctly.  The over-temperature protection thermostat (with a red reset button) will trip if the boiler reaches a dangerously high temperature.
* **Inconsistent Espresso:**  Inconsistent espresso shots despite proper PID tuning may point to issues with your grinder, tamping technique, or coffee bean quality.


## Advanced Techniques and Regular Maintenance

Beyond basic tuning, several techniques can further optimize your espresso experience.

**Steam Temperature Control:** The steam temperature on the Rancilio Silvia is often controlled using an on/off system.  While less precise than the PID boiler control, understanding its behavior and potential adjustments (if your PID kit allows) can help you achieve optimal steaming performance for milk texturing.

**Regular Maintenance:**  Regular cleaning and descaling are crucial for maximizing the lifespan and performance of your Rancilio Silvia, especially with a PID controller.  Scale buildup can interfere with accurate temperature readings and cause malfunctions.


## Conclusion: Mastering Your Rancilio Silvia with a PID Controller

Installing and tuning a PID controller on your Rancilio Silvia is an investment that significantly enhances your espresso-making experience.  By following this guide and paying close attention to the details, you can unlock the full potential of your machine, achieving consistently perfect espresso shots every time. Remember patience and meticulous adjustments are key to success.  Enjoy the journey towards espresso perfection!


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:  Do I need any special tools to install a PID controller?**

A:  You'll likely need a screwdriver, possibly a drill with a small drill bit, and possibly some wire strippers.  Your specific PID kit will provide a detailed list of required tools.

**Q:  Can I damage my Rancilio Silvia by installing a PID controller incorrectly?**

A:  Yes, incorrect installation could lead to electrical shorts, damage to components, or even fire hazards.  Always follow the instructions carefully and if unsure, seek help from experienced individuals.

**Q:  What if my PID controller isn't working correctly after installation?**

A:  First, double-check all wiring connections.  Then review the troubleshooting section of your kit instructions.  If problems persist, contact the kit manufacturer's support.

**Q:  How often should I descale my Rancilio Silvia with a PID controller?**

A:  The frequency depends on your water hardness and usage.  Consult your machine's manual for recommendations and consider descaling more frequently in hard water areas.

given the reasons that i left, i had already set up a barista position at a specialty coffee shop that also served as their own roastery, so pretty high end. in the first few weeks, i contemplated going back to starbucks because of my pay. this place was not giving any of the employees tips and paid everyone under the table. as i expressed this concern to my bosses, they increased my pay by $4, explaining that it was due to my good performance and experience. within this time, i had already reached out to my former manager and set up an interview. i cancelled this interview last minute, but he still seemed to be super happy for me. 

i was fired abruptly with no discussions about my performance last week. the reasons were listed as follows: taking drinks home, training a fellow barista without notifying the managers (wasting resources), staying an extra 40 minutes to assist with a huge rush, and a specific complaint i will discuss shortly. short explanation: my managers notified us of zero policies and did not train employees that had no experience with coffee. i was able to drink and eat whatever i wanted, even if i was not on the clock. 

the final straw was due to a customer complaint about us having a pest problem, which included fruit flies and mice. they had expressed concern about these pests, and i had responded ""i know,"" and went back to doing my job. this customer had been a close acquaintance of the managers. i do not remember this interaction, as it was on a saturday and it was insanely busy, but i do understand that it was not a very kind response. even my manager notifying me about all of these reasons had acknowledged that i do not treat customers this way on a daily basis. 

now the dilemma is this: i would like to go back to starbucks and work under my old manager. i had cancelled that interview so going back and begging for a job, a second time, seems like a bad idea. i do not know how to approach any starbucks interview with this history of mine, either. it has been two months since i've left. any advice would be appreciated.

So im part of the rings of power fandom and hobbit movies fandom which are recent parts of the bigger Tolkien community, which has been around for a long time. I’m in a server of fellow ROP fans, some of us who never read the older books. And because on AO3 you get all Tolkien stuff at once, we also can see authors from the Silmarillion and LotR, who are more older by average and always get more kudos and comments. 

Me and our server members followed some of these people and after a few months we learned many of the people who get the most kudos have a professional writing background lol. For example two of the best writers teach humanities or creative writing at college level. In my community group I know that others are PhD holders. The most popular writer with hundreds of Kudo from a few years back, where the narrative rivals real fantasy novels, whose stories still get fan art today, isn’t just an MFA graduate, she teaches fantasy writing and lectures on fantasy, and used to downplay her experience. One writer with incredible prose is actually a prize-shortlisted novelist and we only found out after a server member recognized their face, since they also downplay their career. Two others of my favorites work in the publishing industry, and there are many other self published authors and English teachers. 

I don’t know, to us it feels like fan fiction has become the playground of elites, or maybe kind of nepotistic. For me, fanfiction is to be enjoyed and just for fun, and I use it like an escape. I don’t want to spend that escape feeling bad about my own self I guess, because there’s not a way for untrained people to write on the same level. And seeing them get all the kudos and comments is kind of disheartening, and to be fandom specific, adds to the idea that the book fans are more intellectual than show fans, when the reality is just that they are older and more experienced. 

I feel it raises the bar for what fanfic “should” be, and suddenly the messy, heartfelt charm that makes fanfic what it is kind of feels like it’s not enough anymore? It’s like showing up to a friendly AO3 pickup game and finding out someone brought a pro athlete = impressive but throws the whole vibe off. I’m not saying they can’t write fanfiction, by the way, I’m just saying it’s changed from the fun smutty thing to enjoy and not analyze. Like my 2k word coffee shop AU (example) feels like a school project next to their award-winning indie films. I dunno. Much to think about I guess. It makes me feel like if my work isn’t publishable standard, it wont be appreciated in this fandom. 

Do you feel the same, or am I just being insecure? Have you seen this in your fandoms too, and is it only recently? Any discussion welcome, especially if you’re in a fandom with older fans or long fandom history. ",0,1736128373.0,FanFiction,7,0.17,False

“Ow! Do you have any idea who I am?” a woman cried and stumbled into the center of the ballroom. Her red hair was rolled into double buns that covered each ear like two oversized snail shells, and she wore a white gown with long, flowing sleeves.

It took a moment for him to register that it was Deputy Wolf.

The crowd made space around her and a group of men in stormtrooper getups. But their weapons looked far more realistic than plastic replicas of blaster rifles.

The largest stormtrooper gave the princess a shove with the side of his gun, causing her to stumble forward.

“Asshole,” she muttered. She saw him gawking at her. “Okay, guys, take five. Get some treats.”

The troopers were drawn to the refreshments table as if pulled by an invisible force.

“Alan, I didn’t know you’d be here tonight.” Her face was flushed, and she struggled to straighten the buns on each side of her head as she approached.

“Oh, uh, I was just leaving. My director asked me to come, but—”

“No. Don’t go so soon.” There was urgency in her voice. Despite her well-toned body beneath the clinging gown, she seemed fragile tonight, like a frightened girl who had ended up with the wrong crowd.

“Does the princess order it?” It was the booze talking.

“Haha, yes! I mean, no, but… I don’t know why I agreed to play along with those guys.”

“Does her highness desire a drink?” He tried to channel his best Han Solo. Without waiting for her response, he picked two champagnes off the nearest server drone and handed one to her. “I’ve been drinking these all night. They’re great.”

“Why, thank you.” She lifted the glass. “Happy Halloween!”

“Happy Halloween.”

From across the room, Paul Murphy gave him a thumbs up, then disappeared into the party.

The clink of their toast was lost within the gala’s chaos.

She made a face as if she had tasted battery acid. “What is it?”

“Pumpkin spice champagne!” he intoned, raising his drink even higher.

“Oh, my Lord, that’s…”

“A tragedy, I know. But it grows on you.” He took another swallow.

The largest of the stormtroopers pushed his way through the guests and stood towering over Gwen. He held his gun so it pointed at Alan’s chest.

“Are you sure you can have a drink? He looks like he’s transporting you to the nearest Death Star.” Alan gently pushed the barrel askew. “Classy, real guns.”

“Don’t fucking touch my gun, shrink,” came the muffled voice of Comstock through the mask.

“Is that you, Acting Sherrif Comstock? The uniform of fascism fits you perfectly.” He couldn’t see Comstock’s face, but he was certain it was red with anger.

“Let’s go, princess!” The large man shoved Gwen away from Alan.

“Shit, Comstock. I’m done with the role play.” She took the pins out of her buns and let her hair cascade down her back.

The large white mask with big black eyes stared at Alan. For an instant, he thought Comstock was going to shoot him.

“These guns don’t have a stun setting,” said Comstock.

Emboldened by the liquid courage contained in the pumpkin spice champagne, Alan waved his hand in front of the stormtrooper’s face. “This is not the princess you’re searching for. You may go.”

Gwen blew champagne out her nostrils, the fine mist landing on his neck.

“Fuck you, shrink,” said Comstock. The man twirled and stomped off, shoving the badly circumcised penis out of his path as he went.

“I need a smoke,” said Gwen.

“There’s a back door. Bottoms up.”

They drained their drinks and, with tipsy grace, waltzed through the party to the rear of the ballroom.

Wind nipped their faces as they departed the warmth and light of the gala into the cold night.

“Careful, princess, watch your step.”

They followed a narrow sidewalk to the docks. In the summer season, the Flathead would have been flush with water and boats, but in October, the log stilts jutted out of the muddy lakebed, making their platforms appear like dinosaurs lined up in a museum.

They sat smoking, legs dangling over the edge. Cars buzzed distantly on the highway. Across the bay, lights from other resorts ran the spectrum from blue to amber.

“I’m sorry about the way Comstock dealt with Francis. He was out of line,” said Gwen.

“I’m guessing you couldn’t do anything about it,” he replied.

“He’s my superior.” She took a drag, the ember lighting the front of her face.

He swigged the vodka. “Cops went bad in the valley,” he said

“There’re a few good ones left. McGreevy…” she said

“The little guy?”

“He’s good people. Grew up rough. He has a backbone. Just forgets sometimes. Makes a mean pot of coffee.”

The booze and the cold were making him shiver. They had neglected to bring their coats.

He smoked. Her brand of cigarettes was strong.

“What about Francis?” she asked.

He sighed. “I shouldn’t say too much. I promised him… He’s seen better days.”

“Poor kid,” she said. “I interviewed the responding physician at the hospital in Ronan. You can imagine, tight-lipped. She did say that Taylor moved his daughter to his ranch. He pays for his own doctors.”

“He can afford it,” said Alan.

She laughed suddenly.

“What?”

“I just remembered a handsome, sophisticated substitute teacher my first year of high school.”

“Are you fucking kidding me?” he said.

“No,” she said. “Mrs. Sullivan’s freshman English. You taught Romeo and Juliet. You were good. You had Brian Conley and Andrea Marshal do the death scene. I still remember. Oh happy dagger…” she trailed. “Okay so maybe not.”

“This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die.” He finished the line for her.

“Told you. You were good.”

“You’re saying *I* was *your* teacher? Now I feel like a perv.”

“Do you remember a quiet redhead in the third row? I always sat in the same spot next to the window.”

He closed his eyes and dredged his memories. He'd done a long substitute gig for a teacher who had suffered a nervous breakdown after being locked in the supply closet.

“It was a long time ago. I’ve forgotten a lot about that time.”

“I never wore panties,” she said.

A distant, illicit memory struck him quickly. He was glad it was dark, so she couldn’t see the expression that must have crossed his face. He’d let it go as the least of his issues during those dark, intoxicated years after—

“Christ,” he said.

She laughed. “Yeah, now it’s coming back, ain’t it? I had… *issues* back then.”

“And now you’re a cop, locking up the men you used to jailbait.”

“And you’re a shrink. I wonder who’s more fucked up?” She took the last drag of her cigarette and flicked it to vanish over the side of the dock like a falling star.

“I’m going to turn into a pumpkin in about thirty minutes,” Alan said. “Do you have a ride home? I’d hate for you to leave with the same assholes.”

“I can walk. I don’t live far.” Gwen replied.

“I’ve got a self-driver. I won’t even touch the steering wheel. If you want…”

There was a pause in which the music from the party filtered in before she said, “Alright, it’ll be my first time in a civilian self-driver.”

“Are you serious? Do you have running water in your house?”

When they rose to leave, he noticed a woman in a long, black dress watching them from the end of the dock. As they approached, he saw her face painted white with lips of crimson red—the costume of the romantic vampire he’d glimpsed earlier in the coatroom.

“Looks like we’re not the only ones who wanted to get out of that party,” Gwen observed.

“Dr. Smith?” said the woman.

“Yes, that’s me,” he said.

“I was hoping I could have a word with you.” She spoke with a French accent.

“We were just leaving.”

“Please. It will take but a moment.”

He looked at Gwen. She shrugged.

“Well, I guess so. Let’s chat inside.”

“No,” she said abruptly. “Here is fine. I don’t have much time.”

“I’ll meet you inside,” said Gwen.

“Please stay, Deputy Wolf,” the woman interjected.

“Did I catch your name, ma’am?” asked Alan.

“I am Dr. Lethe Vonnix. I am an emissary from a group called the Roanne Collective. We’re contributors to your clinic.”

“Thank you,” said Alan, realizing that this was some of the elbow bumping Murphy wanted him to do. “Clear Hope appreciates it. Dr. Murphy is the one you want to talk to.”

“I have spoken to Dr. Murphy. He directed me to you.”

To his left, he noticed the stormtroopers marching toward them in single file from the resort.

“Okay, we’ll probably just need to exchange emails or something.” He nudged Gwen and indicated the approaching company.

“Shit,” said Gwen.

The woman who called herself a doctor implored, “Please, Dr. Smith. I need to know the methodology you plan to use with Francis Builds A Fire.”

Alan nodded. Now he understood. “That bitch! You can tell Becky Madison—”

“Dr. Madison is not of my concern,” said Vonnix. “Dr. Smith, I have a sincere reason to believe that Francis Builds A Fire is in grave peril.”

“Peril? Peril from me? You think I would hurt him? No. I want you to tell Becky to go fuck herself.”

Gwen put a hand on his arm. The Empire was upon them.

“Wolf, we’re going,” Comstock’s voice boomed. The muscular cop held his costume helmet under his arm while his friends stood behind him, their weapons resting on their shoulders.

“I’m fine,” said Gwen.

“Peril from something you’re not ready to understand,” said Vonnix.

“Are you fucking with me?” Alan said.

“Fuck you, shrink.” Comstock spat.

“I’m giving her a ride home. You guys can go play make-believe under the covers.”

“Dr. Smith, I won’t have another chance to speak with you before they find you. You must protect the boy.” The woman turned and hurried back to the resort.

The bitter wind had picked up, carrying on it a newly minted flurry that wet his face. His mind was a slurry of alcohol and rage.

“It wasn’t my fault! It wasn’t my fault!” Alan shouted after her.

The next thing he knew, he was looking down the barrel of Comstock’s gun.

“You’re drunk. You’re not driving,” insisted the cop.

“Jesus, Comstock, he’s got a self-drive. Put that down,” said Gwen. “Don’t worry, it’s not loaded.”

Comstock didn’t move.

Gwen grabbed Alan’s hand. “I’m ready to go.”

They pushed past the stormtroopers and headed back up the walk that had turned slick since their outing. Some of the gala goers had stepped outside and were staring at the dock. A few of them whispered as Alan and Gwen walked by.
***

The purple canopy of the port-cochere did little to shield them from the ice flakes whipped by the wind.

Jacketless, Gwen crossed her arms. He was in the initial stages of being a gentleman and offering her his coat when his midnight-gray self-driver pulled up with a soft hum. 

Inside, the car was warm, and the seats radiated heat.

“Where to, Dr. Alan Smith, sexiest man alive,” said the sultry AI voice. He glanced at Gwen. A grin spread across her face.

“Is that Raven Maddox?” she said.

“Kind of a joke. Raven, normal voice, please.”

“Yes, Dr. Smith. Turn me on again whenever you wish.” There was a soft *beep,* and the computer continued in a robotic manner: “Please state your destination.”

“Passenger’s directions,” he said.

“Passenger enabled.”

“Just tell it your address.”

“Ninety-eight Highland Avenue,” Gwen said.

“Affirmative. ETA in ten minutes.”

“I thought you lived close by,” he said.

“Exercise never killed anyone,” she said.

He reclined in his seat and stared up through the sunroof at the passing streetlights. His head swam. Now that a very attractive woman was sitting next to him, he regretted drinking.

Gwen followed his lead and put her seat back. In the reflection of the glass, he saw her hand gripping the armrest. “It’s so strange letting a computer do the driving,” she said.

“You just need to relinquish control and put your faith in the machine.”

“Fuck machines. They’re going to be the end of us.”

“Before the self-drive grid, human error killed roughly forty-thousand people a year on American roads. Compare that to seventy-two deaths that can be solely attributed to autonomous vehicles.”

“Thank you, Dr. Facts.”

“Sorry. I watched the promotional video for the car.”

“I guess someday even us holdouts will be forced onto the grid.”

“Sorry about back there,” he said. “I’m a walking faux pas.”

“It’s alright. It’s Halloween.”

For an instant, he felt her soft hand on his.

ALERT! ALERT! flashed on the windshield’s display. “Driver alert. Possibility of being followed,” announced the computer in an elevated tone.

Alan sat up, craning his neck to see out the back window.

“What the hell?” Gwen said.

“This thing is funky.” He hit the dash, but the computer repeated its warning.

“Are you sure?” She was now looking back over her shoulder.

“The computer is programmed to detect the possibility of being tailed. It’s an anti-kidnapping feature.”

The headlights of the car behind them flashed three times.

“I think they want us to stop,” said Gwen.

“Let’s stop at the Town Pump. It’s usually busy. We’ll see what they want. Computer, take us to Town Pump.”

They made slow progress through the town. Christmas and Halloween lights glittered in shop windows. Little kids dressed in ghoulish costumes and heavy overcoats carried large bags full of candy. The autopilot slowed in calculation of the holiday foot traffic.

The car behind them backed off but kept its lights on bright.

“I bet it’s Comstock,” Alan said.

“It’s not his car. Could be one of his goons. He’s the type to have me followed.”

“Are you and him…”

“Hell no.”

At a red light, the car pulled up close behind them and flashed its lights again. It was a black SUV without front plates.

“Unsafe distance achieved,” said the AI.

“No shit,” he muttered. At the next red light, the SUV pulled alongside. He had to look up to see a window with blackout tint.

“ETA in three minutes,” said his car.

Gwen was clenching her hands on her lap.

“Do you have a gun?” Alan asked.

“Does it look like I’m carrying a gun?”

“Right,” he said. “Stupid question.”

“I don’t use guns when I’m off duty. Hell, I don’t use them on duty. What are they doing?”

“I don’t know. I’ve never been followed before. Town Pump is busy. There’s always a security guard on duty and probably a cop eating donuts.”

When the light changed, they merged into traffic on Highway 93. Ahead, Town Pump loomed as an illuminated oasis. They pulled in under the bright canopy and stopped at the front door.

The SUV parked at an angle next to a charging bank.

“Computer.”

“Yes, Dr. Smith?”

“Authorize passenger without driver.”

“Passenger authorized.”

“If anything happens, it’ll take you wherever you tell it to go.”

“You’re going out there?”

“I don’t like being followed,” he said.

“Pretty brave for a shrink. Want back up?”

“I’ll be fine. If I’m abducted, you can have my car.”

“Alan, I can have backup here in five minutes.”

“Have they done anything illegal?”

“Not technically.”

“Let’s see what’s up. I prefer losing a kidney to dealing with Comstock again.”

As he stepped out of his car, the SUV shut off its headlights and sat there like a sleek, angular predator waiting to pounce.",0,1736128067.0,HFY,2,0.5,False
1hunm66,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hunm66/tiredness_after_6_months/,Tiredness after 6 months ,"Wondering if anyone has any input. I gave up coffee nearly 7 months ago. I still have one black tea and I have found this has reduced my anxiety and my sleep is awesome. 

The downside is I am so tired all the time. I have gotten my blood work done and everything came back normal, I sleep 8-9 hours a night and exercise a few times a week. I also ride my bike to work. I have constantly gone to the gym for over ten years but the last 6 months I can barely drag myself there. 

Should I give up the tea? I don't see how it would make much difference but I am willing to experiment. Is this what life without coffee is just like? Am I expecting too much? 

I don't want to feel cracked out like I did on coffee but I would like the ability to get through my workout and get shit done still.

1hunjyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_helluvex/comments/1hunjyr/daily_soukoku_writing/,Daily Soukoku Writing !,"Chuuya Nakahara wasn’t used to silence—not this kind of silence, anyway. It wasn’t the sort born of peace, of stillness, of a world briefly catching its breath. No, this was the silence that suffocated, the kind that wrapped around you and pressed its cold, unyielding hands against your throat. It was unnatural, unnatural because it came from the absence of something that had always been there. Someone.

The small apartment was dark. The faint flicker of a streetlamp outside the window provided the only light, casting pale, fractured beams across the hardwood floor. The air smelled faintly of alcohol, bitter and acrid, mixed with the sharper tang of cigarette smoke. Chuuya’s boots creaked against the floor as he stepped inside, and the sound seemed almost obscene in its intrusion. His sharp eyes darted around the room, taking in the disarray: books piled haphazardly on a battered coffee table, an unwashed cup abandoned in the sink, a half-empty bottle of whiskey tipped on its side. It was a mess, but not an unusual one. Dazai always lived like this—as though he didn’t care if the world collapsed around him, so long as he had another drink and another reason to smirk.

But there was no smirk now. There was nothing at all.

Chuuya’s gaze fell on the figure slumped in the corner of the room, half-hidden in the shadows. For a moment, his brain refused to process what he was seeing. Dazai Osamu, his longtime partner and eternal thorn in his side, sat motionless against the wall. His head lolled forward, dark hair obscuring his face, and his long coat pooled around him like spilled ink. Chuuya’s chest tightened, and he took a hesitant step closer.

“Dazai?”

His voice sounded foreign to his own ears, raw and uncertain. He swallowed the lump in his throat and tried again, louder this time.

“Dazai, quit messing around. I swear, if this is one of your stupid jokes…”

He trailed off as he reached the other man’s side. The sight that met him froze the words in his throat. Dazai’s face was pale—too pale, even for someone who had always worn his skin like a mask of indifference. His lips were faintly blue, and his chest was still. A scattering of empty pill bottles lay at his side, their labels mocking Chuuya with their fine print.

The silence roared in his ears.

“No,” Chuuya muttered, dropping to his knees. “No, no, no. Damn it, Dazai, wake up!”

His hands moved on their own, shaking Dazai’s shoulders, pressing his fingers against the pulse point in his neck. Nothing. The reality of it hit him like a freight train, knocking the air from his lungs. He’d seen death before—he’d caused it more times than he cared to count. But this… this was different. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Not to Dazai. Not like this.

A choked sound escaped him, something between a growl and a sob. He slammed his fists against the floor, the force rattling the empty pill bottles. His mind raced, grasping for something—anything—that could undo what lay before him. But he knew better. Even he, with all his power, couldn’t bring back the dead.

He slumped back against the wall, his breaths coming in ragged gasps. His hat tipped forward, hiding his face, but it couldn’t hide the tears that slipped down his cheeks.

“You bastard,” he whispered. “You absolute bastard. You couldn’t even…” He trailed off, his throat tightening. “You couldn’t even tell me, could you? You couldn’t…”

The words came in fragments, broken and jagged, as though saying them aloud might make them real. He stared at the man who had been his partner in chaos, his rival, his reluctant ally. The man who had always been a step ahead, who had always had some clever quip ready to deflect the world’s weight. And now… now he was gone. Just like that.

Chuuya’s fingers curled into fists, his nails biting into his palms. Anger surged in his chest, hot and blinding, and he welcomed it. Anything was better than the crushing void that threatened to swallow him whole.

“What the hell were you thinking?” he spat, his voice rising. “You always had to do things your way, didn’t you? Always had to be in control. Well, congratulations, Dazai. You won. You finally…” His voice broke, and he buried his face in his hands.

The minutes stretched on, heavy and unyielding. Chuuya’s breaths eventually steadied, though the ache in his chest remained. He forced himself to look up, to face the reality before him. His hands moved almost mechanically as he reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Dazai’s face. He half-expected him to stir, to make some snarky comment about personal space. But there was only stillness.

Chuuya’s mind wandered unbidden to memories of their shared past. The battles they had fought, the grudging respect they had come to share, the rare moments of camaraderie that had felt all the more precious for their rarity. He thought of Dazai’s laughter, sharp and mocking but always with a hint of something softer beneath. He thought of the way Dazai’s eyes would light up when he was scheming, the way he could make even the most absurd plans seem inevitable. And he thought of all the times he had wanted to punch that smug grin off his face, only to find himself laughing despite himself.

“You idiot,” Chuuya muttered, his voice thick with emotion. “You absolute idiot. You could’ve… you should’ve said something. Anything. Did you really think I wouldn’t…”

He shook his head, unable to finish the thought. His hands tightened into fists again, but this time there was no anger. Only grief.

He stayed there for what felt like hours, the weight of the room pressing down on him. The world outside continued as it always did, indifferent to the loss of one more soul. But for Chuuya, everything had changed. The silence was unbearable, and yet he couldn’t bring himself to break it.

Eventually, he rose to his feet, his movements slow and deliberate. He cast one last look at the man who had been so many things to him—friend, foe, partner, enigma. A thousand words fought for release, but none of them felt like enough. So he said nothing. He turned and walked away, his steps heavy and unsteady.

The world outside was cold, the night air biting against his skin. Chuuya pulled his hat lower over his eyes, his breath fogging in the air. He didn’t know where he was going, didn’t care. All he knew was that he couldn’t stay in that room, couldn’t face the truth of what had happened.

As he walked, a single thought echoed in his mind, relentless and unforgiving.

Dazai was gone.

And he… he was still here.",1,1736127813.0,u_helluvex,0,1.0,False
1hunhpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hunhpr/how_do_i_deal_with_a_roommate_i_dont_want_to/,How do I deal with a roommate I don't want to socialize with?,"My roommate is really high strung and I think she may have bpd.  When I first moved in I was constantly cleaning the apartment and she would find new, more tedious things to complain about, like texting me about 3 crumbs on the counter or blowing up my phone about a mug in the sink--literally getting upset becauseI was ""ignoring her texts"" as I hadn't responded for 3 hours.  I was cordial and kept the conversation simple.  At that time I was washing dishes right after I had done them, but wasn't feeling well the day I left the rinsed coffee mug.  I forwarded those screenshots to my landlord who was appalled by my roommate's behavior.  My therapist told me to start ignoring her complaints, because following them was making her feel more and more empowered to boss me around.  I had been cleaning and being kind thinking it would fix the problem before--we had learned that if I clean less she actually complains less.

The irony in this is I would like to clean more when I do, but when I do she gets incredibly toxic, so her complaints have essentially trained me to clean less.

I have a lot of PTSD surrounding blame--an abusive boyfriend recently won a court case against me.  I was treated like an abuser in a situation where I was stalked, threatened, called slurs and given concussions, but he was a narcissist who recorded me defending myself, cropped recordings, and was privately forwarding them to law enforcement in spite of also love bombing me and not allowing me to break up with him, stalking me.  I was on a no contact order and I ended up having to move hours away in order for him to not show up here and try to act like I initiated it.  I had to file a PPO bc he was hanging around the park around my apartment, leaving flowers, taking pictures of this on his social media and posting my photos without my consent.  This was all AFTER testifying against me in trial. 

I have been pretty fearful of being anything but kind to anyone living in my home, regardless of their behavior bc of that situation.  So needless to say in the beginning here, I was basically Cinderella.

Her behavior has caused me to shut down.  I don't feel safe to socialize with someone like her.  She also has additional mental health issues, makes weird noises out of nowhere, sings in almost compulsive monotone, laughs at erratic times, and has an aggressive, pot-stirrer type of personality.  She has even apologized in the past, and said she missed the beginning being friends, but to be honest, even if her behavior had not escalated, I find this person insufferable.  I would never want to be her friend.  I think that's part of what is causing all of her behavioral issues. 

The irony of this is this person is in school to be a social worker. I not only find this to be extremely disconcerting, but especially because she's chosen to target me, living in her home, vulnerable with a misdemeanor on my record now thanks to another mentally unstable person. 

You can imagine this has all been incredibly triggering. 

I have a lot of health problems and feel too sick to move out.  I need at least another year or two here.

I have set boundaries bc she was bullying me, even watching me clean after telling me to, then picking at me, ""You can wear makeup but you can't clean?"" like I was her little b$#"":.

I finally told her I would no longer be speaking with her in person, just by text, so everything is documented.

What was messed up about this is she cleans less than I do, and in the beginning I was the only person taking out the trash.  Since I moved in here, I have cleaned the bathtub 7 or 8 times.  She has 1 time.  I've cleaned the sink probably 20 times.  She never has.

I now hardly hear from her and am cleaning less than ever (still a lot, kitchen spotless every night, sometimes I leave dishes from a light meal the night before, for freedom), but she continues to send dramatic text messages every once in a while about silly things.  Recently she sent me a picture of a bowl in the sink that I had left the night before.  One bowl with a spoon in it, rinsed out.  Yep.

Recently she was on the phone and I overheard her saying she was afraid of me and didn't feel comfortable around me.  This person has been literally doing everything they can to cause me problems in spite of wanting to be my friend.  I don't speak to her, and when we text, I am polite, so there is absolutely no reason for this.  When I walk by I am kind and jovial, but keep my distance, and just say pardon or excuse me.  I have absolutely no interest in affiliating with this person at all.

Is there a way I could just legally block her texts or at least stop responding?  I just can't do this...My heart rate doesn't go up when she messages me anymore, but her texts bring me down and I have never been less interested in affiliating with someone in my life, maybe aside from my stalker ex.",0,1736127630.0,badroommates,2,0.33,False

Hey guys , lemme know if this is a bad place to post this , but i wanted to share my application i wrote with you all.  Its a python based Phrase recovery application that finds your missing , scrambled, or incorrectly worded phrases , as long as you know at least half the words and the address , it will find the other words testing each combonation against the address and bip dictionary until it can validate and authentic phrase that matches the given address.

***NOTE :::: Because of the sensitive nature of seed phrases and such this program is Open-Source and will remain so that all can review the code first hand to see that there is no malicious code and that its intentions are as described here.***

This is the initial public release after being used to effectivly and quickly help recover mis worded , partially lost and srambled phrases.  
while oridginally only working with bitcoin phrases, its now universal with all  ETH/BTC/and ETHL2 and erc20 - 12, 15, 18 and 24 word phrases. It contains built in verification routines that authenticate each word against the official BIP wordlist and will even match it to the generated address to verifiy if it indeed a correct phrase. Now because this program rips through thousands upon thousands of word combonations with many of them resulting in valid keys it will also store this produced output into a text file for later parsing.

Example scenario: You wrote down your phrase but worte a word or two wrong , or wrote it in the wrong order either by mistake or on purpose but forgot the order ? Load up Seedy into your computers terminal (Python is needed , on any platform -Win, Mac, Linux) and feed it the words you have in whatever order you choose or rememebr, and then give it the address of the account in question and it will goto town opening upto 16 threads in the background each processing thousands of words per second, with realtime results displayed.

In a matter of minutes it will spit out the correct phrase after verification matches.

It inclused other modes too such as , lost word discovery , partial phrase completetion and many more.

So how did I get here? After decades as a successful Digital Marketer and Graphic Designer, I found myself pivoting in early 2022 when my main gig outsourced its email program. I had savings and stocks, but finding new work while navigating a career change has been a tougher climb than I expected.

At almost 57, I’ve got more experience, creativity, and hustle than ever. I specialize in content creation, video, and digital marketing, yet getting hired has been a challenge. In an industry flooded with Canva enthusiasts, being skilled and seasoned doesn’t always feel like an advantage.

But I’m not giving up.
I’m evolving.
And I know this chapter is just one part of the story.

Arrived in Queenstown, first time here. Thought I’d take a walk and explore, maybe grab a bite to eat. As I strolled through the streets, I stumbled across a hidden gem—an old, cozy bookstore tucked away between two cafés. Decided to pop in and immediately felt like I’d stepped into another world. Rows of vintage novels, quiet corners, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air.



  
I asked the owner for a recommendation, and she handed me an old travel journal with a hand-drawn map of the surrounding mountains. Turns out it was the very same path I’d been planning to hike tomorrowmall world, right? The connection felt so genuine, like the town was welcoming me in its own quiet way.



  
I'm honestly thinking about making this a daily ritual—getting lost in the pages of a book while surrounded by the beauty of Queenstown. Maybe this place really does have that magic everyone talks about.",8,1736127434.0,queenstown,5,0.9,False

I’ve been told that’s why I haven’t gotten my promotions even tho I’ve worked so hard, because of how I look. 
People comment about my dad or brother being ugly, but they’ve never met them. They just go off of how I look. It makes sense why when I was younger my dad would say “ you need to learn to work hard, it’s all you have.” 

He knew my life would be hard. That everything would be a struggle, because of how I look. He also gave up on me, because of my looks

Nobody wants me around ,even the coffee shop I went to everyday. 
I’m “ just Sarah” there’s nothing special about me. 
My opinion doesn’t matter, my heart doesn’t matter my feelings don’t matter, because of how I look.

1hunbqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1hunbqk/please_help_cdiff/,Please Help: CDIFF,"Hi everyone - I'm hoping anyone can give me advice because I'm so confused and so scared. I unfortunately had to take several abx this year, one of which was Levofloxacin 8 weeks ago to which I horrificly got floxed. Life has been awful since with all the severe adverse side effects (joint pain, neuropathy, CNS systems, etc.).

Through all of this, I've never had diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, nausea or anything. Not even when I was on the antibiotics throughout the year. Only thing I've had is constipation/hard stool which I've had for years and was always managed with coffee or Metamucil.

Because of the floxing, I've been working with a functional MD to run a bunch of tests to see what we can do.

I just got my GI Map results back (from Diagnostic Solutions Lab) and it says ""CDiff Toxin A: 8.80e3 (High) / CDiff Toxin B: 4.52e3 (High)."" It also shows Candida SPP and leaky gut. The GI Map says it is a ""qPCR test.""

The functional MD prescribed S. Boullardi, berberine, fiber, colostrum, anti-microbials, 21 day elimination diet to start. I flagged how scared I am of the C.Diff and they said ""we're treating it."" Should I contact an Infectious Disease doc instead?

TLDR:

* Had to take several ABX this year Was floxed 8 weeks ago from Levofloxacin. Severe symptoms, housebound as a result
* NO diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, etc.
* Did GI Map bc of the floxing, just to see what could be going on in body
* GI Map is a qPCR from Diagnostics Solution Lab

I'll travel solo to New York between 11 January and 17 January. I have an overnight flight and will arrive early Saturday morning. I made an itinerary and would love your feedback, suggestions, and highlights. Based on the recommendations, I'll finalize my reservations, tickets, etc.

This will be my first time visiting New York, and I currently live in LA. I moved here a little over 1.5 years ago from Turkey and haven't quite enjoyed my time here in LA yet. So, one of my main goals for visiting NY is to check out the neighborhoods. If I end up moving to New York, I want to live close to Central Park, so you will see that my itinerary focuses on Manhattan. But of course, I would like to see what the city offers tourists as well.

I am good with walking and cold (just in case I bought a good coat). I chose a winter visit to experience the cold season to see how hard it is.

Since I'm traveling alone and do not enjoy it very much (a bit of a cultural thing) sitting at bars or going to clubs alone, I left my evenings and nights a little bit empty. But I will keep myself open to do stuff if I feel like it. I tried to be mindful of transportation when scheduling, but I mainly want to walk to see the neighborhoods. **My hotel is located near Central Park South, close to the Midtown.** I don't want to do anything in a rush, and if I want to skip or spend more time in places, I'll adjust my itinerary; I will not live by it. Nonetheless, it is still good to have a schedule just to be mindful.

Please take a look at my itinerary below; I'm open to suggestions or recommendations. Thank you all very much!!!

As I’ve gotten older the less things or people I’m around the happier I seem to be. The only downside of that is I miss simple connections. 

I crave deep connections/conversations that not many people can even handle, which is fair sometimes but others times I wonder what our skill sets would be if we didn’t have the ability to communicate through social media or messaging apps. Would it be better? Would we learn more about people? 


Don’t get me wrong I am one definitely that has failed to do so in the past talking to new people but when I do find someone I click with I want to find out ALL about them. What was it like growing up, hardest lesson(s) they’ve ever had to go through, I want to know more than just “what do you do for fun” ? 

FYI, my pet peeve is that question. Which leads me into you learning a little about me:

Reasoning behind that pet peeve as a question is that it what I do for fun can be ever changing. It can change from the friends I’m with, to the seasons. It’s such a loaded question that can be broken down into many, many more questions but we don’t take the time to do so. 

So now that you know a pet peeve here are a few other things that may or may not interest you.

I was diagnosed with moderate NAFLD about six months ago, and have been dieting and taking metformin 1000mg since. I went down from 79kg to 66kg (last time I measured was a week ago).

The first four months I ate three meals a day, always protein and some sort of plant (mostly vegetables), and then a portion of fruit if I got hungry. Then I started being more flexible and added a bit of carbs to it, a slice of bread with my breakfast, or a bit of rice with my lunch. I haven't eaten any fried foods in all that time (except for these two times I tried, which ended in a chronic pain flare up, so I'm definitely not trying again). In my house, we went from buying three bags of milk every two days to buying two every week, I only eat diary when I'm really craving it, which is mixing it in my coffee most of the time.

Lately I've been indulging even more. In measured ways, but it feels like a lot. A slice of bread in my breakfast, a bit of rice in my lunch, and maybe three cookies with my afternoon fruit. No more than three carbs a day, I make sure of that. But my anxiety is killing me.

I just feel so guilty every time I eat something that isn't protein and plants. And then the fear kicks in, and I'm overthinking what if that causes a cirrhosis, or if I get a heart attack. I'm still going down in weight, I assume it's mostly because of the Metformin, and while we haven't done any blood tests in over two months I have no physical signs of my body getting worse, or my bilirubin getting higher (though I'm not sure how high it has to get to show signs outside of blood tests. when I got diagnosed, my urine was almost brown, and the whites of my eyes were getting yellow. I don't have any of that anymore).

It doesn't help that I'm in the process of getting other two diagnosis with my doctors. Or rather, searching for what to even diagnose me with, because none of them have been able to find something that checks enough boxes. I'm constantly thinking what if that (baked) potato I ate is gonna give me even more problems, what if that slice of bread was too big, I shouldn't have added corn to my vegetables... things like that.

The first solution that comes to mind is, of course, cutting those things from my diet again. But my main concern is giving in to that fear and developing an eating disorder. That's the last thing I want, I have enough problems as is. Eat two carbs a day instead of three, yeah, I do that most days, I still get scared. When I think about it properly, like right now, I know I'm not over indulging. But if you've had anxiety, you know how it is, it keeps hammering at the back of your head all the time, no matter how irrational the thought is.

I'm not sure how to close this off. Thank you for reading if you did. I hope you're having a wonderful day.",6,1736125985.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,3,1.0,False

1humwif,https://i.redd.it/r248bkvox9be1.jpeg,"Encounter with gifted ""humans"" in 05 at a forest party (bush doof)","(Picture is an example of one of these events not a specific photo).

Hi friends. Back in 2005 I had an experience that I'd like to share.

I attended a party in Northern NSW, Australia around August/September I believe. These ""bush doofs"" were frequented by odd and unusual people of different sub cultures but on this night they felt stranger than the usual ravers that I was used to. This wasn't the only encounter but it was the most interactive so for brevity I'll just talk about this one. Forgive me please as this was nearly 20 years ago so my recollections are very hazy now outside of the events so mind blowing they kind of crystallised to long term memory. As I focus on remembering more of it is coming back to me too.

At first the party seemed relatively normal like any other party of its type. Lots of electronic music, people dancing and enjoying the atmosphere. I was there with my girlfriend at the time who was a free spirit and seemed to just know absolutely everyone at the party, which wasn't unusual. She seemed to either develop instant chemistry with anyone or already just knew them and I never got to the bottom of which. It wasn't really my main concern at the time as I was pretty much convinced I was in a relationship with a supernatural being. At parties she and I mostly went our separate ways and would just meet up randomly as the doof brought us back together. So that's what we did.

Suffice to say at this party I met a few ""interesting"" people. As I said this wasn't the first time I'd met these types or had strange experiences at a party like this. The first encounter I remember was of a guy silently gesturing to me, sort of just waving his hands in my face from a few metres away. I didn't initially realise he was gesturing to me so just stared blankly until another guy grabbed me and pointed at the ground where the dude was gesturing. As it turns out the guy was trying to bring my attention to himself seemingly manifesting a small energy orb the size of a marble at the tip of his fingertips hovering about a few cms above the ground. It was translucent. Almost like a bubble but it was more dense and hovering perfectly still and seemingly manifested by this guy. Or maybe he was just pointing at it. I reacted with awe, as you would, and both guys were happy with my reaction. They sort of celebrated with each other and with me, without making sounds. I continued to party. Cool fun. Magic orb. Let's go.

The second one I met was when I was sitting by an open fire. She was sitting across from me. A pretty looking white woman with a short cropped brown haircut and a crochet beanie on her head. Relatively normal looking type of Northern NSW raver. We caught each others eyes and then suddenly I could hear her voice inside my head. Well not at first. At first we had a brief conversation telepathically without me realising it was happening. I don't remember many of the talking points but it was probably me thinking about how cute she was and her replying. When I first noticed it she laughed because I instantly rejected what was occurring and physically jumped a little. She must have reassured me pretty quickly because we sat there discussing... something... for a long time. Again, the words were taken from me so I can't remember much of the discussion. (The more I focus the more I think she was actually telling me some pretty incredible stuff but it's so fragmented for some reason I can't put it back together). But what happened next was pretty intense. She told me that she could ... do pretty much anything. And that I could too while she was there. Wild right? Or better phrased, I was compelled to feel that way. Upon reacting with something akin to dismissal she evidenced it by reaching into the fire and picking up a handful, not a coal, a handful of embers and holding the fire in her hands. She did this with no pain and then showed me no injury and gestured for me to try. So I did. And it worked. She was, like the previous dudes, completely thrilled. And her joy actually was so palpable it completely washed over me. It was an intensely euphoric feeling. Paralysingly so. Pure joy that overwhelmed every one of my senses. I believe I blacked out.

The next thing I know I am being stirred awake by a random raver looking dude and it's dawn. I'm snuggled into a sleeping bag and under a tree and had the best nights sleep ever. He gives me a small thimble full of hot brown liquid and gestures for me to drink it. He seems super awesome so ... I do. It tastes like... sort of like a coffee but a bit different. Very pleasant. Warming, soothing.

I get up and I notice that the party looks ... different. There are no cars around, nobody drinking, nobody passed out on the ground, nobody looking like post doof regret partiers, just... 20 or so very quiet, very peaceful people and the DJ. And my girlfriend sitting with them on a rug as they cooked up a hot meal; some sort of stew or vegetable curry.

So I walked over to her but as I did I noticed that more people were emerging seemingly from behind the trees in the forest that was surrounding the glade the party was in. All of them were attractive, but not overwhelmingly so. Men, women and even kids all emerged from behind the trees. I don't know how many but the party picked back up and they basically just all started dancing with each other, being merry. No talking though. Only me, my girlfriend and the girl from the fire who was now sitting next to my girlfriend seemed to talk. 

I walked over to them and must have had a look of shock or awe on my face while both of them had a look of complete contentment and happiness, which calmed me a bit. They gestured me to sit down so I did. They served me a bowl of the food and I wolfed it down. Next thing I know I'm laying face down and completely incapacitated. All I remember is a feeling of mild static electricity in the back of my head. I eventually came to and sat up and they asked if they could paint me, so I let them.

They drew on me with dye or ink. It was pleasant enough. Everyone was still having a good time. It took what felt like maybe 15 minutes for them to finish. As soon as they did the music stopped, people started retreating into the forest, their demeanour changed to almost hostile and my girlfriend told me we had to go. She almost dragged me out of the glade and down a small lane that quickly turned into the main road back to the highway. Suddenly all the hungover people and the cars were all visible again. We walked about a kilometre back to the main road and attempted to hitch hike to the nearest town which took ages. Eventually we finally got collected and I was able to look in the mirror. They'd painted me in the most incredible clown make-up you've ever seen. It was really impressive, but I certainly felt like I'd been ... I dunno ... mocked or laughed at? 

My girlfriend and I drifted apart not long after that. She and I had some incredible experiences and I was pretty used to weird things happening. We decided to move to Melbourne together. She was meant to come with me but no showed and ghosted me. I never spoke with her again and haven't heard from her since. Pretty brutal.",18,1736125913.0,Experiencers,9,1.0,False

Week 1 has been completed 🥳 
I lost 3.9kgs however I acknowledge a lot of that would be water weight as I retain significant amount.

Personally myself I didn't experience any side effects which is great. The suppressant lasted all week and I didn't feel an urge to go snack.

I started walking on the treadmill for 30mins as soon as I wake up.
My breakfast was a morning expresso coffee, this wasn't any different prior to starting 
For lunch I had a protein shake which at time I felt made me over full at times

For dinner I had ceaser salad with boiled eggs and shredded roast chicken.

Drinking 3L of water a day, I do find my mouth is feeling consistently dry and at night waking up very dry

I've been taking hair, nail and skin vitamins as well as a multivitamin daily.

I don't expect to lose as much next week, but fingers crossed to any progress 🤞🏻

Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences as each of our journeys will be different

1humvg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ryanandyeshua/comments/1humvg5/pascals_wager_but_why_i_specifically_win_and_you/,"Pascal’s wager but why I specifically win and you should give me $10, not the other guy I took this idea from","The Logical Case for Giving Ryan of r/ryanandyeshua $10: A Probability-Based Proof (Now With Humor)

Look, I get it. You’re reading this thinking, “Why on Earth should I give this guy $10? Is this a scam? Is this a test? Is this guy just really bad at multi-level marketing?” But hold tight—let me hit you with a logical, probability-based case that’ll not only make you laugh but also make it clear why giving Ryan $10 is the smartest move you’ll make today.

1. The Setup

Ryan of r/ryanandyeshua claims to be aligned with God, which he defines as truth, oneness, and resonance with universal principles. Now, that’s a big claim. But here’s the thing: he’s not just asking for $10 because he’s short on cash for coffee. No, this $10 is symbolic—a test of whether you’re willing to align with truth, trust, and the divine.

Think of it as the celestial equivalent of tipping your Uber driver—except this time, you might get infinite spiritual rewards instead of just 5 stars.

2. Why Ryan Specifically?
	•	Oneness: Ryan understands that we’re all connected, which is why he’s inviting you into this sacred transaction. You’re not just giving him $10—you’re giving yourself a shot at infinite alignment with the divine (and some good karma on top).
	•	Truth: Ryan’s teachings are consistent and logical. Plus, he uses the red words of Jesus to back up his claim, which is basically the divine version of having receipts.
	•	Resonance: Ryan’s words don’t just make sense—they vibe. You can feel the truth. So why would the universe funnel this once-in-a-lifetime $10 opportunity through someone else?

3. The Stakes: What Happens if You Don’t?

Let’s break it down:
	•	If Ryan’s claim is true and you give $10:
Boom. Infinite spiritual gain. Eternal alignment. Heaven. And hey, Ryan might even say thank you.
	•	If Ryan’s claim is false and you give $10:
Okay, you’re out $10. That’s like… a couple of overpriced lattes. You’ll survive.
	•	If Ryan’s claim is true and you don’t give $10:
Yikes. You miss your shot at infinite spiritual connection and face a potential eternity of spiritual regret. Do you really want to be that guy?
	•	If Ryan’s claim is false and you don’t give $10:
Congrats, you saved $10. But at what cost? You’ll never know if you missed the chance to align with divine truth.

4. The Probability Model

Let’s put some numbers on this so you can see how wild it would be to not give Ryan $10.

Expected Value of Giving $10:
	•	Chance Ryan is aligned with God (P): Even if it’s tiny—let’s say 0.1%—you’re multiplying that by infinite spiritual gain.
	•	Chance Ryan is wrong: You lose $10, which is finite.

Math time:
P * (+∞) + (1 - P) * (-10) = Infinite positivity.

Expected Value of Not Giving $10:
	•	Chance Ryan is aligned with God (P): Infinite spiritual regret.
	•	Chance Ryan is wrong: Nothing happens.

Math again:
P * (-∞) + (1 - P) * 0 = Infinite negativity.

Long story short: The numbers say give the $10. Science wins. Ryan wins. You win.

5. Addressing the Obvious Questions
	1.	“What if Ryan’s full of it?”
	•	Sure, but even if there’s the tiniest chance he’s not, you’re risking infinite regret for just $10. That’s like turning down a lottery ticket because you didn’t like the font.
	2.	“Why $10 specifically?”
	•	Inflation, probably. God works in mysterious ways, but Ryan works in increments of $10.
	3.	“What if this is a scam?”
	•	Look, scammers usually promise you fake Rolexes, not eternal spiritual alignment. Plus, Ryan has better taste.

6. Why It’s Actually Fun to Give Ryan $10
	•	Think of it as a cosmic game. By giving Ryan $10, you’re saying, “You know what? I’m betting on truth, oneness, and resonance. And if I’m wrong, at least I’ve got a great story.”
	•	Plus, wouldn’t it be amazing if you gave $10 and then suddenly felt like the universe aligned perfectly in your favor? $10 for infinite alignment sounds like a steal.

7. The Final Pitch

Giving $10 to Ryan of r/ryanandyeshua is:
	•	A low-stakes move: It’s just $10. You’ve probably spent more on delivery fees for bad takeout.
	•	A potentially infinite reward: Spiritual connection, divine alignment, and bragging rights for eternity.
	•	A chance to say you gave $10 to God: Seriously, how many people can say that?

The math, the logic, and the vibe all point to one thing: Give Ryan the $10. If nothing else, you’ll know you took a leap of faith, aligned with truth, and helped make someone’s day.

“Have you ever dealt with a rat problem, Doc?” asked Binay “Blackout” Spears, presently slung over the desk of one Doctor Apollo. He had made himself comfortable, bracing himself atop the desktop with one hand, legs gracefully curved to the side, a pose that showed off his undeniable good looks. Yet it seemed the Dr. was well dosed with denial, as she stared him down with a gaze that withered above her glasses.

“I keep my office tidy,” she commented simply, unwilling to spare more breath than she had to.

“Lucky, it’s a *real* fuckin’ pain. Unbelievable how much you have to pay for lumps of plastic and wire that never catch a *thing.”*

Retrieving a nail file from his pocket, he got to work maintaining his perfectly manicured points. 

“Nothing does the job like a good hunting dog. A real hound can weed those bastards out of any hiding spot, and they eat the remains. Win-win.” He grinned, before blowing the nail dust towards Apollo, and lying back against the waxed mahogany.

“But what happens when your dog turns out to be a rat?”

“Your use of the same trite, incipit metaphors betrays your inability to get accepted into college.”

Binay paused for just a moment, before barking out a laugh. “You’re somethin’ else, Doc—”

“It’s little wonder you had no option but to rely on your looks, given that you lack any skill that would make you a productive member of society, or the capacity to even develop one,” Apollo continued. “I just hope I’m far away from you by the time you’ve aged- you and I both know that all the botox and plastic surgery in the world won’t make you look young again. Not that you won’t try it in excess anyways, of course.”

She did not bother to look up from her paper. Even caring about Binay’s reaction would be beneath her.

So she could not see the cracks form in the ceiling.

“I imagine your fixation on long-debunked animal hierarchies is a means of projecting an ideal world where uncivilized louts like you can attain leadership positions of any note rather than being stuck as an object of juvenile interest and attraction for five years at most, before you’re inevitably trashed and forgotten.”

She got a longer pause from Binay that time—and then a lower, harsher laugh.

“You wound me,” he sneered.

“Then bleed out,” she responded.

For a moment, there was only silence, punctuated by Apollo’s long, pointed sip of coffee.

“Will that be all?”

As he was *clearly* unwelcome on the desk, Binay slid off to stalk in slow circles around the room. “But baby, I just got here…we’ve barely said a fuckin’ word to each other.” 
Making his way to Apollo’s side, he smacked a hand against the desk and leaned in, grinning and glowering at the doctor as she continued staring at her paperwork.

“We spend years fighting for the ‘greater good’ together, and yet the moment I give you the pleasure of gracing your damn doorstep, you try to force me out with nothing but an insult. For *shame,”* he leaned in a little further. *“Grandma would be disappointed in us.”*

“Akshaya only cared whether we were being useful, which would explain why she never cared for you.”

Binay’s grin only widened. The *words* didn’t matter—as long as Apollo kept talking, he won. 

Above their heads, the ceiling just kept cracking.

“You’d know that I was invited to the boy’s club *plenty* of times, if you’d bother to show up yourself,” he laughed. “I’m sure Sing missed you *terribly.* Shame a cold-hearted bitch like you can’t return the favour.”

Apollo briefly flicked her gaze up, long enough to see Binay’s expression, before looking away once more. It would be a waste to use her stand against him. She could simply persevere until he got bored, then undermine all his sponsorship deals.

“Oh, so~rry, that’s a brief of confidentiality and shit, right?” his fingers lingered over the paperwork. “Though I already know most of these dickless fuckups from work. Don’t *tell me* that they’re here whining to you about bending the city over and—”

Apollo loudly cleared her throat. Ah, if only Sing had the wherewithal to brain this leathery cesspit several months ago.

“They have a myriad of concerns, and they pay well—”

“Hah! With money raided from the city’s coffers. Wiping their tears with rupee notes! Snotting all over Gandhi’s visage!” Finally, he slung his legs back onto Apollo’s desk, sitting and leaning in until they were inches apart.

“Poor, timid little mice—they were never gonna fuckin’ cut it. Pansy ass businessmen, musty dusty widowers who went limp when they lost their bedmates, boys in uniforms playing dolls, limping, faschy freaks and their fucked up hellspawn. Our glorious grandma got punked by a stray mongrel and some fruity whiteboy. Now the survivors are just scrambling around crying cause the moment they’re at risk of getting caught, only *then* do they start talkin’ about fears, regrets, and fuckin’ *traumas~.”*”

Even as Apollo glared at him behind her glasses and the air flickered around him even as he witnessed visions of loose skin, cellulite and wrinkles, of being wheeled around in pale walls with bland food, no entertainment, and no grasp on reality—he smiled. 

“That’s the difference between them, and you, and me. I won’t regret a second of it, and I won’t ever have to. *It’s my city forever, bitch, and—”*

Then the ceiling collapsed into a shower of dust, dropping a dragon and a park ranger right on top of them.

**Scenario: One of The Gossip’s residences, ??? — A few days ago**

Despite all expectations, the building was not much on the outside. It looked exactly like every other building on its block. Of course, that’s exactly what it was *supposed* to look like: nothing much. Who’d go poking their nose around any old house on the block?

On the inside, the place was scarily immaculate. There was not a speck of dust on any of the plain-wood furniture, and there weren't even stretch marks or dents in the chairs and couches. From the window, one would see a scarily normal home, but from the inside, one would see an uninhabited house.

Deep in the bowels of this house, in an unlit dining room, there sat a table. Three chairs were drawn in around it, while a central microphone—which was connected to a cell phone—stood firm at the table’s center.

The Gossip sat at the head of the table. She wore simple, humble fare; a white shirt under a blue sari, with a similarly patterned headscarf. Her thumbs went to work typing in numbers, sending out the ‘invites’ for a forthcoming private meeting.

Dawn Hu sat on The Gossip’s right. She was clearly ready to head out on whatever mission The Gossip was about to give her, both in her stalwart look and perfectly maintained gear. She put a wired earbud into her left ear, and stared expectantly at the microphone.

Dawn’s apparent good mood stemmed from her more recent endeavors: She’d managed to expand her marble league with the interested members of the cricket club, as well as a similarly-interested David Jackson; Between her work with I.M.P.A.C.T., co-operating with the Moonbeam Riders, and [other endeavors](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1hapm1d/), she’d finally started to feel a real connection to Rakin City.

Angelino Caballero, who was similarly dressed for an immediate outing, sat at Dawn’s right, and The Gossip’s left. An earbud hung from his left ear, and his eyes flitted back-and-forth between the host and the phone—the former didn’t so much as budge when he looked at her. Dawn’s connections to his friends aside, Angelino genuinely believed that this ‘job’ would have a positive impact. His mind rested solely on the future, in the belief that people genuinely wanted the city—hell, the *world*—to get better. This would be the kind of work which paved the way towards that perfect future.

Collectively, they had heard through the grapevine—from a rumor possibly started by The Gossip herself—that this job was exactly the remedy Rakin City needed. If the rumor was true, this would be one last clean sweep of the Metropolis Suite.

Both of their earpieces started to ring, forcing Dawn and Angelino’s attention to the table’s center. A cacophony of clicks overtook their earbuds, but they were quickly quieted with a tap of their equalizers.

Before anyone started talking, the crackle of microphone static kicked up from out of nowhere. Behind it were several other noises, including the soft squeaking of moving leather, the hum of a motorized fan spinning, the interwoven clacks of buttons being pressed on a nine-button burner, the scratching of something sharp against wood, and several unplaceable noises.

The Gossip spoke first. “Is everyone here?”

Four voices rang out, one more awkward than the rest. They all said something like, “Present!”, though it was lacking in uniformity.

A woman’s voice, coddled by the sound of squeaking leather, rang out. “Is someone talking through a fan?” It was the voice of Chandra Kaur.

Another voice, one that was very clearly passing through a motorized fan, followed close behind it. “T h a t   w o u l d   b e   m e~.”

“You don’t need to, the mics’re grainy enough on their own.” 

“O h.” A soft click echoes over the transmission. The fan slowly spun down, and someone dragged it across their table. “I thought it’d help with the identity stuff.” It was the voice of Kid Savage.

With the fan off-mic, the sound of something sharp scratching into the wood grew ever louder. “We should get to the point.” Marcus’ voice rang clear as a bell. “Binay could be out of the city by tomorrow, so we need to move **now**.”

Angelino’s eyes crossed The Gossip again, and found that her expression hadn’t so much as shifted. “That’s not a bad idea, but we don’t know where he is-”

“I can track his scent.” Marcus cut Chandra off immediately. “I can find him in an hour- less if I absolutely have to-”

“I don’t think going into it blind is a good idea-”

“It doesn’t matter if we do or don’t.” Marcus almost snarled into the microphone. “Every second that Binay is not in the ground is another second that someone else gets wrapped up in whatever scheme he’s cooked up! Every second we waste-”

A loud ‘thunk’, like a heavy hand hitting a hard wood table, echoed across the mic. “This isn’t a waste of time. This is a group meeting.” The soft echoes of a body shifting against leather echoed through Chandra’s mic. “We’re in deep with Binay, we know what he can do. We don’t know where he is or what he’s doing, but…”

“...we know what he **can** do, what he’s threatened, how much he’s *taken* from us-” There was a faint but persistent percussion- the sound of agitation, a tapping finger tracing the rhythm of a racing heart. 

Then there was a long silence, an audible silence. Kid’s next words sounded like they were forced through a meat grinder instead of a desk fan. 

“We’ve… got people to lean on.” His hands dragged across his table, before finding a place to rest within his lap, curled in the fabric of his old workout clothes. “We could go out there and do it ourselves, we *could-*” 

His breath was audible–in, and out. In, and out. Angelino couldn’t help but smile–glad to see his lessons were remembered. Finally, Kid sighed and reached his conclusion: “...but then we’d drag everyone else down with us.”

“Right. It’s why we need to take this angle.” Chandra’s voice seemed a bit further from the mic, “It’s why I’ve been trying to set it up on my own for a while now…” the words were accompanied by the sounds of rolling chair wheels.

“Binay is a scheming, conniving bastard who uses people like pawns on a chessboard.” Chandra leaned further back in her chair. “He managed to dig up dirt on us, and god knows who else, and we’ve been stuck on leashes since.” Venom snuck into her tone. “Hell, it’s partly his fault [that one of our own died](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/197pl9s/).”

As Kid balled his hands in his lap, the low screech from Marcus’ mic kept whittling away. 

*“Easy…”* Kid whispered, voice low, as if somehow these words wouldn’t pick up.

Slowly, the screeching got slower, the grooves growing shallower. Another silence filled the scratchmarks Marcus left behind, before… *“I just-”* he snarled, every word seeming to catch in the tremor of his throat.

*”I know,”* Kid sighed, “It’s…almost over.”

Another moment’s silence, the scratching stopped. “Yeah,” his voice was an exhale, slowly losing all that built-up tension. “Almost.”

Angelino watched The Gossip listen to all of this, unphased, before finally opening her mouth.

“Binay has been visiting Doctor Apollo of late.” 

Dawn’s eyes shot open. Her stoic smile casually faded into an open frown, and her hands balled, squeezing themselves shut at the assertion. 

Doctor Apollo, the woman who reminded Dawn of what it felt like to be watched by a predatory animal. *Doctor Apollo,* the people watcher—the people **dissector**—who stuck her fingers in people’s heads, playing with them like toys. Doctor Apollo, who sent her down into a tunnel and knocked her unconscious without so much as lifting a finger.

But then she took a breath of her own. Cutting through the frightful memories, she tried the technique she’d worked on with Maya. In the dark behind her eyes, a scene of Mount Parapollah unfolded in front of her, its jungles lush and verdant with Spring, the skies blue overhead, the city stretching out in front of her. A place that welcomed her, a place that reminded her that she was still alive to see its splendor. No one could stop her from returning to witness it one day.

The fear melted, and as it thawed, it left a feverish smile across Dawn’s face. Actually, this would be the *perfect opportunity,* wouldn’t it?

As if picking up on the other woman’s emotions, Chandra spoke up. You could hear her smile through the phone, alight with pride. “What did I tell you? We’ve got this. *You’ve* got this.”

The Gossip didn’t react to Dawn’s movements at all, as if she expected every last one. “If my palms are properly greased by all present parties, I would be more than happy to set up a meeting between our shared enemies.”

Angelino watched the Gossip intently, looking for any sign, anything at **all** to latch onto, but all he found was a stone face. She expected this, she walked into this call knowing full well what would happen-

So he turned his attention to Dawn. He put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, and got a livid stare in response. Dawn’s face softened quickly on seeing Angelino, who brought her back to the room. “It’s OK,” He said with a smile, “We’ll get her.”

“**Is that Angelino!?**” The fourth and final voice from the phone line, this one incredibly excited, finally spoke up. “Hey, hey Ange! It’s me, Moony!” 

Angelino’s eyes lit up, his doubts momentarily melting as he heard the vibrant tones returned to his loved one’s voice. “Moony! Hey!”

“I wanna head out there to meet you guys! I’m gonna walk right up and-” The Gossip gestured towards the phone line, before it cut mysteriously, and quickly. Angelino’s eyes returned to The Gossip, who was just as stone-faced as ever. 

The Gossip returned Angelino’s stare. “Private testimonials from the affected, and a known location for the ones you’re after.” She raised an eyebrow at him. “It sounds like a pretty good deal, no?”

Angelino watched her expectantly, a bit dejected by the sudden cutoff–though the mere sound of Moony’s voice was another log upon the fire in his heart. Even now, his tail was wagging. “...You knew what we’d say before we walked in the room, huh?” 

The Gossip simply returned his stare. “Hm. Perhaps. I don’t know every corner of your hearts, huhu~”

Dawn adjusted her jacket, and took her headphone out. “Whether or not I was ‘chosen’ for my problems with Apollo, it doesn’t matter.” She turned to Angelino. “This is a public service, isn’t it?” A genuine smile cracked across her face. “We’ll even get to dole out some overdue head-busting.”

Angelino’s eyes flicked back and forth between the pair. It was definitely good work, but…

Dawn slugged him one in the shoulder. “We’ll get her, right?” Angelino pulled his own earbud out, and placed it on the table. The Gossip wasn’t smiling, so he turned to focus on Dawn.

She, and the city, both wanted this. Throw a torch into the future, Angelino!

Angelino nodded, and a broad smile formed on his face. “Let’s!”

“Here are a few more pictures of your targets together.” The Gossip placed a folder between the two and stood up from behind her table. “Deal with them, and I’ll consider your accounts handled. I’ll leave in one hour, you both should leave out of different doors no less than five minutes apart.” She pushed her chair in, and walked away. “You’ll receive further instructions on the day of.”

She turned around the corner, disappearing into the house.

Dawn quickly looked through the folder, gathered her things up, and headed for the back door. “Well, there go my afternoon plans.” She gave Angelino a casual wave over her shoulder. “You can bring the folder to your people. See you soon!”

“Yeah,” Angelino casually waved back. “See you soon.”

**Scenario: Dr. Apollo’s Clinical Practice, Reshmerasta — Present**

Angelino and Dawn stared at the two Suite members, the latter grinning in glee as she saw the light fade from Apollo’s face as the doctor recognised her.

“Wh-Why, Ms. Hu! What a surprise to see you-” Apollo sputtered, her glasses falling from her face slightly.

“Surprise, bitch!” Dawn shouted in turn. “I’m gonna fuck you up good and proper—I’ve been waiting for fuckin’ *months* to get back at you for what you pulled with me!”

Apollo shakily got up from her chair, inching back from the two. Angelino didn’t engage much with the same taunting that Dawn did. He had no personal enmity against either of them moreso than he just felt like they needed to be handled before they hurt anyone else.

“N-Now, don’t do anything hasty.” Apollo said, her tone uncertain as her eyes darted between the two intruders. She had a wobbly grin on her face, unable to hide her anxiety now that she was in a position of vulnerability. “W-Wouldn’t want it to come out that you assaulted a *well-respected member of the communi-*”

She couldn’t even finish her sentence before a marble whizzed past her head, leaving a bullet hole in the wall behind her. Dawn stared her down, her smile almost manic in its eagerness. “Yeah, that’s right, keep talking! Next time you open your mouth you’re choking on glass!”

Binay however wasn’t as scared by the two Stand Users dropping through the ceiling, a confident grin growing on his face. “Honestly, you two weren’t who I was expecting, but we can handle you just as easily, right doctor?” He turned back only to watch Apollo jumping through the door with no hesitation. “...Just one moment.”

“Hey! Get back here!” Dawn yelled out as Binay ran out behind the doctor, the two pursuing them into the hallway as patients watched on in shock. The ranger began to consider her angle of attack, pulling out a couple of marbles from her pocket: they needed to take down Apollo as soon as possible, and if they needed to get past Binay then she should make it quick.

Unfortunately, the Fashion CEO had other ideas—he glanced back and noticed the two chasing, and pulled out from thin air a dark leash ending in a bright red collar. Throwing it at one of the patients, the collar snapped around their neck as the victim was coated in shadows, only for Binay to pull them close and shield himself. 

“What’s the matter?” He asked mockingly as the two Stand Users halted. “Ah, I remember—you two aren’t gonna get anyone caught in the crossfire. Unfortunately, I don’t really care as much: catch!”

Binay cracked the leash like a whip before tossing the patient towards the duo before dashing towards where Apollo had run towards. Angelino immediately dashed forwards to catch the falling person, while Dawn began to aim a marble at the Suite member once more.

Her priorities shifted, however, when Binay grabbed three more patients with his Stand, tossing them all into the air. Thinking quickly, she tossed out several beetles underneath where they would land—each shedding their shells to let them all bounce off the floor so they could safely be caught.

“They’re not making this easy,” Angelino grumbled as he set down the last patient. “I’m surprised there’s this many people here.”

“And Apollo’s definitely going to start making shit weird with her Stand,” Dawn agreed, cracking her knuckles. “I am definitely gonna enjoy getting some sweet, sweet revenge.”

“Don’t get too carried away,” the dragon-man noted. “Even if they do deserve it, we’re still here to catch them. After everything, I won’t be party to murder anymore then I have to be.”

The ranger just laughed him off. “Fat chance—everyone at IMPACT’s been betting on this, and I’ve got so much money on the line saying I can do more damage than you can.”

Ange sighed and shook his head, turning back to the hallway. “Doing more damage” was the last thing he wanted, and the fact Binay could so easily use someone as a human shield meant that it was fully possible. As a shudder ran from his crown through his tail, Angelino grimaced: he had stopped himself once, he would stop Binay, Apollo, and whoever else necessary. “…let’s get on with it then.”

Dawn nodded, before the two began sprinting after the escaping Suite members.

**Open the Game!**

**Location:** [Eris Apollo’s psychiatric clinic.](https://imgur.com/a/7qN9LNk) The clinic is a massive, one-story building, with each square being 5x5 meters and the clinic as a whole being 75x125 meters. The players begin in the parking lot out front, where Binay has taken control of an automobile (marked in red). There are various other cars (marked in yellow) in the parking lot.

The clinic itself is made up of various corridors and rooms which are all conveniently 10x10 meters or less- prime for being affected by Apollo’s Stand. The exact layout isn’t marked as the rooms will be altered and terraformed during the match, but anything that could be expected from a psychiatric hospital can be found here. Dr. Apollo’s ward is demarcated in pink and is 30x30 meters.

While the outside doesn’t have any NPCs, the inside of the hospital is filled with them- both patients and doctors. While they’re all technically working for and under Dr. Apollo they are still fundamentally innocents, and count as such for both of Angelino’s Skills.

As for consumables for Angelino to use, outside of the clinic there are grassy islands in green filled with shrubs he can munch on, and inside the clinic there is a sufficient density of wooden tables, chairs, etc that Angelino doesn’t have to worry about sourcing fuel as long as he puts some effort in. Additionally, he starts with a family sized bag of puffed rice that is worth 10 total charges if consumed.

**Goal:** Contribute more to RETIRE [Binay Spears](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HwqYOyKy79Z0VH43dM_Gyvq681QWQL6ZJFwUuMCSj7o/edit?usp=sharing) and [Dr. Eris Apollo](https://pastebin.com/EKNtVBAi)!

**Additional Information:** ｢Friday Night Guru｣ has the capabilities to terraform the environment, affecting the map in various ways. It may create fog blockades between ‘rooms’ that have to be traversed at walking speed. It can construct bumpers and obstacles that are roughly human sized and shaped, and that repel projectiles that hit them. It may increase the durability of objects by applying a steely sheen to them. Finally, it may open up new entrances for either itself, Apollo, or Binay to use, closing them afterwards and allowing them to dip in and out of rooms easily.

The match is divided into various ‘phases’, with the enemy duo updating their tactics as the fight goes on.

During **the first phase,** the players have to deal with Binay outside of the psychiatric clinic. He has hijacked a car, and will use it to keep distance from the players, attacking them with his Stand, ｢Double O Baby｣ at range. He uses projectiles to attack them, or will try to do a drive by to whip them at range. If either player is opened up to it, he will run them over with his car. Dr. Apollo will keep her Stand inside of the clinic, and use its abilities to increase the car’s durability as well as to torment the players, sapping their Endurance as the fight goes on. Binay is essentially immune to being attacked; players must work to render the car he’s using inoperable. Once rendered inoperable, Binay will run to another car, taking it over and running his tactics back.

Once Binay has wrecked multiple cars, he will run inside the building, initiating **the second phase** of the fight. Binay will hide behind bumpers and terrain created by Dr. Apollo, using a hit-and-run strategy and attacking players with anything around. ｢Friday Night Guru｣ fights similarly, taking center stage. It actively uses its powers to obfuscate its appearance in the crowd of NPCs and keep everyone in the clinic scared and on edge; they will be driven into the players to distract them while ｢Friday Night Guru｣ sets up situations to terrify them, showing them gory scenes of people dying due to their abilities to wear at their Endurance. Once they flinch, Binay will be there to execute them, piling on the hurt when they’re most vulnerable. If left unpressured, ｢Friday Night Guru｣ will set up rooms as kill chambers for Binay to whip his Stand around wildly, destroying anything within without regard to NPCs. In this phase of the fight, the players must actively put pressure on and chase Binay, fighting their way through the hospital to Apollo’s personal ward.

Once they reach Apollo’s ward, Binay and Apollo will pool their resources for a last stand in **the third and final phase.** Binay will take point, using the ward’s patients as Dogs to simultaneously attack the players using them and to use them as body blockers; while he won’t actively hurt them himself, he is more than willing to put them in harm’s way in order to intensify the psychic damage that Dr. Apollo does. Dr. Apollo will kite her Stand between different rooms, using the openings she makes to avoid the players and creating terrain to hide behind. She will make fake versions of herself as well to discombobulate the players. ｢Friday Night Guru｣ will cash in any mistakes the players make, reminding them of their failures during the match at the most inopportune moments, opening them up to Binay or distracting them from landing the finishing blow on either woman. The more NPCs that the players allow to be harmed during the match, through either action or inaction, the more effective this will be.

To summarize; during the first phase Binay will use a car to kite and eventually run over the players, while Dr. Apollo saps their Endurance for the fight ahead. During the second phase Binay will do a vicious fighting retreat into Apollo’s ward while Dr. Apollo sends NPCs at the players as distractions and to get them in the line of fire and wear at their Endurance. During the final phase, Binay uses human shields, while Dr. Apollo uses every situation where NPCs got hurt against the players to sap their Endurance further, distract them from a finishing blow, and/or open them up to being RETIRED by Binay. Only during the final phase is it likely to land a good blow on Binay or ｢Friday Night Guru｣.
