1hnnk6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hnnk6f/why_not_end_a_relationship_when_youre_barely/,Why not end a relationship when you're barely participating,"I contemplated a long time if I'm going to make this post but I am in desperate need of some perspective and in turn advice. Please be kind - some of the following topics will be controversial. 

I'll try to keep it as short was possible but I need to get into some detail. 

Short information about me: female, 30, on the autism spectrum, married but in the process of getting a divorce.

  
The story goes as follows.

In late November of 2023 I downloaded Hinge. I wasn't really sure what I was looking for to be completely honest. One day I got this weirdly cute message from a guy (34, Army) telling me, my nose is the most beautiful one he has ever seen before. I told him to tell me more. This is how this all started. 

We texted on Hinge for a few days, then switched over the WhatsApp. Texting went into talking on the phone. We met up the first time in December. I told him about still being married and living with my husband in a roommate situation for financial reasons. He was okay with that. Super casual meet up. We met in the middle, had a few coffees at a random McDonalds and that was it. 

Two weeks later - after hours of talking on the phone and on FaceTime - we met again. He rented a car, picked me up and took me to a christmas market, a restaurant etc. We ended up spending the night. Things were beautiful. I still remember us giggling in bed until early in the morning. The first time things got weird was right after he left the next day. His messages got sparse and I wasn't sure if or when I'm going to see him the next time. However he ended up spending Christmas and New Years with me and my husband (who is like a best friend/brother to me). Every time he wasn't spending time with me though he wasn't really responsive and things started to feel weird. So this was the first time I told him that our ideas of a relationship might differ and that I need him to be consistent. And this is where the Army came in since it is the perfect excuse for everything especially if you on the receiving end are not a member and have no clue about anything. 

Somehow he always ended up responding or calling and I think I was already emotionally invested at this point. Every time a message popped up on my phone the dopamine truly hit. 

It was mid of January of this year when I stayed on base with him for the first time. Since I've never been on an Army base before it was super exciting. He bought so many things for me to make my stay more comfortable which I appreciated. I am an open and direct person and he seemed to match that. So I already knew his ex was from Norway. The first time I was suspicious that things weren't as described was when he opened up Netflix and it was his exes account - everything was in Norwegian of course. He told he still uses it and he forgot his own password. I told him I find that to be disrespectful when they are broken up but I let that slide. 

I work remotely so I have the freedom to stay at random places and work from there which in turn meant that I ended up staying with him even on normal workdays a lot. He wasn't super open about his phone but never ever did it seem like he was hiding something. And I would never just look into a persons phone. But everything was still/already going on in the backround as I had to learn later on. 

Cleaned his room a bit that one day. When I was dusting the top of a dresser (I never opened any drawers since I always respect a persons personal space) and shoved items around I came upon a white nail polish with the name ""marry me"". Again, super suspicious. I asked him about it and he told me he didn't even remember it. It must be something his ex left there. Since we all have history I brushed that one off as well. 

After that I was the one always coming over to stay on base. He never visited me at home. When we weren't spending time with each other his responses were sparse. Sometimes I waited more than 48 hours. The upcoming off days he always wanted to spend with me never came and I was only able to see him on his terms when he told me he wanted to see me. I asked for clarification, I asked for reassurance, I asked him if he really wanted this. 

At this point in time I already stared the divorce process because he wanted me to get one. He told me he wanted to marry me, have a family with me etc. (Sidenote: I'm pretty embarrassed right now after typing this out. How could I be this blind - and spoiler - I still am.) We even stopped using protection since he wanted to have a baby with me.

Fast forward to the end of February when I took him to see my family for a weekend. We had an amazing time and things seemed to get better. 

But things got worse of course. Two weeks after the family trip he canceled on me for army reasons. I was already pretty sure I was pregnant at this point in time but hadn't taken a test yet and I didn't want to tell him without being sure. It was March 23th late at night when my messages weren't going through anymore. In the morning of March 24th I noticed he had blocked me. His last messages was something like ""I have so much to say to .. I love you"".

I consulted friends that reached out to him. He even blocked my husband who tried to contact him too. At one point a friend of mine got a response. Supposedly there was this accident in training out on the field etc. and he will contact me again the next day.

My husband has a friend who is stationed closely by and I already knew I was lied to and probably cheated on. Only being able to access a base with a sponsor meant I needed someone to help me get back all of my things to end this mess. 

The following Monday, March 25th, I picked up my helper and got all of my things. On my way there my ""boyfriend"" reached out to me, having unblocked me, telling me some wild cover story. 

I so wanted to let go but I couldn't. I even told him someone helped me and he then accused me of cheating on him etc. At this point I knew he was cheating but I didn't have any evidence. 

He didn't want to end things with me so we kept in contact. 

I took a pregnancy test on March 27th. It was positive. I wanted to be happy but I couldn't. I lost a child in the past and I knew if I'm ever going to be pregnant again I will be a mom. His reaction was ""omg"" and that we have to handle things. 

To keep the following things really short since diving in deeper hurts too much:

On the day of the abortion he told me he cheated on me this whole time. 

He never broke up with his ex, cheated on me/her the whole time. Lived a double life. Confessed to her at one point he ""got his ONS pregnant"" that now wants to bind him with a baby. She pressured him into pushing me into an abortion. To this day I don't really know what he wanted or if he simply lost touch with reality completely. I had the abortion on May 3rd after breaking the first one off a few days before and contemplating with my husband if we are going to raise this child. 

Of course his ex/gf reached out to me at one point. She had my contact info since he shared my personal medical information about the abortion with her. I gave him the information because he told me he needs it for the Army. He actually came to the clinic when I had the first appointment and he had to get off of work for that. So my dumb ass believed him.  
Throughout this whole time he treated me like shit. He was super nasty and I had to walk on eggshells to get anything out of him.

I ended up talking to his ex/gf for about two weeks. He told her he doesn't have any contact with me but he was still texting me most days. She wanted to work things out with him and I was just in some delusional state after just having had the abortion. I don't even know what I was thinking. When she needed someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on I was there for her - even doing every loyalty test she wanted me to do as in texting him things she told me to for her to see if he's still lying/cheating. And of course he was. This kept on going until this one night where I just had enough. She called me crying and he called me screaming and bitching at me. I blocked them both. 

I entered a month of peace and quiet. I didn't even know how suffocating all of this was until I ended it. 

Fast forward another month. I started getting random calls from random numbers. Picked up this one time and I heard his voice saying ""you blocked me"". 

And you probably all suspected it: I came back. Of course I did. I still had a few things at his place since I ended up going there again after the blocking incident happened. My main motivation was to get that stuff. I got on base this one day only for him to tell me that she - as in the ex/gf came and through all of my stuff out. But at least he gave me the money he owed me. I left, believing I'd never see him again. 

Boy was I wrong. It took about a week until he stood in front of my house crying. Telling me he'll die without me, that he broke things of with her finally and that I am the one he wanted to be with. That I can talk to any family member and his friends, that he is not lying anymore and so on. Let's call it lovebombing because this is what it was. He took me on a week long trip which was absolutely beautiful. Right after we even went to couples counseling for a few times. So things did in fact look promising. 

And guess who started the whole divorce process again? Right, I did. 

So fast forward to know. 

I cannot even put into words how traumatized I am from all of the above. I just covered the rough storyline but you can imagine that things were way worse than this all sounds like. 

I do believe he is not cheating currently but his commitment didn't stay the same. He is shitty when it comes to communication and sometimes it feels like I have to carry the whole relationship. We had so many talks and I always make myself believe that things will get better but they truly won't.

He didn't want to got to therapy anymore, he hasn't visited me at my place since July and his actions don't match his words.

So of course I asked him if and why he wants to have this relationship. 

He'll always tell me he cannot ever let me go and he loves me. 

My physical and mental health is so bad at this point. My anxiety is through the roof, I'm constantly sick. I don't know if I can trust his words and I always feel like I'm in love with potential.

But I am so deep in this. And now my second divorce date is coming up. And I truly don't know what to do. He is begging me not to end things and he always tells me he thinks he can do this. Everyone of his friends on base know me. All of them ask him when he'll ""pop the question"" and he always tells me how proud he is to be with such a beautiful and intelligent woman.

Again, please be kind. 

What do I do. And why does he even want to have this relationship.

Ever felt like your chair is trying to break up with you after a long day of work? It's time to learn 'how to sit ergonomically' and make your seat a comfortable, back-friendly companion. Let's dive into the world of ergonomics, where every bend and curve counts. So, grab your favorite snack, and let's get cozy with some spine-saving knowledge.
  
  
## The Anatomy of a Perfect Sit

Sitting may seem like the easiest thing in the world, but oh boy, if only our bodies could talk, right? They’d be shouting, “Help, we’re in a pickle!” The spine is a wonderfully intricate structure, designed with natural curves that, when respected, can turn any regular sitting session into a delightful experience. 

First off, let's break it down. Our spine has three main curves: the cervical (the neck), the thoracic (the upper back), and the lumbar (the lower back). Picture the spine like an elegant S-curve. When we sit, those curves should be maintained. If we hunch over like a sad turtle, we’re basically tossing our spine a curveball it didn’t ask for. And trust me, it won’t take that lying down!

So, what does the ideal sitting position look like? Think of it as an orchestra where every body part plays an essential role. Your feet should sit flat on the floor, firmly planted like a proud tree. Your knees should be at about hip level, creating a magical 90-degree angle. Now, keep that back straight—imagine there’s a string gently pulling your head up to the ceiling, aligning everything along the way. Your shoulders should be relaxed, like they just found out it’s Friday night! And don’t forget about your arms—rest them comfortably at your sides or on your desk, as if they were lounging at the beach. 

So, remember, each part of your body is in this together. Your spine is screaming for support, so give it the rightful place it deserves—honoring those curves while you sit like a winner!

## The Throne of Thrones: Choosing Your Warrior Chair

Finding the right chair can feel like hunting for buried treasure, but trust me, your back will thank you for the effort! My journey through the world of seating started when I, a proud warrior of productivity, decided to invest in my battle station. I’ve faced an array of chairs—some heroes, some absolute zeroes. There was one chair, a lovely faux-leather beast that looked super fancy but felt like sitting on a brick wall. Ouch! My back complained louder than a toddler denied dessert. 

An ergonomic chair does more than just look cool; it’s designed to befriend your spine. Picture this: adjustable armrests that don’t leave me feeling like I’m in a wrestling match with my desk, and lumbar support that cradles my lower back like a supportive hug from your favorite aunt. It’s also crucial that the seat depth is just right—too shallow, and I’m flying off like I’m in a rollercoaster; too deep, and I’m a sad pancake, struggling to breathe. 

A good chair should encourage you to maintain a healthy posture. If my chair has a headrest that whispers sweet nothings to my neck, I’m winning! Remember, while you may be chasing productivity, your tailbone deserves a cushy throne, not a subtle reminder that you’ve been planning your kingdom while neglecting your comfort. So gear up, and let your chair be your trusty steed!

## Feet First: The Forgotten Heroes of Sitting

When we think about sitting properly, we often overlook the unsung heroes of our posture—our feet. Yes, those little appendages at the end of our legs play a huge role in keeping us upright and comfortable. You might be thinking, “What do my feet have to do with my back pain?” Well, sit tight (pun intended) and let’s dive into this.

The way you position your feet can make all the difference. Ideally, your feet should be flat on the floor, with your knees bent at a right angle. This helps distribute your weight evenly and prevents your muscles from getting all knotted up. Picture this: sitting with your feet dangling like a kid on a swing, your body is in for a world of hurt. So, wiggle those toes, and let them do their job!

Here are a few tips:

* **Foot Positioning:** Keep your soles firmly planted; this provides a solid base.
* **Use a Footrest:** If your feet don’t touch the ground, a footrest can give them the support they deserve.
* **Stretch and Move:** Every so often, stand up and give those puppies a little shake. A little movement helps keep blood flowing.

Remember, happy feet equal a happy spine! So, give your feet a round of applause for helping you sit like a pro. You know they deserve it!

## The Desk Dilemma: Setting Up Your Workstation like a Pro

Setting up your workstation like a pro isn't just about aesthetics; it’s about saving your sanity and your spine. You ever get to a new job and feel like a game of Tetris when you try to adjust everything just right? I remember my first office gig. I sat down, plopped my elbows on the desk, and thought, ""What the heck is this?” The monitor was too high, the keyboard felt like it was doing the limbo, and I swear my chair was designed for a dollhouse.

To get your desk ready for ergonomic magic, start with your monitor. It should be at eye level—so you’re not constantly craning your neck like a confused giraffe. A simple rule I learned from a coworker is to sit up straight and have the top of the screen at or just below your eye level. If you’re looking down, you’re just inviting an angry spine to the party.

Next, your keyboard and mouse should be on the same level. Your elbows should be bent at about 90 degrees, like you’re trying to do a meditative yoga pose instead of a desk dive. Make sure to keep your wrists straight; floppy wrists are for jellyfish, not humans. And trust me, your tailbone will thank you; it definitely deserves more than just sitting on dignity like it’s an old trophy! 

So, while your coworkers might look like they’re lounging at a beach in their office chairs, you’ll be sitting like the ergonomic king or queen you were born to be.

## The Breakfast Club: Taking Regular Sitting Breaks

Sitting for long stretches can be a real killer for your productivity. Seriously, it’s like that friend who overstays their welcome at a party, drinking your soda, eating all your chips, and leaving you trapped in awkward conversations, except this friend is gravity and your chair. I learned the importance of taking regular breaks when I noticed that, about an hour into work, my brain felt like molasses—slow, sticky, and not really going anywhere.

At first, I tried the “just push through” method. News flash: it didn’t work. I began experimenting with different break routines. I found that taking a quick five-minute walk every hour worked wonders! I mean, even my cat, Mr. Whiskers, joined me sometimes, prancing around like he owned the place. Those little strolls gave my body a chance to stretch out, and guess what? My energy levels soared! I actually felt awake, as if someone had replaced my coffee with rocket fuel.

I also tried setting timers to remind myself to take breaks. Funny enough, hearing a cheerful ringtone got my mood up and made me dance in my chair. Let's be real: who doesn’t feel more energized after a little boogie? These breaks not only boosted my productivity but also brightened my day, turning work from a slog into a series of mini-celebrations. So, if you haven’t already, grab a snack, stretch, or even dance! Your body will thank you, and your tailbone will definitely give you a high-five.

## The Ergonomic Evolution: Small Changes for a Big Impact

You know, sometimes the smallest changes can create the biggest ripple effects. When it comes to sitting properly, every little adjustment counts, and trust me, I’ve learned this the hard way. I remember a time when I believed that slouching while binge-watching my favorite show was a true form of relaxation. Spoiler alert: my back didn’t agree! Over time, I discovered that ergonomic sitting isn’t just for those fancy office spaces—it can really change your life, one tiny tweak at a time.

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/how-to-sit-ergonomically> 

So, what does this look like in practice? First off, you don’t have to revamp your entire sitting setup overnight. Start by adjusting your chair height. It sounds trivial, but when your feet can comfortably touch the ground, it’s like your body is saying, “Thank you!” Aim for a relaxed position where your knees are at about hip level or slightly lower. Your lower back will thank you, I promise!

I’ve also found sticking a small cushion behind my lower back can do wonders. It’s like giving my spine a gentle hug. And while we’re at it, how about setting reminders to stand up every hour? It’s easier than you think; it turns into a mini dance break. Who doesn’t love a little groove while stretching those legs? So, what subtle shifts will you try today? Remember, making these little changes a habit is the real magic.

## Conclusions
  
  
So, there you have it, folks! The secret to a happy, healthy spine is not as complicated as we thought. It's all about choosing the right chair, setting up our workspace like a pro, and giving our body the breaks it deserves. Remember, every time you sit, you're making a choice - so choose wisely! Your back will thank you later. Now, go forth and conquer the ergonomic world, one perfectly positioned butt cheek at a time!",1,1735329709.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

#####Manually input coffee weight

https://reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1g4u5k4/option_for_brewing_according_to_weight_of_coffee/

Let us adjust either value. If I’m down to my last 21.7 grams of coffee let me enter that value and have the machine figure out how much water to use. We could press-and-hold the button to switch between water and coffee. Or…

##### Press-and-hold to go back

Multiple reviews have mentioned this. Here’s one: https://reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1fkr8mb/aiden_allow_metric_for_water_separate_from/

Add system-wide functionality to Press-and-hold the button to go back. Spinning the knob until I get the back option is super tedious. 

#####Mixed units of measure

https://reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1fkr8mb/aiden_allow_metric_for_water_separate_from/

I prefer measuring my water in ounces, coffee in grams, temperature in Fahrenheit, and elevation in feet. But, currently, the unit setting is global. Let us specify our preferred unit for each, please.

#####Grind size in brew profiles

https://reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1gxpr9p/aiden_grind_size_concept_idea/

I understand the machine has no control over this and the value varies between grinders. But would be great just for our own knowledge if we could enter the grind size in the brew profiles. 

I’d suggest three fields: 

1) generic settings like ultra-fine, fine, medium-fine, medium, medium-corse, corse, very corse. That way users with different grinders can approximate the grind size. 

2) Grinder used

3) Numeric grinder setting used",2,1735329554.0,FellowProducts,2,1.0,False

Here's the story. My mom had 12 or 13 hospital stays on and off until October of this year. The doctors gave her the choice of hospice or nursing home. She is only 59. She was given a year or less to live. She's had some improvement. She has Edema venous insufficiency. She takes water pills and potassium. She has blood clots but won't take her blood thinners. My dad is her caregiver. He is so tired. She's been getting up and around. She was using her walker. She hasn't been using it much recently. She gets up to use the bathroom. Then goes to the front door to take a couple of puffs of her cigarette. She also goes to her bedroom to lay down to take pressure off her tailbone. That's the only activity she gets. She was told she was a borderline diabetic 3 years ago. Her doctor wants her to lower her sodium and sugar intake. She hasn't done that. My dad told me she drinks 4 cups of the pre-made carton iced coffee a day. Plus 2 or 3 more cups of coffee with sugar and cream. She puts a bunch of salt on just about everything she eats. I've noticed she's been sleeping a lot more. My dad said she naps every single day.

We broke up at such a strange time in mine, that was full of change and transition. 

We both needed to find ourselves, I think. And we're making a lot of progress. 

But I had hope, even months ago, that someday you'd let me know when it was time to come back. When your life was on track. When you no longer met the diagnostic criteria, or at least when you felt confident in your interpersonal effectiveness. Even if it takes ten years. 

I think I knew, from the time we slow danced on the beach to that playlist I made for you, that this was going to be one for the ages. That our story would be long- I didn't expect the twists and turns that the last year had brought us, but I thought it'd be a long, long time before it was over. 

I want to try. 

I don't want to rush into anything. But I want to try. 

Maybe it won't work. Maybe we'll settle into a casual acquaintanceship, and just be names that don't make each other grimace when they come up in conversation. Maybe someday I'll visit your area independently (I promised to show my best friend that beautiful canyon we hiked, my first trip there) and we can get a coffee, or I'll invite you and the twins' parents for dinner while I'm in town. When you visit your parents, maybe we'll have brunch. Maybe we won't end up being in each other's lives on the way we thought - but maybe we will. 

I think it's important we don't put pressure on it. Give it some time, for us to get to know each other again. See if these grown up versions of us are still compatible. 

It isn't going to make sense to most people - that joke about our therapists throwing hands comes back to mind - but I don't think it has to. As long as it makes sense to us, in our wise minds. And mine is saying, that when you're okay, and when I'm okay, it isn't going to hurt anything to send some texts. Maybe make a call or two. Coffee, eventually. 

I want us to have strong, individual foundations, first. So the relationship we build, if we build one, it'll be strong too. [When the bones are good, the rest don't matter](https://youtu.be/Zmxfd3Z_wBA?si=quhfQ41Q6qf5UHJ3), right? ",1,1735329398.0,u_Camus_wept,0,0.99,False

Bartender that morning and I had a section plus the bar top. I come out with two trays and notice a couple has sat. I pass out everything on said trays and then go back behind the bar to greet the couple. I turn around one second to grab their coasters and straws to hand out with the greet and they stormed out. Ok...

Then, at night (serving) had a lady ask for decaf coffee. As much as I didn't want to make it, it's my job to. So I looked my hardest and couldn't find it. Offered her a regular instead and she said no. Ok, I give the table waters and bread and they're taking a bit to look (to the point that I have been sat again). I start serving the new table and the original ladies had decided what they wanted, but I was at the other table. So another server is talking to them and she gives the other server the order. The other server asks to take the table because she knows the ladies, so I say why not. I go on as normal serving my other two tables and they start giving me dirty looks and I notice that there is coffee on the table. Turns out my coworker found the decaf. Honestly genuinely happy for them for a second, glad they got what they wanted and felt bad for my honest mistake. They then flag me down, one of the ladies motions me in close to her, and then says ""Just so you know, I GOT my coffee!"" I kinda was caught off gaurd because it wasn't me refusing to give them service. It was a mistake. I just apologize and try to move on. She then ends the conversation with ""I just wanted you to know that. That's it."" And then they sat in my section for two hours....

Finally, *everyone* was using gift cards. Needing a manager swipe for every manual entry when they didn't work on the ziosk or DASH really did it for me. That and checking schedule to find I work the next seven days in a row with some days being doubles....

Bitcoin ATMs: the modern-day wizardry that combines the charm of traditional ATMs with the pizzazz of cryptocurrency. If you’ve ever stared at a Bitcoin ATM and wondered, “Is this thing a portal to a decentralized dimension?”—you’re not far off. And if you’ve used one, you’ve probably realized that QR codes are the unsung heroes of the whole operation. Enter our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App**: the perfect sidekick to your Bitcoin ATM adventures. Let’s dive into this fun crypto journey together, shall we?

# What Are Bitcoin ATMs?

Imagine an ATM that doesn’t spit out crumpled bills but instead sends you digital treasure straight to your crypto wallet. That’s a Bitcoin ATM! These machines allow users to buy (and sometimes sell) Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash or a linked bank account.

Bitcoin ATMs are the ultimate bridges between the physical and digital worlds. Whether you’re a seasoned hodler or a curious newbie, they make entering the crypto space as easy as withdrawing cash for your Friday night pizza.

# Why Are Bitcoin ATMs So Popular?

Bitcoin ATMs are growing faster than cats on the internet, and here’s why:

# 1. Accessibility

Not everyone is comfortable navigating complex exchanges. Bitcoin ATMs simplify the process—no need for lengthy account setups or understanding market jargon.

# 2. Speed

Want Bitcoin now? Bitcoin ATMs make it happen in minutes. No waiting for bank transfers or payment confirmations.

# 3. Privacy

Some Bitcoin ATMs allow for smaller transactions without requiring extensive personal information, giving users a layer of anonymity.

# 4. Global Reach

With thousands of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, finding one nearby is easier than finding a decent Wi-Fi connection in a coffee shop.

# The Role of QR Codes in Bitcoin ATMs

QR codes are the magic carpets of Bitcoin ATMs. They transport your wallet address from your phone to the ATM without a hitch. Here’s how they work:

1. **Wallet Address**: When you use a Bitcoin ATM, you’ll need to scan your wallet’s QR code to receive your cryptocurrency.
2. **Transaction Confirmation**: QR codes eliminate errors. No one wants to type out a 34-character Bitcoin address manually.
3. **Speed and Convenience**: It’s as simple as point, scan, and presto—your crypto is on its way!

Without QR codes, Bitcoin ATMs would be like trying to text on a flip phone—technically possible, but incredibly frustrating.

She recently changed her appointments from 8 or 830 am to 130PM. 

I'm free on the day she has her appt so used to sleep in a bit and she'd go get her morning coffee and talk. 

Now in the afternoons she started asking me to leave the apartment. Ive questioned the necessity at first since she knows I can't hear a thing with my noise cancelling headphones in. She jumpscares me constantly when I am wearing them so she knows I can't hear and she knows I'm not a snoopy person. I don't wanna know what she is talking about. 

The last 2 weeks she asked me hours ahead of time if I could run out for some errands or something and I ofc agreed. 

Today we went back to sleep together and woke up very close to her appt. I have IBS and usually need urgent access to a bathroom for an hour or so after waking. 

She never asked me to leave today and a few minutes before her call i put my headphones on and wished her luck. She claims she saw my wallet in hand (just moving it? Getting some cash ready I need later) and assumed I was leaving. 

I spent most of her appt taking out the trash/recycling from the last few days and in the bathroom. 

When she came out of the bedroom ( closed door, never popped her head out to ask me if I was leaving etc) she was upset that I hadn't left. 

I explained myself but she concluded that I think she is being ridiculous and can't do this for her since I do not understand it. 

I admit I emphasize how I can't hear a single sound with these headphones on a bit much probably bc it does confuse me but I've never said she was being ridiculous or commented at all. I just told her you didn't ask me today.

1hnn9nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hnn9nt/illusions/,Illusions.,"Dear Richard (not your name),

During a discussion on ghosts, a friend told me something along the lines of, ""If I don't acknowledge them, they won't acknowledge me.""  I don't know about ghosts, but you could say I know what that's like.  At this time of year, I seem unable to keep the ouija board off my lap.  What is it about December?  With the trees bare and the bank sparse and beige, I stare at my reflection in the creek and I see what I have lost.  The solemn sea oats nod at my back.  The scent of pinewood burning in a distant fireplace twists its way to my nose, dredging the memory of my tear-streaked face buried in your smoky work jacket.

Remember the butt-ends of our days back then?  At the most, we had ten minutes.  I don't even recall how it began, it just did.  I would stand at the sink, sleeves rolled, washing my coffee cup.  You would steal in and close the door behind you.  From the inner pocket of your worn navy coat, you'd extract a page folded to oblivion and, hands trembling, read me one of your poems.  

Poetry was one of many odd commonalities between us, a seemingly incongruous duo.  Your style was very unlike mine, but I loved that you wrote.  Moreover, I was honored that you chose to share your work with me.  Those few minutes were a shared cup of kinship, warming us before we turned up our collars and trudged into the gloomy pall of those fast-fading evenings.  Looking back, that was all metaphor, wasn't it?  

There was a bizarre intimacy between us that I've never known before.  It was a rare bird fated to extinction.  I felt it the very first time I saw you.  I would bet anything you felt it, too.  But that room was built on limestone karst.  If we didn’t tread lightly, not only would we send ourselves plummeting into chaos, but everything and everyone around us, too.  I worried at times that you shouldered more gravity.  That you would crack the mantle.  Disturb the universe.  I shouldn’t have been.  We were both delicate as foxes on a frozen pond.

A dyed-in-the-wool doubting Thomas, I once rolled my mind's eye at your parting declaration that we had a ""soul connection.""  But when I'm here, feeling your fabric woven into the quilt of my existence, I wade into the mystic.  It shocks me like frigid water.  How can I feel something's true when I disavow the premise?  It shocks me that I know what you meant.  It shocks me that I feel I've known you.  I feel it like I feel my fingers gripping my pen, my heart beating beneath my ribcage.  I feel it in the core of my self.  Is this what religious people experience?  Is this belief?  You felt it.  That's why you gave me the book. 

It's fortunate that I do not suffer the full agony of your loss unless I plumb the depths.  Well, I am not smart.  I dove in today.  I flipped back to a poem I wrote in your style.  I still couldn't finish it.  Tears muddled the words on the page.  I wept.  It tore through me from the bottomless spring of grief, chilled from permafrost, telling me again what I already know: I was not meant to be yours, nor you mine.  Not in this life.  You know that.  I know that.  And though I mourn your absence and what could not be, I remain grateful that I crossed paths with you -- again.  Somehow.  

I miss you.  You already know.

Some things I would like to see. 

1) please denote exactly what coffee maker you have. A Keurig or a drip coffee maker - then if it’s a drip coffee, please note what filter it takes. If I am driving/shopping on the way in, I can be prepared (cone, basket etc)

2) well stocked kitchen. That actually will need a little more definition. Is there a crockpot, pressure cooker, cookie sheets, food processor. Please list all the majors.

3) I understand that people are jerks and you will not have top of the line everything. No problem. However, the dollar store can opener that takes you 5 minutes to open a can of soup can be easily remedied.   A handful of spatulas and large mixing bowls that cost less than $20 for everything is wonderful to have. I have had to use the blender container just for mixing something due to lack of a proper size bowl.

I always make it work, but when you’re spending a decent amount of money you hope for the bare minimum. As a frequent guest, I look at these things like it should be basic information and if someone takes the time to do that, I know they are a host I would like to stay with. Details matter.

Since the MIP award began in 1986, I thought I’d go and apply some wins retroactively.

**Reason:**

If the NBA handed out a Most Improved Player award in 1966, Happy Hairston would’ve strolled to the podium with the confidence of a man who knew he’d just proven everyone wrong. Drafted in the fourth round and 35th overall—a draft position so low you’d think he was selected as an afterthought during a coffee break—Hairston’s rookie season was more “meh” than “wow.” Six points a game, five rebounds, and 37% shooting made him look like the guy you’d send in to give your starters a breather—not the one you’d rely on to carry any serious weight. But by 1966, Happy was anything but an afterthought.

Hairston flipped the narrative in his sophomore season with the Cincinnati Royals. He bumped his scoring average to 14.1 points per game, hauled in 7.6 rebounds, and shot a slick 48.9% from the floor—like someone who finally figured out where the basket was hiding. His physicality at the power forward position made him a tough customer in the paint, while his surprising agility left defenders scratching their heads. He wasn’t just cleaning up around the rim—he was redecorating the place.

The Royals reaped the benefits. Adding Hairston to their rotation was like upgrading from a reliable sedan to a muscle car. Poor Wayne Embry—an All-Star the previous year—found himself getting benched in favor of the new guy. And sure, the Royals didn’t go all the way (thanks, Celtics), but Happy wasn’t the problem. He ranked fifth in field goal percentage, 16th in PER, and 16th in win shares per 48 minutes—a top-tier performance for someone who’d just been figuring things out a year earlier.

Happy Hairston wasn’t just a flash-in-the-pan sophomore; his 1966 breakout set the tone for a quietly outstanding career. Over the next decade, he became one of the most reliable double-double machines in the league. In three separate seasons, he averaged over 18 points and 10 rebounds—a feat that placed him among the elite forwards of his time, even if the All-Star voters consistently looked the other way. By the time he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, Hairston had developed into a key contributor on one of the most iconic teams in NBA history.

In the 1972 season, Happy’s hustle and physicality were instrumental in the Lakers’ record-setting 33-game win streak and their eventual NBA championship. That playoff run was his career apex, solidifying him as more than just a solid starter—he was a winner. Hairston’s game, a mix of brute force and sneaky finesse, proved timeless, earning him respect as one of the most underappreciated players of his era. If 1966 showed what Happy Hairston could do, the rest of his career showed just how much he was willing to give.

Over the past couple of months i've been working on my own side projects to do with the tube and creating apps to track their timetables. I ran into a problem very early on in that TFL itself doesn't have up to date lists of every station, the lines they serve along with their current location. The best attempt at finding this data resulted in me finding a 2019 csv file which was given in response to a foi request. This file wasn't complete and missed many of the stations along with not having an accurate location of the station. Many times the station entrance given by TFL was 2-3 streets away.

So i started a new side project to map each of the 455 stations across the tube, overground, Elizabeth line and tram. This took quite a while as you can imagine and at one point i had to start from scratch when the new overground line names were brought in. However, after many nights clicking through the TFL website and google maps i managed to finish the complete list.

I wanted to share it with you all because i think there is good ideas out there and people could use this as a basis for their own projects.

Now comes the serious bit. The only downside of sharing this via the internet is that the second the file gets uploaded it would get web scrapped or sucked in by some sort of AI learning algorithm. I don't think thats really fair after the 2 months of effort i put into this so ive instead made the file available for a small donation via buy me a coffee for the sum of £3.60 (the price of a meal deal with a clubcard).

Key Features to Consider When Designing a Modular Outdoor Kitchen
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a modular outdoor kitchen takes careful consideration to ensure it meets your needs and enhances your outdoor space. Here are key features to consider as you embark on creating the perfect outdoor cooking area.

### Layout and Space Planning

Before you jump into specifics, it’s essential to assess your outdoor space. A well-designed layout flows intuitively and allows for efficient movement. Consider the following:

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/modular-outdoor-kitchens  
  
- **Work Triangle:** Create a natural flow by spacing the grill, sink, and refrigerator in a triangular formation. This design minimizes unnecessary steps while cooking.
- **Entertainment Areas:** Think about how you will entertain guests. Incorporate seating areas where people can relax while you cook.
- **Sun and Shade:** Position your kitchen’s main features to balance sun and shade. You may want areas that are sunny for morning coffee and shaded spots for afternoon barbecues.

### Materials and Durability

Outdoor kitchens are exposed to the elements. Selecting durable materials will ensure longevity and easy maintenance. Here are some materials to consider:

- **Stainless Steel:** Ideal for appliances and fixtures, stainless steel resists rust and stains while providing a modern look.
- **Stone or Concrete Countertops:** These materials are not only visually appealing but also withstand weather conditions exceptionally well.
- **Weather-Resistant Cabinets:** Invest in cabinets made from high-density polyethylene or marine-grade polymer to ensure they last.

### Appliances and Equipment

Your outdoor kitchen should be equipped with appliances that meet your cooking style and entertaining needs. Below are essential appliances to include:

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/modular-outdoor-kitchens  
  
- **Grill:** The heart of every outdoor kitchen. Choose between gas, charcoal, or electric based on your preferences.

- **Sink:** A sink with running water makes cleanup a breeze. Look for models designed for outdoor settings.
- **Pizza Oven:** A fun addition for those who love culinary experimentation.

### Storage Solutions

Proper storage is crucial in any kitchen, especially for outdoor use. Plan for adequate storage options to keep everything organized:

- **Cabinets:** Waterproof cabinets can hold utensils, grill tools, and dishware out of sight.
- **Pantry Space:** Consider shelving to store spices, oils, and other cooking essentials.
- **Under-Counter Storage:** Make use of every inch available by utilizing the space under counters.

### Personalization and Style

Your outdoor kitchen should reflect your style. Choosing a theme can help tie the space together:

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/modular-outdoor-kitchens  
  
- **Color Schemes:** Select colors that complement your home and landscaping.
- **Lighting:** Install ambient and task lighting for evening gatherings and safer cooking.
- **Accessories:** Adding personal touches like artwork or plants can make the space feel inviting.

### Utility and Functionality

Consider the utility of your outdoor kitchen:

- **Electricity and Gas Lines:** Ensure you have proper utilities to support your appliances, including ample outlets.
- **Water Access:** Having running water is a huge benefit for cooking and cleaning.
- **Ventilation:** If you're using a grill, consider installing a vent hood to control smoke and odors.

By focusing on these key features, you can create a modular outdoor kitchen that perfectly suits your lifestyle and enhances your outdoor dining experience. Whether you're entertaining guests or enjoying quiet family dinners, thoughtful design will contribute significantly to the enjoyment of your space.

### Conclusion

I've been thinking about it lately and thought I'd share. I didn't think of it as sugaring then, but in retrospect it was clearly the start. 

My (now ex) wife was having a child, and it fell upon me to find some au pair candidates, with my wife having the final say. Now, there were other problems in our marriage, but I don't claim any excuses. As I started meeting these young women, I found myself favoring some more than others for reasons beyond just their qualifications. Naturally, I was interested in the hottest ones. 

And one in particular was an absolute stunner, an aspiring model from the Ukraine (who, fortunately, had grown up caring for 4 younger siblings). We met for coffee and spoke at length, and while everything was kept above-board, there was an immediate attraction and ""understanding"" for lack of a better word. At that point I had not even admitted to myself what I was looking for, but she saw it very clearly.

I made sure she understood my wife's needs and concerns and how to best address them in a final interview. I also hinted that she should ""dress down"" and, well, not look as good as she really does. (I don't think I actually needed to say that.)

Well, she aced the interview, and became our very able au pair. Under the table, I helped her out with other expenses, and was even able to put her in touch with the right people to get a leg up on her modeling career. (She went on to become a full-time model.)

And, of course, by the end of the first week we were having sex. First only occasionally, but she was (very) enthusiastic and satisfied me in ways my wife never had, and I was hooked. So I took advantage of more opportunities until it was a part of the daily schedule—albeit one my wife was not aware of. 

Am I proud of it? Of course not. Was it in any way a smart place to find extracurricular sex? Hell, no. I'm lucky I made it out without the situation blowing up in one way or another.

But I did enjoy the hell out of it, and it was the first thing in years I had done ""for myself"" which ended up triggering a number of ultimately healthy changes, including understanding that a monogamous lifestyle was not for me, and that I didn't need to cheat in order to have that.

Anyway, judge all of that how you will—life is messy—but it's for my part its nice to find a forum where I can share it.",1,1735328702.0,sugarlifestyleforum,2,0.57,False

I’m travelling from the Netherlands to Bangalore next month \[2nd week of Jan\] and I can bring back some specialty coffee beans. I can offer 4 people 250 grams each \[1 kg in total\].

Here’s how it’ll work:

* The cost will need to be paid upfront before I purchase the coffee here in NL. \[Can be transferred to an Indian number via UPI\]
* Once I’m in Bangalore, I’ll send it to you via Dunzo/Swiggy Genie/any other service of your choice \[I live near Whitefield, so ideally a 10km radius from there would be easier to deliver to\].

I live in Amsterdam so if you were to buy from an Amsterdam roaster (Friedhats, DAK, Rumbaba, Five Ways, etc), I may be able to pick it up directly from the store and could potentially avoid shipping costs too! 

Other Dutch roasters outside Amsterdam would be Manhattan Roasters, Single Estate Coffee, Giraffe Coffee and Keen.

If you’re interested DM me with your preferred choice and I will send you further details!

Okay, I need some perspective because my family is making me feel like a total Scrooge here.  

Last Christmas, my sister, *Anna*, went all out and got me this fancy gift—a new gaming chair. It was awesome, sure, but it caught me completely off guard because we had ALL agreed as a family to do a Secret Santa with a $30 limit. I had drawn my cousin's name and followed the rules, getting him a nice $30 whiskey set.  

When I opened Anna’s gift, I was shocked but also kind of uncomfortable. She brushed it off like, ""Oh, I just thought you'd really love it, and I had extra cash this year!"" I said thank you, of course, but I also reminded her about the whole Secret Santa agreement. She just laughed and said it was no big deal.  

Fast forward to this year. I stuck to the same Secret Santa rules (again, $30 limit). I drew my dad this time and got him a great coffee subscription box. Everyone exchanged their gifts, and then Anna looked at me expectantly. When I didn’t pull out a special gift for her, she looked kind of hurt but didn’t say anything at the time.  

Later, she cornered me in the kitchen and asked why I didn’t get her ""something extra."" I told her that I didn’t realize we were doing personal gifts outside of the Secret Santa this year, and last year was kind of a one-off surprise. She said that since she went out of her way for me last year, she thought I’d do the same for her this year, ""to even things out.""  

I told her I appreciated her generosity last year but didn’t feel obligated to start a gift-giving precedent outside of our agreed Secret Santa. She called me selfish and stormed off. Now my mom and a couple of other family members are saying I should’ve gotten her *something*, even if it was small, as a thank-you for last year.  

I genuinely didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, but I also feel like sticking to the agreed rules shouldn’t make me the bad guy. AITAH for not getting her a gift this year?

is worth considering if paying it off ahead of schedule is the best use of  
your capital.

In today’s environment, here’s my rough guideline:

  
If your interest rate is...  
Less than 3%, pay it off slowly and route the money to your  
investments instead.

Between 3-5%, do whatever feels most comfortable: Either put  
the money to debt payment or investments.  
More than 5%, pay it off ASAP.

  
But this is just looking at the numbers. 

There is a lot to be said for focusing on just getting it out of your life and moving on. Especially if keeping your debt under control has been a problem for you.

  
**OK, I’m gonna pay it off! What now?**

  
Countless articles and books have been written about ridding yourself of  
debt. If after reading this chapter you feel you need more guidance and  
help, by all means embrace them. 

But be careful not to let the pursuit of the methods get in the way of the doing. 

The truth is, there is no easy way. But it is pretty simple.

  
Here’s what I’d do:

  
\--> Make a list of all your debts.  
\--> Eliminate all non-essential spending, **and I mean all of it**. 

\--> Thoseroutine $5 coffees, $20 dinners and $12 cocktails add up.

\--> This is what will free up the money you need to pour on the debt flames that are burning up your life. 

\--> The more you pour, the sooner you stop burning.  
\--> Rank your debts by interest rate.  
\--> Pay the minimum required on all your debts and then focus the rest of your available money on the one with the highest interest rate first.

  
Once you’ve blown that one away, move on to the second highest  
and right on down the list.

  
Once you’re done, send me a note and let me know. I’ll be raising  
my glass in a kudos salute to you!

1hnmmbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1hnmmbr/my_advice_for_fixing_microbiome_is_to_address_all/,My advice for fixing microbiome is to address all inflammations sources at the same time,"In 2022 I've started to feel sick after drinking soda or eating anything with sugar. Also started to have bad sleep and there were tremors after coffee intake. Meat was harder to process by my gut. Shortly I had gastritis and stuck with it for more than 1 year. Tried everything, EDS confirmed it but nothing worked to remove it. I can honestly say that stress was a factor but not the main one. All doctors told me to take PPI medication and I'm now sure this did me more harm than good. Made a lot of tests for all kind of conditions, viruses, bacteria, CT scans, all good. Just some IPE which I think it was a temporary issue due to stress and inflammation (fixed after retest), low D vitamin, high B6, low DAO activity and now the latest is almost no lysine in my blood (< 6 μmol/L where normal is 105-335).

After ending the PPI treatment I was even more affected because I've started to develop neurological issues, wasn't able to focus anymore, could not sleep at all. It was terrible. It was not fear alone, it was inflammation that wrecked everything. I think PPI did terrible things to my microbiome. Gastritis was fixed later with nigella sativa oil (only 3-4 pills). Couldn't take more because there was a huge spike in stress and anxiety after taking it. I think it was either die-off either more microbiome unbalance. But it certainly helped since I could eat anything since taking it. However there was a new problem. Huge anxiety started to developed with higher highs and lower lows in comparison with how stressed I was from gastritis. Psychiatrist meds helped but I've always felt they just make me more stress resistance but didn't fix the root cause. With them I was just sedated but still hyperactive.

Solution to this anxiety was NAG which I think it worked because it's fixing leaky gut. It helps with other types of inflammation like brainstem inflammation. Since I took the first pill I knew this is something good for real. Since NAG is amino acid I knew the solution could be from amino acids. Did blood amino acid tests and found - in the lower end - all amino acids in charge with neuroprotection which happen to also help with cartilages and arthritis. Now I'm taking all those missing amino acids. Best results are with NAG, l-carnitine (lysine is precursor), l-threonine (intestinal repair), nicotinamide riboside (same as l-carnitine it provides cellular energy).

There is definitely a great progress and now I'm sure my microbiome was the issue all the time. There are evidences that pandemy had impact on the microbiome after the virus was eliminated from our bodies. My microbiome indicated lack of neuroactive bacteria, too high klebsiella prevotella ruminococcus faecalibacterium. I do feel more energy now, lower and lower brain fog, lower brainstem inflammation, lower toxins in my blood, no more anxiety. But this was achieved with addressing all problems at the same time:  
\- take something to kill pathogenic bacteria (oregano oil, garlic extract, berberine, nigella sativa oil)  
\- add good bacteria (eat kefir, oat, probiotics)  
\- fix leaky gut (nag, l-threonine, zinc l-carnosine, type 2 collagen)  
\- fix nervous system cells (alpha-lipoic acid, nag, l-carnitine)  
\- maximize digestion process (add something for better digestion)  
\- eliminate stress (relaxation techniques, sport, music)  
\- prevent stress (adaptogens, nicotinamide riboside, phosphatidylserine, phenylalanine, NAC+glycine)  
\- eliminate blood toxins (teas like irish moss, viola tricolor, NAC, omega-3)  
\- eliminate heavy metals (chlorella, cinnamon, birch tree - Betula)  
\- add energy directly to cells (l-carnitine, NAD+ or nicotinamide riboside)  
\- eat temporarily a gut friendly diet (lot of kefir, oat, no sugar, no alcohol, easy meat, lot of prebiotics, no carbs)

Without addressing all these issues at once there will be low or no progress since the inflammation is everywhere in the body. If microbiome is sick everything will be out of control. All these must be addressed at once otherwise inflammation will still be somewhere and since everything is interconnected if one organ/system is still inflamed while trying a treatment then the brain will remain inflamed and gut-brain axis remains inflamed. Check for other inflammation sources (for example low back pain) and fix them too. Supplements are important but what we eat is even more important because supplements are fastly absorbed and in my case they have a maximum of 1h in effect whereas food is the main source of energy and stays in our system longer. If there is something we can do about it is to use the food as the main healing agent. This means food must be digestion agent, healing agent, anti-inflammatory, probiotic and more.",3,1735327354.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

I had to convince him otherwise. He hasn’t recorded anything in decades though he is a local gigging musician. 

We recorded 15 tracks at my home studio. Though I’ve demoed his songs to people and the adjectives I get back are lush rich and vibrant apparently he didn’t like them. He wants to record at his house which is about a mile from me. He likes the sound there better and he has some outboard gear we can use plus all of his instruments amps etc. 

He tells me he was an assistant at a studio at one time. I feel on the one hand that I am learning and will continue to learn from him.

“Morning.”

“Morning.” Aurora says without looking up.

“Look, I’m making breakfast soon. If I don’t see you up there. I’m slapping another twenty four hour ban on you.”

“How does no one know this? What cities?”

“Are you out of your fucking mind?” Aurora asks,

“Maybe. If a shadowy government agent can’t crack the drives and find the kids. Who can?”

“Yeah. No. I dunno. Now what?”

“Continue as we were. We can’t stop a nuke.”

Aurora sighs and looks off into the distance.

“How are things going down here?” I ask.          

“Fairly well. I’ve read every thing about earth magic in these grimores.”

“So, is there any other magic in the books?”

“Yeah. There’s a fair amount of necromancy. I really haven’t dived too much into that.”

“Why not?” I ask.

“Necromancy is the foulest of magic. As far as I’m concerned, it’s blasphemy. Fucking vile shit.”

“I mean…it could be helpful. Raising a zombie to help out.”

Aurora looks at me with an angry stare.
“That’s not funny.”

I raise my hands.
“Ok, fine. I didn’t know. Come on, let’s get some breakfast.”

I am surprised that Aurora didn’t fight me. We go upstairs and I begin cooking. Aurora makes the coffee and goes out to the patio and smokes a cigarette. Soon I’ll join her. I make everyone something to eat. All the gremlins rush into the kitchen and I have to yell.
“Not that plate. That’s Aurora’s.”

They nod and scarf down their food. I grab Aurora’s plate and my iced coffee and head outside. I place the plate down and sit and light my blunt.
“Here you go.”

“Ok. Thanks.” She says as she looks up.

I look up.
“What are you looking at?”

“I have an idea. Just need to figure out the right words.”

“Are you making a spell? For what?” I ask before taking a hit.

“More of an experiment.”

“How do spells work? Just finding the right words?” I ask.

“The words almost don’t matter.” Aurora answers.

“Wait? What? Explain.”

“The words are expressions of intent or will. The words channel the will. Eventually I won’t even need words. My will or intent will do.”

“No shit.” I say before taking another hit.

“Ok. I think I’m ready.” Aurora says.

I listen to her mumble. I pick up the occasional word but that’s about it. Aurora blinks and says.
“Not quite right…hum.”

She mumbles a few more words and gasps.
“There it is.”

I look up again.
“What?”

“That agent wasn’t bullshitting.”

“About what? What the fuck are you talking about?” I ask.

“You were right.” She says.

“You’re pissing me off.” I reply.

“They do watch by satellite.”

“The fuck out of here. You telling me you can see a satellite in orbit? What a bunch of horseshit.” I say before taking a sip.

“I can see them all. The rest are slightly moving but that one is staying in a fixed position.”

“This is outrageous bullshit.”

Aurora cuts me off.
“I can see space and the stars.”

“Bitch. The weed has fried your brain. I may have to cut you off of that too from time to time.”

“I wonder….” Aurora says as she looks down to the ground. Then she says. “Doesn’t work. Will have to adjust the spell.”

I slap my forehead and close my eyes.
“I don’t believe this.”

“I can prove it.” Aurora tells me.

“I want to see you try.”

Aurora whistles and Scorn flies to the table. Then she looks at me.
“Go into notes and write a word. Any word.”

I pull out my phone and keep it close to me as I type.
“Done. Even did it in the biggest font to help you out.” I sarcastically say.

“Now give your phone to Scorn. Scorn, fly as fast and as far as you can. When you can’t see us. Turn around and point the phone this way and show it to me.”

Before I can do anything. Scorn takes my phone and flies off at a crazy speed. Aurora lowers her head.

“Good showmanship. Smart.” I say.

When Scorn disappears out of view. Aurora mumbles again and opens her eyes.

“Well?” I ask.

“Phone went into sleep mode. He’s turning it back on.” She says.

“Yeah…right.”

“Apple.” Aurora says.

“How the fuck did you know that?” I yell.

“I don’t. I can see the word apple.”

“How? What? Huh.” I really don’t know what to say.

Scorn returns and drops my phone onto my lap and then he lands on Aurora’s shoulder.

“If you’ll excuse me. I’m taking a shower.” Aurora says as she gets up.

“Yeah, ok.”

Aurora leaves and I’m alone. I look up to the sky and whisper.
“No way…”

I finish my blunt and coffee. I’m not alone for along before Maddy walks out and joins me.
“Got something for you.”

“Wait. How you feeling? What’s going to happen to the election?”

“Well. The mayor is still on the ballot but he said he won’t accept the results if he wins.”

“Whats that mean? So are you a shoe in?”

“Looks like it. I don’t want to win like this.”

“I get that. Still, the right person is going to be mayor.”

“I appreciate you saying that. In light of recent events. The advisors have now come together and vowed to help me anyway they can.”

“Cool. At least they put their differences aside for you.”

Maddy gives me a small smile,
“It is nice. Are you ready to hear what I got for you?”

Now I smile as I fold my arms and lean back.
“I’m all ears.”

“There’s a town in trouble.”

“What’s it called?”

“Springville.”

“I think I’ve heard of it. What’s going on?” I ask.

“Strange happenings. It’s hard to explain. It seems the town is suffering from mass hallucinations.”

“What kind?” I ask.

“What you got? They are seeing anything and everything.”

“Shit. Any idea what’s causing it?” I ask.

“No. It just started a few days ago.”

I let out a sigh.
“Well. Ok. All hands on deck, I guess. Aurora is taking a shower. I’ll let her know what’s go8ng on when she gets out.”

“I’ll call Holden. I passed him on the way in.”

“Ok. Sounds like a plan.”

Maddy pats my arm and leaves. I take the last sip of my coffee and I head inside and straight to the bathroom I know Aurora s song. I knock on the door.
“Yeah. Come in.”

I open the door and find Aurora taking a bubble bath and playing with Scorn who is in the side of the tub.
“Got a job. We will be rolling out in ten minutes.”

Aurora tilts her head back.
“Damn it. I voluntarily freshen up and now this.”

“Hey…that’s the job.”

“Fine. I’ll be down in a minute.”

“Cool.” I say before shutting the door.

I strap on my hatchet and head towards the office. Maddy of course is in there typing away on the computer.

“Get ahold of Holden?” I ask.

“Yup. Sent him the details. He’ll meet you there.”

“Excellent. Aurora will be down in a minute.”

Maddy looks up.
“Hey, be careful. This feels sketchy.”

“What job doesn’t feel sketchy?” I ask.

Maddy looks at me for a moment before saying.
“Fair enough.”

I look back and call out.
“Gor!”

The rock gremlin runs in the office. I lean over and put my hands on my knees.
“Hey, man. Want to go on a job with me? I could probably use the muscle.”

Gor grumbles.

“Cool. We are leaving in a minute.” I say as I look up and see Snowflake. “You want to come too?”

Snowflake gives me a dismissive wave before walking away chattering.

“That’s a lie. You ain’t busy. You don’t have any hair to wash.”

I shake my head as Aurora walks down the stairs. She has decided to go full goth and she is wearing a long, lacey black dress.

“You do know we aren’t going on a date right?” I ask.

“Just a precaution. Gia sees fit to send me a handsome man almost everyday.”

“Uh huh. Sure. Let’s go.”

“Let’s.” Aurora says as Scorn flies and lands on her shoulder. For the record, Scorn and Gor seem pleased they are going with us. We get into Jolene and after a hours drive, we make it to Springville. Just inside the city limits is an ice cream shop. We pull into the park lot and park.

“Why we stopping here?” Aurora asks.

“This is where we are meeting Holden.”

“Then where is he?”

“He’ll be here. Outlaws don’t like being on time it seems. Fuck it. Let’s get some ice cream while we wait.” I say.

We do exactly that. Due to his size, Scorn didn’t get a cone but a pup cup. He sits next to Gor who is eating his own cone.”

“This was a good idea.” Aurora says.

“Large twist cone is my mom’s and uncle Helsing’s favorite.” I say before taking a lick.

After about five minutes Holden shows up with some members of his chapter. Rabies and Grave. Rabies was skinny and tweaked out looking. With his unruly long hair and beard. Grave I’ve meet before. Her silence kinda unnerves me.

“Brought some help. They wanted some fresh air.” Holden says as he gets off his bike.

“Just as long as they know I’m calling the shots.” I reply.

“No problem. Glad to go on a run. Hey fellas.” Rabies says as he walks over to Scorn and Gor and sits down. Grave says nothing. She just stands there as the wind blows her hair over her face.

“Ok. Let’s go. Maddy says the mayor is at the park. It’s not far from here.” I say.

“Lead the way.” Holden tells me.

Holden and his members follow me as I drive Jolene. We reach the park and I see a man wearing khakis and a black polo. I get out and walk towards him,
“Mayor?” I ask.

“Yes. Are you Illyria from the network?”

“I am.” I answer as I shake his hand.

“So what’s going on?” I ask.

The mayor sighs as he runs a hand through his hair.
“Hard to explain. We’ve never seen anything like it. We have a couple of supernatural, occult experts and they are baffled. You just have to see it yourself.”

“Ok, mayor. Let me and my crew see what’s going on. Where do we go?”

The mayor points to a line of trees.
“Just past those trees.”

“Alright. Once we figure this out. I’ll come and find you.”

“That’s fine. I hope you come to me with good news.”

I walk over to where everybody is.
“What’s going on is past those trees.”

“Let’s go.” Holden says as he starts walking.

Aurora looks strange.

“You good?” I ask.

“Yeah. This place feels weird. Kinda tingly.”

“Let me know if you feel worse or something.”

“I will.”

I lead everyone to the trees. Right before we pass them. Holden and the rest of the werewolves stop.
“What’s wrong?” I ask.

“This place smells funny.” Rabies says.

“Like ozone but wrong.” Holden adds.

“Ok. If it gets worse. Tell me.” I tell them.

They nod and we continue. We get to the trees and the field looks normal.
“Let’s see what we can find.” I say.

We walk pass the trees and the world changes. The world goes to day to night slowly and back again. The world also shines with different colors. Streaking across the sky is little shooting stars of different colors.

“What the fuck is this?” Holden asks.

“Well. We found the problem. Have no idea what the problem is however.” I reply.

“Do you hear it?” Aurora asks.

“Hear what?” I ask.

“The music. It’s beautiful.”

“No. You’re the only one that hears it.” I reply.

“This place is where ley lines cross. Very rare.”

“What’s a ley line?” Rabies asks.

Aurora tilts her head as she answers.
“Basically currents of energy that cover the whole world. Something has caused a block at this intersection. If the blockage is removed. Things should go back to normal.”

“Yeah…but….how do we remove the blockage?” I ask.

“We don’t. I do. I’m an earth witch and it’s my responsibility.” Aurora says with a far away look in her eyes.

“Ok. Let’s not do anything rash. Let’s think about this.” I say.

Aurora gently removes Scorn from her shoulder.
“Stay little one. You are not strong enough and may get hurt.”

She places him next to Gor. I don’t like this. Aurora is acting very odd.

“Aurora. Let’s think this over.” I say.

“There’s nothing to think about. Now is the time for action before things get worse.”

Aurora starts walking.

“We need to stop her.” I say.

“On it.” Rabies says before jogging towards Aurora. He doesn’t even get close. Without looking, Aurora casts a hand backwards and Rabies is knocked off his feet and back towards us.

“Leave her. She obviously knows what she is doing.” Holden says. As he helps Rabies up he asks.
“You good dude?”

Rabies looks around with wide eyes.
“Yeah. I’m good.”

We can only stand and watch Aurora do he thing. As she walks, she starts to sway from side to side. For whatever reason, she stops walking and just sways back and forth.

“Hey, man. What is she doing?” Rabies asks.

“I don’t know, dude.” Holden answers.

Aurora starts moving her arms slowly as she sways.

“I…I think she is standing at the exact spot where the lines intersect.” I observe.

Aurora’s movements become bigger and faster.

This is when shit gets wild.

Clouds start moving and changing. Th change between day and night speeds up. Then it slows down. The little shooting starts start flying around in an organized manner. Well, at least we can tell if they are flying in a pattern now. The sun starts to shine as snow falls in a flurry. This happens as the wind picks up. Gor grumbles.
“I don’t know, dude. We have to trust her.”

The sky changes again to a cloudless sky but with torrential rain.

“I think I know what she is doing.” Holden says.

“What?” I ask.

“Don’t you see? She’s changing literal reality.”

Aurora starts spinning as she moves in a big circle. The world starts to split its rainbow like filter. For example. Purple now splits into blue and red. Orange splits into yellow and red. With each split, the world slowly returns to its normal color. It is now, that I hear something. It sounds like music I can barely hear. Tickling the outer reaches of my perception. To me the music sounds like blues. Holden tells me later he heard metal. Rabies said it sounded like hip hop to him. Grave didn’t say shit when I asked her later. Later, Aurora tells me that the music sounded like melancholy Motown. With her arms swaying, the little shooting stars move with her. Like she is guiding them. It is beautiful. Imagine the biggest flock of birds you’ve ever seen moving as one. Aurora flings her arms into the air. All of the shooting stars fly into her and then I to the sky. There is an explosion that knocks all of us onto the ground. When we stand, the world has returned to normal. We run to Aurora, who has collapsed to the ground.
“Aurora!” I yell as I get to her.

I look to Holden.
“She’s out. Ok. Hold on. I’ll tell the mayor that things are fixed as you take her to Jolene. Then we haul ass home.”

Holden nods.

Grave watches all of this and gently says.
“Fuck this shit.”
Then she walks off.",3,1735326917.0,MythosIndustries,1,1.0,False

I typically grind my coffee with my Baratza Encore at the 14 setting. I’ve tried to replicate a similar brew using my new 1zpresso Q2, but the results have been terrible. 

So after adjusting my Q2 for a few days I found that 56 clicks produces a similar grind size to my Encore at 14, but the final brew has a totally different taste. The coffee just seems off. When I grind any finer in the 40-50 clicks range my coffee has a sour taste which is weird because I thought sour coffee is a result from under extraction. Then if I grind any more course my coffee is weak…

The only thing I can think of is that my Encore grinder was producing more fines which resulted in stronger coffee that I got accustomed to? I don’t know what to do. I was really looking forward to using the Q2 in my travel setup.",1,1735326811.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1hnmeq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1hnmeq2/uscanada_electricians_foreigner_curious_about/,(US/Canada electricians) Foreigner curious about 480/277.,"So, I’ve recently learnt that, in the US and Canada, there’s a Y480/277 V standard very widely used for feeding large buildings. Now, being myself a Brazilian programmer of microcontrollers for electrical applications, who is very unfamiliar with this system, I’m sort of curious about exactly this works:

1 -  It’s common in Brazil, even in areas where the residential standard is 115-127 V, to feed some commercial buildings (malls, office.towers) from Y380/220 V transformers. Elevators, ACs, usually use 3ph 380, and small loads run on 220. Now, do large RESIDENTIAL buildings (like 20+ storey condominium complexes) in your state/province/territory usually also get 480/277 for their elevators and lighting (I’ve seen 277 V lamps for sale) their common areas?

2 - How are small loads like computers, CCTVs systems, coffee machines, printers, etc, powered in the case of office/commercial buildings? Do these buildings usually get a separate Y208/120 V service directly from the distribution lines, specifically for their offices? Or are the 120 V in fact stepped down from the 480 V service, and then distributed to the offices?

3 - Related to #2, and assuming the answer to #1 is ‘yes’, are the apartments/condo units in residential buildings with 480/277 service usually directly served from a separate 208/120 transformer? Or is it stepped down from 480 V?

4 - In your state/province/territory, how common is it for a development to even get 480 V as opposed to the common system based around 240/208 V?",2,1735326793.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False

Typing since I can’t post the screen shot 

Him: Hey dumbass, this is Maria's father.
You are not going to do anything you are writing. In fact she is underage and if you contact her even once more I will be more than happy to share these screenshots with the police. And then we will see who ass is getting rammed in jail!!!!


Me: If this is about who I think she told she was 18, What's [her name] last name ?


Him: It is and you don't need to know a damn thing else


Me: Mr Mariano I'd like some information if you're telling me your daughter is lying

Me: She also doesn't seem to know you're monitoring her messages either, that seems interesting

For more context I’ve never seen her father but I am a very tall black guy so maybe it could be racial?

Since then we've gone on 3 dates and have a 4th set this coming Monday the 30th. The dates have been so spread out because our work schedules are completely opposite (she works afternoons and evenings including most weekends and I work a more 'regular' 9-5), however each time we get together we really click and have a great time, and despite the scheduling conflicts she keeps agreeing to see me again so I think she at least kind of likes me. 

For the first date (back in November) we got coffee, talked and had a walk around the neighborhood, the second date (early December) we met at a bar and watched some local bands, and then last week we went Christmas shopping together. After shopping we watched a movie at my apartment, and we kissed once right as she was leaving but she did tell me she'd wished I'd made a move earlier. 

So with this in mind, what could an appropriate fourth date be? I have work the next day (half day cause new years but I still have to go in in the morning).

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

","I don't use plastic in the kitchen where it can be avoided. But this had given me a great deal of fear over takeout containers, cafe coffee makers, and other instances where it couldn't be avoided.

Articles like this one in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/05/have-black-plastic-your-home-it-could-expose-you-toxic-chemicals-researchers-say/) were recommended to me over and over a couple of months ago.

Relevant bit:

>Specifically, the authors estimated that if a kitchen utensil contained middling levels of a key toxic flame retardant (BDE-209), the utensil would transfer 34,700 nanograms of the contaminant a day based on regular use while cooking and serving hot food. The authors then compared that estimate to a reference level of BDE-209 considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA’s safe level is 7,000 ng—per kilogram of body weight—per day, and the authors used 60 kg as the adult weight (about 132 pounds) for their estimate. So, the safe EPA limit would be 7,000 multiplied by 60, yielding 420,000 ng per day. That’s 12 times more than the estimated exposure of 34,700 ng per day.

>However, the authors missed a zero and reported the EPA’s safe limit as 42,000 ng per day for a 60 kg adult. The error made it seem like the estimated exposure was nearly at the safe limit, even though it was actually less than a tenth of the limit.",12,1735326207.0,moderatelygranolamoms,4,0.93,False

Why is my BG dropping so much after meals?,"I'm just curiously interested and I know that's insulin being released to deal with the protein I just ate but still curious to me.

I've been doing ketovore for about a year and a half, attaining my goal weight since begining of this year so all is great but I really wonder;

Dawn phenomenon: in first hours of the day, my BG can be anywhere between 100-110 depending how long I'm fasted. Should be normal but ive measured over 100 even 5 hours after waking up. 

I do drink about 100 to 200ml of zerocarb soy milk with my coffee every morning but I find it hard to believe this would be the cause. 

I am not measuring or purposely trying to be in ketosis, i do eat a lot of fat but it depends on the day and it's mostly ""to taste"".

Anyway, to the point.

After my carnivore meals my BG tends to drop from it's ""comfortable"" 100 range by 15-20 pretty consistently. It never goes up.

I can only get it temporarily up by 5 if I eat a 2g net carb keto snack or by +10 if I eat two of them, I like to do that a few hours after my omad in the evening when my BG drops to 85 and I start getting a little drowsy and eventually crave something small and sweet, which is ussually my last meal of the day.

Come next day BG will be at 100+ again, then back down after my lunch. Sometimes it's in 90s, it actually seems to keep it lower if I do eat something (like bulletproof).

Interestingly, my fasting BG gets even higher if I don't eat any keto processed garbage at all and I stick to a strict 24h pure carnivore omad, the highest I measured was 118 + 0.7 ketones (gluconeogenesis?) but immidiatelly after eating it drops to 85 in the next 2-3 hours. Ketones are in the low range as expected because I am not overdoing the fat, but BG always surprises me.

I just find this very interesting, not that it's anything wrong, but id love to hear if anyone else shares a similar experience, it took quite a lot of finger pricking to get this information just to satisfy my morbid curiosity, and it's not entirely accurate.",3,1735326166.0,keto,1,1.0,False

Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

I probably was in a very low state of mind using without realizing but even then I'd expected to have some sort of withdrawal because after day one I kinda realized I forgot about Zyns.

Let's face it, folks: bad breath can be a real romance killer. Imagine leaning in for that perfect kiss, only to be met with a whiff of something…less than desirable. It's a cringe-worthy moment for both parties involved. This article delves into the nitty-gritty of kissing with bad breath, exploring the causes, consequences, and – most importantly – the cures. We’ll cover everything from the science behind bad breath to practical tips for maintaining minty-fresh confidence. So, buckle up, because we’re about to embark on a journey to conquer the dreaded dragon breath and unlock the secrets to kissable confidence!

Kissing with Bad Breath: The Ultimate Mood Killer
-------------------------------------------------

We’ve all been there. You’re on a date, things are going swimmingly, and then… bam! The moment arrives, the lean-in, the anticipation…and then a wave of stale coffee and garlic hits you like a freight train. Kissing with bad breath, also known as halitosis, can turn a magical moment into a major awkward encounter. But why *is* it such a turn-off? Well, think of it this way: our sense of smell is directly linked to the emotional center of our brains. A bad smell can trigger a visceral negative reaction, almost like a built-in warning system. It's not a conscious decision to be repulsed; it’s a primal instinct.

- **The Science of Stink:** Bad breath is primarily caused by volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) produced by bacteria in the mouth. These little stinkers thrive on food particles, especially those high in protein and sugar. Think of your mouth as a bustling metropolis for bacteria, and the food debris as their all-you-can-eat buffet.
- **Beyond the Bacteria:** While poor oral hygiene is the most common culprit, other factors can contribute to bad breath, such as dry mouth, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. It's like a detective novel – sometimes you have to dig deeper to find the real culprit.

Kissing with Bad Breath: Avoiding the Awkward Encounter
-------------------------------------------------------

So, how can you avoid the dreaded bad breath kiss of doom? Don't worry, we've got you covered! There are plenty of proactive steps you can take to ensure your breath is fresh and inviting.

1. **Brush and Floss Like a Boss:** This might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people skimp on these fundamental oral hygiene practices. Think of your toothbrush and floss as your trusty sidekicks in the fight against bad breath. Brush for two minutes, twice a day, and floss daily to remove those pesky food particles that fuel the bacterial feast.
2. **Tongue Scraping: The Unsung Hero:** Your tongue is like a plush carpet for bacteria. A tongue scraper is like a powerful vacuum cleaner, effectively removing the bacterial buildup that contributes to bad breath.
3. **Hydration is Key:** Dry mouth is a breeding ground for bacteria. Keep your mouth moist by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Think of it as giving your mouth a refreshing shower from the inside out!
4. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing gum stimulates saliva production, which helps wash away food particles and neutralize acids. Opt for sugar-free varieties to avoid feeding the bacteria you’re trying to eliminate.
5. **Watch Your Diet:** Certain foods, like garlic, onions, and coffee, can linger on your breath for hours. While we wouldn’t recommend cutting them out entirely (life's too short!), be mindful of your consumption, especially before a potential kissing opportunity.

Kissing with Bad Breath: Beyond Mints and Mouthwash
---------------------------------------------------

While mints and mouthwash can offer a temporary fix, they are not a substitute for good oral hygiene. Think of them as air freshener for your mouth – they mask the smell, but don’t address the underlying cause.

- **The Mouthwash Myth:** Many mouthwashes contain alcohol, which can dry out your mouth, ironically making bad breath worse in the long run. Look for alcohol-free options or those containing ingredients like chlorine dioxide, which neutralize VSCs.
- **Mints: A Temporary Reprieve:** Mints can provide a burst of freshness, but their effects are fleeting. They’re like putting a band-aid on a bullet wound – a temporary solution to a larger problem.

Kissing with Bad Breath: When to See a Doctor
---------------------------------------------

If you’ve diligently followed all the tips and tricks and still struggle with chronic bad breath, it might be time to consult a doctor or dentist. Underlying medical conditions, such as sinus infections, tonsillitis, and even diabetes, can contribute to halitosis. Don’t be shy about seeking professional help; it's always better to be safe than sorry!

Kissing with Bad Breath: The Emotional Impact
---------------------------------------------

Bad breath can be more than just an embarrassing inconvenience; it can have a real impact on your self-esteem and social interactions. Imagine constantly worrying about your breath, holding back from conversations, or avoiding close contact. That's no way to live! Taking control of your oral health can boost your confidence and empower you to connect with others without fear or hesitation.

- **The Confidence Booster:** Fresh breath can be a powerful confidence booster. Knowing your breath is clean and inviting gives you the freedom to speak, laugh, and kiss with confidence.
- **Breaking the Ice:** Good breath can make a positive first impression. It can be the difference between a warm welcome and a subtle recoil.

Kissing with Bad Breath: The Takeaway
-------------------------------------

So, there you have it, folks! Kissing with bad breath is definitely something to avoid. But by understanding the causes, practicing good oral hygiene, and seeking professional help when needed, you can conquer the dragon breath and embrace a lifetime of fresh breath confidence. What are you waiting for? Go forth and pucker up! But hold on… wait for one more thing first.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, bad breath, particularly when kissing, is a common yet often overlooked issue that can have significant consequences on social interactions and self-esteem. While readily available solutions exist, such as proper oral hygiene, mindful dietary choices, and the use of sugar-free gum or mints, these are often temporary fixes. Chronic bad breath may indicate underlying health issues and warrants professional consultation. Ultimately, maintaining fresh breath is an essential component of confidence and facilitates positive connections with others. Addressing this issue head-on, through both proactive practices and seeking expert guidance when necessary, can transform not just your oral health but also your overall well-being and social comfort.

Hi everyone,

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal.

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis.

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him.

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself.

I do feel like I have codependency tendencies. I am realising that I fall for men who are struggling with addiction and  I adjust to this 'saviour' role. I'm scared we can never get out of this pattern after 9 years and that I can only develop a healthy relationship when I have done some serious soul searching.

What do you think? 

Thanks for taking the time to read!

First impressions: The initial impact the song had on me.

Lyrics: How much I connected with or appreciated the lyrics. For example, the line
はらはら、はらはら、はらり
晴るる原　君が詠む歌や　一輪草

Longevity: How long it took before I got tired of the song.

I've been a barista for over 3 years, it's the only type of job I've had that I actually love and enjoy and have passion for even outside of work. it's been my full time 40+ hr/week job before and it's been a part time 17/hr week while I worked 40/hrs at a good paying job before. 

when I started at my current job they were understaffed and I could only do part time because of my 2 other jobs and I noticed that it paid surprisingly well because the tips padded it so much to the point that I talked to my manager about going full time and quitting my primary job (my other job was seasonal so it was also ending) and she loved that idea, said she would get me full time hours 5 days a week. I put in my 2 weeks and quit in early November and since then my manager has been scheduling me between 20-30hrs a week, 8 times out of 10 it's always a close and we'll get maybe 20 customers my whole shift at most, ie barely any tips. like, my check was about $250 one week lol. a little less than half of my shifts actually come from me covering peoples' shifts if they don't want them or covering half shifts/staying an extra 2 hrs or being called in a few hours early if they need extra help (with manager's permission obvi. she's also said she doesn't mind if I clock in 30 mins early so sometimes I do, as long as I don't go over 40 hrs.) the most hours I've ever gotten were 35hrs and that was only because in that 1 week alone I covered shifts, called in early/stayed late, and we were open an extra few hours for an event one night and that check was an actual sustainable livable wage. and my manager constantly complains about how understaffed we are even though we are ALL getting 12-30hrs and has even hired 3 more people since I quit my other job in November 🫠

I DO keep reminding her gently that I want as many hrs as she can give (and she says she ""feels bad"" for scheduling me more than 4 days a week..) and every week it doesn't happen, I can't really afford this unfortunately but I love the shop so much, I love my coworkers, I love the regulars, overall I truly do enjoy the shop so much and I don't want to quit. 

I have told her that I AM actively looking for a 2nd job because of financial reasons and I'll let her know when I get one (and she is totally chill and understanding of that, actually most of my coworkers have 2 jobs) but every other field I've been in just sucks and takes a toll on my mental health. I get that I've gotta do what it takes to make a living though, but I'm really strongly considering applying for a 2nd coffee job. I just don't know how that would work when it comes to conflict of interest, non-compete agreements, managers and owners worrying about recipe stealing, etc. all of which are completely understandable. 

so TL;DR, does anyone have experience working at 2 shops? was there any conflict of interest, do you recommend it/recommend against it? I appreciate any input from you guys! ",2,1735325305.0,barista,1,1.0,False

I started with 1,000 worms in 2x4 concrete mix tubs. After a month of acclimation, the breeder bins are producing lots of cocoons and healthy castings, so I think things are going well.

**Breeder Bin Setup:**

* Bedding: shredded paper, coffee grounds, pulverized dry leaves.
* Moisture: like a wrung-out sponge, no pooling water.
* Feeding: a homemade worm chow (eggshells, oats, grains).

At the 21-day mark, I separate adults from cocoons using the light method, gradually pushing material aside and collecting worms and castings. However, I notice a lot of unprocessed organic material still mixed in, which makes separation tricky.

**Nursery Bin Observations:**

* Many cocoons hatch, but a significant number remain unhatched even after 6-7 weeks.
* The nursery bins are becoming clumpy due to moisture and accumulating organic material.
* I'm adding shredded paper to help with texture.

**Questions:**

1. Is it normal for cocoon hatch rates to lag behind cocoon production rates?
2. Should I just be more patient, or am I missing something?

Additional Notes:

* Temperature: steady 68-70°F in the basement.
* I don't aerate the bins during the 3-week period, and the bottom soil gets slightly compacted.

Am I overlooking any key factors? Should I aerate more frequently? Any advice on improving hatch rates or managing nursery bin buildup would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, and I'll include some photos for reference!



Nursery Bin Consistency. Moisture level sightly under breeder bin. mixture of organics and castings. Culumpty, but doesn't smell bad.

1hnlrgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hnlrgm/used_coffee_maker/,Used Coffee Maker,"I know, by the title you're assuming I found something like spiders living in my coffee machine. I assure you, it was much worse.

I'm a daily coffee drinker. Not just daily, but all throughout the day. I wake up. I make a big pot of coffee. I drink two cups. I fill a thermos to bring to work and sip on all day. It's my slow IV drip of caffeine that keeps me alive at work. We have coffee in our break room, but it's always some sort of flavor like caramel chocolate. I don't hate that stuff, but I prefer simple dark coffee that taste like the earth, so I make my own at home.

About two months ago my old coffee maker broke. It permanently switched to the ""self clean"" mode that fills the coffee maker with steam. Basically, it turned into a coffee scented humidifier. I still managed to use it for a few days, getting small cups of coffee and a very humid apartment, before a friend offered me his old coffee maker.

""It still works fine, I just upgraded to an espresso machine.""

When he brought it over he still had a full box of the filters. It was mostly clean, but still had a little water in it. The coffee pot had a lot of hard water stains on it, but that seemed normal. I washed the glass pot real well, filled it with warm water, and proceeded to brew a pot of just water. I figured running a pot of water through it would clear everything out before I brewed an actual pot of coffee.

The next day I started my usual morning routine. Make coffee. Drink coffee. Work. But this time my coffee tasted a little off and more earthy than normal. Did I forget to brush my teeth last night? I didn't worry about it and continued with my busy morning routine.

The next few pots of coffee tasted the same, but I stopped noticing it as much. My taste buds must have been growing used to it.

Then a coworker came up to me and started talking in a really hushed voice. They warned me that my office smelled like weed, and that I should take my jacket or whatever smelled like that out to my car so I don't get in trouble. I had a good laugh because I haven't smoked pot since college, then started sniffing around. When I opened my thermos my coworker immediately identified it as the skunky smell. They made a joke that their old art teacher must have drank the same brand.

Later that night when I was laying in bed I couldn't help but think about it more. Did my usual brand of coffee change flavor? Was I not washing my thermos out enough? Was my old broken coffee maker not brewing my coffee correctly? The mystery would have to wait until morning for me to figure out.

Then morning came, and I completely forgot about it. By this time I wasn't even noticing a difference in the flavor. I had only been using the coffee maker for about a week and everything seemed to go back to normal, except for the strong dank smell. It became a little joke in the office that my coffee smelled like weed.

Eventually, the joke got around to HR, who then talked to me about it. The conversation was funny, and they knew I wasn't doing drugs on the job, but told me the smell was distracting to other people in the office, and that the smell was worse than just pot. I'm usually sensitive to strong perfumes, air sprays, etc, so I was very understanding about it. I told them I would just drink break room coffee for now until I could go grocery shopping for a different brand of coffee.

The break room coffee wasn't terrible, some sort of turtle dark chocolate blend. I put up with it the next two days - Thursday and Friday. I didn't work of Saturday so I brewed my own coffee at home. The smell was horrible. It didn't just smell like weed. It was more like a week old corpse that also happened to be smoking weed. I unplugged the coffee maker/undeath scent diffuser and put it on my back porch to get it out of the house. I couldn't step inside without gagging, so I opened all my windows and took the dog for a long walk to let it air out.

About an hour later I got back home and could smell it from about a block away. As I approached my house I could hear some sort of tapping or knocking coming from my back porch. It was crows trying to break into the coffee maker. The lid was open and it was laying on it's side, but the crows were trying to get in from the bottom. I put on a pair of gloves, scared the crows off, and picked up the coffee maker. There were little peck marks all over the bottom where the heating part is sealed.

For a second I thought about getting a screw driver so I could open it, but I wasn't going to keep it after this, so I decided just to throw it on the pavement instead to break it open. I wish I would have just thrown it away. The coffee maker didn't shatter in a satisfying way, but more broke into three large chunks held together by wire. As the coffee maker hit the ground it spilled it's contents like some sort of terrible flesh filled piñata.

Some small rodent, most likely a mouse, had a litter of small pink babies and was storing food inside the bottom part of the coffee maker. When I made my first cup of coffee they were all killed, likely from boiling water. Over the next week they decomposed inside the coffee maker, slowly adding flavor to my coffee.",4,1735325116.0,nosleep,1,0.84,False

i do not have a WDT tool, and i am tamping with moderate pressure. at first i think i have have tamped too hard, so now im just pressing somewhat firmly but that does not seem to make a difference.

There are about 5 cars in line waiting for the light to turn green so they can cross or turn onto the main road.

Just as the light turns green, I can hear an ambulance about a block away on the main road approaching the intersection.  Naturally the first car at the now-green light stays put at the line, waiting for the ambulance to pass in front.

That does not sit well with the geriatric fuck sitting in his Kia Niro second in line.  Within a 1/2 second of the light turning green, he is laying on the horn.  Beep… beep… beeeeeeeep then he just leans on it continuously.

Either his hearing is gone and he doesn’t notice the ambulance, or his lead addled brain doesn’t care because green. Means. Go!

I’m next to him on the sidewalk so I raise my hand like “WTF?!” And point to the now visible ambulance that is treating its red light as a stop sign.

A normal reaction would be to mouth “oops” and do a polite wave.

A boomer reaction?  Roll down the passenger window and yell “Mind your fuckin business!” at a pedestrian.

I didn’t say anything, just gave him a big exaggerated “thumbs down” and kept walking.  He yelled something else at me but it was drowned out by the horn of the person behind him, as the ambulance had now passed, the car in front of him had driven off and HE was now sitting at a green light raging at a stranger.

It's appalling I know. Uneven but in fairness the first crack had just stopped. 

Anyway, it was roasted December 14th, I ground it to medium fine, stuck it in a French press style carafe, water was poured right before boiling and stepped for 10 minutes. 

I noticed some oil on top and apparently that's reserved for dark roasts or old beans. However, unless I'm mistaken 13 days is about when light roasts are ready to use. It was stored in a jar with a hole on top sealed by a cut up vent from a coffee bag.

I’m French and I want to come to Dublin for 6/7 months to improve my English (I think I’m A2/B1 level). I see there are many schools for learning English like Kaplan, CES, EF, Delfin, etc. Kaplan and EF are in France, they also propose accommodation in Dublin, so it’s more easy to organise from Paris. Has anyone heard good things about these schools? Some reviews online are a bit contradictory...  Do you know other good schools I can look? 

If I try to find accommodation by myself, is it very hard to find flatshares in Dublin for a few months? I’m a bit worried that the accommodation offered by EF or Kaplan but housing in Dublin seems very hard to find.   
Also, is it possible to find small jobs for 6/7 months? My English class will be in the morning, working can also help me to practice my English. I work now as assistant manager in Paris for a big international company but I was barista some years ago in a very nice coffee shop in Paris during my studies.

Thanks a lot for your advices!

Giving this a whirl as of December 27th, 2024. Using this platform to share and document my experiences.

I am in my early 30's, my height is 5' 9"" and I weigh 175+ lbs. Used to weigh 145 lbs and at my skinniest, I weighed 135 lbs. In the past two years, I have had a lot of factors influence my weight gain. 
So I am investing the time and money ($690 upfront so better stick to this and this better work) to get myself back on track and feel confident again. 

During this journey, I am also using MyFitnessPal to be aware of my daily calorie intake as well as document my workouts! I walk at least once a day for over 45 minutes but used to run 3 times a day. 
Doubt I'll be able to get back to that level but once I lose 5 to 10 lbs, I want to run again so I don't hurt joints or do something wrong in the long run (no pun intended).

My main goal is to get back to 140-145 lbs, feel confident, and learn to love running again. 

Day 1
Planning to take my prescription around 9 AM and after a small breakfast of English muffin with 1tbsp of butter and 1 cup of coffee. I read having caffeine isn't ideal with one of the prescriptions so keeping it at a cup for now since I've drank coffee since I was seven years old.

I am taking 1 tablet of buproprion XL and then 1/2 a tablet of topiramate IR + B12 every other day. 

Going to be drinking at least 2 liters of water a day. Adding half a lemon for juice helps add a little flavor. 

For lunch, I am having a blueberry protein shake that is 240 cal and has other good vitamins that don't conflict with my Hers prescription. Also going to take the dog on a small walk. 

Dinner, having leftover Asian food with my partner because we were exhausted after the major holidays. Little nervous how the foods will influence how I feel but that is on me for not planning better. 😅
However, we both agreed veggies and good proteins the rest of the week/weekend!

I know it doesn't have a screen and they're limited to using the lights/buttons to convey status. But they could at least have much better and clearer documentation.

1hnl5vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1hnl5vq/day_1/,DAY 1🎉🎉🎉,"Hey guys, it’s officially been 24 hours!! 

*Here are some things I noticed*

1.) i tried quitting in the summer, and went 13 days strong. my withdrawals were way worse, i remember just within the first day i was crying, and felt like i couldn’t do it. i stayed in bed all day and didn’t have any motivation, but this time although it (only been one day,) it’s different! i think last time i felt way too bad for myself, i didn’t want to quit, i FORCED myself to quit. i went in the whole quitting process as something “negative” and “dreadful”, i didn’t quit for myself, i quit for my parents. which yes, is a good reason, but it’s not enough, and you should be doing it for yourself as well!

2.) I set my intentions: 
I have a vision of who i want to be in 2025, and vaping isn’t something that will contribute to that version of myself. i don’t want to be controlled by nicotine for my whole life, and i genuinely want to be unrecognizable by mid 2025.

3.) I put some common sense into my head. I told myself i rather deal with the 2 weeks, to even a month. of hard, and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms, but that month MAX, of being in a bad mood, and upset will be way more worth it then cutting my life short. i don’t want 20 years to pass, and i go into a hospital because my lungs collapsed or even worse. i don’t wanna ever be put into a situation where i tell myself “man i should’ve just quit, before its too late” im sick & tired of feeling like im slowly killing my self. 

4.) Using this as a way to be productive, since i need to keep myself distracted im finding things to do. so far in the past 24 hours, i washed my car, deep cleaned my room, did a lot of skin care, took a nice long everything shower, picked up some coffee for my family etc…! and it’s been helping me keep my mind off things. :) 

Sorry for my huge rant, it helps me get this off my chest!! You guys got this, stay strong!! I’ll keep yall updated ",7,1735323562.0,quittingsmoking,3,0.9,False

Sadly, a few weeks ago, it’s almost like they’ve stopped working overnight. 
And it’s not tolerance, because I actually hurt myself and was off work for a few weeks prior and didn’t take meds at all. 
The biggest factor has been the weather. It’s December in Canada, it’s been soooo dark. 
It’s almost like my depression has completely trumped the medication?
A little indicator is that usually, even a cup of coffee with my meds will make me feel like I’m having a heart attack. Now I can do several cups of coffees AND meds, and still  no motivation or focus. 
I’m seeing my doctor next week about possibly going on antidepressants….
Just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this? 🩷

I learned sketching by myself on the internet and found many good resources about it.

However, searching the acrylics tutorials, lessons or step-by-step paintings i found very little. And those that i found are usually landscapes... why is this? I am getting discouraged because i cannot find a good resource for learning.

Maybe i am dumb and can't find any? For sketching (or animation) there are many free resources, videos and even courses you can take, but acrylics are usually timelapses of paintings and the actual tutorials are plain boring (in my opinion). Where are all the artists painting a girls figure in a dress, an aston martin, a beautiful busy city streets, the coffee-shop/first date vibe, the monaco formula 1 chaos... i found none. I only found Bob Ross-type painting tutorials of different seasons with a damn cabine in the middle of the painting (I love Bob Ross tho). Maybe i am wrong, please prove it to me, i know that it's about the technique of painting and not the setting, but how am i going to learn if i'm only learning through landscape painting?",0,1735323270.0,ArtistLounge,12,0.36,False

It sparked a desire to create one, as my good buddy is a bigger Opeth fan than myself; And as I pulled him for Secret Santa, it seemed apropos of a mutual interest at the very least. The original is currently hanging framed in his office.

\- Strathmore Watercolor 400 series (12 in. x 18 in.) paper  
\- Pigma Micron (005, 01, 03, 05, 08, 10, 12, 2) archival pens

\- Bic Willie Nelson approved lighter (yellow)  
\- No name Watercolor pigments  
\- Photoshop for small edits and cropping

It was fun to just hang out and listen to every Opeth record in order, and try to come up with concepts and Easter eggs, of which there are a good few (most less clever than others) while channeling my inner gradeschooler. Currently in process of cleaning up a bit more as Staples industrial series scanner (and the indifferent employee) did a less than adequate job.
